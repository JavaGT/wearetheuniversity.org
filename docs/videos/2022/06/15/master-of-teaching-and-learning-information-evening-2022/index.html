you will all agree i<br>already know they're special so<br>it was very exciting actually i just<br>went down to i've just come back from<br>the mighty bell cluther anyone from belk<br>luther here<br>oh you're missing out so i was there<br>today<br>and i walked into that staff room and<br>there was like heaps of there was a kid<br>i taught when he was in um well fourth<br>form back in the day that's how old he<br>is and then there was<br>yeah i know that's how old i am<br>and so i taught him in year 10 and now<br>he's a teacher there and there was like<br>10 other people that have come through<br>the program in recent years and it's<br>pretty special so<br>we are all here tonight because you were<br>interested in the noble profession of<br>teaching<br>and<br>i'm happy to say<br>that i am too part of that so all of<br>your lecturers<br>that<br>you'll meet tonight and all the<br>lecturers in the program<br>we're all registered teachers so we<br>chose like you at some stage in our<br>career to come teaching and it is<br>something that we will do and will hold<br>our registration near to our heart is<br>like an identity thing i am a teacher<br>hear me raw sometimes you can really<br>hear me raw<br>so it is quite a<br>privilege and an honor to be a teacher<br>and you get more out of it than you ever<br>give it is a wonderful wonderful<br>profession so we'll tell you a little<br>bit about that tonight<br>but first let's start with the karakia<br>and just because i like to mix things up<br>so<br>let's let's talk about um this is quite<br>a common one but let's talk about what<br>it means first and i'm going to do some<br>actions and you're welcome to join in i<br>promise you i won't judge you okay<br>and it's it's um<br>it's exciting all right so it goes peace<br>be everywhere<br>let the oceans for your journey be calm<br>and glistening like green stone the<br>shimmering light across the water will<br>guide your journey<br>oh it's good to be alive<br>and so when it talks about um<br>the shimmering light it means that it's<br>about making good decisions so we all<br>think that you should make a good<br>decision about<br>teaching in the future so we're going to<br>do that together now obviously you<br>already know the action's off by heart<br>so we're going to have a go so kiyohora<br>everyone<br>so tonight we're going to talk about why<br>we think that um<br>we're going to sally a little bit about<br>the teaching and the programs we'll talk<br>a little bit more about the programs and<br>give you some information about applying<br>um you'll have an opportunity to ask<br>questions at the end and you can ask<br>general questions in front of the group<br>and then you can also talk to the<br>individual program coordinators as well<br>to ask individual questions if you're on<br>live stream you can send a message<br>through the facebook<br>page there's a messenger function there<br>and you can send a message to to that<br>page<br>okay it's going to press play now and<br>i'm going to wait patiently for the play<br>sign to come up sonia yeah or do i touch<br>it<br>the mouse<br>okay oh<br>it's like<br>every day is just a bit better<br>i chose otago because it's<br>nice and close to home i can still<br>thank you<br>cool would you better look after it for<br>a wee minute i've just got to do this<br>video and then i'll be able to come find<br>it with you<br>kia ora my name is kane johnson my name<br>is erica cormac<br>my name is sami<br>hi i'm alicia de corsi i am a third year<br>student doing a bachelor of teaching in<br>dalston primary education i think the<br>really great thing about the college of<br>education is the fact that the lecturers<br>are always available for you so you can<br>go and ask for help or guidance or just<br>anything really and i think that's what<br>makes the college of education really<br>special the topoka unit<br>is an opportunity for anybody to be part<br>of uh whether you're towie you're maori<br>or pacifica it doesn't matter it's not<br>just about speaking maori it's about the<br>concepts and ideas behind it and giving<br>you a bit of<br>a better worldview i guess of of our tea<br>maori and how we can incorporate that<br>and it's something to be<br>celebrated<br>and not afraid of the early childhood<br>program involves a bit of class time<br>which is<br>lectures tutorials and workshops<br>you do that usually about four days a<br>week<br>then you get put in an early childhood<br>centre and<br>yeah that's sort of when you get to put<br>into practice everything you've learned<br>in class ah good work placement's been<br>awesome<br>i find that i've been learning a lot<br>more very quickly in my time here and<br>also has been good pairing up with<br>teachers with mental teachers to help us<br>who are quite young in the profession<br>quite fresh to be able to practice and<br>develop our pedagogies too once you get<br>into the school and you're in the class<br>environment you really realise why<br>you're doing the degree the kids<br>absolutely love having student teachers<br>and it gives you a chance to<br>experience life as a teacher you see how<br>busy it is but also how amazing it is<br>especially when you see students make<br>progress or you realize that you have a<br>really cool impact on their life<br>can't speak highly enough of the<br>lecturers and the support that we get<br>and also from the students that you're<br>you're working alongside as well yeah<br>yeah we'll go with one of that and then<br>you're building that sense of whanau and<br>getting each other through<br>in terms of the lecturers they are very<br>helpful very informative very<br>knowledgeable people and it's awesome to<br>know that if we are struggling that we<br>are able to approach them on a more<br>pastoral conversation that's very<br>comforting and very reassuring for a<br>student who's not from here there wasn't<br>ever really another option for me i<br>always wanted to come to otago<br>with the ousa<br>at their events and things like that<br>brings you into the whole dunedin<br>experience i think and<br>on your map<br>so<br>one of the things that's really special<br>about the college of education you've<br>all had different um some of you<br>actually may just still be at school and<br>thinking about this in the future but<br>many of you have already been through<br>university and done an undergraduate<br>degree we find<br>a lot of the departments you come from<br>are really really supportive but that is<br>probably a main<br>feature of our college of education so<br>we've got a really<br>structured pastoral care system and it's<br>a whanau we get to know you really well<br>we know all your names um we follow up<br>on you we go hey haven't heard different<br>from you a while we're we're watching<br>and and it really is um we we guide you<br>in your journey and we really care about<br>you and know you as people<br>so the other thing is there's lots of<br>placement time in early childhood<br>settings in schools so you're in and out<br>all year<br>heaps of fun<br>so a lot of people in uni not my<br>daughter alicia so i don't want to go to<br>class today but that's not the same here<br>and<br>great career preparation so um<br>natalie one of the graduates from the<br>2020<br>this is 2020 she was biology science<br>university of otago offers many<br>opportunities to ensure you're ready to<br>begin your teaching career the degree<br>has been well planned and offers a<br>little bit of everything so we actually<br>foster your career as well so we help<br>you plan your cv and<br>help you get into the job market and<br>things like that so it really is a wrap<br>around care<br>um and i'll ask michael to speak in a<br>minute i just want to say that<br>we offer particular in specific pastoral<br>care for maori pacifica students um and<br>with our kayafina maori in pacifica so<br>here<br>i was like michael is here<br>and out of the g at the genie out of the<br>box and he'll tell you a little bit<br>great to see everybody here<br>so the cafe program is just one of those<br>many layers that are in the college to<br>keep an eye on people<br>and see that you're doing okay<br>especially for the masters uh actually<br>it's amy curtis who takes that role from<br>across the masters program<br>where you start at the beginning of<br>january and you're right there till the<br>end of december<br>and it is<br>a big race and compared to potentially<br>the<br>undergrad it's like you're doing a whole<br>year and a half and one year<br>so there's a lot of pressure and we like<br>to<br>make sure that everybody's<br>who signed up and get through to the<br>other end<br>and that's our challenge as all the<br>staff to look after people but the kai<br>athena program has put in just to keep<br>an extra eye on uh those who are moldy<br>or pacifica um<br>as a as one of those layers<br>yeah i think that's<br>that covers it um so yeah come on board<br>and we'll make sure you get to the end<br>that's that's that's our aspiration<br>hi<br>but all students in the program we<br>really do have a wrap around care<br>program<br>and as michael said the program starts<br>in um about january the 16th<br>or so but middle of january and um goes<br>to about the middle of december so it is<br>a<br>long program in terms of the university<br>year it's like the university year plus<br>a summer school at either end does that<br>make sense because you're doing 180<br>points in one year so six 30 point<br>papers<br>okay<br>so um it is a postgraduate so not even a<br>graduate or it's a postgraduate initial<br>teacher education qualification and you<br>can get it in early childhood primary<br>and secondary education<br>our bachelor of teaching programs you<br>can do in dunedin in invercargill but in<br>the master of teaching and we only offer<br>it in dunedin um<br>as i said six compulsory papers they're<br>broken into three parts so you've got<br>curriculum a couple of curriculum papers<br>a couple of<br>around professional experience or<br>researching your professional experience<br>and researching students learning within<br>professional experience and then<br>the more the educational theory papers<br>around diversity and inclusion and<br>theories of learning so it's sort of<br>broken into three parts um you have to<br>have<br>so teaching council requirement you<br>might have heard the news about teaching<br>council in the last couple of days i'll<br>let you look that up yourselves but the<br>um you have to have spent at least 80<br>days in the program within an early<br>childhood setting or in a school<br>really excellent employment outcomes so<br>i can particularly talk about the<br>secondary program for example um that is<br>um we've basically had<br>um up till covert we had a hundred<br>percent employment rate with covered<br>things have been a little bit<br>differently but it's it's it's um very<br>very high in the 90<br>of employment<br>so and it will be similar like that for<br>the other ones as well i just happen to<br>know about secondary so as i said we<br>offer early childhood primary and<br>secondary and we have the wonderful<br>sonya gacious who's going to come and<br>talk to you about the early childhood<br>i'm not from around here originally you<br>can probably tell that<br>i'm originally from the states<br>uh<br>grew up in eastern kansas and then spent<br>30 years teaching<br>little people<br>well yeah<br>and teacher education in in arizona<br>where it was like the opposite of here<br>otherwise<br>anyways um yes so our wonderful early<br>childhood education program we were the<br>last of the of the sectors to join the<br>masters teaching learning program we are<br>the smallest<br>um<br>as you're going to hear over and over<br>tonight<br>how um<br>this program has relationships the<br>relationships are so important<br>in early childhood<br>everything starts with the relationships<br>but in teaching everything starts with<br>relationships too so we really embody<br>that um<br>i really like the idea that we're really<br>we're not watching you like creepy wise<br>we're watching because it is part of<br>that relationship with money you really<br>make sure that you do well and that you<br>are totally prepared to go out and work<br>with our tamariki<br>so<br>this is early childhood teaching<br>it may look like just sitting on a<br>sandbox having fun with little we people<br>which a lot of it is that's very true<br>but there's a lot of learning that's<br>going on there um in our third new<br>zealand we focus on children's learning<br>dispositions<br>and the working theories they have about<br>the world<br>and extending and expanding all of those<br>so in this picture um you'll see our<br>kayako sitting there with these children<br>who are probably developing some<br>dispositions around courage<br>taking that credit to sleep into that<br>sandbox<br>and exploring the textures and the sand<br>that can oftentimes go flying<br>when working on with them on<br>uh collaborating filling that pale<br>together learning alongside the with<br>others<br>um naomi's always real good to point out<br>there's lots of maths happening in there<br>filling up that bucket counting how many<br>shovelfuls it's going to take to fill<br>that bucket exciting stuff<br>exciting very exciting physics chemistry<br>dry sand wet sand how does it flow does<br>it flow up<br>what throws better wet sand dries so all<br>this kind of learning is happening and<br>the kayako is there guiding that asking<br>beautiful open-ended questions<br>how did that happen what i wonder what<br>would happen if and just really<br>facilitating and expanding the<br>children's learning<br>so that's a lot of what you see um in<br>early childhood we do lots of planning<br>people don't think you do but we do<br>we look at children's learning we assess<br>what's happening there but looking for<br>those learning dispositions looking for<br>their working theories<br>writing a little story about what we<br>noticed that day<br>kind of<br>um<br>deconstructing them finding meaning in<br>that learning finding we think's<br>happening there and then figuring out<br>what we can do the next day or in five<br>minutes to extend and expand that so<br>it's very active very engaging um<br>and i'll be honest there's probably<br>nothing better than a good<br>cut off one of those little cherubs<br>along the way too all right so it is a<br>one-year program as we've mentioned<br>only offered here in dunedin it<br>qualifies you to teach zero to<br>five six mostly five because they tend<br>to go to school after that<br>in kindergarten's child care centers and<br>any other early childhood type settings<br>such as home-based care<br>play centers other places<br>i'm the program coordinator<br>don't think that's all i think following<br>because<br>andrea robertson you're up next to talk<br>it's lovely to have you all here today<br>and i am the primary program coordinator<br>for the bachelor of teaching and masters<br>so<br>we probably don't want to do a show of<br>hands but you could just do a little who<br>is here thinking about primary<br>oh yes<br>i was just interested to see welcome<br>welcome hey welcome to the best job in<br>the world and this goes for secondary<br>and early childhood as well<br>i'm biased i've been a teacher for 25<br>years and it is just a whole lot of fun<br>you will have days where you are just<br>you know finding it so rewarding you'll<br>have days where you're finding it really<br>challenging<br>there will be laughter there will be<br>tears<br>seriously but there'll also be a whole<br>lot of laughter because working with<br>children with young<br>teenagers with students you just never<br>quite know what's going to happen every<br>day is different<br>for me<br>one of the highlights of being a teacher<br>is the relationships the connections<br>that you make with your<br>students and i love you know if i'm at<br>the street or at a work stu and<br>actually just last year i was at a<br>workstation with my husband and i got<br>this tap on my shoulder and are you<br>listening and i looked around enough and<br>there's this big tall man um and i<br>taught him when he was about six or<br>seven and he and i my call for the class<br>was are you listening and so you know<br>and he then<br>he said i loved you i loved being your<br>class i remember all the singing i<br>remember the puppet it was called mr<br>wuzzle um you know he just he just went<br>on and on about all the stuff that he<br>remembered and<br>you know i've had that happen a lot<br>and it just brings home it's not he<br>didn't remember the amazing maths lesson<br>or the hands-on science which would have<br>been amazing and hands-on but he<br>remembered the relationship and the fun<br>and the care and that is the privilege<br>of being a teacher that you get to make<br>those connections with young people and<br>inspire them<br>and just and just watch them grow you<br>know in that year that they're with you<br>or if you're lucky enough in those you<br>know few years that they're with you<br>speaking of the music another real<br>highlight of being a teacher is you get<br>to bring your passion and interest into<br>the classroom and share that with your<br>young learners and so for me music<br>literacy well-being technology are<br>probably my you know real passion areas<br>and so i'm a teacher that shares a lot<br>of that<br>for anyone that is looking at applying<br>especially for any primary people here<br>when we do the interview with you we<br>want to hear about your passions and<br>your strengths so come along to the<br>interview really to share these with us<br>we also just want to really get to know<br>you<br>we would also love to know that you've<br>been out into a school and you've had<br>some time firstly just checking that<br>teaching is for you<br>there's nothing worse than coming into<br>this career if you don't like children<br>so going out into a school seriously is<br>go out and check you know you might<br>think hey i've always wanted to be a<br>teacher i loved school i loved you know<br>my teachers go and spend some time in a<br>classroom just to double check before<br>you invest in this program in future<br>career you know a day in a classroom and<br>you'll get that feeling of oh yes this<br>is me<br>equally in the interview we will ask you<br>if you've had an opportunity to be out<br>in a school and it's a great thing to be<br>able to talk about as well and make<br>those connections<br>um so yes you're heading into one of the<br>best jobs around<br>completely biased as i said so the<br>master's program um is pretty unique and<br>this year we've got 40 um or just under<br>40 students doing the master's program<br>primary and so you're going to be with<br>these people from as everyone's saying<br>january to december you're going to get<br>to know your<br>peers really well<br>we get to know you really well as well<br>we know you by name<br>and that's a real bonus of the masters<br>program as well<br>as it's been mentioned you're going to<br>go on placements and primary you have<br>two main placements and i've got logan<br>shortly who will come and have a chat to<br>you about<br>what it's like being a master's student<br>but just to let you know you'll do one<br>junior placement in primary and then in<br>a different school in semester two<br>you'd do a senior or vice versa you also<br>go out and spend at least eight<br>wednesdays in the schools in the build<br>up to each placement so you get to spend<br>a lot of time in school it's<br>a you know an exciting part of your<br>program<br>the papers i think has already been<br>mentioned but you do a mixture of<br>curriculum so that is your music science<br>drama dance maths um so you'll learn a<br>little bit about all the curriculum<br>areas you'll learn the theory<br>and the effect of teaching practice and<br>then the placement you're putting it all<br>into practice<br>another question i often get asked<br>around not just the study that you're<br>doing here<br>but also the assignments i must say with<br>the<br>curriculum subjects it is really<br>hands-on so it's a small group when<br>we're doing music you'll be playing<br>instruments when you're learning about<br>pe you will be playing games and using<br>equipment so the learning is a nice<br>mixture of theory and hands-on and a<br>whole lot of fun<br>but the assignments also are quite<br>varied as well coming out of your<br>undergraduate degrees you may have<br>written a lot of essays or a particular<br>type of assignment in the masters<br>program we have a lovely variety of<br>assignments some of them are lesson<br>plans unit plans some of them are video<br>recordings<br>you know a good mixture and you'll still<br>get the odd essay in things as well<br>it is a masters level program and so as<br>has been mentioned it will be a step up<br>but there are lots of supports in place<br>and i think you'll find it really<br>rewarding<br>a good level of challenge<br>as well<br>so i could go on and on as i said i'm<br>incredibly biased about primary teaching<br>and just this whole<br>career but i'd love to hand over to<br>logan now logan russell is in our<br>masters primary program she's literally<br>given up a night of planning and<br>preparation for her teaching she's out<br>on placement at the moment and she may<br>share with you about some of the fun<br>she's had today because it's real life<br>so my name is logan and as andrea said i<br>am a primary masters student<br>um<br>there are so many incredible things that<br>i could say about the college of<br>education and<br>all of the experiences that you'll have<br>but i think one of the main things that<br>i do want to mention is just that how<br>supportive the staff are<br>they do mention that they're watching<br>and they are as naomi is doing right now<br>she is watching<br>um but they are watching in a supportive<br>way where<br>you can go to them if you're feeling<br>upset you can go to them if you have no<br>clue what's happening which will happen<br>um but they're also just there if you<br>want to have a yarn about your day<br>they're really interested<br>which is really helpful<br>um<br>so the support that you will have in<br>this program is incredible<br>um but there is no sugar coating it it<br>is hard it's a lot um there will be<br>moments where you will feel completely<br>overwhelmed but then<br>counter to that there will be moments<br>where you feel so much pride for what<br>you're doing and so much excitement<br>and you find that teaching becomes who<br>you are and your whole personality<br>becomes teaching<br>where now i get excited about bugs<br>in the river<br>i've never been excited about bugs in my<br>life until today<br>i spent<br>three hours with seven and<br>eight-year-olds<br>up to my knees in a river looking for<br>bugs and worms that lived under rocks<br>and i didn't think that was ever going<br>to be me but it is<br>just something that you can't explain it<br>is just a feeling that when you are with<br>your students<br>and you look at them and they look back<br>at you with so much wonder because<br>they're like you have so much knowledge<br>and you're like do i<br>but to them you do have a lot of<br>knowledge and a lot of that does come<br>from the curriculum that you do learn in<br>class<br>the discussions that you have with your<br>peers are so important everyone comes<br>with a different background everyone<br>comes with different contexts that they<br>understand<br>and the conversations you have in class<br>really do inform what you do in the<br>you've heard it so much already but the<br>connections you make with people they<br>are the most important thing<br>and<br>it's really important to get to know<br>your peers because these will be the<br>people that will be crying with you<br>after your lesson did not go very well<br>because some kid decided that they<br>weren't listening<br>but they will also be the people that<br>celebrate with you when everything went<br>completely right and every child passed<br>the assessment that you set for them<br>and they're looking at you like oh my<br>god i understand<br>and those moments just do make it<br>absolutely incredible and that's when<br>you know that this is the job that you<br>if there's any advice i could give is<br>just to take every opportunity<br>especially the ones that are terrifying<br>because those tend to be the ones that<br>give you the most<br>there will be a lot of opportunities and<br>you'll be like ah<br>i could go home and nap don't go home in<br>that intake vitamin c at the start of<br>the year the germs will find you<br>you will get sick and tissues will be<br>your best friend so take the vitamin c<br>otherwise<br>it just just take the vitamin c<br>thank you<br>kyoto logan<br>and um that's um primary and you don't<br>cry that much i promise<br>so um now we're moving on to secondary i<br>should say that the primary and early<br>childhood you could also do as a<br>three-year bachelor of teaching as well<br>but of course many of you are here<br>because you're interested in the one<br>year<br>and before i introduce the next person i<br>should should qualify this i'm actually<br>an experienced secondary school teacher<br>myself and so secondary is a real<br>passion of mine maths obviously um you<br>know it's the most interesting subject<br>in the world um<br>so everyone's nodding and smiling that's<br>really good i'll see you next year um so<br>now i want to introduce you to ian<br>mcgillcrest who is the secondary program<br>coordinator i almost feel like a drum<br>roll with that great jacket you just put<br>on<br>can i thank you so much naomi um can i<br>just say look thank you so much to all<br>of you for being so polite and nodding<br>politely at naomi's love of maths<br>they're<br>so kirakoto my name is ian mcgilchrist<br>i'm a english teacher who's now moved up<br>to the college of education here to um<br>help contribute to the future teachers<br>of new zealand my background has been<br>teaching english here in new zealand and<br>also overseas and i've been involved<br>with student teachers as a mentor<br>teacher since 1996.<br>um so now it's a real privilege for me<br>to be here um working with the current<br>generation of student teachers and i<br>love going out into schools as i'm doing<br>at the moment and seeing some of my uh<br>sort of men mentee student teachers from<br>years ago now acting as the mentors for<br>the current um year of students coming<br>through so it's a real privilege<br>i think the one thing that really<br>strikes me about teaching is that it's<br>an enormous responsibility<br>but hugely rewarding<br>to be able to contribute to the future<br>of young people in our country is<br>absolutely rewarding um and i was saying<br>just before uh tonight uh about<br>six or so weeks ago i bumped into a<br>former student of mine who's now 40<br>or 41s about 41<br>and i was his year 10 teacher for social<br>studies and he remembered me and i<br>barely recognized him<br>but we launched immediately into a<br>discussion his first question was hey<br>you're mr mcgilkes and i said yeah<br>that's right he said i'm i'm<br>my name i'll keep him anonymous and then<br>the next thing he said was tell us what<br>you think about what's going on in the<br>ukraine at the moment i thought we<br>launched into her and i hadn't seen him<br>since he was 16.<br>and so it was just and we talked about<br>school and did some reminiscing but it<br>was so lovely um knowing that gosh<br>maybe a tiny tiny part in helping that<br>young person become a fantastic adult<br>the way he is today<br>are you doing the slides with your fancy<br>rose gold clicker okay lovely so<br>um<br>with<br>the master of teaching learning is the<br>the only uh avenue into secondary<br>teaching that we have here at the<br>university which is the sort of point of<br>difference between early childhood<br>teaching and primary teaching so where<br>you do have the bachelor of teaching<br>option as well<br>if you<br>complete the program you are qualified<br>to teach in a whole range of schools in<br>new zealand<br>years 7 to 13 so that's ages<br>about age 11 up to about age 18.<br>you're qualified to teach in secondary<br>schools they can be private schools<br>state integrated schools<br>they can be area schools a whole wide<br>range of things<br>probably to be<br>fair most of the students in the program<br>uh end up teaching in the years 9 to 13<br>bracket but it's we still do have a good<br>number of teachers who<br>do teach in the year seven and eight i<br>was out on the road visiting students<br>watching them teach this week<br>and we have a wonderful teacher at<br>mackenzie college in fairly and she's<br>teaching year seven and eight chinese as<br>well as year 13 economics so it's a good<br>broad range of experiences that you'll<br>get<br>i'll say a little bit about placement<br>but i'll try not to repeat any of the<br>information that my colleagues have<br>already given you because a lot of what<br>sonja had said and a lot of what andrea<br>had said applies all equally to the<br>secondary program so what they said<br>about uh the the different papers and<br>you know curriculum and sort of context<br>your papers professional practice that<br>all applies for secondary as well<br>obviously the key difference is for your<br>professional experiences your place in<br>secondary schools<br>and with the secondary program we have<br>about 75 students in the program<br>and that means that not all can be<br>placed in dunedin so<br>if you're looking at secondary you can<br>expect to be placed somewhere else in<br>new zealand<br>but we work with you with that we ask<br>you where you might want to go<br>so at the moment we have got students in<br>wellington uh we've got students in<br>palmerston north invercargill uh fairley<br>or<br>all over the place central otago okay so<br>we will work with you to try and place<br>you somewhere that um you'd also<br>like to go and be but it's useful for<br>you just to be aware of<br>that um<br>yeah yeah absolutely<br>i suppose my role here is actually just<br>a long-winded introduction to two of our<br>students here who are going to talk to<br>you i think<br>i did i'd sort of come forward come<br>forward you two now i'm i'm not going to<br>introduce jack gilmore and molly as<br>stars of the program you're not stars of<br>the program your entire constellations<br>okay<br>superstars i'm going to pass over to<br>jack and to molly who'll be able to tell<br>you more about the program and i will<br>stick around at the end if you've got<br>any particular<br>questions that you'd like to ask of me<br>you know particularly around things like<br>teaching subjects and what that might<br>mean for your paper selection if you're<br>still studying for your degree maybe for<br>a semester too<br>okay over to you<br>uh<br>i'm teaching currently history at kings<br>at the moment uh i'm having the time of<br>my life<br>teaching history at king's it's really<br>really fun um a little bit about me um i<br>went to logan park high school i had<br>just<br>heaps and heaps of teachers that i found<br>really inspirational and motivational um<br>so when i was in year 13 i kind of<br>decided that i'd be a high school<br>teacher so um i went to university i've<br>done my three years<br>and have gone into the teaching program<br>i tried to do as much as i could at<br>university like extracurricular subjects<br>and like<br>like a wide range of subjects so i could<br>get like multiple um<br>teaching areas that i could do like<br>english and media studies as well so<br>yeah that's cool um<br>the program is really really really fun<br>um it's the best time i've had in at<br>university for my four years um it's<br>really great meeting people like molly<br>we get we get together socially quite a<br>lot so that's really fun<br>um<br>the<br>teachers naomi ian melissa over there<br>all fantastic they're just you know you<br>can flick them an email and they'll<br>respond to you in 15 minutes it's you<br>know yeah and ian's great he teaches me<br>and molly for english and you know he's<br>always got some great advice for how we<br>can do things so yeah um placement is<br>really really fun i have learned so much<br>in these um<br>yeah<br>i have learned more in five weeks about<br>myself and about anything that i did in<br>you know three years of university so<br>that's really really good<br>um<br>i'm gonna be a bit contrarian to here<br>and say although it's a masters course i<br>i think the workload's actually pretty<br>manageable<br>yeah i mean it's it's harder than 300<br>level university but like it's it's<br>definitely like if you're prepared to<br>put in the work then<br>yeah it's fine um<br>yeah i would definitely recommend if you<br>want to be a high school teacher um<br>definitely go to a high school<br>beforehand because the teenagers can be<br>a bit frightening i was uh i my first<br>year nine english class i took um it was<br>fifth period<br>um<br>on a friday<br>i went in<br>they they didn't stop yelling for the<br>entire period it was<br>it was like oh no i've done everything<br>wrong<br>but you know<br>since then they've come to to come to<br>know me i'm really liking them they like<br>me it's really really rewarding when<br>they tell you that you're their favorite<br>teacher so yeah it's great uh anyway<br>i'll pass it on to molly now<br>thank you jack talofa everyone uh ko<br>molly tokuikua um yeah i would love to<br>first start um<br>by agreeing with jack about the<br>socializing part of the masters program<br>i've met more awesome people<br>in the last five months than i have in<br>my entire life and we do we've got a<br>chat on social media called masters of<br>socializing and it literally never stops<br>beeping and we're just sharing stories<br>about the teaching that we've been doing<br>constantly and<br>i've learned so much from the people in<br>the course<br>but as well as the amazing<br>lecturers that we have here at otago i<br>think<br>the first impression that i had was<br>coming to the masters is like going to<br>school but it's just only your favorite<br>teacher<br>which is really great because i feel<br>everyone here is of course<br>a trained teacher but of course very<br>good teachers because they've gone on to<br>teach teachers<br>so that's been a really really awesome<br>part of it<br>um<br>as we're saying we're on placement at<br>the moment i'm at otago boys um it's<br>been absolutely fantastic it's so<br>rewarding to<br>work with the students the first week<br>was really hard and then i got to know<br>the students and i feel so invested in<br>their lives and in their future and<br>it's it's not hard anymore it's really<br>easy to fill yourself with enthusiasm to<br>go back and keep teaching so that's<br>really really awesome<br>in terms of the workload i feel similar<br>to jack that um<br>i was expecting it to be more crazy but<br>i think that it's because the<br>assignments are very practical<br>um as well as really creative one of the<br>assignments we're doing at the moment is<br>to you write a narrative about a<br>situation that happened to you in class<br>and then<br>yeah you do some pretty dense reading<br>about it and then you um talk about that<br>at the end but you know a lot of it is<br>really really creative and um<br>supportive towards um<br>it makes sense in in the reflections<br>that we're doing it is making us<br>better teachers um<br>yeah i think that's all i wanted to<br>share so i might pass that back to oh<br>one more thing<br>um just to sell the uh the secondary<br>part of it instead of the primary or<br>early childhood part<br>it's it's really great that if you have<br>done a subject at university that you<br>really love like i i did history for my<br>three years and i i love every part of<br>history so like the other day i i was in<br>my 13 history class and some kid we just<br>had about a 20-minute discussion about<br>the history of colonialism in southeast<br>asia and it was like completely off<br>topic but it's like really cool to be<br>able to like share your knowledge with<br>kids about certain topics and all that<br>sort of stuff so i'm sure naomi can say<br>more about maths and teenagers so yeah<br>yeah<br>i might just wait one more point um<br>about the application process so one of<br>the things we had to talk about was<br>application process and i would say the<br>number one most important thing is to<br>consider<br>um your engagement and your<br>understanding of teal maori as well as<br>your dedication to territory<br>that comes up a lot in the application<br>process and it's really important to<br>education in new zealand to be<br>knowledgeable about uh treaty<br>relationships<br>i would highly recommend doing maori one<br>one o and maori 102 in semester two if<br>you've got any space for them so that's<br>i'm conversational maori as well as<br>maori society and<br>you can get by without them but i've<br>found<br>doing those papers has been so<br>applicable to everything that we've done<br>in the course so far so yeah awesome<br>ian<br>thank you so much<br>all right so uh<br>we'll talk a little bit about and i'll<br>come closer because um with masks and<br>glasses things are out of focus if i<br>stand too far back right there yeah all<br>right you okay i'm all i'm all right<br>yeah i've got my zimmer frame i'll be<br>fine okay um i'll tell you a little bit<br>about the curriculum um subjects because<br>one of the key things to consider for<br>secondary is what subjects will you<br>teach at<br>we do recommend that you have three<br>teaching subjects in mind<br>and you do need to have met<br>prerequisites for each of those subjects<br>and they are listed in this brochure<br>here and i can see some of you have that<br>and if you do wish to talk about your<br>particular case i'll happily have a<br>quick conversation with you<br>after this but it is very important that<br>you do have those prerequisites to be<br>allowed entry into the<br>program the one thing i would like to<br>explain is that<br>you'll see there are columns there that<br>say a required co-requisite and a<br>recommended co-requisite that's a very<br>strong recommendation so one example of<br>that<br>would be if you wish to teach english as<br>a learning area that you also do<br>specialist english and that will give<br>you enough experience and some skills to<br>teach right through from year 9 right<br>through to year 13 in that particular<br>subject area but do have a close look at<br>that um i will also clarify on the slide<br>what was meant by a body of paper so i<br>could ask that question a lot a body is<br>a collection so at least one paper<br>at 100 level at least one paper 201 at<br>300. that's really what that means um<br>and<br>finally we'll just clarify a little<br>points about terminology<br>um<br>we talk about learning areas<br>and the reason for that is because<br>that's what it says in the new zealand<br>curriculum okay there are seven learning<br>areas and they're sort of very broad if<br>you like one is english learning<br>languages science<br>social sciences technology physical<br>education and health<br>and what's the other one have i got them<br>all math and mathematics and statistics<br>thank you it's cause we are the founders<br>we are the founders where everything<br>so um we do uh recommend that you go<br>across maximum of two learning areas<br>and you can see but with the examples<br>there how it might be possible to<br>structure your three teaching subjects<br>with that but um it's probably more<br>important that you think about your own<br>particular situation and come and have a<br>chat if you've got any concerns<br>and for those people on the live stream<br>that might sound really complicated but<br>if you go onto the website it runs you<br>through that<br>well so when they talk about three<br>teaching subjects it's not three<br>different teaching subjects like<br>i.t and computers and english that could<br>be within the same learning area<br>okay so um melissa bell is our academic<br>manager and<br>she it's a really important role in the<br>university and she's going to<br>she says it's a bit of a dry topic that<br>i've given her<br>but she carries it well<br>thank you naomi um<br>my name is melissa bell<br>and i just want to say that the others<br>may say they're passionate educators but<br>i'm so passionate i managed to be born<br>to two parents who are educators i<br>married a teacher and my firstborn child<br>is doing the masters at this point in<br>fact my mum is one of eleven and eight<br>of them are teachers you should see our<br>christmases that wild right um this is<br>this is uh<br>we've had the nice information so we're<br>feeling inspired now we've got to get<br>your applications in so there's going to<br>be quite a few wee nuggets and hints<br>here you've already had a few about<br>preparing for the interview<br>so this is a restricted program<br>and<br>we do limit numbers because<br>as you've heard from students we really<br>believe that the pastoral care week of<br>our students is essential to the program<br>so the numbers are limited<br>they close the program applications<br>close on the 31st of july<br>now we could potentially consider a late<br>application<br>after that date but there is no<br>guarantee<br>so my curriculum area is history and we<br>get a lot of history applicants<br>if you want to be considered<br>get your application in early there are<br>some subject areas that we will still<br>seek because they're harder to staff<br>so there are more roles and we we really<br>need to um train more teachers in those<br>areas so please please get it in early<br>we try and turn this around really<br>quickly too<br>so when i say getting your application<br>in that means your full application<br>so um choose your referees carefully and<br>harass them and make sure they come in<br>because last year we had about three<br>masters students who were the first to<br>apply and their referee reports just<br>didn't come and we cannot interview you<br>until we've got those in<br>everyone is interviewed for this program<br>so we will contact probably me will<br>contact you and call you in for an<br>interview and can you please prioritize<br>that so you know last year we had people<br>who said<br>oh i've got a babysitting job that day<br>if you can kind of clear those<br>commitments that would be great um we<br>put together a panel and so you will<br>always be interviewed by two people<br>one of them will be one of us but the<br>other person's likely to be a school<br>principal or someone from an early<br>childhood setting someone from school<br>they've taken time off to interview you<br>it's really embarrassing too when you<br>don't turn up so<br>we do mass interviewing for primary and<br>secondary on a saturday<br>and it's quite cool because you come in<br>and you come into the college staff room<br>um and we'll call you for interviews but<br>you kind of get to meet a lot of the<br>other people can you remember doing that<br>was that cool we thought that was cool<br>um the sad news is that we have a<br>requirement to test you on that day also<br>so you will be sitting a literacy test<br>and a numeracy test<br>what we normally do is if your<br>interviews in the morning we'll put<br>those tests on in the afternoon<br>if you do not pass them there's a chance<br>to reset them<br>even if you have a phd in english<br>we have to give you this english test<br>which is probably around yeah eight nine<br>level english it's a little bit<br>embarrassing but um it's just something<br>we've got to do<br>please know if you want to take a place<br>it's great if you can turn that round if<br>you don't want to take a place let us<br>know because we'd love to give it to the<br>what do we look for we we look kind of<br>for a real balance of things first of<br>all we want um someone who has a good<br>academic profile so you normally need a<br>b grade average for your subject major<br>as a minimum<br>and there may be some room for<br>discretion around that but but that's<br>what we're really looking at for your<br>application<br>we want to to see that you've done<br>something that connects you to working<br>with young people<br>so that might be um tutoring<br>it could be that you've coached a sports<br>team that you're involved in church<br>groups<br>we also look for a suitability to be a<br>children's worker we have a very unusual<br>question we have to ask at the end which<br>is just a safety one about your<br>suitability<br>for working with young people<br>and we also look at your secondary<br>subjects if you're a secondary person<br>we're going to ask you in your interview<br>about your ability to go out of town for<br>a placement and we'll probably um ask<br>you where you might be um willing to go<br>but you know teachers um need more than<br>you know just a good academic background<br>they need sparkly personalities they<br>need to be able to connect with people<br>and they need to be able to engage with<br>a really diverse range of people they<br>need to be good communicators<br>and i always say we can help you learn<br>to teach but we can't teach you to be<br>charismatic<br>so you know don't i know it's hard in an<br>interview because it's so awkward and<br>formal but we really want to let um your<br>personality through so as much as<br>possible just try and relax um into the<br>interview<br>um some people find it really hard to<br>talk about themselves um positively<br>because we're quite humble as kiwis um<br>but this is your time to put that aside<br>and really be proud of the things that<br>you would bring um to this profession<br>um you had some excellent advice from<br>molly about maori 110<br>and 102 was that yep um i also for those<br>of you who are looking at primary can i<br>do a real plug if you have got<br>a little bit of space and semester two<br>please consider a new zealand history<br>paper we have a very exciting new<br>aotearoa histories curriculum which is<br>coming into schools from next year<br>onwards<br>and schools will be looking to graduates<br>to really lead some of this<br>this is my area and i'm doing work with<br>primary schools and many are very<br>nervous about it so it's another thing<br>that would really strengthen your<br>application<br>try and get into a school or an early<br>childhood setting for a visit if you can<br>if you manage that we're going to ask<br>you lots<br>about that experience and what you<br>noticed in the interview<br>the other thing i would say is<br>keep an eye on e-vision all the alerts<br>go through e-vision so if you are new to<br>otago just um either sync the mailboxes<br>so it's coming through but please check<br>on that and just be ready for some<br>communication through that source</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
