Since the 1980s, they have experienced unprecedented growth in participation and visibility, challenging our ideas about what sport is, and how it has been used as a tool for public policy across physical health, well¬being, and community and civic engagement.<br><br>The talk will go from the beaches of California where Professor Wheaton studied identity and exclusion amongst ‘Black’ surfers, to the streets of Paris where parkour emerged. It will end at the Tokyo Olympics where surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing made their Olympic debut.<br><br>Through this Professor Wheaton will discuss the sociology of sport, and how it has become central to understanding contemporary society and cultural change.<br><br>In the words of New Times writer Martin Jacques (1997), ‘Sport has become a symbol for our changing society, defining the nature of our new times.’<br><br> <br><br>About Professor Belinda Wheaton:<br><br>Belinda is cultural sociologist in Te Huataki Waiora School of Health teaching across Sport Development and Coaching and Community Health.

i<br>am and where i'm from<br>but these will emerge through my talk<br>however<br>i was born in fulham in london where i<br>lived until i left school<br>that's me with the platte<br>i came to arturoa in 2015<br>to work in sport and leisure studies<br>here at wakato<br>i made the journey<br>with my family<br>and we made fangaroa raglan<br>our new home<br>talk tonight is about a different kind<br>of journey<br>the development of my sociological<br>imagination<br>through this i hope to show what the<br>sociology of sport is<br>and how one new and peripheral area<br>lifestyle sports emerged<br>took hold and became something central<br>to understanding both sport culture<br>the sociological imagination is a<br>concept that was coined by sea wright<br>mills back in the mid 20th century but<br>still has resonance today<br>at that time society was understood as<br>social systems<br>but wright mills argued for the need to<br>understand individual experiences<br>how our world views our products of both<br>the historical context in which they<br>exist<br>and our everyday environments<br>as he wrote<br>neither the life of an individual nor<br>the history of a society can be<br>understood without understanding both<br>this approach he argued allows us to<br>understand<br>that what seems like an individual's<br>private troubles are really social<br>issues<br>and to expose the powerful groups that<br>control our institutions<br>revealing social injustices and<br>therefore enabling us to create social<br>change<br>while wright mills ideas were considered<br>revolutionary and challenging to many at<br>the time they remain central to<br>sociological practice<br>he also saw social science as the<br>practice of a craft<br>and his notes on intellectual<br>craftsmanship outline the importance of<br>explaining how we go about our craft<br>starting from a personal statement about<br>our own biography<br>so essentially the sociological<br>imagination is the critical ability to<br>develop understanding of heroin of how<br>our lives our biography<br>unfolds within a broader historical and<br>social context<br>it requires us to develop the capacity<br>to shift from one perspective to the<br>next<br>to separate ourselves from the<br>familiarity of our own personal<br>circumstances beliefs and traditions<br>and to identify and question various<br>aspects of ourselves and of society<br>so my talk tonight will show how my<br>developing sociological imagination<br>led me to identify the social<br>significance of informal and lifestyle<br>sport<br>and why my interest has been sustained<br>but first as right mills advised i need<br>to tell you a bit about me<br>as qualitative researchers now widely<br>recognize beneath every project is a<br>hidden and personal history which the<br>researcher must reveal<br>so my starting point is my childhood<br>experiences<br>my mum<br>was born in prague<br>when it was still part of the<br>austro-hungarian empire<br>she came to england as a child a refugee<br>by the time she was an adult she spoke<br>three languages fluently<br>and her close family were dispersed<br>my dad was born in a working class<br>family in london's notorious east end<br>despite leaving school at 14 over time<br>he managed to get an education<br>he became an electronics engineer<br>working with the research group in the<br>physics department of imperial college<br>london<br>and then started an environmental<br>science instrumentation company<br>my dad was therefore really keen for me<br>to have the privilege of a good<br>education and to study stem subjects<br>so i did physics and chemistry<br>which as it turned out i had little<br>my parents shared a love of the outdoors<br>my mom having spent a lot of her<br>childhood in the austrian alps and my<br>dad developed ping a passion for<br>climbing<br>in the hills of snowdonia<br>so despite growing up in the city<br>my childhood involved many adventures<br>including skiing in the alps<br>and sailing on the estuaries of england<br>i never became a climber much to my<br>dad's disappointment as i was terrified<br>of heights<br>but skiing became my passion<br>which i pursued as a competitive sport<br>across the european alps<br>i was then drawn back to the sea<br>learning to windsurf in my 20s<br>and becoming a windsurfing instructor<br>where i met my partner stuart there on<br>the middle slide<br>through windsurfing we got to travel<br>extensively and the ocean became my new<br>home<br>in my early twenties<br>after these years immersed in the<br>sporting world and working in the sport<br>and fitness industry<br>i decided to go to university to study<br>the relatively new degree of sports<br>science<br>i chose to study in brighton well<br>clearly because it was on the sea<br>in those days my degree title raised a<br>few eyebrows including from my mom who<br>although she'd never been to university<br>was clearly concerned that studying<br>sport was not a serious enterprise<br>but as i quickly learned this was not<br>going to be an easy option<br>i had to take first year classes in<br>anatomy physiology psychology<br>motor learning biomechanics and the<br>history and philosophy of sport<br>our research methods classes span from<br>experimental methods and statistics to<br>qualitative methodologies<br>like many multi-disciplinary degrees<br>emerging at that time we had challenging<br>debates about methodology epistemology<br>it wasn't long before the socio-cultural<br>areas captivated me particularly of<br>course in gender issues in sport<br>i learnt how historically sport had been<br>closely identified with men and<br>masculinity<br>recognizing sports significance as a<br>site of<br>gender regulation the feminist movement<br>was challenging this situation<br>the 1980s was a time of rapid change<br>with increasing opportunities for women<br>and girls across sport and physical<br>education<br>this was a key time in my own feminist<br>awakening and also helped me to make<br>sense of my own experiences of sport and<br>pee at school<br>despite being a sporty child who enjoyed<br>team games school sport was considered<br>very uncool by my teenage friends<br>and the uniforms were quite horrific and<br>so like my friends i avoided any<br>after completing my honours thesis i<br>headed to goldsmiths college london to<br>start my postgraduate training in the<br>sociology department<br>many of my lecturers were academic<br>superstars and their classes were just<br>quite terrifying<br>i found it hard to understand the<br>questions my fellow students were asking<br>let alone understand their debates<br>but i did come away with a better<br>understanding of what sociology was and<br>i set off to brighton with a doctoral<br>scholarship from the economic and social<br>research council esrc<br>to study in the sport and leisure<br>cultures group under the experienced<br>mentorship of alan tomlinson<br>in the words of professor jim mckay some<br>years later this group at the university<br>of brighton has become arguably the<br>leading place in the world for the study<br>of sport and leisure cultures<br>whereas sports sociology at that time<br>was focused on professional sport<br>cultures and in the us particularly on<br>college sport the interests of this<br>group were in the intersections of sport<br>leisure the media and everyday life<br>i wanted to understand the ways in which<br>sport culture was being impacted by the<br>wider societal shifts being documented<br>documented in what frederick jameson<br>called like capitalism<br>such as the fragmentation of identity<br>and emergence of new forms of<br>consumption in the words of new times<br>commentator martin jacks a few years<br>later<br>sport has become a symbol for our<br>changing society defining the nature of<br>our new times<br>sport he argued was interacting with and<br>being driven by some of the most<br>fundamental cultural shifts of our times<br>the new aspirations of women body and<br>fitness fashion leisure and prosperity<br>sport is surfing all these trends and in<br>so my research focused on one new<br>alternative sport windsurfing exploring<br>the meaning of the activity and its<br>associated social world for recreational<br>participants<br>windsurfing seemed to be different from<br>many of the institutionalized and<br>particularly competitive team-based<br>sports i'd experienced through school<br>and beyond<br>however my emerging sociological<br>imagination had shown me that to<br>understand the meaning of sport required<br>an awareness<br>of the wider context in which lifestyle<br>choices are made<br>particularly the impact of factors such<br>as social class gender<br>sexuality and ethnicity<br>my research therefore explored how<br>identities particularly gendered ones<br>when starting my phd<br>back in the 90s i was one of only a<br>handful of scholars worldwide interested<br>in what was being called alternative or<br>extreme sports<br>however research was starting to emerge<br>especially in the usa<br>initially with becky beale's research on<br>skateboarding<br>lifestyle sport is a concept i developed<br>some years later to help conceptualize<br>the experiences of participants in these<br>mostly individualized alternative sports<br>that had either emerged since the 1960s<br>or like surfing were older but had taken<br>a new meaning or focus<br>these activities presented a potential<br>challenge to traditional ways of seeing<br>doing and understanding sport<br>while there were differences between<br>them they shared a common<br>counter-cultural heritage<br>participants saw their cultures as<br>different to the rule bound regulated<br>institutionalized sport<br>they often rejected the label sport<br>itself seeing their activities as part<br>of a lifestyle project<br>through which the individual's social<br>self and identity was constructed also<br>informing consumption in other areas<br>such as fashion and music as well as<br>their politics<br>lifestyle sports have experienced<br>unprecedented growth both in<br>participation and in their visibility<br>evolving in a time of expanding media<br>and global communications<br>corporate influence across the leisure<br>industries and a growing affluent youth<br>demographic<br>lifestyle sport has spread around the<br>world far faster than most established<br>sports<br>they became the focus of numerous<br>television shows and films<br>and a lucrative industry around their<br>commodities and experiences from boards<br>and clothing to tourism<br>the allure and excitement has been<br>appropriated to sell every kind of<br>the media's appetite for these sports<br>was exemplified by the success of espn's<br>x games<br>which by 2003 less than 10 years after<br>its inauguration had a global audience<br>of 50 million<br>conversely during this time the youth<br>audience for the olympics was was<br>steadily declining<br>and i'll come back to this later in my<br>talk<br>and television contracts for the north<br>american big three american football<br>baseball and basketball<br>had lost the american network billions<br>these sports clearly had a significance<br>beyond their relatively no low numbers<br>by the 21st century research on action<br>and lifestyle sport have proliferated<br>including across different sports and<br>places their gender politics spatial<br>politics<br>and processes of commercialization and<br>professionalization<br>it was also clear that activities that<br>were once on the margins and the domain<br>of young white men were changing with<br>increasing participation across gender<br>they were also beginning to attract<br>detention in policy circles<br>in 2005 with a group of colleagues at<br>brighton we were commissioned to write a<br>report for sport england<br>to explore how lifestyle sport could be<br>used in national sport policies<br>while our research became widely<br>referred to<br>it was another 10 years or more before<br>sport england acted on any of the<br>findings<br>my own research turned to explore the<br>more marginal or subordinated<br>experiences and different sports<br>was lifestyle sports solely the<br>lifestyle choice of a privileged western<br>play world<br>and did they provide cultural spaces<br>where the dominant ideologies of sport<br>were challenged<br>i also wanted to tease out the ways in<br>which discourses about these sports such<br>as risk freedom self-reliance youth<br>empowerment<br>and environmental sensibilities<br>were circulated by medias and<br>corporations<br>between 2007 and 2013 i was involved in<br>a range of projects related to these<br>questions and that became the focus of<br>this book published at the end of 2013<br>and<br>translated by a japanese scholar in 2019<br>so i'm just going to highlight three of<br>these projects<br>first however<br>as right mills advises i need to return<br>to my own biography<br>as he stated you must learn to use your<br>life experiences in your intellectual<br>work<br>continually to examine and interpret it<br>from my initial interest in windsurfing<br>lifestyle sport is something that is<br>also a central part of my own life<br>i've been a participant in many<br>activities on the sea and in the<br>mountains and most recently i've been<br>my involvement has ranged from beginner<br>to international competitor and my<br>embodied experiences invoked excitement<br>terror pleasure and pain at times all in<br>the same day<br>i've also had involvement with local and<br>national sporting organizations run<br>events worked in the action sport<br>industry and as a writer for magazines<br>my two children's involvements across<br>many lifestyle and traditional sports<br>has also provided a different lens<br>so these multiple perspectives and ever<br>changing experiences through my life<br>course have given me a longitudinal<br>perspective<br>allowing me to reflect on continuity and<br>change<br>and the complexities of intersectional<br>identities and the differences between<br>in 2007 i was in durban south africa<br>visiting surfers not street kids as<br>surfing for development initiative<br>which led to a project focused on a<br>durban skatepark<br>this research was central in helping to<br>unpack assumptions about lifestyle<br>sports as exclusively privileged white<br>and male spaces and whether in other<br>cultural contexts it was possible to<br>re-envisage them<br>a group of mostly zulu streets living on<br>durban seafront had learned to<br>skateboard at this local park because<br>the man who ran it took them under his<br>wing<br>loaning them boards and shoes<br>it became a safe space for them and one<br>that led some of the kids away from glue<br>sniffing and back to school<br>skateboarding appealed because it was<br>free there were no rules time<br>constraints or adults such as coaches<br>i was also struck that in contrast to<br>most spaces i visited in durban which<br>were highly delineated by ethnic groups<br>the so-called whites colored and blacks<br>the skatepark was much more<br>heterogeneous<br>and i was fascinated to discover that<br>one of the appealing qualities about<br>skateboarding in durban was its newness<br>skaters said that unlike sports like<br>rugby and football it was not associated<br>with particular<br>ethnic groups<br>this project fostered my interest in<br>exploring lifestyle sports ability to<br>engage non-privileged youth and also<br>since the 1950s<br>the quintessential image of the surfing<br>body has been of a young male tanned<br>with sun blonde bleached blonde hair<br>fueled by the hollywood beach movies and<br>the beach boys music in the usa this<br>image became so iconic<br>he became the face of california<br>yet surfing did not originate in<br>california<br>although origin history is a complex<br>polynesia is widely recognized as<br>surfing's home<br>after hawaii's colonization white north<br>americans and australians appropriated<br>and redefined the activity in the middle<br>part of the 20th century<br>yet the colonisation and racialization<br>of surfing<br>had received surprisingly little<br>academic attention<br>this absence fueled my research<br>examining the formative and contemporary<br>experiences of a small group of<br>african-american surfers in los angeles<br>my research showed the range of<br>difficulties or constraints that many of<br>these black surfers had faced including<br>experiences of racism and exclusion<br>these range from stereotypes such as<br>blacks don't swim<br>to historically rooted perceptions of<br>outdoor spaces as white and that<br>visiting nature was not part of their<br>culture<br>they recounted how their communities<br>were still fearful of water and beaches<br>they said stemming from past histories<br>of the slave sea voyagers from africa<br>and how during the jim crow area era<br>nature was a place of fear associated<br>this research provides a vivid<br>illustration of the continued<br>racialization of public space<br>as research on outdoor recreation<br>amongst minority ethnic groups in the<br>usa has found invisible lines of<br>segregation continue to exist<br>state resources from beaches to<br>mountains remain the domain of white<br>privileged communities even when they<br>surfing had also become an arena through<br>which to confront and attempt to change<br>these surfers individual and collective<br>exclusion<br>it was repeatedly described as political<br>now what this men and the time types of<br>politics they engaged in varied<br>for some it was just the freedom to just<br>be in white space<br>however others advocated most<br>transformative actions which they<br>believe would eventually lead to social<br>change<br>as my former colleague sport and race<br>scholar ben carrington outlines<br>sport has been seen as a political<br>a space for transcendence removed from<br>the everyday concerns of power<br>inequality and ideology<br>carrington's work shows how sport has<br>had an important influence<br>both on black politics and on how<br>african diasporic people have viewed<br>themselves and how these communities<br>have come to be viewed<br>likewise the beach has often been<br>regarded as a liminal free fun space<br>rather than recognized to be an<br>important site where racial formations<br>so for many surfers in my research both<br>the beach and surfing were sites of<br>inequality and regulation<br>the black surfing association was formed<br>in the 1970s to create solidarity<br>their activities have expanded including<br>publishing histories of black surfers<br>intervening in the mass and niche media<br>to challenge stereotypes and taking over<br>beach space<br>as one of the interviewees said<br>i believe that we are engaged in a civil<br>rights struggle at the beach<br>and the and another<br>the black surfing association is simply<br>a chapter in a much larger story about<br>wave riding as it relates to the african<br>diaspora<br>and its black people's relationship to<br>here we see how political practices that<br>extends beyond the personal level can<br>develop through sport<br>allowing some of these black surfers to<br>develop a critical consciousness that<br>transcends the sports context<br>as right mills advised what seems as<br>personal troubles are rarely such<br>to understand such inequalities requires<br>for individual experience to be placed<br>in their broader historical and cultural<br>context<br>according to its founders<br>parkour is the art of moving fluidly<br>from one part of the environment to<br>another<br>it does not have a set of rules and it<br>does not fit existing categories being<br>described as a sport an art and a<br>discipline<br>parkour emerged from the multi-racial<br>paris suburbs of least in the 1980s<br>but it was largely underground till the<br>late 90s when media across many nations<br>were documenting parkour's emergence<br>since then it has spread rapidly through<br>informal networks and sites such as<br>youtube<br>particularly amongst young urban<br>populations globally<br>my research emerged from involvement in<br>a community funded and leds youth<br>project in sussex in 2008.<br>the organization wanted to provide a<br>parkour training area for local teenage<br>widespread misinformation particularly<br>the media's depiction of parkour as a<br>dangerous and high risk activity<br>had created many challenges as one sport<br>development officer i interviewed put it<br>kids in hoodies on street corners you<br>know you get the same old analogies<br>you're just teaching the cat burglars of<br>as police officers confirmed<br>that despite this there was little<br>evidence of disruption but the kids were<br>so we wanted to understand the activity<br>its perceived social value and the<br>impacts of the way parkour was<br>increasingly becoming institutionalized<br>as a formal sport<br>we examined a range of youth policy<br>initiatives and interventions<br>across which there was a belief that<br>through parkour individuals learnt to<br>see their relationships to themselves to<br>others and their environments<br>differently<br>it had engaged groups who considered<br>themselves unsporty or disliked pe and<br>team games<br>and the ethos of non-competitiveness<br>creativity support and inclusivity<br>helped to appeal to diverse groups<br>across ages genders and physical<br>abilities<br>project led me to working with<br>performance parkour an organization<br>based in theatre and community dance and<br>involved with some fascinating projects<br>they were concerned that if parkour<br>became formally institutionalized as a<br>sport it would limit its appeal and<br>the belief that traditional sport has<br>the capacity to act as a panacea for the<br>social concerns of the day from tackling<br>crime to obesity is long-standing<br>yet research evidence to back this up is<br>surprisingly scarce<br>nonetheless from the late 1990s sport<br>became central to the british<br>government's social inclusion and health<br>agendas<br>with growing concerns about young people<br>living increasingly bubble wrapped and<br>sedentary lives and questions about<br>traditional sports capacity to deliver<br>public policy outcomes<br>activities like parkour were<br>as an australian government commissioned<br>report on the future of australian sport<br>recognized<br>most team sports were in decline<br>whereas the growth of individualistic<br>and lifestyle sports was one of the<br>important megatrends of the 21st century<br>sportscape<br>however as our report to support england<br>back in 2005 had highlighted<br>informal activities presented many<br>challenges for policymakers<br>and there was a need to understand and<br>recognize their different cultures and<br>governance structures<br>many of which<br>lacked having clubs or organizations<br>so with funding from the economic and<br>social research council i led a team to<br>develop an international network to<br>explore these issues<br>and innovative and inclusive approaches<br>to enhancing physically active<br>lifestyles we brought together academics<br>policy makers educationalists and<br>practitioners and held five seminars<br>spanning policy regulation pe and<br>we highlighted that alongside the<br>language of social benefits ideas about<br>active citizenship and<br>self-responsibility were becoming a<br>attitudes to the provision of lifestyle<br>sports were shifting<br>rather than participants being perceived<br>as anti-social and deviant they were<br>being embraced as creative<br>entrepreneurial neo-liberal citizens<br>however this raised social justice<br>concerns as being a good and healthy<br>citizen was being equated with<br>individual lifestyle choices<br>masking forms of inequality and of<br>it was frustrating and gratifying<br>that the points we had raised back in<br>2005 were finally recognised in the new<br>sports strategy for england launched in<br>2015<br>where lifestyle informal and<br>non-competitive sport was seen as key in<br>order to tackle high levels of<br>inactivity and flatlining sport<br>participation<br>similarly a report sport england<br>commissioned on outdoor participation<br>trends i advised on reported a shift<br>towards taking part for more functional<br>or lifestyle reasons<br>claiming that sixty percent of adults<br>indicate they're not more active because<br>they just don't like sports and they<br>this situation finds parallel in other<br>countries including new zealand where<br>national sport policymakers<br>often wedded to particular sports<br>are recognising the importance of more<br>as the covid pandemic<br>vividly illustrated informal sports<br>activities were central ways for people<br>to cope during the times of restriction<br>and as some of my more recent research<br>has shown continue to provide widespread<br>individual and community<br>in 2010<br>my brighton colleagues tomlinson and<br>sugden were editing a book on the london<br>i have been fascinated by the olympics<br>since taking a class as an undergraduate<br>learning how politics have been<br>intertwined in the games from boycotts<br>propaganda and protests<br>to the ways women had had to fight for<br>space and recognition<br>in recent times with multiple scandals<br>the continuing relevance of the olympics<br>was being questioned by scholars and<br>publics alike<br>therefore as this book advised our task<br>was to look behind the spectacle and<br>these magical moments of human<br>accomplishment<br>to a terror interrogate the utopian<br>projections of olympism and the broken<br>promises<br>holly thorpe now my colleague was<br>visiting our research center<br>with her expertise on snowboarding we<br>collaborated to explore the role and<br>impact of action sports such as<br>snowboarding bmx and windsurfing on the<br>olympics<br>this was to be the beginning of a<br>10-year collaboration<br>our research showed that younger olympic<br>television viewers have been declining<br>for decades<br>the ioc had tried to attract younger<br>audiences by incorporating action sports<br>despite its controversial inclusion in<br>the 1998 winter olympics snowboarding<br>was credited with a 48 increase in 18 to<br>24 year old viewers at the<br>2010 games<br>however the audience for the summer<br>games continue to fall particularly in<br>key consumer markets such as the us<br>the median age of the us tv audience for<br>the 2016 rio games was 53<br>and between london and rio there was a<br>30 percent drop in the 18 to 34 htv<br>viewers<br>the arrival of the new president back in<br>2013<br>and the introduction of his agenda 2020<br>strategy with its three key pillars<br>credibility sustainability and youth<br>accelerated the modernizing process<br>agenda 2020 was the ioc's effort to<br>appear to become more relevant in a<br>shortly afterwards 2014 i was invited to<br>lausanne by the head of summer sports<br>programs<br>to discuss how new action sports might<br>help address youth relevance<br>shortly after that i came to wakato to<br>join sport and leisure studies<br>the group had gained an international<br>reputation for its critical sports<br>scholarship through the works of<br>scholars such as doug boov tony bruce<br>richard pringle bob reinhart<br>and action and lifestyle sports was a<br>research focus for several current staff<br>including holly<br>bob lisa hunter rebecca olive mike brown<br>early in 2015 holly and i secured an ioc<br>advanced research program grant to<br>develop our research on the ifc's<br>attempt to bring new action sports under<br>soon after we started the ioc and tokyo<br>organizing committees announced they had<br>shortlisted five new sports including<br>skateboarding surfing and sport climbing<br>for inclusion in the tokyo games<br>in 2016 we were invited back to lausanne<br>to present our emerging research to the<br>ioc executive board to help in their<br>decision to ratify inclusion of these<br>at the end of last year we published our<br>monograph based on this research from<br>the development of the relationship<br>between action sports and the olympics<br>through to the postponed tokyo games in<br>2021<br>our research shows the complex struggles<br>and workings of power within the olympic<br>movement and also in these action sports<br>cultures and industries<br>our focus ranges from gender equity and<br>diversity to the politics of sport<br>governance<br>and the national differences in the<br>professionalisation of these<br>we used a longitudinal and multi-method<br>approach<br>to explore how each different action<br>sport their industries and participants<br>responded to olympic inclusion<br>both initially and over the following<br>five years<br>and the roles and motivations of the<br>different power brokers including the<br>ioc the media and the action sport<br>industries<br>we also organized two symposia here in<br>ottaroa which helped to understand the<br>national policy and funding landscape<br>and struggles for our athletes and<br>for many sports fans the addition of<br>action sports raises questions about<br>however ideas about what is a legitimate<br>sport will continue to shift over the<br>coming years as the ioc stakes its claim<br>in an increasingly competitive sport and<br>leisure market<br>with the survival of the game so<br>dependent on viewers and sponsorship<br>dollars the ioc will only fight harder<br>to stay relevant to the next generation<br>this is also evident in the inclusion of<br>kite foiling and breakdancing in the<br>paris 2024 games<br>and the interest that the io take ioc<br>are taking in parkour and esports<br>further pushing boundaries of what sport<br>is in the 21st century despite the<br>challenge this presents for their<br>traditional core audiences and<br>stakeholders<br>ultimately the complex and dynamic<br>relationship between action sports and<br>the olympic games<br>has been a revealing case for analyzing<br>and interpreting the broken promises as<br>well as the utopian projections of<br>olympism that sugden and tomlinson<br>called for<br>our research also shows in wright<br>mills's words<br>that to understand society and help<br>create social change we need to expose<br>how powerful and undemograph<br>undemocratic groups like the ioc<br>as my talk has shown<br>my sociological imagination led me to<br>focus on informal and lifestyle sport<br>but through this my research went in<br>many different directions just some of<br>which i've shown you today<br>and these continue in my ongoing work<br>such as my research looking at blue<br>space and human ocean well-being in<br>otaroa<br>wright mills suggested that stimulating<br>the so<br>sociological imagination involves a<br>sense of playfulness<br>but also a truly fierce drive to make<br>sense of the world<br>i still feel this sense of excitement<br>and also of passing on to my students<br>i remember how thrilled i was early in<br>my career when one undergraduate who had<br>really struggled in understanding the<br>point of my class came bursting into my<br>office<br>belinda i get it now oh my god i am<br>never going to see the world in the same<br>being in arturoa for over seven years i<br>have experienced many different things<br>particularly through learning about<br>maturanga maori<br>i'm very grateful to all the colleagues<br>students and research participants who<br>have generously shared their knowledge<br>and from whom i've learned so much<br>particularly in understanding<br>my own positionality and place in the<br>world<br>through these different perspectives i<br>will continue to develop my own<br>there is a maori proverb i'm sure you're<br>familiar with that i feel speaks to my<br>journey well and that wright mills<br>probably would have liked as well<br>what is the most important thing in the<br>world it is the people it is the people<br>there are<br>many people i would like to acknowledge<br>as part of this journey<br>both near and far but i'm just going to<br>mention a few of them<br>in my first job in london professor<br>jennifer hargraves in the top right in<br>the middle<br>she was an inspirational role model<br>particularly in standing up for equity<br>and social justice both in her ground<br>breaking feminist research on sport and<br>physical culture and in the workplace<br>jenny showed me what a commitment to<br>feminism looks like and that it's rarely<br>the easy path<br>she also became my academic mom<br>feeding me amazing food and red wine in<br>at the university of brighton my<br>colleagues in sport and leisure cultures<br>they provided a unique working<br>environment<br>a collectivity infused with intellectual<br>passion and rigor and a desire to make a<br>difference<br>my long-standing feminist collective<br>louise jane and becky we met as phd<br>students but have remained colleagues<br>and friends<br>they have been my rock for many years<br>then came my journey to artaroa thank<br>you<br>to all of those who encouraged me to<br>come and made me welcome<br>especially tony bruce who couldn't be<br>here tonight but she let us<br>let us live in her house<br>and to all of those i've met and worked<br>with from my initial home in sport and<br>leisure studies then tiaranga the school<br>of human development and movement<br>studies and now health<br>however a particularly heartfelt thank<br>you to my research collaborators here in<br>artaroa<br>holly beck lizette jordan mark lisa<br>hunter<br>robin cans<br>rob<br>iski georgina<br>i also want to mention all of those i<br>work with on the<br>core in 2020 to wai manawa center for<br>fresh water research<br>especially james brassington tim manukau<br>and persephone and john tyrell in the<br>research office<br>i love the choreo and<br>i've been fortunate to supervise some<br>fantastic phd students<br>from around the world those aren't my<br>phd students<br>uh and i've shared these journeys with<br>amazing women holly robin and lizette<br>and this has been a real highlight and i<br>have to just say that a huge bunch of<br>flowers arrive for me in the foyer from<br>my phd students each of which<br>have written some lovely words<br>and they're mostly<br>finally<br>thank you to everyone here today who has<br>joined me to celebrate this milestone<br>sadly this audience can't include many<br>important people in my life<br>both my parents passed away over the<br>last two years during the covert<br>pandemic<br>they were a huge source of support and<br>both were thrilled when i came a<br>professor<br>i'm not sure if i ever convinced my dad<br>of the value of social science but i'm<br>sure he would have enjoyed my talk<br>tonight<br>and he definitely developed his own<br>i'm very grateful to have my close<br>funnel<br>stuart<br>and our kids poppy and ollie here<br>tonight i hope you didn't bring cookie<br>stewart has been our rock<br>holding family light together<br>sometimes across continents<br>and through very challenging times<br>without your support i would not be here<br>today<br>you</p></main><footer
