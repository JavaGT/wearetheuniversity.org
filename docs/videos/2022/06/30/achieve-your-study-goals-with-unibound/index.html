mentors who help guide and<br>prepare pacific students for university<br>life starting unibound i was really<br>nervous but excited at the same time to<br>meet like new people i expected it to be<br>like really hard like a lot of work<br>but then once we got into it it was<br>really like<br>i don't know it just felt so<br>comfortable and like it wasn't like<br>stressing<br>because we got to like do like<br>dancing it wasn't just writing<br>and yeah i equally similar to sabrina<br>was nervous as a mentor because you come<br>in<br>being a student yourself but you are<br>giving it a capacity where you were once<br>in their shoes and it felt like over the<br>summer we had built this village for<br>these students as well as you know even<br>though we were mentors ourselves but we<br>were literally like their older sibling<br>helping them transition in such a<br>crucial time for them so yeah equally<br>nervous because you know we're coming<br>out of a pandemic still very much is but<br>being in person and doing this with our<br>own was humbling and<br>yeah exciting challenge for us an<br>opportunity i actually had separation<br>anxiety being away from my students but<br>it was really good to be in a pathway<br>which was out of my field and it was<br>really interesting to see pacific people<br>really passionate about say for example<br>health sciences and having a pacific<br>land on that was very humbling and you<br>know being outside of my faculty and<br>seeing kids who want to be future<br>neuroscientists and being future doctors<br>of our people was yeah that was really<br>exciting i was like whoa i didn't like<br>science in high school but it was really<br>humbling to see a different lens which<br>was nice so<br>yeah how did you find i found it<br>inspiring like um having mentors that<br>are like pacific islanders and they're<br>like topping their faculty and then<br>having them to um like talk to you it<br>was just touching because like it<br>motivates you to actually just work<br>harder<br>because just because you're pacific<br>islander doesn't mean like<br>you have to like degrade yourself in<br>there you know and yeah it just pushes<br>you to work more for yourself<br>yeah<br>i believe coming from a background where<br>everything was taught in class like we<br>learned a lot of commerce subjects and<br>most like lectures you're sending in<br>workshops whereas for the pacific<br>lecture we did it was hands-on<br>experience but as well as the theory<br>part so we got to learn more about<br>pacific history more in touch well it's<br>like melanesia yeah more melanesia and<br>then we got to do the practice was like<br>did we sign up for f45 class so<br>that was um i was like pretty sure like<br>was that in the contract that we signed<br>up for but it was really humbling to see<br>how<br>colonization played a big part in that<br>community and then seeing how dance has<br>evolved and how we can tell our story so<br>we're getting a workout as well as<br>getting um the theory part at the same<br>time which was awesome so i think um<br>i think being in the fale and um<br>doing our first academic course was<br>it's what<br>mostly brought us together<br>like dancing together and learning a new<br>culture was really different and new it<br>was cool like we didn't have just like<br>the same thing every day but it was good<br>to like<br>experience different<br>courses<br>it's awesome that the mentors had an<br>allocated slot um either in their day or<br>during the week to run mental workshops<br>so for my bulk<br>my group we i got the opportunity to<br>share everything i had learned and what<br>i studied so i did marketing as a major<br>in bachelor of commerce and then being<br>able to tailor that to our students in<br>regards to brand perception<br>was really vital because i know for sure<br>when i delivered that workshop for<br>these students i told them that how you<br>perceive yourself and how people<br>perceive you is really key because then<br>when you go out into the workforce<br>that's like your golden ticket and so<br>being a pacific person there's so many<br>layers and that you need to<br>obviously unravel to people and so how<br>you present yourself is so key and being<br>a pacific person is<br>yeah your greatest asset so yeah i was<br>really honoured to share this with my<br>bowl sports day was one of the best<br>memories throughout unibound<br>we got to interact with each other more<br>not only just in the fall like doing our<br>um academic courses but um also like<br>um interacting through like sports and<br>having fun and um we also got to<br>meet our um<br>student student associations um like for<br>example um cob so that's commerce or<br>pasifika<br>and um it was just um it was so helpful<br>for them to come out and talk to us so<br>like um because how it's our first year<br>and we get to like<br>you know join with them and it's a lot<br>of help yeah it was really good for the<br>students to get a taster of<br>opportunities abroad so we had 360<br>international come through and talk to<br>with our students and scholarships are<br>available i know with the borders slowly<br>opening up and restrictions are easing<br>our students are not restricted to stay<br>here um you know for their second year<br>they can consider going to like<br>somewhere in europe to study so that was<br>really cool<br>we also had campus life or campus care<br>come through<br>so it's really good that especially for<br>pacific students you know we manage a<br>lot of things you know family cultural<br>stuff and<br>on top of that they're studying so it's<br>really good for them to know that there<br>are health and well-being services<br>available for them so that when you know<br>going gets tough there's opportunities<br>for them to get extensions etc so that<br>team was awesome to have<br>um and then we also had<br>leadership through learning so it was<br>really good for the students as well<br>again to really understand their purpose<br>i know most of them probably came to uni<br>like oh i came to uni because my mom and<br>dad said i had to come but then it was<br>good for them to uncover like why they<br>want to come to uni and then kind of<br>unpacking from that like the how and the<br>what because that's what's going to help<br>them<br>stay in the degree and you know get kept<br>in the end so that was a really awesome<br>unleash yeah anish um alicia was fun<br>um we got to like<br>make things<br>um we did we also like um<br>we got into groups<br>um in in our own bowl and like we got to<br>like do robotic stuff<br>and it was really competitive and then<br>we were just one ball but<br>yeah<br>taking leadership like um<br>we had one person that had to like<br>introduce our robot and stuff but um<br>i think like it gave us confidence<br>and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
