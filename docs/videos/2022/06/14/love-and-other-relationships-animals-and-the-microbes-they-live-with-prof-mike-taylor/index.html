font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>for those of you who don't know me i am<br>alan rodrigo and i'm the head of the<br>school of biological sciences<br>and of course it's my great pleasure<br>tonight to officiate at this inaugural<br>professorial lecture by professor mike<br>taylor<br>those of you from sbs may have heard me<br>say quite frequently that biology is the<br>science of the 21st century<br>the world is obsessed with all things<br>biological from climate change<br>to life on other planets<br>to growing new crops<br>to diseases and yes pandemics<br>and with pandemics our obsession has<br>turned to things<br>microbiological<br>not just viruses although they feature<br>greatly in our psyche at present<br>but bacteria and fungi particularly<br>those that live with us<br>on us<br>and in us<br>by all accounts mike was a man ahead of<br>his time because he has been obsessed<br>with microbes for a very long time<br>his earliest publications date this<br>obsession to 2004 18 years ago<br>with a paper about microbes in sponges<br>and mike has never looked back since<br>now in the media in movies scientists<br>are often portrayed as lonely be<br>spectacled individuals pouring over test<br>tubes bunsen burners and microscopes<br>or more commonly in the case of<br>microbiologists<br>they are evil and maniacal<br>mike is not any of these<br>mike is in fact highly collaborative<br>collaborative with a large<br>an international network of colleagues<br>testimony to mike's collaborative spirit<br>is the strong international reputation<br>that he has built up mike is on the<br>board of the international society for<br>microbial ecology and he is the chair<br>for the 20th international symposium on<br>microbial ecology due to be held in<br>auckland in 2026<br>and for those of you who don't know<br>the international symposium on microbial<br>ecology is the conference in the field<br>presenting at this conference<br>is the equivalent<br>closer to home mike was also the<br>president of the new zealand<br>microbiological society until 2021 and<br>while this testifies to his standing in<br>the community his election to these<br>senior roles also testifies to mike's<br>collegiality and citizenship when i came<br>back to the university of auckland in<br>2020 i was delighted that mike was the<br>deputy head of research at the school of<br>biological sciences<br>being deputy head of research in 2020<br>unfortunately meant that mike had to<br>oversee<br>and evaluate the requests of essential<br>workers at sbs who wanted to have access<br>to our buildings during lockdown<br>you know mike of course so you know that<br>he did this job equally and<br>empathetically<br>most recently i asked mike to take on a<br>postgraduate advisor role and he did<br>something that surprised and delighted<br>me<br>he thanked me for inviting him to take<br>on this role and then said that he was<br>light on service and was in fact looking<br>for a role to he could take on<br>of course i immediately suggested he<br>consider the head of school role<br>mike's research is outstanding he has<br>appeared on thompson's reuters<br>international list of highly cited<br>researchers and has published more than<br>100 papers which have garnered more than<br>11 000 citations<br>the following two caught my eye because<br>they feature two of new zealand's iconic<br>species and because both had mike's phd<br>students as first authors that the 2022<br>paper by annie west and colleagues on<br>the gut microbiome of the takahe<br>and its implications for conservation<br>and the second published in 2018 with<br>david waite<br>and colleagues on the genomic analysis<br>of fecal microbiota of the kakapo<br>but of course mike's<br>research is far more varied than that<br>and now is probably the right time for<br>me to stop and hand over the stage to<br>mike so he can tell us about his work<br>mike<br>okay uh kia ora everybody um good<br>evening thanks very much for coming<br>along thanks alan for the very kind<br>introduction there and i'm sure i gave<br>you quite a firm answer on the future<br>ahead of school thing actually from what<br>yeah um yeah thanks so much for coming<br>along it's really humbling to see so<br>many uh friends family colleagues some<br>past and present lab members here so i<br>very much appreciate everyone coming out<br>especially on such a<br>diabolically unpredictable<br>i have to say it's quite uh intimidating<br>actually to be um<br>standing here giving my inaugural<br>lecture when i think back on some of the<br>um incredible inaugural lectures that<br>i've been to from some of my colleagues<br>here at sbs uh really some of my<br>academic heroes um<br>likes of uh rod dunbar anthony phillips<br>joe patrol jacqueline biggs sally poppet<br>among others and my apologies to the<br>ones that i i didn't mention here<br>but um yeah i<br>really feel like i have some uh big<br>shoes to pull tonight but if i can give<br>half as good a talk as some of those<br>ones i'll be very happy<br>okay as i guess it's kind of uh<br>customary in these lectures i'm going to<br>give a little bit of a a backstory to<br>how it got into science in the first<br>place<br>talk a little bit about my academic path<br>and how i came to be standing here in<br>front of you this evening<br>got lots of people to thank<br>um and then for sort of the second half<br>i guess i'm going to<br>talk about a couple of<br>research stories so take a slightly<br>deeper dive into a couple of the<br>different<br>so i guess this is where it<br>all started for me this is the uh house<br>i grew up in um in the beautiful<br>beachside town of hopi down in the<br>eastern bay of plenty<br>um<br>you<br>may have been there yourselves and if<br>not you may well have heard of it it's<br>often voted like the most popular uh<br>best beach in the country and um it<br>certainly made a complete beach snob out<br>of me nothing else really compares<br>our folks bought a quarter acre<br>beachfront section there in the early<br>1970s when real estate was cheap as<br>chips you certainly<br>wouldn't be buying that um these days<br>unless you've got a fair bit of money<br>but yeah this house was literally right<br>beachfront this is um<br>the view out from our place you can see<br>uh motohora whale island there and i<br>don't think you can see it on this<br>picture but somewhere lurking in the<br>background is uh fakadi white island and<br>we could see white island steaming away<br>at our lounge room window so it was<br>really a idyllic place to to grow up<br>uh this is the taylor family um this is<br>mum in the front um margaret and it's<br>great to see um<br>mum's cousins along here tonight so<br>thank you very much for coming along<br>um mum was a pharmacist<br>she stopped being a pharmacist when she<br>started having kids<br>but uh yeah certainly very involved in<br>the community at ohopi<br>uh dad at the back there's a hydrologist<br>a civil engineer worked for the bay of<br>plenty regional council just over the<br>hill in wakatani<br>and here's the uh three white-haired<br>taylor boys and i like this picture<br>because you can see at the back there<br>that's me i'm the youngest you can see i<br>actually had here at some point in my<br>life so<br>quite stoked about that and white here<br>for that matter<br>uh in front the middle brother uh bruce<br>he's a uh accomplished wine maker he's<br>the head wine maker for toho wines done<br>in uh melbourne doing really well for<br>himself<br>and this guy in the middle the older<br>brother um<br>a lot of you will know uh<br>my brother richard who's a highly<br>regarded marine ecologist up at this<br>okay so i think there was a certain<br>inevitability uh about me<br>studying animals and getting into<br>biology<br>um certainly from a very young age i was<br>keen to um meet the locals whenever we<br>went on<br>overseas trips we were very fortunate to<br>have some family trips to north<br>queensland<br>and um got to interact with a<br>of different animals there<br>and as you can see here um me wearing<br>full ppe as one should be when handling<br>a spiky little critter like a hedgehog i<br>for whatever reason had quite a thing<br>for hedgehogs when i was younger i don't<br>think i realized quite what nasty<br>destructive animals they were i thought<br>they were just cute<br>so i would um<br>put out milk for them each night and<br>watch them at the lounge room window and<br>dad and i used to actually put splotches<br>of white paint i shouldn't talk about<br>that it wasn't really ethically approved<br>or anything but<br>we would put splotches of white paint on<br>the hedgehog so we could work out which<br>ones came along each evening i think i<br>had about nine or ten in total<br>so certainly that love of animals was<br>there from a young age the outdoors as<br>well so we had various camping and<br>hiking holidays and things which are<br>great<br>i'm not in this picture because i think<br>i must have taken this one myself but um<br>i just wanted to mention my my grandad<br>there<br>bill taylor he lived to be almost 102<br>years old<br>got some promising genetics there and um<br>he he was really remarkable so<br>up until just a few months before um he<br>passed away he was like going for long<br>walks and we're talking several<br>kilometers there<br>he was traveling over to canada well<br>into his 90s to um visit my uncle and<br>his family and he'd get up early in the<br>morning and do yoga every morning so<br>quite uh<br>inspirational<br>so yeah<br>actually pretty keen on knowledge and<br>science from quite a young age as well<br>this is i think one of the very few<br>awards or prizes of one in my entire<br>life this was um<br>i picked when i was 12 years old<br>apparently<br>this was the violet briffo award an<br>environmental study<br>from the eastern bay of plenty branch of<br>the royal forest and bird society and<br>this was study of a stream the study of<br>a small bush stream in its catchment<br>this is actually<br>on the stream that flows down through a<br>scenic reserve and then passed a hopi<br>beach school<br>so<br>i dragged dad all through the the bush<br>reserve and we collected leaves and<br>things and i learned how to press leaves<br>and<br>presented a whole bunch of them in this<br>study which<br>if my memory serves me correct i think i<br>uh won a 25 book voucher which probably<br>wasn't the best hourly rate considering<br>um how much time i put into it but i was<br>i was pretty stoked at 12 year old to to<br>get a book voucher<br>okay so i i think probably due to uh<br>some of these amazing national parks we<br>would see in queensland and we had a<br>family trip to um north america when i<br>was six years old as well<br>my wife is hanging her head in shame at<br>the front there because she knows what's<br>coming next<br>apparently i wouldn't let false modesty<br>get in the way because i called it<br>michelson national park<br>uh this was in in the backyard of our<br>section in the hopi there's mike kenyon<br>there my mount michelson<br>so a bit of an egomaniac even back then<br>but i spent a lot of time making little<br>paths and<br>coming up with a whole range of<br>scientific literature here<br>so this was all put out by the michelson<br>national parks and wildlife service as<br>you can see there's<br>mammals of michaelson birds parks<br>michaelson etc and<br>um<br>i think i used to try and hock these off<br>to my parents at some exorbitant rate to<br>make a bit of money<br>so don't worry there was more michaelson<br>merchandise here<br>the uh<br>a<br>bookmark<br>i think i think that's<br>a sparrow or something chasing a worm uh<br>a range of stamps competitively priced<br>you can see a quarter of a cent for a<br>hedgehog stamp<br>uh and i even tried to set up a little<br>uh restaurant franchise there<br>um<br>don't be concerned hedgehogs were not on<br>the menu that was purely decorative<br>purposes um i was looking at the menu<br>the other day<br>and um yeah it was a pretty<br>wide range of things there was toasted<br>marmite toast and honey toast and jam<br>toast and butter i think so<br>for some reason the franchise never<br>and last but not least um there was a<br>newsletter michael again<br>uh<br>incorporating michaelson news here uh<br>really<br>addressing the big issues asking the big<br>questions will mount michaelson erupt<br>soon<br>um<br>i think it's still available in print<br>for five cents there if<br>um<br>somewhere along there i<br>actually yeah i think the remarkable<br>thing about this i wanted to mention was<br>not the fact that i actually put all<br>this time and made all these things but<br>the fact that i did all this and i still<br>had friends so<br>i am<br>staggered by that to this very day<br>so this is hopi beach school it's a<br>picture i got off the web<br>almost unrecognizable from when my<br>brothers and i were there it's i'm<br>looking a lot flasher but um here's a<br>little stream that i studied coming down<br>from this bush reserve in the background<br>there<br>i had i guess a fairly unremarkable time<br>at fukutani intermediate fakadani high<br>school<br>and then i know a number of you in the<br>audience today will recognize this<br>bullying this is a zoology department at<br>the university of otago<br>uh where i went and did my first degree<br>so<br>did a bachelor's of science in zoology<br>there at that point no interest<br>whatsoever in microbiology<br>didn't do a single micro paper found<br>them deathly boring<br>um<br>over a couple of summers while i was at<br>university in otago i had the good<br>fortune to spend some time up at<br>the lee marine lab<br>north<br>um of auckland here and so it was kind<br>of a<br>easy choice for me<br>to come up<br>this way to do my master's degree after<br>i finished up at otago and i was<br>actually enrolled in this department<br>at sbs but<br>excuse me all my research was based up<br>at the lee lab<br>under i have to say the expert<br>supervision of alwyn reese who's here<br>and i know alwyn specifically didn't<br>want me to mention him or go on about<br>him so i'll do just that um arwen was a<br>fantastic supervisor i really learned an<br>awful lot my project was on<br>nitrogen ammonium uptake in seaweeds<br>and um yeah i i guess arwen was first of<br>a number of really important mentors<br>i've had over the years and taught me a<br>lot about scientific rigor and the<br>importance of<br>of having a strong work ethic etc<br>so this was a first couple of papers i<br>had came out in 1999<br>um<br>and uh yeah you'll notice this little<br>author here um it's my big brother<br>richard was just finishing up his phd at<br>lee<br>when i was there um starting my masters<br>and<br>again um a very important mentor to me<br>over the years i very much doubt whether<br>i would have gone into academia at all<br>um if it hadn't been<br>uh if i hadn't had the opportunity to<br>if that's for me can you tell them i'm<br>busy please<br>um<br>yeah i've learned an awful lot from<br>richard over the years and um<br>about maintaining scientific integrity<br>and and being a a good academic and<br>an important sounding board for me uh to<br>this very day thank you brother<br>okay so after my master's for some<br>reason i decided it was time to do some<br>microbiology so i jumped across the<br>ditch to sydney to the university of new<br>south wales<br>where i did my phd on the ecology of<br>marine sponge associated bacteria<br>i had some great supervisors um peter<br>steinberg or the berg was my main<br>supervisor um co-supervised by stefan<br>kelleberg and rocky denis<br>so really some some great expertise<br>there i learned an awful lot<br>um and i also um the sponge head here<br>otherwise known as peter shoop or the<br>shoe master was a<br>a german postdoc who was spent a couple<br>of years um overlapping with me in<br>sydney and um<br>we published a bunch of papers together<br>and uh<br>remains a very good friend<br>today<br>so after my time in sydney i<br>moved again this time right across the<br>world<br>to the very beautiful city of vienna and<br>see it's a beautiful city no matter what<br>time of year<br>and i was fortunate enough to um<br>almost three years as a postdoctoral<br>research fellow in the lab of mickey<br>wagner who's um<br>remains one of the one of the top<br>microbial ecologists in the world and in<br>my humble opinion at least and i got to<br>work on on a bunch of um<br>different topics sorry here's the point<br>uh i've got to continue my research on<br>marine sponges despite being in a<br>landlocked country<br>uh worked a bit on uh microbes<br>associated with wastewater treatment<br>and was part of this very big<br>multinational project sequencing the<br>genome mother one of these so-called<br>animox bacteria<br>and you can see from the number of<br>authors there that was a very big<br>project it's a<br>microbiobacterium that's still not<br>cultivated so it can't be grown on an<br>agar plate to this very day um but we<br>managed to back in the sort of early<br>2000s we managed to sequence almost the<br>entire genome of this of this bug which<br>is um<br>somewhat of a big deal at that time<br>um towards the end of my um<br>almost three years in vienna i was very<br>fortunate to interview for and<br>get my current job here so this was<br>back at end of 2006 i was interviewing<br>in 2007 is when i started<br>so<br>um you're going to be wondering i think<br>why there's a quote saying research<br>career suicide there that's not my quote<br>um this is something i heard third hand<br>from someone when<br>they found out i was moving back to new<br>zealand and i want to put it there<br>because<br>i want to call bs on that because<br>uh or fake news<br>so<br>luckily i ignored that ridiculous<br>comments at the time and 15 years on i<br>find it even more ridiculous<br>personally i find new zealand a<br>fantastic place to do research and this<br>university this department in particular<br>got some amazing colleagues<br>um<br>i guess<br>we will always complain about not having<br>enough science funding but i think that<br>goes for academics anywhere in the world<br>um but yeah i've certainly found this<br>country a really great place to to do<br>research and<br>a lot of you will remember a former<br>colleague of ours called mark halber who<br>um i overlapped with a couple of years<br>when i started here and i distinctly<br>remember mark saying to me once early on<br>that he found the the phd students the<br>postgraduate students here at the<br>university of auckland equal to or<br>better than anywhere else in the world<br>and you know to provide some context<br>there mark did his phd at an ivy league<br>university in the states he'd been at a<br>bunch of highfalutin<br>institutes around the world and um i<br>have to say i entirely agree with this<br>assessment the students at this<br>university fantastic<br>and um yeah i've certainly found it a<br>great place to do research<br>and teaching and just being part of the<br>academic community<br>so i have a<br>swathe of people to i'd like to thank<br>here<br>um<br>back from from the early days<br>particularly i'd like to<br>acknowledge judy o'brien who's very<br>kindly here tonight judy was the<br>director of teaching at sbs when i<br>started here and um<br>i think it's fair to say that almost<br>everything i know about teaching i i<br>learned from jude so i'd done very<br>little teaching before i arrived but<br>it was fantastic to have<br>judy's support and mentorship over the<br>years<br>and<br>over the years grew to become very close<br>friends and i've i've always appreciated<br>jude's guidance<br>in the classroom and and beyond through<br>some<br>at times uh challenging times<br>uh jillian lewis also um<br>julian very kindly gave what she<br>referred to as a license to bother when<br>i started here<br>and i certainly um exercised that<br>license and had had a range of<br>in hindsight probably pretty dumb<br>questions but she was always very<br>accommodating and<br>an open door when i wanted to um<br>ask about the latest university process<br>or whatever<br>sue turner also i shared lab space with<br>sue for the first five years i was here<br>and sue was always extremely welcoming<br>really a great colleague<br>karine david started on the exact same<br>day as i did here at the university<br>unfortunately we're losing her she's<br>going back to france in a matter of<br>three three and a half weeks or so um to<br>take up an exciting role there but um it<br>was certainly great having having a<br>buddy to<br>talk to and<br>i guess bounce around ideas about<br>developing our teaching and research<br>programs and things so um<br>yeah you'll you'll be miscarried for<br>sure<br>uh matt goddard was another colleague a<br>lot of you remember he was he arrived<br>here i think about two years before i<br>did and um<br>yeah very good friend of mine he's back<br>in the uk now um but we used to have a<br>lot of uh early morning<br>um chats about how we're going to save<br>the world etc over over tea and coffee<br>and things<br>so i'd also like to mention um i guess<br>more generally about teaching and i<br>think teaching is something you never<br>really master or i i certainly haven't<br>and continue to learn all the time and<br>there's just a few people<br>i want to acknowledge in that context<br>here um<br>among others james brock cat jones julie<br>macintosh and suzanne reed are all<br>people i continue to to learn from um<br>all the time and certainly appreciate<br>the<br>um the important and guidance they get<br>okay so um<br>another thing that i've been extremely<br>passionate about in addition to research<br>and teaching over the years is um trying<br>to contribute to the development of<br>microbial ecology as a discipline in<br>this country<br>okay and i certainly hasn't been a solo<br>effort i've had a<br>whole bunch of people have been working<br>with and i just want to highlight a<br>couple of<br>uh<br>particularly two partners in crime here<br>uh the first is associate professor matt<br>stott from the university of canterbury<br>and that's up here this evening<br>nice to see you matt<br>um<br>we independently i think back in 2009<br>kind of<br>came up with or we were both thinking um<br>that it would be nice to have some sort<br>of dedicated forum to microbial ecology<br>in this country which hadn't existed up<br>to that point so we um<br>uh started chatting and came up with<br>this thing called the new zealand<br>microbial ecology consortium or nz mech<br>and um that's kind of grown from<br>strength to strength over the years it's<br>something we<br>both really like putting together we're<br>about to have our seventh event in a few<br>months here at sbs we typically get<br>about 100 to 150 people come along to<br>those in the really nice collegial<br>events and help to build a sort of sense<br>of community in this country around<br>microbial ecology<br>um the other person i want to mention is<br>gavin leah or king lear as he insists on<br>being called<br>not sure what that's about but um<br>gavin's also been a really important<br>colleague over the years here's the<br>office next to mine so we sometimes have<br>conversations through the wall because<br>the walls are so thin<br>um<br>and we've taught together a lot over the<br>years and developed a teaching programs<br>together<br>and i particularly want to mention<br>something here which is<br>actually alan already touched on it so<br>the the 20th international symposium on<br>microbial ecology so<br>barring convention further convention<br>center fires or another global pandemic<br>between now and 2026 we'll be having<br>that meeting which typically gets about<br>1500 or 2 000 people um<br>right here to auckland which is very<br>exciting<br>uh matt is also um part of our<br>organizing committee for is me 20 as is<br>um craig cary who's come up from um<br>university of waikato this evening and i<br>also want to mention craig as he's been<br>one of my um<br>uh referees in the last couple of<br>promotion applications i've gone for so<br>always um<br>always good to keep the referees happy<br>so thank you craig for that support<br>okay so from my uh partners in crime<br>there to my partner in life<br>uh indeed the the love of my life<br>uh is my um<br>amazing wife christy<br>who's um very much in a whole different<br>class to me but has very graciously been<br>slumming it down at my level for the<br>and<br>this is a photo from our wedding and<br>honeymoon in tahiti<br>back in 2014 so it's a lovely place of<br>course in tahiti very romantic just for<br>the two of<br>oh<br>just for the three of us i forgot we had<br>a chaperone there so<br>um this is a little guy jasper when he<br>was four and a half months old came<br>along for for a wedding and honeymoon<br>and i guess gives a<br>new meaning to the phrase of honeymoon<br>so um<br>he's not a little boy anymore he's a<br>hulking eight-year-old sitting down the<br>front here<br>um<br>maya is also here my daughter um almost<br>six years old<br>and christy and i also have um baby<br>felix who's almost two years old he's um<br>it's a bit of a late night for him this<br>one so he's at home with granny<br>hopefully going to bed about now<br>actually<br>um and i also have uh two older kids<br>okay i think this is pretty much my last<br>slide for thanking people and<br>there's no way i was going to<br>go without thanking all these people so<br>i get to stand up here and speak to you<br>all about my research but um<br>i'm only steering the ship this is<br>really the the engine behind everything<br>that makes everything work so<br>i've had a fantastic bunch of<br>people in my lab over the years um these<br>are various um students technicians um<br>postdocs that have had the good fortune<br>uh to work with and you'll honestly<br>never find a nicer bunch or brighter<br>bunch of people and<br>mark harbour was right all those years<br>ago about the um fantastic students we<br>okay so<br>as i was putting this talk together i<br>kind of thought well how do i define<br>myself from a work point of view and i<br>think i've maybe encapsulated it here i<br>guess i'm a microbial ecologist that<br>focuses mostly on interactions between<br>microbes and animal hosts<br>and<br>these are terms you'll<br>often see<br>including in the newspaper the term<br>microbiome comes up quite a bit<br>microbota is a similar term i'm going to<br>use them interchangeably here which is a<br>bit naughty but<br>close enough and basically what i'm<br>talking about there is the community of<br>microorganisms so bacteria fungi viruses<br>etc<br>that live in a particular environment so<br>you've probably heard of the gut<br>interactions between animal hosts and<br>microbes span a real gamut of<br>interaction types ranging from harmful<br>where microbes might cause disease or<br>bit parasite of a host<br>through to really tightly linked<br>symbiotic relationships where both the<br>host and the microbe benefit these are<br>often based around<br>nutrition<br>really a real central goal of my team's<br>research is to try and understand which<br>organisms are associated with which<br>which hosts and why<br>and to do this we utilize a variety of<br>methods but particularly so-called<br>cultivation independent or dna based<br>methodology<br>okay so<br>um i was learning how to kind of convey<br>i guess the different things i've worked<br>on over my over the years i've worked on<br>a lot of different things probably too<br>many in all honesty for a serious<br>scientific career i need to focus a<br>little bit more<br>everything's interesting and<br>i don't know if that's a blessing or a<br>curse but<br>anyway uh publishing<br>a number of different topics um i'm<br>excluding here those uh seminal<br>michelson national park publications<br>early on<br>um but um my wife christy has very<br>kindly<br>put together one of these word clouds<br>for me so um<br>if you're not familiar with these<br>so what christie's done was<br>created an automated process to<br>essentially mine the text and my various<br>publications<br>and these are the words that come up<br>most often okay and and the bigger the<br>word um the more often i've used it in<br>my publication so<br>not surprisingly for a microbiologist i<br>guess things like bacterial microbial<br>sequences community all come up<br>frequently<br>and<br>also sponges here and again maybe not<br>surprising that's the topic that i did<br>my phd on i've worked on it for a number<br>here as well<br>so that gives a little bit of an<br>overview but i think it may be more<br>interesting when we um just<br>look at a little bit more detail and<br>break it down by time so<br>before i arrived here so my first<br>publications were those ones with alwyn<br>in 1999<br>and i arrived here at the end of 2006 so<br>um<br>looking at those publications we again<br>see things like sponges coming through<br>so i started to publish my phd work<br>bacterial microbial again<br>but also ammonium i think this reflects<br>the the work i did with alwyn and my<br>masters looking at ammonium uptake in<br>seaweeds and also some of the wastewater<br>treatment work i did in my postdoc<br>so fast forward a few years and we'll<br>look at this is the first eight years of<br>my time here and you can see it's all<br>about sponges<br>um we published quite a lot on that<br>topic over that time and<br>um seeing little hints of other things<br>here we've got kakapo and small letters<br>down here um scale which<br>refer is referring to scale insects<br>um just also also some work we did<br>so that was up until 2014 and then if we<br>look at the most recent eight years<br>we've got a completely different story<br>emerging here so<br>sponges are now relegated to this<br>relatively small text out on the outer<br>periphery and we've got some new words<br>coming through things like human gut<br>crs which is an acronym for chronic<br>rhinositis which is a chronic sinus<br>disease that we've worked on quite a bit<br>over the years<br>and some of these other terms like<br>disease nasal microbiome etc are coming<br>through so<br>that was a fairly conscious decision of<br>mine that i was phasing out sponge<br>research i don't work on any marine<br>stuff anymore<br>and have been much more heavily into<br>human microbiome over the last few years<br>and i dare say in another eight years<br>okay so i'm going to focus on um two<br>main sort of cool research stories um<br>uh for the next few minutes um<br>as i was putting this talk together i<br>quite enjoyed it actually um<br>reminded me of a few things and got me<br>thinking about uh some ideas and things<br>but what i really didn't like was kind<br>of realization very early on that i<br>wasn't going to be able to talk about<br>everything and i was going to have to<br>leave out some really important<br>collaborations and um<br>and you know bodies of work that i've<br>really invested a lot of energy and time<br>in and unfortunately i just can't talk<br>about everything so<br>i'll touch on those briefly but i'm<br>going to talk in more detail about<br>sponges obviously in those word clouds<br>you'll see up that's been quite a big<br>focus over the years<br>and more recently we do quite a lot of<br>work in the threatened species<br>conservation space and i think<br>that's probably the area where i feel we<br>can make the biggest impact in our<br>research<br>so i'll talk about that<br>so on those other ones um human gut<br>microbiome<br>and really i don't do justice to these<br>projects by flicking over them so<br>quickly so my apologies for that but<br>um<br>this is why i got into human microbiome<br>research in the first place have a<br>strong family<br>familiar connection with with autism<br>and um so i wanted to learn about the<br>gut microbiome and autism and see if we<br>could contribute to that um<br>that field of knowledge and i was very<br>fortunate to work with some fantastic<br>colleagues here um russell snell jesse<br>jacobson uh ross hill neurologist<br>mentioned down here are really i think<br>with the driving forces behind the minds<br>for minds research network um trying to<br>unlock the secrets of autism class<br>leonard was also a big part of that uh<br>joe montgomery up at the center for<br>brain research really important<br>collaborator i've worked on a human<br>research council grant together and um<br>giselle wong is a phd student who did<br>some great work there and<br>also mention a collaborator pratima and<br>um students alex and chris who have<br>and again this work deserves much more<br>than half a slide and a minute talking<br>about it but um<br>such is life so metabolic health so uh<br>pre-diabetes type 2 diabetes this has<br>been another really important<br>collaboration um i got into this uh with<br>sally poppet who was here at sbs is now<br>back in the uk<br>uh more recently jennifer miles chan's<br>kind of taken over sally's role<br>uh danielle middleton who's here tonight<br>was a postdoc in my lab did some of the<br>early work in our lab on this topic and<br>akash mathrani did his phd<br>and and a host of other honourable<br>mentions down the bottom here for some<br>some great collaborators and students<br>out of the gut and onto the the airway<br>microbiome<br>um this is a really important<br>collaboration i had going for a number<br>of years um looking at<br>ear nose and throat<br>microbiology and immunology and this is<br>really spearheaded by this force of<br>nature here um professor richard douglas<br>he's a<br>ent surgeon up at the medical school<br>in the department of surgery<br>and uh and christie senior research<br>fellow<br>also integral part of this and we've had<br>some fantastic phd students<br>uh over the years as well and i think i<br>counted up with<br>published 28 papers with these guys on<br>this topic and my apologies just for<br>giving<br>half a half a slide here<br>um i'll also uh like to mention<br>specifically mike hogg out there mike<br>won the vice chancellor's prize for best<br>doctoral thesis in 2019 and<br>just to put that in context there's<br>about 400 i think it is phds conferred<br>across the university each year and only<br>five of these prizes given out so it's<br>certainly no small achievement<br>to get that<br>he still hasn't given me any of his<br>prize money<br>uh pediatric respiratory disease is<br>another topic we've um<br>worked on in collaboration with naveen<br>polarisetti a physician at starship uh<br>david broderick recently finished his<br>phd on this topic did some great work<br>and i'd also just mention our australian<br>also just wanted to make sure i<br>mentioned um<br>these projects<br>uh manpreet was my<br>very first honors student<br>and then went on to do uh do her<br>phd with um jacqueline begs and myself<br>on the topic of<br>bacterial symbionts of scale and sex and<br>these are really ecologically important<br>um<br>insects in many new zealand forests and<br>before mumpreet's work virtually nothing<br>was known about their microbiology so<br>she did some really great work there<br>and thank you for coming up this evening<br>manfred from<br>from the south island<br>uh antarctic bacteria this work i did<br>with um<br>melissa de souza was the phd student in<br>collaboration with um sue turner and<br>jackie azlaby<br>and um dabbled in a little bit of wine<br>microbiology which was was fun with uh<br>with matt goddard who i mentioned<br>earlier<br>okay so i now want to take a slightly<br>deeper dive i um<br>into two topics here um first of all<br>marine sponges and their microbes<br>and i'll just focus on on one particular<br>story um where i feel like we've made<br>some sort of contribution to over the<br>years<br>so sponges are pretty cool animals are<br>among the most ancient of the<br>multicellular animals<br>sort of thought to be about six or seven<br>hundred million years old<br>they're prolific filter feeders they<br>just sit on the bottom of the ocean and<br>just filter sea water all day and<br>capture microbes and microalgae and<br>things through these sort of elaborate<br>they're renowned for having um<br>or for producing um all sorts of<br>uh so-called bioactive or biologically<br>active chemicals and many of them seem<br>to have anti-cancer properties<br>some of them seem to be<br>produced by the sponges and some of them<br>produced by microorganisms living within<br>the sponges and you can see here there's<br>really they can have dense and diverse<br>microbial communities this is an ultra<br>thin<br>section through a sponge but form a<br>postdoc of mine says on a schmidt and<br>these are all microbial cells here so<br>they're really densely packed in there<br>in certain sponges there's about as much<br>microbial biomass in there as there is<br>actual um<br>so in terms of the microbiology some of<br>the earliest kind of seminal work in<br>this area back in the 1970s<br>people<br>um<br>found that um different bacteria were<br>found in sponges versus the surrounding<br>sea water and<br>sponges sit there filtering sea water<br>all day tens of thousands of liters of<br>it<br>and yet they have different bacteria<br>than in the surrounding seawater<br>okay so<br>that early evidence was based on<br>microscopy and cultivating bugs on agar<br>plates uh in the dna age so we're<br>talking early 2000's here um<br>it was supporting evidence basically<br>that many bacteria<br>were found in unrelated and<br>geographically widespread sponges but<br>not in seawater okay so that same kind<br>of theme you get different bugs and<br>sponges and seawater and if you have<br>sponges on different parts of the world<br>they seem to have the same bugs but<br>again those bugs weren't found in sea<br>water so<br>how do they spread between these<br>different sponges<br>and some some of the work um<br>we did<br>ourselves uh we've contributed to this<br>body of knowledge and further supported<br>this notion of these so-called sponge<br>specific bacteria<br>um that were considered to only occur in<br>sponges and<br>i've underlined here an important point<br>based on the technology at the time and<br>i'll i'll come back and explain that in<br>okay so<br>christy very kindly put this nice<br>picture together for me just to explain<br>this a little bit more<br>um<br>let's say this is this is a marine<br>sponge off the coast of auckland here<br>and a corresponding sea water sample<br>collected at the same time and what you<br>can hopefully see is that there's an<br>array of different microorganisms in the<br>sponge and they pretty much don't<br>overlap with the organ with the microbes<br>in the surrounding sea water<br>hopefully you can see that<br>and no matter where in the world you go<br>whether it's up in the mediterranean or<br>off the coast of california you get a<br>similar kind of pattern yeah<br>um<br>sponges and seawater tended to be<br>largely not completely but largely<br>non-overlapping so that's one take home<br>from the slide the other take home is<br>that<br>these different sponges in different<br>parts of the world had a lot of the same<br>bacteria so you can see this this white<br>one here turning up in all the sponges<br>likewise these red star shaped ones and<br>the black star shaped ones turn up in<br>all our sponges but<br>not in sea water evidently<br>so this had some potentially important<br>uh evolutionary implications and<br>ecological implications where did these<br>bugs come from how do they spread<br>between the<br>sponges but we actually hypothesized<br>that<br>well maybe these bacteria are also found<br>in seawater<br>but are so rare that we just can't<br>so<br>this is where technology came to the to<br>the rescue<br>uh not particularly at the forefront of<br>technological advancements um<br>uh in my research i don't think but this<br>is some case where we one case where we<br>were fairly early adopters of new<br>technology and it really helped us out<br>so just as a little aside<br>this is a<br>horrible machine called<br>dgg or denaturing gradient gel<br>electrophoresis if any of you have ever<br>used this wheel of fortune to pour<br>acrylamide gels you're probably<br>suffering ptsd at the moment because it<br>really really wasn't much fun but<br>i did a lot of these during my phd<br>and um just what you could do is you<br>you'd get this kind of banding pattern<br>and<br>each band on on the gel here would it<br>equate to a bacterial species you could<br>cut those<br>bands out and try and sequence them and<br>over the course of my more or less five<br>year phd i obtained 15 sequences<br>okay so no not much<br>um<br>better technology was clone libraries<br>that that used to be the kind of gold<br>standard for describing microbial<br>communities<br>i did one of these clone libraries from<br>one sponge sample in my phd got about<br>100 sequences which is better than 15.<br>um<br>and most of the evidence for sponge<br>pacific bacteria that i was talking<br>about comes from these clone libraries<br>then it was quantum leap in the sort of<br>mid-2000s this so-called next-generation<br>sequencing came along and now like uh<br>if i have a master student in my my lab<br>maybe they've never done any lab work<br>whatsoever they can quickly<br>get up to speed with the technology and<br>in a one year masters they could easily<br>do four or five hundred samples<br>and get about 20 000 high quality<br>sequences per sample okay so you know if<br>you told me that back when i started my<br>phd it would have seemed like science<br>fiction okay so<br>um<br>the reason i'm telling you all this<br>becomes clear in a minute but yeah we've<br>basically gone from you know clone<br>libraries being able to get maybe 100<br>odd sequences out of a sample<br>to now being able to get you know tens<br>and that was important because of that<br>hypothesis i suggested was are these<br>so-called sponge-specific bacteria<br>actually maybe they're not so<br>sponge-specific after all maybe they're<br>kind of lurking away in in the rare<br>seawater biosphere and i'll explain what<br>i mean by that here<br>this is a rank abundance curve<br>um it would look like this if you're<br>looking at a diverse bacterial community<br>or<br>maybe insects in a tropical rainforest<br>for example and what you're going to<br>have is a a small number of very<br>abundant species so this is abundance on<br>the y axis here so here's our most<br>abundant species our next most abundant<br>species<br>and fairly quickly<br>you get down into what we call this long<br>tail of really rare species<br>and those sort of old school clone<br>libraries if we're only getting 100 odd<br>sequences out you know these are<br>probably the guys we're detecting<br>but<br>if we want to get down into what's been<br>termed the rare biosphere these really<br>rare species this is when we needed next<br>generation sequencing<br>and while we were kind of considering<br>all the stuff this was back during my<br>sort of postdoc days and things uh<br>around 2007 um<br>there was a thing came along called the<br>international census of marine microbes<br>or icom as part of the census of marine<br>life this global initiative<br>uh they put out a call for project<br>proposals to use this next generation<br>sequencing on 16 samples so<br>we we julie put in a proposal and um<br>that was accepted<br>and we ran this project using some<br>sponges on the great barrier reef so<br>this is a nice collaboration there's<br>three species of sponge and three<br>individuals of each uh were collected<br>off davies reef off townsville<br>and um larvae of ropalordies as well<br>and importantly for this question we<br>obtained four seawater samples so this<br>was all about trying to test that<br>hypothesis are these bugs really sponge<br>so what did we find this next generation<br>sequencing provided us with about 25 000<br>sequences per sample<br>we detected 33 previously identified<br>so-called sponge pacific bacteria<br>a little under half of them we only<br>found them sponges and or their larvae<br>so that supported this notion of them<br>being sponge specific<br>but the remainder were detected in<br>seawater but again only at very low<br>abundances so out of maybe 25 000<br>sequences from a sample maybe like five<br>not five thousand but five<br>of those sequences might have been these<br>so-called sponge pacific bacteria so it<br>sort of<br>supported our hypothesis that they<br>in a follow-up study where we analyzed<br>the entire icom data set so this was<br>more than 12 million sequences we data<br>mined them there's more than 600 and<br>649 samples from there's our sponges<br>there but also sea water sediment deep<br>sea hydrothermal vents etc<br>the numbers are<br>pretty cool<br>the numbers aren't too important there<br>but uh the upshot of it is that uh we<br>detected a lot of these so-called<br>sponge-specific bacteria outside of<br>sponges okay but they were always very<br>rare<br>so where did that leave us in terms of<br>hypothesis um indeed we seem to be able<br>to detect them with this new technology<br>and you can start to see you know this<br>white one and the red guy coming coming<br>through in seawater but only very rare<br>so that supported our hypothesis and and<br>really this advance in technology was<br>like it's like getting new new glasses<br>basically right so in the past<br>had really crappy eyesight couldn't<br>couldn't see much all of a sudden we can<br>see<br>what going from 100 to 25 000. what's<br>that a<br>250 fold increase in our ability to see<br>these organisms<br>so we've got some uh nice papers out<br>over this time and i particularly want<br>to mention um three people here nick<br>webster was a really great collaborator<br>of mine on a range of different sponge<br>projects she was at the australian<br>institute for marine science she's now<br>the<br>chief scientist for the australian<br>antarctic division in hobart<br>uh peter psy who's um along here this<br>evening peter was really instrumental in<br>us developing the ability to do these<br>analyses in this next generation<br>sequencing data so i want to thank for<br>introducing us to um<br>peter was his programmer at the time in<br>the bioinformatics institute and<br>peter did some fantastic work with us<br>over the years i very much appreciate<br>his um his role and rachel semester<br>who's also here this evening<br>um rachel was my very first phd student<br>and um like my cage that i mentioned<br>before rachel won the vice chancellor's<br>best doctoral thesis prize in 2013.<br>um<br>so and did some some really amazing work<br>on some of these sponge microbes and<br>rachel's based in vancouver now but is<br>um<br>fortuitously currently in the country<br>visiting family so great to have you<br>here<br>okay before i move on and talk for a few<br>minutes uh about our conservation stuff<br>i just wanted to mention<br>uh this<br>paper which is probably my paper that<br>i'm most proud of has been<br>probably close to a year during my<br>postdoc in vienna uh working on the<br>analyses and the writing of of this this<br>is a big it's a 53 page review<br>in print<br>my best cited paper by some degree and i<br>just wanted to<br>i guess feed my own ego here by showing<br>you this nice review<br>so reviewer one said it was a pleasure<br>to read this review i've read it<br>carefully twice found remarkably few<br>errors i have a few suggestions that may<br>slightly improve the review however it's<br>so well written that it could be<br>published almost as it stands so<br>obviously big hit at that point i think<br>ah fantastic<br>how amazing am i and uh what are the<br>other reviewer have to say reviewer two<br>i'm indeed convinced that the manuscript<br>should not be published<br>all right<br>in the journal mmbr well that's<br>different<br>the major reason for the old-fashioned<br>descriptions given by the authors is<br>their lack of understanding in<br>biochemistry and biology<br>bloody hell that's not so good<br>um<br>went on based on the above mentioned<br>insufficiencies i'm sincerely convinced<br>that this manuscript should not be<br>published in mmbr so<br>not only convinced but sincerely<br>convinced as well<br>i thought okay well maybe we can make<br>major revisions here and then it'll be<br>acceptable oh no<br>also a major revision of the manuscript<br>will to my judgment not help to bring<br>this manuscript to an acceptable form<br>so hard to believe they were reviewing<br>the same manuscript but um different<br>takes on it fortunately reviewer 3 was<br>somewhat more positive than reviewer 2<br>and the editor was sympathetic so we<br>managed to push that one through and um<br>yeah it's<br>gone on to be a<br>quite well cited paper<br>okay um for the last few minutes i'd<br>like to focus on<br>um some of our work uh<br>looking at the microbiome in the context<br>of threatened species conservation topic<br>very uh passionate about takes me back<br>to you know where i started a zoologist<br>uh and this is kind of the context for<br>our work i guess this is nicely summed<br>up this is a<br>nice figure that vivian ward put<br>together for us<br>uh in a paper from a phd student annie<br>west um<br>published early in her phd<br>so what we see over on the left here is<br>a not particularly happy looking carcapo<br>looking a bit dull<br>the microbiome's not looking very very<br>rosy there<br>what's gone wrong it seems to have what<br>we might call a dysbiotic microbiome so<br>basically<br>a not very good an unhealthy microbiome<br>if you like unbalanced and that could be<br>due to any number of reasons perhaps<br>disease maybe antibiotics especially in<br>um very intensely managed species like<br>like kakapo<br>habitat change alterations and diet<br>maybe there's certain plant species that<br>um animal might rely on that you know<br>through habitat degradation might be<br>removed from their environment and that<br>might adversely affect their microbiome<br>as well<br>and captivity effects are well known to<br>affect microbiome of a range of<br>different taxa<br>so what we'd like to do is be able to go<br>from this kind of dull looking<br>microbiome and unhappy looking kakapo<br>here just something like this much<br>perkier one over here nice colorful<br>microbiome<br>um<br>if you have a healthy microbiome whether<br>you're a human or a kakapo that can help<br>you resist disease-causing pathogens<br>improve host health in general potential<br>fitness reproduction gains as well<br>so our work is really focused on you<br>know describing these microbiomes<br>figuring out what's there<br>how we think they should look and how we<br>might achieve going from this side over<br>to this side and that's kind of the<br>realm of i guess microbiome engineering<br>so<br>can we promote a more healthy microbiome<br>by giving them more natural food if<br>they're in captivity maybe<br>probiotics so beneficial microbes even<br>fecal transplants have been used in a<br>range of things including kakapo also<br>koalas and<br>so<br>new zealand is an ideal location<br>unfortunately for threatened species<br>research it's unfortunate because it<br>means we have we haven't looked after<br>our biodiversity very well we've got a<br>lot of endangered species but it's also<br>fortunate in one regard that we have a<br>lot of interesting organisms to look at<br>no less a person than jared diamond<br>described endemic fauna as the nearest<br>approach to life on another planet so<br>that's what sort of 60 odd million years<br>of geographic isolation can do for you<br>getting all these wacky things like<br>mowers<br>uh tuatara<br>kiwi of course um and and takahe and<br>we've recently started working on the<br>tuatara microbiome um with with danielle<br>who's here tonight<br>and um and he's recently published a<br>nice paper on the takahe microbiome as<br>well<br>okay so um<br>here's the kakapo<br>and um<br>very charismatic<br>organism there i don't know how to stop<br>that video so you're just gonna have to<br>keep watching it while i<br>introduce these people uh dave wade uh<br>when he wasn't um being a policeman<br>there um<br>i really spearheaded this work in my lab<br>his um honours and phd student who<br>really got this work going peter diners<br>was a<br>postdoc from germany who was also<br>instrumental in the early work elena<br>perry spent a year in my lab as a<br>fulbright fellow from the states and<br>annie west just finished up a really<br>nice phd also working on the kakapo<br>microbiome<br>and i also want to mention<br>actually jacqueline bags i<br>mentioned before jaclyn<br>really<br>got us into this work in the first place<br>which is much appreciated it's really<br>one of my most fun projects<br>and the rest of the kakapo recovery team<br>at doc you know we couldn't do any of<br>this work without their support and<br>andrew and the team have been incredibly<br>supportive which we very much appreciate<br>so the kakapo gut microbiomes of<br>surprisingly low diversity meaning that<br>there's not many different types of<br>bacteria in there and<br>that was surprising to us at least<br>initially because most herbivores so<br>most plant-eating things i think in cows<br>sheep termites um have a really diverse<br>range of a whole lot of different<br>microbes in them to help them break down<br>that plant material<br>kakapo is not so much there's various<br>reasons for that that i won't delve into<br>now but<br>a lot of kakapo individuals tend to<br>really be dominated by basically by by e<br>coli<br>so the kakapo is probably one of the<br>most intensively managed species in the<br>world<br>um and you know that's been great for<br>the conservation efforts done wonders<br>for the kakapo population but you know<br>we're particularly interested in what<br>does that mean for its gut microbiome<br>when the birds are being hand reared or<br>they're given a cocktail of antibiotics<br>and antifungals etc when they get sick<br>and they also get this sort of<br>supplemental feed as well so you know<br>what if anything is is that doing to the<br>calcapo microbiome is one of our main<br>so i want to talk about the so-called<br>poo removal experiment here um glamorous<br>titles for our work<br>um this is some fantastic work that<br>annie<br>did during her phd in the process of<br>hopefully getting it published shortly<br>and um we're exploring here uh uh common<br>um management practice from the the doc<br>team<br>so<br>for uh the last few um infrequent<br>breeding seasons<br>um the the rangers would remove excess<br>fecal material<br>um from the kakapo nests and it was<br>assumed that that was a good thing maybe<br>um<br>minimize chances of disease etc but the<br>reality was no one had ever really<br>tested that no one ever really knew if<br>that was a good thing or not and<br>conceivably it might have been a<br>negative thing from the point of view of<br>the gut microbiome because maybe that's<br>one of the sources of inocula<br>um where juvenile kakapo get their<br>their bugs from<br>so this is just uh<br>one of the grass from a couple of the<br>graphs from annie here here we've got<br>observed bacterial species on the<br>vertical axis and different experimental<br>groups along the bottom here so<br>particularly i want you to<br>draw your attention to here's feces in<br>which means no feces were removed<br>versus the treatment where feces were<br>removed and<br>we saw virtually no difference in in the<br>number of bacterial species or the<br>composition of those species okay so<br>it didn't really seem to have an effect<br>and likewise if you looked at the<br>nesting material that litter similar<br>story<br>what really did have an effect as you<br>can see there's a big difference here a<br>big drop in diversity in birds that were<br>hand reared okay so we'll explore that a<br>little bit more in a second<br>um<br>on the back of this and some of their<br>doc no longer has this practice of poo<br>removal so in the latest uh breeding<br>season um that that wasn't continued so<br>so i said a bit earlier i feel this is<br>an area where we can we have such a good<br>close collaboration with the doc team<br>that we feel that um<br>you know we can actually contribute<br>something quite quite useful to the<br>conservation effort which is really<br>gratifying<br>hand rearing as you saw uh does affect<br>the fecal microbiome of kakapo chicks<br>so here we've got i don't know if you<br>can read that but these are samples from<br>birds that are in hand rearing here and<br>you can see they look quite different<br>from birds that are out on pukanui or<br>fenugo islands<br>okay and in particular you get a lot of<br>this red bacterium so these are<br>different bacteria<br>i know you can't read this but that's<br>fine the red one is lactobacillus<br>gassery<br>and um<br>we're quite certain that has come from<br>the artificial food that the um<br>uh henry and kakapo get<br>so it does affect the fecal microbiome<br>but the effect only seems to be<br>transient<br>this is increasing chick age as we go<br>across here so from less than 20 days up<br>to sort of 200 plus days<br>and<br>these are the hand-reared uh so samples<br>from hand reared birds<br>at the line underneath here and you can<br>see there's a lot of that lactobacillus<br>um i think that was my timer was it alan<br>does that mean i have was that something<br>else sorry i thought i thought that was<br>my timer that i only have another 90<br>minutes to go<br>um<br>and in the older birds here um they lose<br>this lactobacillus so<br>it seems to have a transient effect<br>um<br>on the basis of this and other aspects<br>um doc continues to work on the<br>formulation of these artificial foods<br>for hand-rearing chicks<br>so and he's done some really really nice<br>work there<br>um<br>a couple of slides before i finish up<br>and apologies for going a little bit<br>over time here um<br>busy times ahead i'll just<br>like to talk about all these in detail<br>but but i won't i'm in the threatened<br>species space we've got lots happening<br>um looking at ancient carcapo<br>microbiomes this is<br>our work driven by janet warmshurst<br>fantastic collaborator at manaki finnua<br>lanca research siri hermanns who's here<br>tonight's also involved in this work<br>two new phd students natalie aeris<br>recently started natalie's looking at<br>antibiotic resistance in kakapo<br>and cam hofspec when she can make it<br>here from the states is<br>going to be looking at the tuatara<br>microbiome<br>involved in a project looking at the<br>food web infectome with rebecca french<br>and eddie holmes and crystal cain and<br>sandra anderson from sbs also involved<br>in that work<br>we're continuing with the human<br>microbiome uh safe and tommy are both<br>starting next month looking at gout and<br>metabolic health<br>and it got some grant proposals in at<br>the moment with my australian<br>collaborators looking at pediatric<br>airway disease<br>and last but not least we're getting<br>into the business of the dung beetle<br>microbiome<br>um which is work driven by um danielle<br>and eva at manaki whenua so we through<br>to the second round of mb smart ideas um<br>funding round and we're hoping to get<br>that funded<br>so<br>really the last thing i want to touch<br>upon is again the importance of<br>collaboration and the importance of<br>having a great network um<br>this is a<br>representation a network representation<br>of um the different people have<br>published with this this is me in the<br>middle so the the bigger the circle the<br>more publications i have with these<br>people so by definition i have the<br>bigger circle because i'm on all my own<br>publications<br>uh a small circle like that means i've<br>published one paper with that person<br>um you can see i've published with lots<br>of people over the years which has been<br>a pleasure here with some with my phd<br>supervisors a few papers my time in<br>vienna with mickey wagner and matthias<br>horne's another important collaborator<br>these big circles are big consortium<br>papers we have sort of 20 or 30 odd odd<br>authors<br>from the spongy stuff a few people i<br>mentioned a couple i didn't uh carmen<br>astor dio garcia was a phd student udah<br>henshaw really important collaboration<br>collaborator so we've got a whole bunch<br>of sponge papers there<br>uh jacqueline and manpreet's got some<br>nice papers from montfort's phd on the<br>scale and sex symbiosis<br>dave annie and andrew digby at doc on<br>our threatened species work<br>the fantastic minds for minds team<br>published one paper with them on autism<br>the ent crew you can see a lot of papers<br>there with richard and christy and the<br>team<br>and a recent airway microbiome work that<br>danielle's been involved in and also<br>david and naveen<br>i'd like to thank all the various<br>funding agencies without which any of<br>this work wouldn't have been possible<br>and<br>i'd like to thank you all very much for<br>coming along this evening thank you very<br>much<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
