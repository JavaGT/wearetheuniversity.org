linguistics in the<br>school of linguistics and applied<br>language studies<br>i'm jennifer windsor acting vice<br>chancellor of te herrengawaka victoria<br>university of wellington<br>it's my great pleasure to see everyone<br>here this evening<br>including april's family<br>students guests from the community<br>academic and professional staff<br>colleagues students and other colleagues<br>including from the senior leadership<br>team<br>professor coxhead is an expert in<br>applied linguistics with international<br>renown for guiding both academic and<br>trades-based lexical and grammatical<br>teaching and learning in new zealand and<br>many other countries<br>avril has held academic appointments<br>both here and at mercy university she<br>was named professor in 2020<br>i think it's fair to say that when you<br>spend any time with april you're<br>immediately struck by her supportive<br>optimistic humble humorous often<br>informal scholarly style<br>as well as struck by her respect for her<br>academic mentors and colleagues<br>all of which attributes make her a<br>fabulous university citizen<br>as does her superb teaching postgraduate<br>supervision and leadership of<br>university-wide projects<br>and so it can sometimes be easy to<br>forget<br>that when you are talking with avril<br>you are also talking with the scholar<br>who has written the books and the<br>articles some of the most influential<br>publications in her field on vocabulary<br>and vocabulary instruction<br>fairly early in her career avril<br>developed a theoretical word taxonomy to<br>support tertiary level learning of<br>academic english including<br>academic english as learned by<br>non-native speakers it's the academic<br>word list<br>now academic language is highly<br>technical and to succeed at higher<br>levels of education you need to have a<br>strong core vocabulary of common words<br>in academic text<br>and that's what the academic word list<br>does<br>april is the person who with colleagues<br>through many years now are very careful<br>and precise theoretical and practical<br>work with corpora of millions of words<br>has helped move language teaching and<br>wordless to new educational ground<br>while her work was initially mainly<br>carried out in english it now<br>incorporates languages such as danish<br>tongan and chinese<br>she's expanded her work on academic<br>vocabulary to the equally highly<br>technical traits-based language<br>now her work is both i think prolific<br>and programmatic and it's foundational<br>to the nature of vocabulary instruction<br>textbooks dictionaries learning<br>materials and research in english for<br>academic purposes and english for<br>specific purposes worldwide<br>it is arguably the dominant work of its<br>kind<br>and her work with colleagues on language<br>and trades education has also become a<br>pivotal form of engagement and practice<br>with new zealand's vocational and traits<br>community<br>the impacts of her work can also be seen<br>in our schools the language in the<br>trades education or latte project for<br>example has informed new zealand<br>curriculum initiatives<br>tonight ava will discuss her<br>collaborations on vocabulary for<br>specific purposes in new context and in<br>languages other than english<br>in the invitation to her inaugural<br>avril mentioned a line of poetry from<br>alan conno to describe how moving in new<br>research directions can result in<br>surprising gains<br>she quoted simply by sailing in a new<br>direction you could enlarge the world<br>i dared the second line of that poem<br>you picked your captain<br>keen on discoveries<br>tough enough to make them<br>sums up ave's contributions very well<br>it is my great pleasure to welcome<br>captain and professor<br>avril cox head to the podium<br>first of all thank you so much for that<br>invitation and welcome i'd like to<br>acknowledge my family there are many of<br>us in the audience coxed family members<br>say woop<br>a fair number of us<br>so i'm ava whereas my brother vern<br>always says this is a real she's never<br>left school<br>and and here i am<br>still at school so he's absolutely right<br>don't ever tell him that even though he<br>knows so i'm um vice chancellor members<br>of the um slt council members family at<br>my students and my friends<br>thank you so much for coming along to<br>support me today it means a lot<br>so i'm going to be talking about moving<br>in other directions and going outside<br>comfort zones so i've organised my talk<br>there are two parts good we've done that<br>and we've introduced ellen kuno he's<br>he's somebody that i think this this<br>line has made me think about who i am<br>and the directions that i want to go in<br>and i'm going to talk a bit about that<br>tonight i need to acknowledge paul<br>nation<br>who i can't see<br>hey paul good to see you and john reed<br>as well thank you so you can see that uh<br>paul and i hold each other in high<br>levels of esteem<br>uh that we we don't get along<br>particularly well um but i'd really like<br>to say thanks sport for all of your work<br>and thanks for being here tonight it<br>means a lot to me<br>so i'm an applied linguist and what do<br>applied linguists do apart from go to<br>conferences in<br>japan and you can probably spot me in<br>that picture<br>kissing the sumo wrestler anyway so what<br>do we do applied linguists so we work on<br>real life problems that are caused by<br>language and in my<br>uh case this means vocabulary studies<br>for example in english for academic<br>purposes and english for specific<br>purposes and i'll talk more about these<br>things soon<br>most of the time when people say what do<br>you do i say i'm a teacher because a<br>that's what makes the most sense<br>and<br>b if i say i'm an applied linguist they<br>want to know how many languages do i<br>speak<br>and thank you to jonathan newton for<br>tracking down that particular cartoon<br>for me<br>so when i think about comfort zones what<br>do i mean well actually comfort zones<br>probably aren't the right term because<br>research isn't a particularly<br>comfortable place to be i've found in<br>the years that i've been doing it so<br>what i'm going to talk about first is<br>the real life problems caused by<br>language that have been the focus of my<br>so that i started as english and<br>teaching english for academic purposes<br>here at victoria university of<br>wellington and<br>one of the main things that was the<br>concern for me when i first started in<br>the area was what is academic english<br>and how do i help my students the best<br>that i possibly can i came across this<br>quote by maxwell in 2013 that reminded<br>me that we're not born speaking academic<br>english this is something that you you<br>grow with and you learn<br>and hopefully you learn to use it as<br>much as possible so in my m.a thesis i<br>have to say<br>paul was giving me feedback on my<br>writing and said that he thought perhaps<br>i could use a bit more of my academic<br>vocabulary list in my own academic<br>writing so point well taken thanks for<br>that paul<br>so one of the main concerns to start<br>with was what vocabulary de learners<br>need for university studies and i<br>started with looking at general written<br>academic english and that was going<br>around knocking on doors around the<br>university saying what do you give<br>students to read<br>and<br>sometimes the professors would say you<br>need to go and talk to my secretary can<br>you imagine that go and talk to my<br>secretary okay so i was collecting text<br>from all over the university and what i<br>was looking for was the vocabulary that<br>occurred across subject areas so it<br>didn't matter if you were studying<br>biology biology or linguistics or<br>history or something to do with business<br>i wanted to know what was the vocabulary<br>everybody had in common and the reason<br>for that is<br>i never knew where my students would end<br>up and many students start in one<br>subject area and move right so i wanted<br>to be to do the most useful work that i<br>possibly could<br>and then that work extended to looking<br>at the vocabulary of the sciences and<br>again doesn't matter where you start<br>what language is shared across the<br>sciences<br>i then turned in my phd research to look<br>at using vocabulary and writing because<br>this is something that i often heard<br>teachers say you know i teach people<br>these words and they never use them in<br>their writing so i wanted to find out<br>what was happening there and i'd like to<br>thank maria who was listening to me one<br>day saying you know this is these are<br>the efforts that people are making in<br>order to avoid<br>using words that they're not very sure<br>about or they're trying to express<br>concepts and they haven't quite got it<br>and she said oh it's like tennis it's<br>like running around my back hand so<br>that's my weakness so what do i do to<br>make my writing stronger<br>i then i need to say that this research<br>has gone wider it's gone to denmark of<br>all places and uh<br>and sophie jacobson who's the tallest<br>person in the picture is she came to new<br>zealand she's been doing work on<br>academic written danish and she was<br>particularly interested in the<br>vocabulary which is high frequency so<br>the words that occur very often in<br>english but have an academic memory<br>i've also recently looked with with a<br>couple of lockdown ma students it's not<br>that i locked them down but you know we<br>were locked down<br>and we looked at indonesian english as a<br>foreign language textbooks<br>and chinese english as a foreign<br>language textbooks to say teachers are<br>using these textbooks to prepare<br>universities to prepare students for<br>university studies are they any good for<br>that purpose and the answer was<br>no<br>anyway carry on<br>so<br>wordler has jennifer mentioned wordless<br>than some of the work that i've done and<br>i've developed quite a few i have to say<br>more than i ever thought so the academic<br>word list was the starting point we now<br>have the academic spoken word list one<br>of my phd colleagues our phd students<br>ian dang developed the academic spoken<br>word list what we've been doing with<br>these lists is then investigating<br>different kinds of texts for example<br>what's the nature of the vocabulary in<br>different subject areas<br>and just recently we finished a project<br>on looking at the vocabulary of<br>tutorials and laboratory sessions so<br>what we wanted to do was to look at the<br>talk that was happening not the text but<br>what was happening with the talk<br>and<br>we ended up doing a fairly large scale<br>study that got a bit complicated but<br>what we did was started with a corpus or<br>a body of text and looked at the<br>vocabulary there and the multi-word<br>units there and then we went to the<br>textbooks that people were using to<br>prepare people for these academic spoken<br>events and found that there was not much<br>connected between those things so again<br>we found that the textbooks didn't<br>really do a very good job so part of my<br>work is to try and inform textbook<br>development textbook writing to try and<br>help<br>you might be surprised to find out that<br>one of the textbooks suggested that blah<br>blah blah was a really useful academic<br>phrase that people should use and<br>probably actually right and another one<br>was you're kidding can you imagine<br>somebody saying that to you an election<br>anyway so we we had fun with the<br>research and then other work on<br>multi-word units so not just single<br>words but with multi-word units like on<br>the basis of or on the other hand for<br>example so trying to look wider at wider<br>groups of words or word strings<br>what we found in that research is that<br>you have to kiss a lot of frogs before<br>you find a handsome prince so you have<br>to work really hard to find these items<br>occurring again and again in text which<br>means it's difficult because<br>you can't say that they occur very often<br>so learners aren't seeing them very<br>often it makes it hard<br>now<br>most recently we've been looking at<br>academic collocations such as wide<br>ranging and trying to work out how we<br>can evaluate lists of multi-word units<br>which is a bit technical but what we're<br>saying is if you make a word list how do<br>you find out if it's any bloody good and<br>we're following poor nations framework<br>for that<br>so i started off with university<br>students and i remember thinking the<br>thing about today's university students<br>is that they are yesterday's secondary<br>school students so i then moved the<br>research into the secondary school<br>context because you can't complain about<br>people and you don't know where they've<br>come from<br>so<br>this research again looking at textbooks<br>and uh that are used in schools and then<br>english literatures things like the<br>plays and the movies and the the<br>literature that people read in new<br>zealand secondary schools the most<br>interesting thing about that research to<br>start with was i thought well<br>i know some teachers but i don't want to<br>worry them i'll phone the librarian so i<br>called around a couple of librarians in<br>new zealand secondary schools and i said<br>what does everybody read what do they<br>listen to<br>and to a person they said actually we're<br>not very sure when you find out can you<br>tell us please i was like okay all right<br>i can do that it's not the answer you<br>expect from a librarian<br>okay<br>and then moved on to look at growth of<br>academic vocabulary knowledge in new<br>zealand secondary schools and this was a<br>larger scale ministry of education<br>project<br>the exciting thing for me is that the<br>students who had done primary gone<br>through the primary school system in uh<br>in today or maori they were the ones at<br>uh in the english medium<br>secondary schools who made the most<br>progress of learning academic vocabulary<br>they were just amazing they just<br>sang and same with pacifica speakers of<br>english as well so they were streets<br>ahead of other people<br>this project has now gone into norwegian<br>secondary schools for example so again<br>looking at the growth of knowledge of<br>academic vocabulary because we're not<br>nobody's a native speaker of this we all<br>have to learn it<br>i've also worked on an international<br>school project in germany international<br>schools the people who are in your class<br>today are not the people in the class<br>tomorrow people get posted in different<br>places kids appear and disappear in<br>different way in different ways not<br>nasty mean ways but you know they might<br>not be there tomorrow they might come<br>from all over the world so<br>um in this research we were looking at<br>the the vocabulary that um<br>students<br>hear when they're in the classroom so<br>what are their teachers talking about<br>across three subject areas again the<br>sciences are off the charts in terms of<br>the language that gets used it's much<br>more difficult than other subject areas<br>and then looking to see how vocabulary<br>knowledge grows and then looking again<br>at textbooks in that space so really<br>just trying to find out much more about<br>what happens in schools<br>and then finally here's jennifer greene<br>my co-author of a book on<br>subject-specific vocabulary so that's<br>saying if students are coming in to do<br>into the maths classroom and then going<br>into a science classroom and then<br>studying health what's the vocabulary<br>they need in all of those subject areas<br>so that work um<br>has really looked if you know much about<br>the american textbook system it's it's a<br>huge area of research and they follow<br>two the texan or the californian model<br>so this kind of work really tries to<br>feed back into textbooks and textbook<br>development and if you've ever been to<br>seattle you might recognize chihuly<br>glass which is something we also visited<br>when maybe we should have been at a<br>conference in the afternoon<br>so i moved from from secondary schools<br>i'm still interested in that but i've<br>also been looking more recently at<br>vocabulary for specific purposes because<br>i'm trying to move from within just<br>within the university context that's<br>enormously important but there are many<br>more people out there doing different<br>kinds of learning<br>so vocabulary for specific purposes for<br>example one of my phd candidates was<br>studying traditional chinese medicine<br>and<br>you might be concerned for example if<br>you needed to find out about your<br>rebellious liberty<br>um so some of the things we found out<br>about this research is that you as you<br>can see you have words in english<br>co-occurring with words in chinese<br>you've got a lot of technical medical<br>vocabulary and there is a lot to learn<br>about what damp heat might mean for<br>example so you<br>people have to develop this kind of<br>knowledge and we've also been looking at<br>how learners understand and develop<br>that vocabulary knowledge themselves so<br>the main hypothesis was that if you were<br>a chinese learner versus a non-chinese<br>speaking learner you might have an<br>advantage<br>no<br>as people develop their vocabulary as<br>they develop their specialized knowledge<br>of the area they develop their academic<br>language and their specialised language<br>this is something paul talked about<br>years ago and i remember going yeah yeah<br>yeah i didn't get it until we did that<br>work<br>we've just recently been doing some work<br>on rugby and this is stuart benson's<br>work so the thing about rugby that's<br>really interesting is that it's you<br>learn it through speaking you don't<br>learn it through reading things<br>and when you're learning about speaking<br>you're actually playing a game at the<br>same time<br>it's reasonably dangerous you need to<br>know what you're doing and you need to<br>understand what people are saying as<br>much as you need to be able to<br>communicate what it is that you're going<br>to be doing as well<br>now i've learned about fat man's alley<br>from maria's family<br>we didn't find any evidence on the<br>corpus for that but it is the best term<br>ever<br>okay a little bit more jenny drayton<br>you're in the audience so your work's<br>coming up so we've also been looking at<br>medical meanings with everyday words so<br>patient in medical<br>context versus patient and everyday<br>contexts and then in aviation jenny i'm<br>not sure where you are but she's been<br>talking to me about aviation language<br>for a while now and we've finally<br>figured a few things out<br>one of the uh that this example gives<br>you an idea of the kinds of language<br>that's being used in this space and the<br>reason why jenny wanted to do this work<br>is because she's been trying to teach<br>people<br>to<br>use aviation language but the problem is<br>there's no manual as to what to do in<br>emergencies<br>but scary eh okay good<br>so<br>part of what i wanted to do as well<br>tonight is to talk about vocabulary<br>knowledge so i've already said it grows<br>right<br>so i've been looking as well at what<br>happens with<br>not just language learners but what<br>about their teachers so how big are<br>their vocabularies and what sort of<br>vocabulary do they have just recently<br>carried out a study in iceland and to be<br>completely honest icelandic teachers<br>that we tested their vocabulary sizes<br>off the hook they are extraordinary and<br>they're extraordinary for several<br>reasons the first is they're all<br>literature specialists so they're doing<br>it because they love it right and they<br>live and they breathe and they get this<br>language so they're really excited by<br>english it's great to be in a room with<br>people who are really keen on the job<br>that they do<br>we've done uh if if i was icelandic my<br>name would be doug's daughter so i'll<br>put that there for you just so you know<br>and some recent work also in indonesia<br>and one of the things we found out with<br>the indonesian teachers is that the<br>closer they are to the training that<br>they do to be an english teacher the<br>better their language skills so the<br>longer they're away from their training<br>and out teaching english<br>their english language skills<br>deteriorate and that makes sense because<br>they're not using the language beyond<br>teaching you know open your books and do<br>your things so we need to do more to try<br>and help people in these spaces because<br>that's not a comfortable place to be<br>right<br>some of the other work we've done i<br>don't know if olly balance is here but<br>we've worked at for example different<br>resources that you need for<br>doing different tasks in english so<br>what vocabulary do you need to<br>understand ted talks are ted talks<br>useful for learning english for academic<br>purposes these kinds of questions what<br>about<br>handouts that teachers give to students<br>and what we've found in this research is<br>that if you've got a difficult textbook<br>and you've got easy teacher talk<br>teacher handouts are in the middle they<br>really try and bridge difficult language<br>and easy language it's a really<br>interesting space but trying to get<br>handouts off teachers is probably one of<br>the most difficult things i've ever seen<br>it's kind of like getting a phd thesis<br>off a student give me<br>good mood neither please<br>give me<br>and we've also done some work on rap and<br>the vocabulary you need to actually<br>understand<br>you need a good size vocabulary for that<br>so don't put down people who love rap<br>music their vocabulary is probably going<br>to be bigger than yours<br>okay<br>just recently we've done some work on<br>the vocabulary that learners know<br>stay with me and that teachers think<br>that they think t learners know<br>right so do these things match up<br>so if the learners say i know this are<br>the teachers going to think the same<br>thing the answer is<br>sometimes<br>and the people who grew up in the same<br>education system are much better at<br>knowing<br>what learners will know so the further<br>you are from an education system if<br>you're teaching in an area in a country<br>and you didn't grow up there in the same<br>education system you're not going to<br>know it as well as people who come in<br>from overseas for example<br>so this is just a bit of a taster of the<br>sorts of work that we've been doing<br>i've also worked on how learners can<br>learn vocabulary because there's no<br>point saying well you know if you if you<br>listen to ted talks that's great but<br>this is the knowledge you need without<br>actually trying to help them in some way<br>so we've looked for example at using a<br>corpus which is a body of text and<br>getting people to school up on how to<br>use a corpus so that they can see<br>language and use real examples of<br>language and use<br>and we've done some work with online<br>resources so tuibui who's now down in<br>lincoln this is her picture here what<br>she did is is trained a whole lot of<br>learners up on how to use these<br>different kinds of tools and what we've<br>recently found is that even if they<br>looked something up<br>using a corpus tool for example they<br>looked something up online actually they<br>they then start to use those terms in<br>their writing so it actually has an<br>effect and has an impact on what they're<br>doing which is great to see because it's<br>not just disappearing the language<br>doesn't just disappear but it takes a<br>lot of effort to do this<br>we've looked at common textbook<br>exercises and found out that they're not<br>great i'll move on<br>and<br>uh<br>haiti thompson the reason why we're<br>looking quite formal there is she had to<br>provide evidence that she was here<br>visiting me in from japan in new zealand<br>that we were having a meeting so this is<br>us<br>having a meeting<br>so<br>she what she did is set up fluency<br>workshops to try and help her japanese<br>learners become more fluent in english<br>and if you're interested in her work she<br>did a really fantastic job and again it<br>just it takes<br>research takes good ideas so these are<br>all examples of very very good ideas<br>okay<br>i want to tell you finally about<br>vocabulary size<br>and testing people's vocabulary size the<br>reason why i'm smiling is because this<br>was a small idea that's just got bigger<br>and bigger and bigger so we've got work<br>on first language speakers of english<br>and paul very much drove this work which<br>is looking at the quality and the types<br>of research that's gone into trying to<br>find out how many words people know<br>and the problem is that in the<br>literature the estimates go from you<br>know way over here to way over here and<br>it's all a bit not random but it's a bit<br>tricky uh we have a colleague in wales<br>who is currently developing a vocabulary<br>size test based on five words<br>just to tell you about the sort of size<br>and scale of the kind of projects so<br>we took the vocabulary science test into<br>new zealand secondary schools and did a<br>lot of work there and if you i think any<br>anybody any researcher should do work in<br>schools because teachers are amazing and<br>students are amazing too we had a great<br>time in schools we learned a lot and<br>we've done a lot of work on second<br>language speakers of english and looking<br>at bilingual tests for example betsy<br>kira did work on that and irina algort<br>has been leading the way in that space<br>too<br>i wanted to tell you very briefly about<br>one of the projects with the going into<br>secondary schools which was<br>trying to trying to find out what<br>happens when students take one version<br>of the test in a group and they take<br>another version of the test as<br>individuals sitting with a researcher<br>right so the purpose of the researcher<br>being there is just keep them going keep<br>them you know keep them motivated keep<br>them going in the task and what we found<br>is that for the highest scoring students<br>it didn't matter if they had somebody<br>sitting next to them or if they're in a<br>big group nobody cares they scored well<br>right<br>but for the people who scored lowest in<br>the test if they had somebody sitting<br>next to them keeping them engaged keep<br>them on task they scored much better<br>than if they sat in groups<br>now<br>how do we test people in new zealand<br>secondary schools how do we test people<br>in new zealand universities we're in big<br>groups<br>imagine what's that what that what<br>that's what that's like for people who<br>are going to score really poorly so one<br>of the things that i'd like us to do is<br>to do more work with it lower you know<br>people who are going to school poorly we<br>could just sit there's as simple as<br>sitting next to them just keeping them<br>going<br>and they'll really do better<br>okay<br>we've also been developing pseudo words<br>for testing because one of the problems<br>when you test vocabulary is you might<br>accidentally test them on a word that<br>they already know<br>and you didn't mean to to do that right<br>and i'll talk a little bit about this in<br>a minute<br>but um these pseudo words that have been<br>developed we can now<br>develop pseudo words or fake words in<br>any language as long as there's a<br>sufficient body of text in that language<br>the second thing is we can now develop<br>pseudo words that look like technical<br>words in english<br>and<br>seriously you look at them and you think<br>well yeah that could be a word and<br>that's the whole point right because you<br>don't want people<br>guessing is the key point about that<br>okay<br>if you want to take the vocabulary<br>science test please do<br>so just to give you an idea of how<br>paul's work has has really<br>helped us in this way so on the left<br>hand side you've got high frequency<br>words in the first and second thousand<br>words of english on the far right you've<br>got words that are in seven thousand<br>eight thousand so as you go along you<br>can see that you get words that get<br>they're not as frequent as the words in<br>the one to two thousand does that make<br>sense so he is going to be more frequent<br>than ploy for example okay<br>so one of the tricks with this test is<br>to sample<br>and we've got<br>john reed is an expert in testing and<br>he'll be can have a bit to say about<br>this test as well it's great to have you<br>here john<br>so here we go we're going further down<br>the frequency<br>ladder<br>through to words at 15 16 000<br>so i'm hopeful that at this point you're<br>starting to say yeah okay there are<br>words that i recognize here but i<br>wouldn't necessarily use them<br>and then the ones that everybody really<br>wants to see<br>but i'm assuming it's a noun<br>be a very odd verb<br>so one of the joys about doing this<br>research has been talking with test<br>takers after they've taken the test so<br>it's a multi<br>what is it<br>multiple choice test right<br>so here's a quote from somebody a first<br>language speaker who took the test and<br>it's in the early days and she said yeah<br>this feels like<br>things are getting triggered way down<br>deep in your memory deep in your memory<br>glenn she said it's really hard not to<br>say memory gland at that point deep in<br>your memory gland it's like looking for<br>something at the bottom of your handbag<br>and then somebody else who was a second<br>language speaker who may be in this room<br>said i was saying so how did you choose<br>these words he said yeah roller king<br>no<br>but it sounded like rock and roll so i<br>chose the last one spot on gobbet and he<br>said sounds disgusting i chose<br>spot on<br>and the reason why we talk about the<br>slumdog millionaire effect and this is<br>something paul talks about regularly<br>with vocabulary sizes you never know<br>what people will know it's a it's<br>amazing what happens with people's<br>vocabulary size and knowledge so<br>in slumdog millionaire or in the in the<br>book q and a<br>the a man's answering quiz questions<br>based on what's happened to him<br>throughout his life and vocabulary<br>science testing is very much like that<br>too<br>and if you sit and say to somebody so<br>how did you learn that word it's amazing<br>what people remember about the<br>vocabulary that they learned<br>who at the time and i've often talked<br>with learners and they'll say<br>you taught me that word and i think no<br>don't i oh yeah okay<br>is that me okay all right<br>so<br>if i reflect on the vocabulary science<br>testing research<br>we've found that just like noses and<br>ears as you get older your vocabulary<br>grows that's the that's the good news<br>um i've learned that people who think<br>they have a larger vocabulary will come<br>and take a test<br>but what that means is people who don't<br>think they have a large vocabulary will<br>not come and take a test<br>i've learned that<br>when you set up a research project for<br>first-year students that you should<br>probably specify how old they are the<br>first person through the door was the<br>new 40s<br>so that means you can't really compare<br>right it makes it very difficult<br>i've learnt that you are what you read<br>so paul was interviewing a student he<br>scored really well on the vocabulary<br>size test he was in a new zealand<br>secondary school<br>and paul said so you're reading much he<br>said yeah mostly quantum physics just at<br>the moment people are amazing<br>and i learned through julie by the way<br>who's here tonight about what happens<br>when people play mmorpg games their<br>vocabulary sizes are astronomical and<br>unfortunately language learners not very<br>not language teachers are not very happy<br>about that so what happens with these<br>massive online role-playing games is<br>there's high pressure there's a lot of<br>interaction there's a lot of language<br>you have to use the language to play and<br>to work with other people to achieve<br>goals and do those things so actually<br>people's vocabulary size<br>is really amazing and i talked with a<br>group of malaysian students and said you<br>guys i'm really impressed with your<br>vocabulary signs what's the secret and<br>they all did this and i thought oh this<br>isn't going to be good and they start<br>looking at their feet<br>do i keep asking the question i thought<br>no no it's okay you can tell me what is<br>it and they said oh we play online<br>role-playing games<br>and we know that this is good for us<br>because we know that we know words that<br>our classmates don't and julie when she<br>interviewed people<br>somebody said look in my language class<br>i can look away but when i'm playing<br>these games i can't look away from the<br>screen so they're so engaging<br>okay<br>so you might have noticed a couple of<br>things about this work one is that<br>there's a strong focus on teaching and<br>learning<br>there's a commitment to being of this<br>place and i remember the moment where i<br>thought i'm just going to start doing<br>research in new zealand because this is<br>where i<br>this is me this is who i am this is<br>where i come from so i've moved<br>definitely to be doing that work and<br>that this work has also gone beyond<br>these shores<br>and it's highly collaborative with<br>undergraduate students postgraduate<br>students colleagues with people overseas<br>people here in new zealand so i have a<br>very privileged time in my job and i<br>know that and i appreciate it<br>so it's time to sail in new directions<br>and i know there might be people in the<br>you can do it<br>i can do it you can do it<br>so i wanted to talk about the language<br>and trades education project or latte<br>project and apparently that's my<br>nickname for it i never knew that but<br>it's a good one<br>okay<br>so when i think about this project i<br>think about our dad doug who used to say<br>when you bite off more than you can chew<br>chew like buggery<br>he was right<br>and what you need to know is that<br>statements like that from dad were often<br>followed by another one by our lovely<br>mother bev are you used to saying<br>so that the lantern project um was based<br>and<br>it was across weltec which is a local<br>polytechnic victoria university of<br>wellington and sponsored also by ako<br>aterua and what we were trying to do was<br>to describe trades language and to<br>support the learning of trades language<br>and we<br>quite honestly thought yeah that's<br>doable<br>oh give that a we'll give that a<br>shot we'll give it a nudge see where we<br>get to<br>so why would you care so first of all<br>this this there's a strong<br>um connection between language and<br>identity so in order to be part of a<br>group you need to speak the language of<br>the group and for for builders this<br>means for example being able to follow<br>explanations be able to talk to people<br>talk through key concepts and use<br>technical terms correctly it's really<br>key that you do that so it's not it's<br>not just academic language that this is<br>for it's also true in trades language<br>and as you grow<br>your vocabulary knowledge in a field it<br>it's always you're developing your<br>expertise right<br>and here's one of the well-tech<br>carpenter tutors and he said builders<br>have their own sort of language<br>i try and get the guys everybody's a guy<br>doesn't matter everybody's a guy to talk<br>to me in that sort of language so it's<br>all about the size of the nails the size<br>of the timber the greater the timber the<br>treatment of the timber so with you know<br>if you've grown up in the family like<br>ours you'd know a little bit about that<br>right so you know<br>um but you might not know as much as<br>other people do<br>so one of the challenges for me was i<br>knew a little bit about trades language<br>but actually it's a lot more complex<br>and<br>call for a lot of work bless you so<br>what about the trades learners what did<br>they think and here's kane one of the<br>second-year automotive electric students<br>and he said there's no other name for a<br>transistor and he doesn't mean radio<br>there's no other name for a transistor<br>so you need to know the exact name or<br>you'll be saying that's witchy thing<br>which is not cool you know this is not<br>what you do<br>and<br>um you might think the vocabulary is<br>familiar but is it really so do you know<br>how to use this in context so you only<br>get one shot before you slip doesn't<br>sound good if you slip and strip the<br>head of the screw i have no clue but i i<br>know that this is not good<br>if this happens<br>now early on in the project one of the<br>things that we found<br>is that it was a bit difficult to<br>publish the research and the reason for<br>that is because there are lots of<br>questions coming back from the journals<br>like this<br>what else is there in the field already<br>nothing that's that's the point so we<br>couldn't talk about other research<br>because there was there's nothing right<br>so<br>okay we need to be clear about that<br>where's your theoretical framework<br>yeah uh<br>how does language fit into the trades<br>how does it not okay so we need to<br>rethink the way that we're explaining<br>this because clearly it's not making any<br>sense<br>is it this or this um<br>yep is it that yep and that yeah it's<br>that too<br>so it was a bit hard to find our space i<br>think to start with<br>one of the things we did in the project<br>was we tried to collect text that<br>students read and the text that students<br>write as well and it was tricky so you<br>ask the question what do they read so<br>they get they get pedagogical texts and<br>legal texts all kinds of things to read<br>so what we ended up with was what the<br>teachers gave the students to read we<br>just wanted that okay<br>and it turns out it was a lot more<br>complex than we thought<br>gathering these kinds of texts but we<br>got there and then the question was what<br>did they write well the answer is<br>actually one of the well-tech carpenters<br>tutors said well i joined the trades to<br>use my hands and not for writing if you<br>know what i mean so the answer was not<br>much<br>we ended up collecting builders diaries<br>which was<br>because you can't say oh we did this big<br>study but they don't write anything so<br>just you know this but over here is more<br>important<br>we also collected tutor talk<br>and this was an unexpected pleasure for<br>several ways so we mic'd up tutors<br>because<br>otherwise you'd end up chasing them<br>around all day saying can you please put<br>this on so we had to do a lot of<br>remembering to turn the recorder on and<br>then remembering to turn it off<br>sometimes there were just long periods<br>of silence because<br>something had happened and we didn't<br>know what or students were doing<br>something<br>this was the noisiest project i've ever<br>been involved in so when on the good<br>days for people who are out on building<br>sites right they're carpenters and our<br>plumbers so they're building things it's<br>astonishingly noisy and it's very<br>difficult to<br>hear in order to transcribe this work<br>and then<br>when it was raining everybody was inside<br>in theory classes and you knew that<br>everybody hated being in theory classes<br>the tutors and the students hated being<br>in theory classes so really this was we<br>took what we got i have to say and<br>another thing that people often said was<br>um<br>oh you needed to be more rigorous about<br>making sure you had balances between<br>this and this and that it's like have<br>you ever tried to collect spoken data<br>you know have a bit of sympathy here<br>folks<br>so the joys of transcribing what we<br>found with transcription is that we<br>moved this is classroom language in a<br>way so you move from giving instructions<br>and greeting people and doing things<br>straight into really highly technical<br>language so here's an example of a tutor<br>saying okay guys as i expressed<br>yesterday as part of this bracket you<br>probably don't even need to be here cool<br>you'll have to replace a core plug on<br>your cylinder head<br>it's all going on all at once so in<br>order to transcribe this we needed<br>people who actually understood what they<br>were hearing and then we needed to go<br>back to the tutors to say we think you<br>said this is do you think you said this<br>and can you listen for us because it's<br>not easy for us to pick up this language<br>one of the struggles that we've had just<br>recently when we've followed up to do it<br>on a project of trying to find out what<br>people know about high frequency<br>technical words is that<br>this this vocabulary<br>so what happens is you can get a<br>technical word on its own or it can be a<br>technical word because it combines with<br>another word to make a technical term<br>does that make sense so jenny drayton<br>who's here um was interviewing some of<br>the trades tutors to find out if the<br>work that we'd be doing was any good and<br>what they found was that we were<br>choosing the wrong pictures to put into<br>a test because we had the wrong trade<br>and the wrong thing if that makes sense<br>right<br>so here he is saying here's one of the<br>tutors saying some of these things are<br>transferable across across trade so a<br>spanner is a spanner that's fine<br>but a lot of things are trade specific<br>even if they do the same thing so a<br>spark plug and an ignition probe both do<br>the same thing they create a spark<br>they're made of similar materials but<br>they're completely different so you<br>can't test people with the same picture<br>because they won't<br>necessarily recognize it right<br>so that was really clear that actually<br>where we'd started with the project that<br>we didn't want to bother the tutors<br>until we'd developed something that was<br>wrong we should have done has gone to<br>the tutor straight away and then we<br>wouldn't have had that particular<br>problem<br>now one of the things about this project<br>is you get to find out more about the<br>nature of your own teaching when you<br>find<br>out what other teachers do in class so<br>teaching trades doesn't look like<br>teaching tesol teaching english to<br>speakers of other languages so here's a<br>tutor he's setting things up and he's<br>saying okay<br>what do we know so if i hit this in<br>what's going to happen so it's all here<br>and now so that the students are<br>listening it's really intense they're<br>not writing anything down they have to<br>follow everything that's happening<br>and every teacher in this room will have<br>experienced this moment at some point so<br>what's going to happen if i hit it<br>straight in it's going to cone in am i<br>able to get it out no so what do i want<br>to do twist it i'm going to one side<br>what am i going to hit is it the center<br>is it the outside to the outside and<br>then he says these fatal words watch it<br>not work for me today after i've already<br>done one every teacher in the room goes<br>oh i know what's going to come next<br>so there's hammering that's not normal<br>in an english language class<br>the shooter says if i eye the<br>screwdriver and i'm thinking what if i<br>either screwdriver it does work better<br>well that's good news then you've got to<br>check right what does that actually mean<br>and then he said so he obviously goes<br>over to start doing another one and he<br>goes twist it out and it comes out yep<br>good now it's in there<br>it should have come out and then he says<br>do you know it's a lot easier to do this<br>on friday when i did this<br>so i have a lot a lot of um empathy for<br>this kind of event in a language class<br>but i don't think i would have ever said<br>a word like this i've been reassured<br>that that word's been heard in this room<br>before<br>possibly not during an inaugural lecture<br>um something else that came up was that<br>was the joy of hearing teachers teach<br>and seeing how listening to how they<br>work through things and and get learners<br>involved so here i have an automotive<br>technology tutor and what they're doing<br>is working through a fault analysis so<br>the student comes up to the front of the<br>room and they talk it through and<br>everybody else in the room is listening<br>and watching right and there is a<br>significance of the pie<br>the automotive technology word list<br>which is something that we developed as<br>part of the project the key the words<br>are all highlighted there for you so the<br>tutor starts talking it through so you<br>can see there the current flow path that<br>our switches and regulator are up the<br>current flow goes through a warning<br>light and the switch on the right side<br>and then down to ground but ground<br>doesn't mean ground right<br>so there's current flow through our<br>ignition switch top contacts through the<br>rotor and down to ground so we've got a<br>problem<br>and then he sets up the problem so if we<br>stood here with our key on injured off<br>and went to the shop and got a pie came<br>back ate the pie what's most likely to<br>occur<br>i've got brothers going i know it's<br>gonna burn out what's it about it's<br>going to burn up it's going to burn out<br>the rotor<br>cool<br>so i i really enjoyed this project<br>because it stopped me and my tracks<br>about what teachers do and how we work<br>with language and how we've got all of<br>this good things going on<br>so i learned a lot<br>about vocabulary in trades education i<br>learned that one word is technic one<br>word and three is technical and written<br>trades text<br>and if you've done most of your learning<br>through listening<br>one word and ten is technical and spoken<br>trades text in other words<br>the written language is far more<br>technical than the spoken language most<br>people are learning through the spoken<br>language so no wonder the written text<br>can be highly problematic<br>i learned that if you ask tutors who<br>teach first-year students versus tutors<br>who teach second-year students about<br>technical vocabulary they do not agree<br>and we should not expect that<br>i've had a lot of pushback from academic<br>publishers of journal articles saying<br>that there's no agreement between these<br>people about what's technical i have to<br>say<br>that's the point<br>i know now that there are many efl<br>englishes for foreign language teachers<br>who come to conferences and come to<br>talks like mine and come up afterwards<br>and say thank god somebody's doing some<br>work in this space because we have no<br>idea what we're doing and there are many<br>more of those people than those who are<br>required to teach english for dog<br>grooming<br>which is<br>true<br>uh we're now we've been working on<br>testing vocabulary knowledge of words<br>like line as in line a wall and<br>carpentry<br>and drive and automotive technology so<br>there's more work going on in the space<br>and if covert hadn't happened we would<br>have been to tonga and back several<br>times by now<br>so<br>i want to finish up by talking about uh<br>one more time when i've sailed in a<br>and learnt things that i didn't think<br>i'd ever learn about myself and i want<br>to talk about a project where we took<br>the<br>technical wordless from the latte<br>project and for trades and we use a<br>research methodology called talanawa so<br>what i've found out about myself is that<br>i am a very pakiha pakeha so i want to<br>talk about this here today so tala noah<br>draws on an indigenous polynesian world<br>view so this research and there'll be<br>people in the room who know about this<br>it's conversation and context based<br>and it's really about the mutual<br>relationship it's about trust and<br>connection and face-to-face<br>communication between researchers and<br>participants and to me it's things of<br>whakafa natanga so that's establishing<br>relationships and getting to know each<br>other now<br>i'm the baby of seven<br>i come from a small village<br>i thought i knew a little bit about<br>establishing relationships and doing<br>things with people<br>it turns out that i needed to learn a<br>lot and i'm glad that i have<br>so an important part of this research<br>was this idea of developing a kakala so<br>a garland and that's so therefore the<br>for the research this is a metaphor so<br>you do your tully where you're selecting<br>your leaves and your flowers and then<br>you weave that's the tui part and then<br>you you you create the kakalad you<br>create the research and then you give it<br>away you give it back<br>to the to the um to the wearer and<br>that's a signal of love and reciprocity<br>so in this project<br>we had our technical word lists in<br>english we wanted them in tongan<br>so we used the research that we'd<br>already done<br>and then we needed to do some<br>translation work and we had trades<br>experts who needed to be speakers of<br>tongan<br>and experts in their trades here in<br>wellington and we also engaged<br>education experts in tonga to do this<br>work as well with us because there's no<br>point doing something if people aren't<br>we had interesting research meetings so<br>kiko who was our<br>colleague in this space kiko used to<br>come in and he'd say<br>g'day and i'd say good day and i'd say<br>how's your research going and he'd say<br>yep we all had dinner last night<br>together<br>and i'd go yep good tell me about the<br>research how are you doing with the<br>transfer you know but we had dinner last<br>night<br>okay good<br>week three kiko g'day how are you<br>getting on how's the research happening<br>so yeah we were all at church<br>on sunday<br>good it took me to week eight to realise<br>that what i needed to do was to say kiko<br>good to see you let's go and have lunch<br>and talk about everything else but not<br>the research project<br>because you don't know me very well i<br>don't know you very well so if there's<br>no trust here<br>what are we doing<br>so<br>i hope i got there in the end but he did<br>say to me in week 11 i think you're<br>learning something<br>so<br>as part of the tui and the the weaving<br>that we did we found for example that<br>there are words technical words that<br>have been tonganized so you don't have<br>to speak tongan's recognize some of<br>those words<br>we found that there were words that have<br>a one-on-one technical translation which<br>is fabulous news if you're a language<br>teacher because it means people have got<br>it already they just need the english<br>word or if you're learning the tongan<br>you've got it in english all you need is<br>the tongan word you've understand<br>understood the concept we found words<br>which have multiple words in english but<br>there's one word in tongan and that's<br>not a deficit thing that's just part of<br>understanding that there are different<br>ways of expressing something<br>and for example we use three words in<br>english where one word in tongan will do<br>and we found technical words that need a<br>full translation so<br>in effluent if you put it into tongan<br>has a full translation there and if it's<br>translated back into english you get<br>dirty water drain out okay makes sense<br>right<br>now when it came to giving this research<br>back this is the first time i've ever<br>worked in a research project where the<br>first thing that was talked about was<br>churches<br>so here's kiko<br>bernie this is kiko and the booklets<br>we thought that it would be a name of a<br>really good band so<br>so we<br>and and and kiko was very clear what we<br>need is paper-based but nobody's looking<br>online in this community this is not the<br>space we need to publish if you're going<br>to publish something it needs to be<br>something that they can hold and is<br>theirs<br>again we needed all of these networks so<br>normally in my research i go to<br>conferences and i talk to people i don't<br>i'm not in churches talking to people<br>very often and i'm certainly not talking<br>about trades-based research in them if i<br>am<br>we needed a lot of time and we needed<br>collaboration and family time<br>and for me to understand that there will<br>be feedback for example why didn't you<br>do this in siri omari why didn't you do<br>this in samoan these are all very good<br>questions<br>and we've also had people adding to the<br>list so you know we made these lists in<br>principled ways and they decided that<br>actually no i'm adding to it and to be<br>honest i'm happy about that i don't care<br>they're using them i i think that's<br>great<br>and giving talks like this<br>is also part of that giving back to the<br>community so i'd really like to thank<br>kiko he introduces himself as the summer<br>scholars but i mean even never leaving<br>school he always says i'm the summer<br>scholar because even in 2021 we were<br>still doing work together on this work<br>so<br>in moving outside my comfort zones i've<br>learned a lot about my own cultural<br>background not as a negative way but<br>understanding that it has a major effect<br>on the work that i do and how i work<br>with other people<br>i've learned that learning about<br>research in other contexts actually<br>means a lot to me and to other people as<br>well i hadn't realized the emotional<br>connection that i would make and i've<br>also learned to talk more directly about<br>my research and maria is the one who<br>pointed out to me that i'm constantly<br>talking about other people's research<br>why don't i ever talk about my own<br>and janet holmes made the same point<br>i think that there are implications more<br>generally about what happens when you go<br>into schools and what happens when you<br>go into the community to do more work in<br>those spaces and giving back and what i<br>really want to say is there's just so<br>much more to do and learn i'm so excited<br>about this work<br>now<br>you've been very kind and you've been<br>with me all of this time and i have to<br>say that i know that i think when i talk<br>about applied linguistics i look like<br>this<br>but i'm totally aware that probably<br>probably<br>i look a lot more like that<br>so<br>it's it's an honor to be a professor and<br>it's an honour to be a professor who<br>looks like this as well as much as<br>anything else so<br>thank you so much for your attention<br>tonight thank you so much for being here<br>and i'd like to hand over now to simon<br>it's your job now<br>i'm simon mckenzie i am a professor of<br>criminology in the faculty of humanities<br>and social sciences and i'm the acting<br>dean at the moment and so i get the<br>great pleasure and privilege of<br>proposing on behalf of all of us a vote<br>of thanks to professor avril coxhead<br>for her inaugural lecture as professor<br>in appliant linguistics at te haranga<br>walker<br>abral is famous<br>for bringing the laughs<br>and this is how somebody put it to me<br>fairly recently they said she makes<br>everybody relax and she brings the<br>laughs<br>and<br>i think she might have been having a bit<br>of a laugh<br>at our expense tonight because i did not<br>recognize one single word in that final<br>column<br>of the vocabulary test<br>never mind winter<br>squinny<br>squinny come on<br>um<br>i think we need to look a bit more<br>closely into this in fact i did look a<br>bit more closely into this i wrote these<br>two down<br>squinny and wintle i've got a bit here<br>that says note yourself red lines from<br>microsoft spell checker under squinny<br>and wintel even the computer does not<br>uh it takes a very smart person to take<br>people back to school<br>in a room like this and to do in such a<br>nice and funny way as a rare skill<br>indeed i think we'll start a challenge<br>in the faculty office to see if we can<br>use each of those words in our email<br>correspondence with staff over the<br>coming month<br>further note to self just googled<br>squinny it turns out it is real<br>idea for next faculty email<br>pay free's imminent don't be as squinty<br>um one of the things that you realize<br>quite early on as a university lecturer<br>is that if you want to<br>teach people you need to grab them you<br>need to engage them when you need to<br>to get their emotional their mental<br>attention<br>and even if you get them then you can<br>teach them but if you if you don't got<br>them then it's going to be an uphill<br>struggle<br>and i'm sure we've all been there and i<br>think april's just given us a master<br>class tonight and how to do that how to<br>get people how to get how to um i feel<br>like i've been got<br>um what a joy to be a part of it to be<br>swept along like that<br>and the result is that she's educated us<br>i know about squinnies and i know about<br>wintles and lattes<br>and a whole lot else besides i was<br>digging around in april's back catalog<br>of papers and i came across<br>um the very article that she talked<br>about in relation to the aviation study<br>which is called plain language or<br>anything but<br>in the journal of aviation<br>aerospace education and research and at<br>the time i thought<br>well that's a pretty cool journal for um<br>a linguist to be in unexpected because<br>surely<br>aviation slash aerospace research is<br>like how to build a jet engine or<br>can i print 91 and instead of 95 if<br>you're a cheapo like me will it still<br>work but no<br>um in the faculty of humanities and<br>social sciences we get into all of the<br>interesting academic nukes and crannies<br>and aerospace linguistics is one of them<br>so<br>i'm going to do that thing now where i<br>try and summarize somebody else's paper<br>and i won't get it right but but i can<br>tell you at least what i took from it<br>there are<br>two schools of thought in relation to<br>what you should do in an emergency<br>in<br>and what should we call a linguistic<br>emergency right so um so there's there's<br>people in the aircraft control towers<br>and there's the people flying the planes<br>and they're trying to speak to each<br>other<br>there's one school of thought<br>and everyone and our colleague were<br>interviewing the people in the in the<br>towers there's one school of thought<br>which is we should stick to the<br>technical jargon because this is an<br>emergency so this is no time to be<br>departing from the agreed language that<br>we speak to each other the other school<br>of thought is that um<br>in emergencies unforeseen things happen<br>and the jargon can't really be expected<br>to expand into all of these unforeseen<br>situations and so you should resort to<br>plain english you should speak in a very<br>sort of straightforward way<br>and then like like everything else<br>there's there's people in the middle um<br>who think you should sort of do a bit of<br>one and a bit of the other<br>um reading this paper had two effects on<br>me<br>firstly since i've always been a bit of<br>a nervous flyer anyway it gave me one<br>more thing to worry about because<br>what i took from it and has just been<br>confirmed i think by this lecture is<br>that there is in practice no working<br>agreement on how people should speak to<br>each other<br>in an aviation emergency<br>so not only now do you have to be<br>sitting there listening to the engine<br>noises for clunks and bunks and<br>wondering why the guy next to you is<br>sneezing uh and as he goes mask on or<br>not you've got to be thinking what's the<br>pilot going to be saying to the control<br>tower if this all goes bad<br>and and will they understand each other<br>so at moments like that i just have a<br>few deep breaths into a paper bag and<br>thank goodness that april's on the case<br>um<br>that was that was the panic attack was<br>the first effect the second effect the<br>paper had on it was that kind of light<br>bulb movement that you have when you<br>read really good academic research and<br>it just clicks and everything becomes<br>clear and you suddenly see the<br>importance of it which often as in this<br>case um comes in shining a spotlight on<br>and calling into question things that<br>have been taken for granted<br>uh we often assume that people know how<br>to talk to each other more or less<br>probably more rather than less if it's a<br>case of professionals and technical<br>jargon<br>but of course we should know better you<br>look anywhere in society or in language<br>and you see people just getting along<br>playing with rules<br>modifying them in practice interpreting<br>the world and making it at the same time<br>once you've identified that even in<br>specialist areas<br>like aviation or the trades or whatever<br>once you see the cultures of language<br>exist then the important task becomes<br>mapping their particular patterns and um<br>that's important because through that<br>understanding you can help people become<br>better communicators<br>and you can you can help people better<br>understand the communications of others<br>so i get it now avril you've educated me<br>you've educated all of us tonight how<br>clever to do it in the format of a fun<br>public lecture language explaining<br>language words about words<br>in terms of her international reputation<br>avril is a globally renowned expert in<br>applied linguistics she's also got a<br>fearsome and very widely recognized<br>reputation as a fantastic teacher i<br>didn't think i'd still be learning words<br>at this point in my life but i now<br>realized not only was i wrong<br>i have some small insight into how<br>massively wrong i was<br>and how much there still is to do which<br>is both invigorating and daunting but<br>then uh lifelong learning is a journey<br>isn't it and uh very glad that we're all<br>at vuw on that journey with you avril<br>i'm sure i've called you avril at least<br>haven't i<br>honestly i've i've known a lot of<br>avril's in my life and<br>um<br>my brain knows that it's april but my<br>face thinks something different and i<br>hear myself saying it and i think i just<br>said why don't why can't you get it<br>right and<br>the irony is not lost on me that this is<br>a a linguistics lecture and b<br>here's someone who's dedicated their<br>working life to helping people get words<br>right and to use them correctly and the<br>one word that i can't consistently get<br>right<br>yeah<br>um<br>on behalf of your university<br>and the faculty of humanities and social<br>sciences a warm and belated and covert<br>delayed uh welcome to our professoriate<br>on behalf of all of your colleagues and<br>your friends<br>and your family here tonight we are<br>delighted and honored to have you<br>as one of our scholarly thought leaders<br>in the community<br>um<br>in a minute i'm going to invite<br>everybody to<br>winter over to the common room<br>uh which is through those doors there<br>that you can see if you take a squinny<br>uh come and join us for a drink the<br>lattes tonight maybe intellectual ones<br>but the beer and wine are very real<br>uh nami hinuike let's give a big hand<br>and thanks and congratulations to<br>professor ava thompson</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
