Urban ecology recognises that because humans are the driving force in urban landscapes, influencing biodiversity in a variety of ways, a socio-ecological approach is required to understand patterns of diversity and species distributions. This presentation describes urban ecological research in New Zealand that seeks to understand the social and environmental drivers of species’ distributions, the factors influencing interactions between people and nature, as well as multi-disciplinary research designed to support conservation initiatives.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

to celebrate the<br>promotion of yolanda vance he's to<br>professor<br>and i'm delighted that we can once again<br>meet and have these inaugural<br>professorial lectures<br>sadly covert has interfered with very<br>many of the things that we hold dear<br>so these lectures are a great<br>opportunity for us to take time out of<br>our busy lives and to listen to our<br>amazing staff<br>and broaden our understanding of what<br>goes on in our university<br>so i'd like to welcome many colleagues<br>from across the university as well as<br>students and friends but i'd like to<br>give a very special welcome to yolanda's<br>friends and family who've joined us this<br>evening<br>promotion to professor<br>is not something that's easily achieved<br>at otago<br>and in order for yolanda to have been<br>promoted she's gone through a rigorous<br>process where she's had to demonstrate<br>she has achieved sustained outstanding<br>leadership in research teaching and<br>service<br>professor barker is going to formally<br>introduce yolanda in a moment but i just<br>want to say a few words to set the scene<br>yolanda has been at the university in<br>the department of zoology since 2001<br>and despite working part time she's<br>maintained a substantial teaching role<br>and played a key role in the development<br>and success of the wildlife management<br>programme<br>in research yolanda is widely recognized<br>as an expert in urban ecology even<br>invasive species and human wildlife<br>human nature relationships<br>in fact her referees talk about her<br>being the most widely known new zealand<br>conservation scientists in the us<br>she has made significant impact beyond<br>traditional publication modes<br>her work has influenced policy<br>development by the department of<br>conservation and the dunedin city<br>council<br>most notably yonanda is a leader in a<br>wide range of diversity projects<br>biodiversity projects that are making a<br>difference on the ground to the reversal<br>of biodiversity decline<br>of new zealand's indigenous flora and<br>former fauna<br>so yolanda's research is truly<br>interdisciplinary<br>and<br>she has covered a whole biological range<br>of biological aspects of biodiversity<br>conservation<br>and she's had a notable impact both in<br>academia and the wider community<br>we're very fortunate yolanda to have you<br>as part of our university<br>congratulations on your promotion and<br>i'm really looking forward to your<br>lecture<br>so i'll hand over now to richard barker<br>professor nicholson tina kwai professor<br>blakey tina<br>it is my great pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight professor<br>yolanda van hezek to give her inaugural<br>professorial lecture here at the<br>university of otago<br>as indicated by professor nicholson<br>yolanda is one of our more recent<br>additions to the professorial ranks here<br>at the university of otago having<br>received a well-deserved promotion<br>to the position in february 2019<br>covert has kept us waiting for this<br>important celebration<br>i'm going to have to wait for the pepeha<br>to find out where yolanda was born but i<br>do know that she attended queen's high<br>school here in dunedin<br>at the time the prestigious subjects at<br>queen's were in languages and the<br>classics and in order to study science<br>she had to head across to the<br>neighbouring king's high school for her<br>classes with one exception which was<br>biology which was taught at queens<br>supported by<br>what yolanda says were fantastic<br>resource kits provided by the university<br>of otago<br>yolanda refers to her tastes in animals<br>and i'm speaking metaphorically as being<br>very catholic<br>this is reflected in her publication<br>record which covers various aspects of<br>the biology of 23 different bird species<br>including six different penguin species<br>eight mammals<br>three invertebrates lizards and even one<br>tortoise<br>after completing high school the<br>university of otago beckoned and it was<br>here that she graduated first with her<br>honours degree<br>and then with her phd<br>i just found out that her first phd<br>supervisor was<br>kai westerskoff<br>but he left after a year into yolanda's<br>phd and was taken over<br>by<br>lloyd davis and i'm looking to see if i<br>can spot lloyd in the audience<br>i know lloyd's around but not here today<br>needless to say<br>this was on penguins and also needless<br>to say it included field work in<br>antarctica her topic was the study of<br>penguin diet<br>and the requisite samples were obtained<br>by inducing the penguins to vomit and<br>then sifting through the material<br>to produce to look for the diagnostic<br>remains<br>yolanda tells us that health and safety<br>rules at the time weren't quite what<br>they are today and she would sift and<br>sort her vomit samples in the same<br>office as her fellow phd students<br>she reports that at least one of the<br>students was not put off by this that<br>george phil<br>after completing her phd professor van<br>hezek<br>took on a postdoctoral fellowship also<br>on penguins at the percy fitzpatrick<br>institute of african ornithology at the<br>university of cape town in south africa<br>from there her work took her to saudi<br>arabia where she worked from 1991 until<br>2000 as a wildlife biologist at the<br>national wildlife research centre i will<br>let yolanda relate anecdotes from her<br>time there but based on the briefing<br>that she gave me this was quite<br>interesting<br>in 2001 to our good fortune yolanda<br>joined the university of otago on a 0.4<br>fte appointment to co-lead our<br>world-renowned wildlife management<br>program despite being on continuing<br>fractional appointments since that time<br>she's been an incredibly productive<br>researcher which has been recognised<br>with this promotion to professor<br>professor van hezek has published 131<br>peer-reviewed journal articles two books<br>and 13 book chapters she has received<br>significant grant funding for her work<br>including a full marsden as co-pi in<br>2013 titled natural neighborhoods for<br>city children and also as a team leader<br>on two mbie endeavor grants<br>all advancing her interest in indigenous<br>nature in urban environments<br>great research will not get you promoted<br>to professor at the university of otago<br>on its own you have to be an all-rounder<br>and yolanda is also an outstanding<br>teacher<br>she has been leading the wildlife<br>management program at otago since 2001<br>an outstanding postgraduate program that<br>is sought after by prospective students<br>from around the world who evaluations by<br>students are excellent<br>and she has also supervised 10 phds and<br>10 40 masters to completion all while on<br>a fractional appointment<br>service to the university and wider<br>community is another area in which<br>professor van heesek excels for the<br>university this includes service on our<br>animal ethics committee for more than a<br>decade now and is an observer on<br>academic promotion committees<br>her expertise on penguin ecology has led<br>to her invitation to membership of the<br>iucn specialist group penguin specialist<br>group the reintro reintroduction<br>specialist group and the hubara busted<br>advisory group<br>yolanda was also a member of the<br>department of conservation's yellow-eyed<br>penguin recovery group<br>professor van hezek's urban diverse<br>biodiversity work attracts media<br>interests both in new zealand and<br>worldwide in the print media and with<br>numerous appearances on radio and<br>television shows including the bbc<br>but now is the time to hear from yolanda<br>in her own words so please join me in<br>welcoming tonight's speaker professor<br>thank you for that introduction<br>tenecotto<br>otapoti tektura kawai<br>itupu<br>ki otapoti iraro o te maru o<br>tamauka kapuka tamahaka<br>i was born in dunedin<br>and in fact i was born exactly one<br>kilometer north of this lecture theatre<br>and um<br>although i've spent some parts of my<br>life away from dunedin<br>just trying to advance the uh<br>sorry<br>right<br>sorry although i've spent some parts of<br>my life away from dunedin i've always<br>come back to dunedin and i've always<br>come back to the university of otago so<br>as richard said i did my undergraduate<br>studies here at the university of otago<br>and when i started i didn't really know<br>what i wanted to to do i didn't have a<br>particular career in mind and i took a<br>variety of of different courses some<br>were focused on plants some on animals<br>and some on people but it<br>but it rapidly became clear to me that<br>animals were by far the most interesting<br>and so when i was reflecting on my<br>research over the<br>extent of my career<br>i was quite bemused when i noticed this<br>pattern<br>so over time this is the proportion of<br>my publications that are focused on<br>either animals or people<br>i seem to be studying animals less and<br>people more<br>and in fact the reason for this is that<br>um i i'm really interested in urban<br>ecology and applied conservation biology<br>so<br>first i want to<br>describe just briefly some of my more<br>animal focused research but then i'd<br>like to spend most of this presentation<br>talking about the research that i've<br>so when i when i graduated here with my<br>honours degree which um incidentally was<br>actually on fish physiology<br>um i had the opportunity to go to europe<br>and this was my into the netherlands in<br>fact and this was my introduction to<br>birds<br>and<br>i ended up at the the netherlands<br>institute for sea research which is on<br>texel which is the southernmost island<br>here in the string of islands which<br>encloses the wooden sea the onesie is a<br>big shallow sea and it's a really<br>important area for migratory birds and<br>also for breeding birds<br>and um<br>i have to admit that when i first went<br>to<br>this lab<br>i was<br>a bit naive about how fanatical some<br>people can be about birds i hadn't heard<br>about twitches<br>and um and in fact my supervisor was one<br>of these people and so a couple of days<br>after i arrived in the netherlands he<br>took me out to a huge mud flat gave me a<br>pair of binoculars and asked me to<br>identify all the birds and i couldn't<br>really identify any of them<br>so i think he thought i was completely<br>useless<br>but despite that sort of rocky start to<br>our relationship<br>i actually published my first<br>study here that was on these two species<br>sandalings and dunlins and that was<br>looking at the<br>influence of chemo reception on their<br>foraging behaviour and there were a few<br>other papers that followed that<br>and<br>my time there really<br>taught me that i was<br>really into research and so<br>after i spent a couple of years there i<br>was lured back to new zealand with<br>a<br>a wildlife scholarship so that was one<br>of the last two that were given out by<br>the wildlife service before it was<br>collapsed and then turned into the<br>department of conservation<br>and it was to study this fairly<br>magnificent bird the yellow eyed penguin<br>so when i started working on on<br>yellow-eyed penguins<br>we didn't really know that much about<br>them there had been quite a long study<br>that was done by a guy called lance<br>richdale in the 1930s and 40s<br>and then john darby from the museum had<br>started to monitor their populations on<br>the otago peninsula but it was my job to<br>to do research just finding out as much<br>as they could about their diet and the<br>growth along their mainland distribution<br>and um<br>my supervisors were john gillit on the<br>right and lloyd davis but as richard<br>barker mentioned<br>lloyd davis actually took over the<br>supervision i started off with<br>uh a supervisor in zoology who was<br>he was quite old school and um the only<br>thing i ever really remember him telling<br>me was that it was a waste of money<br>educating women at tertiary institutions<br>so so i was really glad when lloyd took<br>over my ass my supervisorship<br>and of course john derby<br>played a really important role mentoring<br>me<br>throughout my first year<br>and i'm really happy to say that a lot<br>of the information that i collected as<br>part of that<br>part of my phd it's still<br>useful today it's kind of used as a<br>reference point um so i have a phd<br>student who's an audience male<br>and she has also been looking at the<br>diet of yellow white penguins using a<br>lot more sophisticated techniques so she<br>doesn't have to make them vomit she<br>looks at the dna and the feces<br>and um<br>and so by comparing her<br>data with the stuff that i collected 35<br>years ago then we can see that there's<br>been a massive shift in the diet of<br>yellow white penguins it's much less<br>diverse than it was 35 years ago and the<br>main species that they eat has you know<br>completely shifted and this is probably<br>contributing to<br>but after my<br>my phd i went to the university of cape<br>town<br>and again the research was focused on<br>penguins so this is the african penguin<br>and um<br>in this case we were looking at um<br>reproductive strategies so you know how<br>these penguins<br>um<br>raise<br>uh i guess the optimum number of healthy<br>young in the face of fluctuating<br>environmental conditions<br>and that work involved um fairly lengthy<br>stays on some islands off the southwest<br>coast of south africa that are just<br>covered in birds they're fantastic<br>places and i know that there's some<br>yellow white penguin biologists in the<br>audience so they can understand how<br>thrilled i was if you can see that<br>picture of me that there's all these<br>nests just scattered around on the<br>surface they're so easy to find compared<br>to yellow-eyed penguin nests which<br>require hours of crawling through<br>prickly scrub so i was pretty thrilled<br>when i got to<br>to see how easy it was in<br>on south africa<br>but following that<br>i was with my husband at that point phil<br>and we went to saudi arabia so<br>completely different environment and in<br>fact it was phil that got the job we<br>both applied for the job but um i was<br>politely told that they didn't employ<br>women and in fact i actually had to<br>marry phil to stay with him to go there<br>but it worked out okay in the end so i<br>and<br>we were employed by the national<br>wildlife research centre<br>and this<br>they were actually carrying out these<br>two quite large captive breeding and<br>reintroduction programs and one of them<br>was for the arabian oryx which is a<br>species that went extinct in the wild in<br>the early 70s and the other was<br>for the hubara busted and that's a bird<br>that you can see on the slide there so<br>hubara bustards are<br>found<br>across central asia and north africa and<br>the arabian peninsula but they've been<br>pretty much extirpated off the arabian<br>peninsula because they're a very popular<br>quarry<br>for falcon falconry and falconry is a<br>really popular sport in the middle east<br>and so there was this one relic<br>population in the far north and it was<br>our job to find out as much information<br>as we could<br>about the ecology of this population so<br>that it would inform the um the<br>reintroduction program<br>and so we spent a lot of time this is<br>our study site it's<br>a fantastic area it looks a bit like<br>mars but it's more interesting i think<br>it's in a huge protected area called<br>hara which is just located in the far<br>north so it's just under the border with<br>iraq and jordan<br>and it's a basalt lava desert and this<br>is where well it's about 12 and a half<br>thousand kilometers which is about the<br>same size as fjordland and uh there was<br>a very small population of these hubara<br>bastards roaming around there and the um<br>the protected area was policed by<br>about there were four groups of rangers<br>that were living in different parts of<br>the reserve and the guy on the left is<br>the chief ranger<br>ali al-muri and he was<br>just an amazing tracker and navigator<br>and also a really charming man as well<br>and as well as<br>that we discovered when we were there<br>that at the time anyway there was just<br>very little interest in the natural<br>history of species in saudi arabia so<br>there were heaps of opportunities for us<br>to travel around and collect information<br>from a whole range of species and and a<br>whole range of biomes as well<br>and when i i was back at the centre then<br>i was also carrying out research looking<br>at the actual captive breedings so the<br>rearing protocols around rearing chicks<br>and just looking at ways to improve them<br>so that the chicks that were produced<br>were um were healthy ones and would have<br>the best chance of survival once they<br>were reintroduced into the wild<br>so at that point in time all of my<br>publications were on animals and there<br>were none on people at all<br>but after nearly 10 years in saudi<br>arabia we came back to dunedin<br>and<br>we<br>um<br>so these slides are actually changing on<br>their own i have no control over this so<br>i hope that i can keep up with them not<br>quite sure why they're doing that uh but<br>um<br>so we came back to the position that we<br>had at the university of otago um in the<br>wildlife management program<br>and um i found that the research i'd<br>been doing in saudi arabia just didn't<br>translate very well<br>to new zealand and so that's when i<br>reinvented myself as an urban ecologist<br>and at that time urban ecology was quite<br>a young sub-discipline of course of<br>ecology but<br>traditionally modified landscapes like<br>urban areas hadn't really been valued<br>very much so the all of the focus was on<br>more pristine landscapes<br>or the conservation estate<br>but over the 20 years or so that<br>attitude has changed now and for example<br>in 2017 was when we were successful in<br>getting our first mb endeavor grant and<br>that was um well it's called our program<br>was called people cities and nature and<br>it was completely focused on<br>biodiversity and restoration in urban<br>areas<br>and then last year we were successful<br>with another grant<br>so for ecologists urban areas really<br>interesting for a start<br>there's a lot of people in them and<br>back in 2018 that marked the point at<br>which more than 50 of the world's<br>population we're now living in urban<br>areas so that's those are the places<br>where all of the population growth is<br>happening as well and on this graph you<br>can see the difference these are the<br>proportions of um for different regions<br>of human populations that live in the<br>cities<br>between 1950 which are the purple bars<br>and<br>20 20 which are the green bars<br>but in really developed countries like<br>new zealand then<br>that proportion is somewhere around 86<br>so for most people<br>they're their first experience of nature<br>and many of their daily uh interactions<br>with nature are going to be happening in<br>an urban environment and for some people<br>it's that that's it they don't go out to<br>national parks or other places it's all<br>happening in urban areas<br>right<br>it changed again so um<br>so the<br>urban areas so the so there is<br>significant biodiversity that can be<br>found in um urban areas like it is a<br>significant contribution to the regional<br>biodiversity and biodiversity plays a<br>lot of roles<br>in ecosystem processes and it<br>contributes to the generation of<br>ecosystem services and these can be<br>categorized into these four groups here<br>so you've got<br>provisioning services which are things<br>like the production of food or<br>materials or medicinal resources you've<br>got regulating services which are things<br>to do with the regulation of water or<br>air quality you've got supporting<br>services which include things like<br>nutrient cycling and photosynthesis and<br>then you've got these cultural services<br>which are actually become very important<br>in urban areas because they of course a<br>lot of people live there and and that's<br>the um the services that are concerned<br>with um i guess spiritual and uh<br>aesthetic values that are associated<br>with nature um also recreation and<br>ecotourism but there's been quite a lot<br>of emphasis on this mental and physical<br>health<br>and<br>for example<br>um this is a graphical abstract from a<br>study that was just published last year<br>it was<br>an umbrella review so it was reviewing<br>40 systematic reviews that most of which<br>have been published since 2019 on the<br>link between exposure to greenness and<br>and various measures of health both<br>physical and psychological and they<br>found evidence for positive links with<br>all of the things that are that are<br>listed there and there's there's been<br>particular<br>interest in psychological health and so<br>another study that was just published<br>this month which was one of these<br>another one of these big reviews<br>actually identified that there was<br>there was a<br>convincing body of evidence that shows<br>that<br>people that live in greener areas are<br>less likely to suffer from<br>psychopathologies such as<br>in children it might be adhd or in<br>adults it might be depression<br>and but also the symptoms are less<br>so there's so there's quite a lot of<br>evidence that being in green areas is<br>good for you but most of these studies<br>in fact are done by public health<br>people they're not really done by<br>ecologists and they don't seem to<br>collaborate with ecologists very often<br>and so what we don't know is what what<br>sort of elements it is of the green that<br>is actually providing those well-being<br>benefits<br>but some ecologists there is some work<br>now that suggests that biodiversity does<br>play an important role so that<br>there are more well-being benefits often<br>associated with people that are in more<br>biodiverse environments than ones than<br>people who are in less biodiverse<br>environments<br>and so that that kind of information has<br>just<br>resulted in this sort of plethora of<br>nature-based therapies if you have a<br>look on the internet there's heaps of<br>books and different courses and all<br>so<br>so cities as i mentioned they can make<br>significant contributions to regional<br>biodiversity i mean of course they're<br>highly modified landscapes so natural<br>habitats have been um have been built<br>over and there's a whole lot of human<br>related infrastructure like roads<br>um but still<br>in some places say in in europe it's<br>been shown that some species actually<br>find refuges in cities they are<br>declining in say production landscapes<br>that surround the cities but they're<br>and urbanization acts as a massive<br>filter though for species so essentially<br>as um<br>if you look at this this is the<br>relationship between abundance of<br>species and human population density<br>that you get these three main groups so<br>one group are the urban avoiders these<br>are these ones here and those are the<br>species that are just completely<br>intolerant of of any or all of the of<br>the um the conditions that come with<br>human population density and then you've<br>got the urban adapters so they are okay<br>up to a certain point but when the human<br>population gets at a certain density<br>then they start to drop out<br>and then you've got a group of species<br>which are the urban exploiters and<br>they're the ones that are actually<br>benefiting from people you know they're<br>using structures that are built by<br>people or they're eating food which is<br>provided by people<br>but even those if once the human<br>population density gets to a certain<br>point they can also disappear too and a<br>good example of that is um is the house<br>sparrow which i'm sure you're all<br>familiar with<br>so in some cities in the uk and in<br>europe and in some parts of those cities<br>health sparrows have actually<br>disappeared and the general feeling is<br>that there's just not enough vegetation<br>volume in those parts of the cities to<br>support the invertebrates that house<br>so i'd like to<br>before i start talking my own research i<br>want to talk about these three different<br>paradigms um of urban ecology so as i<br>mentioned urban ecology is quite a young<br>discipline and um<br>but over over time it's kind of evolved<br>through these different ways of thinking<br>and so the first is referred to as<br>ecology in the city<br>and<br>and this is where um i guess ecologists<br>take their skill set and they apply them<br>to familiar habitats which<br>which are actually embedded in a in an<br>urban landscape so they it might be<br>fragments of bush or the town belt or<br>cemeteries or something like that<br>um but then<br>in ecology of the city the focus moves<br>away from those biotic features and it<br>adopts more of a holistic sociological<br>approach so it's recognizing that it's<br>some socially derived processes that are<br>actually driving a lot of the the um the<br>things that are happening with different<br>species and<br>in cities and towns<br>and this this paradigm actually requires<br>collaboration um with other scientists<br>like social scientists but you know<br>maybe with economists or with urban<br>and<br>um and this paradigm is has sort of<br>emerged more recently i guess and um<br>it's really come about<br>in response to uh i guess social goals<br>for urban sustainability and so it's<br>kind of a unifying paradigm because it<br>takes the information that you get from<br>the other two paradigms and then it<br>addresses issues around<br>human well-being and urban livability<br>and so this paradigm really requires<br>collaboration or engagement with the<br>decision makers so not just urban<br>residents but<br>but<br>policy makers and<br>i guess professional practitioners as<br>well<br>i think that my research has really um<br>reflected that journey<br>and sort of inadvertently so first of<br>all i would like to talk about some of<br>the stuff that i've done<br>which falls into that paradigm of<br>ecology in the city<br>and i started out by just<br>was interested in birds distributions of<br>birds and the the different<br>factors that drive their distributions<br>and so we did lots of bird counts right<br>across the whole city and we measured a<br>lot of the<br>of the different features of the<br>vegetation and modeled which of those<br>features were the most important and if<br>just going back to that figure i showed<br>you before<br>these<br>are examples of urban avoiders here in<br>dunedin so there's robins and tomtits<br>and they're<br>sitting just on the edge of the city but<br>they don't come in or if they do come in<br>perhaps they just get eaten really<br>quickly so you don't really see them in<br>the city and then<br>at the other extreme you've got the<br>urban exploiters like the house sparrows<br>and starlings<br>and then among the urban adapters<br>you've got um these native species so<br>tui<br>bell bird and kerou and<br>but the way you find these birds is<br>really dependent on um characteristics<br>of of the vegetation so we found when we<br>we modeled which ones were the most<br>important that it's vegetation volume um<br>it's the proportion of native species<br>and the vegetation and also features<br>like whether there are any tall trees<br>and so so the actual numbers can vary<br>hugely across the urban gradient so this<br>figure here just shows the<br>proportion of the total counted so the<br>dark green bars are those birds like tui<br>and bell bird which i've called forest<br>natives the the yellow bits are other<br>natives so they tend to be gulls and say<br>paradise ducks but you can see that from<br>the peri urban here where they make up<br>um the largest proportion of the count<br>and peri-urban areas would be places<br>like ross creek and that's where they're<br>most abundant they're also quite<br>abundant in the town belt but they're<br>more abundant in the parts of the town<br>belt that are dominated by native<br>vegetation<br>and then as you go through into<br>residential areas quite different<br>depending on where you are so that<br>residential three<br>properties that have<br>quite large gardens that are quite well<br>vegetated residential too<br>the gardens are quite big but they're<br>not so well vegetated and residential<br>three are quite small areas with uh with<br>poor vegetation<br>so essentially if you live in a street<br>like this then you've got<br>and you went outside you'd probably<br>about see well sorry probably about<br>somewhere between a quarter and a third<br>of all the birds that you'd see would be<br>those forest natives<br>and that's about as good as it gets in<br>new zealand actually it's quite sad but<br>it's quite poor compared to other<br>countries but um that's about as good as<br>it gets but if you lived out in the flat<br>in um southern eden<br>or saint kilda then less than 10 of the<br>birds that you see will actually be<br>those those native species and most of<br>them in fact will be silver eyes<br>gosh this um psycho is really hurrying<br>me along so i hope that i can keep up<br>so another study that i was involved in<br>with<br>within mclean was nest survival and so<br>we were interested in these three common<br>species black bird and fantails and<br>silver eyes and those<br>those percentages represent the<br>proportion of nests which produced at<br>least one young and that was over two<br>years that's why there are two figures<br>so we were able to determine the cause<br>of<br>nest loss for about half of those and<br>the biggest cause is predation<br>i think it was something like 29<br>um<br>and<br>i guess it was that observation that<br>started me um<br>thinking about urban predators<br>and<br>so i've done a number of studies<br>involved<br>that involve predators and the first one<br>was domestic cats<br>and um<br>the domestic cat study was kind of uh a<br>citizen science project i had about a<br>hundred um cat owners across the city<br>who were recording all the dead things<br>that their cat brought back over the<br>course of a year<br>and we also tracked the cats using gps<br>collars<br>and<br>the owners were always<br>invariably surprised at how far their<br>cats went<br>but always very interested to learn<br>um i had a phd student amy adams and she<br>was also tracking possums and the<br>information that she found was that<br>possums can actually exist quite<br>independently of bush fragments they can<br>be just living across gardens as long as<br>there's enough vegetation in the gardens<br>and this kind of information is really<br>important for informing<br>eradication strategies across dunedin<br>for possums and more recently charlotte<br>patterson was modelling re-invasion of<br>possums across the urban landscape<br>and andrew mcculloch was another<br>master's student and he looked at the<br>density of rats and was able to show<br>that<br>that in fact dunedin's not a very ratty<br>city not compared with say wellington<br>um that was confirmed more recently with<br>some work that we did as part of the<br>people cities and nature program uh with<br>with deb wilson from landcare research<br>um where we we<br>essentially looked at distributions of<br>the whole suite of<br>invasive mammals across the city<br>and other cities<br>but i think it was it was this<br>particular study that got me started<br>started that started to get me thinking<br>about gardens um it was on<br>the commodore grass skink and this is an<br>incredibly common skink it's it's<br>amazingly tolerant to habitat<br>modification and it should be everywhere<br>but it isn't um it just exists in these<br>small pockets across the urban area and<br>it's probably because it gets eaten by<br>cats and hedgehogs and and i guess rats<br>and mice as well<br>but when we again when we modeled the<br>different features of the of the gardens<br>where skinks could be found then it was<br>one of the main<br>features that was important was the<br>messiness of the garden<br>and of course the messiness of the<br>garden is determined by you know the<br>attitude and the values of the of the<br>householder so that really started me<br>thinking about how um how people were<br>obviously well well were playing a role<br>of clearly and determining what kind of<br>biodiversity we had and where it was<br>distributed<br>so<br>at this point yeah people were starting<br>to um to figure in some of my<br>publications<br>and i think that from from then most of<br>my research really sort of moved into<br>this paradigm of ecology of the city so<br>that's<br>more of a sociological approach to<br>thinking about processes<br>and<br>and of course this involved uh<br>collaboration so things started to get<br>more fun<br>and the first uh thing that i study i'd<br>like to talk about is it in garden study<br>and this was a collaboration with claire<br>freeman from geography<br>kath dickinson his plant ecologist and<br>barbara barrett who's an entomologist<br>for ag research<br>and at that time<br>no one had really done<br>any studies on garden biodiversity in<br>new zealand<br>and so we were interested in documenting<br>what kind of biodiversity garden support<br>but but we were also interested in the<br>householders and<br>their values and their relationships<br>with their gardens<br>and<br>so we collected a lot of information and<br>that we could use to actually<br>show what was driving that garden<br>biodiversity and in fact<br>there was some of the social variables<br>were<br>equally as important as the um as the<br>and so you know gardens are<br>potentially places that can support a<br>lot of biodiversity and<br>these two<br>these two images are<br>both from dunedin so the properties are<br>about the same size but you can see that<br>the ones up on the top left are much<br>more<br>biodiverse they just have a lot more<br>vegetation volume than the ones uh down<br>on the on the right<br>and um so i'm going to return to gardens<br>uh after a while but um another study<br>that i'd like to talk about which is<br>based on my cat work which is completely<br>different but it involved another kind<br>of collaboration that i found<br>really interesting<br>and<br>so and that was based on cats so at this<br>point in time i had done my cat studies<br>some of my students had done more cat<br>studies we had got lots of information<br>about what cats kill and we modeled<br>impacts on prey populations and we<br>tracked them so we had a pretty good<br>idea what domestic cats do<br>so i'd reached the point where i didn't<br>want to collect more information like<br>that i wanted to figure out how to<br>actually mitigate the impacts of<br>domestic cats on urban wildlife<br>and that that means changing cat owners<br>behaviour so again it comes back to<br>having to manage people<br>and<br>so<br>this particular study was actually a<br>collaboration with an environmental<br>psychologist<br>eddie mcdonald she was working at that<br>time as a social scientist in the<br>department of conservation and she was<br>um<br>her speciality was really um coming up<br>with<br>conservation messages that are effective<br>so conservation biologists are actually<br>really bad at conservation messaging<br>they don't get taught about that<br>generally when it's really it's like a<br>psychologist thing<br>and um so it was good to see how edie<br>kind of managed that process<br>so um the first thing that we had to<br>come up with and we did that through a<br>series of surveying cat owners across<br>new zealand and different vet clinics<br>was the behavior that we were going to<br>focus on and we chose this all cats to<br>be brought in at nighttime behaviour<br>which i actually disagree with because<br>it's not really relevant to new zealand<br>but my co-workers persuaded me that it<br>was a good first step<br>i had previously done some research as<br>part of a international collaboration<br>and we'd asked um cat owners and not cat<br>owners like that dark blue are cat<br>owners and these are the non-cat owners<br>and<br>a range of countries whether they agreed<br>with that statement so you can see that<br>in new zealand although the agreement<br>isn't as high as in the say australia um<br>or the us or japan<br>there still is a proportion of people<br>who agreed with that statement the cat<br>owners so we thought it was a good place<br>to start<br>and um so when edie is doing this work<br>she uh she applies this<br>theory from psychology called the theory<br>of planned behavior<br>and that's used as a framework that<br>drives the whole research process<br>and so the theory of planned behavior um<br>essentially asserts that there are these<br>three components that influence people's<br>intentions to perform a behavior so one<br>is they um their attitude towards that<br>behaviour<br>then there are the subjective norms and<br>those are really determined by the<br>beliefs that people have about important<br>other people as to whether they think<br>that they should do the behaviour hope<br>that makes sense<br>um and then perceived behavioral control<br>is uh really your um the way that you<br>think about whether you can actually<br>feasibly carry out a behavior<br>and so we embarked on this um i don't<br>want to show that yet oops<br>we we embarked on um a whole lot of<br>surveys of cat owners at all these cat<br>vet clinics across new zealand<br>and to collect information about each of<br>those components that would inform a<br>social marketing campaign<br>and<br>so in terms of on the bottom left in<br>terms of<br>strong normative influences then we<br>found that veterinarians and family<br>members would were those but not the<br>spca department of conservation forest<br>and bird or gareth morgan<br>in terms of the<br>perceived behavioural control we found<br>that it just wasn't an issue with cat<br>owners they were quite happy to have a<br>cat flap or a litter box<br>and then in terms of attitudes towards<br>that behaviour that were most likely to<br>result in this intention to do something<br>what was really disappointing for me was<br>that people just don't care about impact<br>on native wildlife so there was no point<br>designing<br>a campaign around that sort of message i<br>mean people cared about the safety of<br>their cats you know where they were<br>going to be<br>hit by cars<br>and they cared of course with their cat<br>liked being inside<br>so on the basis of that information<br>then we came up with these two messages<br>so each of them was we're using um one<br>one of those normative influences in<br>this case it's a vet and it's got a<br>message about cat safety<br>and in this case it was a little girl so<br>it was like a family member and she had<br>a message about um how it was nice to<br>bring your cat in at night and i<br>probably uh given<br>away what happens next but<br>one of those when we trialled those in<br>different vet clinics across the country<br>one of those messages turned out to be<br>much more effective than the other more<br>significantly effective so which one do<br>you think it was was it the vet and the<br>safety<br>you've already seen it it's a little<br>girl no<br>it was her and um i just wouldn't ever<br>pick that like as a biologist i would<br>never have thought that this was the<br>case so for me it really brought home um<br>just the value of these collaborations<br>that make you<br>think to do things in a different way<br>and make you i guess realize your<br>your own<br>lack of<br>skill in certain area and that's where<br>collaborations of course are fantastic<br>because you can pull in skills from<br>other people<br>so at this point yeah the trajectories<br>were starting to um to come together<br>so<br>for the for the rest i'd like to talk<br>about some studies that i've done that i<br>think fit into this paradigm so that was<br>ecology for the city so that so those<br>are studies that are really um<br>investigating relationships between<br>nature and human well-being and um and<br>and um i'd like to start off with<br>uh this study which was children's<br>access to nature<br>so back in um 2008 uh this guy richard<br>louv wrote a book called the last child<br>in the woods and he followed that up<br>with another one called the nature<br>principle<br>and in his first book he um defined he<br>coined a term of nature deficit disorder<br>and he said that urban children in the<br>us neigh were suffering from nature<br>deficit disorder they didn't have enough<br>contact with nature and as a result of<br>that they were suffering these kind of<br>physical and psychological problems like<br>obesity or adhd<br>and<br>his book was actually really influential<br>in that a lot of schools<br>started up programs where they would<br>bust their kids out to natural areas<br>so<br>um so claire freeman and i<br>were interested in how<br>children in new zealand cities connect<br>with nature<br>and when we we started the study it was<br>based on<br>children aged between about 9 and 11 and<br>we were interested in their independent<br>movement so their movements where they<br>weren't accompanied by an adult but they<br>we surveyed children over three cities<br>so auckland wellington and dunedin<br>and we asked<br>what was the availability of by by<br>neighborhood biodiversity for these<br>children and did they actually use those<br>areas that were biodiverse so we<br>actually had to come up with a whole<br>scheme for kind of measuring the<br>biodiversity value of all these small<br>so the children um had a interactive gis<br>map and they mapped where they went with<br>it from<br>their houses somewhere in here and then<br>we calculated their home range as that's<br>the yellow polygon we just used a<br>technique which<br>is commonly used when you're<br>calculating home ranges for animals<br>actually um<br>but but it was easy with children<br>because they could tell us where they<br>went usually with animals you have to<br>follow them around for ages getting<br>locations so it was great so that home<br>range was quite small but this one here<br>was a lot bigger<br>it included a park and some playing<br>fields<br>and then we had to define the<br>neighborhood<br>and on the basis of all of our we had<br>about 180 kids<br>the maximum distance on average that<br>they moved away from their home was<br>about just short of 500 meters so we<br>created a sort of a buffer that had a<br>radius of 500 meters<br>and we called that their neighborhood<br>but then the children also told us where<br>they weren't allowed to go so there were<br>some places where their parents might<br>have told them they couldn't go or maybe<br>there might have been a busy road so we<br>kind of chopped those bits out of the<br>neighborhood<br>and<br>and then we calculated their home range<br>which is the um of course the polygon<br>that you see there<br>um and so what we found was that in<br>those neighborhoods that there was a all<br>the children had access to um at least<br>one green space but when you looked at<br>those neighborhoods that had the bits<br>where they weren't allowed to cut out<br>then that number dropped to two-thirds<br>um and then when you actually saw looked<br>at their home range size<br>it was only 35<br>and um<br>the limitations that are placed on kids<br>are they're just usually parental<br>restraints um but also<br>kids we found that they were just really<br>busy you know they just had so many<br>after-school activities and things on<br>that they just didn't seem to have the<br>time just to go away and muck around and<br>roam around<br>um<br>and this their home range sizes were<br>actually i think on average only about<br>six hectares it's quite small um and<br>this reduction in home range size in<br>children has been measured in a number<br>of countries so it's not just unique to<br>new zealand but i was curious and i did<br>a rough calculation of my own home range<br>my independent one at when i was about<br>that age and it was more like 150<br>hectares and i don't think that i was<br>particularly unusual either so<br>children really are moving around much<br>less than they than they used to just<br>another generation ago<br>and the other thing that we found was<br>that children weren't using the most<br>biodiverse habitats you know often when<br>they went out they might just go to a<br>playing field<br>but despite that because we we ask them<br>questions about animals and<br>relationships to habitats that they did<br>have quite a good understanding<br>the reason why they did was really<br>because of the diversity that they had<br>in their own gardens and this is quite a<br>nice example of that so this property<br>there was a little girl living there so<br>she was not allowed to go out of her<br>property without an adult with her<br>but she still had quite a good<br>understanding of animals and<br>and their habitats and and so we think<br>that it's because she had quite a<br>biodiverse garden<br>and so we suspect that you know kids um<br>when they're not allowed to roam very<br>far or they're unwilling to they're<br>spending most of their time in their<br>gardens and so their gardens actually<br>assume a really important role for them<br>in terms of<br>so<br>i guess children are a group that have<br>um limited mobility and but that got us<br>interested in another group that has<br>limited mobility and that is um older<br>adults<br>and um<br>so there are a lot of evidence that<br>there are health benefits for<br>older adults both physical and<br>psychological<br>and so<br>claire and i embarked on another study<br>and this time it was with deborah waters<br>who's a gerontologist and we looked at<br>how aging affected older adults ability<br>to engage with nature<br>and we were interested in different um<br>domestic spaces so we surveyed a whole<br>bunch of older adults some of them were<br>living in there<br>in their family homes some of them are<br>downsized say to a like a<br>retirement village or something like<br>that some were living in council flats<br>and some were living in rest homes<br>and yeah we collected quite a lot of<br>information about how they felt about<br>their limitations but and when we<br>modeled<br>the factors that actually influenced how<br>much time they spent in natural places<br>then as you would expect as with<br>increasing age and frailty then that<br>reduces<br>housing type was significant because<br>people in rest homes really didn't get<br>out very much<br>and the nature connection score which is<br>a score that reflects your relationship<br>with nature was actually a positive<br>factor and that people that had a higher<br>nature connection score more likely to<br>overcome those barriers imposed by age<br>and frailty and to actually get out<br>but then<br>when we looked at the time spent in the<br>garden then none of these were<br>significant the only thing was their<br>nature connection score<br>and that told us that you know<br>regardless of how old they were and we<br>had people in our study that were in<br>their 90s um and regardless of how frail<br>that um that people were still able to<br>go out and spend time in their gardens<br>they became very important places for<br>them so um so they needed a nearby green<br>space and um and that was that was<br>essentially that role was filled by the<br>garden<br>so gardens are biodiverse sites<br>potentially<br>in places where people can connect with<br>nature but they also are nowadays very<br>so so in this image you can see an older<br>suburb on the left and a newer suburb<br>which is<br>characteristic of median density housing<br>on the right<br>and yeah there's a huge difference in<br>the amount of green area across those<br>two<br>and<br>as well as that<br>there are trends like uh increases in<br>hard landscaping so when we visited all<br>of the 55 gardens that we examined for<br>our garden study we went back to them<br>after five years<br>and we measured the differences in the<br>garden and we found<br>across the mall there was about a two<br>percent increase in hard landscaping so<br>or or things being built over<br>and<br>that might not seem very much two<br>percent but if you extrapolate that<br>across all the gardens into need and<br>that's something like 19 hectares of<br>land that had been paved over<br>so there are various<br>processes going on<br>not just increases in hard landscaping<br>but<br>looser regulations around infill<br>development and you know rezoning like<br>uh was in the newspaper today so a whole<br>lot of properties and um and dunedin now<br>can be sort of subdivided and<br>more open to medium density housing<br>and because of that you i guess in our<br>cities we have this proportion<br>of um properties that have big gardens<br>um they're traditional gardens but<br>they're diminishing all the time because<br>of those those different factors like<br>hard landscaping and yeah people just<br>extending their patios or whatever<br>but you also have an increasing<br>proportion of modern<br>residential developments where<br>the gardens are just tiny i mean i made<br>a submission to the council about their<br>rezoning<br>they made a provision in response to my<br>submission which means that in these new<br>developments<br>at least 20 of the property has to be<br>landscaped but 20 percent is hardly<br>anything<br>so it's really important that we um if<br>we want to keep having green cities and<br>stop the loss of biodiversity that we<br>have to really make the best of what<br>we've got but we also have to be better<br>at creating spaces and new developments<br>and an idea that we i had<br>just a couple of years ago was to<br>actually create a garden certification<br>scheme which is i've called garden star<br>and<br>this came about um at a conference in<br>2020 called urban futures in auckland<br>um i was the only person up there that<br>was talking about biodiversity<br>and i had an interesting conversation<br>with someone from kainga aura which of<br>course<br>is the<br>organization which is tasked with<br>building 40 000 state homes over the<br>next few years<br>and she was just really concerned that<br>there were absolutely no guidelines or<br>standards associated with how they would<br>treat the green spaces around their<br>houses<br>and so over a glass of wine we came up<br>with this idea of this garden star<br>certification because there's such a<br>thing as a home star<br>and that's a certification that reflects<br>your<br>sustainability of your house but we<br>thought we should have one that reflects<br>the native biodiversity value of your<br>garden<br>and um we hope that it would kind of<br>acknowledge<br>uh people who actually had good gardens<br>but incentivize other people to improve<br>their gardens<br>and maybe<br>set standards or track changes over time<br>and so i got together a whole bunch but<br>sorry before i go on um yeah it requires<br>a rating tool so essentially if you have<br>a certification program someone has to<br>go out to a garden spend one or two<br>hours there have a chat with the<br>householder and then come away<br>with information that can be condensed<br>into one number or a number of stars<br>that reflects the biodiversity of that<br>garden<br>and so that's what um i've been involved<br>with for a couple of years with this<br>huge group of people across<br>new zealand they're all experts they're<br>horticulturalists and plant ecologists<br>and um animal ecologists and uh we've<br>come up with this way of of doing this<br>which we think is a robust way of<br>measuring biodiversity<br>and so now i guess we're just in the<br>process of trying to promote the whole<br>scheme<br>so um i just wanted to talk briefly<br>about the fact that we haven't just<br>focused on private green spaces but also<br>on public green space<br>and<br>as part of the first people cities and<br>nature program<br>phd student audrey hazer<br>hayes work was really focused on<br>what kind of green spaces people use<br>what are the features about those green<br>spaces they like um what are their<br>landscape preferences and<br>to basically condense a whole lot of<br>stuff into one very short conclusion<br>people just really like biodiverse areas<br>as long as those areas contain the<br>features that they need to do what they<br>want to do which could be as simple as a<br>path or a seat or somewhere to socialize<br>then people will always<br>more nearly always regardless of their<br>ethnicity choose that left option over<br>the right and the left option is more<br>diverse it has more understory and it<br>so i feel that there's no excuse for<br>having spaces like this in cities i mean<br>this isn't a playing field it's just a<br>big area of grass that has to be moan<br>all the time<br>and oh and instead of streets that look<br>like this then you know why can't we<br>so right so i've reached a point where<br>nearly half of my publications are about<br>people but that doesn't mean that i<br>think that people are more interesting<br>than animals<br>because i guess while my research has<br>really been um looking at that<br>relationship between people and nature<br>and implications for well-being um it's<br>always motivated by a desire to see more<br>biodiversity in urban areas so you know<br>how can we take that evidence<br>um of the uh of the benefits that people<br>derive from nature connection and<br>leverage it into really good<br>conservation outcomes so that's where<br>so just to finish off with i just wanted<br>to mention the project that i'm involved<br>with now it's the um<br>the more recent people cities and nature<br>iteration it just really started this<br>year so there's a number of teams but my<br>particular team is focused on how to<br>actually inject more biodiversity into<br>these medium density built environments<br>and um of course that they're just<br>becoming more and more common in new<br>zealand<br>but we feel that they could be done much<br>better and so we've started off by<br>at the moment we're just reviewing best<br>practice both in new zealand but also<br>overseas<br>and then we want to engage with all<br>those decision makers again so the<br>developers<br>the the architects the landscape<br>architects the planners but also the<br>residents of people who actually live in<br>these areas<br>and<br>we want to be able to identify<br>design strategies and policy related<br>strategies that will improve practice<br>and result in a much more<br>right well my talk is hurrying me into<br>the acknowledgements so i just<br>this is my wildlife management class<br>from this year<br>on one of our field trips this is on the<br>tasman delta<br>i think<br>as any academic knows one of the the<br>great pleasures of the job is the fact<br>that you're constantly surrounded by all<br>these really<br>interesting and smart and enthusiastic<br>students and colleagues<br>and i have very much appreciated all of<br>my interactions with my students<br>and all my<br>my colleagues over the years and would<br>like to thank them for the contribution<br>they've made to you know making my job<br>so<br>so pleasant but<br>i'd also want to<br>acknowledge all of the members of the<br>public who participated in our research<br>our surveys can often be quite long but<br>they've been<br>really generous in their time<br>so this is my my parents<br>neither of them had the opportunity to<br>study at a university but they were<br>always<br>supportive of my studies<br>i think at times they must have wondered<br>how gallivanting around after penguins<br>could possibly ever turn into a proper<br>job but<br>if they did they kept it to themselves<br>and um they seemed to have a lot of<br>faith in the decisions that i was making<br>so i really appreciate that<br>and that's my mum and her garden<br>um she actually<br>worked in that garden until she was 93<br>it was 53 years it was a very big<br>productive garden and<br>and i think it meant a lot to her i<br>think she<br>she really she told me once that she<br>communed with god in her garden<br>but i probably should um acknowledge my<br>husband<br>so<br>phil said um our journey has truly been<br>a shared one so we we first of all<br>shared a study species the other eye<br>penguins then we shared an office<br>and then after that we<br>should we shared a postdoc in cape town<br>whoops this was the cape town<br>and uh and following that of course we<br>ended up working together in saudi<br>arabia and<br>and when we left that job then we came<br>back and we we had a shared position<br>here at the university of otago which<br>has expanded um out so that we<br>we're both working more than one<br>position now but i i don't know how i<br>could have done everything that i did<br>without phil so<br>thank you phil<br>and<br>these are my two wonderful sons connor<br>and jasper<br>and i wanted to thank them they've been<br>dragged along on so many field trips<br>over the years and they've been exposed<br>to an awful lot of shop talk over meals<br>but they have taken it all with great<br>grace and good humor so thank you you<br>too<br>and uh thank you all very much for<br>coming this evening kia ora<br>nicholson<br>professor barca professor blaikie<br>tennacotto<br>m greetings to you all especially of<br>course to you yolanda but also the<br>audience and of course yolanda's family<br>it's really wonderful to see you all<br>here<br>my name is mark lockman i'm the head of<br>department in zoology and it's really my<br>my honor and my pleasure to be able to<br>reflect<br>on<br>not only your presentation here today<br>but but actually<br>your walk<br>your professional walk and your time in<br>the department over the last 20 or so<br>years<br>i guess as colleagues<br>what connects us is is animals and i'll<br>come back to that a little bit more<br>shortly um i guess there is also a<br>little bit of a heritage connect that in<br>your case<br>is evident in your name and in my case<br>is evident from my accent<br>and i should probably have worn a<br>an orange shirt<br>but but i'll leave that for another<br>occasion<br>never mind the heritage<br>um<br>it's it's really much more relevant to<br>today to talk about but animals and of<br>course the ipl that we've just heard<br>about<br>um professor van hasek has taken us<br>through her life's journey<br>we've heard her early focus on the<br>ecology of birds<br>and as time went he has changed that<br>and as yourself uh you indicated<br>you innovated urban ecology as a field<br>that you are really increasingly<br>passionate about<br>and<br>have extensively published then<br>she has highlighted that biodiversity<br>contributes to important ecosystem<br>services not only in natural settings<br>we've heard in that story<br>about avian communities that we might<br>find in our backyards<br>and the notion that some species adapt<br>to modified habitats and some don't<br>with time the impacts of humans on the<br>environment and their interactions have<br>increasingly found a place in yolanda's<br>research<br>these focal points are of immediate<br>societal interest and it attests to<br>yolanda's commitment to<br>both human well-being and animal<br>wildlife<br>that she has been notably present in<br>a space that intersects both fields and<br>a presence that has helped to bridge the<br>gap between the general public<br>and our immediate environment<br>indeed yolanda's strong societal<br>interest is a thread in her research she<br>recently started a project with her<br>colleagues elsewhere on<br>campus<br>that seeks to establish the well-being<br>benefits<br>of virtual reality videos of nature<br>and as one of the<br>subjects in that in that study i<br>followed that space with notable<br>interest<br>while we may feel comfortable about the<br>link between well-being and nature<br>some contentious issues have also arisen<br>as part of yolanda's research and she's<br>hinted at some of that<br>we have heard the word cats come up<br>and the idea that cats might be doing<br>stuff that the owners rather didn't know<br>about<br>well in publicizing this and local media<br>outlets<br>some of the cat-loving folks have not<br>necessarily responded with<br>yes we're all in favor of what you're<br>saying um rather phyllis told me that<br>yolanda has<br>received plenty of message that was<br>written in caps only and with lots of<br>extra exclamation marks um and and i<br>think we could probably imagine what<br>these messages may have said<br>but you marched on<br>i feel compelled and you also hinted at<br>that in your ipl um and um professor<br>barker also mentioned that<br>especially about<br>women in science and being a mum and<br>obviously<br>that pertains to you not to me<br>but there is this issue about being a<br>mom and pursuing an academic career and<br>the conflict between time for these<br>priorities<br>is really a difficult one to manage<br>i really extend my full admiration to<br>yolanda for having managed to fill both<br>these tasks or these priorities so<br>excellently i<br>do think um<br>that it is probably still easier for men<br>than it is for women to have this<br>this dual role these dual priorities and<br>so<br>it's absolutely fantastic how you have<br>succeeded<br>i started my role as header department<br>at the start of this year and<br>one of the delights that comes with that<br>job believes some and i can see some<br>people grizzle and kind of go the lights<br>had a department surely not but no there<br>are some delights that come with that<br>job<br>and one of those is that one gets to<br>find out<br>much more about the workings of the<br>department<br>and especially about the workings of<br>one's colleagues<br>so i think it's fair enough to say that<br>with the different disciplines where you<br>did the big stuff the important stuff<br>and i look at little parts within an<br>animal<br>we don't have much overlap in the<br>research that we do<br>but being in that head of department<br>role has given me a real privilege and<br>insight about the fantastic<br>contributions that yolanda has made to<br>our department<br>it's already mentioned she has been<br>representing zoology on the animal<br>ethics committee<br>and this is a big a really big service<br>job<br>in that role<br>she hasn't just kind of gone to the<br>meetings<br>but certainly on number of occasions<br>i've expressed my frustrations you've<br>listened to me you've provided advice<br>and i'm sure i'm not the only one so<br>thank you<br>you've also taken on the role as<br>director of wildlife management last<br>year and of course the administration<br>and the people management that comes<br>with that role<br>recognition for the quality of your work<br>is evident not only from a long list of<br>research publications but also from the<br>in closing professor van hazek's<br>commitment to well-being are reflected<br>not only in her research and service<br>roles but also in her teaching and we've<br>again heard about that before and now is<br>a great time to reiterate that input and<br>to say thank you<br>thank you so much for your contribution<br>to shaping and teaching and developing<br>the next generation<br>of conservation biologists<br>i would like to finish with the<br>whakatoki<br>fire<br>knowledge for the sake of your<br>well-being<br>and this whakatauki seems something that<br>can be readily applied to the natural<br>world world<br>and the role that urban wildlife plays<br>in this<br>so cura yolanda for your wonderful um<br>coreyro and for your contributions to<br>the department for over 20 years<br>this is the moment where i duck duck<br>under the table<br>and um i would like to say on behalf of<br>the department but especially the<br>university at large thank you thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
