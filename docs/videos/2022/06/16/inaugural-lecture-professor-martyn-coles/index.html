So, whether you are making a new disease curing drug, or a light harvesting molecule for the production of clean energy, the same fundamental building blocks are used. What differentiates these materials is which component pieces are being used and how they are joined together.<br><br>In this inaugural lecture, Professor Martyn Coles from the School of Chemical and Physical Sciences discusses how his journey in synthetic chemistry has focused on understanding how these pieces fit and how we can control the processes that lead to new chemical compounds.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>welcome to everyone<br>to all our guests<br>academic colleagues students<br>supporters and friends to the inaugural<br>professorial lecture of martin coles<br>professor of chemistry in the school of<br>chemical and physical sciences<br>martin we've been looking forward to<br>tonight for some time<br>as people will know um martin's uh<br>professorial lecture was postponed last<br>year due to covert so it's lovely to be<br>here tonight<br>for any guests who might not know me i'm<br>jennifer windsor i'm acting vice<br>chancellor and it's a real pleasure to<br>welcome you here this evening i'm<br>pleased to be joined by colleagues from<br>the senior leadership team and by<br>colleagues from around the university<br>professor coles is a leading authority<br>on the chemistry of the heavy main group<br>elements in the periodic table<br>he specializes in the synthesis and<br>reactivity mainly of metallic element<br>compounds<br>martin joined the university in 2011<br>via durham<br>iowa berkeley and sussex<br>he was made professor here in 2019<br>i think martin is at the very top of his<br>game<br>he's a prolific scholar<br>researcher and grant awardee and as one<br>example of that he won the 2011 morris<br>wilkins enterprise for chemical science<br>he's equally well known i think for his<br>dedication to teaching<br>he's one seen as one of the most<br>approachable lecturers that students<br>could hope for<br>and he's passionate about sharing his<br>love for chemistry with students<br>i'd also note in his former role as head<br>of school he's also made a key<br>contribution and administrative<br>contribution in supporting the school<br>with all of its significant lab-based<br>activities through the early stages of<br>covet<br>so who we have with us tonight<br>is<br>what i'd call as a triple threat<br>type of scholar<br>whose contributions and achievements<br>really do span research teaching and<br>engagement<br>and among his achievements and his<br>contributions<br>it's his scholarship that is center<br>stage this evening<br>most recently professor cole's research<br>has focused on finding uses for chemical<br>compounds like the gas as carbon dioxide<br>and carbon monoxide in the formation of<br>useful products<br>he's also an important voice in the<br>technology and instrumentation that<br>moves synthetic chemistry forward in new<br>zealand perhaps especially related to<br>x-ray diffraction to determine the<br>accurate location of atoms in<br>three-dimensional space<br>but to me<br>martin's work on the most basic elements<br>and compounds of which all matter is<br>composed has a great deal of alchemy<br>beyond the highly productive and<br>programmatic nature of his research<br>i think his scholarship has both beauty<br>and power<br>beauty in the exquisite nature and the<br>precision of his calculations as well as<br>the simplicity of his physical visual<br>representations of chemical bonding<br>power in his predictive argumentation<br>and proofs and in the linking of basic<br>science and practical applications<br>i'm told that martin's passion for the<br>periodic table and synthetic chemistry<br>is contagious<br>that means we're in for a real treat<br>tonight as he talks about his work<br>related to that quite amazing atomic<br>number jigsaw or lego puzzle that is the<br>periodic table<br>and the new chemical compounds that can<br>it is my great delight to introduce<br>it's great to see you thank you so much<br>for being here um it's going to be<br>an interesting talk i hope for you all<br>i have deliberately postponed this a<br>couple of times due to my role as head<br>of school and i really wanted to get to<br>grips with this and engage with this<br>fully um and then of course it was<br>cancelled through covert but i'm so<br>pleased that we now have this live<br>opportunity for me to present my work so<br>it's great to see you all<br>um<br>interestingly i'm going to begin with an<br>apology<br>um i haven't actually checked<br>any copyright infringements<br>so when i refer to the<br>periodic table with reference to lego<br>perhaps i should be calling it the<br>periodic table is my molecular<br>children's construction toy consisting<br>of small interlocking plastic pieces um<br>i don't think that's quite as catchy so<br>i don't think there'd be as many people<br>in the audience if i had called it that<br>so um also<br>if there are any americans in the<br>audience i apologize i'm from the uk as<br>we'll find out<br>i refer to lego as singular i believe<br>america is referred to as legos plural<br>and of course we're now in new zealand<br>and so um i've gone with the the uk<br>pronunciation of lego okay<br>so what's all about then i am a<br>synthetic chemist i make things and the<br>way that i make things is i join<br>elements together<br>so you can see element a element b i<br>combine them together and form a bond<br>okay and what i want to do over the next<br>slide or so is show you how this can get<br>very complicated very quickly so here<br>we've got element a plus element b with<br>a single bond between the two elements<br>but<br>there are other bonds you can have<br>double bonds so i've got a double bond<br>between them here or even a triple bond<br>and of course if we've got element a and<br>element b<br>we can combine the a's together and the<br>b's together and then we can do that<br>with double bonds and triple bonds so<br>even just a simple case of two elements<br>and three different types of bonds you<br>can see the complexity is getting quite<br>quite um pronounced<br>then what happens if we have another<br>element<br>okay so now we've got three elements two<br>a's and a b or two b's in an a three a's<br>or three b's and then if we introduce<br>the double and triple bonds to that you<br>can see things are snowballing rapidly<br>so<br>how do we<br>bring this all together what happens if<br>we start talking about rings everything<br>i talked about so far was linear what<br>about if we start introducing other<br>elements okay and how do we get to the<br>point where we can look at these complex<br>molecules that we so much enjoy in our<br>chemistry<br>lego okay this is what i thought might<br>help us understand what i'm talking<br>about and what makes me excited about my<br>research<br>wasn't the first analogy i came up with<br>i tried another couple on for size the<br>periodic table is my artist's palette<br>where i paint<br>pretty molecules<br>but i've got terrible drawing skills<br>talked to my family i once drew a dog it<br>the periodic table is my chef's ladder<br>okay so i think i can i can get away<br>with uh cooking a decent meal<br>but then i thought<br>we tell our undergraduates no eating in<br>the lab so there may be a mixed message<br>coming across<br>but the common theme here is we're<br>combining basic ingredients whether it's<br>paints whether it's lego pieces whether<br>it's just basic ingredients and we're<br>going to make something more complex<br>okay and that's what i do and that's<br>what<br>i want to talk about today<br>so the periodic table okay so this is<br>the official definition according to the<br>oxford english dictionary of the<br>periodic table a table of the elements<br>arranged according to the periodic law<br>one in which they are arranged in order<br>of atomic number usually in rows such<br>that groups of elements possessing<br>analogous electronic structures and<br>hence exhibiting similar chemical<br>properties form vertical columns known<br>as groups in the table and this is<br>probably what we're very familiar with<br>this kind of picture here now there are<br>other ways of representing it but this<br>is the one that i've chosen to use in<br>this talk because i think it's one that<br>most of you will be familiar with and<br>the things we need to go no really is up<br>here on the left these are light<br>elements as we go down here they get<br>heavier and then it talks about groups<br>so as you go up and down here these<br>elements tend to have chemistry that's<br>quite closely related<br>so i'm going to take you on a journey<br>i'm going to take you on a journey going<br>back through my career as a scientist<br>starting to where it all began back in<br>the 1980s now i'm from the uk<br>i'm actually from a place near bristol<br>small village called winterbourne and i<br>went to elm park primary school when i<br>was um<br>eight nine ten eleven years old okay<br>just down the road from my parents house<br>um and it was there that i probably<br>first was introduced to the periodic<br>table and i first became familiar with<br>it um just knowing what it was maybe not<br>knowing too much about it<br>but i think this is where my love for<br>science really took off and i blame<br>thank<br>you choose<br>mr moore okay mr moore over here<br>he actually did practical chemistry or<br>practical science lessons in our primary<br>school and it was a comprehensive school<br>we didn't have access to great funds but<br>i've chosen three different experiments<br>that i remember specifically from my<br>time when i was about 10 or 11 years old<br>and we were doing a project on air<br>pressure and changes in air pressure and<br>what the effects of air pressure are so<br>these three experiments just very<br>quickly over on the left hand side this<br>is just a glass jar you can possibly see<br>in the bottom there are some matches if<br>you light a match and put it in there<br>the air rises okay so there's less air<br>inside more air on the outside pushing<br>down if you then take<br>a hard-boiled egg that's been shelled<br>plop it on top what should happen is the<br>air pressure<br>pushes it back down inside fantastic<br>great when you're an 11 year old kid<br>really exciting now this is probably not<br>familiar to some of the younger members<br>of the audience this is what we used to<br>get our oil in and it's a metal can but<br>exactly the same principle applies<br>presumably you have to clear it out<br>quite quickly before you put the matches<br>in<br>but basically the air rises less air<br>inside lower air pressure if you screw<br>the cap on run it under cold water it<br>collapses as the air pressure pushes in<br>and then finally we were actually made<br>some hot air balloons using tissue paper<br>and then put a little paraffin burner<br>underneath to heat the air and cause it<br>to rise<br>fantastic three things in common<br>they all evolve fire okay so for an 11<br>year old kid seeing things burn is<br>fantastic so i guess i had a career<br>choice to make at this was it the<br>science that i was interested in or was<br>i a future pyromaniac<br>you decide and i know you've all been<br>looking at this photo thinking where is<br>he which one is he well<br>if you ever want to find me in a photo<br>look how tall i am i'm always down the<br>front<br>there i am<br>okay so when i went to university in the<br>1990s this was my periodic table<br>okay there it looks familiar it looks<br>pretty much what i was talking about<br>earlier there were some unusual elements<br>down here though<br>u n q u n p u n h and u n s which stood<br>for unil quadrium unil pentium unil<br>hexium and unilseptium okay so these<br>were relatively new elements remember<br>this is the 1990s so some of them were<br>only 10 years old<br>um<br>i went back to my textbook and had a<br>look and see if i could see what they<br>said about these elements at the time so<br>this is my undergraduate textbook cotton<br>and wilkinson for those of you remember<br>that for fermium and beyond which are<br>these heavier elements fermions down<br>here so for elements 100 onwards only<br>sub microgram quantities down to 10<br>atoms or fewer were known for elements<br>106 and 107 there were no chemical<br>properties whatsoever known and greater<br>than 110 there was no evidence for them<br>in nature or in the laboratory now<br>they've been predicted people have<br>predicted these elements they've even<br>come up with a nomenclature for naming<br>them and i particularly like these<br>proposed names element 110<br>unilium and element 111 my personal<br>favorite<br>that didn't stick<br>this is what the periodic table looks<br>like now and you'll notice all of these<br>elements down here have been filled in<br>so elements 104 to 118 have now been<br>synthesized so these elements are made<br>in<br>synchrotrons by colliding other atoms<br>together okay so these are the dates in<br>which they were made and<br>i think that just serves to prove the<br>point that chemistry's still alive<br>chemistry is still growing if we're<br>still adding things to the periodic<br>table within my lifetime since i went to<br>the university then the subject's not<br>dead it's alive it's evolving where we<br>go from here i don't know we've kind of<br>run out at the end but um maybe in<br>another 20 30 years time we'll have some<br>more elements to add<br>so what i want to do is take you on a<br>journey as i said my journey through the<br>periodic table um i'm not going to talk<br>about all of the periodic table there<br>are some caveats to my journey the first<br>one being radioactive elements now i've<br>tried to avoid those because we all know<br>radioactivity is bad correct<br>of course it is look homer simpson's<br>glowing that looks pretty scary<br>so all of these elements that i've<br>outlined here<br>have no stable isotopes associated with<br>them so i've not done any significant<br>chemistry with them<br>now i've said that elements have no<br>stable isotopes okay so they're all<br>samples of those elements are<br>radioactive but there are other elements<br>out there that have radioactive<br>components okay potassium potassium is<br>an example so we have different isotopes<br>now isotopes differ in the number of<br>neutrons that are located in the nucleus<br>of those atoms so we've got three<br>different flavors if you like of<br>potassium k39 k40 and k41<br>okay and they vary in the number of<br>neutrons that they have now two of these<br>are stable and these are the most<br>prevalent ones so 93 of the time<br>potassium exists k-39 the remaining 6.7<br>is k-41 and both of those are stable but<br>there is a small fraction of potassium<br>that is radioactive 0.0117<br>or 117 parts per million then that's<br>unstable and that will decompose<br>thankfully it has a half-life of 1.25<br>billion years so we don't need to worry<br>but where do we find potassium<br>bananas<br>bananas are radioactive<br>but we don't need to worry about it<br>because the amount of radioactivity is<br>really small and when i was researching<br>this i found out there's actually an<br>unofficial<br>unit of radiation called the banana<br>equivalent dose<br>it's equivalent to 10 to the minus seven<br>sieverts which is the more recognized<br>unit and it corresponds to about one<br>percent of the daily exposure from<br>natural background radiation we're<br>exposed to cosmic rays we get<br>radioactivity from various other sources<br>so it's about one percent meaning 100<br>bananas you had 100 bananas it would be<br>your normal daily exposure to background<br>radiation<br>personally i think if you at 100 bananas<br>you've got some more trouble on the way<br>so we're not going to talk about<br>radioactives<br>what about the non-reactive elements<br>okay so over here on the right hand side<br>we have what we took we used to call<br>them the inert gases now we are aware of<br>them we've seen them we've seen neon<br>signs we've seen helium balloons but<br>these aren't actually chemistry we're<br>not forming bonds to these elements<br>we're not breaking bonds to these<br>elements these are just using the<br>elements in their elemental form<br>i'd like to point out this this picture<br>here actually and thank cara who i<br>think's at the back there um this was a<br>celebration for my 50th birthday when i<br>was head of school opening the office<br>door finding helium balloons everywhere<br>and the great news is we used our helium<br>recycling unit down in the basement of<br>laby which we used to recycle helium for<br>our nmr so we didn't even have to spend<br>money perhaps that's a money-making<br>scheme we could use later on<br>okay so<br>they're not inert gases we now refer to<br>them as noble gases and it's actually 60<br>years ago that this guy here neil<br>bartlett made the first compound that<br>involved one of these elements up until<br>that point people thought they were just<br>inert there was no chemistry associated<br>with them 60 years ago neil bartlett<br>proved that that wasn't the case another<br>example of<br>chemistry evolving of the periodic table<br>expanding if you like<br>okay so back to me back to my journey<br>where it all began durham so i did my<br>undergraduate degree and my phd at the<br>university of durham and i focused on<br>these three metallic elements vanadium<br>i used other elements as well i didn't<br>just use the metals and we'll talk about<br>that in terms of the sorts of chemistry<br>that i developed while i was there so<br>this is my snapshot of my time at durham<br>so i want to point a few things out<br>those of you who don't know where durham<br>is it's in the northeast of england<br>about as far away as i could get from my<br>parents without hitting scotland<br>the university is a collegiate<br>university so there's different colleges<br>i was a member when i was an<br>undergraduate and i guess i still am a<br>member of university college which was<br>based in the castle so in my third year<br>as an undergraduate i got to live in<br>durham castle this is the keep my<br>bedroom was around the other side<br>looking out that way<br>um<br>i played darts in fact this tie is my<br>college colors for playing diets<br>this is the pub we used to practice in<br>interestingly enough that pub doesn't<br>have a dart board you can guess what we<br>were practicing<br>um this is my first paper and this is my<br>first crystal structure um that's what i<br>looked like when i went to university<br>you can see my hair has got<br>big okay so<br>what did i research and this is where<br>the lego comes in and this is where i<br>hope to explain some of the sorts of<br>things that i've been involved in metal<br>complexes as reagents so they can be<br>used for forming bonds so we can bring<br>two lego pieces together click them<br>together form a bond between them or we<br>can use them<br>to come apart<br>now we don't do that with just atoms we<br>do this with molecules we do that with a<br>specif specific point within a molecule<br>an atom within a molecule so again we<br>can join them together so this is just<br>sort of a more realistic representation<br>of what we're doing and we form a bond<br>between them<br>okay and that in a nutshell is what i do<br>but you'll notice i have this<br>mlx and that's where my research has<br>been focused for the last<br>too many years 30 years or so<br>so what is mlx it's a metal complex okay<br>now a metal complex consists of a<br>central metal atom and to that metal<br>atom we put groups around it and we call<br>those groups ligands i'm just going to<br>denote them as l at the moment and it's<br>through<br>controlling these ligands we can dictate<br>how the chemical reactivity of those<br>metal atoms behave towards different<br>substrates and so by changing the<br>ligands by tuning the ligands we can<br>control the reactivity<br>it is a bit of a black box sometimes<br>sometimes all we're interested in is<br>taking the two things and seeing what<br>comes out the other side but what i want<br>to do as a scientist and what i've been<br>doing for the years is opening up that<br>box and having a look inside peering in<br>and seeing if we can understand what's<br>going on because if we can understand we<br>can change it we can make things better<br>we can control different things so back<br>to my phd i did my phd with professor<br>vernon gibson it was sponsored by bp<br>chemicals and we were involved in<br>ethylene polymerization catalysis<br>so there was a lot of research at the<br>time that it was involved in making<br>polyethylene or polythene using ethene<br>as a gas and the state of the art<br>involved this circadian zirconium<br>compound here so this is now basically<br>our metal is zirconium and these groups<br>around it are just our ligands okay now<br>two of those ligands these sort of funny<br>cyclic ones at the back here they're<br>just there to support the metal and the<br>other ones are where the chemistry goes<br>on so my research was involved in<br>looking at other metals and how we can<br>change other metals to see if we can<br>affect this reactivity so i focused in<br>on chromium<br>so chromium is now in group six so it's<br>in a different group in the periodic<br>table so it has different electronic<br>structure and so in order to try and<br>mimic the zirconium which we know works<br>we have to change our ligands and so in<br>this case rather than having these<br>cyclic ligands we have these<br>nitrogen-based ligands where this n atom<br>is nitrogen and you can see we've got a<br>double bond now so we've moved away from<br>single bonds to double bonds<br>thankfully it worked so if you activate<br>this compound and expose it to ethylene<br>gas you produce polyethylene okay so we<br>were quite happy with that result what<br>we're doing we're taking lots of<br>different lego sorry lots of the same<br>lego brick so these are our ethereum<br>molecules and we're stringing them<br>together we're forming lots of different<br>bonds and we're using this which is our<br>black box where the chemistry is going<br>on<br>now i just want to take a moment to<br>refer to some of the techniques that we<br>use in our research and as the active<br>vice chancellor mentioned<br>crystallography is one of my passions so<br>crystallography is a technique we use to<br>analyze solid-state materials or<br>solid-state compounds and think about a<br>grain of salt think about a grain of<br>sugar that's a crystal okay that's a<br>single crystal hopefully and what we do<br>is we take that and we put it in this<br>tiny little place here which is buried<br>in here and we shine x-rays at it and<br>the x-rays interact with those atoms and<br>they diffract<br>and then we measure the diffraction<br>pattern here and then we press lots of<br>buttons on computers and what we end up<br>with is from our chemical drawing what<br>we think we've got we end up with a<br>crystal structure<br>and this shows us where these atoms are<br>in three-dimensional space now why is<br>that useful well if you compare these<br>two drawings that's what i said that my<br>compound was but if you look at how the<br>atoms are arranged in the solid state<br>you'll see that there's two lines<br>between these carbon atoms so this is<br>carbon the white sphere is a hydrogen so<br>that's a ch2 this is a ph and we see<br>there's two bonds so by determining the<br>crystal structure we know that the<br>bonding is slightly different to how i<br>wrote it out in my chemical structure<br>we can also give better representations<br>of the atoms atoms are actually quite<br>large and so we can do what's known as a<br>space filling model and if we do a space<br>filling model we can see buried down in<br>here that's where our metal is so the<br>ligands are protecting that metal but is<br>there then enough space for the<br>substrates to get in because remember<br>the chemistry that we're interested in<br>is going on at that metal center the<br>ligands are around there to control the<br>chemistry<br>and finally it allows us to do really<br>pretty pictures for presentations and if<br>you had any idea how long it took me to<br>do this you'd appreciate it as much as i<br>did<br>okay<br>one thing i should say<br>when i came to vic we didn't have an<br>x-ray diffractometer but through the<br>generous support of the capex we were<br>able to um get one and it was installed<br>2017 i think it says up there yep 2017.<br>so it's been going for about five years<br>and it's been churning out results and<br>they've been included in many many<br>papers so i consider it to be a good<br>investment<br>and it's essential to not only my<br>research but to several other groups in<br>our school<br>it was fortunate that we were able to<br>tie in the dedication of this to the<br>60th anniversary of emeritus professor<br>neil curtis and we were dedicated that<br>room the x-ray diffraction facility i<br>should say to him to commemorate his 60<br>years<br>and so i just wanted to mention that<br>that was one of my most pleasurable<br>roles as head of school<br>the other thing i should mention about<br>the chemistry i do is it's air sensitive<br>okay what that means is air is a mixture<br>of gases one of the gases is oxygen<br>there's also water water vapors pressure<br>present in air as well and both of these<br>uh compounds chemicals elements are<br>highly reactive towards the kinds of<br>things that we make so we have to take<br>precautions we have to protect our<br>compounds from coming into contact with<br>the air and we do that for various read<br>through various means we do a lot of our<br>work in a glove box so this is sorry i<br>forgot what i was pressing and this is a<br>glove box so this is a box filled with<br>nitrogen gas now nitrogen gas doesn't<br>react with our compounds usually um and<br>so the gloves stick out you put your<br>gloves in and you do all your chemistry<br>inside this protective atmosphere you'll<br>notice here that these are our nmr tubes<br>these are all got sealed tops this has<br>got a sealed top here this is a vacuum<br>line so we have to protect everything<br>from air at all times we don't just stir<br>our chemicals over a beaker so it's<br>quite challenging to do this kind of<br>chemistry okay but i think it's<br>thoroughly rewarding when we get<br>something that works<br>now what i want to do is just show you<br>this should be a little video i hope it<br>works what happens when<br>we don't protect our compounds so what<br>we've got here is<br>this is a student uh inside this glass<br>vessel you can just about see here<br>there's a compound it's connected up to<br>the vacuum line so all the chemistry so<br>far has been done under an inert<br>atmosphere but he's about to take the<br>when it came in contact with the air it<br>caught fire immediately so that gives<br>you an indication of how sensitive some<br>of our chemistry is<br>now i want to watch this one more time<br>because i want you to see how efficient<br>look at that one hand putting the top<br>back on other hand reaches for the oven<br>mitt<br>and then he places that on top of the<br>fire very controlled very sensible way<br>of doing it snuffed it out immediately<br>and but i would also like to point out<br>he knew that was going to happen he was<br>prepared we have other people in place<br>it's all done very safe and that video<br>was actually slowed down about two and a<br>half times so he's doing this instantly<br>he's a very talented phd student<br>possibly even in the audience<br>um<br>so<br>i left durham i have my thesis<br>transition metal imido compound<br>synthesis and applications to<br>polymerization catalysis<br>occasionally i get out and show students<br>how not to write a thesis now<br>but other than that it sits on my shelf<br>with my other ones and there you go<br>still got long hair<br>off to get my bta degree now my bta<br>degree was it was a kind of a standing<br>joke we had if you wanted to get an<br>academic job in the uk you had to get a<br>bta degree been to america<br>so i went off to america<br>my first stop was in the midwest<br>iowa i heard someone mention it and i<br>spent two years in iowa working with<br>professor rich jordan at the university<br>of iowa where i worked on similar kinds<br>of chemistry so it was again looking at<br>olefin polymerization catalysis but now<br>we're moving away from<br>transition metals and looking at main<br>group compounds so this is aluminium so<br>again we're changing the metal if we<br>change the metal we need to change the<br>ligands to try and recreate the kind of<br>chemistry that we observed for the other<br>systems we looked at<br>two years great time then i went to<br>berkeley i spent another year and a bit<br>there working with professor t don<br>tilley and i changed strategy a little<br>bit there i looked again kind of similar<br>so you can see this is a molybdenum<br>compound these are some ligands around<br>it but we took these as precursors to<br>materials so we designed our molecules<br>we carefully synthesized our molecules<br>we protected them from air and then we<br>decomposed them deliberately to give us<br>a material but by looking at the<br>material that was formed it had<br>molybdenum in there it had other<br>elements and then we tested that<br>material for catalysis so much more<br>solid state um exposure there which is<br>which has proved really useful now um in<br>the current school that we're in<br>okay so<br>i can think i can cross a few more<br>elements off so we had vanadium chromium<br>molybdenum<br>i've crossed a few more off at this<br>point<br>then in 1999 i joined the university of<br>sussex my first independent position<br>okay now back in the uk here's london<br>here's brighton so the university of<br>sussex is um<br>on former campus just outside of<br>brighton<br>um it's a wonderful place out near the<br>downs um interestingly this is the<br>planned view of the campus now if i<br>stand here you might be able to just<br>make out<br>sort of a pair of ears<br>and a head<br>going down here to a tail<br>coming out there's a pool down there<br>it's actually a planned view that was<br>designed by sir basil spence<br>famous for the beehive and he planned<br>the campus to look like a cat<br>um<br>other things there were two nobel prize<br>winners in the department when i joined<br>so john corn forth and sir harry croto<br>the other thing brighton's famous for<br>brighton pier this is what brighton<br>pierre looked like when i arrived<br>unfortunately there was a storm<br>then unfortunately it caught fire<br>and this is what it looks like now<br>but it has a certain beauty to it now<br>it's just got the iron frame left and<br>what you find is at night the styling is<br>roost out there and so if you get the<br>timing right they have that wonderful<br>flying it's got a name<br>thank you it has that thing where they<br>all fly around and look really cool<br>there's me<br>got a haircut<br>didn't get a shave though did i<br>so i did lots of projects i'm not really<br>going to talk about them because i do<br>want to spend some time talking about<br>the research that i've been doing<br>recently lots of projects looking at<br>different ligands different metals<br>different reactions but the common theme<br>is we've got metals surrounded by<br>ligands so again we're just adopting<br>this technique<br>most of the chemistry i've done up to<br>that point involves the transition<br>metals these d-block elements in the<br>middle but there was a uh<br>i guess there was a sort of a move<br>towards looking at other metals so you<br>saw i'd look to aluminium so there was a<br>lot of research that was going on in<br>trying to replace these transition<br>metals with some of these main group<br>metals from other places in the periodic<br>table the reason being sometimes they're<br>cheaper sometimes they're more earth<br>abundant so a lot of<br>elements here so platinum<br>rhodium iridium very expensive very<br>difficult to get hold of and so if<br>you're going to do an industrial process<br>using these precious metals then it's<br>going to cost a lot of money and there's<br>also environmental impacts that people<br>have to consider as well so if you can<br>do similar chemistry with some of these<br>cheaper metals aluminium calcium<br>magnesium then perhaps that's a way<br>forward where this subject<br>can evolve<br>so i want to oops i want to talk about<br>heavy metal<br>yeah that was me<br>bismuth<br>so this is where i started my research<br>um in maine group chemistry looking at<br>heavy elements bismuth and there was a<br>couple of reasons the first one being it<br>was really under underdeveloped so this<br>pink areas at the top here are relative<br>numbers of crystal structures in the<br>database that i use regularly and you<br>can see that these are smaller compared<br>to the other colors so the smaller the<br>compared to the blue and the red and<br>that's just basically saying that there<br>was less research that had been done or<br>one way of measuring the amount of<br>research<br>now i chose bismuth even though it's a<br>heavy metal it's what we consider to be<br>non-toxic now that's very unusual for<br>this element because if you look at what<br>it's close to in the periodic table it's<br>near mercury thallium and lead and these<br>are known to be toxic elements but<br>bismuth itself is non-toxic put<br>non-toxic in inverted commas because<br>someone may pick up on this it actually<br>is toxic to certain bugs but for the<br>purposes of this talk we consider it to<br>be non-toxic certainly less toxic than<br>the other elements and so it has<br>potential use in chemistry so if there's<br>a little bit there then we can um<br>kind of ignore it if you like so this<br>was a target compound of them very<br>quickly bismuth three groups around it i<br>was trying to make this sort of linked<br>ligand um don't worry too much about the<br>charge so just look at the shape three<br>atoms around here this is to support the<br>compound this is to support the business<br>center this is where the chemistry is<br>going to go on and that was the design<br>that i had to look at<br>now around about this time i went on a<br>short flight<br>from london and i relocated over here in<br>new zealand so the chemistry i'm going<br>to talk about from here on in is pretty<br>much what we've been doing since we've<br>been at vic<br>so we looked at different ligands so<br>again this is now just more detail<br>around what we were talking about so<br>this is what the actual compound is<br>we've got these dip groups which is this<br>organic substituent here we've got our<br>three groups around bismuth but we have<br>to consider three-dimensional space<br>remember molecules have three dimensions<br>and so it's not a flat molecule you can<br>see it's like this pyramid it's like<br>this tripod<br>we also looked at this six-membered ring<br>so this is four atoms in a ring this is<br>now six atoms in a ring and so what<br>we've got here is an opening up and if<br>you look down<br>that<br>metal x bond or the bismuth x-bond so<br>this is now just looking down on top you<br>can see what happens to these groups<br>going from a four-membered ring to a<br>six-membered ring really pushes these<br>groups around that metal so by changing<br>the ligand we're changing the<br>environment at that metal center<br>so i want to quickly talk about main<br>group radicals the electronic<br>configuration of bismuth<br>looks a bit complicated don't need to<br>worry about those those are core<br>electrons those don't take part in the<br>chemistry these are field orbitals<br>they're again very stable what we're<br>interested in is those electrons which<br>we refer to as the valence electrons and<br>you'll see there are two in what's known<br>as an s orbital and three are which are<br>what's known as a p orbital if we remove<br>three of those electrons<br>electrons are negatively charged<br>the bismuth atom picks up a plus three<br>charge you move three minuses it's got<br>plus three left if we remove all of them<br>it's got plus five but what we found in<br>our research is if you react this<br>compound here so this is one we saw in<br>the previous slide with just magnesium<br>metal we could actually push it into an<br>unusual oxidation state and the unusual<br>oxidation state is plus two<br>so this is now<br>got a lone electron an unpaired electron<br>and this was the first time that this<br>has been observed on a heavy element<br>they tend to be very unstable very<br>reactive species when they're on heavy<br>elements if you've got a radical and<br>unpaired electron<br>this is what it looks like so again you<br>can see we've got the six-membered ring<br>but there's only two coordinate of this<br>there's nothing else and we proved that<br>by various other analytical techniques<br>but what's the big deal well now we've<br>changed the electronics of that metal<br>center it's got that one electron left<br>so can it do some interesting or unusual<br>reactivity the answer is yes<br>there's two examples i'll just talk<br>about one i'll brush through the other<br>one but this is white phosphorus okay so<br>white phosphorus consists of a<br>tetrahedron of four phosphorus atoms and<br>all of those phosphorus atoms are<br>equivalent<br>so we examine this using a different<br>technique called nmr spectroscopy and<br>this is an example of a series of nmr<br>spectroscopy from a mixture of p4 and<br>our bismuth radical all you need to know<br>is the number of peaks tell you the<br>number of phosphorus environments and<br>the shapes or the patterns of the peaks<br>give us a little bit of information<br>about how those atoms are bonded<br>together<br>so<br>just point out this line here as a<br>standard so we can all make sure that<br>it's all lined up and compared so we<br>ignore this peak at 20 degrees<br>centigrade we see just a single peak for<br>our p4 so all of those phosphorus atoms<br>are the same and that corresponds to no<br>reaction but as we cool it down we can<br>see these new peaks growing in<br>two different peaks tell us there's two<br>different phosphorus environments and if<br>we look closely we can see that these<br>are triplets and that tells us something<br>about the way in which they're bonded to<br>one another<br>forget the crystal structure this is<br>what we find has happened<br>so we've now got two bismuth atoms that<br>are bonded to our central p4 unit but<br>what's happened is we've broken one of<br>the bonds so you can see hopefully that<br>that blue phosphorus is the same as that<br>blue phosphorus because they're both<br>bonded to the bismuth and then those two<br>are equivalent as well they're related<br>by symmetry so we consider them to be<br>the same so we've got two different<br>groups of two phosphorous atoms which<br>explains our nmr so what we've done is<br>with our bismuth we've taken a bond that<br>exists between these two phosphorus<br>atoms and we've broken it so we've now<br>i'm going to skip through this one<br>because time's getting on<br>but<br>i want to talk a little bit about<br>aluminium chemistry so that was bismuth<br>i now want to talk about aluminium so<br>aluminium using the same kind of<br>argument is a lighter element so we're<br>now looking at a different type of<br>chemistry so we've got some core<br>electrons still don't need to worry<br>about those let's look at the valence<br>electrons total of three in two<br>different groups of orbitals we can<br>remove one or we can remove all three<br>now aluminium mostly removes all three<br>of those electrons to give a plus three<br>oxidation state and that's the most<br>stable and when aluminium is in a plus<br>three oxidation state it's hungry for<br>electrons it wants electrons back so we<br>say it's electron deficient and it's<br>there to take electrons from different<br>substrates and that's what dictates the<br>chemistry<br>but what we did was we developed an<br>aluminium one compound that has a<br>dianionic ligand that really pushes<br>electrons back onto that aluminium so<br>now we've got oh excuse me let's go back<br>so now we've got<br>that one there we've got this electron<br>configuration so we're checking just one<br>electron away so it's aluminium one but<br>we've got the same ligand<br>the same ligand that has two minus<br>charges so overall the aluminium has a<br>negative charge and that's an illumina<br>anion and that was the first time there<br>was a group in oxford working at the<br>same time as us and we were the first<br>groups to discover this type of compound<br>and what's so fascinating about this<br>compound is we've now got an electron<br>rich aluminium system it's got a lone<br>pair of electrons so we've taken an<br>element that normally behaves as<br>electron deficient<br>loaded a bunch of electrons on and now<br>we can look at the chemistry where we've<br>turned it on its head and it's an<br>electron rich compound<br>so this is what it looks like because<br>the aluminium is negative we need to<br>have a positive cation because overall<br>it's neutral and the cation we have is<br>potassium and you can see that we've got<br>two aluminium so two minuses so we have<br>two potassiums and they're sat between<br>these two compounds and in the solid<br>state it's held together<br>like this positives and negatives<br>attracting<br>so this is where we look at the<br>reactivity so we take this compound<br>which we turn the reactivity on its head<br>and see<br>how it reacts with different things<br>so this is carbon dioxide now i'm not<br>going to claim that i'm going to solve<br>the world's climate change problem but<br>what i want to do is look at how<br>fundamental chemistry can be<br>governed by these metal compounds again<br>peering into that black box having a<br>look see what goes on and what we found<br>was if we take our aluminium compound<br>react it with co2 we make a carbonate<br>now a carbonate here you can see we have<br>a carbon atom and three oxygens so it's<br>reactive with it kind of all come from<br>carbon dioxide because we've got two<br>oxygens here and three oxygens there so<br>something's going on but what we showed<br>by opening that black box having a look<br>in is it reacts with two molecules of<br>carbon dioxide the first one comes in<br>gives up one of its oxygens to generate<br>this species here that has an aluminium<br>oxygen double bond and we were able to<br>make that independently by a different<br>route we were also able to detect the<br>carbon monoxide that comes off<br>once we've got this compound it will<br>react with another equivalent of carbon<br>dioxide so overall we're taking two<br>equivalents of carbon dioxide producing<br>one equivalent of carbon monoxide and<br>making this carbonate<br>it actually tetramerizes and this is<br>going back to what the<br>acting vice chancellor said the beauty<br>of these molecules this is what i<br>consider a beautiful molecule okay so it<br>forms four of these groups that come<br>together and they are held together by<br>these positive and negative interactions<br>between the anions and the cations<br>so what we've done in terms of lego<br>taking two carbon dioxides we've broken<br>one of these carbon oxygen bonds and<br>formed another carbon oxygen bond so<br>we've got a system now where we've<br>broken and formed bonds in the same<br>reaction<br>cool<br>but i think it's cool<br>um the last reaction i want to talk<br>about is carbon monoxide so carbon<br>monoxide is the strongest bond in nature<br>okay so that's a real challenge that's a<br>red rag to a ball as far as i'm<br>concerned if we can do something with<br>these really strong bonds then the<br>world's our oyster and what we found was<br>if we take our alumina anion and react<br>it with carbon monoxide what we can do<br>is start to string them together so we<br>can start to form chains of molecules so<br>just reacting this with carbon monoxide<br>and this is at room temperature at<br>normal pressure just one atmosphere of<br>carbon monoxide you can see we've formed<br>a c4 chain so four carbon atoms have<br>come together<br>we can take that one step further we<br>change the conditions we actually change<br>this reagent a little bit and what we've<br>got now is five carbon atoms that have<br>formed or five carbon monoxides that<br>have formed a c5 chain okay now why is<br>that important there's an industrial<br>process called the harbor bosch process<br>which takes carbon monoxide and hydrogen<br>and it combines them together under<br>extremely high temperatures and<br>extremely high pressures and it forms<br>chains of carbon atoms and then these go<br>on and they're used in fuels and<br>cosmetics and other fine chemicals so if<br>we can start to understand and if we can<br>do this like i said room temperature<br>normal atmospheric pressure then we can<br>start to understand the chemistry and<br>perhaps we can do something with that<br>okay so<br>i'm not sure exactly what time we<br>started but i just want to talk a little<br>bit about academic research<br>i'm an academic i consider myself to be<br>extremely privileged to be in a position<br>where i can do blue skies research but i<br>think it is fundamentally important to<br>not only academia but to society because<br>without the fundamental research that<br>goes on<br>what are people in the future going to<br>look back at and i've got a couple of<br>examples so this is c60 this is<br>buckminster fullerene which was made by<br>harry croto at sussex one of the guys<br>that got the nobel prize and at the time<br>it was the third form of carbon so it<br>was just another avatar a fantastic<br>discovery don't get me wrong really<br>interesting discovery but no practical<br>use<br>nowadays derivatives of this are used in<br>solar cells for the conversion of<br>sunlight to electrical energy<br>so from 1990 to 2022 it's found<br>applications<br>similarly<br>arduingo made a stable crystalline<br>carbene compound carbines have a two<br>coordinate carbon atom and at the time<br>it was just a challenge no one had done<br>it before and now this is used as a<br>ligand in many many catalytic processes<br>so which are used on an industrial scale<br>so we've gone from having simple bricks<br>to making basic structures<br>but what i've been trying to do and what<br>i want my legacy to be is to take those<br>simple bricks and make more complicated<br>bricks because once you've got more<br>complicated bricks you can make more<br>complicated structures okay<br>that's actually a life-size bugatti made<br>out of lego and it moves<br>apparently according to tick-tock<br>um so i may not be in a position to do<br>this but i think i can concentrate on<br>doing this so someone can take these<br>parts and use them for the future<br>i've got a very quick thanks and then<br>i'll just want to summarize one last<br>thing phd students i apologize if i've<br>left anyone off this list it was a bit<br>of a hurry today they're the ones that<br>do all the work they're the ones that<br>really push this research forward and<br>again it's a privilege and a pleasure to<br>work with young minds and to train them<br>and to see them grow and develop as not<br>only as scientists but as people and as<br>individuals<br>collaborators technicians let's not<br>forget the technicians the people that<br>keep the instruments running without<br>those i would not be able to do any of<br>my research so absolute heartfelt thanks<br>bit of funding<br>here and there and of course my family<br>they've been behind me all the way and<br>they've supported me through this so<br>thanks to robin thanks for tristan<br>this i believe was taken at the top of<br>macro peak one of the good things about<br>lockdown was we could walk up the<br>mountain bike tracks without fear of<br>getting killed on the way down by<br>someone hurtling down vertical cliffs<br>so just very quickly last minute i<br>promise<br>periodic table and me i reckon<br>i've used all of these elements now in<br>my career<br>if we add a few more in so i've run<br>crystal structures for other people so<br>they've done the chemistry i've analyzed<br>them using crystallography there's a few<br>more we can cross off<br>you'll notice actually i've done some<br>crystallography on thorium and uranium<br>as well depleted what's left so these<br>are the elements that are left<br>i'm going to cross those off<br>the common thing about beryllium arsenic<br>osmium and thallium the toxic and nasty<br>which leaves just these<br>these are my remaining goals i've got a<br>few years left in me yet so watch this<br>space and hopefully one day i'll be able<br>to report some chemistry involving these<br>elements so thank you once again it's<br>been a pleasure talking to you and i<br>hope you've enjoyed my journey through<br>wonderful what's an amazing presentation<br>thank you<br>this reminded me of when i was doing<br>chemistry and then<br>a lot of things that i didn't understand<br>even at that time but that's that was<br>brilliant<br>um<br>my name is esson mesmaya i'm the pro<br>vice chancellor<br>of the wellington faculties of science<br>health engineering architecture and<br>design innovation<br>and it's my great pleasure to give the<br>vote of thanks to professor martin coles<br>for tonight's lecture<br>tonight we have had a glimpse of<br>professor court's passion for synthetic<br>chemistry<br>we have heard about this journey towards<br>understanding how the different pieces<br>of molecular puzzle fit together to<br>solve numerous problems<br>whether it be curing a disease or<br>fighting climate change<br>i'm impressed by the breadth and<br>application of his work and tonight's<br>lecture<br>is a perfect example of his imaginative<br>and impactful approach to science<br>there's still so much to be discovered<br>in chemistry and i know professor calls<br>values the ability to undertake<br>fundamental research that forms a strong<br>foundation of knowledge<br>for future generations<br>and for the future industries and<br>applications<br>i think it's very clear that professor<br>coles is an incredibly dedicated teacher<br>and supervisor<br>he's aware that the role of a teacher is<br>an immense privilege and honor<br>to both educate and enthuse future<br>scientists<br>and to give them the opportunity to be<br>part of groundbreaking research<br>and also to contribute to be part of a<br>team and work together at a global level<br>i'm sure that being a student of<br>professor coles has been an exciting and<br>inspiring experience for many of our<br>young people<br>as the vice chancellor noted professor<br>coles has received numerous accolades<br>from his peers and from all around the<br>world a recent one i know he's<br>particularly proud of<br>being awarded the 2021 nzic maurice<br>wilkins enterprise the premier prize of<br>the new zealand institute of chemistry<br>awarded to a candidate based on the<br>excellence and impact<br>of their chemistry<br>i think we can all agree that tonight<br>professor calls has shown<br>why he was awarded such a prestigious<br>prize<br>i would like to acknowledge professor<br>cole's wife associate professor robin<br>fulton<br>and his son tristan<br>who have joined us tonight and i'm sure<br>they are immensely proud<br>martin<br>it's a pleasure to congratulate you on a<br>fantastic inaugural professorial lecture<br>i would like to invite everyone tonight<br>to join us in the common room outside<br>for some refreshments<br>and first please join me in thanking<br>martin again for a fantastic lecture<br>tonight thank
