hunter<br>from the school of history philosophy<br>political science and international<br>relations<br>in a covered landscape this inaugural<br>has been a long while coming<br>and it is my great pleasure<br>to welcome you all here in person this<br>evening<br>including welcoming our chancellor john<br>allen joined by other council and senior<br>leadership team members<br>for any guests who may not know me i'm<br>jennifer windsor acting vice chancellor<br>of teherangawaka victoria university of<br>wellington<br>professor kate<br>hunter<br>an internationally recognized expert on<br>the histories of australia and new<br>zealand during the 19th and early 20th<br>centuries<br>she joined our university in 1995<br>received the university's research<br>excellence award in 2014<br>and was named a professor in 2020<br>she's previously been the history<br>program director and director of the<br>start research center for new zealand<br>studies<br>during which time she's refreshed the<br>census mandate as a penn university<br>center and a public point of connection<br>kate has also been a committed<br>university council member during times<br>of significant decision-making for the<br>for<br>in addition to her university-wide roles<br>she's an exemplary teacher<br>who lives by the philosophy of creating<br>emotionally engaged classrooms<br>she's known for inspiring her students<br>to pursue further studies and<br>postgraduate degrees and as a strong<br>advocate for the benefits of mentoring<br>especially in her own work through<br>mentoring of our other female academic<br>colleagues<br>now in all of kate's accomplishments<br>that we celebrate tonight<br>it is her work as a scholar that is the<br>lens through which we honor her<br>contributions<br>universities are called on to create and<br>share new knowledge new perspectives and<br>ways of understanding the world and<br>kate's scholarship her research her<br>teaching her engagement does just that<br>people often think of history mainly<br>through its ability to report on and to<br>record the past<br>but by definition history is also at its<br>heart about inquiry<br>about the particular questions we ask<br>and how we frame them and our methods of<br>critical examination<br>and about what in the part past has and<br>has not been reported and recorded<br>there's always been questions about<br>whose histories and whose voices we<br>privilege in trying to understand how we<br>have gotten to where we are now in our<br>contemporary human experience<br>and kate throughout her career is<br>renowned for her ability to bring to<br>light the essential significance of<br>everyday lives including everything from<br>work on first world war family histories<br>and cultural and personal artifacts<br>colonial fashion<br>film the press to wartime letters<br>history to me is also about narrative<br>and storytelling illuminating and<br>preserving past culture<br>that's also what kate does superbly well<br>she is a fabulous narrator<br>and this evening she will reflect on her<br>craft<br>it is my great pleasure to now introduce<br>hmm<br>i want to begin<br>this was the memorial library<br>of victoria college<br>libraries are some of my favorite places<br>they are treasure houses<br>full of the most miraculous and strange<br>things<br>i acknowledge this room<br>as the place where the academic<br>operations are discussed and planned<br>it is a rare<br>and precious form of decision making<br>in which all voices are heard<br>i acknowledge this as the council<br>chamber where over the last six years i<br>have been a staff voice in the decisions<br>there have been difficult decisions here<br>white knuckle decisions<br>but there have been thrilling moments<br>here too<br>and always a sense of shared<br>responsibility<br>an enormous breadth of vision of what<br>i want to acknowledge the people who<br>have stood here before me<br>especially the women<br>women make up barely a quarter of vuw's<br>professorial body<br>and i acknowledge those who have passed<br>on i want to acknowledge the women who<br>should have been here<br>ahorangi in mana<br>i also want to acknowledge my mother<br>first in her family to attend university<br>and first in the family she made<br>having left school at 15 she began her<br>ba at 40<br>and my teenage soundtrack was punctuated<br>by the olivetti<br>thank you john<br>neil<br>bernard vice chancellor<br>jennifer my current vice chancellor<br>and i think somewhere in the room<br>les<br>it's a bit harsh it's a bit harsh<br>perhaps we are magicians<br>we're illusionists<br>we create narratives of the past that<br>connect a to b<br>that link cause and consequence as<br>railway lines with stations<br>some historical actors get on and off<br>archduke ferdinand hopped on in june<br>1914 and was carried off rather<br>unceremoniously quickly afterwards<br>adolf hitler got on the train in 1914<br>but no one really noticed him there in<br>third class until stationed 1932 when he<br>managed to bluff his way up to first<br>that it was only literally a matter of<br>time before events occurred<br>often without meaning to we create the<br>illusion that if only we study the past<br>enough we will see where the hitlers and<br>stalins of the past got on the train<br>we can instruct our own station masters<br>to be vigilant<br>or to put it another way as journalists<br>and commentators often do<br>those who do not know their past are<br>but the past isn't railway lines<br>it's a pot of boiling water with<br>spaghetti<br>it's last year's christmas lights packed<br>away in a hurry<br>it's the bag of yarn from the jersey you<br>unraveled but haven't yet got round to<br>winding<br>historians are not unaware<br>of this sleight of hand part of our<br>profession<br>but we're also aware of how important<br>our job is<br>we're the weavers<br>we take many threads of different<br>colours we weave them together creating<br>the illusion of a total<br>a block of solid color a whole picture<br>but depending on the weaver and the<br>placement of the threads the picture can<br>look very dis very different<br>and this is why debate is such a central<br>part of our discipline<br>we argue not so much about what happened<br>although sometimes that can be a subject<br>for rigorous discussion<br>but about the why<br>and this is where another slightly shady<br>aspect of our characters comes into view<br>as i tell my students although i'm sure<br>they never believe me historians are<br>political animals<br>we're products of our own times<br>and our own research establishes<br>and constructs our social relationships<br>with the political structures of our own<br>lives<br>it's no accident that narratives<br>previously held as historical truths<br>have been challenged at times of<br>political upheaval and change in the<br>present<br>in all of these permutations and<br>challenges evidence the threads in the<br>tapestry<br>are crucial<br>and the struggles to have different<br>kinds of vestiges of the past accepted<br>as legitimate evidence of a knowable<br>history have been fought out<br>and i do mean thought<br>these were not always polite<br>disagreements<br>because they were struggles for<br>historical visibility<br>for meaning<br>for justice<br>and even where there were not open<br>debates the journey of particular<br>sources to the archives was never<br>inevitable and never smooth<br>in the 1930s australian official war<br>historian charles bean<br>urged the collection of soldiers diaries<br>and letters by the new war memorial<br>because they would add warmth to the<br>otherwise frigid narratives of the unit<br>diaries<br>however many of the archivists receiving<br>the letters from next of kin were put in<br>a delicate position<br>because such letters while clearly<br>valuable to families<br>were of no<br>the vast majority of those letters spoke<br>little about the fighting and so tended<br>such decisions about legitimate evidence<br>for history<br>have<br>as you can imagine had powerful<br>consequences<br>as illustrated in 1969 by british<br>historian jeffrey elton<br>who argued and i quote him<br>that historical study is not the study<br>of the past<br>but the study of present traces of the<br>past<br>if men have said<br>thought<br>done or suffered anything<br>of which nothing any longer exists<br>those things are as if they have never<br>been<br>others might have argued a softer line<br>but most historians agreed that a lack<br>of written evidence presented an<br>insurmountable barrier to creating<br>divergent historical narratives<br>the war memorial's collectors<br>demonstrated that individual decisions<br>about what constituted meaningful<br>evidence<br>shaped what filled archives<br>what became the present traces was<br>already determined by current thinking<br>a man's experience of bombardment was<br>significant but not his loneliness for<br>despite such arguments the cultural<br>fragmentation of the 1960s changed<br>radically ideas about historical<br>evidence<br>women's history oral history black and<br>indigenous histories<br>histories of everyday life<br>all brought new sources to bear on the<br>past<br>recollections and memories<br>spoken and sung accounts rather than<br>written ones became central to many<br>endeavors<br>the human consequences of the great<br>depression for example were illuminated<br>songs handed down in families and<br>churches framed histories of life<br>endured under slavery<br>private papers letters and photographs<br>enriched existing histories and revealed<br>new ones<br>but all the while debates raged<br>about objectivity<br>representativeness<br>and especially in the 1980s the extent<br>to which accepting multiple perspectives<br>this backstory and ferment within the<br>discipline of history only became clear<br>to me when i was an undergraduate<br>it's part of what universities are for<br>and the thing that makes us<br>subject of ridicule<br>not just to generate knowledge but to<br>and once you start questioning how we<br>know and what we choose<br>one is in disorient disorienting terrain<br>a place where your very self can be<br>challenged<br>yourself as a scholar<br>yourself as a white fellow in a black<br>fella country<br>yourself as a provincial young woman in<br>an elite institution built on 600 years<br>of male privilege<br>this is the labyrinth and the minotaur<br>if one job of the historian is weaving<br>making the past coherent and<br>intelligible for readers<br>the other is making the labyrinth of<br>intellectual discovery navigable for our<br>students<br>and through our journals and our<br>conferences still sometimes for each<br>other<br>illusionists we may be<br>weavers definitely<br>but we are also ariadne<br>we are the woman with thread<br>theseus may have slain the monster<br>but he would never got out of that maze<br>and no one would have ever known<br>if it hadn't been for the woman with the<br>yarn<br>so with ariadne's thread firmly attached<br>let me take you away into the tangle<br>that's been occupying me for the last<br>let me ask you to imagine a large canvas<br>tent on the periphery periphery of a<br>country show ground in the 1930s<br>in the main arena<br>men in beige dust coats and narrow<br>brimmed hats judge cattle and sheep with<br>an expert's eye<br>in the pavilion there are tables of<br>single blooms and vases plates of<br>vegetables date loaves and fruitcakes<br>jars of pickles<br>the crowd is thick with best hats gloves<br>and handbags<br>but in those separate tents where only<br>men go<br>there is a bar<br>and in another a boxing ring<br>and in another a stage<br>a beer a bet and a leg show all to be<br>then come away with me north into the<br>red centre<br>into the vast and warm openness of<br>orente country<br>to alice springs telegraph station where<br>frank gillan was appointed post and<br>telegraph master in 1892<br>the spring station a collection of white<br>washed door buildings next to a water<br>hole that was alas the product of a few<br>unusually wet years<br>was a link in the overland telegraph a<br>miraculous chain of imperial<br>communication from britain to java<br>underwater to darwin overland to<br>adelaide<br>post and telegraph masters<br>despite their astonishing isolation and<br>remoteness<br>were more connected with the wider world<br>and now a bookshelf<br>on which is a small blue and white china<br>dish<br>containing<br>a few ladies watches<br>bands of gold and black leather<br>tiny numbers on delicate faces slightly<br>yellowed to ivory with age<br>dainty winding knobs<br>one of them engraved on the back with<br>the name of its previous owner<br>they have all run down<br>the period of australian history that<br>i've spent much of my career researching<br>the later 19th and early 20th centuries<br>was one of two worlds one was<br>modernising<br>socially and politically progressive<br>politics journalism literature and art<br>wrestled with the meanings of being part<br>of an imperial family while forming a<br>national government producing<br>sentimental expressions of belonging to<br>an immense diverse continent<br>it was a society balancing and<br>incorporating being part of a globalized<br>network of travel trade and<br>communication while being at the very<br>edges of empire<br>my phd research into the lives of single<br>rural women captured many of these<br>themes as women fashioned their<br>identities as both dutiful daughters and<br>robust outdoor girls<br>aspiring to modern lifestyles even if<br>their circumstances did not allow them<br>there was another world<br>that all australian historians know<br>that of the desperate times endured by<br>indigenous people<br>by 1910 not only was land loss extensive<br>and in most cases irrevocable<br>but all australian states had in place<br>legislation<br>that not only defined aboriginality in<br>highly inconsistent and contradictory<br>ways<br>but controlled almost every aspect of<br>indigenous life<br>where they lived<br>their movements<br>employment<br>marriage<br>and most notoriously child rearing<br>by the end of the 1920s legislation in<br>almost all states declared all<br>aboriginal children under the age of 21<br>years to be wards of the state<br>these powerful structures of legislation<br>punishment and enforcement have<br>dominated recent decades of stories of<br>aboriginal life and for good reason<br>such repression cannot be left untold<br>but indigenous people have their own<br>stories in amongst the pain<br>and stories are told and retold for<br>their power in indigenous communities<br>iris lovett gardner and her sisters were<br>showies carnies in new zealand traveling<br>with sideshows they worked as ticket<br>sellers and on the fairy floss stand and<br>on the lineup boards attracting<br>customers into the show tent<br>iris also performed in the spike box act<br>in which the beautiful assistant was<br>shut inside the spike box and the handle<br>wound by an indian in a caftan and<br>turbine until the spikes pressed through<br>the front of the box and the blood<br>shows like this had a range of acts<br>iris described one of them as the<br>huchikuchi girls<br>there was the eastern snake girl the<br>hula<br>the dance of the seven vales<br>other shows had vanessa the undresser<br>they had fifi from tahiti and jiji from<br>french polynesia<br>they were exotic and erotic<br>except the performers weren't all that<br>exotic<br>iris and her sisters were gundachmara<br>aboriginal<br>as was the indian in his caftan<br>and everyone in the audience would have<br>known it<br>but like all audiences<br>they fell in with the performers<br>including in the fantasy<br>in the gloom of the tent with its<br>sawdust floor and makeshift stage the<br>universally known but universally<br>unacknowledged sexual history between<br>white men and aboriginal women was<br>shimmied and shimmered away into<br>something altogether more acceptable<br>girls when aboriginal women performing<br>as hula or haram girls appeared however<br>they were not simply the objects of<br>desire and fantasy<br>they had desires of their own<br>girls were paid a steady wage in an age<br>where most aboriginal workers had a<br>large proportions up to 90 in some cases<br>of their meager wages paid directly to<br>the state's aborigines boards<br>supposedly to be held in trust<br>these wages were either doled out<br>piecemeal by the authorities or more<br>sideshow performers however were out of<br>the reach of the various authorities and<br>were paid the same rates regardless of<br>race<br>iris also recalled it was an easy way to<br>see new country and move around a bit<br>as aboriginal people we were always<br>meeting up with other people that were<br>aboriginal too<br>living expenses were taken care of in<br>the show family but there is some<br>evidence that the women had to pay for<br>materials to make their own costumes<br>iris wrote that she and the girls with<br>whom she worked made their own costumes<br>bras and tights<br>and spangles the same color as the skirt<br>mine were always a pretty blue<br>she noted she had to buy the spangles<br>herself<br>presumably out of her wages<br>this was a world away from her cousins<br>so many of iris's contemporaries had<br>been removed from their parents were<br>apprenticed or in domestic service with<br>their wages held in trust<br>they wore their employers cast off<br>clothing<br>saving their small allowances to buy<br>essential and rudimentary clothing<br>that iris and her sisters were buying<br>spangles out of their wages can be seen<br>as a strong statement of autonomy<br>self-determination all that was modern<br>mobility glamour desire<br>proper wages<br>little glass beads sparkling in the<br>cracks of the nationwide system of<br>and those haram girls and their spangles<br>stayed with me<br>while i worked on iris's story<br>post-graduates take note it was a good<br>ten years before it saw in court saw<br>print<br>i was spending a lot of time with first<br>world war story soldiers and their<br>letters their diaries their photographs<br>and their souvenirs<br>and there's a lot more of them than<br>there are farming women or aboriginal<br>showgirls<br>egypt the desert<br>eastern women have a significant<br>presence in those papers<br>sequins velvet and lace are more common<br>in recent fossa king looking for ways<br>the desert was perceived in interwar<br>culture<br>i ended up<br>shelf browsing<br>the thing<br>where you go in for one thing but you<br>come out with six others that really<br>aren't related to what you were looking<br>for<br>a book on seven central australian<br>photographers who had made popular<br>images of the interior of australia and<br>its peoples<br>for eastern and coastal australians<br>these images were often the first they'd<br>seen<br>of<br>australian deserts although by the end<br>of world war one hundreds of thousands<br>early 20th century deserts were imbued<br>with meaning from a wide variety of<br>sources<br>they were biblical wastelands and places<br>of exile and temptation<br>californian deserts had been irrigated<br>into verdant fertile vineyards and<br>croplands and australian politicians<br>orientalists turned up artifacts and<br>maps and ruins that proved the bible<br>shifting it from a moral guidebook to an<br>historical document<br>archaeology had revived interest in<br>pharonic egypt<br>the classical world generally and the<br>birth of western civilization<br>discoveries of gold-filled tombs<br>bolstered images of aladdin's cave and<br>the thousand and one nights<br>deserts were places of nomads herders of<br>one of the earliest australian desert<br>photographers was francis frank gillan<br>turn of the century postmaster<br>amateur ethnographer<br>protector of aborigines under the<br>government's system<br>and scholarly partner to spencer baldwin<br>professor of biology at the university<br>of melbourne<br>they published two books together on<br>central australian aboriginal clans and<br>tribes and a swathe of scientific papers<br>gillen was the son of irish farmers<br>baldwin of manchester congregationalists<br>gillen was a night student at the south<br>australian school of mines and<br>industries<br>baldwin was educated at oxford<br>there is a great deal of research<br>on their scholarly partnership and on<br>their friendship<br>so much more than on iris love at<br>but gillen's work was not what stopped<br>me in my page browsing<br>it was in fact<br>pipe in mouth<br>waistcoat buttoned hands in pockets<br>frank is wearing a pair of soft leather<br>pumps elaborately embroidered with<br>chrysanthemums and at startling odds<br>with the stiff leather boots he wears in<br>every other photograph<br>this unexpected image of fashionable<br>domestic attire was a glimpse into the<br>world of men's engagement with what was<br>known in the late 19th and early 20th<br>centuries<br>as eastern glamour<br>usually associated with women's fashions<br>orientalist design and sartorial style<br>were also clearly enjoyed and purchased<br>by the 1890s men's clothing had been<br>revolutionized by the technologies of<br>the sewing machine imperial shipping<br>networks and warehousing that supported<br>the ready-made clothing industry<br>boot and shoe making 2 had become<br>increasingly segregated with women<br>forming the bulk of the machining<br>workforce and men dominating both<br>cutting and finishing<br>the slippers were probably made from<br>soft leather uppers machine embroidered<br>attached to raw buck leather soles for<br>indoor use and lined<br>where frank slippers had come from is<br>another question<br>his proximity to darwin<br>might signal that they came from the<br>significant number of shops in that town<br>catering to its large japanese<br>indonesian or chinese population<br>or they might have come from melbourne<br>sydney or brisbane all of which<br>sustained large shoe and boot making<br>the glimpse of frank's slippers lends<br>weight to the claims of fashion pages<br>and social columns of the late 19th<br>century australasian newspapers that<br>declared oriental embroidery was<br>everywhere and let's face it alice<br>springs telegraph station is about as<br>far from anywhere and everywhere as you<br>the use of the term oriental within<br>australasian newspapers was eclectic<br>however<br>reports of the ball at mrs tooth's<br>residence in darling point sydney<br>illustrated that the term really had<br>little fixed meaning<br>mrs truth received her guests in the<br>cairo room<br>the lofty pillared hall with its thick<br>persian carpets statuary and open<br>furniture was a feature of the house<br>guests wore<br>laces of oriental embroidery<br>oriental pendant of diamonds rubies and<br>grey pearls<br>and more oriental embroidery which was<br>carefully distinguished from indian<br>silver embroidery<br>the term oriental shifted and changed<br>sometimes blurring decorative influences<br>and sometimes referring to quite<br>specific things<br>it signaled that little about oriental<br>influences was connected to any kind of<br>ethnographic impulse<br>and as the harem girls of the leg show<br>tent remind us oriental could also be a<br>while eastern or oriental were vague and<br>untethered to specific places the term<br>didn't actually mean just anything<br>these terms signaled something to<br>readers and com and consumers about<br>color femininity decorative features and<br>associations with opulence and leisure<br>a globalized fantasy of color and<br>dormant was at work reflecting not only<br>what the east represented in readers and<br>writers minds<br>but also what australasian british and<br>american designs and fashion were not<br>the author of the four ladies column<br>knew her readers when she wrote in 1912<br>of new colors available for afternoon<br>wear if you were young and willing to<br>take a chance<br>some first class dressmakers<br>were willing to use a bright brownish<br>sulfur colour for street costumes<br>but she knew<br>that colour novelties are not apt to be<br>favorites for street costumes but they<br>are too conspicuous and most of us<br>prefer to keep to the grayish greens<br>clay blues and homespun greys and tans<br>now such minutiae of women's concerns<br>about fashion and color and silhouettes<br>has been very easy to dismiss by<br>historians<br>despite there being volumes of present<br>traces of the past somehow i can't see<br>jeffrey elton admitting that women's<br>walking suit fashions or frank gilland<br>slippers were of particular historical<br>import<br>i suggest however that in the interwar<br>period this minute description in<br>fashion columns revealed much more than<br>the latest outfits and fancies<br>in a long column in 1925 women's pages<br>journalist for the rural newspaper the<br>weekly times jacqueline gore<br>described the rehabilitation of fashion<br>after the end of the first world war and<br>the role that color played in the return<br>to flamboyance in design<br>the warship she argued removed colour<br>from people's lives<br>and it was only just returning these<br>many years after the armistice<br>attempts had been made immediately<br>following the war to rekindle an<br>exuberant spirit in fashion but it had<br>failed<br>and gore wrote<br>that success did not immediately attend<br>was due to many reasons<br>the experiences from which even we in<br>remote untouched australia were not<br>wholly exempt<br>had taught us many things<br>that shadow<br>which for so many blotted out the sun<br>itself<br>reflected upon those whose joy in

jacqueline<br>gore's meditation on war and colour<br>catch my eye<br>when most historians would not and<br>indeed have not noticed<br>part of the answer<br>is the blue and white china dish of<br>my grandmother was one of seven<br>daughters in a family in a farming<br>family with no sons<br>four married and three went nursing<br>they became career nurses<br>and retired to a set of four units with<br>my grandparents living in the fourth<br>they lived around the corner from me<br>and were a constant presence in my life<br>for the rest of theirs<br>one of my undergraduate essays was an<br>oral history of my grandmother's second<br>world war<br>two of my great aunts allowed me to<br>interview them about their lives for an<br>honours essay that became about the<br>impact of singlehood on women's<br>historical visibility<br>or invisibility as is the case<br>in all cases they prefaced their<br>agreement to be interviewed by insisting<br>that their lives were not at all<br>interesting<br>researching their lives alerted me to<br>the secret worlds of the unnoticed<br>from the impacts of the deeply<br>entrenched motivations of duty<br>so often written about by historians in<br>relation to young men in uniform but<br>never to young women with parents to<br>care for<br>and the opportunities of wartime and its<br>unexpectedly random effects<br>to the secret world of the nurses home<br>and the pros and cons of a bed under the<br>window<br>you had fresh air and a view<br>but you got climbed on by the nurses who<br>were home late and needed to be and had<br>doing this kind of research began to<br>train me to look for who wasn't there<br>who wasn't in the books we read who<br>wasn't in the newspaper or the archive<br>and it left me with a deep appreciation<br>of how important it is to give students<br>opportunities to work on their own<br>topics their own families whanau and<br>communities<br>and every day i see among my colleagues<br>those opportunities offered<br>and students supported to produce<br>research that gives them a stronger<br>in time with my grandmother and my great<br>aunts was never without handwork<br>knitting crocheting sewing<br>leather work<br>making boxes out of old christmas cards<br>by sewing them together with ribbons<br>now as one or two of you may know<br>i have a lifelong love of handwork<br>knitting has been my constant occupation<br>and quite possibly your constant<br>distraction<br>i have a tremendous respect for the<br>enormous skill and sheer mathematical<br>talent required<br>to knit a sock or a lace shawl<br>i have researched and written about the<br>massive economic value of thousands of<br>volunteer crafts women and their<br>underpinning of the welfare state<br>through everything from raw war<br>production a century ago to contemporary<br>knitters producing beanies for the<br>homeless and booties and bonnets for<br>every baby who leaves hospital<br>literally<br>the fabric of society<br>i have watched with interest as hipsters<br>and influencers introduce handwork to a<br>but i am also acutely aware of how<br>knitting is portrayed as all charm and<br>nostalgia sustainability and slow<br>fashion<br>until it reveals the underbelly of the<br>status quo<br>and the difficulty<br>of shifting and remediating persistent<br>inequalities<br>this lecture is not a finished garment<br>it's more like a group of tension<br>squares<br>just to give you a sense<br>of this historian's craft how and why i<br>do what i do<br>some of those tension squares are loose<br>they're full of holes they're barely a<br>fabric at all like the barest fragments<br>of iris love it gardner's story<br>but the gaps are as important as the<br>stitches<br>they represent the places where she<br>stepped out of history away from the<br>record-keeping machine of the state in<br>order to live her own life on her own<br>terms<br>frank gillan's<br>tension square and all its tweety<br>solidity<br>might nonetheless reveal<br>silky lining<br>stitching sewing weaving<br>wearing<br>they all tell us something about the<br>hidden parts of history<br>community<br>knowledge transmission creativity skill<br>welfare autonomy self-fashioning<br>resistance the importance of the senses<br>touch<br>feel color<br>they make material and intimate the big<br>engines of historical narratives such as<br>industrialization and capitalism and<br>colonialism<br>they can lead us to question and defy<br>these big engines too<br>a scholars such as kaitaku historian<br>michael stevens did in investigating the<br>role his pakeha big nana played in<br>maintaining the tt harvesting traditions<br>in his whanau<br>through her weaving and poha<br>construction<br>as he concludes it does not matter<br>whether the hands that operate purnamu<br>chisels or construct poha are maori<br>pakiha or something born of the two<br>the key point is that the hands are<br>skilled<br>but the evidence isn't easy to find it<br>takes time to accumulate there are lots<br>of dead ends and backtracking<br>how archives are shaped and organized<br>catalogued all mitigates mitigates<br>against certain types of histories<br>assuming the evidence can be found in<br>those places in the first place<br>it's equally important sometimes to just<br>pull out your knitting and see who comes<br>to talk<br>the key point is that the hands are<br>skilled<br>and far from being only frivolous and<br>fun color and craft might give us clues<br>to some contemporary challenges<br>we are living through a

after the<br>first world war and we might do well to<br>take a lesson from the pages not of<br>hansard or the war office document but<br>from the women's pages<br>where emotional recovery was intertwined<br>with economic and social recovery and<br>played out over a decade after the<br>i will leave you with the insight of<br>that great observer of life billy<br>connolly<br>to never trust a man who when left alone<br>in a room with a tea cozy doesn't try it<br>on<br>and i would add<br>and never trust a historian who doesn't<br>ask who made it<br>good evening everybody and<br>lava since it's samoan language week<br>i'm simon mckenzie i'm a professor of<br>criminology in the faculty of humanities<br>and social sciences where kate works<br>and i'm the acting dean at the moment so<br>i get the great pleasure and the<br>privilege of proposing on behalf of us<br>all a vote of thanks to kate for her<br>inaugural lecture as a professor of<br>history at tahrir and iwaka<br>i feel like i should probably also start<br>god i hope i'm not alone here first of<br>many i hope tonight by putting my hand<br>up and saying i have tried a tea cozy on<br>my head<br>on more than one occasion if you come<br>from scotland and basically it's<br>freezing cold the whole time and<br>anything that's warm is a premium<br>if you see a hot pot of tea with a hat<br>on top of it that's two for the price of<br>one right there that's uh<br>something you want to get stuck into<br>um<br>kate hunter is an internationally<br>renowned expert in history as we've<br>heard tonight our particular field of<br>expertise is the social and cultural<br>history<br>of australia new zealand in the the late<br>19th early 20th century<br>um<br>isn't it wonderful to hear<br>a professor<br>at the top of her game<br>talking about the subject of her<br>expertise um<br>won't you agree with me that sometimes<br>history can be almost artistic when it's<br>told<br>eloquently in the way that we've heard<br>tonight stories um<br>coming together to create pictures that<br>give you a deep emotional connection to<br>the subject matter in a way that often<br>um<br>we don't get from<br>historical stories i'm a real fan of<br>kate's work i was very pleased that i<br>landed in the dean's chair just exactly<br>the point that i get to give this<br>particular vote of thanks because i've<br>been using some of it i was telling her<br>early on for for some of my own work and<br>so there are two things in particular<br>that i want to thank kate for tonight um<br>two things i find especially captivating<br>about her work the first one is the<br>bringing to light of the hidden voices<br>submerged in the historical record<br>the forgotten parts of everyday lives<br>that have been overlooked or sometimes<br>the deliberately ignored people<br>who may have been deemed insignificant<br>by the various standpoints vested in<br>discourses of power that have written<br>our histories these are the people she<br>refers to in her 2011 paper<br>as the inarticulate actors in the<br>colonial past<br>so<br>no longer inarticulate then when told<br>through the eyes of a particularly<br>articulate reporter<br>it's hard enough to bring excluded<br>people into the frame<br>when they're here and alive how much<br>harder must it be<br>to uh try to find people<br>in the archives to find the traces of<br>these inarticulate actors and to<br>recreate them in a way that gives them<br>contemporary recognition<br>so that's the first thing i want to<br>thank kate for for bringing back in this<br>way<br>those who would otherwise be long lost<br>the second thing<br>is our focus on<br>objects<br>we've heard quite a few things about<br>objects tonight spangles and slippers<br>and uh a lot of knitting i knew there'd<br>be a lot of knitting i think we all did<br>uh<br>so academics especially uh sort of<br>sociologically leaning ones like me have<br>for a long time<br>made the mistake of tending to assume<br>that the world is mostly made up of<br>people<br>and<br>i mean of course that ignores the<br>material world around us<br>and<br>these are the objects that<br>give some important context for our<br>social lives<br>um<br>in recognition of this you've got major<br>figures like bruno latour talking about<br>reassembling the social in other words<br>taking the idea of the social and<br>bringing objects in as well as people so<br>that we can understand the effects that<br>these things have on each other<br>there's a good and well-respected line<br>now in object biographies which is uh<br>telling the social lives of objects as<br>they move through<br>um time and and and through context<br>in fact i've got some of kate words here<br>that kate's words that i'm going to use<br>um<br>the life histories of objects as they<br>move through and between cultures and<br>the way that their meaning changes with<br>context the social lives of objects in<br>other words um that's from one of our uh<br>papers on bird feathers<br>and again some of us are doing object<br>biographies but we we we have now i<br>realized the luxury of following these<br>things in real time as because they're<br>here and they're moving around the world<br>again how much more challenging it must<br>be to do this kind of<br>thingology as a bit of a sort of<br>ungainly word that isn't it theology of<br>things um to do that in relation to to<br>things that are just a line in an<br>archive or a side note in a book<br>somewhere which is mostly concerned with<br>something else usually people<br>so thank you kate for your study of<br>things<br>and putting these two together we've got<br>a very rich historical method a tapestry<br>of stories about people and things that<br>are not normally noticed a voice to the<br>voiceless a spotlight for forgotten<br>actors<br>and a celebration of things that have<br>been left behind<br>um<br>i mentioned this lecture to a friend who<br>told them that i was coming here told<br>them more or less what it was about i<br>think i probably didn't do it very well<br>because uh<br>they sort of stood for a minute and said<br>all right so um it's history but not the<br>no yeah<br>no no it's not it's not that at all but<br>but you know in the process of saying<br>that what are the important bits that's<br>we're socially conditioned to think<br>certain things are important aren't we<br>and the um and the various sort of<br>structures of power that sit around that<br>determine what we look for and kate's<br>work is a magnificent and a modest and a<br>meticulous challenge to that bringing us<br>not only to see the past in a different<br>way<br>but also in doing that potentially to<br>reframe our understanding of the present<br>of what we think is important and why<br>so i'm really glad that we've all had<br>the chance to hear more about it this<br>evening kate on behalf of your faculty<br>fhss yay<br>um<br>we are so proud to have you as a member<br>of our professoriate proud and grateful<br>um on behalf of all of your friends and<br>your colleagues and your family here<br>tonight<br>thank you for giving us an insight into<br>how you do this particular type of<br>scholarly knitting<br>um if you ever want to use the<br>provocative title history but not the<br>important bits i can tell you<br>who was the one who came up with that<br>um<br>a wonderful lecture now i'm pleased to<br>say that i don't think we've got any tea<br>or tea cozies but we do have quite a lot<br>of wine and beer and uh soft drinks<br>outside so i'd like to invite everybody<br>to come and party with us and um<br>before that naming we calculate kate<br>let's give a big round of applause to<br>professor<br>you</p></main><footer
