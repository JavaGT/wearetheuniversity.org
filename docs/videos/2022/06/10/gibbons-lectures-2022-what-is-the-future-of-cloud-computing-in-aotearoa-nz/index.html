we have another panel session<br>and on the future of cloud computing in<br>aotearoa new zealand<br>the facilitator tonight is danielle<br>lotterich um daniel's<br>best known<br>to some of you as an expert in human<br>computer interaction<br>her role tonight<br>is as the school industry relationship<br>coordinator<br>before starting at the university of<br>auckland<br>daniel completed a phd at the university<br>of toronto went on to a postdoc at<br>stanford university and then spent a<br>couple of years working at yahoo so<br>she's ideally suited to facility<br>facilitate this panel<br>and so i am thrilled to<br>present our panelists to you tonight and<br>so i'll introduce each of them in turn<br>and then we'll get right to discussing<br>what is the future of cloud computing<br>and so i'll start off with gareth cronin<br>he is the general manager for developer<br>platform at xero new zealand's most<br>successful software company<br>and so coming from california i met many<br>tech evangelists there which may be a<br>term that's a little less<br>uh common in in new zealand and so uh<br>gareth is<br>evangelizing technology critical to the<br>transformation of new zealand<br>new zealand's economy and<br>also talking about the need for tech and<br>supporting young people in their careers<br>prior to coming to zero<br>uh gareth founded ambit a conversational<br>ai chat bot and we we may talk a little<br>bit about that<br>uh tonight as well<br>and uh had some experience consulting<br>for air new zealand vista entertainment<br>led engineering for crime analytics<br>software<br>orion health and kiwi plan so lots of<br>experience on this panel tonight<br>and he's one of our own uh computer<br>science honors bachelor so<br>thanks for for coming back and<br>supporting the school<br>um<br>and<br>gareth has many interests like mixing<br>drinks reading fiction playing music and<br>still likes to code on the weekend<br>that's right awesome thanks for being<br>here<br>and our our next panelist teresa<br>corbilis is the head of google cloud<br>financial services in new zealand<br>also a tech industry veteran<br>she started her career at a telecoms as<br>telecoms industry analyst and led sales<br>and marketing at silicon valley<br>companies globally including<br>hewlett-packard ericsson and cisco<br>theresa's passion is supporting women<br>and girls to live up to their true<br>potential<br>and she does this work within google and<br>within<br>her communities to bring forth the<br>voices of those in underrepresented<br>communities to tell their own stories<br>and empower them<br>theresa is also a mum to a 13 year old<br>and<br>has a hubby who's also part of the<br>school in<br>psychology so thank you for being here<br>thank you<br>yeah<br>and next we have<br>tony buswell the chief technology<br>officer of ibm new zealand<br>tony spent a few years uh with the new<br>zealand army before spending 25 years in<br>the ict across public and private<br>sectors<br>including inland revenue new zealand<br>transport agency the ministry of<br>education and spark<br>tony started as a technical engineer and<br>has worked across operations delivery<br>architecture and sales<br>at ibm tony focuses on client outcomes<br>and<br>these are his words value orchestration<br>through the application of technology so<br>it sounds sounds sounds pretty fancy but<br>tony's very technical so any of the<br>technical questions you can just shoot<br>them right at him<br>thanks for being here to me<br>and<br>finally matt boswick<br>who<br>has whakapapa to ngati mahuta and ngati<br>pukeko is partner director for microsoft<br>new zealand<br>matt has previously worked in sectors uh<br>is such as public affairs local<br>government software startups and telecom<br>snooping his linkedin<br>i found out that he's been<br>busy opening a new matariki inspired<br>microsoft space with ngati fatwa arakai<br>commenting on the opportunities coming<br>up after jacinda ardern recently visited<br>the microsoft seattle offices so very<br>so<br>as you can understand why i'm so<br>thrilled to to present this panel to you<br>this evening<br>uh guests to discuss the future of cloud<br>computing in aotearoa and new zealand<br>and so<br>i'll start us off with a question<br>gareth<br>could you please start us off with<br>explaining a little more about what is<br>cloud computing how is relevant to xero<br>and what are the opportunities and<br>challenges for small medium and large<br>businesses across the country sure thing<br>so um i'm glad that i get to define<br>cloud computing so i can shape that the<br>rest of the discussion my my cloud video<br>friends may disagree with my definition<br>but i'll give it a go um the easiest way<br>i think about it is that there's no<br>server in the cupboard like in all the<br>industries that i've worked in there's<br>been this<br>spectre of a server lurking in the<br>cupboard<br>and this was true in health um so<br>certainly still true in health and in<br>some parts it was particularly true with<br>accountants and bookkeepers which is<br>where all the growth and success of xero<br>has really come is through the<br>accounting and bookkeeping industry<br>and that industry grew up with the<br>server under the desk or the the server<br>and the cupboard running desktop<br>software and the the tricky thing about<br>this or the inefficient thing about the<br>accounting industry doing it this way<br>was that a business would have a small<br>business so xero serves typically small<br>businesses or simple businesses<br>would have their own desktop software<br>with their own ledger where they kept<br>all their transactions<br>and then when it came to tax time or any<br>kind of management reporting they'd<br>export the data<br>send that to their accountant and they<br>might send that on disk or they might<br>send it by email later on the accountant<br>would have their own copy of that in<br>their own desktop software and this<br>would basically create the situation<br>where there was a lot of back and forth<br>a lot of inefficient question answering<br>and asking and answering and so on to be<br>able to prepare books to be<br>filed properly for for tax and<br>compliance reasons which is still the<br>most important function that most<br>accountants play although business<br>advisory is a sort of bigger and bigger<br>part for them<br>so the important thing about the cloud<br>is that because there's no server in the<br>cupboard the server has to live<br>somewhere and it lives in the cloud and<br>that means that all of the<br>infrastructure all of the hardware all<br>of the typically all of the operating<br>systems as well these days are taken<br>care of by someone else and that's<br>becoming more and more important<br>particularly for small business<br>customers because the the realities are<br>these days anyone who's trying to run<br>their own server by themselves is very<br>very vulnerable to things like cyber<br>attacks<br>and as governments have woken up more<br>and more to the dangers of that and what<br>happens to personal data<br>privacy controls have increased and<br>these days the penalties for losing<br>someone's data or having it repurposed<br>in some way are pretty severe and<br>they're only going to get more severe<br>and so i think one of the one of the big<br>advantages or opportunities for for our<br>customers at xero is that we take care<br>of all of that for them so all you need<br>is a web browser pointed at the cloud<br>the software's there the part of the<br>business i work in um the other thing<br>that's really important is the ecosystem<br>so this is not just one cloud<br>application xero but it's all of our<br>friend cloud applications and connecting<br>them together is a pretty<br>straightforward exercise used to be<br>quite an expensive thing that would have<br>to be done between computers in<br>different places but these days<br>connecting bits of software together can<br>be easy it can also be very complicated<br>but generally for small business users<br>it's it's not too much of a problem<br>xero was born in the cloud so the the<br>idea of<br>taking what was a traditional desktop<br>software application and instead making<br>it something where an accountant in the<br>business that they're serving share one<br>view of the data<br>and so when the business updates data<br>the accountant can see it when it comes<br>updates the data the business can see it<br>and that just takes out a whole lot of<br>the the pain points and difficulties<br>that that used to exist in the in the<br>premise model of of accounting<br>from a um opportunity perspective though<br>digital literacy cloud literacy so an<br>understanding of it from small business<br>is still pretty small generally speaking<br>the<br>small business economy is about 90 of<br>the global economy so most businesses in<br>the world are small businesses<br>but of those roughly 10<br>of um small businesses who<br>could have an e-commerce front-end um<br>have an e-commerce front-end so roughly<br>10 of small businesses that are involved<br>in retail actually have some kind of<br>e-commerce thing going on so they're<br>digital they're in the cloud<br>whereas in larger firms that's more like<br>25 that still sounds like a small number<br>to me but i think that's quite stark in<br>terms of the challenge for small<br>business there which is really about<br>that awareness and understanding and<br>enablement to be able to find themselves<br>in the cloud<br>thank you<br>teresa could you tell us about how cloud<br>computing is fundamentally changing<br>business financials and i t planning<br>sure so<br>i i basically call on on large banks<br>right so it's a very different type of a<br>customer than what garrosh was just<br>talking about<br>but even if you look at some of the<br>medium-sized companies right<br>you're you're thinking about you know in<br>the past<br>what they would do if they had an i.t<br>project coming up they'd have to plan<br>for it for a whole year or maybe even<br>more<br>make a three year plan<br>and then go to the board ask for funding<br>you know have a plan for how you're<br>going to roll that out<br>and then you'd come to finally being<br>able to purchase<br>uh your hardware your software<br>and your integration teams and and<br>putting all of that together and maybe<br>things have changed in the business<br>right<br>so you know the the the ability to be<br>able to react to what's happening in um<br>your own business is really difficult<br>when you have that longer horizon for<br>planning<br>so that's kind of you know what was<br>happening probably<br>10<br>15 years ago<br>and you know a lot of times you would<br>have people in the organization who were<br>just<br>there to be able to build i.t<br>infrastructure on the back end<br>and it may not have had anything to do<br>with the business that you're in<br>right it was just the table stakes to be<br>able to<br>conduct your business<br>so i think that with cloud computing now<br>that's completely changing it's being<br>flipped on its head<br>right the whole idea of being able to<br>plan<br>a you know in the year<br>deliver<br>quickly in you know what we call sprints<br>and you know and deliver in<br>microservices<br>uh being able to not have to worry about<br>that back end of<br>servers and you know the what you were<br>talking about with the server in the<br>closet or<br>or<br>under the desk or in you know<br>some of these large organizations uh you<br>know a full data center<br>um maintenance and worrying about you<br>know you're planning for that whole<br>um<br>back end<br>you know you you basically are able to<br>outsource that<br>to an organization like<br>i uh google cloud or or like microsoft<br>or aws or any of the other cloud<br>providers<br>and you know they take care of that part<br>and then you're able to focus your<br>effort on<br>you know something that's really<br>valuable um to your business and being<br>able to be more agile and being able to<br>roll out<br>um solutions faster to meet demand of<br>your actual business<br>so i would say that you know the whole<br>financial model around that planning<br>around paying for<br>uh you know hardware<br>uh software<br>and you know and and the model has has<br>basically changed completely because of<br>this way<br>you know to be able to scale differently<br>up and down you know based on what your<br>your business needs<br>so it's really changed quite a bit yeah<br>thank you teresa and and for bringing up<br>um data centers so matt i wonder if you<br>could<br>tell us a little bit or or bring us all<br>on the same page of what is a hyperscale<br>cloud data center and then what are what<br>are the impacts of companies like<br>microsoft investing in building such<br>centers in new zealand<br>two very good questions um<br>so<br>there's there's a bunch of different<br>definitions of what a hyper scale data<br>center is<br>and so we could kind of you know argue<br>about that you know that i've seen some<br>that talk about the square footage you<br>know like<br>10 000 square feet is the size of the<br>building you know and if it's if it's<br>under that it's not hyperscale but<br>um so there's all those different<br>scenarios i think you know for me<br>um<br>when i think about it it's not just<br>about the size or the scale of the<br>building it's a bunch of whole it's a<br>whole bunch of<br>of other different things and maybe it's<br>maybe it's helpful just to kind of paint<br>a picture about what microsoft is doing<br>so people can kind of understand what<br>that means<br>um because what<br>what we are doing is building a<br>hyperscale data center region<br>in aotearoa in new zealand<br>and that's the first thing it's not one<br>data center it's three physical<br>buildings<br>and they're all interconnected with<br>fibre um<br>and the idea is that if the you know the<br>cable to new zealand is cut<br>the fishing boat goes over and<br>pulls up the cable<br>you know the um the internet still works<br>can you believe it like you know your<br>applications that are running<br>uh still work you know your<br>office 365 emails it's still still work<br>you just can't email anyone in australia<br>i'm sorry about that but you can email<br>your friends in new zealand<br>so<br>so that's kind of what we're talking<br>about it's massive scale it's bigger and<br>broader and more complicated than<br>anything<br>we have in new zealand at the moment<br>um so that's<br>that's kind of what hyperscale is and<br>and generally um<br>people talk about the googles to<br>microsoft's the aws is it's it's also<br>part of a global footprint a global<br>fabric<br>and and ultimately<br>it shouldn't really<br>matter and it's it's kind of interesting<br>you know<br>cloud is cloud you know as you said it's<br>kind of where's the server i don't know<br>it doesn't matter it's in the cloud i<br>just need a web browser<br>so<br>so then the next question for me is well<br>if it doesn't matter why why are<br>companies like microsoft and others<br>talking about spending hundreds of<br>millions of dollars to<br>to build that infrastructure here in new<br>zealand so<br>that brings me to the second part of<br>your question which is you know what<br>so what<br>um<br>i kind of feel like it's it's it's a<br>little bit like the internet is finally<br>coming to new zealand<br>i actually do it's like<br>new zealand has got a really high<br>uh<br>propensity for use of cloud and xero is<br>a great example you think about<br>small businesses and accountants and<br>bookkeepers<br>you go to the us<br>they're still using on-prem<br>spreadsheets<br>servers<br>they might have an old copy of another<br>type of um accounting software that's<br>running on a server under their desk<br>it's actually amazing new zealand is one<br>of the you know most cloudified<br>countries on earth and i'm sure you'll<br>back me up i mean we see it with office<br>365.<br>new zealand has got one of the highest<br>adoption rates of office 365 in that<br>small business space of anywhere um in<br>the world and all of<br>that data same with xero today you know<br>we'll sit in australia or singapore or<br>the us or wherever the physical data<br>center might be so<br>what's the big deal why would anyone<br>bother spending all that money to bring<br>it here when we've got a few cables<br>i think there's two reasons<br>probably actually three<br>the first one is data sovereignty and<br>this idea that<br>it's important where the data physically<br>is<br>we could debate this<br>non-stop whether that's actually<br>important<br>what i think is important is the<br>perception that data sovereignty matters<br>whether or not it matters or doesn't<br>matter the perception that it matters<br>has been a blocker that stops companies<br>from taking advantage of all the good<br>things that they can get out of cloud so<br>that's the first one<br>application performance there are some<br>big chatty<br>you know<br>systems of record that<br>uh<br>you know if you were to put them<br>somewhere overseas but all of your other<br>things that you're trying to do are<br>physically located here in new zealand<br>you would get bad performance and so<br>those organizations think mainframes and<br>core banking and the tax system and all<br>those big things that they stay in new<br>zealand<br>you know in an old school legacy tin<br>shed or under the cupboard you know<br>stairs whatever<br>so that application performance<br>is important so we can now<br>take some of those big applications<br>build them in the cloud and start to<br>infuse ai and all these other things<br>that come baked in in cloud<br>and the last one which some people<br>forget but i do think is really really<br>important is sustainability<br>and so<br>when we think about how we're designing<br>the data center region it's not a data<br>center it's a region that is in the<br>region<br>it will be the greenest microsoft data<br>center region anywhere and then the next<br>one that we build will probably be<br>greener again but it will be the most<br>sustainable and<br>you know it's a big part of how we've<br>how we've thought about it that's where<br>you get your electricity from<br>electricity generation it's it's also<br>about the<br>efficiencies you get when you share<br>physical resources<br>and so<br>we've done lots of studies and happy to<br>share share them and work with many<br>organizations that look at that but when<br>you<br>when you look at what the sustainability<br>impact is and the footprint of a<br>business when they move their core<br>computing into<br>true hyperscale cloud<br>it's significantly lower than if you're<br>running all of that stuff yourself so<br>those are probably the three<br>that i think of<br>awesome thank you<br>and so<br>now the the panel so far has been pretty<br>polite you know pretty<br>pretty like matter of fact i'm gonna try<br>to bring in a little more controversy<br>here<br>tony thank you for for agreeing to to<br>let me ask you this question<br>so what were the major promises of cloud<br>computing and how have these panned out<br>yeah it's a fantastic question um thanks<br>daniel<br>i think um the panel's absolutely right<br>and they just describe the advantages of<br>cloud compute and what what it brings or<br>what it could bring<br>um<br>but the reality is not quite<br>as it might seem um if we look back over<br>the last i don't know 10 years of cloud<br>adoption<br>i would characterize that as wave one or<br>chapter one of cloud adoption and we've<br>seen quite a significant change in<br>behaviors within within clients and<br>enterprises as they move to cloud and<br>that's had to happen because<br>the cloud cost paradox and that is where<br>people move to cloud and think they're<br>going to save money and they haven't and<br>so the business case was predicated on a<br>financial winner benefit and it didn't<br>quite pan out<br>and so some of those clients have<br>actually but a bill shock has been<br>experienced and they've moved back but<br>then when you stop and analyze you know<br>why<br>it's because they lifted and shifted<br>they took what they did today in a<br>bricks-and-mortar data center and they<br>moved it<br>and that has no benefit because you're<br>just moving data center<br>effectively a cloud data center is just<br>a data center somebody had to buy<br>compute and put it in racks and run it<br>and operate it and feed power to it and<br>sustainably i love that you raised that<br>the clean green you know electricity<br>generation in new zealand is 80<br>green technology so you can have a green<br>data center and that's an export if we<br>think of cloud computers and export but<br>um<br>what we need to do is shift our mindset<br>because cloud is not about technology<br>per se it's actually what it enables you<br>to do and that's change your mindset and<br>your approach<br>and that's actually what xero has<br>achieved i think<br>in some ways is i've looked at cloud as<br>an opportunity to build a business<br>and do it on a cloud platform and that<br>means they changed their culture and<br>their approach they weren't tied to<br>things they decided to change from a<br>capex model to an opex model<br>and that opex model is is allowing<br>flexibility which is one of those<br>advantages of the cloud so that means<br>you've got to be born on the cloud it's<br>you're looking for cloud native<br>solutions not moving you're existing and<br>putting it in that data center<br>i've worked with many many clients many<br>of them government agencies and i don't<br>think a single one of them saw a cost<br>saving they saw cost increases over the<br>last 10 years and so we need to flip the<br>paradigm so that might sound like i'm<br>anti-cloud but actually i'm not<br>i think it's a hybrid cloud world and i<br>think if we can have help our clients to<br>shift that conversation around culture<br>and mindset and go you know what you've<br>got to modernize you need to start<br>thinking about zeros and how they've<br>achieved it don't move what you have um<br>but i want to ask a question actually of<br>the audience<br>how many as a percentage what percentage<br>of workload and by that i mean servers<br>under the under the desk servers in the<br>cupboard servers and racks how many<br>servers do we think have been moved to<br>the hyperscaler to the cloud<br>as a percentage<br>any other<br>40 wheels or 40 40 yeah any other takers<br>nice<br>yeah it's less<br>it's about 25<br>so when we put it in a global context<br>cloud is an evolution in technology but<br>it isn't the end<br>and it's slow to adopt new zealand i<br>think uri has sort of run it at boots<br>and all and we're and we're we've<br>perhaps moved more workload than other<br>geographies<br>but it's quite interesting to understand<br>that 75 workload is still in<br>either sovereign data centers within<br>within countries or they're in private<br>clouds<br>or they're in sovereign data centers and<br>sovereign clouds they haven't moved to<br>the hyperscaler and and we need to think<br>about how we're going to shift those and<br>those are the people who are wave two<br>that's chapter two and that's really<br>about modernizing those application<br>stacks towards containerized<br>applications if you know what that means<br>and that really is you know i don't<br>think they know<br>hybrid cloud containerized edge<br>computing just bring us all on the same<br>page please let's go back one step<br>in the 90s we used to deploy things in<br>servers under the in the cupboard under<br>the stairs and that was a physical box<br>that we bought and we put an operating<br>system on it and we put a business<br>service on top and consumed it and it<br>was great we did that lots and lots<br>clients might have two or three thousand<br>of these things and then at the end of<br>the 90s a company called vmware appeared<br>and said you know what i want to do that<br>differently and they did something and<br>they virtualized the hardware with a<br>platform that allowed you to run one<br>machine but put lots of little slices of<br>operating system on that machine<br>and that was a hypervisor<br>that hypervisor has now evolved again so<br>in the same way that we've<br>virtualized the hardware with a<br>hypervisor we're now virtualizing the<br>operating system with containers<br>and kubernetes and other platforms are<br>really container orchestration platforms<br>that allow you to do that so why would<br>you do that well the same reason vmware<br>existed you have a one-to-one<br>relationship application to a server and<br>it's not very efficient<br>but if you can go and make a hypervisor<br>for it and put 10 applications on one<br>server you're getting there<br>sustainability and now you need less<br>server engineers because you've got less<br>physical kit<br>but if you can put applications on there<br>and take away the operating system<br>that's a huge saving yeah and if you can<br>do that on a cloud provider<br>that's another saving again<br>i was just going to pick up on that<br>hypervisor thing<br>it's really interesting you know when<br>you talk about how many workloads have<br>gone to cloud<br>when you look<br>at the us<br>as a market and you look at<br>organizations today that are thinking<br>about what their technology future is<br>the roi for them to move to cloud is<br>usually significantly higher than it<br>might be for an organization in new<br>zealand because so many of them haven't<br>gone down that virtualization path<br>compared to percentage-wise in new<br>zealand where a lot of organizations<br>have already done some of that so the<br>the difference between where they are<br>now and what they would get<br>in in cloud from lifting and shifting is<br>not massive but i'm sure we'll talk<br>about<br>where we were all going to go with this<br>because you're absolutely right lift and<br>shift as yesterday's game yeah yeah yes<br>i'll ask maybe one more question around<br>false promises and then i promise we'll<br>get to the future we'll get to the<br>future so theresa what what have you<br>what are you seeing in terms of false<br>promises versus true well i kind of<br>agree with what you were saying around<br>you know people<br>thought oh well we're going to save so<br>much money<br>and it wasn't actually the case it<br>really depends on you know garbage in<br>garbage out right<br>so you weren't modernizing the<br>applications<br>in in<br>you know prior to to transferring them<br>over to the cloud<br>so you actually do need to have that<br>modernization process<br>uh as and and think about your business<br>you know slightly differently the other<br>thing<br>that i think was a false promise was<br>that oh we're just going to put<br>something in the cloud and<br>and we're done right this is we're<br>modern now that's it<br>we're ready to go<br>but it actually doesn't work that way<br>right you you need to be<br>um<br>developing in the cloud you you need to<br>be<br>modernizing your<br>processes<br>uh with your with your workforce right<br>you<br>you need to be modernizing how you work<br>together and how you innovate<br>um for bringing<br>new applications in<br>so if we've we've really seen it it was<br>really more of a process<br>challenge<br>uh<br>and and changing the way that you work<br>and then the the other thing was you<br>know really around modern modernizing<br>what you're bringing into the cloud<br>as you're going into that journey to<br>really get the benefit of what you're<br>able to do<br>in your digitalization<br>plan<br>okay<br>and<br>i think maybe we'll we'll turn a little<br>bit to the future now gareth could you<br>tell us about what you're seeing in<br>terms of update uptake and trends<br>yeah sure well so the the obvious<br>starting point is that you know the<br>world's been a little different for the<br>last couple of years<br>and<br>one of the things about being forced to<br>work from home which a lot of businesses<br>were or just not having access to<br>physical premises suddenly makes the<br>benefits of having software in the cloud<br>pretty obvious<br>so a lot of with xero certainly we saw a<br>big uptick in the number of<br>i suppose taking<br>taking<br>traditional<br>accounting records or<br>e-commerce instances or anything like<br>that any any kind of software system<br>that was on premise into the cloud it<br>was certainly an incentive for people<br>realizing that you know maybe life was<br>going to be a little bit different and<br>it was a real benefit to be able to just<br>point a browser at something and be able<br>to carry on<br>that was a big driver<br>whereas new zealand is interesting for<br>us because we started here<br>and so new zealand has has you know as<br>you pointed out the<br>much better adoption perhaps than some<br>other places we actually did some<br>research some behavioral research on<br>people in all of our different<br>geographic markets<br>new zealand and australia are the big<br>markets for xero but the uk is not far<br>behind and they were also active in u.s<br>and canada and things and<br>one of the things that that really came<br>out of it was that in new zealand and<br>australia there are many more adopters<br>so they sort of put it into adopters and<br>delays looked at small businesses and<br>said you know how how sort of cloud<br>ready are these businesses digital ready<br>of these businesses<br>and um you know new zealand and<br>australia were more prepared but it was<br>still only about 20<br>so when we actually surveyed businesses<br>and said you know who if you are just<br>ready to get right into this sort of<br>thing boots and all it was still only<br>about that 20 mark which is constantly<br>very similar to the sort of movements<br>cloud and things of of uh server<br>infrastructure<br>the kinds of<br>barriers to that the things that make it<br>hard for people is actually trying to<br>understand what the options are that are<br>out there so you know if you're a small<br>business and<br>you're talking about the core business<br>before<br>you want to be doing your small business<br>you don't want to be mucking around with<br>other things and you certainly don't<br>want to have to learn everything there<br>is to know about technology just to be<br>able to make progress and so<br>when you're confronted with a just a<br>raft of different options and<br>possibilities and all those sorts of<br>things it makes it really really hard<br>and that's a significant obstacle and<br>what's compounding that i think for us<br>now we're certainly finding this as a<br>business and we know our customers are<br>as well is there's a big skill shortage<br>and a really big knowledge shortage so<br>trying to find people who can actually<br>understand and help and sort through all<br>that all those possible options<br>is getting is getting very difficult and<br>it's it's staying difficult so that's a<br>significant barrier really to to<br>businesses being able to do that<br>one of the things that is um helping us<br>here in new zealand and australia<br>and the uk it's helping zero as a<br>business but i'd like to think it's<br>helping us all make progress as well is<br>that governments are really getting on<br>board with this as well so they're<br>they're driving they recognize that they<br>can reduce costs for all of us as<br>taxpayers if they<br>either mandate or drive or incentivize<br>the use of these kinds of technologies<br>in business processes so inland revenue<br>here the australian tax office in<br>australia the authorities in the uk and<br>singapore and other places all have big<br>programs of work where they're basically<br>pushing businesses to do the kind of<br>cloud-based digital integration and as a<br>reward for that if you like they make it<br>a lot easier for those businesses to be<br>able to get on with doing things they<br>need to do in terms of filing tax and<br>things so so that government driven<br>transformation is actually it's a big<br>tailwind for all of us as well cool<br>and matt what are you seeing in terms of<br>transformations around aotearoa<br>yeah there's there's plenty um i want to<br>mention probably the most exciting and<br>it goes back to what you see at the<br>start around the um prime minister's<br>recent trade mission to the u.s and i'll<br>touch on that<br>so<br>here's a question i like the way you<br>who can tell me what is the number one<br>you're disqualified did i hear someone<br>say dairy<br>yeah congratulations that is number one<br>so<br>so we basically in the past have made<br>our money by being lucky that we live in<br>a rainy part of the world<br>and we have reasonable soils now<br>that can grow grass and then we get<br>these cows and we put them on the grass<br>the rain and the grass grows and then we<br>milk the cows and<br>but that you know climate change could<br>impact that consumer um decisions could<br>impact that sustainability of the soil<br>and you know putting nitrates into grow<br>grass could impact that<br>who can tell me what the second most i<br>it was tourism but it's not<br>education was in there but that it's not<br>that anymore our second biggest export<br>earner is<br>is tech<br>so all we need to do interesting in the<br>future to be prosperous and happy and<br>live wonderful lives is just have lots<br>of really smart people<br>creating<br>ip<br>and then selling that ip weightlessly<br>there's no ships or<br>airplanes or anything that you need<br>weightlessly selling it to the rest of<br>the world and we've got some great<br>examples<br>gareth like zero of organizations that<br>do that incredibly well<br>so that's the most exciting change in<br>the shift that i've seen and what i<br>think the prime minister did<br>in taking that delegation to the us and<br>spending time<br>in seattle when was the last time a new<br>zealand prime minister went to seattle<br>why seattle because it's the home of<br>microsoft it's the home of amazon<br>um you know it's it's it's one of the<br>big exciting burgeoning tech hubs and so<br>we were really lucky we were able to<br>host the prime minister for a day at<br>microsoft talking about ai and ethics<br>talking about cyber security actually<br>she spent an awful lot of time talking<br>about cyber security and what the impact<br>of that is on on nations<br>by the way microsoft uh has eight and a<br>half thousand cyber security<br>professionals and 24 trillion<br>cyber security signals every day that<br>they're dealing with and and in april<br>microsoft released a paper<br>that said that they had actually seen an<br>increase in cyber attacks on ukraine<br>from russian aligned actors that gave<br>them<br>reason to believe that a physical<br>land-based attack was imminent and they<br>rang a few people and said hey<br>this is what's happening because they<br>were able to see what was happening in<br>in that cyber attack space so<br>that's probably the most exciting thing<br>for me new zealand as a<br>exporter of<br>technology of ip built on technology<br>and that's another reason why i think<br>it's really exciting to have some of the<br>physical infrastructure here you know<br>those physical<br>data centers you know as a developer as<br>an innovator you can have an idea on<br>monday and build it in your backyard and<br>release it to the world at the click of<br>a button on tuesday and so<br>so that's kind of cool um the just a<br>couple of others<br>that i'd love to touch on<br>the way we work is changing the way we<br>buy sell and transact is changing and<br>that's all<br>pandemic led so you think about zoom and<br>teams and<br>hybrid work and all that stuff<br>that's pretty crazy the skills challenge<br>can i just say that this is not a this<br>is not a talent issue<br>we have incredible talented people in<br>new zealand it's actually a diversity<br>issue<br>because only 27 of people in tech are<br>women four percent himalayan less than<br>three percent are pacific people so now<br>if we want to solve the skills challenge<br>we actually need to broaden the pool of<br>people who are thinking about technology<br>as a career as an option<br>because um<br>i've been lucky enough with microsoft we<br>work with tupatoa who's an organization<br>that brings maori and pacifica interns<br>into tech and i've i've worked with a<br>number of interns i can tell you they're<br>amazing technologists<br>but no one had ever said here's a way<br>for you to<br>have a pathway into tech<br>until<br>tuputala came along and did that so<br>that's cool<br>um the other thing i was going to say is<br>rapid increase in the use of ai<br>and infusing it into business processes<br>and using ai to do things not to replace<br>humans but to<br>augment humans and a great example is<br>some work that we're doing with<br>landcare research manaki whenua<br>around using ai to look at<br>land use and<br>changes in forest cover<br>you know satellites and images and ai<br>engines and all that good kind of stuff<br>which then turns into predictions around<br>what happens with<br>with sustainability and all that good<br>kind of stuff so<br>um i think probably the last thing i<br>would say<br>is<br>teams<br>so t microsoft teams started life as a<br>kind of a video conferencing platform<br>uh well that's how people would have<br>experienced it and a lot of people would<br>have experienced that during the<br>pandemic i think you know we had a 13<br>times<br>growth in teams usage in a couple of<br>years you know from 20 million to<br>270 something million in a very short<br>period of time but what it is now is<br>effectively an operating<br>system<br>that brings a whole lot of different<br>things<br>into one place and a good example of<br>that is i get told every day<br>how i could be more effective<br>through ai baked into teams that's<br>telling me who i'm talking to how much<br>time i spend talking to different people<br>in my team where i'm putting my effort<br>and my focus whether i was<br>distracted in meetings by emailing<br>i get an email from<br>an ai machine that says here's three<br>things you could do to be a more<br>effective person in your job<br>and so<br>all of that stuff being baked into the<br>tools that we use<br>to me that's that's a really interesting<br>scenario and we're doing some work with<br>new zealand organizations that are<br>starting to build that into their own<br>platforms so there's a few ideas<br>yeah yeah no we can<br>i i could uh continue a conversation<br>like for hours on how like people's<br>lives are changing with those tools and<br>uh the kind of mental models and the way<br>people understand those suggestions<br>yeah very very fascinating but<br>i did want to ask tony from a technology<br>point of view<br>what what trends are you seeing there<br>and where where do you see us in the<br>future<br>us being nz or technology generally oh i<br>think both both would be great<br>um firstly uh yeah exactly right um<br>ai is is critical um but it doesn't<br>replace humans or it shouldn't replace<br>humans um a few years ago<br>there was a lot of<br>language i suppose in the media and<br>conversation around watercolors that ai<br>was actually going to automate my job<br>and i would be out of a job and there'd<br>be a devolution of roles and eventually<br>you know people would end up slipping<br>down the stack and a lollipop man gets<br>made redundant<br>because now a computer science grad is<br>turning the sign and actually that's not<br>true um<br>what's actually happening is to talk<br>about something um that matt mentioned<br>as well is our people on skills shortage<br>we do have a shortage and i'm going to<br>give you some stats in a minute um so<br>really automation is going to be the<br>thing that keeps us operating so um i<br>will talk to a client and they'll say<br>something like i'm losing my staff and<br>my skills and capability in certain<br>areas and i need to augment that and<br>what they really need to do is automate<br>their environments they need to automate<br>everything to make up for the shortfall<br>and skills in people so um let's give<br>you some stats because it's quite dire<br>um<br>ict is an industry in all western<br>countries right now 40 roughly of those<br>ict workers are actually baby boomers<br>and this is not boomer bashing<br>this is illustrating a problem<br>i'm a<br>gen gen x and there's about 38 39 of us<br>in the ict industry which is good but<br>that leaves 20<br>for all the others<br>so where's our skills and talent coming<br>up through those generations to take<br>over so the leaders of tomorrow<br>are going to inherit a workforce that is<br>probably about 40 smaller and that's<br>going to happen around 2025 2026 when 90<br>of baby boomers will be eligible for<br>retirement eligible maybe not take it<br>but will be eligible<br>there are certain industries sectors<br>perhaps<br>um<br>some based in wellington that we won't<br>name out right yeah that percentage is<br>really high<br>like 70<br>and they're facing an evacuation of<br>people in an order of 50 in the next<br>three years<br>and they are the same organizations that<br>are charged with transformations<br>and driving new digital services for<br>citizens so where is where's the<br>workforce coming from and that's the big<br>question and that's why we have to keep<br>kids in stem and we have to keep them<br>growing into tertiary and pathways and<br>ibm has a program that's called p-tech<br>that does that<br>for lower decile schools and we call<br>these new collar workers where we don't<br>bring them to uni we get them ready for<br>work at 18 straight into the workforce<br>that's the primary objective<br>um nothing wrong with university though<br>no not business<br>we're helping<br>president can be accepted<br>and and those sorts of programs are<br>going to be really really critical but<br>private industry can only do so much<br>um government needs to legislate and<br>that means we need to grow our tech<br>economy because a it's a really good<br>export and p we've got to grow we've got<br>to grow our people into into stem<br>related research and areas for our<br>economy to continue and that's really<br>critical so um<br>what do i see is tech emerging<br>perhaps we'll pivot a little bit<br>cloud is really the future but it's<br>going to change it's not going to look<br>like what we have now<br>so whilst wave one has been a bit of hit<br>and miss<br>uh wave two is really where we're<br>putting on our bets and i know i think<br>it's going to look different to what we<br>have remember what i said cloud is not a<br>destination it's a journey you keep<br>going and technology is going to<br>continue to evolve so the hyperscaler<br>view we have now in five years will be<br>different and two ways that's going to<br>change will be industry clouds um<br>industry clouds are already here they're<br>already present ibm can give you a<br>financial services industry cloud today<br>and that's distinct to a hyperscaler<br>cloud which is i think t-shirt sizes you<br>need a thing it's a commodity service<br>it's a t-shirt size not all industries<br>regulatory industries for example around<br>financial services can achieve that so<br>if you're a bank you can become a<br>virtual bank<br>and not require any of the servers<br>underneath the desk and you could do<br>that on a ibm cloud<br>the other way it's going to change is<br>the cloud is going to devolve to the<br>edge so at the moment we're centralizing<br>everything's coming into these massive<br>data centers so make no mistake somebody<br>still runs the tin it's still sucking<br>power that's right but now you don't<br>have to worry about it or buy it but now<br>it's going to devolve back up to the<br>edge because guess where all our data is<br>generated<br>and the edge so if you're a<br>manufacturing plant and you run<br>equipment and you want to manage that<br>equipment<br>it's going to have sensors and process<br>logic controllers all over it and<br>they're all data points and you don't<br>want to aggregate that to your cloud<br>maybe for cost maybe because you haven't<br>got enough bandwidth there's just too<br>much of it what do you do with all this<br>stuff you're going to want to keep it at<br>the edge and use it at the edge<br>and so that's starting to become a real<br>a real thing<br>how can we take what was the domain of<br>the hyperscaler an exponential service<br>an ai based capability and how can we<br>take a miniature version of that and<br>push that to the edge consumer data<br>point and get a business outcome and<br>that's really two of the big sort of<br>swings i see over the next few years<br>but we have to fix our talent and skills<br>gap first<br>um great<br>and so i was going to open it up to the<br>audience now but if there were some<br>words that you wanted to if there was<br>something that you wanted to fit in<br>first<br>you know the the approach i liked the<br>approach so<br>i'm going to ask you all<br>who uses google maps<br>in this room<br>do you use it every day<br>yeah<br>can you even imagine yourself like<br>getting somewhere without one<br>a google map<br>right<br>it's just become part of what what we do<br>right<br>every day we walk out with our phone<br>you know and we map where we're going<br>get guess what what happens to that<br>information<br>yeah<br>well i mean and and what about when you<br>you're trying to find information<br>about something on the internet what do<br>you do<br>you google it right so<br>so all of all of that input right that's<br>input that's those data points that you<br>talked about<br>every single time you are<br>googling something every time you map a<br>location<br>all of that becomes a data point right<br>and all of that becomes part of this<br>ecosystem in the cloud<br>that provides additional information to<br>you<br>and benefit to you<br>but then we<br>as google<br>would take that<br>and and develop<br>more innovation<br>right innovative ways to do different<br>things<br>um<br>raise your hand if you've heard of<br>okay<br>so a few people have heard of google<br>earth engine so you you know that's<br>that's basically a project that started<br>you know as a side project we call it at<br>10x thinking at google and you know we<br>we have these<br>um<br>projects on the side<br>and that is now coming mainstream<br>and it's it's actually photographing<br>the earth right<br>so it then will what we'd be able to do<br>with a lot of that information<br>is bring it back to something like<br>sustainable<br>farming right or<br>potentially in the um housing<br>market you know with understanding<br>valuations better<br>you know in the market without needing<br>to you know have expensive processes in<br>order to do that right it's actually<br>captured<br>uh right in in<br>google earth<br>so i you know i suppose that you know<br>it's it's really<br>about your imagination of what comes<br>next with those kinds of technologies<br>that are already out there that you use<br>every day<br>but then how would you bring that in<br>and and and<br>you know talking about you know what<br>what what could be possible right<br>and you know maybe you know you come up<br>with the idea of how better to use that<br>and i i think that that is what really<br>makes something like cloud computing and<br>some of these applications so<br>interesting<br>is how we might be able to improve<br>our time on the earth right and<br>and be able to make more money or less<br>money or<br>or make things more efficient<br>so<br>um i just wanted to kind of close by<br>just saying that um<br>you know really that innovation is you<br>know up to every single one of you right<br>you you can make the difference and you<br>can probably pull together you know some<br>amazing way<br>you know to solve some of these problems<br>that we're going to be facing over the<br>next<br>few years<br>a lot of the technology is already there<br>in the cloud<br>so<br>any any more comments before i<br>they say the questions yeah yeah<br>questions from<br>yes<br>so the numbers that i forget who quoted<br>about in terms of transferring to<br>the cloud<br>were really low<br>are there any obvious<br>reasons for this as it's purely not<br>invented here or fear of the unknown or<br>is there something else going on was it<br>capacity is that the um 25 workload<br>yeah<br>no um<br>yeah it's really complex you can't um<br>cloud makes it appear that is that the<br>industry is simplifying things for you<br>and as an end consumer maybe it has but<br>actually it's really complicated um and<br>in fact it's more complex now than it<br>ever has been<br>and organizations that have grown up<br>perhaps evolved organically they've got<br>a really complex environment<br>and some of those are massive<br>shifting that to cloud unpicking 20<br>years of organic development<br>is really complex it takes a very long<br>time and so<br>it's not cost effective<br>here's an interesting stat i'll throw<br>this out there um<br>telcos 70 of all telcos today still run<br>their core business because they're a<br>transaction based business on a<br>mainframe<br>yeah<br>it's kind of interesting<br>on a mainframe does xero<br>maintain their own data centers or do<br>they outsource no so we're on public<br>cloud so we use aws for okay for our<br>infrastructure yeah but when you because<br>we tell you these different layers of uh<br>cloud cloud yeah cloud is a very<br>nebulous term<br>include software as a service yeah<br>what's so healthy<br>and yeah the cost didn't go down but<br>they did start to go down as that<br>the business of using the cloud and the<br>way that it's intended to be used yeah<br>moving the workload i mean<br>for me at least the the the internet is<br>just another software distribution<br>mechanism<br>and if you look at the cloud services as<br>just another way of delivering software<br>to people now whether that's low level<br>software where you're kind of<br>micromanaging exactly how all the<br>transactions are managed and everything<br>or whether you're handing over to a<br>service such as xero<br>which kind of<br>i guess standardizes the process uh you<br>know how things are handled and it's<br>it's all just software distribution<br>yeah<br>yeah just um summarizing for our live<br>stream viewers of that the internet is<br>software uh as a service yeah yeah<br>and there was another question yeah yeah<br>so firstly um it was mentioned that um<br>xero started off from<br>using an optics like kind of model and<br>then like sorry capex kind of model and<br>then they pivoted to optics so i come<br>what what like what time inspires like<br>um subject change like how how um<br>how were the like right leaders sure<br>that it was going to benefit the<br>business and the long term<br>so zero moving from a capex to an opex<br>model yeah i could repeat that question<br>back if you like so yeah the change that<br>happened was<br>that the traditional industry so the way<br>that the accounting industry used<br>desktop software and um and those sorts<br>of solutions that was a capex model so<br>so you had uh you know your typical<br>accounting practice or a small medium<br>business would have to<br>to your point yeah<br>plan and plan for the the hardware the<br>infrastructure the people to do the work<br>and so on to install the software pay<br>probably upfront license costs and those<br>sorts of things what xero did was to<br>take a very traditional industry like<br>that and offer instead a<br>subscription-based cloud-based service<br>so that the only real installation<br>required for a small business is point<br>your browser at the thing and put your<br>credit card in of course as well but the<br>um<br>the<br>the way that that happened was<br>recognizing what kind of opportunity was<br>coming in that wave one of cloud like<br>there was something<br>there so looking and the way that rod<br>drew<br>the one who founded it was looking at it<br>was he was basically looking for an<br>industry that he knew was<br>behind and<br>often looked at<br>in dismissive terms like oh they'll<br>never really you know come along with us<br>this will be the last industry that<br>anyone modernizes kind of thing which<br>was untrue and the you know the industry<br>was actually ready for a different way<br>of doing things in small businesses<br>capital is always a constraint you know<br>so it's really tough it you if you<br>running any kind of small business<br>you're always watching how much money is<br>in the bank and it's really hard to get<br>more money to pay for big purchases so<br>to take out what used to be a big<br>purchase and turn that into just<br>something that you do month or month is<br>a you know a really helpful sort of<br>transformation but yeah that's that's an<br>entrepreneur looking at you know here's<br>a an old system here's a new way it<br>could be<br>and taking a bit that they were more<br>ready than everyone thought they they<br>might be<br>right yes<br>uh first of all thanks very much for<br>your time um<br>so you were talking about how microsoft<br>is is currently building a bunch of<br>hyper centers i'm interested in moving a<br>lot of those<br>data centers onto you know closer to<br>where your customers would be<br>how much of that<br>you were saying before that some of it<br>is to do with performance where you can<br>increase speed and then some of the data<br>security i can imagine as well um<br>these days we're wanting to kind of make<br>supply chains more robust and move<br>things back onto onshoring a lot of<br>stuff how much of the decision to build<br>is like is is the performance uh just a<br>happy accident or is it the other way<br>around<br>what is the kind of thinking behind why<br>you move a data center to new zealand<br>yeah location of data centers yeah it's<br>interesting when i started at microsoft<br>the closest microsoft cloud data center<br>region was in singapore<br>and we were going to talk to<br>organizations and say you know how<br>you're running that um that really<br>inefficient<br>exchange server under the desk and you<br>know someone's job is to just patch it<br>and look at it and make sure it works<br>well how about you don't do that<br>put everything into office 365 and just<br>you know have this magic of you know the<br>the software distributed on the internet<br>and we'll upgrade it and we'll manage it<br>and we'll patch it and we'll secure it<br>and everyone went oh singapore okay<br>that's fine<br>and then<br>kind of it came a little bit closer when<br>it came to australia<br>and everyone said oh i want to put my<br>stuff in australia i don't want it in<br>singapore i'm like yeah but it's the<br>cloud who cares it just works doesn't<br>matter you don't need to worry about it<br>and then<br>you know a few<br>years later it was like oh no new<br>zealand's next and then what will be<br>next is<br>that capability<br>going into<br>closer and closer to where the<br>the the<br>the compute<br>you know transaction happens you know<br>we're working with fonterra around<br>building iot sensors that go into milk<br>bats and onto trucks and<br>start to use ai to think about how they<br>can optimize uh reduce carbon footprint<br>in terms of fleet management and and how<br>you can give better insights into what's<br>happening on the farm and<br>all that kind of stuff so ultimately you<br>might then have as tony said elements of<br>that compute capability infused right at<br>the edge right you know at the farm gate<br>it still might be part of a fabric<br>but that fabric is kind of you know<br>spreading and getting you know further<br>and further out there's lots of things<br>that sit in behind the business<br>decision<br>to do it<br>but ultimately you know it's a<br>it's a it's a rational kind of roi<br>decision that says if we build this data<br>center will<br>people use it will it get filled up<br>one of the things that i was<br>worth just mentioning idc did some work<br>around what the growth in cloud public<br>cloud revenues will be in new zealand i<br>think<br>it was about 1.7 billion in 2020 it's<br>going to be three something in 2024 but<br>what's really interesting about that so<br>so there's your roi um<br>and if you put some data centers in here<br>you might you might speed up that<br>adoption curve you might get more<br>organizations putting more of their<br>stuff so you go from 25 to 30 or 35<br>but what was really interesting about<br>that is if you look at the breakdown of<br>what makes up those<br>those cloud revenues in 2020 a big chunk<br>of it was infrastructure as a service<br>and a smaller chunk was platform as a<br>service and software as a service and as<br>we get into 2024 the stuff that's<br>growing really fast<br>is the platform and the software as a<br>service yeah the stuff that's kind of<br>not growing very fast as the<br>infrastructure so<br>my prediction is in the future<br>cloud computing won't be<br>virtualized machines<br>with stuff running on them it'll be a<br>whole lot of<br>software as a service elements that are<br>stitched together in a smart little way<br>and then customized for an individual<br>business a bit like what you said about<br>an industry cloud i totally agree<br>so<br>we can see that happening already and<br>the analysts are kind of with us on that<br>i hope that gives you a bit of an<br>insight into it<br>yes and that is a an excellent note to<br>maybe tie up this portion of the evening<br>but we'll we'll have a chance to to chat<br>a little bit more uh but because we<br>we've passed the 7 30 mark i would love<br>to invite you to join me in thanking our<br>panel<br>exceptional thank you so much<br>yes<br>thank you<br>and let's let's keep chatting<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
