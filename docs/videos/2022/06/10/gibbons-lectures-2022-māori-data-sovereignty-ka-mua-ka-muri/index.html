about<br>what's going to happen tonight<br>i would like to<br>thank professor jill dolby for<br>organizing another excellent series<br>gibson<br>lecture series<br>so the topic is excellent<br>we have also excellent speakers so far i<br>think the one coming will be also<br>fantastic so thank you jill for all the<br>other work and also the team that has<br>been helping you in<br>setting this up<br>so<br>um<br>what else so i would like also to thank<br>the sponsors for supporting the the<br>event because<br>you know it's uh always<br>good to have extra uh extra support and<br>also for sharing the the news of you<br>know this event happening so thanks to<br>them for<br>helping us out<br>so<br>i am the head of the school of computer<br>science so<br>um<br>this event basically is hosted by<br>bioschool but<br>you know the main idea is to try to<br>organize a series that can<br>help people understanding the topics in<br>computer science i mean we as experts<br>more or less kind of you know we deal<br>with this stuff almost every day but<br>because computer science is getting um<br>you know so relevant to every day's<br>people life so that is important that<br>people understand where they're engaging<br>with with devices and technology what's<br>happening and cloud computing basically<br>is one of uh you know those technologies<br>that everybody talks about everybody<br>gets for granted it's like your mobile<br>phone or you know every internet<br>connection but 95 of people out there<br>really don't know what what the heck is<br>going on behind the scene<br>and the other five percent are making a<br>lot of money out of that<br>so<br>it's important that when we engage with<br>uh with this kind of technology right i<br>mean that uh we basically have<br>some kind of idea of<br>what consequence might happen later on<br>so cloud computing if you were with us<br>last week when uh<br>david ayers president<br>gave the first lecture introducing the<br>concept it's very cool idea right i mean<br>basically what you're trying to do or<br>what organization do is to<br>outsource<br>uh<br>data and computation to a third party so<br>it's much cheaper you pay for what<br>you're using for but there is also<br>another cost a hidden cost that is<br>basically you also source it to a second<br>to a third party the handling of your<br>data and nowadays data is the most<br>uh<br>important currencies that as a user we<br>have i mean before you know<br>software was the the most important kind<br>of things that the organization would<br>try to uh or us that the organization<br>will try to<br>exploit for making money let's say but<br>nowadays basically software doesn't<br>uncount for much i mean you get a lot of<br>free service out there<br>the caveat there is basically you know<br>every free service that you get is also<br>asking for data about you and collecting<br>this data then it's used for whatever<br>purpose the organization behind the<br>scene<br>are<br>uh they would like basically to do with<br>that with that information<br>so<br>tonight to basically we are going to<br>talk about the specific uh<br>specific topic in in the cloud computer<br>it is around the<br>data sovereignty and more specifically<br>maori data sovereignty<br>so<br>i will be introducing the<br>uh chair or facilitator of the of the<br>evening dr<br>daniel wilson so daniel has been<br>a part of the school for<br>three years now so working with um<br>with with us and um is involved in<br>serious in several uh kind of research<br>projects so he's a part of the tikanga<br>in technology project together with the<br>kiri and<br>maui and also is a part of<br>the te mana rauranga network so which is<br>the maori data surrounding the network<br>together with the rest of the panel so<br>i will shut up now i will pass the<br>button to<br>uh daniel for<br>let the panel finalist introducing<br>themselves that's good<br>you know delegation and enjoy the<br>evening thank you<br>um<br>it's a really great pleasure to have<br>these awesome panelists with me<br>so<br>nice to work with you all<br>um i just wanted to um give them some of<br>the things that we're going to get into<br>i just wanted to start with a with the<br>kadakia<br>okay i just before we get into the panel<br>itself i just wanted to<br>mention a couple of people who have<br>passed away recently<br>um so<br>joe hawk<br>who's one of the<br>komata one of the leaders<br>of ngati parka or k has passed away<br>recently<br>he was<br>instrumental<br>in the the bastion point<br>um<br>occupation<br>and today is the the anniversary 25th of<br>may of when the police raided after<br>something like 506 days<br>and destroyed the buildings that were<br>there and arrested 222 protesters and<br>sort of sparked<br>i mean it's part of a continuum of maori<br>land rights that ended up<br>with the waitangi tribunal returning<br>some of the land including<br>bastian point uh as well as the<br>settlement so<br>uh<br>i wanted to mention acknowledge joe hawk<br>also<br>mariam barbaric<br>recently passed away as well so about a<br>year ago i was on a<br>maori data sovereignty panel in relation<br>to ai with miriam<br>and she's done a<br>great amount of work so she was<br>co-founder of<br>um<br>idiot indigenous design and innovation<br>aotearoa<br>and she also created a collaborative<br>so<br>the theme<br>of today's sort of panel discussion is<br>kamua<br>muri<br>and the images of walking backwards into<br>the future so the future is located<br>behind us<br>we don't necessarily have a clear view<br>of this but we do<br>have an understanding of the past and we<br>can pick up the lessons and the values<br>of the past and use that to guide<br>our journey into the future<br>so the history and dynamics of the past<br>can help us<br>move<br>in a safe sort of way<br>into the future<br>so i just wanted to<br>relate what we're talking about today<br>two things like the maori land movement<br>of the 1970s<br>because similarly there was discussion<br>around<br>maori land rights now we're talking<br>about maori data rights<br>themes of justice<br>with the maori land<br>movement<br>there was a catch cry of not one more<br>acre<br>and now you're seeing chapters of not<br>one more bite<br>so there's lots of resonances<br>and the kinds of values uh in search for<br>justice and equity<br>in these different movements<br>um now the tech landscape here in<br>aotearoa is also it's fairly recent so<br>looking at peter gibbons's profile he<br>got a degree in 1972 which was a masters<br>in science and computer science well<br>that's in the scheme of things just 50<br>years ago and that was the the first<br>degree computer science degree awarded<br>so even in that 50 years you know things<br>are really accelerating<br>in terms of<br>so we now have the adoption of<br>artificial intelligence to inform<br>decision making<br>in various industries and government<br>services<br>health for instance but also in social<br>services and the development of cloud<br>computing<br>and so forth<br>all right so without<br>further ado i'll move on to the panel<br>we've got<br>kitty maui and lara and uh<br>we'll just do a little<br>our short<br>a senior lecturer in politics and public<br>policy at the university of auckland so<br>your colleague even though you might not<br>have seen me around the last two years<br>have been rather yeah tricky<br>and i i come to this topic um currently<br>i'm working on a couple of projects<br>relating to it um one that's<br>looking in the integrated data<br>infrastructure you know stats nz<br>administrative data looking at maori who<br>don't know the ewing which is actually<br>inspired by my grandfather who's from<br>the taranaki region<br>and another project that is kind of<br>asking maori just why we enroll on the<br>maori role or general role qualitative<br>survey project that is underway kind of<br>in development it's getting there it's<br>getting there i've also worked on the<br>new zealand election study and i've<br>recently been appointed to an<br>independent<br>review on electoral law reform in<br>foreign<br>um yeah just wanted to<br>say my name is marwie hudson<br>primary affiliation to whakatur here<br>which is down around the portuguese and<br>i bring that up in the context of what<br>daniel was talking about about joe hawk<br>raghi nui walker was<br>one of our rangatira from fakatori but<br>also part of the university of auckland<br>and one of his<br>books was kapha tonemato<br>and it was that context around land<br>rights<br>and so i think there's that<br>that aspect of it which continues to run<br>through just as as daniel had spoken<br>about and i just acknowledge um<br>what's happening up at odaki the moment<br>because that was also where rangino<br>after he passed away and so the<br>relationship between fakato here and<br>ngati father was a strong one and we had<br>some of our to go visit him this morning<br>but<br>outside of that i'm at the university of<br>waikato just come up the road<br>uh big night in town<br>so uh looking forward to that but um<br>you've been involved with maori data<br>sovereignty for a long time<br>i'm glad this is like a public thing i'm<br>so<br>caught a little bit because i i<br>understand it's for the public but<br>there's like these computer science<br>people here<br>and i trained as a physio so i don't<br>know where that kind of puts me in the<br>context of all these things but um i<br>think the<br>uh it is<br>really interesting to to do as sort of<br>daniel said look back and see what sorts<br>of things we can take<br>out of the way uh which people managed<br>resources and thought about<br>those things<br>that belong to the collectible belongs<br>to society<br>and then use that as a way for thinking<br>about how we're dealing with things now<br>as it starts to kind of get pulled away<br>into kind of bigger global environments<br>i am a lecturer here in<br>um the bachelor of communication i'm<br>doing indigenous communications um<br>and i just recently submitted my phd<br>which was sort of<br>really focused yeah thank you<br>yeah looking at um sort of theorizing<br>marijuana sovereignty in altera<br>and i am like giovanni said working on a<br>project<br>with maui and daniel more directly um<br>technology<br>um decolonizing algorithms which is<br>crazy space for me to be in because i do<br>have a background in sort of sociology<br>and ethics and not in computer science<br>so it's a bit of<br>a bit of a mind shift for me um<br>but yeah i'm kind of<br>i'm a real baby in this space i like to<br>think the same thing<br>um<br>i'm interested in this conversation<br>that's me<br>good<br>okay shall we get into some questions<br>mainstream discussions around status<br>stewardship and data sovereignty<br>um so<br>the discussions that are currently out<br>there around data sovereignty are<br>international but how does that differ<br>from maori data sovereignty what are the<br>uh<br>commonalities what are the what are the<br>gaps<br>yeah sure so<br>everyone was looking at me so i'm going<br>to start<br>yes so so it is interesting and i think<br>you know think about<br>indigenous data sovereignty and maori<br>data sovereignty<br>it's you know it's a new term you know<br>people haven't been talking about it<br>it's only been the last sort of five or<br>six years<br>and i know this because i was part of<br>the group that coined it<br>and it was you know it had this um<br>really nice thing because all these<br>things we've been talking about with you<br>know joe hawk and ranginui walker<br>fights for rights all about sovereignty<br>um<br>gets all the<br>all the all the maori groups really<br>excited and you add data to it and it's<br>like oh that's pretty interesting<br>but data sovereignty is actually a cloud<br>computing term and there's probably some<br>cloud computing people here that can<br>sort of talk about that<br>and what it meant was that data was<br>subject to the laws of the nation within<br>which the data is stored<br>so so i always go to<br>you know when i'm talking with the group<br>saying well you know when they<br>the data's in the cloud it's not sort of<br>really up there it's sitting on a server<br>on someone's land<br>and the whole context around<br>as i understood the data sovereignty<br>arguments was about<br>a lot around when the patriot act came<br>into play<br>and so the government could go and start<br>searching all of the data that was<br>sitting that was sitting on there you<br>know on their land<br>and the europeans didn't like the<br>americans looking through all of their<br>data sources<br>and so they started shifting them off<br>the russians don't want the americans to<br>look at all their data and so you end up<br>in the situation where that's actually<br>what it referred to<br>and we were you know saying well you<br>know it doesn't feel right to us that<br>you know our data just because it's<br>sitting over there is now subject to<br>american law or you know where it was<br>but it should be subject to outlaws and<br>then if we extended that to tribal<br>nations or ewe or tribal nations but if<br>we're putting our data in places too our<br>rules should inform how it gets used<br>and<br>that was<br>kind of where that sits and i think now<br>you see um<br>people using those terms a little bit<br>interchangeably<br>they're sort of talk that they've got<br>they've got data sovereignty sitting<br>there but they're already talking about<br>indigenous data sovereignty maori data<br>sovereignty and they are a little bit<br>different<br>i think it's interesting because i<br>hadn't even considered i guess i sort of<br>talked about it briefly in my phd around<br>that distinction between data<br>sovereignty and indigenous data<br>sovereignty and maori data sovereignty<br>um<br>and then i went about using them<br>interchangeably without even thinking<br>about i guess the languaging of it um<br>and it wasn't until you asked us<br>yesterday and it kind of when i wrote<br>about it in my phd i kind of<br>had this internal joke where i was like<br>you know people are really worried about<br>you know data is seen as this way of<br>creating policy for the future or like<br>change be having this transformative<br>potential for the way that our lives are<br>shaped and so<br>it's really of concern to us if we don't<br>have the jurisdiction or authority over<br>those rights because they're in someone<br>else's land and i had this kind of<br>internal chuckle like<br>wow is this really like a new concept<br>that you would be concerned about<br>someone else controlling you that you<br>just didn't give authority to and like<br>maybe this is the perfect place for<br>maori to have like uh<br>or indigenous peoples to have you know<br>take a lead in the conversation because<br>it seems to me that we've got like a<br>pretty sort of strong history of<br>challenging that idea that there's this<br>sort of external authority that can<br>control<br>you without your kind of<br>consent um beforehand<br>um<br>and the conditions under which we sort<br>of hand over sovereignty to to another<br>kind of distinct nation but yeah no i<br>think um<br>yeah so thank you for raising that as a<br>i'll make sure that i refer to maori<br>data sovereignty specifically<br>i mean the other thing too and i think<br>it sort of relates to what you're<br>talking about and also that the<br>stewardship is it you see people um sort<br>of thinking about as an idea and trying<br>to relate it to other things and so part<br>of it comes into this idea of<br>stewardship and that's actually what<br>people are meaning or sometimes they<br>think about it as privacy so when we're<br>dealing with data privacies and people<br>think about consent it's your ability to<br>control it yourself<br>yeah and so i think you know that sort<br>of personal control<br>versus what might be a community control<br>yeah versus a sort of a nation-state<br>kind yeah that's what i've added to it<br>that i've always thought of it like<br>another kind of definition there of data<br>sovereignty is the rights for groups to<br>be able to control their own story and<br>stories about them as well like when<br>we've talked about like i've been part<br>of<br>the manalanghi project which is like a<br>pacific lgbt health needs survey and<br>that's where we've kind of<br>conceptualized that as it's like the<br>right for that community to be able to<br>hold their own data about themselves and<br>then tell their own story based on that<br>and i think that's where like yeah the<br>data sovereignty terminology has<br>actually kind of shifted and maybe<br>it's<br>that's interesting i mean you're sort of<br>touching on going also from uh<br>individual data rights to collect to<br>data rights as part of<br>one thing that you mentioned maui is you<br>you've been around as these terms were<br>created you're<br>right in the middle of the formation of<br>it's only five years<br>are you sure it's fine it's not a<br>generation<br>um<br>maybe if you wouldn't mind sort of<br>setting the scene a little bit around<br>maori data sovereignty and its<br>foundations what was sort of being<br>responded to maybe what is maori data<br>sovereignty<br>okay so uh<br>i think you know the<br>basic<br>definition is you know just mighty<br>control of mighty data<br>that's sort of what the intent is and<br>whether that's the definition or the<br>intended you know sort of means the same<br>thing<br>and i think it came about you know it's<br>the foundations of it you know are<br>pretty deep there's you know all sorts<br>of um<br>i guess<br>uh discussions around maori research<br>co-papi research how people become more<br>in control of the processes of knowledge<br>production<br>and you know that's got you know<br>20 30 years of scholarship and a lot of<br>it was based out of here at you know<br>auckland university with linda smith and<br>graham smith and others<br>and then as i think the context of<br>knowledge production has changed and you<br>know we took about 50 years being the<br>period of time when um sort of computer<br>science and people getting computer<br>science degrees was here<br>and the sorts of things that have been<br>possible even changed even over the last<br>20 or 25 years and so that shift of<br>material out of that space the<br>conversations that were taking place<br>around research ethics and what was<br>appropriate in terms of research and<br>that was a little bit more of my<br>background<br>we were thinking<br>really thinking about how data was being<br>stored what you know how long was there<br>for what were appropriate uses secondary<br>use in a research context which is<br>pretty confined and tight but you could<br>see what was happening generally out in<br>the world either in commercial spaces or<br>even<br>you know across government with<br>administrative data how it was<br>becoming<br>much more accessible<br>much easier to collect<br>much easier to aggregate and much easier<br>to share<br>and there were all of these pressures<br>that were pushing it down that sort of<br>track<br>so<br>i think we were able to<br>in some ways<br>ride on the back of some public concerns<br>there was a lot of discussion around<br>social social license to operate<br>you know what sorts of<br>what sorts of data that was being<br>collected about us as individuals which<br>the government was collecting should<br>they be able to share with others<br>and as people were starting to think<br>about that we're going well actually<br>where does you know where do maori<br>sitting that where do we sit in that<br>picture and what sort of<br>discussion should we be having around it<br>and i think that was kind of the<br>intersect that<br>led to you know the discussions about<br>indigenous data sovereignty<br>what it might mean and allowed us to<br>become a part of<br>some of the conversations<br>and and that's that's part of what its<br>point was is the give us<br>a place to have a say about these<br>changes that were taking place in the<br>world<br>much of it driven by you know computing<br>and cloud<br>cloud services but you guys were also<br>part of the global indigenous data<br>alliance as well so it's like that's<br>that thing that we always have to<br>reinforce that it's not like just uh so<br>yeah<br>and you know the<br>the actual group that helped put<br>together the initial um<br>uh i guess sort of the sort of initial<br>thoughts around that was an<br>international one<br>there were people from us and canada and<br>australia that were all a part of the<br>the meeting there was the first meeting<br>that led to the book indigenous data<br>sovereignty towards agenda<br>and that was sort of like the<br>foundation of all of the work and<br>then<br>different data sovereignty networks<br>started in some of those countries<br>and between those and then the global<br>indigenous data alliance have<br>done a lot of the international advocacy<br>around<br>indigenous data sovereignty and then<br>maori data sovereignty locally<br>and then probably the other thing that<br>gave it some momentum here in new<br>zealand was<br>when the<br>ewe leaders group so the eb cheers forum<br>who were already<br>getting together to engage with the<br>crown around policy in different spaces<br>sort of recognized that data was one of<br>those<br>underpinning foundations for all of<br>their different work areas whether it<br>was environmental health or economics<br>and once they put a particular focus on<br>on that area and then all of a sudden<br>you had a political support you know<br>maori political support sitting behind<br>it<br>um it's you know gained gained more and<br>is that short enough<br>there are a bunch of things i'd be keen<br>to kind of explore a little bit but um<br>maybe we should narrow it down but<br>head back towards cloud<br>all right so<br>given that our theme is cloud computing<br>we're seeing<br>plans sprung into action for<br>large data centers based here or<br>locally owned catalyst cloud recently<br>granted<br>agreed<br>some sort of all of government framework<br>with the dia<br>for services<br>and this might be taken by some<br>commentators to kind of solve<br>i thought your name was next to this<br>question<br>i needed some space for you though well<br>i guess like i i just kind of like<br>wanted to sort of just discuss some of<br>the issues that i've been having and<br>like because i'm not like in the<br>computer science space so much as the<br>sort of like<br>just that sort of figuring out like like<br>one of the reasons that i came into this<br>whole space was trying to figure out how<br>to actually the new zealand election<br>study and we have<br>like this time around about 1300 maori<br>who have participated and it became a<br>case of for us of like figuring out what<br>to do with that data because there<br>wasn't anywhere where we could point to<br>that we could say that hey this is a<br>really like safe good place that's<br>onshore to store maori data and that was<br>where like i kind of like started<br>reading and thinking about these issues<br>because to me it's like when i'm going<br>to do anything like today a friend of<br>ours is collecting maori saliva at the<br>moment and<br>today i like literally did this study<br>for her and it was like well my<br>data there has to be sent to sydney to<br>analyze and then it's like one of those<br>things where it will be stored like all<br>of these issues are actually quite<br>important<br>for us and like for maori and just for a<br>lot of like marginalized groups because<br>it becomes a case of<br>you've been screwed over a lot of times<br>and when the control then<br>drifts away in the case of the saliva i<br>trust the people involved um but it's<br>like one of those things of there is a<br>history in the last 30 years of<br>university researchers like running away<br>to australia with genetic samples and<br>all that sort of stuff so i think that<br>that's one of the things to note that<br>like when we're coming to these<br>conversations<br>that it's like you kind of need to be<br>able to explain like<br>where the data is going to go like where<br>it actually will be<br>that there isn't going to be that<br>slippery slope type thing or that<br>conceptual drift of the data are<br>collected this is what it's consented<br>for and then like 20 years later<br>actually we're using it for this all<br>funky genetic tests that this person<br>back here could never consent for<br>and that there will be some kind of and<br>like it's almost like a cliche at the<br>moment to say kaitiakitanga but there<br>will be some kind of kaitiakitanga or<br>stewardship or maori data governance<br>process<br>that will mean that that data like it's<br>protected from going all the way over<br>here firstly and it's protected in some<br>way that there will be some kind of<br>consent process so i mean that's the<br>kind of stuff that we've been struggling<br>for in our project just figuring out<br>where exactly we can have all these<br>things at play<br>and store data safely so it's not a case<br>like you don't want to personally<br>especially as a maori researcher like<br>put your name on a consent form send out<br>the study do the research and then have<br>your open access data<br>used in a way that deficit frames or<br>diminishes the mana of the participants<br>so like you don't want to do that<br>ethically and you also don't want to do<br>that for your reputation<br>um but yeah just generally those have<br>been the issues that i've been working<br>through<br>yeah i don't know<br>i think um it's really interesting<br>because<br>you know you're asking about whether or<br>not having sort of data centers here<br>would solve the issue and all of a<br>sudden kind of data sovereignty would be<br>swedes<br>and it's kind of there's a tendency in<br>any kind of technolo technology talk<br>that technology's great that actually<br>it's the future and that it has all this<br>amazing but it's really future focused<br>and i think lara what you've picked up<br>on there and what's being sort of<br>discussed at the beginning of this talk<br>is actually that we get to this point<br>with a history attached and that any<br>kind of<br>reluctance resistance or fear<br>experienced by maori<br>does have a history<br>and it is embedded in like<br>poor research practices and poor uses of<br>data and the exploitation of like maori<br>bodies and indigenous bodies and<br>research and i think that's something<br>that's really important and maori data<br>sovereignty has the capacity to kind of<br>deal with and theorize around how we<br>move forward and just recognizing the<br>need that actually like you can have a<br>data center here that stores data but if<br>you don't have<br>the<br>um<br>or the governance frameworks which allow<br>for like the renegotiation of consent<br>for example with um data<br>then you're still not solving the<br>problem because<br>like remember that the definition of<br>maori data sovereignty is separate from<br>the jurisdictional authority attached to<br>where data is located so having a data<br>center here goes some way in kind of<br>offering us some security<br>but it certainly doesn't offer<br>kind of all of the protections that we<br>would<br>hope for<br>if that makes sense totally<br>a number of maori were very concerned<br>that the photograph was stealing that<br>manner<br>so does<br>that<br>concept<br>apply to data or is that what you're<br>telling us<br>i think it's a really interesting idea<br>and i think there's there's sort of<br>elements of that um it was interesting<br>that lara brought up you know sort of<br>these ideas around when people were<br>taking taking samples as well so you<br>know you weren't saying initially then<br>it was the photograph of people saw they<br>were losing something with that and you<br>could get a little bit later on and<br>people taking samples whether it's blood<br>or saliva<br>and having more concerns about that when<br>it's being shipped offshore it's in the<br>ethics process often talking about that<br>so when we put together some guidelines<br>around genomic research and biobanking<br>and had some principles in there and one<br>was<br>ketote wairua tetangata which was like<br>that the<br>person's sort of the person's spirit but<br>just that they felt comfort it was a<br>level of comfort so people felt<br>comfortable about what was going on<br>and usually when you're uncertain about<br>what's happening with things you start<br>to get a little bit worried and it's<br>often<br>not at the time where it happens it's a<br>bit later on<br>so it's later on when um<br>you see the news articles about<br>something bad happening somewhere else<br>with someone's data and you go oh i<br>wonder what happened to this over here<br>and so you know how what are the sorts<br>of things that can be in place that make<br>you feel comfortable with these things<br>that are happening and that's that sort<br>of trust element<br>um that that builds up or you know as<br>kitty said there's lots of places where<br>there's that trust isn't there<br>and we had um kippumo te mano te tangata<br>which was really about a level of<br>control<br>so how do you maintain levels of control<br>in the way in which<br>you know this this was<br>uh in relation to genetics but you could<br>also think about it in data so<br>control what can happen with things at<br>different times<br>and then to kaupapa which was<br>really just the integrity of the system<br>and so if you know that their system has<br>a lot of accountabilities in place you<br>become happier about things shifting<br>into it<br>and so i think that's sort of part of<br>the picture and then the other picture<br>always is you know<br>pull out my phone and i'll be doing all<br>sorts of stuff and sharing all sorts of<br>data i won't even give it a second<br>thought<br>because there's some value which i think<br>i'm getting out of it so it's always a<br>little bit of a an exchange and a<br>balance between<br>um<br>the value which someone's getting<br>and then<br>what they might be you know what they<br>might be what they might giving up<br>and i think what<br>the communities have felt and actually i<br>think a lot of the general public have<br>felt<br>is that there's<br>not enough<br>kind of controls<br>generally<br>that mean that the benefit of all of<br>this activity on the cloud has been<br>being sort of fed surely<br>it's you know it's really accruing to<br>these multilateral companies<br>they do their best not to pay taxes you<br>know there's a whole kind of series of<br>things which make people feel like the<br>system is geared against us a bit and so<br>therefore we want to try and control<br>things a little bit more<br>and that's<br>certainly something that feeds into<br>what a lot of e we feel<br>um in terms of you know their<br>relationship and how they're trying to<br>assert more control over data that that<br>is relevant to them<br>i was at an international meeting<br>where it was agreed that<br>i changed the encoding to allow the<br>macro<br>and that was<br>a huge leadership issue<br>because it was highly supported by<br>japanese for double because it opened<br>the way for<br>other scripts<br>are being included in the internet<br>so that was<br>leadership yeah<br>and you know i think that's<br>a really good example too of<br>um<br>the sorts of things which people would<br>like to see coming out of this<br>discussion a discussion around maori<br>data sovereignty which leads them to<br>become a part of a discussion<br>about<br>you know what does the future look like<br>particularly in a sort of a digital<br>space digital environment<br>and can it reflect macrons can it<br>reflect different scripts can it reflect<br>different world views<br>can we make<br>as the real one i was actually having<br>this um i was having this<br>as i was thinking in the car driving up<br>the motorway<br>when you<br>think you're going to do your best<br>thinking<br>so like you know what what do we want<br>out of a digital environment<br>and you know there's you know there's<br>the metaverse out there and so often you<br>know people are going there to run away<br>from their life<br>because there's something kind of more<br>interesting about what might sit there<br>but they're also wanting to go there to<br>reinforce aspects of their life and<br>particularly<br>in a lot of indigenous communities being<br>displaced from their places<br>and how does that<br>how can they go into that digital<br>environment<br>and find themselves there as well not<br>running away from but running back to<br>you know this interesting<br>idea<br>um<br>i i wonder<br>why<br>the cloud building trend has become the<br>trigger for this<br>because there's a lot of data collection<br>going on<br>for decades really so every lab test<br>every prescription expression every<br>contact with gp or other providers some<br>data associated with that is going into<br>government coffers did i say updated<br>and that's been happening for decades<br>before<br>the topic so i just wonder what's your<br>but that seems to me that that core<br>issue<br>of i think the user-change stewardship<br>of that data is really the issue so<br>if we're<br>focused on that<br>can we then kind of make the technology<br>almost irrelevant<br>i would say for me one of the things<br>that got me involved in this space has<br>been data collection in terms of<br>government um i don't know like to some<br>extent<br>it's it's that history of maori with<br>government like i guess there's also a<br>history of maori with corporations but<br>in terms of government and the idi and<br>consent for that that's where a lot of<br>my work sits so i don't necessarily know<br>if that's been if cloud computing is<br>such as being a trigger i think it's<br>more<br>maybe this overall related to this<br>overall<br>consciousness of or conscience raising<br>of like thinking about your data and<br>where your data is going as individuals<br>and then maori also as collectives<br>thinking about that especially given<br>histories<br>you know what you are i think um<br>like we've already talked about how a<br>lot of the like central tenants of maori<br>data sovereignty sort of come from land<br>rights movement so i think we've been<br>talking about these issues for a lot for<br>a long time and actually<br>the whole data collection issue that you<br>sort of mentioned<br>and your question is something that was<br>the subject of like criticism when we<br>talked about research ethics and how<br>research um you know linda smith said<br>research is a dirty word for indigenous<br>people and that's about data collection<br>and that was always about the way that<br>data was used against<br>maori and indigenous peoples generally<br>and around how like deficit framing is<br>something you're right that has been<br>happening um but i think what's<br>different about the technologies that<br>are available now is their capacity for<br>speed<br>and<br>like growing at exponential rates so<br>it's about scaling up our<br>our theorizing around maori data<br>sovereignty so these are not new<br>arguments we're not introducing anything<br>radically different from what we've been<br>talking about<br>since you know you mentioned 1830s in<br>the taking of photos we're still talking<br>about the same things and the assertion<br>of those same rights it's just this is<br>the sort of new frontier of um<br>anti-colonialism or you know i guess<br>in that way the strength of our<br>theorizing will maintain and persist<br>beyond whatever technology or<br>technological<br>technological development might come<br>sort of in the future i don't know if<br>that kind of answers<br>the question and so if we if we actually<br>tried to answer the question that daniel<br>gave at the beginning<br>i don't know how that was that was like<br>what a good panelist<br>is<br>i think it was i think it was sort of<br>reinforced you know<br>as a stewardship the central issue<br>because you know like you said it's been<br>happening for a long time i think the<br>trigger for<br>people's concern about the data<br>collection wasn't the collection of the<br>data it was the use of the data and more<br>particularly the reuse of the data<br>outside the context which it was being<br>collected and so the sort of data<br>linkage and data sharing which has been<br>a more sort of recent<br>kind of possibility you know this is all<br>because of technology<br>um<br>and people started seeing that moving<br>around and exactly you know what um<br>kitty was saying the scale of it and the<br>speed of it that's what got them<br>concerned<br>and so then<br>going back to data stewardship being<br>this this issue<br>is connected to what um you know we're<br>getting these um<br>cloud servers based in new zealand now<br>that's going to deal with these issues<br>around sovereignty well it only deals<br>with the place where the data is held<br>it doesn't<br>necessarily give you more control over<br>the data so if that's what we're aiming<br>for you know there's issues like<br>data security is going to be important<br>because it's no good at being based here<br>if it can get stolen everyone else can<br>get it you know you've lost control<br>right there<br>so you've got a control issue with that<br>you've got a control issue with<br>governance because the governance part<br>is actually about the approved use so<br>what are you allowed to use that data<br>for now that's a whole another different<br>sort of question and then that sort of<br>drops down into then<br>if you're going to use it in the same<br>way the idi you know collects the data<br>and makes it available what sorts of<br>ethics and frameworks do they use to<br>make decisions around that and you start<br>talking about that<br>so the<br>kind of legislative data sovereignty<br>component<br>is like a really small bit<br>because there's probably a few you know<br>very few places where you'd be really<br>truly concerned about that element<br>um<br>won't name any countries but there's<br>probably some definitely some countries<br>you won't go to or you wouldn't put your<br>data because you don't trust that it<br>would be safe there<br>we won't that<br>the government won't put certain sorts<br>of data in those spaces because it's<br>they feel like it's too sensitive but<br>then there's other sorts which they say<br>well you know on balance<br>security things all these other things<br>are fine so<br>do you question that an exclusionary<br>kind of rights friendly is sufficient to<br>achieve that<br>so essentially like copyright privacy<br>etc<br>and<br>if not if that's not sufficient what<br>yeah what i'd say is that whenever you<br>put a set of rules up and academics are<br>kind of good at doing this as well but<br>governments can be good at doing this<br>whenever you put a set of rules up we'll<br>figure out ways that people figure out<br>ways around them and so it's making sure<br>that whatever<br>thing that you put up there's some kind<br>of process for maori data sovereignty<br>within any rules because at least then<br>we get some kind of like something<br>because then they're some kind of<br>protection but i think that's where we<br>have to be really careful about<br>legislating the things um i recently<br>wrote a couple of submissions on the<br>data and statistics bill and there's<br>actually a bit of bit of just like a bit<br>of drama going on there around privacy<br>and rights at the moment but um and<br>actually really it's actually really<br>concerning so i won't like flippantly<br>say drama but it is that thing of<br>yeah like rules ultimately people will<br>find their ways around them like that's<br>i guess that that's where i'm concerned<br>about things and that like trying to<br>legislate for process is incredibly<br>tricky<br>but<br>i guess at least try<br>yeah<br>um yeah i would say that kind of if i<br>was to think specifically about<br>copyright laws or privacy laws it's<br>important to remember that anything that<br>sort of any law that's created<br>differentially impacts different<br>communities so we know that privacy is<br>something that tends to protect<br>individuals um it doesn't protect<br>collectives and what might be perfectly<br>safe for you as an individual<br>is sometimes incredibly unsafe<br>at a collective level um and that was<br>kind of expressed really early on with<br>the idi and the social license to<br>operate work that<br>sort of came out in that early<br>um<br>sort of when was it yeah the idi is the<br>easiest one to pick on because there<br>wasn't a democratic process and there<br>certainly wasn't one where maori were<br>properly consulted yeah and i just i<br>think<br>copyright law we've already sort of<br>talked at length um sort of in not in<br>this panel but<br>um around how intellectual property law<br>doesn't do a lot to support or protect<br>sort of indigenous rights to artifacts<br>or to knowledge or<br>um so<br>i don't have a lot of optimism around<br>kind of um the types of legislative<br>levers that you're referring to around<br>how they might protect<br>maori data but they could go<br>part of the question that you've<br>answered which is that<br>instruments for affecting exclusionary<br>rights are certainly not sufficient but<br>are you at a fundamental level saying<br>that<br>body control over maori data is<br>equivalent to<br>preventing<br>non-maori use of maori data which is<br>underlying basis of exclusive rights and<br>copyright privacy with all of those<br>examples of exclusionary rights<br>so<br>my answer is my favorite one yes no<br>maybe<br>and<br>so so i think there's<br>at the moment the discussion around<br>mardi gras sovereignty has been very um<br>what would i say uh<br>rights focused and quite political<br>and it's now moving into the space where<br>it has to become more<br>action orientated and sort of functional<br>and i think you know getting towards<br>what are the what are the things that<br>can be put in place that start to enable<br>or move towards a place where might have<br>more control of my data<br>is actually the really interesting but<br>kind of challenging work that lies in<br>there's<br>you know i think<br>one of the things one of the things<br>around it is that you can take sort of<br>like something that belongs to a person<br>it's a part they're a part of a family<br>so it's family information they're a<br>part of the ewe so it's ebay information<br>they're a part of maori so it's maori<br>information they're a part of the nation<br>so it's nation information and i think<br>where we probably end up having to get<br>to is just<br>um not so much um<br>uh sort of a rights-based exclusionary<br>property type thing and it very quickly<br>moves into that conversation but one's<br>around<br>what sort of use rights do different<br>groups have<br>and what sorts of things are they<br>allowed to do and what sorts of things<br>are they allowed and you know<br>exclusionary is really about stopping<br>other people from doing things<br>and so i think<br>becoming nuanced about what that looks<br>like will be really interesting and you<br>know<br>i think the practical example of that<br>recently was<br>around<br>the whanau order group wanting to get<br>access to the covert data well the<br>personal details actually associated<br>with the cover data for<br>um<br>as a sort of a maori provider<br>and the sorts of differences the you<br>know<br>the ministry of health had a difference<br>of opinion around that<br>we had different ideas around that<br>and so<br>as we move into the environment of the<br>maori health authority as well they're<br>going to have to kind of work out what<br>those sort of relative<br>i was wondering um<br>what overlay do you see between maori<br>data sovereignty and then to truthy<br>i would say like what one of the things<br>like being a political scientist and<br>then coming into the data center space<br>is that real like<br>just like i i've seen a lot of sort of<br>discussion around like you know when it<br>comes to something like<br>any kind of<br>maori and bringing back to maori land<br>like pootiky bay for example where<br>it was clear that in the process a<br>certain trust group was consulted<br>instead of a different one and all that<br>kind of stuff where i see the<br>similarities is it's like okay making<br>sure you<br>there is some kind of maori control and<br>some kind of maori like consultation but<br>also within that it's not just a like<br>tokenistic hey what do you think we're<br>going to ignore it and i see that that<br>meeting policy really well because i<br>think that<br>when it comes to anything relating to<br>something that maori have rights and<br>interests in it's important to actually<br>like start a conversation early like<br>actually listen like actually do some<br>things and actually and that like that's<br>where i see a lot of this data software<br>stuff overlapping with politics and<br>policy a lot like just in the in the<br>work that i do<br>um that's where i would see<br>a lot of that like the you know the<br>treaty and tita dt in practice would be<br>within that yeah<br>i think te mana ranga also talks about<br>the fact that all data has the capacity<br>to be tanga so you you wouldn't say that<br>all data<br>but all data have<br>the ability to be framed or understood<br>as tanga and so from that perspective<br>then<br>um because data<br>and tang are protected under undertale<br>there's a very clear connection<br>it's also a useful connection to make<br>because it empowers the government to<br>take action in terms of their<br>responsibility and accountability to<br>protect maori data because this isn't<br>just an issue maori are not solely<br>responsible for leading oh we're<br>responsible for leading the discussion<br>absolutely but we're not responsible for<br>coming up with all the solutions<br>actually this is something that involves<br>um<br>some kind of consensus and some kind of<br>um<br>yes consensus is the word i'm looking<br>for where we're sort of coming together<br>and recognizing that we all have a<br>responsibility<br>for solution making moving forward and<br>that's really what<br>was grounded in was like around that<br>responsibility that mutual<br>responsibility mutual respect in terms<br>of like decision making for the future<br>did you just make some new principles i<br>and it does sort of connect with another<br>question around<br>four organizations that are moving<br>toward being tertility-led things around<br>engagement<br>what practical steps do you think ought<br>i'm just like like the second thing and<br>this is this is what's been really<br>tricky i think being an early career<br>maori academic in the university<br>like just stop getting a master's<br>student or like an honest student and<br>putting them 0.1 on a grant point on a<br>grant like paying them a certain amount<br>of hours and expecting them to speak on<br>behalf of all maori like the number of<br>times i've seen that in the last three<br>or four years is actually incredibly<br>disheartening um so that's like my main<br>rant because like what's happening<br>increasingly is like we're all out there<br>trying to build maori capacity and<br>capability constantly<br>and i spend a good chunk of my time<br>defending the talented maori undergrads<br>from having to be put into a position oh<br>money they need the money all the<br>universities paying me oh i'm a<br>university of auckland research<br>assistant when like that's something<br>that they would never have expected that<br>they would be in that position and then<br>yeah they're suddenly in this unsafe<br>space speaking on behalf of all maori<br>they don't get to learn their science or<br>their craft in the way and this is where<br>i've been really fortunate coming<br>through with this complexion because<br>people don't turn to me and go<br>so what do all the maori think you know<br>like i haven't had that experience um so<br>that's<br>yeah and i've seen it happen like at<br>least probably 20 times in three years<br>and so that's the first like do not do<br>step i would say and all of that because<br>yeah like we need for stewardship for<br>co-governance structures and all of<br>those good things we need to be able to<br>bring the next generation through and<br>it's just like there are a lot of<br>barriers at the moment so that's my rant<br>yeah i mean i've been one of those<br>students that gets pulled into a<br>research project that i know absolutely<br>nothing about<br>um<br>as a maori voice and it's really hard<br>because there is a huge responsibility<br>placed on your shoulders to be<br>representative of all maori but i think<br>you know like the<br>i guess the title of the talk<br>the idea of like<br>walking backwards into the future what<br>we don't want is a repetition of like<br>what we saw in ethics which is does your<br>research project have any kind of<br>tertiary considerations or and so we go<br>and see sort of a maori<br>academic who can tick off your project<br>as having consultation or in the vision<br>section because the government's really<br>interested in giving out money to people<br>who are cognizant or aware of kind of<br>treaty issues i will go and talk to a<br>maori so that's not that's what we don't<br>want with maori day yeah yeah yeah this<br>is a concept or this<br>a framework which<br>overworks and overloads our<br>maori students but also our maori staff<br>with questions that don't allow us to be<br>like we're constantly in response mode<br>we want to be like future proofing data<br>sovereignty and i think<br>that the really important thing is that<br>like<br>if you're really interested in doing<br>maori data sovereignty then you're gonna<br>have to<br>do some reading and get educated and not<br>the reading<br>is going to be able to<br>always be there to answer your questions<br>and like be open to learning and<br>actually<br>possibly like a practical step might be<br>really like relinquishing some of your<br>control and power and be ready to do<br>that because that's probably one of the<br>biggest things that's a barrier at the<br>moment is people not wanting to kind of<br>let go of the power that they hold over<br>data<br>what do i think<br>wow you keep pointing out the i'm going<br>to go<br>to me<br>so i think there's like there's there's<br>two things that i've been highlighted<br>here one is the need for building maori<br>capacity and then what does it mean to<br>be a good ally in this work and you know<br>there's sort of activities i think<br>there's a whole range of activities<br>you'd like to see i mean auckland i<br>think they've got a<br>maori data sovereignty role<br>you know those things are starting to<br>emerge i think you've got<br>things that are happening around<br>bringing forward maternal and maori and<br>i think as mata and maori becomes more a<br>part of decision making and research in<br>a whole variety of places<br>you highlight these issues around well<br>who's looking after that what does that<br>mean and so that kind of brings mighty<br>data sovereignty ideas to the fore<br>the<br>um i think the<br>there's uh there's work that's going on<br>at the moment with the eb chairs um<br>thinking about you know what maori<br>governance frameworks look like and i<br>think that's going to start to highlight<br>expectations around<br>whether it's co-governance or maori data<br>governance in the context of data<br>infrastructures<br>and what sorts of approaches can be used<br>at that space but i think the whole area<br>around<br>how you actually build all of this stuff<br>to make it work and<br>operationalise things so you know i<br>think we're talking about uh i don't<br>know if anyone was talking about it but<br>part of the part of the data sovereignty<br>you know part of concern when people<br>started talking about data sovereignty<br>and cloud computing was vulcanization<br>and everyone going off and doing the<br>same thing and so we've got this bit<br>we're also talking about<br>interoperability and making sure things<br>can talk to each other and work across<br>and in a lot of places that pushes<br>towards centralization and central<br>platforms um<br>i think there's a shift in conversation<br>towards thinking can you can they be<br>more federalized platforms so that they<br>can still operate and work with each<br>other but have a degree of control that<br>sits with the nodes<br>and i know universities are talking<br>about that certainly e we would like to<br>be in a position where that happens but<br>for that to happen<br>we need people to build those sorts of<br>systems<br>those sorts of systems that will enable<br>that sort of control to exist in it or<br>within<br>the things that are set up different<br>ways that governance can inform<br>the<br>that controls the access controls that<br>are provided sort of up and down those<br>places so<br>i remember when um<br>started talking there's a guy at waikato<br>uni ryan co i don't know anyone knows me<br>as sort of cyber security guy<br>i came down from singapore anyways he's<br>going oh you know i don't really get the<br>smarty data sorry thing you know you're<br>talking about rights he goes<br>like computer guys don't care about<br>rights they care about standards and<br>money<br>you know and if you think about the way<br>stuff uh the way<br>that system systems end up getting built<br>across you know multiple jurisdictions<br>it's around how do people decide what<br>the standards look like the people that<br>can do that tend to be the ones with the<br>money that have a you know a vested<br>interest in it so they kind of build it<br>along that lines and it enables them to<br>do it because they've got the money to<br>kind of create the next thing<br>so i really<br>have always remembered that so how do<br>you get involved with creating different<br>sorts of standards that allow you to put<br>the macron on things<br>that change the way in which<br>things can be constructed and<br>if you can help<br>you know realize those sorts of<br>aspirations<br>um<br>you know alongside you know certainly<br>alongside<br>uh maori groups to help them meet the<br>things that they're interested in<br>getting towards<br>uh that would be really good do you<br>think a lot of the control has already<br>been lost<br>we have a good friend<br>who has marine access<br>recently a goldy painting came up of her<br>ancestor<br>the family<br>wanted to take it back to the family<br>but the<br>auctioneering company<br>only gave them three days<br>and they didn't have the ability to<br>raise<br>several hundred thousand dollars in<br>three<br>days has now been sold to somebody and<br>the auctioneer doesn't believe they have<br>to tell<br>us<br>was<br>was it the nft one as well so they had<br>the one and they they sold the painting<br>and then they said actually you should i<br>wasn't a painting it was a photograph of<br>something and then they said you should<br>destroy that and just keep the<br>digital image<br>which is sort of a bit weird but<br>but i think there's um<br>this is a sort of history in this legacy<br>so there's a whole lot of legacy things<br>that happen<br>but you know one of the projects i'm<br>trying to put in place traditional<br>knowledge labels and biocultural labels<br>and really it's just a digital tag which<br>you can put in a record that starts to<br>re-insert<br>um<br>the cultural authority that sits there<br>so that what sits at the moment is like<br>the copyright and the people that have<br>ended up in that situation<br>and so if you can start to then sort of<br>name and make transparent the<br>relationships of that community to that<br>painting when it comes up there's a<br>different sort of conversation they can<br>get involved in so you know it's<br>different um<br>we can't un and this i mean we're in the<br>situation we're in<br>but there are ways that as those things<br>are being digitized that you create<br>space for a different voice to come<br>through<br>and i think that then allows that<br>different narrative<br>that lara was talking about right at the<br>beginning to become present and not just<br>to be silenced out and i think that's<br>one of<br>you know the big challenges as<br>everything starts to get pushed into the<br>in the<br>government database<br>we might have to continue i'm not sure<br>how we're going for time i think we've<br>just hit the half-past mark so that's<br>been some great questions uh and<br>thank you very much the panelists<br>um<br>i've got a a final whakatauki<br>te amorangi kimua te hapai or kimudi so<br>with our panelists and all of us up<br>front there's a whole heap of people<br>working behind the scenes to make this<br>happen<br>so those<br>crew at the back filming thank you very<br>much jill giovanni<br>those in the office we've got<br>jane d<br>um carmen<br>uh and everyone else was involved<br>sitting up here so thank you all very<br>much and<br>we'll see you
