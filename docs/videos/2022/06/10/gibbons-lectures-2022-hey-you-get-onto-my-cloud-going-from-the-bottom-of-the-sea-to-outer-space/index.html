researchers and local<br>chemologists um tsunami experts and<br>other interesting folks so his exciting<br>summary today has a title of hey you get<br>onto my cloud going from bottom to sea<br>to other space please join me in<br>welcoming<br>and um<br>i've been introduced so let's dive<br>straight in<br>so<br>what please is a cloud do you guys know<br>right blank faces i'm not surprised<br>that term cloud computing's been around<br>for probably about 10 15 years something<br>like that i'm not exactly sure when it<br>crept in and<br>to this very day i don't really know<br>fully what it means so quite why i got<br>invited today i'm not entirely sure<br>but um<br>so cheapest way to getting onto the<br>cloud is by one of these these boxes<br>they come from different manufacturers<br>and they're called personal clouds<br>and<br>is this are these really clouds<br>um yeah according to them there are but<br>basically it's just basically<br>marketing speak<br>it's not what i would call a cloud<br>so for the purposes of this talk um<br>a cloud is a distributed system of<br>computers offering processing<br>storage or data delivery capacity to<br>service providers on the one hand and<br>end users on the other<br>and this is important for this talk<br>because this is where it's called organa<br>revolve around that's being accessed via<br>the internet<br>so all those usb cable<br>devices that we've just seen on the<br>previous slides they don't count<br>okay so what i mean by processing<br>so you've probably heard about things<br>like amazon web server system with<br>anyone from amazon here today<br>no okay i understand there was somebody<br>meant to come but they could curb it or<br>something<br>don't know um so basically<br>what you do with amazon web services you<br>go out and<br>you hire yourself processing capacity so<br>basically you get a computer somewhere<br>on the cloud or something that looks<br>like a computer to you that you can log<br>in<br>and they give you scalable processing<br>capacity based on a certain number of<br>cpus that you request<br>and a certain amount of memory that you<br>require and then a certain amount of<br>storage<br>like hard drive capacity or nominal hard<br>drive capacity but in reality it's not a<br>physical computer it's distributed<br>typically over a number of machines<br>that sit in one or more data center<br>and<br>this is entirely transparent to you so<br>you can put your website there or you<br>know do your compute tasks or whatever<br>you want to do<br>so um also<br>um there's the concept of cloud storage<br>and you probably all use one of one of<br>these either google drive or dropbox or<br>microsoft onedrive or apple icloud all<br>of these<br>are basically cloud-based storage and as<br>you probably know if you happen to be on<br>a not so great internet connection<br>getting large files on and off that<br>cloud storage is a bit of an issue<br>right so again you need a good internet<br>connection to do this<br>so last but not least we're talking<br>about delivery capacity<br>so uh this is the ability of a cloud<br>service provider from<br>their their their their machines from<br>their networks to deliver large amounts<br>of data efficiently<br>to end users that you want to serve so<br>the typical application there<br>is web services<br>and websites<br>and the idea is that the cloud allows<br>you to bring these services very very<br>close topologically to your users so<br>that for example<br>say i'm a great fan of the bbc world<br>service so<br>when i look at the bbc world service<br>website and of course everybody knows<br>it's london calling so<br>they sit in london but in reality when i<br>look at their website it's being served<br>to me from a server here in auckland so<br>the files get to me really really<br>quickly and moreover they don't have to<br>travel all the way between london and<br>here every time somebody here looks at<br>it<br>so there that actually takes quite a bit<br>of load off the international network<br>so um cloud service providers uh<br>companies that a lot of people<br>haven't actually heard of so it's names<br>like fastly or cloud flair or akamai and<br>there's quite a few more and the ones<br>that i just mentioned earlier on are<br>amazon web servers and so they also all<br>provide mixed products that fall into<br>that bracket<br>and<br>yeah<br>so when one of these cloud service<br>providers fails<br>and you look at the media the first<br>thing that you hear is<br>the internet's broken down<br>right this is fake news the internet was<br>actually operational<br>uh from the 1st of january last year to<br>the 31st of this of december inclusive<br>it never broke down what broke down<br>on the 6th of june i think it was uh was<br>fastly one of those cloud service<br>delivery providers um there's these<br>content delivery networks<br>and um because there were so many<br>websites that were being served through<br>them um<br>basically um it was experienced by a lot<br>of people like almost every website or a<br>lot of websites that they looked at<br>didn't work so the internet was down<br>when in reality the internet worked<br>perfectly it was just fastly that had<br>problems<br>so<br>now what does this tell us it tells us a<br>couple of things well firstly we need<br>good internet in order to access stuff<br>like this and in order to also be able<br>to host those um<br>those cloud service providers locally in<br>a particular place so<br>let me just explain how new zealand gets<br>its internet at the moment and<br>basically 99 points<br>probably nine percent of internet<br>traffic in new zealand<br>comes via one of those uh fiber optic<br>cables currently there's four of them in<br>operation so um this is the oops sorry<br>go away<br>so<br>no no no no<br>yeah here we go so this is the southern<br>cross cable that goes up to hawaii and<br>then actually backtracks over to sydney<br>and then there's another branch that<br>goes up to hawaii and from uh sorry to<br>fiji and from fiji onto hawaii and then<br>from hawaii they're too bright there's a<br>cross connect between the two branches<br>that end up in hawaii and there's two<br>branches also that go off uh go off to<br>the us mainland and there's a connection<br>between the two connection points um of<br>the southern cross cable at the west<br>coast so it's a true figure of eight<br>which basically means you can cut any of<br>those cables and the system itself will<br>still work you just gotta drive it<br>backwards to a certain extent<br>so you can still get there<br>so um since the southern cross cable was<br>built in the 1990s it's been upgraded a<br>few times<br>upgrading a<br>submarine fiber optic cable is typically<br>done not by upgrading the cable itself<br>but by operating the terminal equipment<br>at the endpoints of the cable<br>so<br>they do over time as this this equipment<br>evolves um they do evolve over time to<br>be uh you know providing more and more<br>uh capacity<br>but uh even so there's competition<br>that's sprung up<br>um so the first cop come on i'm on the<br>wrong<br>button here again okay so the uh<br>competition that sprung up uh is the<br>first one sprung up was the hawaii key<br>cable and then there's also the tesla<br>global access cable so the hawaii key<br>cable runs as you might guess from the<br>name runs up to hawaii and it has a<br>branching point in the<br>tes middle of the testament c uh one<br>branch goes over to sydney other branch<br>goes over to manga phi heads<br>and the tasman global<br>access or surfer line for short<br>that ends up in ragland<br>and sydney as you can see is quite an<br>important point<br>of presence and then there's a few<br>domestic cables floating around here as<br>well but since we're in auckland we<br>don't usually use those so i'm just<br>going to skip those for the moment<br>so um<br>talking about cables what do these these<br>these cables look like so<br>as you can see there's actually a new<br>cable here that i haven't mentioned in<br>this one here this is the southern cross<br>next cable and this is meant to go live<br>at the end of june or first of the can't<br>remember the 30th of june the first of<br>july<br>it's already been laid and i'm very<br>privileged today to be able to show you<br>a piece of that so to give you a bit of<br>an idea<br>this thing is a piece of the southern<br>cross submarine southern cross next<br>submarine fiber optic cable it's 20<br>centimeters long weighs about 800 grams<br>so what this means in practice is that a<br>kilometer of that thing weighs about<br>four tons<br>um so it's not something you want to be<br>putting into your into the back of your<br>car apart from the fact that it wouldn't<br>fit there<br>so to give you a bit of an idea what<br>that looks like structure wise and<br>unfortunately we haven't been able to<br>get the camera working here but what<br>you're looking at is you're looking at<br>about a one millimeter channel in the in<br>the middle this is where the actual<br>fiber runs and this one's lost its fiber<br>and around that uh you'll notice that<br>there's a very very sort of fine<br>um strained a protective steel cable<br>that runs around it and around that<br>you'll find there's a there's a little<br>copper ring the copper ring powers the<br>repeaters along the way of the cable and<br>there's i think 200 or something like<br>something like that along the way<br>so they're basically putting high<br>voltage in at one end and every repeater<br>takes a few volts<br>um out of that high voltage in the end<br>they're grounded at the far end of the<br>cable<br>so around that you'll find a bit of<br>plastic<br>protection protection and insulation and<br>then you find a really really really<br>strong multi-wire steel cable around it<br>which is essentially soaked in what must<br>be bitumen or something like this and<br>then around that there's a layer<br>of fabric again sort of soaked inside to<br>some some sort of plastic<br>for protection corrosion protection and<br>the sort of thing and um<br>that is really required so when a cable<br>ship like this like the reliance here<br>lies the cable<br>the cable has to support its own weight<br>under until it touches the sea floor and<br>when you're looking at the pacific a lot<br>of the pacific has a seafloor depth<br>about of about 5000 meters<br>so<br>and given the fact that you're really<br>pulling the cable behind the ship to a<br>certain extent um you can be looking at<br>10 20 kilometers worth<br>of cable having to support its own<br>weight until it hits the sea floor so<br>you're looking at quite a few tons and<br>this is why you're needing you know<br>quite that much steel so what i'm going<br>to do is i'm just going to pass this<br>around so you can all have a look at it<br>please do return it to me<br>i want to show this to my students in<br>the second semester<br>okay<br>so<br>um<br>or if you'd like to have a look at a<br>complete cable the old southern cross<br>cable is in our computer science museum<br>quick plug if you haven't had a look at<br>this uh it's over in the computer<br>science building and then spreads over<br>several floors this is on ground floor<br>on the connecting corridor between the<br>right so<br>if you find yourself in hawaii you know<br>that's who's been to hawaii show our<br>hands<br>okay who's been to big island hawaii<br>okay now if you work in data<br>communications you can be excused for a<br>bit of hacker tourism um so there's this<br>samuel m spencer beach park<br>which is a fairly unremarkable beach<br>park on the on the on the western side<br>the the leeward side of big island and<br>this is where the cable the southern<br>cross cable from takapuna lands and it's<br>roughly lands where that arrow is it's<br>not likely you could see anything<br>they've buried this really really well<br>and i would not suggest that you take<br>your grandkids or kids or anyone there<br>to dig it out<br>of course remember high voltage<br>and i actually had to go to a museum<br>um that's on the other side of that park<br>and find the longest serving ranger<br>there to inquire of him as to where that<br>cable was actually light because all the<br>younger staff didn't know<br>and it runs from there up the hill to a<br>hawaii telecom cable landing station<br>which is a sort of you know big you know<br>industrial looking building<br>um and so yeah so<br>basically if you do data communications<br>you get to see nice places from time to<br>time<br>okay so getting back<br>to fastly and so on so basically if you<br>want<br>to benefit from their services<br>as an end user you really want to be<br>topologically near one of those points<br>of presence of course that's where they<br>keep their servers that's where your<br>websites that way that's where your<br>youtube videos and and and are not<br>necessarily youtube videos but that's<br>for your videos that's where your<br>content sits<br>and you want to have really good<br>connection between one of those points<br>and yourself<br>so and of course you want this thing to<br>be working too but let's assume it's<br>working<br>so and let's assume that what we want to<br>do is we want to have a look at a cat<br>video and of course cat videos are among<br>the most shared<br>um<br>videos<br>on the planet so we're going to work<br>with cat videos now<br>and so let's assume for a moment we're<br>sitting somewhere on a remote pacific<br>island<br>in a you know a nice resort and you know<br>we're having our pina colada having you<br>know been served to us and we're just<br>relaxing<br>um us academics by the way don't get to<br>do this we're too lowly paid for that<br>um but<br>for all practical purposes<br>some people do and then then they sit<br>there and they basically want to you<br>know go and<br>upload their video to the cloud and<br>questions how do they do this now<br>depending on where you sit you might be<br>lucky if you're in the cook islands if<br>you're in rajong or ichitaki you'll get<br>cable but if you're not on and in places<br>like this or you know some some islands<br>in fiji then basically<br>the only way<br>that you can get internet there is via<br>satellite and there's essentially two<br>types of satellite that your signal<br>might go across the first one are<br>geostationary satellites and this is<br>what a geostationary satellite sees<br>roughly<br>uh from thirty six thousand well was<br>thirty five thousand seven hundred<br>thirty six thousand i can't even<br>remember the high thirty thousands uh<br>kilometers above the surface of the<br>earth<br>in a so-called geostationary or<br>geo-orbit and sitting above the equator<br>and this is what a satellite sees when<br>it sits above the pacific so for all<br>practical purposes it sees a lot of<br>places that already have cable like<br>hawaii north america new zealand<br>australia and it sees very very few<br>specs with relatively few customers<br>and<br>as a result of that there aren't<br>actually all that many satellites of<br>that sort over the pacific<br>and the ones that they are are there<br>they charge<br>like wounded bulls when it comes to<br>service<br>so um when they have a have a contract<br>with a local isp<br>uh internet service provider then that's<br>usually uh a commercial secret but if<br>you're in the industry you know uh they<br>were typically looking upwards of 200 uh<br>us dollars per megabit per second<br>of capacity per month<br>and if you compare that to your home<br>internet connection you suddenly realize<br>um that this this is the equivalent of<br>paying around about five thousand<br>dollars u.s a month for a typical home<br>internet connection and um<br>so as a result of that<br>this is a bit this is a bit tough now a<br>few years ago about 2014 2015<br>uh new provider turned up o3b<br>and they're serving from medium earth<br>orbit now medium earth orbit um<br>has the advantages a little bit closer<br>to earth<br>so we can actually reuse the frequency<br>spectrum a bit better around there we<br>also don't have such a long path so the<br>satellite doesn't have to transmit with<br>quite that much power<br>in order to get there so all great<br>things<br>and<br>at the ground side it's<br>beneficial because it means we can get<br>away with much much smaller antennas<br>we'll see that in a moment<br>but the antennas need to track<br>and you can't just send one satellite up<br>there because<br>geostationary orbit means geostationary<br>so it's literally sitting above one spot<br>on the equator<br>continuously whereas if you're in medium<br>earth orbit you're actually moving along<br>the equator and so this means that<br>watching from the ground those medium<br>earth orbit satellites they arise<br>and then they eventually set so you need<br>more than one satellite um they started<br>off with four i think they know about up<br>to about 16 or 20.<br>um but basically you need to track those<br>satellites and for that you need a<br>minimum of two antennas on the ground<br>so this is what the sort of setup looks<br>like on a place like italki<br>so<br>this was in 2015 so their old system was<br>an 8 megabit per second<br>geostationary satellite<br>using this big fixed here<br>and the new system that they just<br>commissioned was an o3b<br>system that depending on whether you<br>were tracking one or two satellites<br>would give you up to 40 or 80 megabits<br>from those antennas you can see all the<br>mechanics behind those antennas and<br>that's what's actually required to track<br>those satellites and as you can see it's<br>also pretty close to roid level and when<br>we were doing measurements there we were<br>noticing that they had this index these<br>inexplicable second long outages during<br>the middle of the night<br>and we figured out later on that um this<br>road around here is actually the road to<br>the local hospital and this was the<br>ambulance going out in the middle of the<br>night driving along the road high-sided<br>metal vehicle was interrupting the<br>signal path so um yeah but uh<br>anyway what does this all mean now<br>itotaki has a population of depending on<br>who you talk to and whether you include<br>tourists or not of a couple of thousand<br>and<br>um so<br>it's sort of a bit of a constant well<br>not necessary constants growing<br>but at the moment uh your typical<br>internet user<br>on this planet and this is a matter of<br>how you really define suppose but it's a<br>good rule of thumb your typical internet<br>user takes about one megabit per second<br>worth of uh capacity 24 7 hours a day uh<br>24 7<br>and 365 days a year<br>and so this means if you've got a<br>thousand uh 700 um<br>people on an island then you'd really<br>want to have a bandwidth of around about<br>um<br>1.7 gigabits available for all of them<br>for adequate service<br>however<br>you can see that with eight megabits per<br>second<br>or you know up to two times 40 megabits<br>per second we're really badly under<br>supplying here<br>but um again anything else anything more<br>than that is price-wise quite<br>prohibitive<br>so<br>wrong<br>okay<br>so<br>um right so the other thing is once you<br>have a satellite link and you're on isp<br>and you're<br>distributing this to a large number of<br>users you run into another problem<br>and that other problem<br>is that the internet's<br>most<br>common transport protocol or still most<br>common transport protocol tcp<br>doesn't really like going through those<br>long delay bottlenecks that are<br>satellite links<br>and when you do this with a large number<br>of users you get an effect called tcpq<br>oscillation<br>and what this means in practice is that<br>when those users are simultaneously<br>active your good put goes down and<br>the number of<br>packets lost at the input queue to the<br>satellite goes up<br>and or in produce the satellite link not<br>to the satellite itself and we can see<br>this here in a multi-day experiment that<br>we ran in 2015. so basically<br>this rate curve shows our good put and<br>in the middle of the night when nobody's<br>active sort of till the morning hours<br>we're getting pretty good good put on<br>our experiments and then during the day<br>it gets really depressed<br>and depressing for that matter and um<br>you know while the good put goes down<br>our packet loss goes up and i should say<br>with the packet loss here this is on a<br>logarithmic scale so we're talking about<br>this going up orders of magnitude<br>so<br>um<br>so we've been working a bit on on on<br>trying to address that with the network<br>coding that yon singh was uh referring<br>to i'm not going to talk much about that<br>today though because um<br>there's something else that i want to<br>fill the further time with it's a bit<br>more<br>current and a bit more recent so<br>basically<br>this is what the distribution model of<br>your typical medium earth orbit or<br>geostationary satellite looks like so<br>you have a link that's coming in from a<br>satellite and it goes down to some isp<br>on the island and the isp then sort of<br>distributes the traffic<br>to the user so what does this mean in<br>its bare bones configuration it means<br>that if you're watching a cat video it<br>has to come down the satellite link and<br>then it has to go down the link from the<br>internet service providers data center<br>to the end user<br>so if a second user wants to have a look<br>at the same<br>cad video then it has to come down the<br>link a second time and remember the link<br>itself is<br>a very very constrained capacity we want<br>to keep as much traffic as possible off<br>this<br>so what we can in principle do here and<br>this is what we're doing here in new<br>zealand even with our you know high<br>capacity international fiber links<br>is we put a content delivery network<br>server um somewhere<br>uh<br>you know locally typically either at the<br>isp or close to the isp<br>and that's where the first copy of the<br>cat video that arrives on the island<br>gets cached and then if several end<br>users want it they get redirected to<br>that cdn server and they download it to<br>their local machines<br>advantage is there if it goes viral on<br>the island we have hundreds of people<br>looking at it<br>there's only one copy that has to go by<br>the satellite link everything else is<br>handled locally by the cdn server so<br>we've conserved capacity on the link<br>so<br>enter the new kid on the block<br>okay who's sort of elon musk<br>everybody has tesla and spacex and so<br>now starlink is the internet<br>satellite internet division of<br>of spacex and they've put over 2000<br>satellites now in orbit<br>to basically provide internet service<br>and they're quite different<br>from any other internet service that's<br>been offered from space so far in that<br>these are so called low earth orbit<br>satellites so unlike the medium earth<br>orbit satellites which sit about 8 000<br>kilometers above the equator<br>these sit at any latitude between about<br>at the moment about<br>53 south and 53 north<br>and they fly at an altitude of around<br>about<br>550 kilometers<br>and<br>so what this means in practice<br>is um<br>that we got a lot of them congregating<br>around the 53rd parallel so here's a<br>look from the south<br>so you can see there's a lot more white<br>dots these are the satellites a lot more<br>white dots around the southern end of<br>the range than there are over the<br>pacific you can see the dot density down<br>here is much much larger why is the soil<br>very very simple<br>when<br>when these satellites orbit<br>they're basically on a circular orbit<br>around the earth they go up to 53<br>degrees north come back to 53 degrees<br>south and in doing so in a full orbit<br>they cross every parallel exactly twice<br>except for the 53rd which i just touch<br>so<br>what that means is though that the<br>equator being the longest parallel<br>therefore<br>has the lowest density of crossings<br>per kilometer of parallel<br>whereas at 53 degrees which is the<br>shortest of those parallels um or the<br>shortest two of those parallels or just<br>under 53 degrees which is the shortest<br>of the parallels that we're flying over<br>they have the highest density and so<br>therefore you basically have most<br>satellites kind of congregating there<br>for a lot of time which means that if<br>you're using uh starlink then uh you<br>basically um<br>use this and ben could i get you to just<br>start the video on this one<br>on a video previous slide yep okay<br>cool so<br>so what you can see though so this is um<br>accelerated by a factor of 15. so what<br>you can see is the satellites either fly<br>in a northeasterly direction or in a<br>southeasterly direction<br>because this is the original styling<br>configuration or constellation there and<br>so you can see that they move quite<br>quickly and because they're not that<br>high up with 550 kilometers it also<br>means they move in and out of sight of<br>ground stations really really quickly<br>so<br>what does this mean now let's have a<br>quick look and see whether we can order<br>starlink<br>for you know for a place of interest so<br>i'm going to take you now to a place<br>called montana in the united states i'm<br>going to take you to a place called<br>kalispell has anyone ever been to<br>kalispell montana<br>great<br>well mike i know you would have been up<br>there you know this place okay so you<br>probably remember that it's not the<br>biggest of all places right<br>it's quite a you know it's quite a small<br>town<br>and it's<br>pretty much in the middle of nowhere so<br>and given the fact it's reasonably close<br>to 53 degrees north<br>you should be getting pretty good<br>service there especially because it's<br>surrounded by a number of<br>gateways that<br>that starling uses<br>and by the way does anyone know how what<br>the population of montana is<br>i looked it up it's just over a million<br>okay so<br>and<br>yes it's kind of available as long as<br>you're willing to wait until 2023<br>until you get service and this is<br>because they've hit capacity and keller<br>spell<br>now<br>why is this important now you've<br>probably all heard that starlink is<br>currently trying to provide<br>internet service to<br>to your crane<br>and the way you read it in the media you<br>could get the idea<br>that styling single-handedly will<br>replace<br>all of the other internet services in<br>the ukraine<br>um can i just quietly point out that<br>they can't even serve everybody on<br>montana<br>now the ukraine even if you take all the<br>refugees out that have left they still<br>have almost 40 million people left in<br>the country<br>and um they're only one and a half times<br>larger than montana<br>you really believe they'll be able to<br>replace the internet over there i don't<br>think so anyway<br>um<br>a couple of weeks ago they started<br>publishing this this coverage map and in<br>fact if you go up to the<br>to the northern us you see those sort of<br>few spots<br>that um<br>that basically are wait listed and<br>kalispell happens to be in one of those<br>whitelisted spots and in fact if you<br>zoom into that map you notice it's<br>essentially around all the population<br>centers where american suburbanites sit<br>uh who previously have been sitting on<br>cable modems which are notoriously uh<br>low bandwidth and would love to get<br>starlink and they can't get it because<br>they haven't got enough system capacity<br>up there the other thing you neatly see<br>here is that basically anyone who's or<br>almost anyone who's run the tropics<br>is essentially uh devoid of styling<br>there's virtually no no gateways around<br>there notable exceptions are hawaii<br>which isn't actually on the screen here<br>at the moment and interestingly enough<br>the chatham islands<br>you know despite the fact that the<br>chatham islands are literally about 900<br>k's away from the closest gateway in<br>in the heinz so<br>why is this oh yeah so<br>going the right way right so essentially<br>um<br>oh this is color spell where did the<br>other slide go disappear yes it has<br>disappeared anyway so apparently you can<br>get it and get it in<br>in uh<br>in the chatham islands now but i'm<br>pretty sure it's not gonna be continuous<br>connectivity because there's just not<br>enough satellites continuously between<br>mainland new zealand and um<br>and uh and the chatham islands in order<br>to continue uh a guaranteed continuous<br>coverage i mean even here in auckland<br>you apparently still get altar just um<br>every uh every few hours um because<br>there's not enough satellite coverage<br>here we're too far north<br>anyway so<br>basically if we want to improve<br>connectivity in remote islands in the<br>pacific<br>will starling be our solution and um<br>right you may remember that little news<br>story here from middle of<br>january<br>exploding in tonga and<br>those of you who have known me for a<br>while<br>know that i've got a bit of a relation<br>to tonga in the sense that i had a phd<br>student from there was the first<br>edward cocker who was the<br>first tongan to get a phd in computer<br>science and of course this was highly<br>interesting and<br>so when this thing went off it was<br>the international cable that connects<br>tonga to fiji<br>uh went down and it went on it went down<br>about an hour 45 minutes<br>after the eruption<br>and the eruption was literally initially<br>a single burst a single pulse from the<br>volcano<br>and<br>as you may remember there were people<br>uploading videos of the tsunami hitting<br>tongatapu<br>and they wouldn't have been able to<br>upload those given the fact that there<br>was no satellite service out of tonga at<br>the time they would have had to upload<br>those via the international cable and<br>it's very very clear that the<br>international cable was still operating<br>at the time<br>so i got in touch with shane cronin and<br>i asked him hey you know<br>what's happening here you know why would<br>um the cable fail<br>uh literally<br>an hour on a 45 hour 45 minutes after<br>the explosion and you know quite a<br>considerable time after the tsunami as<br>well<br>and um<br>so um basically the next thing that<br>happened is the cable was away<br>was out of service<br>and the only thing that worked were sort<br>of very low band was satellite<br>telephones and a bit of high frequency<br>communication from<br>various embassies and high commissions<br>in no car loafer<br>and<br>um<br>then shane retty um the national mp<br>basically<br>sent a tweet off to elon musk and said<br>hey you know can you<br>help and elon's first response was<br>ah nah probably not not really so that<br>was honest um and then later on he<br>basically realized hey this is a this is<br>a way of um<br>uh of uh<br>uh you know showcasing what starling can<br>do and he said it dispatched a team of<br>engineers to fiji to put on a gateway at<br>suva and<br>i actually went public at the time and i<br>said look this is really a bit of a<br>non-starter because tonga is too far<br>away from fiji for proper service and<br>there's also other reasons why it<br>doesn't work around the rna we already<br>know the satellite density up there so<br>tonga is about 20 degrees south<br>satellite density is quite low but also<br>and this is an important thing<br>is because it's close to the equator<br>there's another thing and this is<br>regulatory so when you have a low earth<br>orbit satellite and you're in a part of<br>the world where when you're transmitting<br>up to the satellite<br>and there happens to be within 18<br>degrees of that satellite happens to be<br>a geostationary satellite in the<br>background then you're not allowed to<br>transmit<br>so all those little dishy<br>terminals that um<br>that that styling uses by the way dishi<br>doesn't mean that it's a dish it's a<br>so-called<br>phased array which is actually quite an<br>engineering achievement for starlink<br>previously the sort of technology was<br>used by the military and cost millions<br>of dollars each um now they brought it<br>into a box that's about a thousand u.s<br>ballpark<br>and so basically<br>they went to all this effort and then<br>they sent 50 terminals or just over 50<br>terminals<br>to<br>tonga and they got a lot of media<br>mileage out of this you know basically<br>starling comes to the rescue<br>and<br>all great and wonderful except there<br>were geostationary providers who thrown<br>over a gigabit per second off capacity<br>at tonga already at the time<br>they didn't really even get get a foot<br>on the door publicity wise despite the<br>fact that some of them were really doing<br>it out of the goodness of their heart<br>more than anything<br>and<br>then of course<br>starling only went live a day after<br>the uh international cable got<br>reconnected to tongatapu which removed<br>literally about almost 90 percent of the<br>need uh for connectivity that had<br>existed beforehand and literally<br>restored this this to them<br>and um ever since it's not quite clear<br>what's happened to those 50 terminals<br>um but apparently<br>intermittently when us when a satellite<br>was in the right con<br>right position they were able to give<br>really really good data rights hundreds<br>of megabits per second but that's not<br>surprising because they would have been<br>the only users on the satellite<br>so<br>just looking at that international cable<br>from tonga there's a little curiosity i<br>want to point out to you and again sort<br>of came out of me reaching out to shane<br>cronin from geology who's the resident<br>volcanologist here at the university of<br>auckland who looks after hong kong hong<br>kong and<br>you know if you've sort of<br>seen international media he's been out<br>on the bbc a few times and elsewhere<br>as a snorkeling professor and shane<br>basically um<br>and i was sort of looking at traces as<br>to where the cable ship went because<br>there was very sparse communication<br>coming from the cable ship and whatever<br>came came by tonga cable and they of<br>course didn't have a good connection<br>themselves so they got very very trigger<br>data so we looked at what came of the<br>ais positioning system uh on the boat<br>and so we could see the close of tonga<br>topo so the squiggly line that you see<br>here this is the nominal cable route and<br>what they were trying to do is they were<br>basically trying to find the end of the<br>cable or cable pieces that they could<br>reuse because they didn't have enough<br>cable on board they had 60 kilometers of<br>cable on board when they left from the<br>depot and suva<br>every cable spare that they could find<br>in the entire pacific that was<br>compatible for the cable they took and<br>they had to repair 90 kilometers of<br>cable so they actually had to pull some<br>of that cable and the cable that's down<br>there is very very similar to the one<br>that's passing around at the moment<br>and<br>they had to fish stuff off the seafloor<br>in order to get at it and<br>of course we were quite interested to<br>see what they would find on the sea<br>floor and um over here in this western<br>theater of operations so eastern theater<br>of operation that was the western<br>theater as well<br>they were able to use their remote<br>operated underwater vehicle and they're<br>sort of traced and ever so often they<br>brought a piece up this is what you can<br>sort of see as those perpendicular lines<br>here these are so called holding drives<br>where basically the cable ship goes<br>drags a kind of a plow behind it and the<br>plow basically picks up the cable and<br>brings it up to the surface<br>and<br>then they were basically following<br>further on uh with their remotely<br>operated vehicle and you can see over<br>here suddenly they are diverted from the<br>nominal cable route by about five<br>kilometers<br>where they finally picked up the end of<br>the cable now can i point something out<br>to you<br>this is the direction to the volcano the<br>volcano is up here somewhere<br>right now normally when you think about<br>an explosion<br>and you know you've all seen hollywood<br>movies with explosions and you know<br>people sort of flying through the air<br>and all the sort of stuff right they fly<br>away from the point of explosion the<br>the point of explosion<br>was up here<br>and this traveled about five kilometers<br>towards the point of explosion and not<br>only did it do that it also traveled<br>several hundred meters uphill<br>right which basically shows you that<br>things that happen under water are<br>sometimes really really really weird<br>and so we don't know at this point<br>whether this is a pyroclastic density<br>current that came off hungar that did<br>this and that sneaked around<br>um and they do this quite a bit neva<br>neva's done a few simulations on this<br>and if i had a bit more time order would<br>have possibly shown you one of those um<br>but basically um there's also the<br>possibility<br>that um<br>a slope at a seamand a bit further<br>further south would have been triggered<br>that would have washed this further up<br>to give you an idea just off of scale<br>here this is like having a cable like<br>this here and seeing it washed up up and<br>running total so this is this is the<br>sort of stuff that you're you're having<br>involved here so what this tells us<br>though is that you know<br>fiber optic cables is great as there are<br>um if there's only one of them um you<br>have essentially a single point of<br>failure and those pyroclastic density<br>currents uh or for that matter<br>so turbidity currents which is the more<br>general class or pyroclastic means it's<br>caused by a volcano um<br>so what these do is they they're known<br>to kill uh uh kill undersea cables<br>there's a very well known case from 1929<br>the grand great banks earthquake of<br>alaska where<br>where one of those currents went down a<br>slope and they had about a dozen<br>transatlantic cables running across that<br>slope even back in 1929 and it took out<br>one after the other<br>over a time period of about 12 hours<br>and literally the position position of<br>the cable determined when it got taken<br>out here it was a bit more complicated<br>this cable probably got taken out<br>further west first by a current that<br>sneaked around from the eastern side of<br>honga around the north of honga and came<br>down on the western side whereas this<br>one probably got taken off a little<br>early i mean this is a going theory at<br>the moment anyway<br>okay so<br>let's bring starlink into the pacific<br>here for a moment or some other earth<br>operator that uses the same type of<br>business model and what they do is they<br>don't go and talk to isps normally they<br>tend to like to talk really to the end<br>user immediately so basically what you<br>have is you have your own personal<br>satellite link at home<br>and<br>so if we have a cat video that's going<br>viral<br>then there's no way<br>of placing one of those content delivery<br>servers on the island so we have to<br>bring all of those cat videos for all of<br>the thousand users on the island over<br>the satellite link individually every<br>time<br>and that's quite a bit of a strain on<br>the resources on the bandwidth that<br>we've got available totally on those<br>satellites to give you a bit of an idea<br>the current total<br>estimated system capacity of starlink<br>is less than the total connected<br>capacity of australia and new zealand<br>together and this is the worldwide<br>capacity for styling right not just<br>not just uh not not not just for for our<br>part of the world here and<br>we use for our terrestrial cable<br>connections we use content delivery<br>services for good reason and here they<br>can't really avail themselves off<br>of those because of that particular<br>business model that they've chosen<br>so<br>okay<br>so going back to starting for a moment<br>you know again solos orbit satellite<br>such as starling they can only basically<br>at this point uh bridge<br>um between two ground stations and they<br>can only do this for a short time<br>so um basically this is because they fly<br>on fairly quickly and we've seen this in<br>the simulation earlier on<br>so what this means is that sooner or<br>later one of the satellites will go so<br>low down to the horizon of the horizon<br>that will basically set like the sun or<br>the moon and you can't see it anymore<br>and then you can't communicate with it<br>anymore so you need to hand over to<br>another satellite if that works and it's<br>workable okay hunky-dory if that's not<br>workable what you have to do is you have<br>to use<br>inter-satellite routing and this means<br>using you know one or<br>one or more additional satellites<br>as intermediate stepping stones uh<br>between uh your internet gateway ground<br>station and the end user ground station<br>so the question is how do you find a<br>route<br>between two ground stations in a network<br>like this<br>so when we teach our students our<br>graduate students uh sometimes<br>final year students about routing<br>we tell them about algorithms such as<br>dijkstra's or bellman ford<br>or<br>link states or<br>ospf or whatever right so<br>so the problem with all of these is that<br>they really assume that your network's<br>going to be fairly static so that any<br>changes to the network are relatively<br>infrequent<br>and<br>that when when they do happen<br>they basically propagate uh over a<br>certain amount of time<br>across the network uh to<br>where the information needs to sit<br>the problem that you're having here and<br>this is really now time to get the<br>movie going yep<br>so the problem that you're having here<br>is of course it's all really moving<br>quickly right<br>and<br>so moreover<br>even over the ground stations you're not<br>dealing with the same satellite that<br>you're up linking to or downlinking from<br>every time<br>so<br>what can we do here and um<br>so when you're talking to starlink or<br>rather what starling has have let the<br>world know and they're very very<br>secretive they don't really like talking<br>to scientists<br>we tell too many things to me too many<br>people they're going to be using space<br>lasers which sounds really great you<br>know you all know this from<br>you know from star wars and<br>spaceship enterprise and stuff like this<br>so we all know space lasers are a great<br>thing right this is what they use in the<br>movies but they're not really telling us<br>about how those space lasers work or how<br>many they're going to have on each<br>satellite so i'm going to tell you a<br>little bit why this makes a difference<br>so assuming for a moment that<br>you have a bunch of low-earth orbit<br>satellites and they all have three space<br>lasers each and we're going to point<br>them<br>at the closest neighboring satellites in<br>order to to to make their communication<br>work and somehow those those neighboring<br>satellites will pick this up<br>so<br>this is what we get with this bunch of<br>satellites here and we have so some<br>links going going on you know further<br>away from this<br>but that immediately causes us a problem<br>into satellite link it's very<br>straightforward because what we need is<br>a laser a gimbal to point that laser at<br>a remote<br>receiver at another satellite and so<br>basically the number of gimbals that we<br>need on our satellite to do this is<br>essentially the number of outgoing links<br>but now we have essentially a design<br>choice to make on the receiving<br>satellite so<br>what we can do is we can for example<br>take a zoom lens and point it back at<br>the transmitting satellite the advantage<br>of this is that we can discriminate<br>between very very small nuances of<br>brightness on the incoming laser which<br>actually allows us to use those<br>differences in brightness to<br>send additional information over that<br>over that of that laser link<br>right<br>but when we do this then we really have<br>to decide how many receiving zoom lenses<br>we're going to allow ourselves to have<br>and immediately we run into a problem<br>because the number of outgoing links to<br>nearest neighbors that we're going to<br>have is not necessarily the number of<br>in-going links that we need<br>because um<br>the<br>the say three nearest neighbors that we<br>have<br>we may not be among the three nearest no<br>nearest neighbors of those three<br>neighbors right so they don't<br>necessarily point something back at us<br>moreover other satellites who are not<br>among our three nearest neighbors may be<br>pointing their lasers back at us and we<br>need some way of receiving those so the<br>question is are we going to have more<br>gimbals for with receivers of course we<br>could do this and the question is how<br>many do we need and of course all this<br>drives the cost per satellite up and it<br>also makes the satellite more complex<br>more prone to failure and that sort of<br>thing<br>right so this is a bit of an issue<br>so<br>the other problem that you can get is if<br>you only get to you go to closest<br>neighbor<br>then you might get clusters forming<br>basically subsets of satellites that are<br>war<br>among their own closest neighbors and<br>that way if you're trying to forward<br>into satellite you can only forward<br>within that little group you never get<br>to the rest of the world with it<br>so all those are issues and in order to<br>really tell what starling is going to do<br>when they're going to bring their space<br>lasers into operation we'd need to know<br>all this but they're not really telling<br>right so<br>anyway uh we're speculating as to what<br>they might do and as part of the<br>speculation<br>toby tomkinson who was my research<br>assistant and uh sort of shaping up to<br>be a good grading student in the in the<br>department<br>um he basically uh spent the tail end of<br>a summer<br>summer project was needed something else<br>for the summer project but then had a<br>bit of time left so we spent on<br>spend time on simulating a protocol here<br>which we've developed in which we just<br>recently uh submitted a paper for on and<br>so so the idea here is that<br>we're assuming that we're using<br>receivers that are omnidirectional so<br>we're not using a zoom lens we're using<br>a wide angle lens<br>and<br>so this means we can take as many<br>incoming lasers as we want<br>this might affect the bitrate a little<br>bit but then so be it<br>and so what we're also doing is we're<br>saying okay<br>the receiving ground station will have a<br>particular ipv6 address now ipv6<br>addresses that the new internet<br>addresses they've been around for about<br>10 years and there's gazillions of them<br>so there's plenty of them and so the<br>idea is that every geographical location<br>on earth should be associated with a<br>subset of those ipv6 addresses<br>so when an uplinking gateway or a<br>satellite that's meant to forward to a<br>particular destination sees this ipv6<br>address it can look up where the<br>geographical coordinates of<br>the destination ground station are<br>so<br>what it will do is we'll then it will<br>then completely compute a great circle<br>path<br>um to their destination great circle<br>paths there's something that uh you know<br>people who do flying for example know<br>that's the shortest distance across the<br>curvature of the earth<br>to a particular destination and so the<br>idea is we're now going to be using<br>an nearest neighbor routing to try and<br>get to that destination<br>and so if we start off with uh three<br>outgoing into satellite links and ben if<br>you could start that please um then<br>yeah it's not yeah so okay so this is<br>just<br>my my spiel so if we forward a little<br>bit so we get<br>and yep that's okay we should be<br>okay so yeah so if we're doing this and<br>we only have three links available you<br>know this is the cheap version of the<br>satellite remember only three outgoing<br>lasers we get stuff that's only going<br>off vaguely in the correct direction but<br>it can go in loops and bounce and bits<br>and pieces like this<br>right and it's anything but a direct<br>path and it's not really desirable<br>now if you're willing to go up to sort<br>of media mid-range<br>satellite and you're allowing yourself<br>two more gimbals and you have five then<br>you can see it gets a lot smoother we're<br>staying a a lot closer to the direct<br>path here by the way there's a path<br>between auckland<br>and pitcairn island<br>uh uh you know mutiny off the uh<br>on the bounty<br>in case you can't remember what pitcain<br>is all about so it's a few dozen people<br>over there<br>and so you can see it's a lot better but<br>if we<br>allow ourselves to have eight outgoing<br>links<br>then you can see we're getting even<br>smoother so basically the more we spend<br>on our satellite the more gimbals for<br>outgoing links we use um the more<br>smoothly we can route this and um the<br>the the better our result we get so the<br>neat thing about this<br>particular rotting algorithm is that we<br>can really distribute this across the<br>satellite fleet nobody has to have a<br>complete picture about where the other<br>satellites are it works with multiple<br>shells of satellites where we have not<br>just one constellation but multiple<br>constellations interacting with each<br>other<br>so<br>and we're thinking that maybe maybe<br>maybe this is this is what styling might<br>be doing but again uh we'll find out<br>next year hopefully maybe if they're<br>willing to talk to us about this<br>so<br>hang on um<br>right and that really brings me to my<br>conclusion<br>and i've gone a bit over time so<br>basically<br>getting people to use cloud computing<br>requires a good internet connection a<br>lot of people out there don't have this<br>and there's no real silver bullet um to<br>solve that problem<br>satellite service is expensive it's not<br>ideal it's it's low performance<br>generally<br>but the good thing is that progress in<br>the satellite domain is being made<br>whether that'll<br>you know be able to<br>eventually provision systems that allow<br>us to<br>you know get these these places to catch<br>up i don't know<br>cables are much much better<br>but that's obviously a matter of finding<br>the money to get them there and they're<br>quite expensive to put in<br>but as you've seen in tonga they can<br>also present single points of failure<br>and<br>so one of the things that i'm currently<br>sort of trying to do is<br>wave the idea under people's noises that<br>if we are wanting to keep islands in the<br>pacific in our good books and i think<br>the australian and new zealand<br>government and maybe the american<br>government are just waking up to this<br>then it might just be a good idea to<br>actually pay for those cables and the<br>reason why this is also important is<br>because as we<br>uh you know in new zealand look at our<br>own connectivity we've only got five<br>outgoing cables right<br>and the more cables we have the harder<br>it gets to cut those cables<br>and pretend that it wasn't anybody's<br>fault<br>and also we get a lot more resilience<br>and robustness in the pacific white<br>system<br>and uh these cables while they're<br>expensive to lie<br>they're a hell of a lot cheaper than the<br>all the military hardware that people<br>tend to send uh you know around this<br>this part of the world<br>in order to protect their assets here<br>so um basically you know for one frigate<br>you can um<br>you know buy two or three trans-pacific<br>cables and then if you have sort of um<br>you know islands in the pacific that are<br>you know sort of nodes that bring<br>several cable systems together then they<br>would add quite a bit of resilience<br>together so i'm kind of trying to wipe<br>this under people's noses a bit because<br>i think that would make a lot of sense<br>and also it would of course help our<br>friends in the islands to finally fully<br>partake in cloud computing and all the<br>benefits that has to offer uh real cloud<br>computing because the personal clouds<br>are already available in the islands<br>so<br>styling and other leo systems they're<br>certainly part of the picture but<br>they're not a qro because of the limited<br>capacity they have and because of the<br>business models that they use<br>but they can certainly fill gaps and<br>they can they can be a good backstop on<br>things and i think that's probably where<br>they're going to be sitting<br>at least for the medium term<br>um so with that um i'd like to say thank<br>you for paying attention tonight and i<br>hope you found this interesting and if<br>you've got any questions then of course<br>so<br>long term 100 years from now is it going<br>to be all cable or<br>is satellite still going to play a part<br>um<br>this depends a lot on whether we'll<br>still be able to launch satellites in a<br>hundred a hundred years time at the<br>moment the amount of junk that we're<br>putting up there is humongous so it's<br>something i didn't really talk about um<br>so basically in a hundred years time you<br>know will we have cables where we have<br>satellites so<br>i think we'll have a lot more cables<br>than we have now uh people will see this<br>as a you know far more necessary part of<br>infrastructure it'll be part of<br>education it'll be part of just general<br>disaster resilience and stuff like this<br>i mean if you look at tonga for example<br>the amount of money that was spent<br>by bringing the wrong aid deliveries<br>together and transporting them to tonga<br>just to find out that they weren't<br>needed over there because there was too<br>little bandwidth from tower to<br>communicate to new zealand what people<br>actually needed um that alone makes<br>projects that like that to to a good<br>extent worthwhile and the other thing<br>that's around it is you know certainly<br>resilience against natural disasters<br>resilience against you know foreign<br>malicious actors uh you know going<br>around cutting cables and<br>um you know for example it's well known<br>that uh for example the russians have<br>been uh you know<br>around europe and the mediterranean have<br>been showing an unnatural large amount<br>of interest with their research ships<br>you know in you know various uh<br>international cable locations<br>so this is very much on the radar of<br>foreign militaries i can tell you that<br>one<br>um<br>but<br>ultimately i think we'll probably see a<br>lot more cable we'll probably see better<br>satellite systems than we have them at<br>the moment<br>but<br>i think satellite ultimately probably be<br>more a backstop um and it'll probably be<br>more something that'll be handling uh<br>internet of things in remote locations<br>where you simply cannot run a cable so<br>for example if you're going to aircraft<br>if we're going to ships<br>and you know there's a lot of talk at<br>the moment for example about robotic<br>ships and robotic aircraft um that are<br>you know uh you know accrual is<br>pilotless and in order to control those<br>in international airspace on on the high<br>seas you do need satellite capacity and<br>satellite<br>you know facilities in order to control<br>those and monitor those and i think this<br>is probably more where the satellites<br>will eventually end up end up serving<br>that of course<br>all assumes that uh you know a lot of<br>the islands that we'd like to serve now<br>will still be above water in 100 years<br>time<br>um so that's that's also one of those<br>things right further questions<br>okay<br>so<br>one of the problem is that uh you know<br>where the cables are landing they don't<br>have them in the actual infrastructure<br>or i mean they might have like very old<br>machines i mean most of them i think<br>that they're running<br>uh software<br>uh<br>so when you talk about like having you<br>know the<br>benefits of a cloud going to visit the<br>design i think there are other kind of<br>there are certainly other kind of issues<br>are you absolutely right and in fact the<br>bad connectivity is actually partly at<br>the root of those issues there's a<br>little nice story to tell here so in<br>2015<br>i was working<br>up on a project in the cook islands and<br>i was talking<br>to the uh<br>you know then head off the uh<br>uh off the internet user the internet<br>society in the cook islands and i found<br>out that internet users in the cook<br>islands were really really angry<br>with<br>telecom comp islands for basically<br>providing such a bad service and i kept<br>telling them look it's not really their<br>fault it's all they can afford<br>and it's uh it's the best they can do<br>and they haven't designed the tcp<br>protocol so um you know that that they<br>can't really prevent that tcpq<br>oscillation<br>and then one day i got an absolute irate<br>email from from the woman and she<br>basically said you know they've gone<br>really through the roof they've charged<br>a lot of us hundreds of dollars in<br>excess data volume fees<br>this was the time when microsoft started<br>rolling out windows 10<br>and<br>microsoft was really really generous if<br>he had a previous windows version he had<br>automatic updates turned on as had a lot<br>of the internet society people in the<br>islands<br>then you would be getting all the<br>pre-installed files<br>for windows 10<br>put onto your machine<br>for free<br>for free upgrade just in case you wanted<br>it as part of your monthly update cycle<br>all 5.6 gigabytes of it<br>so the problem<br>with that of course is that a lot of<br>people in the cook islands at the time<br>were on one gigabyte or two gigabyte a<br>month plans<br>so<br>this really put them out of<br>you know out of their quota and a lot of<br>them<br>and of course the billing software at<br>telecom cook islands completely ignored<br>that that just got built for what what<br>extra they used and a lot of them<br>weren't even aware that this had<br>happened in fact there was almost<br>nothing you can find you could find<br>about it i happened to stumble about the<br>the answer to the riddle by coincidence<br>on a german mailing list<br>where people said hey you know what's<br>that funny folder and and your you know<br>windows root directory you know all<br>about and um<br>then<br>somebody said oh it's the it's the<br>windows it's the windows 10 upgrade<br>files<br>and<br>so i i read that and i sent<br>an email to my contact in the cook items<br>and said look can you go to your to your<br>machine and tell me whether you've got<br>the following folder on your machine and<br>um how big it is and uh how old it is<br>and she got back to me and said yeah<br>it's all darren's 5.6 gigabytes and said<br>look no further that's what's cost you<br>all that money<br>and it's actually microsoft's fault<br>they assumed that everybody would have a<br>great internet connection<br>and try to be very generous with<br>everybody but they didn't take into<br>account that there were people on volume<br>charging in the cook islands and you<br>know probably elsewhere<br>who got hit very very badly with us and<br>in the end<br>they sort of split the bill um i think<br>telecom cook islands gave them we gave<br>everybody an an extra two or three<br>gigabytes for that month and then<br>build them for the rest but this is the<br>sort of stuff that can happen of course<br>what also happens security wise is that<br>because<br>um it's so difficult to download any<br>file of any length and and this tcp<br>corresponds quite insidious so if you<br>only have a very very small file to<br>download so your typical web browsing is<br>consists of mostly small files that's<br>okay<br>but when you're then having a large<br>download to make like a large video in<br>one one block or you're having a large<br>piece of software to download like your<br>typical software upgrades your typical<br>windows cab files and so on um that<br>is enormously um<br>you know<br>enormously time consuming because tcp<br>under q oscillation slows down to a very<br>very low rate<br>and so a lot of people get frustrated<br>with this and that's why they're turning<br>anything off<br>that's slowing their internet connection<br>down and this very often means that<br>automatic updates get turned off<br>and so as a result of that what happens<br>typically when one of those countries<br>switches from satellite<br>to uh to cable the next thing that<br>they're getting is a serious infestation<br>of<br>you know malware all around the island<br>because literally the whole full force<br>of the internet now hits a fleet of<br>machines that haven't been upgraded in<br>years<br>um and so what organizations like ap<br>nick for example you know have been<br>doing to to to to combat this is that<br>before that connection happens they send<br>a team with the lightest patches into<br>the islands and they try and upgrade as<br>many machines as possible up there as<br>they possibly can in order to minimize<br>the impact of this now of course they<br>don't ever catch everybody you know i<br>mean it wouldn't catch everybody here if<br>you did this<br>but it certainly mitigates the impact<br>and especially it makes sure that<br>professional users in the islands you<br>know the companies that you know the<br>people who are running significant<br>mission critical servers that at least<br>they're protected and that they're up to<br>date with their with their last stuff<br>but um it's the sort of stuff you need<br>to anticipate most certainly right<br>other questions yes<br>so you were talking before about keeping<br>pacific islands<br>you know in<br>their good graces uh when you're talking<br>about especially new zealand australia<br>and the us i was also wondering are<br>there any um<br>proposals from either the us or china<br>for um because i know the whole there's<br>this race for the pacific now where<br>you've got deals with solomon islands<br>are there are there proposals for either<br>they can affect players<br>from work connectivity<br>okay<br>so the questions are there any proposals<br>from the big players involved in the<br>tussle around per political influence in<br>the pacific uh as to uh you know<br>communications and yes you bet the<br>chinese have spotted this<br>you may be aware that the chinese<br>foreign minister is currently touring<br>the pacific<br>and<br>before he went on the trip he said he<br>was definitely one of wanting to talk<br>to countries about communications i'm<br>aware i'm having an incoming phd student<br>on a new zealand government scholarship<br>from kiribati and he told me recently<br>that the<br>kiribati government has been approached<br>by the chinese<br>abort or maybe<br>you know we can make an additional<br>satellite channel available to you or<br>maybe an entire satellite or something<br>like this<br>and<br>and you know you could also see this for<br>example<br>after the tongan<br>volcano i mean when the chinese turned<br>up with their ship they had 500 flat<br>pack houses on that ship<br>right and that was way more aid than the<br>australians and the new zealanders and<br>everybody else bought and combined all<br>right whether they needed the flat pack<br>houses i'm not entirely sure but um i<br>think they got them now<br>but obviously<br>uh you know these are you know these you<br>know these are things that you know are<br>part of the game of influence in the<br>pacific which has been played for for<br>for decades and the and the funny thing<br>is that communication is now sort of you<br>know going you know a much more center<br>stage compared to what it used to it<br>used to be beforehand and so<br>again it's probably a relatively cheap<br>way of uh you know integrating the<br>pacific and making sure that they're not<br>being treated like a backwater because<br>at the moment what we're doing is we're<br>basically leaving it up to individual<br>pacific islands to go and say<br>we'd really like to have cable and so<br>the next thing that happens is<br>they go to the world bank and say how<br>many million are were you willing to<br>loan us they go to the asian development<br>bank how many million are you willing to<br>loan us um then they're gonna go to all<br>sorts of other donors uh you know usaid<br>nz8 aussie<br>you know and so on and they're basically<br>literally groveling for money they're<br>taking out loans they're<br>you know leaning you know leaning on all<br>sorts of um<br>and sometimes fairly sometimes fairly<br>dodgy wise just in order to bring the<br>finance together<br>and you know then once once they've<br>bought um their system put in they sit<br>on a huge loan that they sometimes have<br>difficulty paying back<br>and<br>at the same time<br>you know for example we in the school of<br>computer science are under constant<br>pressure to improve outcomes for pacific<br>island students now a great deal of the<br>problem that we're facing<br>is that a certain percentage of our<br>pacific island students for example<br>during during covert were actually in<br>the islands they couldn't come here and<br>what did we do we threw all of the<br>lectures onto video and<br>well try and watch a video through one<br>of those those geostationary satellite<br>links good luck i mean you know you can<br>wait for a day for a 10 minute video to<br>download so they were literally cut off<br>from what we were doing<br>and um<br>so<br>for all practical purposes um you know<br>it makes them feel like they're<br>forgotten they're like like like they're<br>a backwater<br>and you know yes there are a long way<br>away but they're on the way to somewhere<br>else right they're on the way between us<br>and the us right a large amount of the<br>data that we're consuming here in new<br>zealand comes from the united states or<br>through the united states almost every<br>internet<br>you know internet content that we're<br>getting from asia almost every internet<br>content that we're getting obviously<br>from north america but almost every<br>internet content that we're getting<br>from europe as well<br>comes via the united states and there's<br>a lot of islands between us and the<br>united states and in order to add<br>resilience to that path<br>we'd be much much better off investing<br>in that infrastructure going over there<br>and at the same time integrating the<br>islands and giving them those much<br>needed second and third cables as well<br>right i mean tonga<br>i've had the former ceo of tonga cable<br>write to me and say oh<br>with all you found out about what<br>happened to our cable there<br>does it even make sense given the number<br>of volcanoes that we have in the synergy<br>does it even make sense to lay cables<br>there and i said yes as long as you lay<br>more than one cable and you keep them<br>spatially apart<br>so that a single volcanic eruption<br>doesn't take all of them out<br>and um<br>but this is something that the pacific<br>islands themselves can't lift and you<br>know for us it might be something oh you<br>know we've got four or five cables this<br>is fine but the question is what would<br>you in a crisis situation uh what would<br>we do for example if a single you know<br>cable access point say for example we<br>have a you know large volcanic eruption<br>in the north of auckland um it takes out<br>the cable path to takapuna beach where<br>the southern cross cable goes goes from<br>it takes off the the the domestic cable<br>path to manga phi heads it takes out the<br>path to um<br>to the telecom satellite ground station<br>at the near walkworth and it takes up uh<br>some of the cable paths over tomorrow vi<br>well at that point we were almost cut<br>off right and you know<br>basically three quarters eighty percent<br>you know or more of our cable capacity<br>disappears in an instant right and okay<br>these are black swan events but we do<br>know black swan events happen from time<br>to time the question is are we a big<br>enough economy so we want to take that<br>risk right and the simple answer is i<br>think we're a big enough economy and<br>we're connected to big enough economies<br>further west<br>and you know further north fiji and so<br>on that we probably should think about<br>whether this is something that we would<br>want to afford<br>and um<br>so yeah so that definitely you know goes<br>into that<br>appreciation<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
