faculty of<br>education and social work<br>i call upon a student of that faculty<br>palimani fishyahi<br>i am delighted but also not surprised<br>that professional teaching fellow megan<br>clune is a recipient of the prestigious<br>teaching excellence award<br>i was a beard honours student under the<br>wolf fisher program<br>looking to advance my maths and science<br>expertise when i first met megan in 2020<br>megan was a program leader my course<br>lecturer and my dissertation supervisor<br>as someone who has had a distaste for<br>mathematics since primary school<br>sometimes i wondered why i applied to do<br>an honours degree that involved<br>mathematics but nevertheless i stopped<br>wondering<br>from the moment i met megan it was clear<br>that she is a teacher of utmost<br>integrity<br>she leads with kindness and respect<br>she is honest fair and always patient<br>what i think of teachers i'm sorry when<br>i think of teachers who epitomise the<br>term ethic of care<br>i think of meagan cloon<br>from the perspective of care ethics the<br>teacher as carer is interested in the<br>express needs of the students or those<br>being cared for<br>not just needs assumed by our<br>institution nor the curriculum<br>in essence<br>megan has superpowers<br>one of her many superpowers is her<br>ability to create a safe<br>teaching and learning environment<br>for all of her students to succeed and<br>to realise their potential<br>megan did this even in the midst of the<br>pandemic<br>making sure she catered to her students<br>needs during such unprecedented times<br>megan's other superpower is a creative<br>process in which she blends pedagogy and<br>digital technologies into her teaching<br>practice<br>if you know<br>megan taught and modeled how the<br>integration of<br>digital technologies can transform the<br>learning environment and the<br>opportunities it creates for ensuring<br>equitable access and engagement for all<br>learners<br>megan<br>i'm so proud and honored to be among<br>your presence you are not just an<br>educator you are an innovator you are a<br>change maker and in my eyes<br>foreign<br>we are now
