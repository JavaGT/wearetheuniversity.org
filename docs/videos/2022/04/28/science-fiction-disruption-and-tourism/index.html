everyone good day and good<br>evening depending on where you are in<br>the world you are very welcome to this<br>webinar on a new book in the channel<br>views future of tourism series entitled<br>science fiction disruption and tourism<br>next slide please<br>my name is oona mcmahon biddy i am one<br>of the book editors along with ian<br>newman and marianna segala and it's my<br>pleasure to welcome you and to chair<br>this session today so you might ask what<br>is the purpose of the book well it<br>recreates and invents the future of<br>tourism in a creative and disruptive<br>manner<br>reconceptualizing tourism<br>alternative and quantum leap thinking<br>that goes beyond the accepted view of<br>tourism<br>much um of tourism research we might say<br>is imaginable feasible and<br>evidence-based<br>science fiction on the other hand in<br>many ways is unimaginable impossible<br>radical and disruptive and it's this<br>sort of thinking that can help us in<br>disruptive times and in those disruptive<br>times that we're currently living in<br>hence the book<br>and we hope that this session will give<br>you a flavor of that thinking<br>so some housekeeping folks<br>each speaker will speak for 10 minutes<br>and the slides will be moved on so you<br>will hear um the speakers asking for<br>next slide<br>the session will be recorded and<br>registered attendees will receive a link<br>to the recording in due course which you<br>will be able to access on youtube the<br>webinar allows attendees to ask<br>questions at any time using a chat<br>function under the q a though the q a<br>round will be at the end of all the<br>presentations attendees are able to<br>upload questions indicating popular<br>questions you will not have the ability<br>to unmute yourselves or ask questions<br>verbally during the webinars<br>but during the q a session i will be<br>responsible for asking questions from<br>so the book is the seventh title in the<br>future of tourism series published by<br>channel vue and it is an important one<br>in the context of a disruptive changing<br>world that we live in all in attendees<br>have access to a discount offer of 40 of<br>all the books in the tourism future<br>series with the code fot<br>2022<br>and that's at the channel view website<br>and that offer is valid until the end of<br>march<br>so it is my pleasure to introduce five<br>thought provoking speakers all of whom<br>are contributors to the books or to the<br>book therefore it will give you a flavor<br>of the book<br>each speaker has 10 minutes<br>and either as i said before there will<br>be q a session at the end<br>so we have ian newman who's an associate<br>professor at victoria university of<br>wellington<br>ian is an advocate for the future of<br>tourism and new zealand's number one<br>sunderland fan<br>he will be exploring the central<br>contribution of the book which lies in<br>the theoretical framework it presents<br>for exploring a future or tourism based<br>on science fiction<br>leon garvich is also an associate<br>professor at victoria university of<br>wellington he uses a design theory<br>perspective which intertwines media<br>tourism futures and designed to explore<br>the disruptive potential of technology<br>to deliver experiences and the desire of<br>tourists to feel free from moral social<br>economic and political constraints in<br>their daily lives<br>mariette mcentee<br>is a acting head of department of<br>hospitality and tourism management at<br>ulster university in northern ireland<br>maria is going to explore the idea of<br>tourists as a plague of zombies within<br>the context of sustainability<br>next slide please<br>emily hawker is a postdoctoral fellow at<br>the university of lapland in finland<br>emily uses a narrative approach asking<br>you to imagine a typical day in the life<br>of a tourist exploring the idea of<br>environmental crises as something that<br>we assume we will have to face in the<br>future<br>and lastly mariana sagala is professor<br>at the university of perez in greece she<br>will explore how we can use science<br>fiction as a thinking machine or a means<br>to find new forms of tourism and<br>realizing that the future of tourism is<br>not the same as the past<br>and how it may require new ways of<br>conceptualizing the future<br>so i'm going to hand over to ian first<br>ian<br>good morning new zealand good morning<br>ulster um good morning finland and good<br>morning in the world um so it's great to<br>be here<br>um<br>basically<br>we started this book oh three<br>three years ago four years ago that's<br>when we came up with the idea and<br>basically<br>right at the heart of why you're going<br>to do something is it's where your<br>passion is and i've always been a<br>passionate person about science fiction<br>you know i grew up with captain kirk and<br>star trek<br>uh logan's run soylent green<br>and robbie the robot so<br>and there was always something in those<br>science fiction films which had a grain<br>of truth with them and i think somebody<br>once said to me if you look at the old<br>series of star trek the original one<br>from the 1966 1968<br>everything in there has probably come<br>true in the terms of<br>you know the telecommunicator which is<br>the<br>the tele deck um which is virtual<br>reality um they've all sort of<br>come true and there's a resonance with<br>them today so i've always had this<br>seed in me about<br>science fiction and then you become an<br>academic and what does it mean<br>so to start off with if you look at some<br>of the films of science fiction and some<br>of the books to do with science fiction<br>the voice got that link<br>and um i always<br>a number of films resonated with me in<br>the terms of covet 19 and where that was<br>so if you read dean kudzen's book the<br>eyes of darkness you know that was a<br>book from the 1980s and right at the<br>center of that book is<br>um<br>there's this virus that's escapes from a<br>laboratory in china called wuhan 400.<br>but unfortunately it's not like corbett<br>19 everybody that gets that virus are<br>turned into zombies and they all die<br>so it's not quite it's not quite the<br>same but if you look at other films<br>about outbreak<br>pandemics and epidemics of what goes on<br>and when you look at those authors and<br>what they've written so basically look<br>look they looked at corvette 19 they<br>looked at sarge one that looked at that<br>type of thing<br>and said what would this what would this<br>mean in the science fiction context so<br>within science fiction<br>there's all that there's always that<br>gender of truth there's always that seed<br>of where we take it what we do<br>next slide please<br>so um<br>basically<br>what's the value of science fiction and<br>the value of science fiction to me has<br>always been it's a thinking machine<br>it allows you to think about the future<br>and think about tourism<br>and and think about it in a very<br>implausible way it's that what if<br>question in futures thinking and in<br>scenario planning and also the advantage<br>of science science fiction it's very<br>visual it's very impact it's a big story<br>it's very colorful so you can see what<br>it is and as to say a picture is 10 000<br>words and more it's a good genre to<br>communicate a message<br>next<br>next please<br>so in the terms of why we did this book<br>and what it's all about we're living in<br>a world at the moment of corvette 19 or<br>we've gone through it and when you have<br>a dystopian scenario a world which<br>from dystopia you want to reimagine<br>tourism<br>and what would that world look beyond<br>covet 19 and we can frame that<br>in a science fiction paradigm next slide<br>please<br>so<br>um fundamentally science fiction is a<br>very broad genre it's fundamentally a<br>series of speculations it's that what if<br>question<br>it could happen it takes the essence of<br>science the seeds of science things that<br>are in the laboratory and a lot of<br>and basically a lot of it's around<br>technology you take the concept of<br>futurism and that is italian genre a lot<br>of science and technology and science<br>fiction so it's taking the stories of<br>science and giving it a story hence the<br>and to me if you look at the very<br>where we are with research in general in<br>academia and tourism research in<br>particular it's all about academic<br>outputs we tend to think about what's<br>plausible so when you're writing an<br>academic paper goes to review you know<br>very much reviewers will turn around and<br>say is this plausible is this real<br>and so that we have we have<br>research and tourism is is bounded we<br>don't think the impossible so how can<br>you think be impossible how can you<br>think about these major events that<br>would impact on tourism and how tourism<br>would<br>would reshape in a very radical way<br>so to me tourism research is constrained<br>by<br>plausibility we don't think the<br>impossible and if you think the<br>impossible that's all about innovation<br>and creativity and alternative paradigms<br>so<br>and today we live in this world where<br>it's full of uncertainty<br>um the world is about uncertainty<br>complexity<br>um where does what is the future and how<br>the distinction between the present and<br>the future is very very blurred<br>the world to the moment does not know<br>it's that<br>uncertainty that we surround and when<br>we're predicting what what will happen<br>next year or the year after<br>it's it's just it's it it's just<br>i<br>basically i'm saying i don't know where<br>to go what's the direction tourism would<br>take and that's even more impacted by<br>what's happening in ukraine today<br>and the disruption that's going to be do<br>and how that war will unfold and the<br>disruption on tourism more like medium<br>to long term in the terms of<br>restructuring<br>so what is the future of tourism is a<br>very big question<br>next slide please<br>what is science fiction from a<br>theoretical lens perspective<br>well<br>it's fundamentally about<br>you need to explain the future science<br>fiction is so<br>to many people uncertain and unreal it's<br>not going to happen but you it's that<br>what if question from an ontological<br>perspective it's trying to explain<br>something<br>so if science fiction is your story of<br>the future you're asking<br>what would be the circumstances and<br>events that would lead to that so it's<br>not about forecasting the future it's<br>probably saying it's a it's a back cast<br>so fundamentally from a normatology<br>perspective you explain the future what<br>if this could happen<br>so it's it's something where it's about<br>a series of assumptions rather than<br>about strong truthfulness or strong<br>or strong<br>or strong strong amounts of evidence<br>and you know the classical example of<br>that if you've seen the film minority<br>report this was stephen field spielberg<br>when he when he did this film he<br>basically got 20 technologists and<br>futurists together in a room and and<br>said to them basically i i want to know<br>the seeds of the future i want to know<br>about some of the ideas you've got in<br>your laboratory and we could then<br>portray them<br>in minority report again it's this<br>imagination of how it could could happen<br>and basically this book is the minority<br>report book about tourism research<br>and<br>that comes about<br>if you're going to do a book on science<br>fiction or what it what i think right at<br>the heart of it is people<br>have not got to believe you<br>because there's going to be a degree of<br>skepticism or fallacy or falseness in<br>people's understanding of what the<br>future is if people say this can't<br>happen this won't happen your scenarios<br>are actually quite good and that's right<br>at the heart of the principles of what<br>jim didn't say at the university of<br>hawaii if you've got to do a good future<br>set one of your scenarios has got to<br>have a degree of skeptibility of<br>skepticism of what it's all about<br>and<br>we construct science fiction scenarios<br>very much from very weak signals<br>you know very<br>things that are very embryonic very<br>things that are starting in the terms of<br>their smallness next slide please<br>so<br>and uh you know<br>you've got to get ideas from somewhere<br>and leon will go further into this but<br>to me<br>you know i'm a great advocate of science<br>fiction and films you know i like a good<br>disaster movie or a good goody body type<br>of film and one of the films that<br>portrays science fiction very well is<br>westworld not just the new series but<br>the all series with you your brunette<br>you know this is about<br>the robots that sort of become human and<br>they fight and kill people a good<br>massive<br>something about massacre and death<br>and but it's taking technology<br>to the edges but that technology that's<br>in west world has a degree of truth and<br>it it starts with basically rare<br>kurzweil's work on the singularity is<br>here<br>the point in the future when you have<br>one minute when the power of robotics<br>and<br>are there so you know westworld's a<br>really good thing final slide please<br>so my final slide basically says<br>what is that theoretical lens from a<br>theoretic from an ontological<br>perspective<br>from an ontological perspective um<br>science fiction is about you need to<br>explain it how could it happen<br>and and what are the characteristics of<br>science fiction research science fiction<br>has to have is a good story or a<br>narrative<br>it's based on<br>it's based on skepticism<br>it has a degree of liminality in the<br>terms of what's real and what's unreal<br>and it's very blurred<br>science fiction stories are very<br>disruptive but at the same time a sense<br>of<br>transformation<br>and science fiction are also a plurality<br>of futures there's the science fiction<br>world and the real world it's like we're<br>in the cosmos the outer space<br>that different alternative that<br>different alternative more science<br>fiction stories are based upon dystopia<br>with a degree of utopia but you know<br>science fiction is basically you know<br>it's it's around dark tourism death<br>technology the bad side of the bad side<br>of the world but there's also a sense of<br>there's a sense of authenticity about it<br>when you talk to science fiction authors<br>this very much this is going to happen<br>and when you look at<br>so what's happening within the book in<br>the book we fundamentally<br>the book talks a lot about<br>climate change and science fiction<br>and of where that that will go and emily<br>will come on to that and there's a lot<br>about technology<br>and bringing it into today's discourse<br>you can't escape that genre about<br>corvette 19 and pandemics so that's the<br>essence of the book thank you<br>thank you ian<br>and we'll move on then to leon leon<br>you're going to<br>give us a presentation life without<br>limits<br>excellent thank you i'm hoping everyone<br>can hear me fine<br>um<br>next slide please actually let's just<br>jump straight in<br>um so the first thing i kind of wanted<br>to say was apologies for this first<br>slide it's rather gratuitous but um<br>there is a there is a reason that i that<br>i put this this this slide up as the<br>first slide which is there's a scene at<br>the beginning or not the beginning about<br>it's episode six of westworld in which<br>um<br>maeve and android walks through the area<br>where everything is 3d printed uh where<br>she sees the androids that of which she<br>is one of them she sees the androids in<br>the process of being made and she sees<br>you see this scene comes up and it's<br>it's a moment in which actually the the<br>male gaze and i'm thinking of uh the<br>film theorist laura mulvey who talks<br>about male gaze and the ways in which uh<br>female bodies are constructed to be<br>looked at and male bodies are often<br>constructed as as the the<br>the driver of the action the male gaze<br>is subverted in this moment and it's<br>quite interesting because it's a moment<br>where maeve as an android um she becomes<br>um<br>overtly the the driver of the action<br>almost for the rest of the the narrative<br>series and she she loses all her<br>illusions about the kind of world that<br>she's living in all of a sudden um so<br>next slide please<br>and what<br>what's really interesting about this<br>scene for me so this is made here and<br>she she she walks through this this<br>place where she's seeing all the 3d<br>printed androids and she she asks of the<br>human handler that's with her or handler<br>he's kind of terrified of her but his<br>name is felix she says where am i and he<br>says we're in design so they're in the<br>design department<br>and i thought this was a really really<br>interesting moment for kind of<br>laying bare the relationship between<br>both design<br>uh<br>science fiction and the and the notion<br>of tourism as well because this moment<br>where maeve what she does is she walks<br>in to<br>um she is confronted by a full-sized<br>almost kind of cinema screen sized uh uh<br>display and she sees the branded you<br>know packaging for westworld she sees<br>this you know westworld discover your<br>true calling and she even sees herself<br>in the kind of packaged um talk about<br>again to talk about the male gaze in<br>that kind of packaged look at these look<br>at these female sexual objects that you<br>could come and shoot or or<br>to to put it bluntly raped which is what<br>is happening in this in this movie these<br>androids are<br>being um uh abused<br>so<br>the interesting thing about this moment<br>is actually it's it's it for me<br>it's an example for me of the way in<br>which westworld doesn't necessarily take<br>um the idea of a tourist future that's<br>far in advance it actually takes the<br>ideas about tourism futures from where<br>we already are<br>um maeve's sudden shock is kind of the<br>sudden shock of someone suddenly<br>deciding or not suddenly realizing that<br>they're an influencer with 100 million<br>people following them right there's a<br>there's a moment in which she suddenly<br>realizes that she's a packaged consumed<br>object basically um and this isn't this<br>isn't an unusual scene interestingly in<br>popular culture um it's the the first<br>example of this i've tracked in in<br>cinema is actually from 1900 there were<br>two examples one called uncle josh goes<br>to the cinema and then the other one<br>called the countryman and the<br>cinematograph and it's a trope in media<br>theory quite often referred to as the<br>the naive viewer the moment which your<br>viewer is suddenly dispelled of their<br>naivety when they suddenly realize that<br>what their that they understand<br>something new about the world<br>um that they haven't before<br>where you might have seen if any of you<br>have been avid fans of pixar or got<br>children who've been avid fans of pixar<br>is if we go to the next slide<br>is that almost every pixar movie you've<br>ever seen<br>just wait yes almost every pixar movie<br>you've ever seen actually hinges on this<br>moment it hinges on a moment where<br>where the toys realize that they're<br>consumable objects that they are toys<br>that they're not actually um that<br>they're not actually uh uh<br>you know individual human beings in that<br>sense and that the weird fantasy land<br>around them is not um it's not what they<br>thought it was and these are just a few<br>examples i could have given you loads<br>and loads and loads um so what's<br>happening here is maeve sees himself in<br>relation to the branded tourist<br>experience and our consciousness is<br>realized in direct relation to the<br>notion of tourism as a designed<br>experience<br>and she understands herself as a<br>consumable consumed and consumer product<br>and that's when she gets angry you know<br>it's when again when the male gaze is<br>subverted when she suddenly realizes i'm<br>going to take control of this of this<br>future and i'm going to start disrupting<br>uh this this this this tourist future or<br>the tourist present for her<br>um<br>and and so for her to become sentient<br>she has to understand that a world in<br>the<br>place in the world at that moment is not<br>dissimilar to a kind of social media<br>influencer allowing others to consume<br>the the tourist experience there you<br>know via their packaged brand and and in<br>this case she's literally being consumed<br>because she ends up often dead and being<br>resurrected so she's literally uh often<br>consumed to the point of of the end of<br>her life for that for that cycle<br>so<br>as i said her realization is a<br>subversion of the male gaze<br>now i want to jump to the the other<br>really interesting aspect of westworld<br>and i'll come back to this in a minute<br>so if we can just<br>flick onto the next slide<br>so the other the other i think uh really<br>narrative uh<br>the other interesting trope in in<br>westworld for me is a is a harking back<br>to um<br>shakespeare's the tempest actually it's<br>a it's what happens is uh dr john ford<br>who is the um<br>uh no sorry robert fold robert ford who<br>is the anthony hopkins character he he's<br>literally kind of designing the androids<br>he's 3d printing them he writes the code<br>and scripts for both the psychology and<br>the narratives of the hosts right up<br>until he sets them free now in the first<br>episode of westworld peter abernathy<br>actually malfunctions and he states hell<br>is empty and all the devils are here<br>that's a quote from ariel in the<br>shakespeare's the tempest the<br>interesting thing about the tempest is<br>the um the tempest was it was<br>shakespeare's autobiographical uh play<br>and it was a it was the only one that he<br>didn't he didn't pilfer the idea from<br>someone else but he made up entirely<br>himself and on on this island in in the<br>tempest um prospero is just like a<br>playwright directing all of the<br>characters and so there's a direct kind<br>of reference between prospero and uh uh<br>robert ford and also by the way the fact<br>that he's called robert ford it's a nod<br>to john ford the the movie director of<br>westerns<br>um so<br>so what happens here then is that<br>essentially uh dr ford does exactly the<br>same in westworld as as prospero does in<br>the tempest which is he designs the<br>action and he designs the the narrative<br>uh in west world it's interesting<br>there's a deliberate illusion i think<br>between the idea of scripting as in<br>coding and scripting as in an act of<br>theatrical authorship there's a<br>deliberate there's a conversion of both<br>of those things so he scripts their<br>psychologies psychologies and they also<br>have their narrative their words and<br>their phrases written into their their<br>psychologies<br>um next slide please<br>so what what i think westworld is doing<br>is it's it's implying that we we are<br>moving essentially from uh from a<br>humanist world in which uh which was the<br>world that shakespeare was really<br>contending with when he wrote uh<br>the tempest was this world where we'd<br>move from the idea of god uh as being in<br>in power of the the machinations of the<br>world to to humans and at that point to<br>man understanding the kind of narrative<br>uh the the sorry not the narrative the<br>the physical um<br>uh construction of the world how how the<br>world how the laws of physics work<br>basically so we move from kind of<br>theistic to a humanistic uh uh<br>world construction and what i think<br>westworld does is it does it implies the<br>next move along it implies that we're<br>now moving to a post-humanist world and<br>what it suggests in this post-humanist<br>world is that<br>in a world where um people want ai<br>tourist experiences that are not just<br>bound up in a kind of stage managed<br>design simulations of the real but they<br>also often offer new avenues for<br>simulating increasingly unreal<br>experiences with high degrees of ferris<br>similitude in which participants can<br>discover their real souls through the<br>facilitation of safe anarchy and it also<br>suggests that essentially<br>these kinds of tourist futures that<br>would be using ai will inevitably<br>involve software engineering and a<br>command over both narrative and ludology<br>these are terms that are used in game<br>design right so the the world<br>construction and the narrative<br>construction of how the characters<br>behave within the world<br>um it suggests that tourist futures<br>could more closely resemble hybrid<br>services presently found in digital<br>cultural production and design as the<br>line between digitally deployed<br>algorithms and physical algorithms<br>continue to blur further in say ai<br>actors<br>um and it suggests that the kind of<br>coders programmers and designers and<br>game developers could all be employed<br>alongside scriptwriters and designers<br>found in the film industry in actual<br>tourist experiences and i find this<br>interesting because what it's doing is<br>it's projecting forward and saying how<br>might all of these kinds of roles start<br>to blur in tourism futures um next slide<br>please<br>leon<br>great i'm on my final slide so that was<br>that's worked well perfect so um<br>so what can we conclude then here uh<br>i i would say that what westworld<br>suggests is that increasing levels of<br>automation and machine learning will be<br>deployed in the tourist industry because<br>it already is um so it's actually more<br>on extrapolation than it is a kind of<br>wild fantasy westworld doesn't point to<br>where we'll end up so much as where we<br>are already heading um the tourist<br>industries of uh have already gone<br>radical change as a result of networked<br>information and the capacity of<br>automated the automated database and the<br>algorithm to shape flows of tourism<br>flows of tourism seeking out and<br>consuming new experiences<br>and added to this um social media and<br>their distributive power um has been<br>equally if not more powerful than the<br>tourist industry's advertising efforts<br>in in in recent decades<br>um<br>i think the the journey westworld<br>invites us on is a thought experiment to<br>consider what happens to the tourist<br>industry when algorithmic automation<br>continues to undergo as much change over<br>the next couple of decades as it has<br>over the previous decades um and maybe<br>this is me stretching it a bit far maybe<br>this is a bit painful but i was struck<br>by the fact that unreal gaming engine<br>which is no longer it doesn't even brand<br>itself as a game engine anymore unreal<br>engine now brands itself as a real-time<br>engine<br>right so which is so they've dropped the<br>idea of the game because they're saying<br>this is applicable across multiple<br>industries in many many ways and i just<br>thought it was really interesting that<br>the westworld logo and the unreal engine<br>logo were very very similar um and i'll<br>leave you with that small bit of uh uh<br>conspiracy theory that's great leon i<br>shall never look at uh buzz lightyear in<br>the same way again<br>um<br>but anyway thank you so much um<br>folks uh do remember you can raise<br>questions in the q a and<br>when you know as you go along and we can<br>address those at the end we're going to<br>move on to maria down to the destination<br>um good morning or good evening everyone<br>next slide please<br>so destination of the dead identifies a<br>clear comparison between the impact of<br>over tourism and the fictional impact of<br>zombie awards<br>even basic over tourism solutions such<br>as controlled entry are replicated in<br>this<br>genre in the forlorn hope of controlling<br>the horde using a metaphor of tourists<br>zombies<br>it was intended to stimulate debate<br>about the potential overwhelming<br>negative impacts of over tourism if not<br>much managed correctly dresser in 2014<br>argued pop culture can provide critical<br>alternatives to real life issues<br>therefore could over tourism be solved<br>through the zombie genre next slide<br>please<br>so before we get into the sustainability<br>there is a fundamental similarity<br>between tourism and zombies as both<br>causing reversible change and the<br>participants are in the the victim in<br>the case of zombies this idea of the<br>otherness of being as a zombie hungers<br>for brains<br>do we as tourists not hunger for<br>experiences adventures a different way<br>of life from our usual workday existence<br>or even more simply considering the sun<br>town many tourists safe to acquire this<br>is a visible change to the skin of the<br>person now consider how the skin of a<br>zombie victim changes once they have<br>been bitten and become infected and next<br>slide please<br>so<br>this change does not only occur in the<br>human level but also occurs in the<br>economy social and cultural fabric<br>environment of the host destination in<br>terms of environmental impact to sean in<br>2015 wrote about a slow-moving<br>cumbersome ward he wasn't describing<br>tourists in the scenario but rather the<br>undead but as anybody who has been to a<br>popular church destination can testify<br>to the slow-moving cumbersome board<br>could easily be used to describe tourist<br>crowds<br>probably the most obvious example and<br>you'll see there are in scenes from 28<br>days<br>later and the walking dead is the<br>fragile degraded environments that exist<br>in zombie genre and are typically found<br>in areas suffering from over tourism<br>interestingly the makers of the tv<br>version of the walking dead and i create<br>a new zombie series based in new york a<br>city right for over tourism issues<br>and i should note that this new series<br>is to be called isle of the dead and<br>we'll keep an eye on that because the<br>title sounds rather familiar<br>and looking at social and cultural<br>impacts the consumption of brains by a<br>zombie is our main reason for existing<br>similar indeed to the conspicuous<br>consumption by the tourists<br>and in the sort of bottom right hand<br>corner we have the toxoplasma gondii<br>parasite um and this change is typically<br>found in cats and changes the<br>attitude of cats effectively and that<br>makes them<br>more susceptible or<br>more willing to<br>die for want of a better term<br>but is there an unknown force therefore<br>activated by our necessary change in<br>habitat when we become a tourist and the<br>changes are behavior making us more<br>susceptible to dangerous activities or<br>particular activities that we wouldn't<br>normally partake in at home<br>not discussed in the chapter one that<br>does come up time and time again is<br>perhaps enclave tourism and does it is<br>it reflected in some of the things<br>within zombie genre with the local<br>population were placed in zombies as the<br>protagonists in this scenario the<br>defendant communities identified on the<br>walking dead comics and tv show could<br>easily be considered similar to all<br>inclusive resorts that employ gates<br>expenses and other security measures<br>that keep the local population out are<br>in the case of the walking dead to keep<br>the zombies out<br>with regard to economic then it's widely<br>accepted that economic overdependence on<br>tourism leaves regions as significant<br>risk of over<br>tourism one only has to consider iceland<br>and focus on tourism<br>2008. by 2017 then iceland had become so<br>dependent on tourism it was considered<br>to be a serious risk of uber tourism<br>interestingly in the world were said<br>book um it's very much identified that<br>iceland is overrun by zombies and can no<br>longer be visited<br>peter in the original dawn of the dead<br>and this<br>struck me as leon was given his<br>presentation this is a very similar<br>quote<br>peter in the original dawn of the dead<br>suggests that when there's no more room<br>in hell the dead will walk the earth<br>despite previous arguments by beckerman<br>in 1974 for example the negative impacts<br>of massachusetts will be felt in all<br>destinations exclusivity is no longer<br>guaranteed and what was once widely<br>exotic is not very much commonplace next<br>so was george a romero<br>the center the guy there in the center<br>of soul zombies considered to be the<br>godfather of the dead and<br>self-conservative zombie stories are<br>away describing how the world responds<br>to a global issue the unprecedented<br>growth and international tourism like<br>governments and populations is therefore<br>perhaps the ultimate zombie story<br>um i would note that the chapter was<br>written pre-covered<br>and then as we emerge from this pandemic<br>over tourism is not a primary concern<br>for destinations however a level of<br>latent demand in the marketplace would<br>suggest that poor jerusalem may soon<br>raise its ugly head again and it's not a<br>time for destinations to be tackling the<br>issue before it becomes a problem again<br>one potential solution copied from the<br>zombie chamber genre would be to leave<br>honeypot destinations to the tourists<br>and establish local communities<br>elsewhere something similar to the red<br>record plan is discussed in the word<br>warsaw<br>just as the characters and zombie<br>stories cannot escape the relentless<br>words of undead destinations cannot<br>escape the unstoppable march of the<br>tourists and for many destinations this<br>may inevitably lead to over tourism once<br>a zombie horde is released it's very<br>difficult to control just like tourism<br>so brother and under tamara to<br>keep things moving<br>thank you very much mariette<br>yes<br>oh hi<br>you can hear me right<br>yes<br>i'm i'm sending you greetings from the<br>lobby of the hotel android scene i asked<br>the hotel manager to empty the lobby and<br>i said i told the manager like i'm one<br>of the authors of this wonderful<br>inspiring book so yeah so that's why<br>there's no people behind me<br>um<br>so my name is emily heckett and i'm a<br>postdoctoral researcher at the<br>university of lapland in in finland<br>and i have written this chapter<br>with professor martin graham from dinner<br>university in sweden<br>and as<br>many of you might know martin has been<br>doing this pioneering work on on tourism<br>in the underpricing<br>uh well in short and refers to the<br>current epoch where humans interfere<br>with the geological and biological<br>processes of the world to a greater<br>extent<br>and well i want to say also that today<br>martin and i are both part of this<br>research group called<br>intra living in the anthropocene<br>financed by the academy of finland where<br>we explore the potentialities of<br>proximity and tourism<br>and well i could say a little bit about<br>my background is that my previous<br>research has explored<br>especially the ethics of hospitality and<br>ethics of care and how different kind of<br>hosts both human and non-human<br>uh welcome and take care of each other<br>in tourism settings so when our paths<br>crossed when martin and i met<br>we came we began to weave together this<br>fictitive speculative and somewhat<br>apocalyptic story about the hotel<br>anthropocene<br>and<br>i wanted to show you i'm thinking can<br>you see i have this<br>something happening with the lobby here<br>i wanted to no you can't see it how<br>should i do it<br>whatever what i want to show you is that<br>our chapter is written as a script<br>uh so there are all together six<br>different scenes<br>um and now we want to say warm thanks to<br>the editors and also to sarah for<br>encouraging us to<br>to test this kind of<br>experimental writing and it feels like<br>this book is a very good home for for<br>our story<br>um<br>well i do not want to reveal too much<br>about the plotline i'm thinking that<br>when our script is turned into a movie i<br>hope that there are many movie producers<br>uh following the event today<br>um so i think that the movie trailer<br>will most likely present<br>a scene<br>of this big overbooked all-inclusive<br>hotel<br>and there are very like different kind<br>of guests there are people who are<br>traveling under a different kind of<br>premises<br>uh there are tourists who are fleeing<br>their daily routines and<br>responsibilities and then there are also<br>climate refugees that have been forced<br>to flee their homes seek for safety<br>um<br>perhaps the trailer could also so<br>there's there's a screen in this lobby<br>um<br>a screen with a blinking red text<br>that tells that different parts of the<br>hotel system is are actually going down<br>um the trailer could<br>include an image of the infinity pool<br>that has run out of water<br>so<br>no swimming in there<br>there are also this half half empty<br>puffet buffet tables that are upsetting<br>the guests so we're expecting a lot more<br>um<br>however at the same time they're also<br>for most likely people<br>dancing and singing i don't know<br>despacito maybe that would basically<br>everybody knows that uh in the bar i'm<br>trying to ignore the boring signs and<br>also the ever more pressing atmosphere<br>so that i think this would be more or<br>less than what our movie trailer will<br>look like<br>um<br>so not really revealing more uh<br>but i would like to point out that when<br>we were writing the script um<br>we felt<br>uneasy about the characters in our story<br>whose thoughts contradicted them and<br>also contradicted others around them and<br>we discussed quite a lot about this<br>feeling of uneasiness that we were<br>feeling<br>and it's<br>it's it's clear that contemporary<br>tourism is filled with these awkward<br>paradoxes that echo world wheels that<br>are no longer<br>tenable in the midst of environmental<br>crisis well there's a what i mentioned<br>what the trailer would probably also<br>present the inequalities and global<br>mobilities there are climate refugees<br>um and also<br>as we know the current situation<br>people living in their homes for<br>different reasons<br>um then but we still continue to fly for<br>lesser<br>uh although it accelerates climate<br>change there's the phenomenon of last<br>chance to risk for example here in the<br>arctic um<br>you're keen to experience vulnerable<br>landscapes before it's too late<br>and and it seems like we have the needed<br>knowledge knowledge but we choose to act<br>in harmful ways<br>and as the editors point out in the<br>introduction of the book and as ian just<br>described<br>um science fiction enables us to engage<br>with this speculative storytelling and<br>it also enables us to grasp these kind<br>of contradictions awkward paradoxes and<br>contradictions in our own ways of being<br>and knowing and also conducting research<br>so i said i see that instead of trying<br>to hide or overlook this<br>this feelings of uneasiness or<br>contradictions in general or to pretend<br>that we know exactly what is happening<br>and what we should do it enables us to<br>slow down and well what donahue says to<br>stay with the trouble<br>do i still have<br>a few minutes<br>yes yes<br>uh so<br>i see that our chapter is also a small<br>contribution in this larger project of<br>exploring<br>what our research does and how we can<br>engage with different forms of<br>storytelling to speculate and envision<br>different kinds of futures and also to<br>ask the question<br>how these different ways of sharing<br>information and telling stories about<br>the climate crisis<br>biodiversity loss overuse of resources<br>and so on how do these<br>stories and narratives attune us how do<br>they make us feel and how do they make<br>make us act is it possible that they<br>paralyze us<br>and how we are we being moved by<br>different kind of stories and not least<br>how we should as researchers position<br>ourselves in these stories<br>um<br>and our chapter is in the dystopia i can<br>pronounce that dystopia right dystopia<br>section of this book and it definitely<br>belongs there it's an apocalyptic story<br>uh however although we're telling this<br>kind of apocalyptic story we're by no<br>means convinced that this is the way we<br>should engage with the storytelling in<br>the antrophysy so i think it's<br>and i think this is also something we<br>should think about with our teaching<br>that what what it is how does it attune<br>us when we tell this kind of upper body<br>stores<br>so as my final works i want to welcome<br>you to visit our chapter and visit the<br>hotel anthropocene and to critically<br>reflect with us on tourism in the<br>context of planetary ethics<br>and well i also want to mention that at<br>the end of the chapter you can find<br>added this added leaflet companion where<br>we offer further explanation about the<br>meanings of the different scenes and<br>also summarize some of the readings<br>that have been guiding our imaginaries<br>when we'll be writing writing the story<br>so movie producers<br>and others you can get my contact data<br>from the editors thank you<br>thank you emily and we'll certainly keep<br>that in mind when you're up for your<br>your bafta award or or whatever and make<br>sure we get a a<br>a a seat in the front row for that one<br>so that was excellent thank you<br>folks um unfortunately mariana can't be<br>with us this evening but uh ian is going<br>to speak on her behalf for the last uh<br>presentation this evening<br>in<br>um<br>good morning right okay right<br>i'm marianna<br>and i'm the good looking one uh what are<br>you kidding um right i think when we<br>did this book it's<br>it goes back to what i said at the<br>beginning<br>and i think it's the power of science<br>fiction<br>um within the genre of tourism of<br>tourism research and how we see research<br>going at the moment how we see research<br>going at the moment<br>because science fiction to a certain<br>extent is an art<br>and it therefore it's quite a powerful<br>tool to see different things because<br>very much when we doing tourism research<br>we tend to be very much<br>narrowed it's like we're on railway<br>tracks<br>journal articles that are very much<br>accepted in the top tier journals have<br>to be of a certain genre or a certain<br>type<br>and so that you know for example at the<br>moment<br>there's<br>journals like a very quantitative<br>purpose and quantitative purpose from a<br>future<br>can only go into a very short term<br>very short term changes<br>and tourism academics seem to be writing<br>very narrowly and tourism academics seem<br>to be all right<br>very much all writing on the same thing<br>and the way we approach we tend not to<br>look at tourism in different lenses or<br>with or with different hacks<br>so science fiction is an art it's very<br>abstract it allows us to see different<br>things<br>and it empowers us<br>to frame the future very differently<br>very much science fiction because it's<br>unstructured it's uncertain it lets you<br>paint a different canvas of what the<br>future is because many of us as<br>stakeholders are involved in tourism<br>have to take decisions that are<br>politically acceptable<br>we tend not to think about the<br>unacceptable or the unimaginable and the<br>thing with tourism at the future and the<br>future of tourism it's changing it's<br>coming rapidly so for example we<br>explored some of the<br>the ideas that leon's brought up in west<br>world when did they actually come true<br>not explaining them but when do they<br>come true and what's in what it's impact<br>so art is a different thinking tool art<br>is a different cognitive lens for<br>science fiction<br>it tells us different things from<br>different systems perspective and<br>different behaviors so for example<br>if we think of the genre of tourism<br>ethics<br>if we think about what is ethical today<br>it may not be<br>ethical tomorrow<br>something that's ethical today may be<br>unethical in the future and vice versa<br>so even understand the ethics<br>at a very basic level<br>is where we can take science fiction<br>thinking the impossible and thinking out<br>of the box and reshaping boundaries<br>so science fiction is something<br>as it's a narrative<br>it's putting you fundamentally into the<br>role of i or a person it's you if it's<br>you as if you've been transformed<br>you you you're going into this world<br>you're going right into the the center<br>of the book<br>you know<br>you're the person in the hotel emily was<br>talking about you are the person in the<br>harry potter in the harry potter story<br>but um you know you know<br>talks about you are the person that's<br>immersed so you tend to look at things<br>from the first from the person the eye<br>and where it's it's where it's going and<br>what it's what it's doing<br>and again it goes back to science<br>fiction and tourism<br>basically<br>it's what i talk about in terms of its<br>liminality state it's already here but<br>it's a matter of consciousness and how<br>we understand it to many of us we will<br>reject science fiction but anyway but<br>very much many of the elements of<br>science fiction are here for us to<br>explore and that the key one that's<br>happening very quickly at the moment if<br>you just take a look at the theories<br>um<br>or the kits that surround the metaverse<br>the metaverse is this alternative world<br>the metaverse is something where you can<br>visit<br>it's your avatar it's this different<br>world of where we're going in the terms<br>of what you do so you can explore things<br>you because tourism to a certain extent<br>is away from the daily routine<br>of your daily life you go on holiday to<br>do all of the things you can do in your<br>normal life as the same vegas and it<br>happens in vegas it stays in vegas and<br>that's what the metaverse is it's this<br>alternative world with a different<br>identity<br>different games different genre where a<br>different personality that you've got<br>comes out in the terms of doing things<br>so science fiction is a different way to<br>explore the future of tourism<br>thank you uh very much to all our<br>presenters and there's an opportunity<br>now folks to um ask some questions of<br>our panel<br>and but maybe if i could ask a question<br>uh first of all<br>ray bradbury considers<br>science fiction as the most important um<br>literature in the history of the world<br>because it is the history of ideas what<br>are or what are your ideas from science<br>fiction for tourism and the future of<br>tourism<br>and you want to jump in<br>repeat the questionnaire please<br>sure ray bradbury considers science<br>fiction as the most important literature<br>in the history of the world because it<br>is the history of ideas<br>so what are your ideas from science<br>fiction<br>for tourism and the future of tourism<br>i think um<br>that's what that's what the central<br>purpose of the book is you know the<br>central purpose of the book is is full<br>of ideas<br>um<br>and<br>there's a couple of things that resonate<br>from me so for example i i love mariad's<br>chapter on destination of the dead it<br>just it just hit up it just hit a button<br>with me<br>in the terms of i think about all of<br>those tourists that would wander around<br>venice<br>and<br>it's about how it's about seeing venice<br>in two hours<br>it's where we we become engrossed in<br>what we want to see but we don't see it<br>and also<br>to actually tourists when they go on on<br>holiday to a certain extent i've got<br>these things tourists never look<br>tourists never engage because they're on<br>their mobile form and they're engaged<br>with something else they nev they're<br>never switched off<br>so tourists are zombies is the very<br>passive<br>tourist zombies they're very passive<br>they're not in the not immersive and if<br>we look to the future of tourism<br>you know everybody's talking about<br>regenerative tourism where it's a lot<br>more immersive engaging with the<br>destination taking on the<br>characteristics of the destination<br>you're not the tourist but europe you're<br>a temporary temporary resident<br>and to a certain extent mass tourism has<br>been about this<br>wandering around<br>not noticing things and going for going<br>from here to b<br>in the terms of like that so that's what<br>some of the good writings that that are<br>coming out of this and there's another<br>chapter by iana rackenberger which she<br>talks about um<br>harry potter<br>and you know it<br>it harry potter in the way harry potter<br>is a good person<br>harry potter is about um challenging the<br>impossible coming over<br>fight fighting the dragons and fighting<br>evil but coming out the end and to a<br>certain extent<br>that's what tourism is<br>and how it's it's having how<br>having to fight<br>many people see tourism<br>as an evil as something bad in society<br>but actually tourism is for the good of<br>society and it's it's part of the it's<br>part of the solution but not of the<br>problem and we as tourism leaders and<br>tourism stakeholders is about taking<br>that good fight um<br>and the benefits of tourism to many<br>communities so they're the two of the<br>things that resonate from me<br>leon you had some really interesting<br>ideas uh looking at westworld and<br>technology etc um what ideas there do<br>you see um becoming more prevalent in<br>the future as we we i suppose develop<br>experiences uh in tourism<br>well actually i was gonna i was gonna go<br>on i was tempted to to<br>put my hand up there so i'm glad you<br>asked cause uh because it follows on<br>from what ian's just saying actually one<br>of the things i think is really<br>interesting about westworld is<br>um it it it suggests it suggests two<br>things at the same time it suggests an<br>escape which of course tourism has<br>always been an escape right it's always<br>been a it's almost like if you look at<br>it from a depressingly economic unit you<br>you're buying you're buying yourself<br>free time out of the labor market to<br>spend<br>not doing work right but but then at the<br>same time it mixes it with with with the<br>the<br>the actually having to do work so so<br>west was a difficult brutal you know a<br>little bit like going on a really<br>miserable in new zealand in the<br>reigns maybe or you know like it's kind<br>of you it's actually hard in some ways<br>so there's some of it that's hard<br>and i think what's interesting is<br>uh<br>what it suggests is that there's a<br>capacity to leave behind what i think is<br>interesting about west coast is the<br>capacity to leave behind the 21st<br>century actually that that you've got<br>this hyper futuristic ai robots at the<br>same time as you're going into the 18th<br>century you don't have phones you got to<br>leave your phones at the door and i<br>could well imagine that kind of thing<br>that the thing where how do we get<br>people more engaged well construct a<br>situation in which the phone is not<br>available i mean i actually think it's<br>probably one of the reasons why<br>hiking is so popular in new zealand is<br>and every time i go hiking you turn up<br>in hooks and there is a discussion every<br>time about the fact that no one can get<br>phone signal and that's a good thing um<br>and i think there'll be concerns when<br>you finally can get your phone signal<br>wherever you are and then interestingly<br>there was an ian banks uh<br>novel i read years and years ago in<br>which he you know people would go on<br>they would go rock climbing and leave<br>their communicators behind so that there<br>was no way of of being you know and so i<br>think there'll be an aspect of the<br>disconnection as well um which follows<br>on from what ian was saying but of<br>course the very powerful<br>i would say this because i'm you know<br>photographer and visual theorist as well<br>as a designer and i see the tourist gaze<br>as just being so profoundly powerful um<br>how you<br>manage the the need for people on social<br>media to prove that they've been<br>somewhere with the disconnecting from<br>technology i don't know how you manage<br>that but it strikes me that there's<br>multiple competing demands in tourism<br>always probably<br>it's a really interesting point<br>and and<br>um<br>maybe uh maybe looking further and<br>emily uh particularly in that whole area<br>of sustainability and ethics and<br>environmentalism<br>and what's happening um at the moment uh<br>supposed post uh covet where we we have<br>to rethink uh what we were<br>the way we were consuming tourism have<br>you any further thoughts there about uh<br>the way forward in certain destinations<br>it's a good question<br>we're as i mentioned earlier we are now<br>exploring the possibilities of proximity<br>tourism and kind of exploring um<br>the mundane<br>in new ways<br>and<br>i've i've been now when i've been<br>listening to you i've been like thinking<br>like ding ding ding how could we kind of<br>connect the science fiction and with the<br>kind of storytelling with the proxy with<br>the idea of proximity and i think i have<br>to continue<br>uh with that<br>i don't know i think what i i what i i'm<br>taking<br>um<br>beats me like reading this book and i'm<br>thinking it's so important also not only<br>for researchers but also for for<br>students to read it it's kind of this<br>what you said about the speculation and<br>not knowing kind of the humbleness that<br>comes with that<br>that we kind of it's a cliche but we<br>have to work together<br>um but it's kind of it's a good starting<br>point to kind of um<br>and<br>uh very nice and and confessed a bit of<br>not we do not really know uh so it<br>is um<br>so gonna have this open endings so i<br>don't i i think i'm i'm kind of careful<br>i don't think i would like to suggest<br>this<br>uh<br>kind of<br>answers and i don't have any easy<br>answers but i think in general like kind<br>of this open-endedness<br>um<br>kind of fascinates me<br>and i think open-endedness is good<br>because it makes us think and explore so<br>and thank you emily for that and mariad<br>and zombies do do you still think we<br>will need those uh zombie horde<br>techniques um uh in destinations in the<br>near future<br>uh<br>yeah i do i think there is there's<br>billion demand in the market um for<br>tourism so i think uber tourism is still<br>very much an issue that has to be<br>addressed<br>um and even if you were for example<br>going to normandy report in the bahamas<br>this summer you might consider<br>how that would um<br>you know how that is replicated in the<br>zombie genre so actually it always has<br>sort of been there it's just about how<br>you know now that we've identified it<br>and the interest on<br>an important point about that passivism<br>amongst tourists<br>and high then that is replicated in the<br>slowly moving shuffling chambering mode<br>of zombies you can easily imagine a<br>slowly moving shuffling charming board<br>of tourists going through barcelona or<br>venice or any of those sort of<br>destinations that would be synonymous<br>with over tourism so<br>there is always a lesson to be learned<br>from<br>um i suppose not just zombies but in<br>terms of science fiction and that idea<br>that you know by tapping into pop<br>culture whether it is science fiction<br>whatever it may be<br>you can create<br>alternatives creative alternatives to<br>real life issues<br>okay thank you we have one question from<br>our attendees uh from martin martin is<br>saying thinking of one segment of a<br>possible scenario quadrant will tourism<br>exist when the monetary economy no<br>longer exists i.e that the tyranny of<br>tourism will longer be required what<br>replaces tourism wow that's a deep one<br>ian any thoughts on that i can have a<br>goal um<br>just a thing so basically we talk about<br>tourism as a monetary system are we<br>talking about tourism as an economic<br>system<br>tourism without economics means tourism<br>has failed as a business<br>and so all of us are academics um we're<br>all involved in tourism management or<br>tourism business so we would we<br>would be in a world of collapse if you<br>don't have tourism from an economic<br>system<br>tourism does not does not exist because<br>there is a monetary value with it for<br>businesses to be in business with<br>i think the important question that<br>martin raises is how do we view tourism<br>and to me it's what the value of tourism<br>is because tourism is more than<br>economics<br>it's its value in the terms of human<br>capital social capital and and tourism<br>and its relationships to technology so<br>looking at the value of system<br>and because fundamentally we measure<br>tourism from an economic perspective<br>and i think there has to be a strong<br>movement to move tourism<br>tourism out of that system in the terms<br>of its measurement and its success and<br>its impact and it has to be against<br>against other criteria and how we<br>understand tourism and how we discuss<br>terrorism but economics is one of the<br>criterias that will not disappear<br>because otherwise there will not be any<br>business for tourism<br>and if you don't have the business of<br>tourism you don't have tourism<br>employment and many destinations that<br>and martin has come back and he said<br>it's one quadrant the future of tourism<br>could be multidisciplinary and its<br>survival is beyond economics definitely<br>thank you so<br>that's that's uh good thoughts there<br>folks<br>um<br>if i could ask it maybe one last<br>question to get you to to reflect folks<br>and if you were to write your chapters<br>again<br>um<br>and where we are at the moment what<br>um is it this is for edition number two<br>by the way what would you change and<br>what would you add<br>i was i was i mean i i don't know if i'd<br>change or add anything which is going to<br>sound incredibly arrogant but i did<br>really want to jump in on the last<br>question so<br>um<br>can i can i just quickly say about the<br>just in in addition to what ian asked<br>about the<br>ian said about the whether tourism<br>exists or not there's a lot of there's a<br>number of science fiction writers i'm<br>thinking kim stanley robinson and ian<br>banks both write about what what happens<br>in a world where<br>peop the monetary system is no longer<br>necessarily uh functional but people<br>still move around there's still the idea<br>that they move around and they're still<br>and i think people will always want to<br>move around because as we as any<br>paleontologist will tell you we've<br>fundamentally been a migratory species<br>for for a long long time so i i think i<br>think if you if you look at tourism as<br>an economic function then yes but um i<br>can't imagine people not continuing to<br>want to move around and to experience<br>other cultures and um it will be that<br>would be a form of tourism in one way or<br>another and and and the the again<br>i always find myself going back to what<br>we've already got right now<br>and what we've got right now is i've got<br>a whole load of friends who are in the<br>tech industry in the on the west coast<br>of america and they're often not in no<br>longer in the west coast of america<br>they're they're working all over the<br>world um and it's a form of tourism<br>while they work um you know if you if<br>you're living in sri lanka or bali or<br>whatever while you while you're sending<br>your code back to san francisco<br>that's that's still a form of tourism<br>while you're working so i would say<br>the boundaries would potentially just<br>continue to shift on what it is anyway<br>that's me spent my time so shut up<br>good<br>thanks leon<br>maria danny thoughts<br>yeah i think i'll actually probably make<br>mine wider than just zombies and maybe<br>look at it from the entire horror genre<br>maybe a book an entire book itself i<br>made a throwaway comment in the chapter<br>about how you could look at vampire<br>based um<br>the genre of vampires and why they<br>replicate to thing in particular lost<br>voice that<br>tagline party all night sleep all day<br>and whatever the new zealand equivalent<br>of the bethan would be for young people<br>where they would go on holidays and<br>party all night sleep all day they've<br>actually effectively become vampire<br>tourists and the other one i really<br>would want to write about is boss<br>and i use this and it's my first years<br>because if you look at jaws<br>and sustainability you know you have the<br>economic and the economic argument for<br>keeping the beaches open from the mirror<br>and the towns picked the business people<br>in the time<br>regardless of you know the impact on the<br>social cultural that there's potentially<br>some of your population are going to be<br>eaten<br>and then you have that environmental you<br>know the shark is simply doing what a<br>shark does and it just happens to<br>coincide with the holiday destination<br>and even then if you really are getting<br>into it you look at alien and with one's<br>base can you hear your scream you know<br>as richard brown and some of those<br>others began to go up into<br>space are we then you know you're in<br>space tourism and that opens a whole<br>another book for sure in on space<br>tourism and the future of it<br>um<br>so i think yeah i would probably get it<br>from a wider or point of view<br>okay thank you<br>and emily would you add anything to your<br>chapter<br>um i don't know if i would have to ask<br>martin also<br>i think we could have continued to<br>re-rewrite it but i think now when we<br>read it uh we read it that's ready first<br>and i think we were pretty happy with it<br>i don't know if<br>hopefully that outside reader also that<br>we're able to kind of welcome the reader<br>to the story<br>um<br>but i i think i would but this was a<br>kind of it was an<br>experiment which was surprisingly scary<br>or kind of that it is it was so it was<br>really really nice to write<br>this different kind of text<br>and i think i would like to continue<br>with it but and i<br>uh i think you're yes i don't know how<br>to how to<br>explain it more but i think we were kind<br>of uncertain what we were actually doing<br>uh so i i'm i'm happy i hope there's<br>gonna be the the next book also<br>uh<br>like also<br>the about the<br>uh what the kind of the definition how<br>we understand tourism i'd like to<br>go back to that a little bit you you you<br>mentioned you editors uh the<br>traveling in time and and and maybe like<br>kind of what what we how we understand<br>that we understand like<br>uh tourism so much in terms of um<br>physical mobility and then what it will<br>be like this on like micro movements on<br>the logical shifts or<br>uh<br>kind of thinking about time traveling<br>kind of what happens here among us<br>closer to us and i think there is<br>something i think we<br>also need to be ready to kind of disrupt<br>the<br>a little bit more the definition of<br>tourism but we understand what the risk<br>means and i think we're also forced to<br>do that in the in the future<br>brilliant thank you and ian last comment<br>briefly from you um if i was to do the<br>book all over again and actually we've<br>been thinking about ideas and what we<br>should do<br>one of the things i'd probably talk<br>about is weak signals i'd probably do<br>something on technology that hasn't been<br>invented yet but it has been invented<br>yes<br>and the characteristic of that is it's<br>technology that hasn't become mainstream<br>and where we get those ideas for example<br>we would look at paintings so for<br>example<br>uh the digi the digital camera the first<br>painting by kodak was in 19 1972 1972<br>but it didn't come to fruition<br>until the 1990s and what we got so<br>if you look at paintings<br>um i can wear the animal what they do<br>and how far you take them so i probably<br>have some sort of um<br>i probably have some sort of chapter on<br>terminator and arnold schwarzenegger and<br>would relate it back to the work of<br>boston dynamics and what they're doing<br>with with military robots<br>and where they are today and what they<br>would be like in 50 years time would be<br>something very different so that that<br>terminator arnie our arnie fulham um<br>would probably be me<br>i can see you as arnie yes indeed<br>anyway folks and it's time now to bring<br>the session to a close i think you'll<br>agree with rick sports some of the<br>diversity and the creativity of science<br>fiction and<br>given that present context of covert 19<br>more ukraine the disruptive effects of<br>technology i think we can certainly see<br>how science fiction has aspects of<br>truthfulness in it so huge thanks to our<br>fantastic speakers this evening to ian<br>leon maria and emily and to all our<br>wonderful contributors and to the book<br>itself and you'll see them listed on the<br>slide uh thanks also to
