Lecture. <br><br>In this inaugural lecture, Professor Anna Wilkinson will introduce you to the world of animal cognition, showing evidence of the remarkable cognitive abilities of animals, especially those that we don’t normally think of as ‘clever’.  <br><br>She will explore this from a variety of perspectives, from the evolutionary underpinnings of cognitive abilities to the practical use of animal cognition to solve real-world problems.<br><br>lias.lincoln.ac.uk/inaugural-lectures/</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

think our<br>announcement<br>lecture of the series where you have<br>professor anna wilkinson who's going to<br>talk about the secret mind<br>minds of animals um i'm just distracted<br>by the star of the show<br>so um yes<br>welcome again to the inaugural lecture<br>series uh i did have a couple of<br>announcements before you get to the good<br>stuff so um if there is a fire alarm of<br>which one are planned then there are<br>exits at the rear<br>um and we hope that you will join us for<br>the talk about 45 minutes to an hour<br>a little bit of<br>time and i hope you can join us for<br>refreshments<br>to celebrate what is really<br>quite an amazing thing we have these<br>inaudibles to celebrate our professors<br>um<br>the work they've done the journey<br>they've had and the impact they've been<br>able to make through their research so i<br>will stop uh going on and i will allow<br>professor lily john who's the pro vice<br>chancellor of the college of science<br>to introduce it's a very convoluted<br>thank you stuart<br>so uh oura and i it's a great privilege<br>to introduce anna<br>she was one of the first people i met<br>when i arrived at the university of<br>lincoln back in 2010<br>she had just started at the university a<br>couple of months before me<br>and since then it's been a real<br>privilege to<br>collaborate<br>with lana on various projects and to<br>have her as a colleague<br>but of course anna's career didn't start<br>in 2010 that's just when i got to know<br>her before that she was an undergraduate<br>at the university of stirling uh and<br>took her phd at the university of york<br>which she completed in 2008<br>and followed that with a ph postdoc in<br>the<br>austrian science foundation<br>as you will find out anna is a great<br>speaker much in demand around the world<br>at conferences and events<br>um but more importantly perhaps for us<br>today she's a brilliant scientist who<br>today will really make you think about<br>animal minds uh in a different way than<br>you have before<br>and i'm really delighted that you're all<br>here to uh<br>so thank you all so much for coming i<br>really do appreciate it i have to say<br>this is the talk that has made me more<br>nervous than any talk in many many years<br>because it's not just about my work it's<br>also very personal so i'm thrilled to<br>share it with you today<br>see<br>i'm interested in how animals think so<br>i'm interested in how animals produce<br>information<br>how they remember that and how impact<br>decisions that they make so a lot of<br>what i'm going to be talking about today<br>is looking at that from various<br>different angles<br>so just to give you a little bit of a<br>definition before we start because<br>obviously as a scientist i'd like you to<br>know precisely what it is that i mean<br>but when we're thinking about um<br>commission it's a time referring to the<br>sort of mental processes involved in<br>gaining knowledge so this could be<br>perceiving learning decision making<br>remembering and problem solving so when<br>i say<br>this is what i mean when um when i am<br>talking about it<br>and so why would we study cognition in<br>animals why is it important<br>well in order to understand the<br>evolution of the brain we have to<br>compare cognitive abilities<br>across species<br>is based on the intelligence of that<br>species so if we don't think that these<br>animals are intelligent if we don't<br>think they can process information and<br>remember things we might potentially<br>keep them in ways which are not the most<br>appropriate for them<br>and so in my talk today<br>what i'm hoping to tell you about is i'm<br>going to tell you about the influences<br>that i've had in my career as i've gone<br>along<br>i'll be talking about one of my key<br>research areas called bloody cognition<br>which is why my sister told us is here<br>to join you you'll be hearing more about<br>him um later<br>and then i have to talk about my work in<br>rental welfare so how we take what we<br>know about their coordination and<br>translated this into our understanding<br>of their needs<br>and then finally i'll be talking about<br>some applications of animal condition so<br>not just how it's interesting from a<br>theoretical perspective but how we can<br>actually apply what we know about animal<br>provision to help us to solve real world<br>challenges<br>so<br>i always knew that i wanted to work with<br>animals so ever since i was very little<br>i've been fascinated by animals and in<br>particular pandas were my very favorite<br>this is still my favorite thing in the<br>world<br>and my parents who are just sitting over<br>there are incredibly supportive of me<br>they couldn't have supported my career<br>better however i would say i think i<br>spent the time about eight years old<br>telling people i've wanted to be a panda<br>when i grew up and he never told me i<br>couldn't be so it was a little bit of a<br>blow when uh when i finally found out<br>that um that i couldn't be a panda but<br>um you can't study pandas but also<br>haven't done that either<br>for something to aspire to i think for<br>the future<br>see and<br>in my early days in my school this is a<br>picture of our first year class um you<br>can see one of his friends paul who's<br>sitting over there between my parents<br>he's also in this picture age 11<br>and i wanted to sort of talk about my<br>school because this had a huge influence<br>over the choices that i made so we<br>actually have the<br>oldest natural history society in the uk<br>in a school<br>and michael's martin because his<br>children also went to my school<br>and um<br>and that approach to studying that<br>questioning that we were always<br>encouraged to do to school at school is<br>something which has been incredibly<br>fundamental to my science career we were<br>taught if you have a question you should<br>ask it we were taught there's not a<br>hierarchy that you can't ask the<br>headmaster this if you have a question<br>do so and i think that's something which<br>is fundamentally important and actually<br>i was told that<br>people who then go into sixth form<br>elsewhere they could always tell the<br>people in the school scholars because<br>and also the friendships that i made<br>there have really hugely shaped my life<br>so um i have fantastic friends who have<br>helped me and supported me throughout<br>that career and here are a few of them<br>up here they are all here or watching<br>except frasier he's in the top right<br>hand corner who is currently in<br>whistler's feeling and felt that that's<br>however when we were younger i knew i<br>wanted to spoke animals<br>but i didn't know what it was<br>of about it<br>i thought you could be a vet because i'm<br>actually allergic to animals which is<br>okay<br>um<br>how can you work with animals still how<br>can you how can you do that and actually<br>as i went on through my career i<br>realized that actually being if i was a<br>total nightmare<br>the animals hate that<br>all they do is they associate them with<br>potentially bad things happening<br>and um i worked in the zoo for a little<br>while and you can always tell when they<br>said that they walked into the zoo<br>because the timber of these stuff was<br>screaming<br>max arrived<br>so actually the fact that i couldn't be<br>in that is something which i'm really<br>pleased about<br>yeah<br>so when i was younger we um<br>we lived in<br>asia for a while and it was i was<br>incredibly fortunate that i got to go<br>travel a lot around asia and where you<br>see some phenomenal things but the thing<br>which shaped me absolutely hugely was um<br>about i was about 15 probably<br>i'm watching the orangutans<br>in the wild<br>navigating through the forest<br>interacting with each other interacting<br>show me that what i wanted to do was not<br>just work with animals i wanted to study<br>their behavior and understand what it<br>was they were doing and why they were<br>doing that<br>to try<br>and help with their motivation and this<br>is something that<br>i realized that there were jobs that you<br>could do this sort of thing well there<br>was a way to work with animals in<br>so for my undergraduate degree<br>i went to the university of sterling and<br>i studied psychology the science<br>scientific study of mind and behavior<br>there's lots of psychologists in this<br>um and what's fantastic about studying<br>is there's a huge specialism in animal<br>behaviour within your department and<br>particularly in primatology and at that<br>point i wanted to be in the forest of<br>audio studying around sands or givens<br>okay and<br>so we got an absolute wealth of<br>knowledge on our animal behavior i also<br>learned a lot about human behavior too<br>and um we've had many discussions about<br>little photos of my friends to put up<br>here we decided we said this reflected<br>our university experience i'm not quite<br>sure of it but<br>but it certainly was part of it and<br>these friends people who've been<br>supporting me throughout my whole time<br>since and one of them's here i've also<br>collaborated with the husband of one of<br>them and we have we're working on a<br>paper together so it just shows how the<br>people you meet and how you work<br>together influence what it is you're<br>doing<br>i also met you my partner clemson<br>and so um<br>after university i absolutely wanted to<br>work in the field studying primate<br>behavior<br>and i was really fortunate to do an<br>internship with some andrews and to get<br>to go to cali eye national park which is<br>a glorious national park<br>a very long-term study site to study the<br>behavior of given so it's been tracked<br>at that time 30 years probably now more<br>like 50 years<br>so they have a huge data set for that i<br>was studying alarm call behavior in the<br>givens so i was looking to see if there<br>were specific examples for um different<br>sorts of predators and responses to that<br>now working in canada was both brilliant<br>and really really challenging<br>so first of all in six months there i<br>heard two alarms<br>do you think you needed a lot of data to<br>get a phd<br>i thought is this<br>is this the right thing for me and also<br>after the uncle you think<br>there are times here<br>and what it made me realize<br>was that<br>actually just being in the field and<br>watching animals<br>wasn't what i wanted to do<br>what i wanted to do is i wanted to<br>understand how different things impacted<br>them so i liked the sort of experimental<br>approach where you could say if<br>the animals receive this what do they<br>then do and that was hugely important<br>for me because before this i would have<br>told you for years and years and years i<br>want to be in the forest and want to<br>study primary behavior and by doing that<br>and having that opportunity<br>it made me realize that it wasn't what i<br>but again again this is the story of<br>people and when i was in kelly i met<br>innis who is now an academic at<br>sponsoring and again we have recently<br>collaborated with each other looking at<br>different aspects of hormones and<br>cognition because that's her expertise<br>so all of these different experiences<br>influence what you then<br>go on to do<br>but prior to<br>my time in thailand i actually done um<br>some summer internship at the university<br>of york york is where i'm from<br>and i work with two brilliant academics<br>and they don't talk to me about you know<br>what about poland we could work with<br>pigeons i spent all summer doing this<br>work and i said no no i need to study<br>primates in the wild this is what i want<br>to do but actually<br>i spent an awful lot of my time in<br>thailand thinking about witches<br>actually pictures are just magnificent<br>and i was very fortunate that when i<br>came back from thailand i had the<br>opportunity to do some phd research<br>with<br>our time dr kim kirkpatrick and<br>professor kim kirkpatrick and we did<br>some what i think was really exciting<br>work looking at motion perception and<br>how animals track and capture different<br>objects and how the manipulation of<br>those objects impact the way they<br>perceive<br>and this was the best possible<br>introduction to research that i could<br>have had<br>so kim is a phenomenal role model both<br>as a scientist and as a person<br>and she shared her lovely with jeff hall<br>who's another professor i've worked with<br>a little bit about him shortly and the<br>environment that they both produced was<br>incredibly exciting it was one way you<br>were comfortable<br>then you could ask questions you would<br>comfortable<br>understand<br>but you were always challenged to think<br>more and to be more and that was a<br>really incredible<br>environment for me<br>but you know<br>phds are<br>challenging<br>i remember<br>there are times when anyone who's done a<br>phd they would say they were struggling<br>i remember a time talking to my flatmate<br>she's she was an accountant she was like<br>let's go for dinner so i can't go out<br>for dinner i have no money<br>no i can't do this and then i said no<br>gone down every day i work in academia i<br>want to come to work i want to see what<br>is happening i think that's a hugely<br>important thing<br>to remember<br>and as i said phd's are challenging and<br>when i say to my phd students as much as<br>resilience as they are accustomed<br>intelligence<br>because it's about persevering it's<br>about keeping going<br>and i feel that my early life really as<br>a york city fan really prepares me<br>for it<br>just to give you some of some um facts<br>about your city that they are um<br>the worst professional team in europe at<br>the moment<br>we have a manager who managed to get<br>both us and another team renovated in<br>the same season<br>so these are the sorts of challenges<br>that we're working with and so i felt<br>that that prepared me beautifully but of<br>course we know that resilience is very<br>important so obviously<br>we need to feel this in my son as well<br>i'm sorry<br>he's not wearing his york city shirt<br>today but we're also trying to try to<br>boy that's<br>you see once i was working at york<br>i was um in a lecture so we did a i did<br>quite a lot of teaching in york and i<br>took tutorials so i was going to the<br>lectures so i knew what the students<br>would visit for and then we could build<br>on that in the tutorials and i was in a<br>lecture<br>by jeff wall and he was talking about<br>rats in nature so this is classic<br>learning um<br>well<br>and he was explaining how rats learned<br>to navigate around the maze<br>and um and how they do so<br>and after the lecture i said to my<br>suggestion<br>you know moses could do that<br>and he said oh<br>should we build in the maze<br>and i said yes let's build him a maze<br>and say<br>that is what started<br>my career in the area that i'm now best<br>known as a scientist so this is moses<br>here he's now having a little bit of a<br>chill out he's having a sniff down here<br>he'll come out later if anyone wants to<br>see him at the end you're welcome to<br>come down and you can come and talk to<br>him<br>and so what we did is we got<br>undergraduate students<br>we looked at spatial learning<br>importances<br>we build raises a radial arm ways and<br>the way these lasers work is you put the<br>animal in the center and there's food<br>hidden at the end of each arm there's<br>like a bright spot they can go in they<br>can go out and the question is do they<br>now this is slightly speeded up<br>so this child actually didn't take um 28<br>minutes<br>but what you can see is moving around<br>the maze<br>and he's visiting novel arts<br>okay<br>there are some repeats when he goes back<br>to answer he's going to but in general<br>we found that he was<br>we then followed this up with another<br>project<br>and we found that he actually did so<br>sometimes in similar ways to how you see<br>in mammals but also we use different<br>behaviors as well we haven't really seen<br>and so we've got two cubesats we've<br>found that this can navigate<br>around a complex mate actually this is<br>theoretically really important as well<br>because the way mammals navigate around<br>these lasers they use air in the brain<br>called the hippocampus<br>now reptiles don't have that great area<br>it's been suggested that other brain<br>areas may work in a similar way but<br>nobody ever tested it so by testing this<br>in using methods which are directly<br>comparable with what we've known the<br>mountain birds they can start to inform<br>us about the processes taking place<br>so<br>after i finished my phd i was very<br>fortunate<br>to go to the university of vienna to do<br>a post-doc with um with ludwig hoover<br>pictured with some tortoises<br>and<br>what was so exciting<br>to<br>they had their own species that they<br>worked with and they tested them and<br>then a different lab would maybe use a<br>different species but what they did is<br>he took lots of different species and he<br>compared them in the same way and that<br>was really revolutionary at that point<br>and so to be able to go there and work<br>in a lab like that was incredibly<br>exciting<br>and i was there and i worked with um<br>green pigeons again looking out visual<br>processing and particularly interesting<br>categorization so how<br>animals lump information together they<br>don't have to remember everything<br>they've ever been exposed to but they<br>can still respond to it appropriately<br>how we use this um this is<br>a really important area of visual<br>perception i decided to be really well<br>understood in pigeons i was working<br>in that sort of field<br>but i also presented the thing with my<br>courses work that we've been doing<br>and<br>the thing being literally said<br>what do you need<br>and i went really<br>and i said well i need space<br>i need more animals i need this and<br>literally allowed me to do that he<br>provided me with space he provided me<br>with all more animals<br>and what's even more incredible about<br>that is when i<br>went on and i left vienna he let me take<br>all of that with me and that is truly<br>remarkable so thank you luffy<br>but what did you like well i had a phd<br>student in vienna called you<br>and she really extended our maze work<br>hugely so we have a much better<br>understanding of how the animals are<br>navigating around that maze what<br>mechanisms that they were using and<br>whether we have simply a noticeable<br>effect of one simple strange thought or<br>whether this is something you generally<br>see in red-footed tortoise tortoises but<br>also in reptiles and that's where we<br>found<br>my time in vienna was incredibly<br>inspiring um<br>living has a really huge research group<br>and it was a really exciting environment<br>to be part of people are very open<br>people want to collaborate<br>and also<br>in vienna because of the system that you<br>have there you have very senior postdocs<br>as well whereas we would have lecturers<br>there you have postdocs and so it gave<br>me an awful lot of responsibility very<br>early on and that's something which i'm<br>hugely grateful for because it did it<br>allowed me to create my lab in a way i<br>see<br>the story of my early career is really<br>the story of the<br>support and inspiration i've had from<br>these three people<br>so um kim is a fantastic scientist she's<br>also a brilliant mom and she showed me<br>that you can balance these things in<br>your mind and that's something which has<br>been truly important to me<br>jeff well jeff doesn't like any<br>sentimentality so i'm just going to say<br>to jeff cheers<br>and i think the support and generosity<br>you've given me has just been truly<br>amazing and i can't thank all three of<br>you enough<br>but after finishing my postdoc i<br>couldn't say it in vienna forever so<br>after finishing my pistol i was looking<br>for permanent positions i wanted to have<br>a relationship<br>and my partner ewan he said to me he's<br>very supportive i'm incredibly lucky<br>he's a screenwriter so he can move with<br>me but also he's willing to move with me<br>and that's something that is fantastic<br>um and he said to me i'll go anywhere in<br>the world<br>but if we can afford a garden i want to<br>talk<br>i think that's fairly reasonable<br>and so in fact i ended up here i was<br>originally part of biological sciences<br>at the beautiful albert rice home campus<br>and when i first started i'm very lucky<br>linda took a chance on me so i was<br>employed to teach my masters of killing<br>animal behavior with a big focus on um<br>destinated animals but most of my<br>experience wasn't in that and so the<br>initially i came to lincoln it's a huge<br>learning curve as well and i have to<br>acknowledge daniel and helen and their<br>fantastic support and influence that<br>they have given to me and you'll see how<br>their expertise has influenced me as we<br>go on so these guys are both experts in<br>domestic animal behavior in particular<br>um in particular with dogs and they're<br>interested in applied aspects of animal<br>behavior so how do we improve those<br>animals lives how do we support those<br>animals so they can cope with the<br>challenges they face in the human world<br>and so this was actually incredibly<br>useful because<br>i didn't just<br>even got two dogs<br>and of course because of this influence<br>because i think starting to think of<br>different ways through talking and<br>working with daniel and helen<br>the dog's got her to work straight away<br>so after about um<br>i guess five years probably based at<br>writing and we stopped being biological<br>services we became life sciences and we<br>moved to our very swiss<br>new building um<br>in brayford so this is field of facts<br>laboratories where we're all based now<br>and this is against the house which is<br>the one which truly has my heart because<br>this is where um my animals live and<br>this is where we do our animal behavior<br>research<br>now when we opened joseph banks<br>laboratories libby and i were having a<br>chat and we're thinking what could we do<br>how do we make it interesting and of<br>course<br>first of all let's all just open it<br>so this is i'm hoping if it works<br>charles darwin taught us libby's taught<br>us charles darwin<br>supporting chris pattern and leading<br>this pattern<br>i thought that wasn't me when you did<br>that<br>i was talking a lot this is a new video<br>um but he was he was remarkable actually<br>that video has gone viral a lot and i<br>think a couple of months ago it got went<br>wild against 12 million times<br>which is absolutely incredible but<br>despite<br>his key role<br>in this opening<br>look who gets the credit saying today is<br>the start of the campaign for the<br>tortoises to be acknowledged officially<br>which i've been interested in how it<br>shaped my work<br>what i want to do now is tell you a<br>little bit more detail about some of my<br>research i'll tell you about some of my<br>earlier work first but i also want to<br>show you how working at lincoln and<br>working in a life science department has<br>really changed the way i think as a<br>psychologist<br>see<br>i was very fortunate to start my career<br>studying reptiles when i did so reptiles<br>were basically at that point<br>considered to be sluggish inert and<br>unresponsive and that's actually a<br>direct quote from the paper<br>okay they were thought to be stupid in<br>all intents and purposes unable to learn<br>and this is because scientists have<br>taken tropical animals and put them in<br>cold rooms and funnily enough they<br>didn't do very much<br>but what i wanted to just show you today<br>to get a little glimmer of some of the<br>work that i've done and show you what<br>remarkable abilities these animals have<br>as i've told you from an evolutionary<br>perspective<br>it's really important to study reptiles<br>as the third amniotic branch to<br>understand<br>how different abilities evolved within<br>and the first piece of work i wanted to<br>tell you about um briefly is which<br>extends from the spatial learning world<br>with the maze that we did with moses<br>and what we found we found that when<br>moses was um had access to lots of<br>different cues in a room<br>like he was doing his maze today there's<br>lots of things going on in the room<br>he used those visual cues<br>however when those visual cues were<br>diminished something put me curtain<br>around him what he did was he learned a<br>sort of response based strategy so he<br>learned to go into the arm next before<br>he left which is actually incredibly<br>efficient he's going to get loads of<br>food and it's very light on the memory<br>so actually this is something which is<br>potentially<br>quite a good strategy not a cognitive<br>strategy necessarily but a good strategy<br>for solving it and we want to look at<br>okay if you are making<br>that sort of choice so you're learning<br>just a left choice or a right choice<br>what is it that you're actually learning<br>about so what we did was we actually<br>take our forces to use a touchscreen<br>okay<br>we train them that if they catch that<br>red triangle<br>they would then get two blue circles and<br>i told the saturn just learned to either<br>go left or to learn to go right okay<br>and this is what the tortoises did<br>this is me<br>and you can see she's a left tortoise<br>and they let us do this actually<br>personal dogs do<br>so i i used exactly that touchscreen<br>with dogs and actually taught us do you<br>learn to do this<br>much much faster<br>we've got to see what it was that esme<br>had learned about<br>so had she learned<br>about<br>going left foot or had she just learned<br>a specific response in that context<br>so what we did was we took it to be<br>almost like a map this is a map<br>and then we put her in the arena<br>where there was a red triangle and then<br>two blue food balls and would the<br>tortoises go to the side that they'd<br>previously been rewarded in the<br>touchscreen<br>i always found that they did<br>they're able to generalize their<br>learning<br>from one context to another very very<br>different context when they need to<br>travel through space<br>we then gave them what we call a<br>reversal so if you are a left tortoise<br>in the arena<br>we then train that they have to go to<br>the right<br>and we trained them to do this and then<br>we put them back in the touch screen and<br>said okay so which side are you going to<br>choose now<br>and what we found since they did learn<br>to right<br>and then when we put them back on you<br>they actually used the site and<br>responded highly significantly to the<br>site that they had previously been<br>trained up in the touchscreen so we've<br>shown that they can generalize their<br>learning when they don't want<br>information<br>but if they do have information in an<br>environment they will use that<br>and also because this experiment took<br>quite a long time to do we're actually<br>showing everyone some long-term memory<br>from these guys as well because by the<br>time they were back in the touchscreen<br>was about three months later<br>so we've got evidence they can<br>generalize across context which is<br>something quite remarkable and we found<br>that they can remember this for a long<br>is their social cues<br>so<br>using social cues something which is<br>thought to be cognitively extremely<br>advanced<br>and um we wanted to look at whether they<br>could use a social cue<br>and if they can could they then learn<br>from it so what we did was we gave our<br>courses a gay scaling task and what that<br>is it's very simple<br>if i look up you have this weird urge to<br>look up as well<br>okay<br>or if i'm talking to you and i look over<br>your shoulder you want to look around<br>okay nice please following so you'll<br>find the gaze of another individual and<br>this is something which was thought to<br>be um<br>incredibly accomplished of the offense<br>and it's something which for a long time<br>they thought was only present in<br>primates<br>however if you think about how adaptive<br>it is it's going to alert you to<br>relevant things in nature such as food<br>such as predators it would make sense if<br>many species were able to do this so we<br>tested this in twitter's<br>and what we had was we had a<br>demonstrator on the left<br>we would flash a laser pointer and she<br>would look up the question is what does<br>this other daughters do this taurus<br>couldn't see the laser pointer<br>we have various controls or we flashed<br>the laser points and there was no other<br>tortoise there just to check that um or<br>just to check whether they just<br>generally looked up anyway and what we<br>found was we found that actually<br>in the gays following condition the<br>tortoises looked up about 70<br>of the time whereas in the other<br>conditions the controls which we had<br>they didn't look up very much at all so<br>it tells us that forces can and do<br>we then want to look whether they're<br>actually able to learn from observing<br>the behavior<br>of another individual<br>so this is a social learning task<br>and um this was some of these fabulous<br>scientists i didn't<br>i did i didn't say anything about the<br>previous sciences they were also<br>fabulous um<br>and what we did in the social learning<br>test was this so we had gave our courses<br>so they had a v-shaped fence the<br>tortoise started on the outside<br>and then there was food on the inside so<br>they had to walk around to get food now<br>we had two different groups we had one<br>group of tortoises that just got the<br>opportunity to do this<br>and we looked to see how good they were<br>and how rapidly they could do it<br>and then we had another group of<br>tortoises they've got to watch another<br>taught us complete that detour first and<br>then see if they are then<br>able to do it<br>i apologize for the quality of this<br>video so we have i taught it in there<br>she's been released<br>and she spent a lot of time pushing<br>against the fence to try and get the<br>food<br>so in this<br>control condition where they have to be<br>able to do it themselves not a single<br>animal<br>completed it<br>we then trained one of the tortoises to<br>make the detours so they could be our<br>demonstrator and that took about six<br>weeks<br>at this point we did all the war<br>a on earth<br>and a really really stupid idea in<br>general however what i'm going to show<br>you now is the first pile of one of<br>those tortoises<br>oh no oh no that's not what i'm showing<br>okay so what you'll see<br>this is our demonstrator so you can see<br>up here she does a beautiful detour<br>and then the question is what does this<br>tortoise do this is<br>and you spend a little bit of time<br>pushing against the fence<br>and then he goes around hooray<br>it was very exciting<br>afterwards um<br>and<br>they were all able to do that<br>it was quite remarkable so<br>this is our data this is the success<br>of our modern server group our control<br>group<br>and then this<br>is the success<br>of our experimental group so the group<br>which got to see the other tortoises<br>actually make the detour<br>as well we showed you guys that<br>tortoises were able to access an<br>otherwise inaccessible goal<br>and<br>after observing the behavior of a con<br>specific and this provides a shortcut to<br>new information<br>and this is something that people never<br>thought that a reptile would be capable<br>of doing<br>and the fact that they encountered it<br>actually is theoretically really<br>exciting<br>we've since extended this work to look<br>at actually how do they do this and we<br>looked at imitation which is thought to<br>be the most cognitively challenging<br>um<br>type of social learning it was even<br>suggested initially it was thought that<br>it was only going to be present in<br>humans<br>it was even suggested that humans should<br>be called homo imitants man who imitates<br>they then see that in great apes<br>and we wanted to look to see whether<br>reptiles have this ability now<br>to do this animals are required to make<br>good boys<br>animals are required to do quite small<br>fine-grained movements and tortoises<br>have really big shields and so you<br>couldn't see it so in this case we used<br>bearded dragons<br>and actually we found that they were<br>able to do this so they didn't just<br>learn from observing the behavior of the<br>individual they replicated the movements<br>and we've since extended<br>our bloody cognition work in lots of<br>different ways asking really very pure<br>cognition questions a little bit like<br>i've showed you today i've been<br>fortunate enough to collaborate with<br>colleagues all over the world and have<br>visiting positions of primate research<br>institute which is the most phenomenal<br>primate research center but of course<br>away store and um work with the<br>tortoises<br>and i've also worked um a visiting<br>professorship at the center of my mind<br>brain sciences um university of trenton<br>and um i'm nasa who's sitting just here<br>i was working with her there and now i'm<br>very fortunate that she's my phd student<br>over here<br>and this is work which we hope to<br>continue and actually one of our bodies<br>elisa has recently moved over there and<br>so again it's really great for the<br>collaborations that we continue working<br>with this<br>so i hope i've shown you<br>do have cognitive abilities in fact they<br>actually have remarkable cognitive<br>abilities<br>now i would say moses has demonstrated<br>this really quite well he's been<br>involved in a lot of experiments he's<br>done a lot of this but actually my<br>colleague oliver<br>and his pet talk is called charlotte<br>this is charlotte and oliver is<br>absolutely convinced that charlotte is<br>way cleverer than moses<br>he's obviously wrong he won't bring<br>charlotte in<br>charlotte's not allowed to be tested his<br>child was invited here today and she<br>wasn't tested and so i thought well how<br>can we look at this so i thought what i<br>would do is we could ask moses<br>so what i have<br>this picture<br>charlotte and a picture of moses and i<br>thought i'd give him a choice and see<br>which one he chooses now i will tell you<br>there has been no pre-training<br>from it these are only printed out this<br>afternoon okay<br>and oh there is having fed lots of<br>strawberry<br>and i thought let's see what he chooses<br>just to finally put the nail in the<br>coffin of this idea that um charlotte<br>might be better so we have moses on the<br>right<br>and we have charlotte on the left right<br>now what we're going to do<br>we're going to get moses out and see why<br>the piggy approaches everyone<br>so<br>what we would normally do<br>is we will present these tasks we have<br>two visuals stimuli here<br>you can see he's looked at both of them<br>those of you who could see that<br>that's great so this is how we ask these<br>sorts of questions obviously not quite<br>now and we don't really have sources to<br>write other tortoises experiments<br>early intelligence but i thought it's<br>nice for you to see actually how you<br>so that nicely brings me on to quite a<br>lot of research that i actually do<br>collaborate with oliver on and this is<br>sort of translating what we know about<br>animal commission<br>into their care so<br>how we feel about<br>the entirety of our animals for our pets<br>or animals that live around us<br>impacts how we care about them so if you<br>think fish has a three second memory<br>you'd probably be quite happy to keep it<br>in a bowl like that<br>however if i would do the fish you'll<br>remember for at least three months<br>you might want to think about having a<br>maybe a more complicated complex<br>environment<br>and more variability for that animal<br>now<br>as i told you previously reptiles have<br>been considered to be sluggish<br>unresponsive and basically<br>as a result of that there's been almost<br>no work<br>into how into assessing their welfare<br>and their well-being<br>in captivity<br>have um started and work and in the cold<br>rugged care<br>um working group where we do lots of<br>research and we work with<br>people in the field so charities the<br>reptile pet industry to try and actually<br>assess how should we look after these<br>animals so when we first started<br>we went to the project<br>we're seeing someone i haven't seen oh<br>she isn't sick<br>um<br>pretty simple<br>it was<br>how do you actually measure welfare in<br>reptiles are the<br>are the measures we use in mammals and<br>words are they appropriate for using<br>reptiles or are they not<br>and what we found was we found that yes<br>they did seem to be appropriate but<br>there are also great measured other<br>measures that we could use with<br>tortoises the best measure to use is<br>necklace<br>if your tortoise is happy you'll see its<br>neck if it's not happy you won't<br>and this is a really good measure that<br>you can tell people and everyone can<br>remember that they'll know it and<br>they'll act on that in the future<br>so<br>we then wanted to use the information<br>that we gathered about how do we assess<br>uh practical welfare and actually look<br>at the impact of different housing<br>conditions on these animals and in this<br>particular case we were working um we<br>were working with snakes so this is one<br>of which has been done by a number of<br>fantastic researchers and students<br>and what we did was we housed it in two<br>different environments okay we have a<br>standard environment which covers basic<br>recommendations the recommendations<br>which you're going to see in a pet shop<br>and then we have an enriched environment<br>which we gave them<br>tattoos in charge of this brilliant<br>imagination of thinking about all sorts<br>of things that snakes could do and would<br>do to make sure we keep them the most<br>cognitively enriching environment that<br>we possibly could<br>and what we then did was we gave us some<br>classic tests of birth so how do they<br>respond in a local environment or to a<br>normal object<br>after this we did<br>a preference test where we actually<br>asked our stakes which do you prefer<br>so after you've lived in these<br>environments<br>we'll house them<br>where they can choose between those do<br>they choose to spend time in the<br>original environment or do they choose<br>to spend time in the standard<br>environment<br>and what we've had is that the states<br>prefer substantially to spend time in<br>the enriched environment<br>we've also done very similar work<br>looking at space so snakes are the only<br>species where um the recommendations<br>don't require that them as an animal to<br>be able to stretch<br>out in their environment<br>so we also looked at the same effect for<br>space and we found very similar results<br>when they were active states had a<br>really strong preference for the um for<br>the larger bavarian we also looked at<br>behaviors within the variable we saw<br>that the animals would be enriched<br>department or the larger firm expressed<br>more behaviors as well<br>and of course because i'm a cognitive<br>scientist we're not only learning their<br>welfare but we actually looked at how<br>those housing conditions<br>could impact um their cognition<br>so<br>what we did was we actually gave them<br>a<br>familiarity test so we gave you the<br>discrimination to see whether they were<br>able to discriminate between a familiar<br>human<br>and an unfamiliar human so after they've<br>lived in an enriched or a standard<br>environment we present them with the<br>odor<br>of humans<br>and we learn to see which they explored<br>more<br>what they interact with<br>what we found was really exciting we<br>found that the animals in the enriched<br>environment<br>were able to discriminate between<br>familiar and unfamiliar people<br>however the animals in the standard<br>environment<br>didn't<br>and that's quite remarkable and if you<br>think back to this idea that reptiles<br>are sort of sluggish<br>and unresponsive if you're keeping<br>animals in the environments which<br>actually don't allow them to express<br>their cognition<br>you're going to have serious problems<br>also we know that reptilians are<br>attached to their hair reptiles because<br>they have a great<br>and so it's our duty to try and<br>improve that human animal bond<br>and actually by improving the housing<br>conditions we can work on that and<br>and the final little thing i want to<br>tell you about mental welfare is that<br>one of the big challenges we have in<br>reptile welfare at the moment<br>is the fate of some terrorists so you<br>may all remember the teenage mutant hero<br>turtles i do<br>um and at that time in the uk and across<br>the world<br>people bought terrapins as pets<br>thousands and thousands of figures and<br>they were taking them like five million<br>there's an awful lot but these animals<br>they just live for a couple of years<br>these animals can live for a long long<br>time<br>now the species which was imported that<br>time earlier insiders<br>are actually considered to be invasive<br>in europe<br>so people have a situation that they<br>have these animals<br>no centuries could take them in<br>because they were full<br>and so the only option they had was to<br>euthanase examples<br>so one of the challenges was that<br>centuries were using standard guidelines<br>which said they're top qualifiers they<br>come from mississippi we need to house<br>them in these conditions<br>so me and the students of mine they did<br>a piece of work where we actually looked<br>at these are invasive animals where are<br>they successful what conditions can they<br>actually survive on thriving and what we<br>found was actually the outside british<br>climate was pretty much fantastic for<br>them and so um what we did alongside the<br>language of our life park by doing a lot<br>of research with is we set up the<br>national turtle<br>sanctuary which is a center where people<br>can bring their turtles if they're no<br>longer able to look after them<br>and we are now with meg and some of my<br>colleagues stefan and simon who are now<br>assessing the welfare of those animals<br>at the sanctuary it's been open for<br>about a year now and seeing how the<br>animals are coping with these<br>environments and i just want to talk<br>about this it's a really lovely<br>demonstration of how the work's been<br>sort of translated into pastoral health<br>okay<br>what i want to talk to you about now is<br>my sort of third big area of research<br>and that's in working element cognition<br>so animals are used to help humans in<br>all sorts of different tasks from<br>explosive detection to search and rescue<br>and what we're doing in our group so<br>we're brilliant people helen daniel<br>and carl<br>and we're looking to use what we know<br>about cognitive science to improve the<br>performance<br>and welfare of working animals and it's<br>really exciting to be able to take my<br>very pure work<br>and using exactly those principles in a<br>way that's going to help society and<br>help the animals that work for us<br>and so you may remember that i told you<br>at the beginning i did a lot of research<br>in pigeon visual categorization and this<br>is<br>a classic pigeon categorization task so<br>what you have<br>is you have different visual stimuli<br>and if i told you if you picked all<br>these ones you would get food can you<br>tell me what the categorical that<br>anybody<br>yeah<br>perfect that's exactly right well done<br>that's brilliant so this is a human lung<br>some information about that and creating<br>what we call a category which will then<br>allow if they get a new human picture to<br>say that's to human as well<br>and so we wanted to take these<br>principles<br>i'm actually applying to early detection<br>so can we so one of the big challenges<br>which we have<br>in the field<br>novel different explosives being<br>developed all the time so you can't<br>necessarily fail an animal on each one<br>so we've got this work dinners working<br>with helen and<br>our host lots of other people too<br>and what we did was we said well can we<br>teach them a category<br>of<br>explosives in this case we actually use<br>um<br>um different accelerants<br>it's both<br>challenging<br>and can we teach them a category of this<br>so that then when they experience<br>new<br>novel<br>members of the category<br>can they then detect it as well<br>and we have an experimental group who<br>had a categorical rule as we call it<br>which was the presence of accelerants or<br>not<br>just like the human non-human one and<br>then we had a control group who got all<br>of the same stimuli but they were<br>randomly assigned<br>okay so this is a hard task and they<br>couldn't even learn it<br>however we found that our categorization<br>group not only learned it<br>but they generalized this they were able<br>to then alert to novel instances of the<br>category<br>and they also remembered it for longer<br>than you often see as demonstrated in<br>working animals<br>so<br>i love this project it takes a really<br>pure phenomenon that we've looked at for<br>years in coalition and it applies to a<br>really personal question<br>now we've also along with lots of other<br>brilliant people we looked at different<br>training<br>methods<br>and what we did was we looked up<br>different types of training that um<br>the military might use or the detection<br>animals might use so we might use what<br>we call sequential training this is the<br>most commonly used and what they have is<br>they learn more stimulus until they've<br>learned it and then they get a lot of<br>stimulus until they've learned that<br>there's also been a thought about sort<br>of mixing all the stimuli together so<br>men thinking okay well if we've got them<br>all in one big pot can they then alert<br>all of them so that would be compound we<br>call<br>together so you get one stimulus and a<br>different one then a different one<br>because we know that that<br>from the combination literature we know<br>and that is exactly what we found so we<br>found that the rats could learn it<br>in all of the groups<br>but we found that um the internet's<br>training was they performed<br>substantially better and they performed<br>substantially better to novel<br>stimuli as well<br>and this is something which we did it<br>with grassroots are fabulous because<br>they allow us lots of control we had<br>some fantastic rest with us<br>um but we're now um working on<br>replicating this work with dogs as well<br>and looking at how rats can be used as<br>great models for detection animals<br>okay so in my final section i'm just<br>going to wish you through just a couple<br>of things that we're currently thinking<br>about<br>okay<br>and this is really to show you<br>how my work has changed for me very pure<br>animal condition to really apply those<br>big problems which we face within<br>biology and this is one of the real joys<br>i found from working in a life sciences<br>department i'm influenced and i talk to<br>very very different people which makes<br>me think in different ways<br>so the first area that we've just<br>started we've got the research sitting<br>up there who's working on this is<br>actually looking at the role that<br>cognition plays in conservation<br>so generally conservation efforts are<br>reptiles but actually in most species<br>um<br>don't take into account what an animal<br>knows<br>and so of course if anyone doesn't know<br>how to navigate around this environment<br>the likelihood that it's going to<br>survive is substantially reduced<br>and so we're working um with gopher<br>tortoises<br>in the us<br>and we're going to be working with blue<br>and yuan with the killers<br>and what we're going to do is we're<br>going to start plants give them a sort<br>of cognitive head start program where we<br>train them how to tackle the cognitive<br>challenges that they will then receive<br>in the wild when they're reintroduced<br>and it's<br>a really exciting project because<br>it can allow us to shape<br>not only their survival but also<br>potentially how they use that<br>environment as well which can<br>potentially be really important for the<br>environment itself<br>and<br>i've done a lot of work with living with<br>tom and oliver<br>looking at how commission impacts<br>and we're really interested in so if you<br>think about<br>an animal's job as a seedless person<br>generally when people think about this<br>they think about actually well the<br>animal has to<br>eat seeds poop and move<br>and that's sort of how they think about<br>the animal as a dispersal<br>but when we first started linking we all<br>started at the same time we started<br>saying what role does the animal's<br>knowledge have<br>in this<br>are we initially created one of our<br>phd team francesca<br>and we went to how<br>memory impacted the foraging decisions<br>that animals made within an environment<br>and in particular they're all the sort<br>of quality of that plants might have<br>and what we should have found<br>is we found the animals visited the<br>preferred plant<br>more often than<br>if they had a good memory than a poor<br>event<br>so this of course makes it adapted for<br>plants<br>to be preferred to give high quality<br>food<br>and we then wanted to test this<br>so what we did was we thought<br>theoretically this is really important<br>how can we look at this and so what we<br>did was we worked with the tortoises<br>and we presented our tortoises with<br>stimulants so coloured pieces of card<br>which were associated with different<br>outcomes both outcomes are quite good so<br>this is mango jelly tortoises really<br>like mango jelly<br>and<br>what was associated with the big piece<br>and what was associated with the small<br>piece we also did the same different<br>qualities<br>yummy apple jelly<br>willing to eat it just<br>about our testers learned to do this<br>and they showed that they were willing<br>to work harder for the higher values<br>reward<br>we then tested them 18 months later<br>to see if they've retained that<br>information now we totally see months of<br>interval<br>because this is um actually longer than<br>the fruiting cycles in of the trees in<br>the environments in which the animals<br>live<br>and we found that they could indeed<br>remember that<br>so they were able to remember<br>different queues associated with digital<br>reward values for over 18 months<br>which is quite remarkable from a<br>cognitive perspective but also<br>incredibly important from an ecosystem<br>perspective because if you think about<br>for the plant if the plant is producing<br>high quality food the animals might only<br>store it<br>from it on that season<br>but they will also potentially flourish<br>from it in future seasons as well<br>so it's taking build cognition thinking<br>about it in terms of ecology<br>libby and i are also just starting a<br>very exciting new project looking at um<br>service provisioning<br>so we're working with our host of data<br>in india<br>and um<br>she's got a strong interest in crop pest<br>management and biological control of<br>that<br>and generally when we think about<br>biological control they simply look at<br>the number of animals a number of pests<br>but of course how animals find and<br>forage on those resources is incredibly<br>important and so we're<br>um piece of work looking at the role<br>that cognition does play in this really<br>important<br>task<br>and the final piece of research i want<br>to tell you about is what i did a few<br>years ago<br>looking at the impact that environment<br>has on cognition and so we have basic<br>dragons<br>and we um we noticed them under<br>different infra incubation environments<br>so these are both within the normal<br>range<br>but we found that this had a profound<br>impact on the animals behavior and<br>cognition so we found that hot animals<br>could run faster and more bowls when<br>they were younger<br>but cold animals were clever<br>and you think about and these are just<br>animals which are incubated within the<br>normal range and you think about how<br>that small differences and environment<br>can impact their behavior cognition<br>okay so as you may have noticed in this<br>talk<br>i'm quite fond of tortoises and<br>something which hasn't just happened<br>so i've been filled with tortoises for<br>quite a lot of my life and i'm also very<br>happy that nathaniel<br>is he's he's left building but he's also<br>very fond of tortoises and that's<br>something that's really important to me<br>to bring him up<br>and i just want to finish by thanking my<br>brilliant colleagues and friends i've<br>talked about research projects i've<br>focused on just a few of the research<br>projects that i'm involved with but i<br>work with lots of different people both<br>for research and teaching and they've<br>had a huge impact on me so wanted to<br>ask everybody but these are some people<br>who um really have had a profound impact<br>on my work and of course even more<br>importantly my research students have<br>only talked about a tiny bit of the work<br>we've done and these are some but again<br>not all of my research students and<br>postdocs who i work with closely<br>so just to conclude<br>i would say research is about people and<br>influence so my work has been hugely<br>influenced by the people i work<br>with<br>and the people who<br>exchange ideas with me and i think<br>that's something which is so hugely<br>important<br>i also have some any of our students out<br>there<br>then you can work with animals and not<br>be event<br>in fact of the students who i've<br>mentioned even briefly in that we've got<br>students in academia we've got them um<br>assisting both charities detection plug<br>agencies education are students with<br>authors you know there's a huge variety<br>of things that you can do within this<br>sphere<br>i also hope i've shown you that it's<br>worth studying commission in reptiles<br>and i'd just like to finish by thanking<br>my family um for<br>thank you anna uh we do have time for a<br>couple of questions<br>uh because i think he's getting past<br>i had a um<br>that all virgin friends except humans<br>have the same cognitive abilities that<br>discriminate<br>about this<br>and actually what we see is to some<br>extent learning<br>the way learning works is the same<br>across most<br>systems<br>so we know that<br>but actually what we see is we see<br>behavioral predispositions for certain<br>things so a really<br>great example is something like a<br>clark's nutcracker which is a food story<br>bird and they can store foods in<br>thousands of different places and go<br>back<br>and access that food again so i think<br>what we would probably now<br>say is that the<br>the challenges that the animal faces in<br>fantastic so i think um<br>i'd like everyone to to offer an another<br>is<br>but we do need to give her a chance to<br>get a glass of wine<br>uh if you would like to join us for<br>refreshments then please try and leave<br>on this level<br>and you'll be just where you're needed<br>otherwise if you go back<br>all the way down the steps so thank you<br>very much everybody and uh i'll see you<br>in a moment<br>cup with basketball</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
