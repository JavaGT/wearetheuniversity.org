welcome<br>you all to<br>today's seminar<br>the title is sanctions supply chains and<br>shortages the economic impact of the war<br>in ukraine and i want to hand over now<br>to um professor and we are with<br>professor practice um<br>and the inaugural holder of the chair<br>for pacific region business<br>um he's um perfect to be as uh this role<br>is a host today because he has also<br>recently uh published a paper on the<br>weaponization of money<br>um could this be the first economic<br>world war which explores the impact of<br>russia's innovation of ukraine so over<br>to you ellen<br>well thank you alex kiara welcome<br>everybody to this webinar<br>it's<br>exactly one month ago that vladimir<br>putin ordered his troops to go into<br>ukraine<br>and most of us were surprised and<br>shocked at what happened<br>and since then victoria university has<br>been<br>considering what it can do<br>and<br>ultimately to do what universities and<br>academics can do which is to analyze to<br>understand to educate<br>about this phenomenon<br>we recognize it's a very complex<br>historical geopolitical situation we<br>recognize there's some terrible<br>humanitarian costs going on at the time<br>we want to throw light on one particular<br>aspect that is the economic implications<br>so<br>to do that we've got together a great<br>panel for you and<br>i would like to introduce olga<br>sparanskaya she's an economist she's a<br>business growth expert she's been<br>involved in startups and other<br>issues in wellington<br>at the wellington school of business<br>and she's contributing to the executive<br>mba professional development program<br>we will then follow with<br>dr eldred kahia he is senior lecturer in<br>international business at the wellington<br>school of business and government<br>we will go on to grant spencer<br>who's teaching fellow in the financial<br>economics at the wellington school of<br>business and government<br>and has been had a long career in<br>banking and central banking in new<br>zealand and elsewhere and has been<br>acting governor of the reserve bank of<br>new zealand<br>and then fourthly to veronica kasravili<br>who is a program and project management<br>professional consultant worked in<br>wellington for a long time she's<br>recently completed her executive mba at<br>the wellington school of business and<br>government as well<br>we're going to get some different<br>perspectives from all of those<br>we are going to really look for the<br>effects of three particular things the<br>russian<br>invasion on ukraine<br>the international sanctions on russia<br>and the overall effects on the world<br>so<br>with the invasion<br>we've seen disruption to a not<br>insignificant primary producing economy<br>ukraine<br>which is a big producer by world<br>standards of wheat and barley and<br>sunflower and corn<br>and actually urea for fertilizer and<br>right at this moment there's<br>wheat there's winter and spring<br>cereal production going on or not going<br>on depending on its disruption and<br>whether or not those harvests come<br>through will be still to be seen it's<br>also a significant exporter of coal<br>and steel<br>and<br>oil and gas<br>and other engineering items in addition<br>then we've got the russian sanctions and<br>we<br>know that<br>they are already led to sanctioning of<br>oil and gas exports into many countries<br>not to the eu as year<br>sanctioning of agricultural exports<br>sanctioning of the nordstrom 2 pipeline<br>sanctioning of technology and military<br>imports into russia<br>the end of a lot of inward foreign<br>direct investment into russia<br>sanctioning of a number of banks<br>and<br>in addition effectively the central bank<br>as well<br>cutting off<br>for many of them<br>access to the swift financial messaging<br>scheme<br>as freezing assets<br>sanctioning state and enterprises a<br>number of western companies have<br>withdrawn from activities in russia the<br>oligarchs have been focused on with<br>regard to their property their financial<br>assets their planes their super yachts<br>russia has faced sanctions before<br>in fact in 2014<br>with the invasion of crimea there were a<br>number of economic sanctions put in<br>place but this is big it's much bigger<br>actually it's the biggest ever economic<br>sanctioning since well outside war ever<br>in the world<br>the<br>experts on this the global sanctions<br>database<br>record a large number of economic<br>sanctions since world war ii<br>and they have researched them and say<br>that most of them cause significant<br>economic damage<br>do they actually achieve what they want<br>to achieve do they contribute to their<br>objectives they say about half the cases<br>they looked at have contributed to some<br>extent to their objectives<br>but they also point out there are human<br>rights costs and there are humanitarian<br>costs from sanctions as well it's not a<br>simple feature<br>and then we're also interested in<br>not just what the economic impacts on<br>russia are but also the economic impacts<br>on the rest of the world<br>and economic impacts on<br>sanction busting third countries as well<br>so it's a complex and big picture<br>and as we go in and look at the economic<br>and try and unpin the economic<br>implications of what's going on<br>let's turn first of all to<br>olga's periscope olga can we hand over<br>to you thanks to give us some context<br>and some background on these economies<br>thanks alan uh cure everyone and i'm<br>obviously a russian and the first thing<br>i need to say is i'm sorry<br>i think a lot of russians that are um in<br>the same boat as me feeling the same way<br>i would say the same thing in a forum<br>like this<br>uh the last four weeks have been very<br>very difficult emotional and you know<br>feeling the guilt uh and probably the<br>strongest feeling is being useless and<br>so i think a forum like this i've been<br>looking really looking forward to this<br>conversation because you just never know<br>how uh contributing to an understanding<br>could actually empower somebody<br>somewhere to make a decision<br>that will ultimately bring an end to the<br>invasion and make everything<br>if not back to what it was before make<br>everything better<br>i have a few points to make but i'll<br>start with some context as alan said<br>this is kind of what i do and they the<br>head i wear<br>when i walk about my<br>daily<br>daily things in in new zealand<br>i do have a lot of history even though i<br>spent the last nearly 20 years in new<br>zealand my connections are still very<br>very strong both in ukraine and russia<br>um i won't go as far as ivan the<br>terrible<br>which is very tempting because some of<br>the problems economic in the economic<br>system have started there but i'll go as<br>far as 1992 and they as a wee story um i<br>was at university then in moscow and one<br>of the exciting things that i was<br>doing having a little bit of english<br>i was employed as a translator quite a<br>bit and uh i was working at the uh the<br>first expo which is was called usa 1992<br>um which brought leaders of major<br>american corporations and leaders of<br>russian businesses a lot of them still<br>stayed owned and there were ukrainian<br>businesses at the expo it was really<br>really exciting and<br>a lot of deals were negotiated maybe not<br>signed but this was the start of<br>something<br>that would um include russia and<br>the global economy a lot better than it<br>was before it was the first year after<br>independence for a lot of the<br>former soviet states um there was<br>certainly an air of hope and opportunity<br>around all of that<br>things continued on a reasonably um good<br>good um in reasonably good vein uh<br>throughout the 90s and by the mid 90s<br>incomes have started rising and startups<br>starting appearing everywhere like<br>mushrooms we even had 2 000 banks<br>registered at one stage so this was<br>vibrant<br>this was entrepreneurial and certainly<br>the system changes were supporting that<br>it wasn't a perfect system because<br>this was led by a lot of oligarchs<br>and the um some of the parameters were<br>um certainly skewed by virtue of having<br>to change the different speed uh system<br>in at speed<br>um but people understood at that stage<br>that these were largely growing pains<br>and the hope was that would grow out of<br>it and um end up with a system that was<br>conducive with being a an advanced<br>technologically and economically<br>advanced country<br>integrated into a western style system<br>by the end of 90s however um<br>different sort of power structures<br>started playing and 1999 when the<br>intelligence and military<br>came to power led by vladimir putin<br>things started going downhill at an<br>accelerated pace so<br>that<br>important context<br>led to some system features that i want<br>to emphasize today because i think that<br>they're important in understanding the<br>impact<br>of the war itself and and the sanctions<br>and the reactions um on the world<br>the first um<br>system feature is a broken economic<br>system that was supposed to support<br>entrepreneurship but actually in reality<br>didn't<br>um examples of that would be<br>freedoms and ability to do business<br>transparently<br>uh obviously deep deep-seated corruption<br>and probably the worst example of that<br>was that at some point during the early<br>2000s businesses that were successful<br>grew large were largely driven by<br>entrepreneurial people that were<br>starting something interesting made a<br>bit of money these businesses started<br>being approached um by intelligence<br>agencies in the military and started<br>being taken over so um in that<br>environment you can't really start<br>businesses<br>and a lot of people that were capable of<br>doing that went overseas<br>so that's that's um broken that broken<br>system<br>is is there now and it's impacting<br>everything second feature is too much<br>global integration i'm saying too much<br>because too much relative to how russia<br>wants to position itself and how it<br>wants to<br>um to be in in the global economic<br>system i think if this war was predicted<br>and calculated maybe economic<br>integration um into supply chains and<br>inviting foreign direct investment<br>wouldn't have been so enthusiastically<br>supported in the early days<br>um but we'll talk about this later<br>there's some pretty major implications<br>at the moment from<br>from the sanctions that stem from<br>the russian economy being super<br>integrated into supply chains<br>independent in some in some instances<br>and the third feature that we all know<br>very very well is a resource curse<br>we haven't learned from examples of<br>other countries uh who maybe acted a<br>little bit smarter so we took the money<br>um it's settled in in the pockets of the<br>few to the point that we're now seeing<br>uh you know gold-plated toilet rolls and<br>super yachts<br>this has become a um a real curse that<br>uh limited the development of new<br>technology where the incentives weren't<br>there to invest in perhaps diversifying<br>the sectors<br>limiting the country's development to uh<br>to a resource base<br>and basically everything uh stem stems a<br>little bit from there<br>one of the bigger aspects of that lack<br>of investment was the lack of import<br>substitution and creating local products<br>that could that could<br>become internationally competitive<br>a small sort of word on ukraine i<br>followed ukraine superficially i guess<br>over the years<br>i knew that they were grown in<br>independence and<br>that would probably use as modernising<br>but with some problems we know that they<br>hadn't been very successful in steeming<br>corruption within the business and the<br>political system but<br>directionally they were going in in a<br>reasonably sort of western and<br>successful successful way um and of<br>course everything changed on february<br>24th um with with the invasion<br>i'll talk about impacts on ukraine first<br>i think uh the main uh the main impact<br>as as as we all see<br>on television is demolition is physical<br>destruction so the absence of<br>infrastructure uh places to live<br>displacement of potential workers and<br>leaders of business and anyone basically<br>who can hold the gun being in the army<br>at the moment and massive massive<br>disruptions and supply chains<br>um<br>impact wise from you know even<br>months or years into into the future uh<br>my main recommendation the main<br>statement that i'll make is that ukraine<br>will be okay<br>as it emerges out of the war one way or<br>another none of us know how it will end<br>and how long it will take it sounds like<br>or it looks like it might take a while<br>um but it will emerge out of the war as<br>a free country and everyone will rush to<br>help ukraine rebuild<br>there are some financial considerations<br>there<br>but we need not forget reparations and<br>quite significant money that's frozen<br>in<br>overseas accounts<br>and that russia has no access to at the<br>moment but<br>my feeling on on ukraine is that there<br>will be a lot of good world that will be<br>accepted with open arms everywhere and<br>that their people that are currently<br>displaced will come back and help the<br>country rebuild<br>so i've got no major concerns for<br>ukraine um other than you know very<br>significant humanitarian concerns right<br>now<br>russia on the other hand at the moment<br>as a raging bull that seems to be<br>charging um at everyone and everything<br>in the hope uh that it will make it feel<br>better because it wasn't feeling great<br>even before the invasion i think it's<br>fair to say um that the leaders that<br>started the war definitely miscalculated<br>the price that it was going to bring<br>and i think the unification of both<br>ukraine and the defence and the rest of<br>the world and<br>condemning the invasion and the<br>sanctions that followed it definitely<br>wasn't calculated then<br>i do<br>want to say that you know sanctions play<br>a major role but i think uh for me the<br>impacts i'm seeing right now sanctions<br>are probably slower moving in slower<br>acting the impacts that are a lot more<br>significant a lot more felt and a lot<br>more visible to the people on the ground<br>the ones that are living<br>have stayed in russia there's been a lot<br>of a lot of exits<br>as as foreign companies and foreign<br>direct investment leaving<br>leaving the shores of russia<br>i recommend following<br>the<br>university of yale<br>who have compiled and are continuing to<br>compile a real-time database and<br>compilation of companies they're in<br>different categories some have left<br>outright some have<br>continued some operations um it's okay<br>some pointers<br>pepsico<br>they left their drinks division is out<br>of russia but they've left their potato<br>chips<br>um growing harvesting and packaging on<br>the grounds that it's an essential good<br>um so there are some examples of quite<br>mixed sort of reactions uh from foreign<br>businesses and there's a reasonable<br>number of them that actually have stayed<br>and<br>i've got um personally question marks<br>over uh some japanese and french<br>interests that are leaving and some that<br>are staying i'm not quite sure how that<br>is going to play out<br>and what impact china and india will<br>have on acting as a compensatory partner<br>for russia and the goods that cannot be<br>got any other way<br>but<br>probably fair to say that the rest of<br>the world is leaving russia alone<br>i'll use two words to describe<br>impacts on russia one is volatility<br>unprecedented extreme volatility in<br>everything pricing<br>product availability supply chain nobody<br>really knows where to go<br>and the system and economic system<br>common word i'm hearing or phrase i'm<br>hearing is that the economic system does<br>not exist it might exist in the future<br>but it's actually self-destructed<br>and isolation<br>so<br>the doom<br>has<br>sort of already<br>become a reality in some degrees there's<br>some very pragmatic things that people<br>are looking at for example<br>you know down to earth so female hygiene<br>program products are not available at<br>all so they have gone out the window<br>printing paper so basic functions uh for<br>example medical institutions have been<br>forbidden to print anything even<br>prescriptions because the only paper<br>that russia can produce without the<br>whitening agent that's made in finland<br>100 of it is yellow paper that's more<br>resembling sandpaper<br>so<br>there are huge concerns about<br>availability of some pretty<br>basic and fundamental things<br>my humanitarian concern<br>is<br>for the people that are left in russia<br>and that will live through that<br>is threefold one is pharmaceuticals<br>uh there's definitely a huge number of<br>them that are internationally made once<br>they run out and they've got an expiry<br>date so that will be<br>a year and a half to two years from now<br>that will be a major major issue um<br>transport anything that carries people<br>uh fast forward two years i'll be scared<br>to go on public transport or fly<br>anywhere or take take to take a train<br>and third one is energy infrastructure<br>like power to binds russia has<br>undertaken a significant modernization<br>program and a lot of these um this<br>equipment is made in italy and other<br>places and there's no way to maintain<br>that so these things will start failing<br>um so<br>and and in terms of you know other<br>impacts i think uh we're lucky it's<br>summer for everyone's sake at the moment<br>um and my prediction for russia and i<br>say this with a big heartache<br>is that russia won't matter<br>so as a trading partner very soon and<br>maybe forever<br>um i won't say say that lightly but i<br>think that's um kind of the impact i'm<br>seeing<br>in the natural outcome of events right<br>now<br>um i don't want to leave you on a sort<br>of gloomy note like this russians are<br>very um known for um<br>joking in the darkest circumstances<br>there's a going joke there's many um but<br>the one that's kind of more economic uh<br>in nature is the one<br>uh you should keep your savings in a<br>pile of rubles no burglar in the same<br>mind would look there<br>thank you<br>ukraine<br>thank you olga<br>and thank you for your insight and also<br>your courage in doing it and we<br>we feel for you and that your position<br>on that<br>we'll come back to olga<br>and it's a chance for<br>participants if they've got any<br>questions they'd like to pose to the<br>panel to put them into the chat function<br>they're only going to be seen by the<br>panel and the organizers not by other<br>participants<br>we'll be curating them here and putting<br>some of those questions to the panel<br>thank you olga we're now going to go to<br>eldred<br>and hear his views on impacts on trade<br>supply chains and all the things that<br>thank you alan uh<br>kiara<br>um so the things that i want to talk<br>about uh briefly here some of them have<br>already started coming up um<br>from olga's<br>presentation and also from<br>the initial briefing that uh allen<br>gabriel has done so if you think of<br>russia and you think of ukraine you are<br>thinking primarily of two things in<br>terms of their impact on the world<br>food<br>and fuel and we are going to get almost<br>a double whammy of disruptions in that<br>regard um one one area of disruption is<br>the actual production of these of these<br>fundamentals in these two countries and<br>then you are we're also we're going to<br>have to deal with the supply chain<br>related concerns that are arising from<br>europe gets 40 percent of its uh of its<br>uh gas out from from russia and that<br>dependence is still quite quite strong<br>and um<br>we've seen already with uh with the<br>disruptions the extent to which prices<br>are rising so i think the price of a<br>bottle of oil has gone back to its<br>streets highest since uh 2014<br>and i think the price of uh low sulfur<br>loss alpha fuel that's used in shipping<br>vessels has actually doubled<br>to about a thousand dollars a time a<br>metric ton that's twice as much as the<br>price uh prior to the pandemic so these<br>are things that we're actually going to<br>to to have to deal with and a lot of the<br>large<br>shipping companies they are looking at<br>this and saying oh this is additional<br>cost this is additional risk to us so<br>the risk of insuring uh vessels um you<br>know especially the ones that are going<br>in and around the black sea at the<br>moment that cost has gone from about one<br>to about five percent of the ship's uh<br>ship's value so these are real costs not<br>nationally margin because real costs<br>that we're gonna have to uh to grapple<br>with also the impact on fuel the impact<br>on food which is another aspect that<br>alan mentioned at the very start<br>so corn wheat<br>barley sunflower seeds<br>both countries are big very big players<br>in this regard russia huge plant ukraine<br>as well<br>and a lot of this product um<br>is actually destined for for sub-saharan<br>africa in in in a lot of cases i think<br>sub-saharan africa imports as much as<br>eight to nine billion from ukraine and<br>russia combined off cereals of seed of<br>wheat of valley of corn<br>and these are going this is going to be<br>quite problematic if this product cannot<br>be produced or be moved uh very quickly<br>to to the to the areas in which it is<br>needed so that's just the production<br>side the shipping side i think is even<br>uh sort of more worrisome if we start to<br>look at the specifics of what's been<br>happening there<br>are significant disruptions to the<br>supply chains at the moment i think all<br>got touched on this initially uh<br>mentioning that you know the the<br>integration is itself is russia too<br>integrated into the world economy i<br>think this is where we are starting to<br>see some evidence of that<br>so if we look at sea freight i will go<br>over all modes of transport here but<br>i'll just talk about sea freight and air<br>cargo very quickly uh if we look at sea<br>freight for a start so the la the three<br>of the largest shipping companies in the<br>world<br>um mask<br>i think out of denmark<br>um mediterranean shipping company out of<br>switzerland and cma cgm out of out of<br>france all three have said you know what<br>we're not taking new shipments into or<br>out of russia so no new bookings that we<br>are taking until such a time that we<br>know for you know how what the future is<br>going to look like<br>uh the large um you know korea companies<br>the ghls fedexes they've taken a similar<br>similar stance as well and we have<br>several ports in europe and in<br>particular in the uk that are not<br>allowing ships uh from russia uh to dock<br>or ships carrying uh russian goods to<br>dock then the flip side of this we also<br>have vessels that are going through<br>russia going to parts of this region<br>that are now facing multiple rounds of<br>physical inspections and all of this<br>creates delays and creates additional<br>cost so i think as we speak this close<br>to a hundred ships and there are crew<br>that are stranded in ports in ukraine<br>and all of these things are presenting<br>um quite quite a significant challenge<br>if we look at air cargo<br>so<br>from the sanctions alone right so<br>russian airspace is off limits and uh<br>the flip side to that you know the us eu<br>canada among other countries have also<br>banned russian aircraft from using their<br>own uh airspace now what is this what<br>this does now is it squeezes in an<br>already very very tight or difficult<br>global air cargo capacity<br>so for example for instance flights that<br>are<br>coming from europe and going to into<br>asia<br>are being rerouted<br>and the cost of rerouting that is quite<br>is quite significant<br>a typical flight to london to talk to<br>flight<br>because of the rerouting<br>now takes an additional two and a half<br>hours<br>to complete<br>now if you ask you if we if we follow<br>along with some of the modeling that<br>flight rate i've done on this<br>uh a boeing triple seven<br>uh that's flying london to tokyo with<br>that additional two and a half hours<br>from the re-routing will require an<br>additional five thousand five hundred<br>gallons of fuel that's a twenty percent<br>increase on the carrier whether that's<br>you know a fedex a ups a ghl and a new<br>zealand that means you know its<br>significant additional cost<br>and that uh that 5 500 gallons of fuel<br>translates to about 60 tons of<br>additional co2<br>now if you multiply this<br>by default 500 flights that are being<br>diverted or rerouted every month you<br>start to see how uh difficult and how<br>challenging all of these circumstances<br>are and these all of these additional<br>costs are going to have to be passed on<br>to some end user a traveler uh you know<br>an importer an exporter so eventually<br>all of these things uh will have to you<br>know somebody will actually have to to<br>pay the cost of that<br>so these are very very challenging uh<br>aspects at the moment especially given<br>that in 2022 at least at the start there<br>was a bit of momentum in sort of the<br>global logistics industry that hey we<br>are turning the corner the west of kobe<br>has come and gone but i think um<br>what we are seeing now develop as a<br>result of the sanctions and the<br>disruption is uh something that will set<br>back the industry for a few a few months<br>if not another year or two<br>now impacts to uh to new zealand i think<br>new zealand uh so far we've been uh<br>fairly lucky fairly insulated and by<br>impact here i'm just confining some of<br>my sentiments or my points to the<br>impacts on our tradable sector our<br>importers and our expo<br>i think a lot of the impact so far is<br>mostly indirect right we have to deal<br>with the impact of our energy costs and<br>fuel prices uh just as a country<br>as the situation develops but if we are<br>looking specifically at imports and<br>exports<br>new zealand is not particularly exposed<br>to russia<br>in that regard i think exports to about<br>270 million a year imports of about 150<br>million a year so that is not very very<br>significant<br>if we draw this down a little bit and<br>maybe go to the sort of situation with<br>fonterra you'll also see that um you<br>know it's been relatively easy for<br>fonterra to say okay initially we are<br>going to stop our exports to russia<br>i think that was mostly bada as well and<br>then for them to eventually i think last<br>week to say oh actually we are calling<br>off you know the international joint<br>venture and we are just going to you<br>know um share of our russian operations<br>i think for fonterra that's just one<br>percent of their exports which they they<br>will be<br>very<br>they will be able to reallocate<br>uh in their other export markets very<br>easily so i think for now this is where<br>i'll leave some some of my points um<br>we'll return to i think hopefully some<br>well thank you eldridge that's very<br>interesting of some very practical<br>things that you're talking about in<br>terms of trade disruption<br>now what about finance what about<br>investment what about capital flows and<br>all the lifeblood of an economy that's<br>running through those financial markets<br>can we turn to grant expenses so grant<br>thank you<br>uh thanks alan and kia ora everyone<br>so i look at the impact of the sanctions<br>from a market's perspective and a<br>and in terms of the impact of these<br>sanctions onto the global economy going<br>in that direction the main transmission<br>we're really talking about here is this<br>huge increase in commodity prices<br>uh the doubling of oil and gas prices<br>big increases in cereals<br>and the range of metals<br>this is effectively an adverse supply<br>shock<br>which is going to impact<br>the global economy from the point of<br>view of pushing up inflation<br>uh pushing up interest rates<br>and<br>weakening overall economic activity and<br>so this is how the markets were<br>perceiving it so stock markets<br>tended to weaken<br>uh there was a move to safe haven assets<br>and<br>you know the overall effect there's not<br>many estimates as yet but oecd has<br>estimated that<br>world gdp<br>may weaken by about 1<br>this year<br>and inflation may increase<br>two and a half percent<br>over and above what would otherwise have<br>now in russia of course um it's a much<br>more dramatic effect as as people have<br>been saying<br>the ruble dropped 40<br>there was a run on cash from the banks<br>panic buying<br>of food and imported goods<br>uh the stock market crashed and was<br>trading was suspended<br>and the central bank of russia who came<br>in and tried to sort of<br>uh prop up uh the the ruble and moderate<br>the impact on the domestic banking<br>system<br>they increased interest rates<br>more than doubled them from eight and a<br>half percent to twenty percent<br>they<br>supported the banks with liquidity<br>and put in place uh<br>foreign exchange controls to try and<br>conserve<br>uh foreign exchange resources<br>in the economy so the central bank was<br>trying to soften and effectively<br>softening the financial<br>the blow to the financial system<br>or in russia<br>but<br>there's not much doubt that there will<br>be a real significant hit on the russian<br>economy<br>uh in terms of<br>a recession<br>and estimates i've seen put that maybe<br>10 to 15 percent<br>weaker gdp this year and potentially<br>inflation<br>up to 25 by the end of the year<br>with persistent shortages and<br>bottlenecks<br>that that we've heard about<br>so<br>there's no doubt it'll be a significant<br>uh economic hit i think there's a big<br>question though about you know how long<br>this is going to last like eldrid<br>mentioned<br>you know<br>just<br>transport disruptions<br>from maybe a few months or maybe one to<br>two years<br>in terms of picking that time horizon<br>i i think is quite difficult<br>um on the financial side<br>it's<br>um<br>important to recognize that<br>russia is actually more resilient<br>now than it was in previous crises say<br>in either in 1998 or in the gfc<br>um its government accounts have been in<br>a pretty strong position<br>there's a low level of public debt<br>that's been running a current account<br>surplus<br>and has a net positive external<br>financial position<br>so you have to say that russia is<br>actually less reliant on the<br>international<br>funding and financial markets than it<br>has been in previous<br>so<br>um and and and<br>you'd have to say that actually the<br>russian government finances could even<br>be strengthened given the oil prices<br>doubling<br>and so as long as the europeans continue<br>to buy oil from<br>gas from russia<br>you know it's going to give the<br>russian authorities<br>the wherewithal financially to<br>buffer the the country from this big<br>shock<br>just uh<br>on a couple of the um<br>financial sanctions<br>um<br>following the clampdown of the on the<br>big russian banks and the freezing of<br>foreign exchange assets<br>um it was expected in the international<br>markets that the russians might default<br>on their foreign currency debt and that<br>debt was downgraded from investment<br>grade to junk<br>but so far the<br>russians have actually met<br>the debt service payments<br>and it does seem that the russia is<br>intent on avoiding default<br>but you know even if the west sort of<br>force put pressure on to force a default<br>um<br>you'd have to say that given the<br>relatively low level<br>of foreign debt the reliance on the<br>international markets<br>that may not be um you know a huge<br>impost<br>on the<br>russian economy if they if they were<br>indeed forced to default<br>um just on the on the payment side of<br>things<br>the other main<br>sanction we we saw was as alan mentioned<br>the exclusion<br>of eight large russian banks<br>from the swift um international<br>messaging system for for interbank<br>payments<br>and this clearly will damage<br>those uh<br>banking institutions<br>but i think you have to question um<br>whether this<br>the impact that this will have on<br>russia's ability to make payments for<br>goods and services and capital<br>transactions<br>going forward<br>and that's because firstly the west<br>have left<br>significant exemptions for energy and<br>debt payments<br>secondly<br>uh payments will i think be increasingly<br>diverted<br>through smaller russian banks who remain<br>in the switch system and through chinese<br>and indian banks<br>many of whom seem uh quite keen to pick<br>up that business<br>so<br>it's very hard to apply real<br>effectively sustainable<br>sanctions through the payment system<br>given the ability of money to get<br>so<br>overall i would say clearly russia the<br>russian economy is going to take<br>a serious hit this year<br>with the slump in activity<br>high inflation and the significant you<br>know shortages in many areas<br>however<br>financially<br>russia will remain in a relatively<br>strong position to absorb the shock<br>provided<br>europe continues to<br>buy<br>oil and gas from russia<br>and furthermore i would expect<br>the impact of the sanctions will be<br>eroded through time as both trade and<br>payments<br>increasingly get diverted through<br>third markets and in particular through<br>china<br>oh thank you grant that the pretty<br>interesting perspective on that we're<br>going to come back to<br>soon as well<br>so now my pleasure to hand over to<br>veronica kasweli<br>and veronica has been living in new<br>zealand for some years she's in new<br>zealand but she<br>comes originally from georgia and has<br>family in georgia and of course georgia<br>has experience with russia<br>veronica thank you<br>thank you alan um<br>well i've been thinking about the i<br>guess the view that i should take on the<br>current situation considering that we<br>are talking about macro economic<br>influences as a result of russia's<br>invasion into ukraine and i thought that<br>perhaps the unique perspective that i<br>could bring to the conversation is um<br>maybe from a perspective of a country<br>that is a neighboring country that was<br>part of the soviet union and has<br>experienced<br>uh some of the similar i guess um<br>aggression of the foreign um russian<br>politics in the past uh you might be<br>well i guess um aware of the<br>invasion in 2008 and the five-day war<br>that russia had experienced back then<br>uh with russia still occupying<br>approximately 20 of georgian territory<br>and of course the folks of what i'd like<br>to cover off is really the economic<br>relationship between the countries and<br>what the current situation might mean<br>for the wider region particularly<br>neighboring areas<br>uh without going into the description of<br>the economic sanctions which have<br>already been very well covered by other<br>panelists i guess the summary that i<br>would like to bring to this conversation<br>is that<br>the current sanctions that russia is<br>experiencing of course um affects um the<br>elites in russia quite a bit<br>however i guess the sentiment from the<br>general population is that the<br>withdrawal of the large internationals<br>from the russian market and perhaps<br>disappearance of some of the products<br>may not be of quite so much impact on<br>the general population<br>people are expecting the effects that<br>could be similar to the potential<br>complete economic devastation that<br>happened in the post-soviet collapse<br>period in 91<br>but perhaps on the other hand because<br>people have experienced it in 91 than in<br>98<br>the<br>threat of further economic i guess<br>sanctions and difficulties<br>is not having quite such a big effect on<br>the general population that probably<br>feels that they can weather the storm if<br>you like<br>now the reason obviously we've we've<br>been having difficulties and the<br>economic collapse did occur in the<br>period in the post-soviet union collapse<br>period<br>is because of the supply chains and how<br>they were structured originally as part<br>of the wider soviet union where many of<br>the countries were basically<br>disconnected from the overarching supply<br>chain and were unable to carry on<br>producing their products being heavily<br>dependent on other states and russia<br>very much in particular<br>and ever since the<br>soviet union collapsed russia remained<br>the key trade partner for many of the<br>surrounding countries<br>and throughout the recent history<br>despite the potential geopolitical<br>conflicts that may have been in place<br>ultimately speaking the sanctions on<br>russia therefore could potentially<br>affect the neighboring countries who are<br>still currently reliant on trade with<br>russia<br>and may or may not be on the list of the<br>unfriendly countries<br>at the moment<br>for instance many of the businesses and<br>if i was to speak for georgia for<br>example a lot of the export from georgia<br>is still predominantly into russia with<br>some expert into<br>european union and other places<br>and<br>many of the families are actually<br>directly relying on the revenue that<br>would be sent by their family members<br>that are located in russia or living in<br>russia or working in russia and would be<br>sending money back to support them so<br>the sanctions in russia could<br>potentially have the wider effect on the<br>surrounding countries and the<br>neighboring countries regardless of how<br>good or bad the<br>political environment is and the<br>relationship is between the two i guess<br>as a result of the sanctions as well and<br>the evolving situation what i'd like to<br>point out as well is the new emerging<br>the migration pattern that<br>has<br>developed<br>over the last month um<br>obviously we see<br>a massive migration out of ukraine<br>um as refugees into eu and other<br>countries that are welcoming those<br>people and we know that new zealand will<br>be welcoming up to 4 000<br>individuals<br>of people who are related to the<br>ukrainians who are already living in new<br>zealand but the interesting<br>observation i'd like to i guess point<br>out is that since the<br>restrictions on free speech that have<br>been recently imposed in russia many of<br>the russians are looking for a way to<br>move out of russia to different<br>countries and specifically georgia has<br>been experiencing<br>tens of thousands of russian migrants<br>leaving russia and moving to georgia<br>temporarily or just waiting out either<br>the economic sanctions<br>or just observing how the environment is<br>going to evolve and i must say of those<br>individuals<br>many of them are highly skilled there<br>are many it professionals and many<br>specialists in other areas which sort of<br>in itself is offering um some degree<br>perhaps an opportunity for the<br>neighboring<br>nations as well to<br>acquire the skilled labor that perhaps<br>they may have a shortage in or<br>generally require for further economic<br>development<br>that could potentially be um<br>something that could be useful for new<br>zealand as well considering our own<br>labor shortages here and um the need to<br>bring in the skilled labor particularly<br>in say ict<br>medical profession and so on and so<br>forth<br>now um going back to the economic<br>dependence and influence over the<br>neighboring countries um<br>from russia obviously that invites<br>political pressure and influence as well<br>which has been evident in many of the<br>countries of the region and again i can<br>specifically refer to georgia<br>learning from this experience i guess<br>the<br>next steps for the neighboring countries<br>that are dependent on trade with russia<br>will be looking for further independence<br>economic independence and independence<br>in trade perhaps not putting all their<br>eggs in the single basket and varying<br>their<br>trade<br>trade routes and trade agreements with<br>others<br>um this strongly links to the energy<br>supply restrictions to unfriendly<br>countries that we have been experiencing<br>recently and the price inflation<br>stemming from the sanctions in post and<br>russia this could become an additional<br>catalyst i guess in speeding up the<br>uptake of perhaps sustainable energy<br>generation in the longer term<br>however in the immediate future this<br>could continue contribute um<br>contributing towards the price<br>inflation<br>um with regards to the points of<br>heightened importance in independence<br>and energy sources i'd like to actually<br>draw your attention to the existing<br>pipelines um that are part of the<br>southern gas corridor<br>and as well as the uh oil pipelines so<br>you would be aware that there is a bakut<br>bakutvili<br>oil pipeline that<br>carries oil basically from azerbaijan<br>all the way to sehan in<br>in<br>turkey<br>and if parallel to that pipeline there<br>is uh bakuleshi air zero gas pipeline<br>um which are basically strategic<br>projects um diversifying energy supplies<br>and uh offering new opportunities um to<br>europe to actually have access to gas<br>and oil<br>from non-russian um sources if you like<br>from that perspective it's um quite<br>interesting actually um obviously the<br>bakut bilisi um arizona guest pipeline<br>which is called trans-anatolian<br>trans-anatolian pipeline<br>did connect to trans-adriatic pipeline<br>as well so it carries gas<br>through greece onto italy but with the<br>development of trans-ed adriatic<br>pipeline there was actually a stop put<br>onto a different pipeline that referred<br>to it as nabacco the buccal pipeline<br>that was originally planned to carry gas<br>from azerbaijan via turkey<br>to all the way to<br>austria actually to the border of<br>germany so that project was originally<br>stopped in 2013 but it is possible that<br>considering the current circumstances<br>and the further desire to actually<br>uh diversify the energy sources in uh in<br>europe perhaps there is an opportunity<br>to revisit the possibility of that<br>project being reignited<br>to<br>diversify the sources<br>now<br>the current sanctions and the current<br>evolving macroeconomic situation is<br>likely<br>to in my view leads to<br>the desire to be more self-reliant<br>in energy production or<br>in other areas we have seen in<br>post-covered environment that has<br>already been a move away<br>to some extent from<br>globalization sentiment<br>so it is possible that<br>anti-globalization sentiment<br>is likely to be even more more<br>pronounced going forward as a result of<br>this conflict and<br>the impact on our economies<br>um<br>we are seeing that there is possibly a<br>move towards more regionalization<br>of alliances if you like with proposal<br>of u24<br>there is an alliance that is between<br>china and central asian countries so<br>there is this tendency towards creating<br>the regional alliances a little bit more<br>so it would be an interesting area to<br>observe and it might actually have<br>significant implications for new zealand<br>um<br>i guess<br>what this current situation is going to<br>mean in the longer term and how the<br>sanctions are going to on unfold<br>on how this conflict will be addressed<br>and<br>unfortunately even though we're trying<br>to stay<br>linked to<br>economic analysis<br>it's very hard to disconnect the<br>economics from geopolitics these days i<br>guess for us to understand what the<br>further implications will be and how<br>long the sanctions are likely to last we<br>need to probably understand a bit of a<br>nuance<br>behind the conflict and um<br>whether there is actually a purely<br>economic motivation behind the conflict<br>or perhaps other motivations<br>undervalued particularly by those that<br>are not linked to that region is that<br>most of the countries of the former<br>soviet union are not homogenous with<br>regards to the ethnic composition<br>uh yes<br>most countries will have an identifiable<br>ethnic majority but in reality and being<br>very very multicultural<br>and the conflicts amongst ethnicities um<br>not so much amongst ethnicities the the<br>political conflicts and geopolitical<br>conflicts are often actually<br>disconnected from the culture and from<br>ethnic composition<br>so um when we are looking at the<br>current situation between in<br>russia invading ukraine<br>the<br>ethnic understanding and the ethnic<br>appreciation of each of the nations goes<br>way back before soviet union we are<br>talking hundreds of years back<br>so<br>i guess a resolution of a conflict like<br>that uh can often be prolonged and<br>whether there is going to be a long-term<br>peaceful resolution as a result also<br>depends on how um<br>the nations will be able to address this<br>complexity<br>um<br>there is a possibility that we currently<br>have a bit of a misalignment between the<br>economically motivated west because a<br>lot of the time<br>the actions of the western countries are<br>driven by macro<br>economic motivations<br>and potentially at the moment less<br>rational and what appears to be even<br>deontological motivation uh within<br>russia and perhaps even ukraine right<br>now<br>as i said the<br>conflict is not purely about economics<br>there is a lot more that sits behind<br>that conflict that could stand in the<br>way of quick resolution and it could be<br>that<br>the deontological motivation that could<br>stand in the way of the current economic<br>measures and sanctions actually playing<br>a strong enough role to be an effective<br>deterrent for a long-term return to<br>peace<br>um i guess<br>um last thing that i would like to<br>put to you and think about is without<br>considering the current circumstances uh<br>it is still possible to continue viewing<br>global and local economic development<br>independently from geopolitics and<br>whether this sort of thinking um can<br>start inching towards perhaps a<br>reductionist view of the situation<br>um and it it's just a question that i<br>guess i will<br>well thank you very much veronica and<br>that question is clearly there in<br>everybody's minds and it's actually the<br>underpinning question that comes come<br>through all the chat questions so far<br>they're about geopolitics<br>and we can't separate them out from the<br>economic things that we're talking about<br>but<br>so far we've heard um eldridge saying<br>there's some<br>big trade<br>blockage shortage difficulties<br>ahead<br>but grant actually saying there's some<br>financial resilience that's there as<br>well<br>that may not<br>actually hurt russia so much<br>olga's given us a whole lot of<br>background on this and veronica you've<br>been talking about<br>regional alliances one of the questions<br>that has come through<br>is<br>takes that question of regional<br>alliances and says well if you look at<br>it in a bigger world are we heading into<br>a new cold war is there a risk<br>that there could be a new<br>set of alliances between west on one<br>hand and russia china on the other hand<br>and the other is either sitting on the<br>fence or joining the camps<br>in a sort of economic cold war in the<br>future<br>we've heard a bit about the prospects<br>that china could have from<br>either going around some of these<br>sanctions<br>or putting pressure on russia or taking<br>advantage of both sides on this any<br>thoughts from our panel<br>about the risk of a serious big schism<br>that's got economic implications between<br>the west<br>um<br>could i make a comment alan thank you<br>uh<br>yeah i think there's a there's a huge<br>risk of<br>you know<br>regional polarization if you like but<br>i think the the both the west and china<br>because the two big players are here<br>in terms of china and the us<br>this this war<br>really cause<br>a worsening or acceleration of the<br>deglobalization so i just think that<br>both the us<br>and china will tread very carefully<br>and<br>really work hard to try and ensure that<br>there's not a<br>sort of a truncation of trade between<br>the major powers because<br>you know the the huge relationship the<br>sort of symbiotic relationship between<br>the us and china<br>with china's trade surplus<br>and america's deficit with the with the<br>finite with the money financing going in<br>the other direction<br>uh with um you know it's sort of<br>fundamental to where the the global<br>economy is at present so my feeling is<br>that the<br>that they'll try and maintain uh the the<br>international trade<br>that that uh that huge trade link that<br>currently exists between china and the<br>west<br>but that<br>a lot of the sanctions if if chinese<br>companies are seen or caught to be<br>you know supporting russia or breaching<br>the sanctions with russia then they will<br>be punished<br>but there'll be a lot of smoke and<br>mirrors used and a lot of the frontline<br>western oriented chinese companies won't<br>get involved in those that<br>sanction busting<br>but there'll be all sorts of new<br>companies and regional domestic<br>companies in china that do in fact get<br>involved in that sanction busting<br>so i think there's going to be a bit of<br>you know<br>a lot of positioning and things going on<br>behind the scenes that will effectively<br>erode<br>uh the sanctions behind the scenes<br>and of course there's going to be some<br>interesting commercial possibilities for<br>china if they're prepared to sign up for<br>cheap contracts for oil and gas<br>for cheap cereals production<br>if they're prepared to<br>fill some of the gaps that are going to<br>be there for<br>russian imports<br>and if they're prepared to<br>put money into the russian economy and<br>fill some of the gaps of the exiting<br>western country companies around as well<br>i'll go<br>you've worked on a number of these<br>places and you've been at one stage of<br>your career promoting new zealand trade<br>into some of these areas<br>have you got any thoughts about that<br>bigger regional scene<br>yes i do it's pretty much uh<br>along the lines of what grant has has<br>just uh voiced i think<br>there's definitely there's two uh<br>two major players china's obviously<br>bigger but india is making some pretty<br>significant moves as well to take some<br>spaces and<br>they will be invited and will benefit<br>from<br>from the shortages in russia and it will<br>step into that space<br>but i feel like um in in doing so there<br>will be a lot of care and caution<br>applied to not upset some of the<br>balances that exist with the other<br>nations<br>and going back to the question of you<br>know will there be a massive cold war<br>and will there be alliances that will be<br>head-butting for<br>months and years to come i think<br>uh no there won't be and it's one of<br>those invasions and wars where there is<br>one clear<br>culprit and i think um<br>the sentiment that i'm picking up is<br>that you know russia is as sort of an<br>outcast and other countries will be very<br>careful touching that um<br>and being known for alliances but that<br>goes<br>you know under what happens under the<br>surface of the water is obviously much<br>more nuanced there will be deals done<br>and there will be you know humanitarian<br>type i think we won't get into hunger<br>situation in russia i don't think that<br>will ever be the case<br>um but there will certainly be<br>opportunities um of a a major type for<br>example all of<br>you know foreign cars disappearing off<br>the streets of russia china makes some<br>of those<br>so of course they will be invited to<br>participate and if they can do that<br>safely for themselves and their<br>political or sort of macroeconomic sense<br>i think they will<br>um but that doesn't mean that they will<br>go into an alliance and there will be<br>sort of a cold war with major economic<br>implications i think there's grief<br>enough<br>out there and all the major players are<br>seeing volatility and they don't want to<br>exacerbate that that's kind of<br>where i see this<br>thanks so<br>eldridge um<br>you<br>we're talking about supply chain<br>disruption and trade disruption at a<br>time when actually there's a heap of<br>disruption still going on as a result of<br>covert as a result of trump trade wars<br>etc etc<br>and you've got some interesting<br>background yourself originally from<br>zimbabwe zimbabwe has been under<br>sanctions for<br>since<br>roughly year 2000<br>any thoughts from what you've heard on<br>the others<br>on<br>whether or not the question of supply<br>chain disruption blockages decoupling<br>could actually spread into an east west<br>or russia china versus western economies<br>sort of picture<br>i think<br>thank you yeah i do have um<br>it is a background with that exposure to<br>um<br>you know to a zimbabwean economy that<br>was undergoing<br>sanctions<br>i'm not sure if my experience speaks<br>directly to you know the decoupling but<br>it speaks to other elements around you<br>know what sanctions do broadly to to<br>economies<br>so i think what what i<br>managed to to sort of see experience<br>firsthand in some cases vicariously with<br>the situation in zimbabwe especially at<br>the onset you know sort of 2000 to 2004<br>the two or three things that jumped up<br>to me at that time<br>was the fact that it's just generally<br>very difficult to target sanction<br>sanctions you can say we've identified<br>these individuals we've identified these<br>industries we've identified these<br>organizations but the actual targeting<br>of sanctions<br>for purposes of making a real impact is<br>actually a lot more difficult than it<br>looks um in in principle and i think it<br>takes us to a few points that all both<br>orga and grantee have charged on<br>um i think i've granted a very<br>interesting um<br>you know<br>quip on that that you know money will<br>always find its way through through the<br>cracks but the politically connected<br>uh the elites will almost always find<br>their way around systems and be able to<br>second then that so that's one side the<br>targeting of sanctions<br>and their intended impact on certain<br>individuals or organizations there's<br>another dimension to it which is the<br>impact of sanctions so the impact is<br>supposed to go squarely to those that<br>are targeted<br>but in most cases it doesn't<br>um<br>every now and then we see that the<br>impact can actually spread<br>more broadly in the general population<br>can actually affect you know the<br>ordinary man or woman uh on the street<br>and then these are their downstream<br>effects of that<br>so<br>so right if i if i wrap this around<br>these two points together around nicely<br>first thing this notion that elites can<br>circumvent sanctions through very you<br>know intricate and unscrupulous deals<br>and sort of mechanisms behind the scenes<br>and the fact that the common man or<br>woman on the streets on the street gets<br>impacted if you look at those two<br>together you start to see<br>how parallel markets black markets and<br>all kinds of uh informal marketing<br>activity uh starts to mushroom so if i<br>go back to zimbabwe and i don't think<br>russia will necessarily end up in that<br>situation but if you go back to the<br>zimbabwe of 2004 um<br>the column was probably 75 80 percent<br>formal activity this is you know 25 30<br>percent informal it's flipped the other<br>way around now and i think that's<br>predominantly due to sanctions<br>and they are sort of<br>wide-ranging uh effect and the fact that<br>it's very very difficult to have them<br>and veronica um keeping with that<br>question<br>uh you talked about regional<br>economic<br>matters and of course<br>um again it's complicated because the<br>soviet union<br>well the russian<br>empire under the czars was huge the<br>soviet union was big<br>it was ruled for many years by georgian<br>and<br>now<br>since 89 a lot of that's broken down but<br>we're not sure how much it's broken down<br>and clearly in putin's mind the<br>ukrainian connection is broken down too<br>much and needs to revert<br>i understand that in russia russia has<br>actually more migrants from the<br>from outside russia than<br>almost any other country so there's a<br>lot of workers there from the region<br>and<br>we're interested<br>what sort of regional effects that could<br>be from these russian sanctions and is<br>there still a sort of feeling any sort<br>of feeling of economic alliance around<br>the region the what used to be comic-con<br>i suppose the nearest that there is to<br>that now is<br>the eurasian economic union it's got<br>belarus and kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan<br>and armenia<br>in it<br>do you<br>see any comparison to the eu<br>there<br>do you think that's<br>significant in the way people's thinking<br>about the region or is it purely a<br>security and political sort of issue for<br>him<br>thank you for this<br>fantastic question<br>just like any other matters this is a<br>very complicated aspect because again we<br>have economic alliances and i think<br>still quite very a serious dependence on<br>trading with russia russia being you<br>know the neighbor and there being<br>a lot of history with russia over<br>centuries we're talking about not just<br>during the soviet union but also<br>previously which does not necessarily<br>align with agreement with the political<br>structures and the political policies<br>and that's where i guess the dichotomy<br>exists that from the economic<br>perspective it makes sense that the<br>countries continue trading with each<br>other but when the russian external<br>politics starts to i guess affects the<br>sovereignty of the neighboring nations<br>that's where the conflict starts rearing<br>itself so yes there are countries of the<br>former soviet union they are still very<br>much in alignment with um<br>russia's political system if you like<br>and the way they see their future<br>evolving i mean belarus is a very good<br>example i believe kazakhstan and other<br>central asian countries are also quite<br>an alignment there so there isn't this i<br>guess<br>political misalignment to some extent so<br>the trade amongst those countries is<br>likely to continue the economic<br>relationship is likely to continue being<br>quite strong<br>it is much harder for smaller nations<br>like georgia it's only three and a half<br>million people tiny little territory<br>geopolitically extremely important but<br>obviously you cannot possibly compare<br>the strength in any way of what georgia<br>could achieve alone and the neighboring<br>countries and particularly<br>russia being north of georgia so in<br>terms of the migration yes many of the<br>former soviet union i guess represented<br>tubs and we're not talking about<br>ethnicities here we're talking about um<br>against the citizenships<br>um because ethnicities again<br>we are talking about hundreds of<br>different ethnic minorities that live on<br>that territory so people did choose to<br>go to russia because the employment<br>opportunities were probably a little bit<br>better there mind you when the soviet<br>union collapsed russia probably was the<br>least affected economically country<br>of all<br>everybody else and countries like<br>georgia suffered immensely and there was<br>an absolute anarchy for decades after<br>that um so yes the natural tendency was<br>to continue trading with russia to seek<br>out the employment opportunities in<br>russia many chose to move to russia at<br>that point in time and obviously those<br>you know family connections still exist<br>good relationships also still exist uh<br>despite the political orientation and<br>what actually uh happens in place so<br>what i was talking about with regards to<br>migration earlier was an unusual um<br>situation really that seeing the mass<br>exodus of russian citizens into georgia<br>because um well strictly speaking<br>georgia is under sanctions from russia<br>at the moment so georgia can't really<br>trade with russia right now and we<br>that's the follow-on effect of the 2008<br>war<br>but<br>we didn't restrict the incoming um i<br>guess produce or migration from russia<br>into georgia so it's a very easy country<br>to come to at this point in time<br>and i can imagine that um<br>countries where um people enjoy similar<br>freedoms you know georgia is a sovereign<br>nation freedom of speech exists there so<br>that can be an attractive um at this<br>point proposition<br>for uh say russian citizens who feel<br>that they may be constricted in some way<br>or are<br>potentially um<br>well you know just looking for an<br>opportunity to wait out the storm if you<br>like<br>um<br>in terms of the<br>longer term alliances well um in the<br>post-soviet uh union environment there<br>was a desire to create a what was called<br>asenga<br>alliance and it was an alliance of<br>former soviet union nations it was<br>predominantly a trade union and alliance<br>many of the countries opted out of it<br>purely because again the economic<br>alliance cannot be completely separated<br>from the political pressure because two<br>are so closely linked together<br>um so that would probably play a role in<br>what types of alliances will remain or<br>will continue forming around russia<br>so i think that alignment with the<br>political structure will still play a<br>role in whether the alliances will be<br>formed or not and i can imagine that the<br>countries that have struggled to<br>maintain their sovereignty will probably<br>be very cautious about which alliances<br>they will choose to enter into<br>thank you well<br>continuing with that theme<br>um olga<br>um of course the<br>georgian leader you know about was<br>joseph stalin and he was succeeded<br>in the soviet union by somebody born in<br>the ukraine<br>nikita khrushchev<br>and that just shows us how complicated<br>but integrated that region really was<br>there and we all know that the soviet<br>union<br>won world war ii and it did it through a<br>lot of domestic production and an<br>ability to make stuff that it needed to<br>make to<br>not worry too much about consumer needs<br>but to do a huge effort in industrial<br>production pickup<br>is that<br>now you said one of the problems that<br>russia today has is that it's too<br>economically integrated<br>uh is there<br>not still a both a memory of the soviet<br>resilience but also an ability in<br>industrial production to go back and<br>make stuff again that can't be imported<br>i.e to be resilient against the<br>blockages and sanctions that are likely<br>to be mounting it<br>that is a very interesting question i<br>think we're starting to understand<br>the impacts and people are starting to<br>fast forward you know two years three<br>years can we make this in russia that's<br>exactly the question on every industrial<br>ceo in russia at the moment<br>i think<br>the answer is probably yes the<br>resilience is there slightly different<br>circumstances and you know they what you<br>can make under a huge patriotic drive is<br>probably not there when you're not<br>defending your country when you are the<br>aggressor um<br>so i i'm not talking about<br>sabotage or anything like that but i<br>think you know if you look at germany in<br>a war situation and a lot of in the<br>industries within germany there was<br>sabotage there so i think you know there<br>might be an element of reluctance to<br>participate in something like this but<br>obviously you know self um preservation<br>um prevails as well in those sorts of<br>scenarios where you have to live and you<br>have to make something to to drive to<br>work and things like that<br>um i feel like the um<br>the prognosis is probably because of<br>that hyper integration<br>uh we are in a very different scenario a<br>lot of commentators um are mentioning<br>that russia or you know we're back to<br>1990s or we're back to 1950s<br>we're actually in a very very different<br>environment because there has been that<br>era where people have seen what's<br>possible<br>and going back to some of that um<br>you know yellow colored paper for<br>example we've had that for years you<br>know we i grew up in a situation where<br>you know toilet paper was grey<br>you know those sorts of things very very<br>practical we just did not make anything<br>better than that<br>um so you know we there's memories of<br>this and you can make a version of it<br>but i think the at the moment<br>it's it's kind of not geopolitical and<br>it's not economic it's actually<br>psychological probably which is very<br>similar to what happens to russian<br>soldiers at the end of um second world<br>war those that have seen all the way<br>they've been told stories about how you<br>know soviet union was superior and how<br>well lived and they knew how people<br>lived and we had a few famines and go<br>and um<br>a few a few years and um before the um<br>second world war and when they traveled<br>to western europe and went through there<br>and even though it was all destroyed<br>they saw the difference that your living<br>standards<br>and how um they could live a different<br>life and those people when they went<br>back to russia they were sent to<br>concentration camps because they were<br>too much of a threat psychologically to<br>the others to say well there has to be a<br>better way and there has to be a<br>different system and i think the danger<br>now and there's already commentators<br>saying this that<br>people with any memory of abundance and<br>how<br>advanced products could be used<br>will need to leave the country or they<br>will be sanctioned and retaliated upon<br>by the system because the system will<br>want to wipe any knowledge and memory of<br>that to be able to survive and to be<br>able to kind of self-preserve<br>so yes people may be driving a<br>a russian-made truck<br>um but it will be psychologically very<br>very difficult to do that<br>and i think a couple of recent examples<br>i was able to see um or get get evidence<br>of so even russian trucks uh the<br>percentage of componentry that is<br>actually made in the west i think our<br>biggest truck is 30 percentile<br>components so<br>that integration will be nearly<br>impossible too um<br>so to substitute in any sort of<br>reasonable amount of time<br>uh there are some sort of bypasses so if<br>you talk about volkswagen for example<br>there are assembly plants<br>in china and some of the componentry has<br>been substituted so china can make some<br>of it so there may be a flow<br>into russia but i think the main<br>conversation at the moment is about<br>cannibalization sadly um so when you<br>have a 100 airplanes and 10 of them get<br>disassembled to make the other one the<br>other 90 fly<br>those are the realities i think the<br>capabilities are too um<br>incapable of being at the level where<br>you need to be<br>so you can make some products they will<br>serve the function but they will not<br>satisfy the people because they know it<br>can be better<br>um another some things are really<br>outright dangerous so for example<br>pharmaceuticals that's a real real<br>concern<br>well i'll go um there was of course that<br>soviet black joke<br>about the man who worked in the factory<br>for<br>for many years it was a factory that<br>made components for sewing machines they<br>asked him what he wanted for his<br>retirement<br>and he said i'd like a sewing machine<br>and they said you've worked there for 40<br>years surely you've picked up enough<br>pieces to put your own sewing machine<br>together and he said well yes i have but<br>now one of the things of course that no<br>doubt the soviets suffered was an<br>inflated view of life in the west we had<br>grey toilet paper as well for a very<br>long time<br>when we had import licensing and only<br>one producer in new zealand caxton works<br>we had we had it also not as bad but we<br>recall some of those sort of things<br>right at the moment<br>um we've got nato chiefs all meeting<br>we've got pressure being applied by the<br>perhaps a bit unusually britain<br>switzerland and singapore which are<br>these financial hubs where we know<br>there's a lot of russian money and<br>russian property have also come in<br>behind in this and hung together on it<br>but it doesn't necessarily look like all<br>of east asia is behind it grant you've<br>had quite a lot of involvement around<br>east asian central banks and other bank<br>financial matters<br>when you looked at the<br>voting in the u.n for sanctions<br>east asia was by no means all in favor<br>of it and some of them actually voted<br>against it<br>do you think this is going to really<br>change the economic picture around east<br>asia we're looking now at tpp which<br>china has applied to join where we've<br>got oursep which china is clearly the by<br>far the biggest player in<br>we're all wondering about<br>dependence on china from an economic<br>point of view<br>australia has suffered its own informal<br>sanctions as a result of that although<br>interestingly some people are saying<br>china might quietly start buying<br>australian barley again and some of the<br>other australian products and indeed i<br>think australia's terms of trade might<br>go up as a result of what's happening in<br>russia not down<br>but do you think we're really going to<br>see around the asean south east asia<br>sort of picture<br>a<br>confused view a neutral view an<br>anti-russian pro-ukrainian view i get in<br>behind china view<br>what<br>what changes is that going to mean for<br>us and this was another question to put<br>well my experience uh with the asean<br>countries is that they've been<br>increasing<br>uh<br>albeit sometimes reluctant dependence on<br>china<br>china being the driving force in the<br>region<br>and<br>being a driving force that is<br>increasingly<br>making<br>um sitting on the fence a difficult<br>option<br>um<br>now you know so in other words you you<br>you likely to have to get off the fence<br>on one side of the other and from the<br>asean point of view most members<br>it's pretty clear that<br>they they need<br>that relationship with china<br>both from us of a geopolitical point of<br>view and from an economic point of view<br>so<br>yeah i mean i definitely see um<br>the sort of you know deglobalization the<br>regionalization as an important<br>macro trend that's going to continue<br>and so even though the the big blocks<br>are still going to be trading in great<br>volume<br>uh the the the probably the um<br>the asean is going to be increasingly<br>aligned um with china and<br>i don't think they'll be particularly<br>concerned about<br>uh what's happening in the north of<br>china or what trade might be going on or<br>arrangements uh with russia<br>i think they think that that is out of<br>their territory<br>one one other aspect of that is the<br>increasing<br>internationalisation of the yuan<br>which you know china has been<br>promoting for a number of years but not<br>having a lot of success<br>i think they they'll be using this<br>opportunity to<br>progress that by<br>trying to shift the commodity global<br>commodity complex away from a dollar<br>denominate<br>structure to<br>you know having a greater use of yuan as<br>a reserve currency<br>and<br>used for transaction purposes in<br>commodity markets<br>and certainly that now you know china's<br>paying russia and iran and saudi has<br>also agreed to<br>accept yuan and payments for oil<br>shipments to china<br>so<br>you know i think<br>china is it can use this to further its<br>um<br>it's sort of regional<br>block<br>aspirations<br>so grant just another very quick<br>question just come through and chat what<br>does it actually mean when putin says if<br>any unfriendly countries want to buy oil<br>well it i think this was a strategy<br>basically the the ruble has collapsed<br>and so there's<br>really there's no one buying rubles<br>except for the central bank of russia<br>and using the reserves that they have<br>left that are not frozen<br>to buy rubles and prop up the ruble so<br>it was sort of a<br>an interesting strategy of theirs okay<br>we'll get<br>european purchases of energy to<br>buy rubles and so we'll just require<br>that<br>gas<br>sales be paid for in ruble so<br>the trouble existing contracts are all<br>denominated mainly in euros<br>uh you know for the energy going into<br>europe<br>but um so the the more recently the um<br>uh the germans and italians etc said<br>well we're not interested in<br>renegotiating our contracts we're not<br>going to be paying rubles<br>um we're going to continue to pay in<br>euro so<br>whether russia continues to demand that<br>i doubt because<br>either they can accept euros and then<br>the central bank of russia uses them to<br>buy rubles<br>or they get the the<br>western europeans to buy rubles it's<br>sort of a device to<br>help to prop up the ruble<br>but i don't think they'll die in the<br>chopra<br>okay<br>well thank you and we've really come to<br>the end of our time<br>so i'd like to say thanks very much to<br>all the panel members boy we've had some<br>really interesting angles<br>some really interesting thoughts and we<br>don't know the answers on a lot of this<br>and so much of it is going to depend on<br>how long this conflict goes on for and<br>whether or not there's a negotiated<br>settlement<br>a military outcome or a pullback and we<br>know that uh that that<br>sanctions these sanctions could have<br>significant effects but they also could<br>be negotiated away in a negotiated<br>settlement as well those things are<br>possible we're interested in of course<br>and what that means for ukraine what<br>it's going to mean for ongoing russian<br>economic relations and as we've pointed<br>to the big issue in this region is<br>really also going to be what are the<br>side effects on china the belton road<br>which runs through that region<br>and of course the new zealand government<br>will be saying thank god we did apec<br>last year and we're not doing it this<br>year because organizations like apec are<br>going to have a hell of a job working<br>out can they even all sit around the<br>table with russian delegates at the<br>moment anyway<br>there's a huge number of questions in<br>all of this i've learned a lot through<br>this time i hope you have as well we<br>would like very much to thank alex<br>richter<br>charlotte deans<br>carla davidson<br>and the professional programs office of<br>factory university school of business<br>and government<br>so with that we'll leave you all and<br>we will be very interested to hear and<br>learn as this goes forward and let's<br>hope we get a resolution in the ukraine<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
