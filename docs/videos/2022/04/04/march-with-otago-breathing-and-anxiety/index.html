is sheila murray i'm the<br>director of alumni and development at<br>the university of otago and i'd like to<br>welcome you all here this evening we've<br>got great participation<br>uh to this last of our march with otago<br>series which is um<br>tonight with<br>um with dr olivia harrison<br>called breathing and anxiety<br>understanding the miscommunication<br>between the brain and body and how best<br>to treat it<br>um we're very lucky to have um olivia<br>with us tonight and i'd like to just<br>introduce olivia<br>so<br>dr olivia harrison's research focuses on<br>mental health and its relationship to<br>interception and how we perceive our<br>body<br>she uses neuroimaging and compute<br>computational<br>models to better understand how the<br>brain perceives and learns about changes<br>in the body with a particular focus on<br>breathing<br>the work also aims to understand how<br>currently available treat such as anti<br>anxiety medications and exercise can<br>improve conditions such as anxiety and<br>depression<br>um before i first go further<br>introduction could i just remind<br>everybody to please be on mute um then<br>we can that would make it a lot easier<br>for us thank you<br>so olivia is an otago alum we're very<br>proud of her she studied neuroscience<br>and exercise physiology as an<br>undergraduate at the university here and<br>in 2015 she completed a phd at oxford<br>university where her thesis looked at<br>targeted nuclei in the brain stem and<br>cortex thought to be key breathing<br>control<br>thought to be key in breathing control<br>and perception<br>and on completion of her phd she held a<br>post-doc position at oxford for two<br>years<br>in 2018 she moved to zurich where she<br>took a position as a postdoctoral<br>researcher in the translational neuro<br>modeling unit at the university of<br>zurich and held the mari curie<br>individual fellowship until 2020 and<br>whilst here there she investigated how<br>learning and perceiving our bodily state<br>may be altered with psychological traits<br>such as anxiety<br>in 2019 olivia was awarded a rutherford<br>discovery met fellowship from the royal<br>society which saw her return to it to<br>new zealand and to the university of<br>otago<br>in 2021 she was a recipient of a l'oreal<br>unesco for women in science fellowship<br>and this fellowship recognises the<br>achievements of exceptional early career<br>female scientists and highlights the<br>critical importance of ensuring a<br>greater participation of women in<br>science from a young age<br>the funding from these two latest<br>fellowships will support her<br>groundbreaking studies<br>how individuals perceive symptoms of<br>anxiety such as a racing heart shortness<br>of breath or sweaty palms and how their<br>response to this perception can further<br>influence one's mental state<br>so it's our great privilege to welcome<br>olivia here tonight and it's over to you<br>olivia<br>welcome everyone it's such a pleasure to<br>be here<br>my name is olivia harrison and um<br>i hail from christchurch that's where my<br>family is and i acknowledge the mountain<br>rapachi and<br>the river waimakariri for their places<br>um in my life growing up in the<br>canterbury plains<br>but my family history really comes from<br>england and we have a really rich<br>history of moving from england over to<br>new zealand the latest of which is my<br>husband who's from yorkshire<br>so as sheila said i've been on a little<br>bit of a research journey and i want to<br>share some of that with you today and<br>what we've been looking at<br>and so i started my<br>postgraduate or my undergraduate work<br>here at otago i studied<br>neuroscience and exercise physiology a<br>double degree<br>and i was always really interested in<br>that communication between the brain and<br>body<br>then i had the most incredible<br>opportunity to go to the university of<br>oxford to finish my or to complete my<br>phd<br>and there i focused more on<br>specifically respiratory control and i<br>used brain scanning so neuroimaging to<br>understand what's happening in the brain<br>when<br>we're perceiving and controlling our<br>breathing<br>i then wanted to direct this a little<br>bit further into mental health and moved<br>to a group that crossed the university<br>of zurich and eth zurich called the<br>translational neuromodelling unit<br>and there that's a psychiatry group and<br>i really got to embed myself within this<br>world and understand more about<br>anxiety and we incorporated some<br>computational modelling into our work as<br>well<br>and so now<br>i'm bringing completing that loop and<br>have come back to otago with my husband<br>and we're working on trying to bring<br>this all together to better understand<br>conditions like anxiety and what we can<br>so if we think about being worried about<br>something and being really anxious<br>everyone's really different we all have<br>different worries we have different<br>thoughts we have different processes in<br>the brain<br>that we go through when we worry about<br>things<br>and it's really normal to worry about<br>lots of things<br>especially this<br>horrible pandemic at the moment there's<br>lots of things that it's really normal<br>to have this worried reaction about<br>but when we go more into anxiety<br>disorders and when we see about what<br>makes those difference to normal levels<br>of anxiety is that that's they start to<br>become disabling they start to interfere<br>with our lives and they start to stop us<br>doing things and that we want to do and<br>that we want to<br>have as part of our life<br>so our work really is focused on this<br>transition between people who might be<br>susceptible to anxiety disorders and<br>then moving into sort of first diagnosis<br>of anxiety disorders<br>i also have a colleague bruce russell<br>who works on the more severe end of<br>mental health disorders so between the<br>two of us we really try and span that<br>that whole spectrum<br>and if you think about the last time you<br>were really worried about something just<br>anything that you were worried about<br>you might remember those racing thoughts<br>around your head<br>but you might also remember what it felt<br>like to be anxious and to be worried<br>and you maybe had<br>your heart racing in your chest you<br>might have felt your palms become a<br>little bit clammy you might have felt<br>your breathing become a little bit<br>quicker or you might have even been<br>holding your breath<br>and that's what we really focus on and<br>what we um<br>are looking at is how those symptoms of<br>anxiety can end up in our body because<br>we have these thoughts these threatening<br>thoughts and the symptoms themselves end<br>up in our body<br>and what can happen as a result of that<br>is we can<br>interpret or maybe misinterpret those<br>symptoms and that can feed further<br>anxiety because we get worried about<br>these symptoms<br>so my work in this domain really focuses<br>on breathing and we'll take a little bit<br>of a closer look at breathing and why<br>it's important but i want to first place<br>this within the idea of anxiety and how<br>we treat it<br>so we have our wonderful clinicians we<br>have our psychiatrists and our<br>psychologists and our counselors who<br>work on understanding those thought<br>patterns understanding where they come<br>from and trying to treat those those<br>thoughts um as a root of the anxiety<br>and i'm not a clinician i'm a<br>neuroscientist so what we do is<br>alongside that we're really trying to<br>understand what's going on in this these<br>pathways between brain and body<br>and how we can use our work to help<br>provide tools for the clinicians um and<br>things that we can do to help improve<br>treatments or even understand current<br>behaviors so that we arm ourselves and<br>the clinicians with the knowledge of why<br>we might be perceiving things like this<br>or what might be happening to feed this<br>anxiety cycle<br>so we're really trying to work alongside<br>and help um the really important work<br>the clinicians do in this space<br>and<br>if we think about just perception in<br>general you might be much more familiar<br>with the world of extraoception so these<br>are our really five classic senses so<br>touch hearing sight smell and taste<br>and what perception is is it involves<br>taking those signals from each of those<br>senses so it's taking those sensations<br>and perceiving them in the brain so how<br>do they translate from the outside into<br>the inside so that we can make sense of<br>them within our brain<br>and the world i work in is actually<br>interception<br>so just like those<br>extraceptive sensations and perceptions<br>interception looks at signals that come<br>from the body so heart lungs gut<br>things like skin bladder and so even<br>immune responses as well<br>and this is a less studied field than<br>extraception<br>mainly also because it's really hard to<br>study it's very hard to create changes<br>in um in these sensations and then<br>measure the effect of those to do that<br>really safely and securely while we have<br>control over over these symptoms because<br>they're so vital to life it's very easy<br>to change a visual stimulus it's very<br>hard to to very<br>carefully and safely change your heart<br>to say<br>and what we know about interception as<br>well as with extraception is that these<br>signals are really noisy it's not a<br>one-to-one mapping it's not just the<br>signal that comes from the body ends up<br>in the brain and we're able to really<br>accurately perceive that<br>so we know that there's a bit of a<br>breakdown here<br>and importantly we know or there's a lot<br>of theories around this at the moment<br>that this breakdown is particularly<br>important in mental health conditions<br>like anxiety and depression and all the<br>way through to schizophrenia and<br>psychosis<br>and it's also really important in<br>chronic physiological disease so people<br>who have<br>lung disease or people who have chronic<br>conditions like chronic pain<br>and what we know about chronic<br>physiological disease is that it's often<br>paired with mental health conditions as<br>well because it's a lot of hard work to<br>deal with a chronic physiological<br>condition and it means that we have<br>susceptible people who might be<br>suffering from that mental load as well<br>so interception we know um is important<br>in both mental health conditions and<br>chronic physiological conditions<br>so our work has really been trying to<br>understand this and specifically like i<br>said we've been focusing on the<br>breathing domain<br>and this is just one domain of<br>interception it's one channel within our<br>body<br>and the reason i<br>i like it i hope i can convince you as<br>well that it's really interesting<br>is that it's almost about in into the<br>body because all of the other um signals<br>and interceptive signals we have we have<br>very little conscious control over<br>whereas breathing really swaps between<br>that subconscious control when we're not<br>thinking about it and our conscious<br>control<br>and so<br>that also means that we have a way to<br>access inside the body because if we<br>change our breathing it can then flow on<br>and change all of these other channels<br>as well if we want to slow our heart<br>down the first thing we do is take<br>slower deeper breaths so it's a way to<br>basically access all of these<br>interceptive channels so this is where<br>we wanted to start and understanding<br>breathing<br>so to take you through a little bit<br>about how breathing works in the brain<br>you're all going to know me a little bit<br>more than you probably bargained for<br>because this is the inside of my head in<br>my brain scan<br>um and i'm just going to quickly talk<br>you through where breathing control<br>happens and how this interface between<br>subconscious and conscious works<br>so here i've highlighted the brainstem<br>it's low in the brain it's a small part<br>of the brain<br>and it's the connection between the<br>spinal cord below it you can see the<br>spinal cord going out and down my neck<br>and up into the higher brain itself<br>and this part is really responsible for<br>automatic functions it keeps us alive<br>basically it's in charge of our heart<br>rate it's in charge of our blood<br>pressure and it can also be in charge of<br>our breathing when we're not thinking<br>about it so when we go to sleep and if<br>we breathe away without thinking about<br>it or doing something else whenever our<br>attention is not<br>turned towards our breathing our brain<br>but like i said breathing has this added<br>dimension this messiness which makes it<br>so interesting<br>is that<br>it also has conscious control<br>so our conscious perception and control<br>lies in the higher brain which i've<br>circled here so it's sometimes referred<br>to your as your cortex you might have<br>heard it in um mainstream media is your<br>gray matter that means that those gray<br>bits that you can see all around the<br>cortex that's all of our neurons are our<br>cells<br>and this part of the brain is involved<br>in things like intentional movement or<br>decision making anything that we're<br>perhaps consciously aware of or<br>doing with purpose<br>so this can sometimes be involved in<br>breathing say we want to hold our breath<br>because we want to go snorkeling or say<br>we want to change our breathing in a<br>specific way because we're talking or<br>we're singing that's when our conscious<br>percep our conscious control of our<br>breathing can come in<br>and a lot of the work that i did in my<br>phd<br>was actually directly at the interface<br>between these two systems<br>so here we have um somewhere called the<br>midbrain aptly named so right between<br>the brainstem and the higher brain and<br>this is one of the first circuits that<br>we have in the brain that's an almost an<br>alarm center it detects threat and it<br>coordinates our behaviors to respond to<br>those threats appropriately<br>so if we have a threat that we need to<br>run or<br>fight<br>then this part of the brain will<br>coordinate our behaviours<br>so that we can<br>so that we can control our blood<br>pressure and our blood flow to our limbs<br>so that we can be prepared to fight or<br>flight it will change our heart so that<br>we can pump more blood around the body<br>it will change our breathing as well so<br>that we can respond adequately to that<br>and so what i was interested in within<br>my phd<br>was whether or not this threat center<br>could be activated by symptoms from the<br>inside whether we are able to perceive<br>these body symptoms that are involved in<br>lots of different things but things like<br>breathing restrictions whether or not<br>they're enough to really see this alarm<br>center start activating in the human<br>brain<br>so we did this um<br>via breathing resistances<br>because like i said it's really<br>difficult to change things that are<br>happening on the inside of our body from<br>the outside with lots of control do it<br>really safely on and off as we need to<br>and so we chose um the use of breathing<br>resistance most of the time so if you<br>imagine breathing through a really small<br>straw that's kind of what it feels like<br>you can always breathe you've just got<br>to activate your muscles around your<br>lungs a bit harder to draw their air in<br>and it's not particularly pleasant some<br>people find it perfectly fine and they<br>don't worry about it some people find it<br>really really unpleasant<br>and so what we could do using this<br>is to see if um and where in the brain<br>this breathing threat was being detected<br>so<br>first of all here's just a cross section<br>of that higher brain that conscious part<br>of the brain you can see the dotted<br>arrow is about where the slice comes<br>from<br>and then the picture on the right is<br>looking down from the top of the brain<br>onto that slice<br>and all the red areas are the areas in<br>the brain that are more activated when<br>we're perceiving these resistances<br>and all the blue areas are the areas<br>that are less activated when we're<br>perceiving these resistances<br>so this is just one slice one<br>representation in the brain and just<br>showing you that there's a lot of<br>activity this is a<br>pretty scary thing it's something we<br>have to work hard to overcome and even<br>something like a breathing resistance<br>involves a lot of that higher part of<br>our brain<br>but like i said we were really<br>interested in knowing whether or not we<br>could actually see this in the midbrain<br>and that threat center<br>and so here i've just zoomed in on the<br>midbrain for you and we could actually<br>we used a very high strength scanner<br>called a seven tesla scanner and we had<br>really fine resolution and fine detail<br>and we could see that these breathing<br>resistances activated this threat center<br>within our brain<br>so we know that we we do perceive<br>breathing um uh breathing resistances as<br>threatening some people more so than<br>others<br>but this was in healthy people this was<br>trying to understand what's happening in<br>the brain when we use these sorts of um<br>techniques and when we change just a<br>healthy person's breathing<br>so we wanted to really extend this and<br>understand okay what place maybe does<br>this have within conditions like anxiety<br>so this is where um or what i was doing<br>when i was in zurich<br>and we ran a study where we looked at<br>perfectly healthy people we looked at<br>two groups one who had very low levels<br>of anxiety and one who had about average<br>levels of anxiety so these were all<br>people who had never had a diagnosis of<br>anxiety or any other mental health<br>condition<br>and they're very much representative of<br>our sort of average levels and low<br>levels of anxiety so we pre-screened and<br>selected people according to this<br>and we wanted to know<br>can we see this even with different<br>levels of healthy anxiety can we start<br>to see differences in the way that we<br>perceive our body and our breathing and<br>what happens in the brain when we do<br>that<br>so we ran everyone through a set of<br>behavioral tests we ran through a lot of<br>different breathing tests to measure<br>lots of um different aspects of<br>breathing which we'll go through in a<br>moment<br>and then we also put everyone through a<br>brain scanner and ran a different<br>breathing experiment then<br>so what did we find well the first thing<br>we looked at was how sensitive are you<br>to breathing resistances so this means<br>how much restriction do we need to to<br>give before someone is able to detect a<br>resistance there<br>so the stimulus on the left you can see<br>doesn't have very much resistance we<br>haven't had to um pull it in too far<br>whereas the stimulus on the right had<br>needed much more resistance it's got um<br>it's got a much narrower diameter so it<br>means it's much harder to breathe<br>through that tube<br>and we wanted to know were these two<br>groups different and just how sensitive<br>they are because remember we know it's<br>not a one-to-one mapping between the<br>stimulus and the sensation and what<br>happens in the brain that perception<br>so we measured everyone with a task that<br>allowed us to uh quantify sensitivity<br>and what we found was actually our<br>moderate anxiety group had decreased<br>sensitivity so they needed a bigger<br>stimulus to be able to perceive a<br>resistance there and this is potentially<br>counter-intuitive to everyone who's<br>experienced being anxious and<br>potentially thinks that they might be<br>more aware of changes in their breathing<br>and that's where<br>that's where insight comes in<br>so we also as well as sensitivity itself<br>that absolute measure of<br>how how easily you can perceive a<br>stimulus itself<br>insight which is sometimes called<br>metacognition is almost thinking about<br>thinking so<br>it's concerning itself with the process<br>by which people self-reflect on their<br>own performance and how they maybe use<br>that knowledge to regulate their<br>behavior<br>so a really nice analogy i find for this<br>is if you do an exam and you come out of<br>your exam<br>and you<br>can intuitively know before you get your<br>results back how well you did so maybe<br>you came out of the exam and you think<br>okay i think that went okay i think i<br>passed and i think it went okay and you<br>get your results back and it was about<br>right your your self-reflection was<br>quite right<br>but maybe you came out of the exam and<br>you think oh my gosh that was terrible<br>and i totally failed<br>and then you get your results back and<br>actually you did really well and you<br>pass with flying colors then that's an<br>example of having poor insight into your<br>performance you weren't able to<br>accurately assign that confidence and<br>that um<br>that sort of<br>security in your decisions that you've<br>made before or your performance<br>so we measured insight because we want<br>to know actually what happens at that<br>higher level not just how sensitive are<br>you to the information but how do you<br>self-reflect when you've used that<br>information<br>and here we found that our moderate<br>anxiety group had decreased in sight<br>compared to our low anxiety group we<br>measured insight in a number of ways and<br>this maya score is just one way of<br>measuring insight but consistently<br>across our measures we saw decreased<br>insight in our moderate anxiety group so<br>not only do we have decreased<br>sensitivity we always also have<br>decreased self-reflection on that on our<br>performance when we're doing a judgment<br>task on breathing resistances<br>but more than that again we are dynamic<br>beings we don't just have static<br>information that we learn about it and<br>then that's it we're part of a really<br>dynamic and evolving world and what we<br>do often in that evolving world<br>is we make associations and we learn<br>things about the world<br>so say for instance you think about<br>going up the stairs of a really big<br>building so maybe your office is on the<br>fifth floor of one of the buildings<br>and you know that when you get to the<br>bottom of the stairs you you have some<br>idea that potentially by<br>the the third floor maybe you're gonna<br>start feeling your heart beating a bit<br>faster you're gonna start your breathing<br>a little bit more and you already know<br>the associations between a stimulus like<br>those stairs and how you're going to<br>feel within your body<br>so we were really interested in how does<br>this process work in the brain and how<br>is it potentially altered with anxiety<br>is it altered in the way that we're<br>predicting about what's going to happen<br>in the future<br>and here again we saw differences in our<br>two very healthy groups and in<br>particular we saw differences in a part<br>of the brain called the insular cortex<br>you can see a little red blob um or an<br>orange blob in the in the brain picture<br>and what we saw was differences in how<br>people were predicting positive and<br>negative stimuli so negative being those<br>resistances which aren't very nice and<br>positive being when they didn't have<br>resistances<br>so we had differences in the way the<br>brain was predicting positive and<br>negative stimuli between our two groups<br>so<br>even though we measured healthy people<br>we measured very low anxiety and<br>moderate anxiety average anxiety for the<br>population we already got to see a huge<br>number of differences in interceptive<br>processing in terms of breathing right<br>from basic levels of sensitivity through<br>insight and then<br>so now what<br>so we've had a look at understanding<br>perceiving symptoms in the body and<br>health<br>we've had a look at what differences we<br>might have in these perceptions with<br>anxiety<br>and now we want to know how do our<br>current treatments work who do they work<br>for<br>and then maybe how can we improve them<br>going forward<br>so one of the first things we're looking<br>at is anti-anxiety medication<br>and in new zealand if you<br>present to your doctor with<br>symptoms of anxiety they might suggest<br>an anti-anxiety medication called a<br>serotonin reuptake inhibitor or an ssri<br>and that's used really widely in new<br>zealand and we want to know<br>who is this working for and how is it<br>working so we measure<br>clinical participants who are just<br>starting their medication or just before<br>and then up to or beyond six weeks of<br>the medication and we want to see how<br>have all of these perceptions changed<br>and who have they changed for<br>the other intervention that we're<br>considering at the moment is exercise so<br>back to my roots and exercise physiology<br>and everyone knows that exercise makes<br>you feel good and exercise can things<br>like can help with things like anxiety<br>and depression<br>but our job is to try and understand<br>where exactly in these pathways exercise<br>might be helping<br>is it that we are gaining back feelings<br>of control<br>is it that we are less afraid of these<br>symptoms in our body because we have<br>more exposure to them because we're<br>putting them in a positive light and in<br>a really productive sense in an exercise<br>setting<br>and so if we understand this we can one<br>not only inform people a bit more about<br>why exercise helps<br>but we can maybe also think about<br>breaking it down into its components for<br>people who going and joining the gym or<br>going for a run is too big a step at<br>this stage people who maybe anxiety is<br>becoming more disabling<br>how do we create tools from what we know<br>works with exercise to help lead people<br>towards really sustainable choices that<br>can help them for the rest of their life<br>alongside treatments given by our<br>clinicians<br>so i have a wonderful team of people who<br>are helping me um and working towards<br>this goal and on the right at the top is<br>bruce who i mentioned earlier who works<br>on that more severe end of mental health<br>disorders and on the left at the top is<br>my wonderful research nurse faye gorman<br>who's also um<br>a<br>trained counselor and<br>works in this in this field all the time<br>so we're really lucky to have her<br>experience with us and then a group of<br>really wonderful students who are<br>working on different aspects of all of<br>this so that we can try and understand<br>this common goal together<br>and then also this work doesn't happen<br>um on its own this is<br>also part of the huge network of people<br>that i've been working with and continue<br>to work with from oxford and zurich<br>and beyond that as well and to london<br>and europe and the us and all my<br>wonderful sponsors who have helped<br>fund this work so that men make it<br>possible<br>and i just want to finish by<br>highlighting a few things one of which<br>are some of these amazing clinicians who<br>work in this field and who have been<br>doing this for decades already so one dr<br>tanya clifton smith i've heard her speak<br>a couple of times and she's got a<br>wonderful book how to breathe<br>and and these are the people that are<br>working right at the coalface they're<br>doing this all the time and dr clifton<br>smith has a wonderful saying that i<br>think<br>really resonates and it's if in doubt<br>breathe out<br>and i think it really reflects how<br>whenever we get worried or whenever<br>something happens that maybe frightens<br>us<br>our first response is often to hold our<br>breath and hold our breath at the top of<br>our breath<br>and there's actually something called<br>email apnea which means when you read<br>your emails you often hold your breath<br>so it can happen to all of us so it's a<br>really nice phrase to reach for when<br>you're just having that moment that um<br>anxiety might be starting to overwhelm<br>you if in doubt breathe out so thank you<br>to dr clifton smith for that<br>and then i want to finish on a wonderful<br>poem that someone sent me just last week<br>on breathing<br>it's called what took you so long by<br>my brain and heart divorced a decade ago<br>over who was to blame about how big a<br>mess i have become<br>eventually they couldn't be in the same<br>room with each other<br>now my head and heart share custody of<br>me<br>i stay with my brain during the week and<br>my heart gets me on weekends<br>on sundays my heart complains about how<br>my head has let me down in the past<br>and on wednesday my headless all of the<br>times my heart has screwed things up for<br>me in the future<br>they blame each other for the state of<br>my life<br>there's been a lot of crying and yelling<br>so lately i've been spending a lot of<br>time with my gut who serves as my<br>unofficial therapist<br>most nights i sneak out of the window in<br>my rib cage and slide down my spine<br>and collapse on my guts plush leather<br>chair that's always open for me<br>and i just sit<br>sit sit until the sun comes up<br>last evening my gut asked me if i was<br>having a hard time being caught between<br>my heart and my head<br>i nodded<br>i said i didn't know if i could live<br>with either of them anymore<br>my heart is always sad about something<br>that happened yesterday while my head is<br>always worried about something that may<br>happen tomorrow i lamented<br>my gut squeezed my hand<br>i just can't live with the mistakes of<br>my past or my anxiety about the future i<br>sighed<br>my gut smiled and said in that case you<br>should go say with your lungs for a<br>while<br>i was confused the look on my face gave<br>it away<br>if you're exhausted about your heart's<br>obsession with the fixed past and your<br>mind's focused on the uncertain future<br>your lungs are the perfect place for you<br>there is no yesterday in lungs<br>there is no tomorrow there either<br>there is only now<br>there is only inhale<br>there is only exhale there is only this<br>moment<br>there is only breath<br>and in that breath you can rest while<br>your head and heart work their<br>relationship out<br>this morning while my brain was busy<br>reading tea leaves and while my heart<br>was staring at old photographs<br>i packed a little bag and walked to the<br>door of my lungs<br>before i could even knock she opened the<br>door with a smile and as a gust of air<br>embraced me she said<br>what took you so long<br>that was lovely olivia that poem is very<br>um yeah<br>it's very true isn't it so i forgot to<br>say to everybody that um if you want i<br>have a question for olivia please put it<br>into the chat and we will facilitate<br>those questions now and we have a bit of<br>time uh we also have recorded olivia's<br>presentation so it'll be available as a<br>youtube recording and we will send that<br>out to everybody who registered for the<br>um<br>event and also it's available for you to<br>pass on to your friends and family so we<br>have got a good number of questions<br>olivia so we'll get we'll start getting<br>through them so um<br>the first question was have you uh have<br>you have you looked at trauma and<br>epigenetic trauma alongside looking at<br>anxiety fight and flight and its effect<br>on the vagus nerve<br>so we haven't specifically looked at<br>trauma yet we've just looked at the<br>effects of some of those traumas<br>potentially so in those um in those<br>adult levels of anxiety i know there's a<br>lot of work going on in the animal<br>domain and i'm very<br>lucky to work in the department of<br>psychology who have um lots of work on<br>animal models of anxiety and trauma and<br>that real fight or flight effect so it's<br>not something we've specifically looked<br>at but definitely something that other<br>people are looking at great thank you<br>and the following was that the is there<br>she was interested in your thoughts are<br>a possible recovery<br>echo reduction and anxiety for people<br>who have been in for example a car<br>accident or suffer some flashbacks for<br>some trauma and anxiety same for any<br>light and negative experience associated<br>with flying and medical misadventure<br>experience etc things like that<br>yeah that's a really good question when<br>anxiety is linked to a specific thing or<br>a specific event and i want to also<br>preface this discussion by saying i'm<br>not a clinician um and i can only talk<br>to you about the neuroscience side of<br>this um but definitely this really<br>speaks to what i was talking about with<br>learning and those associations we make<br>and that real um difficulty it might be<br>to unlearn some of these learned<br>associations it definitely mean it<br>doesn't mean that it can't happen it<br>just takes a process of unlearning and<br>maybe forming new associations to help<br>with that sort of thing<br>and this this is where maybe our<br>clinicians can really help with tools<br>like medication because sometimes we<br>need to allow the space for relearning<br>so sometimes we need a tool like a<br>medication so that we can<br>actually get in there and learn without<br>those panic and freeze responses that<br>might stop us from relearning new<br>associations so definitely um<br>clinicians work really hard on this but<br>what we know about treatments for<br>anxiety and in particular behavioral<br>therapy so a lot of the work and that i<br>was doing in europe was really<br>fascinating especially in german<br>speaking cultures because the first pass<br>is always<br>behavioral therapy and all of their<br>psychiatrists are also<br>therapists and they're trained like that<br>and what they say is that they can get<br>fantastic um absolutely fantastic<br>results from behavioural therapy with<br>anxiety but these results don't often<br>stick they don't stay long-term and<br>those behaviors come back<br>and so we what we're trying to do with<br>this work is understand how we can maybe<br>come up with tools like breathing<br>exercises and understanding what things<br>like exercise do as a maintenance tool<br>that we can get in there and help to<br>sustain these behaviors so when you<br>learn something new to keep those<br>associations and keep<br>relearning and strengthening those new<br>associations those positive ones without<br>falling back into those anxiety<br>associations<br>okay<br>all right uh next question is do we have<br>a way to measure if someone is thinking<br>consciously versus compared to<br>subconsciously you know um someone's<br>meditating compared to personal<br>suffering email email<br>what do you just call it<br>apnea means to stop breathing yes<br>it's a yeah it's a latin word uh that's<br>really really difficult so if i tell you<br>all to not think of a pink elephant i<br>know what you're thinking about so if<br>you ask someone to not think about their<br>breathing then they're going to pretty<br>quickly think about their breathing and<br>often things like meditation have a<br>focus on breathing because it gives us<br>something to focus on that's really<br>physical and hopefully rhythmical and<br>things like that so there's not<br>currently<br>a way of of measuring this indirectly<br>but what we can do is we can measure the<br>physiological responses so we can<br>measure how someone is breathing and we<br>know that if you're doing if you're<br>breathing potentially more<br>subconsciously it might be more regular<br>might not be interrupted by those sort<br>of conscious interventions<br>so we can measure that and we can ask<br>people<br>and<br>we can put people in the scanner and<br>there's some amazing work of um people<br>being put to sleep with um<br>anesthesia as well and seeing as people<br>move into a deeper deeper state of<br>unconscious what happens in the brain<br>there so there's ways around it as such<br>but it's a really difficult problem um<br>to try and separate that conscious from<br>unconscious level of breathing and<br>that's what i think makes it so<br>fascinating that it can flip from<br>conscious to unconscious so so quickly<br>and so you'd have about a microsecond<br>before someone thought about it<br>fascinating and aligned with that sort<br>of have you looked at the ad meditation<br>and the breath is that sort of thing<br>yes i think this is um exactly where all<br>of this is going and um a wonderful part<br>of this you know um eastern medicine has<br>known about this and worked with us for<br>centuries you know this is we know how<br>powerful the breath is<br>and um it's really just the science or<br>the western science side um putting some<br>numbers to it and maybe starting to<br>believe it a little bit more and think<br>that's where we're at at the moment<br>there is lots of wonderful work on<br>meditation and we know how incredible it<br>is and the previous question um ask if<br>fraser is one of those um<br>experts in meditation and breathing and<br>we know that this is important<br>definitely so what we want to do is<br>really<br>find a place where we're understanding<br>the causes and the effects of things<br>like meditation and we're maybe turning<br>it into slightly different terminology<br>that other people might want to access<br>or might have more of a relationship<br>with turning it into maybe body centered<br>but it doesn't mean that<br>meditation in its current form doesn't<br>work it works for many people but for<br>some people it's not quite so accessible<br>it doesn't sort of it's maybe not<br>as directed as they would like so how do<br>we pull out the roots of that and then<br>adapt it for everyone's individual needs<br>okay um<br>this is the question about it would it<br>be interesting to measure the midbrain<br>activity in people who have had years of<br>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<br>and have lived with resistance<br>yes that's a wonderful question so the<br>work that i was doing in oxford the<br>group over there does a lot of work with<br>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<br>and also with asthma as well<br>and<br>these the the people with this chronic<br>physiological condition so for people<br>who don't know chronic chronic<br>obstructive pulmonary disease or copd<br>is when you start to lose the elasticity<br>in your lungs and the little pockets<br>that help you exchange gas in your lungs<br>and they start to sort of degrade and so<br>what happens is you get a more and more<br>barrel chest as that moves out and it<br>won't contract back properly<br>and what we would see with people with<br>copd is that some people would have an<br>incredible barrel chest and they would<br>have really severe physiological copd<br>and their symptoms might not bother them<br>at all<br>and then you might have someone else who<br>had<br>no visible chest distortion at all<br>and<br>they had very little objective lung<br>degradation so you measured breathing<br>tests and they they seemed almost fine<br>and then yet their breathlessness and<br>their perception of their breathing was<br>absolutely debilitating and they didn't<br>want to go upstairs they didn't want to<br>walk to the leisure box they didn't want<br>to go to the supermarket anymore and<br>it's really this is what we were trying<br>to work on is understanding why that<br>mismatch occurs and who does it occur<br>for because physicians that will come<br>and just look at the neck down<br>would say i don't understand because<br>your your lung damage is very small and<br>so you'll be fine off you go sort of<br>thing but yet that person's life has<br>really changed and it's really becoming<br>very very small whereas someone else<br>yeah with huge amounts of lung damage<br>they would they would be fine and that's<br>that's really depending on how your<br>brain is wired what other things are<br>going on in your life<br>how those perceptual pathways um exist<br>in the physiology of not just your lungs<br>but those connections up to your brain<br>and that's really different for each<br>individual so yes we have done a little<br>bit of work on this and lots more work<br>is going on in oxford and in particular<br>also with asthma too and understanding<br>that everyone no matter what's happening<br>below the neck that does not directly<br>translate to what's happening above the<br>neck definitely<br>so you know um would you need to check<br>for asthma if if an otherwise normal you<br>know what's normal person would<br>volunteer to be given the breathing tube<br>test is that something you would check<br>for um we do check for that yes we don't<br>want to put anyone in there and we<br>definitely don't want to put them in a<br>brain scanner and make it hard for them<br>to breathe if they've had experience of<br>an asthma attack so we're very carefully<br>screened for that and we want people to<br>know what they're in for and everything<br>like that so um severe asthma we sort of<br>keep in a separate category because<br>that's where the physiology and that um<br>perception side start to become a little<br>bit mixed so we're specifically focused<br>on anxiety but the interesting thing<br>about asthma um just like as i mentioned<br>with those chronic physiological<br>conditions is that there is a higher<br>propensity with asthma to have<br>higher levels of anxiety and high levels<br>of depression as well so it's a<br>frightening frightening physiological<br>condition and when it's with you<br>chronically it can um also evoke some of<br>those feelings probably more often than<br>say an average healthy person would so<br>it's something we're very aware of and<br>conscious of that we have potentially<br>quite a big overlap between some of<br>these symptoms and it makes a lot of<br>sense when these body symptoms of<br>anxiety are in our breathing and in our<br>body<br>that might mimic and be very close to<br>symptoms of asthma as well so where<br>those two things overlap is going to be<br>different for everyone but it's<br>something we're very conscious of<br>okay<br>and the line is that question about<br>trauma does any work been done about<br>brain activity of people who are victims<br>of violence you know any fight family<br>violence that kind of violence is that<br>being done anywhere yes there's lots of<br>work that um that is done in those<br>specific areas definitely there's also a<br>lot of incredible work on veterans as<br>well so people who have come back from<br>combat and war and post-traumatic stress<br>that's associated with that because<br>obviously that's a huge amount for your<br>brain to process and then for that<br>threat to be taken away and you put back<br>into normal society it does not mean<br>that your brain just completely forgets<br>about it immediately so there is<br>definitely work in those um other<br>specific areas looking at veterans and<br>things it's not something that i've done<br>but um lots of my colleagues overseas<br>have looked at it<br>okay<br>do you have any tips for how to stop or<br>overcome the immediate fight or flight<br>response when you're in the moment<br>um so again this is from personal<br>experience and as a neurosci and i would<br>i would just direct back to to the<br>wonderful clinicians that we have saying<br>things like if in doubt breathe out and<br>that definitely helps me that very first<br>thought when you go oh god why can't<br>the world is closing in a little bit<br>it's just a very slow breath out but<br>that is that is coming from from our<br>so this is a comment about looking at<br>some of the chronic pain work that's<br>coming out of noise in australia graded<br>exposure helping the brain to<br>de-threaten<br>chronic pain and chronic anxiety which<br>is very similar<br>yes yeah so that's just a comment really<br>so there must be<br>i think<br>also worth touching on there is that um<br>some of this is already being done in<br>new zealand and some of the wonderful<br>work by our cutter<br>so i've talked to parents whose children<br>spend 10 minutes every morning doing a<br>heart on the window because ha is breath<br>so learning to breathe out on the window<br>and control<br>and then make that is something really<br>positive and something that you have<br>control over just as a tiny wee tot so<br>these sorts of things are happening it's<br>about<br>celebrating those and<br>bringing them into the light so that we<br>can we can utilize them more more in<br>mainstream so some of this work is is<br>already 100<br>there okay<br>have you looked at how we can train us<br>our subconscious to breathe better over<br>time<br>uh yeah that's a really that's a really<br>good question i think um things like<br>exercise and um having that really<br>rhythmic um understanding of it and what<br>we know about things like exercise is<br>exercise helps us with that um<br>separating our fight and flight and our<br>rest and digest system so we have that<br>fight flight<br>it's called sympathetic nervous system<br>it means that we're um ready to go<br>um running up the stairs doing all of<br>these sorts of things and the opposite<br>of that the flip side is called our<br>parasympathetic that's our rest and<br>digestion slow system and even though<br>when we exercise we push ourselves into<br>that<br>active system what it does is it helps<br>separate it so that we can come back and<br>have more time as well in that slower<br>system because it sort of contrasts the<br>two and the more time we spend in that<br>slower system<br>the more our automatic breathing rhythms<br>come back to something a little bit um<br>slower and a little bit deeper and a<br>little bit more regular so activities<br>that plenty of us are already doing that<br>we know are good for us this is just<br>sort of one of the reasons why so things<br>like exercise for sure things like<br>meditation<br>and things like that<br>and i think um one of the one of the<br>things that i always recognize when i'm<br>stressed is i start to sigh a bit more<br>and you have a sort of big deep breath<br>when you sort of maybe your brain's<br>wearing and you have a big deep breath<br>and then you let it out and it's almost<br>your subconscious way of saying hang on<br>let's just have a moment and reset and<br>that's what some of the theories around<br>size are as well as obviously tired like<br>yawns and things like that but a sigh is<br>our body's way of going we've gone a<br>little bit fast we've sort of um<br>got out of sync a little bit so can we<br>start to reset this system<br>so that might be one indication that<br>maybe that subconscious is is a little<br>bit out of sync with what's happening in<br>the body and that sighing a little bit<br>more is always one of my indications<br>that i need to maybe just step away from<br>what i'm doing not very good at it but<br>do you know if there's been any work<br>with breathing to assist or even<br>possibly prolong the life of people with<br>pulmonary fibrosis which<br>we understand is something that is<br>currently untreatable and incurable<br>i haven't done any work in that domain<br>and that um not something i know<br>anything about um but it is yeah a<br>really debilitating condition um and<br>yeah all around the lungs that is<br>a lot of the physiotherapy work is based<br>around this in the first instance for<br>sure it's not something i'm not telling<br>most of the clinicians anything they<br>don't know definitely it's already in a<br>lot of our practices it's more i'm<br>trying to make those connections with<br>the brain and understand um how we<br>perceive what's going on as well<br>yeah<br>and there's comment here about new<br>zealand research on trauma and the um<br>epi genetic trauma in maori population<br>after colonisation trauma explains so<br>much of the health inequities in maori<br>and pacifica populations<br>yep so do you want to just comment on<br>that or yep no i um something i'm<br>particularly interested in we have a phd<br>student a maori phd student who is<br>working on this and um a really<br>difficult area to work in and something<br>that will take a lot of time and a lot<br>of<br>careful<br>cultural sensitivity and cultural<br>competency to work in properly so i'm<br>working with<br>some of my colleagues in kohatu and the<br>medical school and just learning about<br>this as a pakeha new zealander having<br>recently returned from overseas this is<br>something that i'm really passionate<br>about understanding more um<br>and it has work in particular is around<br>um intergenerational trauma and the work<br>of or the effects of colonization and<br>how that now potentially results in a<br>lot of our health inequities that we see<br>in our current system so it's something<br>we are really passionate about and<br>something that we are working through as<br>carefully as we can and yeah so that's<br>mitchell one of my<br>medical students who's also doing his<br>phd i'm really excited to see where that<br>goes and what we can do in that space<br>thank you<br>what do you think of the nasal breathing<br>movement and you know mouth typing<br>yeah it's i um it's a the wonderful um<br>the wonderful book on um on this that<br>came out um<br>about um yeah i kept the for the life of<br>me i've got the memory of a sieve um the<br>journalist's name has disappeared but um<br>yeah we do have the book in our house<br>and have read it i think a lot of my<br>family have read it and and what he's<br>done is it nesbit james nesbit<br>and and um what he's done so well is<br>he's researched a lot and he's turned it<br>into terms that we can understand and<br>he's really taken a look at the medical<br>side of things as well and there is a<br>lot of truth to<br>the differences between nasal and mouth<br>breathing so even in terms of just the<br>physiology of your nose we have ridges<br>in our nose we have um<br>lots of different<br>humidification systems and purification<br>systems in our nose that are much more<br>developed there than in our mouth<br>because our mouth is also responsible<br>for drinking and eating<br>and it's got a big tongue in the way so<br>our nose is really our filtration area<br>and so utilizing that nasal breathing<br>can help cleanse and humidify because if<br>we have dry air that can be really<br>irritating as well and so we know that<br>nose breathing is really important in<br>that respect for lots of different um<br>lots of different ways of cleaning and<br>making sure the air is ready to exchange<br>oxygen and remove carbon dioxide in our<br>lungs um but what's also important is<br>that nose breathing is a little bit<br>harder because it's a smaller orifice<br>and so it's much easier to breathe<br>through our mouth and so<br>nose breathing um is often you know the<br>path of of greater resistance and so we<br>don't particularly want to do it maybe<br>especially if you've got something like<br>um a<br>um deviated septum or something or a<br>small nasal cavity or you get really<br>blocked up sinuses so there is<br>definitely a huge part of it does need<br>to have a pathway that's trained that<br>you have you're able to take that path<br>of slightly greater resistance and<br>utilize all of those um<br>all of those wonderful aspects of your<br>nose to help with this um because for<br>lots of us habits mean that we just open<br>our mouth and breathe through our mouth<br>because it's a little bit easier so<br>there's a lot of truth to that<br>definitely in terms of the medicine and<br>the physiology of it<br>but if you have anything wrong with your<br>nose please talk to a doctor i'm not a<br>doctor<br>so a question about um lots of people<br>with anxiety and breathing pattern<br>disorders uh in concussion rehab um and<br>the brad cliff techniques are really<br>useful in this space is there any<br>research work being done on the injured<br>brain in this area<br>no actually so breadcliff that was um<br>those techniques are uh exactly from um<br>tanya clifton smith as well they've come<br>up with those like brad cliff techniques<br>um definitely there's there's a huge if<br>you're having a brain injury can um<br>disrupt some of those automatic<br>breathing patterns depending on where<br>the brain injury is or some of the<br>secondary effects of those it's not<br>something that i've done any particular<br>work and it's brain injury is is really<br>taking off in new zealand especially<br>with<br>more research into<br>sports such as rugby which we now know<br>has many more repercussions than we<br>potentially thought um it's been going<br>in america and canada for quite a bit<br>longer because they have american<br>football and ice hockey<br>which are very obvious concussion risks<br>as well so it's not an area that i've<br>worked in but definitely something um<br>really important and with brain injuries<br>also do often like other physiological<br>conditions also have higher loads of<br>anxiety and depression because it's very<br>difficult to<br>okay would you be able to expand on<br>intercessors mr sorry james nestor thank<br>you someone in the comments jane bridge<br>james i just sent you the name are they<br>yes james nestor and it's the author of<br>breath thank you you've helped my poor<br>memory you were close<br>it was close i always want to call him<br>music<br>the question is around could you expand<br>on interception and how it differs from<br>mental health disorders such as anxiety<br>and depression to those<br>such as schizophrenia and bipolar<br>so um<br>interception is that interception is<br>just like um perceiving symptoms from<br>the body perceiving signals from the<br>body so that's just the sort of um<br>perceptual pathway we're looking at just<br>like um extraception so those are um<br>hearing and vision and smell and all of<br>those sorts of things interception is<br>just that pathway there all we know is<br>that um it's really involved in mental<br>health conditions and it's likely<br>involved differently in conditions like<br>anxiety and depression to conditions<br>like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder<br>but the theories that we currently have<br>within psychiatry are that it is<br>involved in all of these different<br>conditions in particular as well<br>conditions like autism<br>and so a host of different things but<br>there are many ways that interception<br>could be disrupted it could be in those<br>predictions that we're making um about<br>the future it could be in that insight<br>um area that we have that<br>self-reflection it could be on just<br>perceiving those signals so down on that<br>sensitivity level and it could also be<br>things a little bit as well more dynamic<br>in that learning domain how we perceive<br>errors when we get it wrong so if we<br>expect something to happen and then<br>something happens that we don't expect<br>how do we process and learn from those<br>errors to now have better predictions<br>about the future so we have multiple<br>different theories across all of these<br>mental health conditions and we're<br>really only in the beginning stages of<br>starting to investigate that<br>in my areas particularly in things like<br>anxiety and depression but um<br>the group that i worked with the<br>translational neuromodeling unit in<br>switzerland also have a big focus on<br>schizophrenia<br>and psychosis as well as does um my<br>collaborator bruce so that work is<br>definitely going on but interception<br>itself is as a really new field it's<br>only just we're in sort of the<br>theoretical stage and then a few of us<br>are trying to put this in motion and<br>measure it and breathing is one of those<br>avenues that we can actually measure it<br>because we can change it and when then<br>we can measure it but there's also lots<br>of work going on in the cardiac domain<br>as well<br>less<br>changing um changing heart<br>and changing heartbeats but more reading<br>those signals and<br>using those signals in different ways<br>so there's lots of theories and um where<br>lots of people are investigating that<br>okay<br>all right we're coming to the end we've<br>got one last question i think and then<br>we can wrap it up so this is about there<br>seems to be an increasing number of gen<br>zetas being diagnosed with anxiety and<br>would you have any idea as to why this<br>particular generation has such a high<br>rate of young people with this condition<br>is it at which people consume media or<br>is there something found for research<br>you've got done that could give some<br>insight<br>it's a really wonderful question to uh<br>to finish on um<br>i think there are a number of things<br>that are contributing uh to our higher<br>rates of anxiety some of them positive<br>some of them less positive the first<br>thing is that i think we're talking<br>about it more and that's a wonderful<br>thing that's something that's come out<br>from the closet and it is starting to be<br>talked about like it is part of so many<br>people's lives so there's where that<br>taboo around talking about mental health<br>i think is starting to lift so that's<br>part of the reason we're seeing more<br>anxiety<br>the other reason i think is what happens<br>evolutionarily is that big changes<br>happen in the world and then our<br>coping mechanisms take a little bit<br>longer to catch up because<br>we you know it used to be tigers and<br>lions we had to run away from and then<br>the world has evolved since then but<br>we our coping systems lag behind things<br>that have happened and if you think<br>about the last 10 to 20 years and the<br>absolute explosion of the internet and<br>social media and our constant access to<br>really bad news and that's now been<br>really compounded with things like a<br>pandemic so there's been a lot of<br>accessible bad news in the last sort of<br>10 to 20 years and we have this young<br>generation of people who have gone<br>through<br>a really really susceptible time when<br>they're young adults so children and<br>young adults growing up in a world that<br>feels very uncertain and i'm from<br>christchurch you know we went through<br>earthquakes and then there was um<br>terrorism and now there's these<br>pandemics and you can just see in the<br>young children that are coming through<br>some of the effects of all of this<br>compounded trauma because<br>many of them don't trust even the ground<br>that they stand on that it will stay<br>stable and keep them safe so there's a<br>real combination of multiple things and<br>i think we might see the effects of this<br>pandemic for quite a long time um and<br>the the on flow of that and i'm just<br>trying to be part of that movement to<br>help us improve those coping mechanisms<br>and help us catch up a little bit faster<br>lovely<br>thank you so there's been some lovely<br>comments about how wonderful your<br>presentation's been olivia people have<br>really loved it this has probably been<br>the most questions we've had in all<br>three of the<br>the
