Discovered in 1986, high temperature superconductivity can generate large magnetic fields and carry electrical current in something thinner than paper. New Zealand has been at the international forefront of moving this technology rapidly into commercial application. At a time of climate crisis this technology is needed more than ever. <br><br>Paihau-Robinson Research Institute focuses on accelerating the implementation of superconductivity into applications such as generators, motors, power transformers and high field magnets. Unlocking the potential of superconductivity requires multidisciplinary expertise to engineer solutions through understanding the physics and materials science. <br><br>In his lecture Professor Rod Badcock outlines the engineering journey he and his team have taken to make the impossible possible. This includes partnering and application, developing new talent, and removing engineering roadblocks. He also shares some of the creative young minds who are solving this endeavour with them and are making their own stand in the world.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

leadership team<br>and our broader public Community to the<br>in augural lecture of Professor Rod<br>Badcock I'm Jonathan wior acting Vice ch<br>taring aaka Victoria University of<br>Wellington Professor Badcock joined the<br>University in<br>2014 as principal engineer of pyo<br>Robinson Research Institute with this<br>being when the Robinson itself became<br>part of the<br>University he's been in the leadership<br>role of deputy director since<br>2017 maintaining a very strong<br>commercial Focus to engineer ideas and<br>new thinking into application he was<br>2021 now I'm not somebody whose work<br>spans engineering physics and Material<br>Science but I do think of Rod's work as<br>being Renaissance in nature with his<br>team's focus on the birth of new ideas<br>and really intense activity across this<br>span of disciplines Rod's known for his<br>multidisciplinary knowledge his<br>capability and his enterprising<br>Spirit now just one example of his work<br>is in electrifying and decarbonizing<br>transport including proposing managing<br>and developing the build of an electric<br>motor strong enough to power<br>airplanes now this is the type of<br>Cutting Edge work that attracts and<br>includes companies like a New Zealand<br>for instance and it's also of course the<br>type of work that means that Professor<br>Badcock has been a key player both<br>nationally and in international<br>Partnerships particularly I think across<br>the Asia Pacific as well as Cambridge<br>and the Massachusetts Institute of<br>Technology but Koto changan University<br>among others all of those types of<br>relationships have yielded PhD<br>agreements commercial contracts and new<br>funding<br>opportunities everything I know about<br>rod and have read about him suggests<br>that he's a superb collaborator with<br>overseas colleagues in his research<br>papers and coner conference<br>presentations Roger work is<br>exceptionally well known and it's highly<br>influential but more than this I think<br>about your work as generative and<br>forward-looking and I think we clearly<br>see this in the power of Rod and his<br>team's translational research but I<br>think we also see it just as much in<br>Rod's close mentorship of undergraduate<br>and postgraduate students and colleagues<br>at all stages of their careers just as<br>much as we see it in any individual<br>research<br>agenda we often talk about people's<br>responsibilities to the Next Generation<br>and I believe Rod's a role model here<br>many of his students and mentees and now<br>respected experts in their own right in<br>their own Fields working for the likes<br>of open star rock lab high-profile<br>European startups or they're continuing<br>their Journey here at the Robinson<br>Institute now tonight it's Rod's work on<br>what I think is the fascinating<br>phenomenon of<br>superconductivity that's the focus<br>superconductors essentially materials<br>that conduct electricity with zero<br>resistance most often still when at very<br>low temperatures can create an extremely<br>powerful magnetic field<br>think MRI machines particle accelerators<br>and so on now as Rod will describe<br>unlocking the potential of<br>superconductivity can facilitate a whole<br>range of new applications including<br>clean sustainable energy<br>production Rod noted in the inaugural<br>invitation though that it's the people<br>that it's the multidisciplinary teamwork<br>that helps make the impossible possible<br>and he'll talk about that as well<br>tonight I understand what he said in<br>that invitation but I think also think<br>that his phrasing around people speaks<br>with Great Gusto to Rod's generative and<br>collaborative<br>style aari rodock it is my great<br>pleasure to introduce Professor Rod<br>to now thank you Vice Chancellor thank<br>you asan and all of the people here<br>tonight who know the door is locked that<br>means you can't<br>escape I have you in my grasp here for a<br>little while<br>and I am going to be talking a lot about<br>the people and on this journey and<br>there's going to be a fair number of<br>people here tonight who are going to be<br>shocked to see that I had photos from<br>when they were doing honors work when<br>they were doing other things and they're<br>tonight so just a bit about pyo Robinson<br>Research Institute so we are well known<br>we're a University Research Institute<br>we're proud to be part of Victoria<br>University our research students learn<br>through doing they do it in a<br>world-class R&amp;D environment and they get<br>embedded with Commerce and our alumni<br>are globally sought<br>after our values and our<br>goals are very much for a sustainable<br>future you could say super Technologies<br>for a cool planet<br>we cover more than just one area of<br>superconductivity we are active across<br>the whole electromagnetic<br>spectrum and it's one of the strengths<br>we bring to<br>bear now I promise you I haven't got too<br>much in the way of complex science<br>tonight I wanted everybody to be able to<br>engage but I'll just explain what superc<br>conductivity<br>means now it enables us the superc<br>conductivity enables us<br>to have very high electrical currents if<br>you think about your house is a 60 amp<br>circuit breaker that's sitting on the<br>pole outside well we want to go to<br>thousands of amps you're thinking about<br>transmitting current into something<br>which doesn't dissipate power it doesn't<br>generate heat so it doesn't cause<br>Transformers and machines to degrade in<br>the way a conventional wound machine<br>behaves<br>it is a cryogenic<br>technology and that means that if you<br>think about the temperatures as you can<br>see on the graph there it's important<br>that the super conductivity that we work<br>with operates and when we can use air<br>almost nitrogen from the air as one of<br>the refrigerants in a closed cycle and<br>that means that we can operate<br>sustainably and<br>renewably why it allows us to be comp<br>impa lightweight electrical machines<br>they're efficient with increased<br>functionality it's<br>common you don't even realize that<br>you're engaging with superc<br>conductivity nearly every day around the<br>world in this city an MR system you may<br>go for a scan super conductivity<br>materials characterization in the<br>university in the commercial research<br>Labs you're engaging with super activity<br>in<br>NMR all the way through to the Large<br>Hadron<br>Collider and there are millions of<br>kilometers of this type of<br>superconductor around in machines and in<br>the system around the world there's a<br>applications but where is our journey<br>and where did my journey come<br>from so actually the origins are with<br>the world for the world patent inventors<br>of one of the most commercial forms<br>bisco and actually that comes down to<br>Bob<br>Buckley who I'm going to embarrass<br>horribly here and Jeff Talon who I'm<br>also going to embarrass horribly at the<br>back there who were the team that was<br>backed by Bill Robinson at dsir who<br>supported them who who helped them take<br>what they were discovering and drive a<br>vision and it's an important vision<br>and I personally want to thank Professor<br>Bob Buckley because actually what he<br>taught me when I started with this team<br>and his focus on Mission oriented<br>research where you actually drive<br>towards an application is something that<br>is with me and is with all of my<br>students now who have graduated are<br>graduating and are working through that<br>that's something that you really should<br>so we still follow his mission oriented<br>approach it's R&amp;D with a<br>purpose the team spun out<br>hds10 they're world class very few<br>people realize there's a company in<br>lower Hut who manufacture super<br>conducting magnets and ship them all<br>around the<br>globe and he brought me in to engineer<br>into practice this smart idea that uh<br>Nick and himself and a few other us from<br>the team had bound rubal cable and they<br>wanted to be able to make it and make it<br>at a scale that was commercially viable<br>I'll just point out that both Bob and<br>Jeff jointly received the inaugural<br>prime minister science prize the very<br>first time it's awarded was awarded to<br>you so what was the challenge that I was<br>faced with the challenge back there that<br>um was how do we make winding cables how<br>can we make a cable that we can make a<br>generator from that we could make a<br>motor that we could make reduce the<br>footprint how can we make it more<br>efficient higher power lighter how do we<br>take what is shown here as a very<br>thin material so I'm zooming in it's<br>like for those of us old enough to<br>remember remember those audio and video<br>cassettes it's just a one or two Micron<br>layer of ceramic a ceramic material<br>that's<br>brittle that's just being supported on a<br>metal tape and that very thin layer we<br>needed to make something that could<br>carry even more current and we could<br>wind<br>that so how on Earth do we do that and<br>how on Earth do we grow the capability<br>so all of a sudden this is not a a<br>physics problem purely of a<br>superconductor it isn't a material<br>science problem of how do you make the<br>material better this is one that en uses<br>all of the engineering how do you shape<br>it how do you make it how do you<br>actually make the material behave in the<br>way you want as a cable and one of the<br>other great things that Bob told all of<br>us was you work and<br>partner and Nick and Bob brought us in<br>partner ship with seens as an end user<br>who pulling the technology towards those<br>application and what you're seeing on<br>the those images is this is the rubal<br>cable wound supplied from New Zealand<br>tested by Seamans this is their<br>generator test<br>coils were made in New Zealand supplied<br>to<br>Seamans so we partnered and drove that<br>development we transferred that to<br>General Cable superconductors this is<br>the other side of the coin that was<br>instilled with us Mission oriented<br>research transfer into<br>application those are strong lessons and<br>we brought the New Zealand supply chain<br>with us it started off Seaman with DC<br>Ross who are probably one of the most<br>superlative fine engineering fine<br>blanking companies in the world and we<br>brought them in and they engaged<br>directly with us and it grew their<br>Horizons and what the technology was<br>capable of we gave them the<br>confidence and we had outstanding<br>results to give you an idea though as I<br>said it's not just<br>about the engineering it's not just the<br>material science we had to use physics<br>to image the quality of the material<br>coming out of Manufacturers overseas of<br>these types of conductors so we had to<br>look at the physics we had to image<br>currents that were circulating with<br>magnetic field SE sensors and we had to<br>build these you this is not an<br>instrument you can buy off the shelf or<br>a process that you could do we had to<br>develop that real to real processing we<br>had to implement it and qualify the<br>material we had to shape the tape and<br>there you can see Kent<br>Hamilton I'm just seeing if I'm going to<br>embarrass Kent now when he he was a much<br>younger man driving one of the the first<br>machines and then we had to wind the<br>cable now I did The Impossible back then<br>the uh amay's engineering project prize<br>used to only go between Canterbury and<br>ockland Lan worked with me from weltech<br>he won that<br>prize and he won it working on the rubal<br>co able winding machines with us he<br>deserves it Lan is now um the r&amp;t<br>manager at retail links you haven't<br>heard of retail links but you do know<br>the companies who make all of the um the<br>the woodf fired heaing systems the power<br>the pellet systems and he designs and<br>does that he's gone through a background<br>now of working in robotics in Forestry<br>at dce where he was the engineering<br>manager there and he's the R&amp;D manager<br>now at retail links and he deserves that<br>because he reduced something from<br>complexity to Simplicity with<br>us and it was a team<br>outcome it used students local companies<br>Myriad engineering lot of the Hut Valley<br>and it use staff and it encompasses the<br>whole multidisciplinary nature and if<br>I've got a few videos embedded for<br>everybody here so you can see how this<br>works what do you are looking at there<br>will be some zoom in on this shortly you<br>are looking notice for the spools of Des<br>spoing and maintaining tension and<br>they're maintaining<br>orientation and they're traversing<br>around each<br>other starts to become complex this<br>isn't like string being Twisted into<br>rope you have to keep this flat so you<br>see how it phades off see they're coming<br>off straight rotating<br>around so this is uh to any mechatronics<br>student they realize this is quite<br>interesting<br>automation this is automation you<br>wouldn't normally see this is what it<br>looks like looking up along the spores<br>you can see the strands passing and<br>we're going to take that material and<br>we're going to wind it in like this so<br>and this was achieved by working as a<br>this so what next okay so we supplied<br>cement we engineered the material we<br>solved the challenges in how do you<br>qualify it and assess<br>it but doesn't stop there that's another<br>thing Bob taught us is well how do you<br>get it out there the team ephos has been<br>applying it out in the<br>world get it out there make it<br>work so how do we join cables well so<br>all of a sudden you've got all of these<br>conductors how do you join them together<br>how do we manage AC loss so any<br>conductor want to see an AC loss how do<br>we wind a motor how do we put it in<br>there how do we restrain the windings<br>how do we power the windings we're<br>starting to get more and more<br>questions and actually Nathan or press<br>on the top right there he's a key<br>engineer with Callahan he started with<br>us as a project student as an honors<br>project from can he was with us working<br>on this<br>contributed massive contribution to what<br>we were doing around the soldering<br>processes then worked as an intern with<br>us actually helped solve the challenges<br>for the next thing I'm going to to talk<br>about<br>but where do we get those people skilled<br>to do this now ratu is going to be<br>feeling embarrassed because I managed to<br>find a photo of him not long after his<br>uh he was on his owners project ratu<br>matara is in the audience here so I'm<br>everybody will now look at you ratu and<br>he looks very youthful there he's just<br>finishing uh his PhD in physic PhD his<br>degree in physics at at<br>Victoria and he got energized with<br>working with us in the Institute he<br>contributed to a number of things we<br>sent him to our collaborators over in<br>the US who manufactured superconductors<br>back so we knew we had to grow the<br>skills base you can't pick these people<br>off a tree you have to grow them you<br>have to grow that capability<br>ratu's been through quite a journey with<br>us but he's not the only one so is Loy<br>so is Kent so is Mike<br>Davies many of the people in the team<br>and I'm I'm looking to see if Gus is<br>here because I'm going to embarrass you<br>next but we have to grow them but we<br>have to collaborate with the best and<br>you'll look along that line of companies<br>there and you'll say hm collaborating<br>with lmer engineering who llama llama<br>win<br>build the performance engines that have<br>won nearly every class of Motorsport in<br>New Zealand over the last few years they<br>have made the the engines and the<br>systems that are winning in Australia<br>but Mark is a humble engineer who did<br>his apprenti ship with Air New Zealand<br>he worked with us when he was previously<br>with Callahan before he sent his he went<br>on his own to form his engineering<br>company that does this he's<br>humble but he's incredibly gifted and<br>we'll show you some of the things that<br>he's<br>produced as well as General Cable<br>superconductors DC Ross he stands<br>alongside some of our suppliers who have<br>grown with us Fab Solutions when we<br>started working with them there were<br>free people and they made canoes and<br>they made um parts for motorcycles<br>now they Supply cryogenic Composites and<br>cry Corners all around the world they're<br>part of the NASA Luna Mission and it's<br>because you stand with them and hold<br>their hand when they when they approach<br>a challenging problem that gives them<br>the confidence and that's how we've<br>grown again thank you<br>Bob under Bob's Tut delicious how we've<br>grown some of these companies they've<br>grown their capability and they've gone<br>off on their own Journeys and their own<br>sorry but I think it's important to<br>think about some of the students that<br>have been through us that I've<br>interacted with directly while they've<br>been studying I haven't got everybody I<br>have got some nice young photos of<br>people like uh Gus who actually is that<br>young fellow here and anybody who knows<br>him now who's finished he's finished and<br>awarded here he's going to be awarded on<br>the Wednesday evening ceremony at<br>Michael Fowler as part of the Mari Tanga<br>service he's now an expert in his own<br>right we sent him to Cambridge with our<br>collaborators at the start of his<br>PhD we sent him alongside s ratu and Gus<br>both went to camers University studied<br>under our close collaborators learned<br>everything think they could teach them<br>about electromagnetic field modeling and<br>they came back with Mark anley telling<br>us they show me how to do stuff now so<br>Zealand Kent Hamilton joined us as a<br>fresh graduate he's then done a master's<br>he's actually just submitted his PhD<br>he's been St he's been doing his PhD<br>parttime on the motors and systems<br>we look around this these people here<br>they're all in positions these are all<br>people who prior to their involvement<br>with Robinson didn't know about how you<br>could apply super activity and they<br>become our envoys out in the rest of the<br>world many of them have very<br>high-profile positions and organizations<br>world so where do you apply it we said<br>we made the cable so let's CH let's<br>attack a problem and one of the biggest<br>team<br>problems was a grid<br>Transformer it's an industry<br>problem that we challenged ourselves<br>with because it meant more than just the<br>superconductor the superconductor<br>engineering is that much of the problem<br>the cryogenic system the Composites the<br>way you interconnect the way you call it<br>for it to operate to to meet the<br>electrical specification to survive the<br>insulation<br>to do that is a huge challenge to do<br>that we had to bring the companies along<br>with<br>us but the advantage is smaller lighter<br>more efficient and we did it with a<br>world record in the current in the<br>Transformer and we showed that actually<br>the utility of the robo cable could be<br>applied to these sorts of machines and<br>that is the this is one of the phases<br>Transformer where to from there well<br>obviously we want to see it being used<br>it's part of the mission part of what<br>we're<br>about so we worked with the Chinese<br>railroad construction company who do the<br>highspeed bullet chains in<br>China and it was a national project and<br>we showed that you could design that<br>form of that form of Transformer in a<br>way that you could<br>double the um effective payload on those<br>trains or increase the speed major thing<br>reduce the volume reduce the mass raise<br>the<br>efficiency and we showed that the AC<br>loss in the wine is the key to that<br>success and we did it with IP that's<br>here so is it the solution to highspeed<br>rail we think so and<br>actually I think Jeffy Todd is going to<br>say a few bits about it alongside myself<br>so I promise not to bore you with just<br>my voice the Robinson Research Institute<br>has formed a multi-party Chinese<br>collaboration revolutionizing high-speed<br>train travel across Asia and Europe so<br>the core of our work has been in<br>applying superc conductivity to build<br>machines that are more efficient about a<br>third of the size and about a third of<br>the mass we've secured a very large<br>contract it's worth three other<br>companies in China and this is about<br>enabling trains to go faster and they<br>want to go across Asia at<br>450k our technology enables that the<br>Chinese government has a strategic<br>project to connect China with other<br>countries and the rail is a key part of<br>that strategy they very much see us as<br>being a supplier into their chain and<br>being Incorporated in they want to<br>accelerate their manufacturing the<br>natural way we work in New Zealand which<br>is alongside those companies for that<br>Innovation is very much what they want<br>to do that's when you know this is<br>really no longer just a transaction it's<br>a partnership beyond the core traction<br>Transformers project for China there are<br>opportunities to leverage the technology<br>globally basically this whole<br>relationship is growing so Victoria will<br>end up having a strategic relationship<br>with them that is teaching it research<br>and its commercialization that is the<br>best thing that you can possibly imagine<br>we're excited by actually seeing it<br>being used and being used widely the<br>opportunity is there with China they<br>just want to bring the best expertise<br>together to deliver the outcomes they<br>have real challenges that they need to<br>solve ideal Partnerships for us well I<br>think we're just at the beginning of an<br>exciting<br>Journey as part of that that's driven<br>joint PhD arrangements with China we<br>have a close relationship with some of<br>that joint PhD supervision and Joint PhD<br>students who join us here in New<br>Zealand but it's about solving<br>application specific problems how do you<br>overcome the real problem not just the<br>problem in the<br>lab and we showed that you can bring the<br>New Zealand supply chain into cutand<br>markets but are we ready for the next<br>big<br>problems some of the people in this room<br>know exactly about our electricity<br>system we're blessed by our resources<br>and our renewable<br>Supply we have truly<br>sustainable and renewable electricity<br>Supply in this<br>country but transport is our Dirty<br>Little Secret in that it is a massive<br>drain on our economy the import of oil<br>and what we burn and emit into the into<br>the<br>air our transport routes long and<br>skinny and often the only Rapid Transit<br>option available to us without massive<br>infrastructure investment is<br>Aviation<br>internationally it's coming under closer<br>scrutiny a flag carrier also wants to<br>decarbonize what they're<br>doing but we need to do it in a way that<br>is sustainable without crippling our<br>high value exports<br>and the technology that you could use<br>for Aviation can be applied on other<br>heavy<br>transport so electric heavy transport<br>could make an enormous impact on our<br>emissions so how do we solve that with a<br>lot of<br>help so it's not just the staff I I<br>particularly chose here<br>students working on this problem I will<br>highlight jerson Gonzalez who's joined<br>us for optical fiber sensing in<br>cryogenic environments he joined us to<br>study a PhD with<br>me hugely<br>successful we're looking at Tony and Gus<br>Gus did his PhD looking at AC loss and<br>stacks of superconductor Tony is Imaging<br>the supercurrent in a power supply that<br>fits in the palm of your hand that FS<br>thousands of ouns<br>you am mean AC loss towards the<br>Transformers and being able to model it<br>again Kent<br>Hamilton really exceptional the way that<br>Kent has developed very proud of the way<br>he's developed from being starting with<br>me as just a graduate through now as a<br>really high class independent<br>researcher just like all of the others<br>and Muhammad Muhammad joined me to solve<br>the problems around how do we reduce<br>friction at the bearings in these<br>machines so we can make them efficient<br>how do we make them go really fast he<br>holds the record now so he's had he's<br>had the machines running in our lab at<br>18,000 and he's under pressure at the<br>moment cuz I want 200,000<br>RPM and we think we can do<br>it so actually I have a little video<br>that is amusing at least to my wife<br>because uh the ministry made this video<br>about the aviation and uh because of my<br>subtitled here today at the Robinson<br>Research Institute part of the faculty<br>of engineering at Victoria University of<br>Wellington this lab is where all of the<br>real science and engineering work<br>associated with the super conducting<br>machines happens here we're carrying out<br>work to develop the world's fastest<br>super conting electric motor that's<br>going to be powering the next generation<br>of electric aircraft to carry passengers<br>on domestic travel domestic aircraft<br>currently are one of the worst polluters<br>into the environment they emit their<br>their their emissions right at the worst<br>point in the atmosphere and and it's<br>been recognized by the Paris Accord and<br>we've got to reduce the emissions from<br>aircraft by<br>30% um by 2030 part of that means we<br>have to go to Turbo electric aircraft<br>but in order to do turbo electric<br>aircraft require superconductive Motors<br>this is part of an international effort<br>at solving the challenges around<br>delivering those high-speed Motors we<br>follow a strategy to developing systems<br>that can be manufactured in New Zealand<br>from this type of Technology MB have<br>been funding um projects and some of the<br>Genesis of this work came out of smart<br>ideas and that's all come together at<br>the much higher level now towards the<br>application where we're integrating in<br>with the world experts and the world<br>leading companies to deliver uh world's<br>fastest<br>machine so what<br>now I can show you where the generator<br>for a hybrid system<br>is but actually we've taken it bigger<br>we've taken the Robinson principle and<br>we've applied it to a much wider degree<br>across the whole<br>country and we did that through a<br>technology platform program with the<br>ministry and this is integrating in for<br>the electri electrifying large scale<br>transport can we accelerate the<br>development of<br>small light high power propulsion<br>systems for Aviation and for land<br>transport look at the whole of system<br>nobody who wants to make something work<br>will just look at a motor they look at<br>the cooling system they look at the way<br>you integrate it how do you have the<br>drivetrain how do you have the power<br>feed to it so we needed to cover those<br>areas<br>off where are the people going to come<br>from Key part of our strategic agreement<br>with Air New Zealand is around how do we<br>plan how are we going to service what<br>what are we going to do so we need a<br>whole new range of Technology<br>practitioners not just undergraduates<br>not just postgraduates we actually need<br>practitioners what are the tech primary<br>technology gaps what system design<br>tradeoffs any engineer worth his salt or<br>her soul looks at a system and says it's<br>never going to be perfect but what do I<br>outcome so we used the principles that<br>again thank you<br>best we train the Next<br>Generation and we use the application to<br>drive the<br>R&amp;D and we have an impressive set of<br>Partners we have Air New Zealand we have<br>Airbus we have pratton Whitney<br>Callahan Innovation around some of this<br>very specific cry colder<br>technology we've using the cryogenic<br>system technology out of<br>aut we're using ARA and manaal because<br>we actually are driving a whole new<br>level four program that is actually<br>doing those uh that training of the<br>practitioners that Air New Zealand want<br>to roll out with their staff<br>we're working with University of<br>Cambridge we now work with multiple<br>teams we're working with the gallium<br>nitride research team we're working with<br>the applied super conductivity team<br>we're working with the electronic<br>devices team we're across three teams<br>wanting to work on this with us Kyoto<br>University university of Canterbury par<br>Electronics with University of ockland<br>we have the best team in the country<br>around the par electronics and they're<br>now upskilled in doing called cryogenic<br>par electronics that make the aircraft<br>happen and we're driving that in a way<br>that is opening the full system<br>opportunities and then with Cas in<br>career one of the best experts on<br>cryogenic system design in the coolers<br>is working with us very closely so it's<br>a strong team and we got a lot of people<br>coming through there are people in this<br>room who I'm I'm going to look up and<br>embarrass you Sophie<br>who have worked on things that are not<br>just superc conducting Sophie is an<br>electronic sorry is a computer systems<br>computer scientist n<br>ECS she came in and has helped<br>us do the modeling and the systems<br>around the whole electric drivetrain<br>cryogenic hydrogen battery hybrid and<br>the models are being rolled out across<br>the world through a platform that's open<br>source that all of the developers are<br>using for an aero visualization<br>monitoring Sophie of course is very<br>embarrassed I'm pointing you out because<br>uh you're still an undergraduate and<br>you're with me again this<br>summer but it's not just that that's<br>everybody in this room<br>matured we had a number of ex ex<br>computer system people stand up Bradley<br>say hello<br>who who who joined us from from ECS he<br>did enn as the course um and he joined<br>us to do his study as Masters I've never<br>had a masters who didn't get a<br>distinction and he didn't let me<br>down research Masters Bradley of course<br>worked with us he interned he worked<br>with us as an RA for a while after as<br>well but he's flown off he's part of a<br>growing Empire that's coming out of the<br>monster that's been created by one of my<br>EXP PhD students but that's a great<br>monster to have it's creating a drive<br>and a pull on those<br>students so what have they've been<br>working<br>on how about the generator highp<br>speeded it's a simple<br>architecture most of it was manufactured<br>in New Zealand unfortunately I had to<br>get my let's wire windings for the STA<br>wound in the USA and I say that because<br>because I really did want to do it here<br>and I think the next one we will be able<br>to do<br>here it's groundbreaking and that it's<br>one of the fastest machines that<br>generates power on a superc conducting<br>machine we did we developed it as a<br>platform to demonstrate a high<br>technology Readiness level it's critical<br>if I want you to be flying on an<br>aircraft notes I said I want you to be<br>flying on aircraft with one of my Motors<br>on then actually we need to ra raise the<br>TRL so we we used elements that already<br>high<br>TRL we simplified you're looking at the<br>windings after they came back from<br>everon Tesla on the STA here you're<br>looking at the rotor made in lower Hut<br>Precision balanced like a megawatt<br>racing car engine can be<br>balanced it uses a demonstrate it<br>becomes a demonstrator platform for<br>coils made by a HTS 110 integrating our<br>fiber optic sensing onto<br>those demonstrating the flux pumps how<br>do you produce 1,000 amps something in<br>your hand and so we can test and<br>speed but the other thing we've done is<br>we've kept<br>IP for Aviation some of the key IP is in<br>the flux pumps<br>it enables you to reduce the cooling<br>system mass by 90% if you want to see<br>how much of an effect that is I gave you<br>the example earlier of the high-speed<br>rail and the<br>Transformer half of the mass on a conven<br>on on that High-Speed Rail Transformer<br>on a conventional Transformer is cooling<br>system to be able to handle the losses<br>through that<br>system it's the same story when you<br>consider other Technologies like this<br>this this technology allows us to drop<br>the cryogenic load and in an aircraft<br>mass is critically<br>important mass of the Cryer coer the<br>mass of the current sources mass of the<br>fuel so this is how you achieve what<br>everybody wants to do so even with the<br>global effort that's happening around<br>superconducting machines being<br>required for the large scale Aviation<br>they all want to access the New Zealand<br>IP and want to work with us on that and<br>that brings our supply chain into those<br>systems so what is the aviation solution<br>so this is what Grant lumon is pulling<br>his hair out over at the moment just<br>looking around I Sor he's up<br>there and he's pulling his hair out<br>because we're finalizing the design for<br>the build of this machine we're working<br>with Partners internationally and we've<br>brought a whole syst system and it's<br>gone through a number of iterations<br>already but we're integrating the<br>cooling system it has additive<br>manufacturing that enables us to drop<br>Mass out of the cooling system it has<br>the cry corer integrated in and we're<br>using<br>multifunctionality to deliver the whole<br>system<br>objective so it doesn't just stop with<br>the<br>mechanics lightweight par<br>Electronics we finding things out on the<br>Behavior now that are enabling us to<br>make very efficient very small power<br>converters and that's possible by again<br>work with the best that team that we're<br>working with on those power transfer are<br>some of the best in the world we're<br>upskilling them in the cryogenics<br>they're upskilling Us in how we solve<br>this problem it's a win-win for the<br>whole<br>country and we're producing the industry<br>next okay so we have a vision that<br>vision isn't just Aviation it isn't just<br>Motors we're making a difference in<br>sustainable<br>Aviation but the challenges we're<br>solving enable heavy<br>transport the knowledge the technology<br>and IP is being used to leverage and<br>bootstrap other<br>applications it's great when I have<br>staff and students saying that they're<br>going to leave because they're setting<br>something up and they're going to take<br>some of some of your stuff with<br>them a cryogenic optical sensing is at<br>the heart of Fusion Energy in<br>Commonwealth Fusion systems in the<br>USA it's the critical failure protection<br>in what they're doing for the world for<br>the step reactor for the step Fusion for<br>clean sustainable energy and it's the<br>heart of their protection we're building<br>a superconducting flux pump James rice<br>is one of the PhD students who's<br>actually flying out to Oxford to Cullum<br>to the jet laboratory as part of the<br>magnet team um in just two weeks time<br>and he's looking at a 50,000 amp Supply<br>that supplies the toac field coils from<br>something that<br>rack so there is more I could say but<br>I'm not going to but there's commercial<br>opportunities that are happening here in<br>New<br>Zealand they're already being leveraged<br>growing we have exciting<br>technology partners and a nent New<br>Zealand industry that could enable a low<br>carbon future not just for us but for<br>the rest of the world there is a high<br>value science and engineering<br>opportunity that we are bringing the<br>Next Generation into I get excited when<br>they get excited that they see that they<br>can do mechatronics they can do that<br>engineering they can actually make a<br>difference to the carbon future for<br>themselves those opportunities are<br>growing our alumni are already creating<br>new Industries in sustainable energy<br>generation here in New Zealand<br>they're bringing new<br>challenges and they would grow in this<br>high value market for domestic<br>exploitation and I think it's cool<br>they're absorbing our postgraduates into<br>industry so where does that put the<br>Institute that puts the Institute with a<br>huge reach internationally I realize I<br>haven't updated some of the newer um<br>partners that we have on here but<br>we're active over the whole world and<br>is but I'm grateful to the staff at<br>students at pyo Robinson in particular<br>Prof Bob Buckley and all of these young<br>people I didn't have all of the staff or<br>some of the junior staff these are some<br>of the people who come through as<br>students through me have interacted with<br>me you'll see your names up there<br>I'm working on there may be a few that<br>are<br>missing because when I counted them up I<br>realized there was more than<br>60 but that's the story and they're the<br>people who are going to drive this<br>forward and actually make a name and n<br>stand for this<br>University so with<br>T<br>TOA before I go to my sheet I have to<br>say I think we agree that that was a<br>super<br>presentation by a super<br>professor and a super<br>story about super<br>students super<br>graduates and uh super entrepreneurs<br>super scientists super<br>Engineers working for a super Institute<br>with a super<br>leadership helping us to be a super<br>University in a super country so well<br>you it's not all about superc<br>conductivity this is one of those<br>lectures that I understood most of it<br>and I'm just I feel comfortable and my<br>name is asan MP I'm the pro Vice<br>Chancellor for the faculties of science<br>health engineering architecture and<br>design Innovation and I also look after<br>our fantastic three research<br>institutes uh Robinson Research<br>Institute fery research institutes and<br>Antarctic research in center and it's my<br>great pleasure to give the vot of thanks<br>to Professor Rod B Co for tonight's<br>lecture and from here onwards I'm not<br>going to call you Professor R bcck I'm<br>going to call call you rot is that the<br>right uh pyo or Robinson Research<br>Institute are World leading pioneers of<br>high temperature super<br>conductivity uh tonight Rod provided a<br>glimpse into how this multidisciplinary<br>team have been<br>engineering the science of super<br>conductivity into application from<br>generators to power Transformers to high<br>field magnets to trains to<br>transportation systems and<br>Beyond as a long serving member and the<br>deputy director uh Rod is at the<br>Forefront of this Innovation a key<br>player in Robinson's journey to making<br>the impossible<br>possible in this lecture he highlighted<br>the key priorities which have<br>contributed to his team's success in<br>solving complex scientific and<br>engineering<br>problems including partnership<br>developing emerging talent and removing<br>technical Road<br>Blocks we are all too aware of the<br>importance of this work at the time of<br>climate<br>crisis where reducing energy waste and<br>carbon emissions is of critical<br>importance I have to mention that our<br>University is committed to<br>sustainability and soon hopefully our<br>academic will be able to travel on<br>electric<br>electrically driven airplanes and so we<br>get rid of our carbon Footprints once<br>and for<br>all so this also helps us to reduce<br>energy waste and and carbon emissions in<br>all the other things that we do cars and<br>Transport some of Rod's notable projects<br>include the development of the<br>manufacturing and qualification of Robel<br>cables for GCS<br>the design and build of a one megga volt<br>amp superconducting power transformer<br>development of the HDs dyn for machines<br>and the NZ MB program developing<br>aircraft HDs electric propulsion<br>technology but his contributions extend<br>beyond his Cutting Edge research on his<br>teaching and supervision of a large<br>number of<br>postgraduate research students some of<br>whom are now our staff<br>and participating speaking and<br>contributing to Major International<br>conferences and leading international<br>partnership<br>initiatives Rod has demonstrated that it<br>is it it truly takes a village to<br>achieve the impossible tonight he spoke<br>about uh Professor Bob Buckley's<br>tenacity drive and focus for Mission<br>oriented or Mission Le<br>research it's very obvious<br>that all those are shared qualities by<br>Rod and what we are incredibly<br>privileged to have him in our University<br>and our team and our division someone at<br>the frontier of research that will be<br>lifechanging and sustaining for all of<br>us in the years to come Rod is not only<br>an expression of what we are good<br>at he's also a great example of what we<br>are good for and also with a clear<br>direction of what we should be good for<br>in future years Rod it's my pleasure<br>it's my honor to be your colleague and<br>to congratulate you on a fantastic in<br>augural professorial lecture and with<br>this I would like to invite everyone<br>here to join us uh outside room for some<br>refreshments but before going there I<br>would like to join me again to thank rod</p></main><footer
