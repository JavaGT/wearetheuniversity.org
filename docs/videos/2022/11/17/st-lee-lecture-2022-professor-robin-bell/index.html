studies<br>my name is<br>chancellor for the faculties of science<br>health engineering architecture and<br>design innovation<br>and it's my pleasure to be your host<br>Tonight<br>I would like to extend a particularly<br>warm welcome to Professor Robin Bell<br>and Carl her husband<br>just had a conversation with Robin and<br>going off the notes at the moment I<br>think I'm going to get in trouble later<br>I've just had the conversation and I was<br>given a challenge of to guess how Robin<br>and her husband got here<br>and I I couldn't guess I think uh I just<br>Sail on ships and I never thought that<br>Robin and husband got here on a boat<br>all the way crossing the Pacific Ocean<br>I mean seagull Engineers really don't<br>like to go through Pacific Ocean because<br>any danger you get at the middle of that<br>is going to be very difficult to get<br>help and I really admire your courage to<br>to to get on your boat Sailing Boat with<br>just a very little engine to to get all<br>the way to to New Zealand well done and<br>it's amazing<br>and I'm sure it was very environmentally<br>friendly as well and they said yours<br>your carbon footprint was almost zero<br>well done<br>um<br>Professor Bell is here tonight because<br>of the generosity of the Lee foundation<br>on behalf of Dr Lee song t for whom this<br>annual lecture is named<br>I would like to acknowledge the passing<br>of Dr Lee in July this year<br>and note that tonight's lecture is a<br>tribute to his<br>extraordinary record of philanthropy and<br>support of education and learning which<br>expand several decades<br>uh the university is grateful for the<br>continued support of the Lee foundation<br>in their efforts to Foster excellence in<br>Education and Research<br>we are privileged to be one of the<br>universities bestowed with Dr Lee's<br>generosity<br>and honored to be included alongside<br>prestigious universities like Oxford<br>Cambridge and Harvard which have all<br>been benefited from the foundation<br>support with building libraries<br>offering fellowships and hosting annual<br>lectures<br>events such as this lecture contribute<br>to the world leading scholarship<br>undertaken by the universities Antarctic<br>Research Center<br>in their goal to better understand<br>Antarctic processes and their influence<br>on the global climate system<br>our University's involvement in<br>Antarctic research goes back over 60<br>years<br>the Antarctic Research Center was<br>formally established in 1972<br>and our university has this year<br>celebrated 50 years of providing a<br>platform<br>for our scientists to lead the way in<br>developing drilling systems to extract<br>geological samples and better<br>investigate<br>ancient climate changes on the Antarctic<br>continent<br>the center also offers teaching and<br>government advisory services with<br>several staff involved in prominent<br>International efforts<br>such as intergovernmental panel on<br>climate change<br>more recently by working closely with<br>our partners<br>such as gns and Neva or crown research<br>institutes the center has become a<br>global leader in the computational<br>modeling of glaciers and ice sheets in<br>response to climate change<br>it has grown to be recognized as a world<br>leader in Antarctic science and a key<br>player in major research operations<br>attracting significant government<br>investment and interest<br>the Antarctic research centers will<br>contribute significantly to our<br>University's effort to enhance<br>resilience and sustainability maintain<br>research Partnerships with local and<br>Global organizations and contribute to<br>the resolution of some of the most<br>pressing challenges facing<br>our Earth<br>the annual SC lecture is an important<br>event in the center's calendar<br>it provides a valuable opportunity to<br>hear from an internationally renowned<br>guest speaker and to celebrate the<br>successful research and collaboration<br>programs being undertaken by our<br>scientists<br>our speaker tonight Professor Bell<br>specializes in geophysics particularly<br>in relation to ice sheets<br>with her research focusing on<br>understanding how they work and will<br>change in the future<br>Professor Bell directs research programs<br>in both Antarctica and Greenland<br>and has developed technology to gain new<br>insights into our changing planet<br>her research has led to a number of<br>important scientific discoveries<br>including the detection of volcanoes<br>beneath the West Antarctic Ice<br>and several large lakes sealed deep<br>beneath the eyes<br>in fact in fact her work has been so<br>impactful that she has an Antarctic<br>Mountain named after her<br>so this is the time all of you get more<br>jealous<br>during her career Professor Bell has<br>contributed to over 100 peer-reviewed<br>Publications as well as a U.S Senate<br>testimonies National Academy reports and<br>popular media Publications<br>she has held several high-profile<br>leadership positions in polar science<br>such as a fellow of the American<br>geophysical Union<br>of which he was President between 2019<br>and 2020.<br>Professor Bell is currently a research<br>professor<br>andalemond Doherty Earth Observatory at<br>Columbia University<br>so without further Ado please join me in<br>welcoming Professor Robin Bell to the<br>podium<br>thank you very much Dean uh<br>Tina Koto Tina Koto<br>call Robin Bell Nago<br>call Adirondacks<br>te Munga KO Hudson te AWA<br>Maple Rose<br>day<br>Waka<br>thank you very much for having me I'm<br>very honored my name is Robin Bell<br>the Adirondacks where we went during the<br>pandemic and where my family celebrates<br>things large and small<br>is my mountain<br>the Hudson River where we sailed out of<br>to come here is my River<br>it's a river where I've seen tremendous<br>change when Carl and I first went down<br>the river when we were just out of<br>college in a small wooden boat without<br>an engine even worse<br>we had to row<br>the river was very dirty<br>and one couldn't imagine wanting to<br>touch it<br>the river now is clean enough that our<br>children swam in it when they grow up<br>and it's a river that gives me hope as<br>we look at our planet today<br>uh Columbia University has been my home<br>for decades I've been very honored to be<br>work at Lamont Doherty and the maple<br>Rose is the name of our boat<br>which we got here so thank you very much<br>I'm very honored to be here today<br>uh<br>but I'm really simply the Storyteller<br>science is<br>a total team sport it's a total we are<br>working together to build this body of<br>knowledge to push it to find out where<br>we disagree where the bumps are where<br>things aren't quite right<br>and it takes many people it takes Pilots<br>it takes people who do Logistics that<br>people makes takes engineers and<br>scientists and so I am really just here<br>today as the spokesperson for all these<br>people who have helped me over the years<br>and helped basically us us as a species<br>because we are in a unique position as a<br>species that we can see how our planet<br>works and even more importantly actually<br>understand how our planet is changing<br>and what we spend a lot of this<br>afternoon discussing can we make robust<br>models to predict the future of our<br>planet so it really is I am just the<br>Storyteller of Antarctic Ice today and I<br>hope by the time we're done you will<br>have some of my wonderment about how old<br>it is<br>how beautiful it is and understand why<br>it is unforgiving too<br>so that's the journey I hope we're going<br>to take today<br>um<br>when you think of Antarctica you know<br>depends on where you're from what you<br>think about you might think of a map<br>like this it's kind of like an<br>elephant's head Maybe<br>or maybe you think of<br>something like penguins running all over<br>the place beautiful penguins jumping in<br>but everybody has a different picture of<br>Antarctica but when I close my eyes<br>and think of Antarctica<br>this is what I see this is a picture<br>from the top of the ice sheet very close<br>to domay I think of this landscape<br>it's kind of like being in the ocean in<br>that the Horizon is tremendous you just<br>maybe the desert's the same way where<br>the sky goes on forever<br>but here<br>the sky is an intense blue it's blue<br>because the atmosphere is so thin<br>there's actually less clouds there's<br>less moisture so the sky is this intense<br>blue and then when you lie down on the<br>ice sheet and close your eyes<br>all you can hear<br>is<br>the tinkle of the of the snow crystals<br>bouncing across the snow surface<br>Antarctica is a very special place and<br>my job has been to see if I can look<br>through that ice right here the ice is<br>between three and four kilometers and I<br>can't hear much putting my ear down<br>except for those crystals bouncing<br>across the surface so I hope that you<br>know you'll both walk away with the<br>sense of wonder and Beauty but also<br>of the mysterious things beneath the ice<br>sheet<br>um<br>there are two ice sheets it turns out in<br>Antarctica we kind of think of it as one<br>big lump of ice<br>but in fact there are two it's<br>controlled by the geology and very<br>cleverly there's East which is what we<br>if we went straight I'm a little turned<br>around we went straight South from here<br>we would hit East Antarctica<br>it's a big piece event of ice and we'll<br>come back and by the time you walk away<br>you'll understand it it's the old<br>piece of ice it's thick it's old it's<br>sitting up high and then the one that<br>you might have heard people worry about<br>a little bit more is called West<br>Antarctica it's cleverly in the Western<br>Hemisphere mostly that's where it gets<br>its clever name and it's um<br>younger<br>it's more sensitive to climate change<br>and it's a little bit more dynamic as<br>we'll see so that's sort of your<br>introduction to we're going to come back<br>to this a couple times to the two parts<br>of Antarctica and the two ice sheets<br>that it holds<br>but I thought we'd just start with how<br>old is Antarctica and when did it get<br>covered in ice first let's just look at<br>those little bouncing balls at the top<br>and if you start on the<br>side closest to me so on your left side<br>if you're good at left and right<br>um You can see what Antarctica looked<br>like you know 45 million years ago which<br>is geologists not really that long ago<br>you can see<br>there was no ice in Antarctica<br>it was a<br>exposed there might have been some ice<br>in the mountains the interesting thing<br>was CO2 in the world was higher and<br>temperature was higher<br>unglaciated Antarctica which had you<br>know<br>trees that might not have been that<br>different than some of the trees here in<br>New Zealand you might have recognized it<br>if you were time traveled back<br>and then if we travel through time<br>going away from me towards the other<br>side of the room you can see that over<br>time CO2 starts to drop and Global<br>temperature that's the bottom plot you<br>can see global temperature rolls off the<br>world was much warmer it was on when it<br>was when Antarctica had no ice it was on<br>the average of 25 degrees C it was a<br>normal temperature and as the<br>temperature of the planet got colder and<br>colder<br>it eventually hit a moment about well<br>yeah around 34 million years ago where<br>Antarctica became glaciated East<br>Antarctica became glaciated first<br>because as we'll see it sits up higher<br>it's easiest to grow glaciers on a uh on<br>high mountains<br>and then the world got colder and<br>eventually it's really hard to grow an<br>ice sheet in West Antarctica because as<br>we'll see it's a shallow ocean<br>and it's really hard to cover a shallow<br>ocean in<br>um ice but you can see eventually in<br>that middle ball eventually<br>um over on the left you'll see that West<br>Antarctica got covered and then in the<br>last<br>period of the planet we had this<br>oscillation between when the ice sheets<br>and that's the top you can see the top<br>right is a sort of a basketball picture<br>of what it looked like when the ice<br>sheet shrunk you know during a sheet<br>collapse and then you on the bottom one<br>you see what it looked like probably<br>during the last glacial maximum about 25<br>000 years ago and what was straw and how<br>do we know that we know that from the<br>climate records in the<br>sediments in the ice cores and that<br>bottom condition where you see<br>Antarctica looks much whiter that's when<br>North America also was covered with ice<br>when<br>New York City was covered with ice and<br>essentially the the bridge if you've<br>ever seen the start of the New York City<br>marathon is across a bridge called The<br>verrazaro Narrows that in essence Matt<br>Marks the southern extent of the Lauren<br>tidai Sheen that actually Bridge goes<br>across the terminal Moraine of a<br>laurentite ice sheet so if you think of<br>how far south did the ishigo think of<br>the start of the New York Marathon in<br>North America so there was a lot more<br>ice<br>and it's come and gone but there's about<br>a hundred thousand year cycle so we're<br>in currently in between those two<br>obviously between the glacial maximum<br>and the rain eye Sheet collapse<br>and just as an aside when I started<br>graduate school there was still a<br>discussion was were we about to go into<br>another Ice Age that was the<br>conversation in the Halls from a number<br>of very prominent<br>scientists who now and then I remember<br>as a graduate student hearing the<br>conversation shift to no the climate is<br>warming and that's the consensus that's<br>certainly built over time<br>so what does Antarctica look like<br>these are some of my favorite pictures<br>the one on the left is sort of shows you<br>how the ice sheet flows in the middle<br>it's pretty stable it moves you know<br>maybe across the the podium in a year<br>really slow but on the edges you can see<br>little hints of rivers those rivers are<br>going kilometers a year those are the<br>engines in Antarctica that pull the ice<br>from the interior and deposit in the<br>ocean those are the mechanisms that in<br>the future will move ice into the global<br>oceans and cause sea level but what does<br>it look like underneath I've kind of<br>been alluding to<br>um the two ice sheets being very<br>different and so on the right you can<br>see what the topography looks like<br>underneath the ice sheet anywhere that's<br>blue is below sea level<br>and anywhere that's green or brown is<br>above sea level so you can see how<br>different the two halves of Antarctica<br>are that one is really a shallow Sea and<br>the other<br>is<br>a continental Plateau something like say<br>Africa or Australia or maybe even India<br>given that geologically that's where<br>it's uh<br>siblings are shall we say that's when<br>what sat next to Antarctica before<br>gondwana broke up<br>so what let's step through and look<br>so this is if we look at those cross<br>sections if you'd like to look at Cross<br>sections I did<br>um<br>the top one is across East Antarctica<br>and what you can see is that East<br>Antarctica is pretty much above sea<br>level<br>there's a lot underneath and we'll take<br>a we'll take a tour of East Antarctica<br>and then you can see West Antarctica is<br>mostly below sea level that<br>um the ocean is on the right and it very<br>clear that<br>um<br>as I'd like to say West Antarctica has<br>her toes in the water and that<br>connection to the ocean means that in<br>the future not only as the climate warms<br>it is that the ocean being able to reach<br>the base of the ice sheet which makes<br>the ice sheet inherently unstable and<br>you know and we will warm both the<br>atmosphere and the ocean but the that<br>ability of the ocean to sneak in and<br>reach the ice sheet where it's under<br>water already is inherently an in stable<br>position<br>so let's take a tour through<br>um how we how we built those cross<br>sections so over time<br>we've developed a<br>couple of different techniques to<br>measure how thick the ice is<br>in the 1950s during the international<br>geophysical year dynamite and explosives<br>were the preferred way of measuring plus<br>gravity my favorite potential field were<br>the way to measure ice thickness you can<br>see on the left you can see a tractor<br>vehicle kind of like the one Hillary<br>drove across Antarctica<br>but you can also see this giant Fountain<br>of uh snow that's not a volcano that's<br>actually a explosion it means actually<br>they didn't put it down deep enough<br>because you'd hope the energy went into<br>the ice instead of the air but it's a<br>dramatic picture and gets you to<br>understand that this is how you were we<br>originally measured the ice thickness<br>over time we figured out that we could<br>do it with radar<br>that that was less energy intense and<br>that we could do it first by dragging a<br>radar in a little<br>um<br>wooden Hut on skis behind a tractor and<br>then eventually putting it on airplanes<br>and that meant that you could look at a<br>much bigger region of Antarctica and it<br>was the same idea on the right you can<br>see a ping going out from the airplane<br>through the ice sheet and bouncing back<br>it's you know just the same as figuring<br>out how far away a echo is from a snap<br>of lightning and listening to the<br>Thunder<br>and that allows you to time<br>how far away the lightning is we<br>basically measure the time to the<br>response of the radar to bounce off both<br>the surface all the layers in the ice<br>and The Rock underneath and the middle<br>is a picture of what a a modern<br>radar system and this was from a project<br>that I was part of that was joined with<br>New Zealand and the U.S where<br>um<br>it's called Rosetta and we use this<br>instrument called the ice pod where the<br>uh this instrument that the everybody's<br>lying on it snapped onto any C130 and<br>allowed you to turn any C-130 into an<br>Imaging machine and allowed us to look<br>at what the water depths and the shape<br>of the cavity are underneath the Ross<br>ice shelf<br>um so those are the ways you can either<br>use explosions or radar to get a sense<br>of what's underneath the ice sheets so<br>what does a radar image looks like<br>um I love radar if I'd remembered I<br>would have brought my radar address I<br>actually have an image of<br>I've made a dress that has radar on it<br>just because what a beautiful way to<br>look at our planet but not having that<br>I'm going to have to show you it on the<br>screen and these are the layers each one<br>of these is an isochron or on basically<br>a year in time it means some some point<br>in time where the electrical<br>conductivity of the ice change could be<br>a volcanic eruption could be a something<br>that may the conductivity of the ice<br>change and so energy bounced off of that<br>so that's what those layers are on the<br>bottom this zigzag that's actually<br>mountains underneath the ice sheet and<br>then in this Valley<br>the very bright reflector is energy<br>coming off of water water is a much<br>better reflector than Rock so you get a<br>stronger reflection back whenever you<br>fly over<br>water with enough with a radar system so<br>this is what it looks like this is a an<br>example of a what the equipment we use<br>in the interior a twin otter with uh<br>radar systems and then because<br>it's such an honor to be in Antarctica<br>and you want to basically make sure you<br>look at everything at once we also put a<br>laser system to Max GI surface a gravity<br>meter to measure the<br>the basically the iron contact or the<br>geology of the topography underneath and<br>a gravity meter to get a sense of what<br>the density of the rocks are so doing<br>everything we can when we're there<br>so this is again going back to East<br>Antarctica we're going to take a quick<br>tour of both Lake vostok here and the<br>gimbert's of mountains what you can see<br>is this is the ice sheet over the top<br>where you go from the white to the light<br>blue and the Dome is the very top of the<br>ice sheet domain currently the Chinese<br>have a have a base here Dom Fuji is<br>where there's an ice core that the<br>Japanese lead drilling don't see is<br>where the European Consortium drill the<br>ice core and vostok is where there's a<br>during the international geophysical<br>year the Russians<br>opened a base there because at that<br>point it was close to the magnetic South<br>Pole and there's also an ice core there<br>but let's look at what it looks like so<br>if we look at a radar image we can see<br>that the ice over Lake Foster through a<br>core we know that the ice at the bottom<br>is about 420 000 years old so just you<br>know put that in perspective<br>um humans you know Homo sapiens evolved<br>about 300 000 years ago so this ice is<br>pretty much older than human Homo<br>sapiens and this really isn't even the<br>oldest ice in West Antarctica in East<br>Antarctica it just was the first very<br>very deep ice core<br>um<br>one of the wonderful surprises<br>of Lake Foss of the vostok ice core was<br>when they got to the bottom and they<br>found that they lost the climate record<br>and the suddenly there wasn't the<br>regular<br>um<br>ability to look at what how the Isotopes<br>were changing the crystal sizes changed<br>and the electrical conductivity of the<br>and about the same time we got the first<br>image of the ice surface so on the right<br>hand side you can see this is<br>a was on the cover of nature because it<br>was so groundbreaking then it was the<br>first time we were able to look at the<br>ice surface and you can see you know a<br>domes right you can see the divides just<br>like if you were to go hiking and you<br>know you get to the top of a ridge you<br>can go down the other side so this was<br>we saw before Dome Fuji this is where<br>vostok is Dome Concordia<br>so when this came out this is a<br>wonderful example of European of<br>international collaboration what became<br>very clear was there was this incredibly<br>flat spot<br>in the middle of the ice sheet so yeah<br>there's it kind of looks like a lima<br>bean to me how big is it if one end of<br>it was here the other end would be at<br>Christchurch<br>so it's a pretty big piece of<br>flat<br>ice<br>so<br>the European scientists who saw this<br>contacted the scientist who as a young<br>student had done the seismic work during<br>the international geophysical year<br>he was a very prominent Russian<br>scientist but<br>was a little bit too Anglo<br>uh and he had misinterpreted his it<br>turns out he had shot off seismics and<br>he had concluded there was mud<br>underneath the station<br>uh he was his parents had spent a lot of<br>time in Cambridge and that meant that he<br>got<br>um exiled as a young scientist Kamchatka<br>um he left his records in the garden<br>shed in Moscow<br>many decades pass this image came out he<br>had returned to Moscow and these uh<br>European scientists called up and said<br>do you have that data<br>and he goes ah let me go check well the<br>garden shed had burned down but it turns<br>out that in the wreckage of where the<br>garden shedded used to be this is why<br>you should save your your data you know<br>this is a really a data archive story<br>you're you're your thesis might matter<br>someday just because you think it<br>doesn't<br>you never know<br>um so we went out to the garden shed he<br>found the records and he found that he'd<br>made a mistake in interpreting it it<br>actually wasn't mud it was actually<br>hundreds of meters of water<br>underneath that very flat spot so<br>suddenly they were able to this man<br>who'd been exiled to Kamchatka for<br>decades was able to get a publication<br>from his thesis on the cover of nature<br>demonstrating that there was a lake that<br>ex over 250 kilometers long beneath the<br>Russian station<br>um<br>just so you know you could identify a<br>lake this is what the this is what the<br>surface imagery looks like and if you've<br>ever been up on a glacier you know that<br>a glacier is rough right see how rough<br>the surface is here that's because that<br>ice is is rolling over topography it's<br>reflecting the topography underneath<br>and if you've ever been ice skating<br>you know or skiing over a lake you know<br>it's flat that ice is floating and<br>that's what you're seeing here you're<br>seeing that the surface of Lake vostok<br>is dead flat<br>that's because there's water under there<br>and then in case you think you can't<br>make discoveries at a international<br>meeting I was looking at this image<br>up on somebody's agu poster and they<br>were showing like vostok and all the<br>wonderful images and I kept on saying<br>but but aren't these Lakes over here on<br>the right if Lake fostalks a lake isn't<br>that flat area on the right a lake<br>anyway two months it was like one of<br>those wonderful moments where two months<br>later the people at the poster session I<br>had written a paper and discovering<br>these additional deep lakes and they<br>were actually the lakes that made me<br>worry less about the rush there was no<br>way the Russians weren't going to drill<br>into Lake vostok it was their Lake and<br>to me my only comfort was knowing that<br>there were these other big deep old<br>lakes that would be preserved regardless<br>of what the Russians did drilling into<br>Lake placstock so it was my comfort when<br>it became very clear that the Russians<br>were going to drill into Lake Bostock<br>regardless of what anybody else said<br>so that's the story of lake fostuck and<br>how it's both been it was the pretty<br>much the first ice core record and the<br>recent ice core records are important is<br>that they are the way we can actually<br>capture<br>old CO2 right we can't get that anyway<br>except for the bubbles in we can't get<br>it really well at a high resolution<br>anyway except out of ice course so it's<br>a beautiful record of what our<br>atmospheres used to look like back for<br>400 000 years don't see the ice goes<br>back 800 000 years and groups are<br>looking for ice that's more than a<br>million that is the goal<br>so let's take a look at this region the<br>the gemberts of mountains because I do<br>want you to walk away thinking wow the<br>ice Antarctica is a glorious place<br>um<br>it's hard to get to the central part of<br>Antarctica it's high<br>it's cold<br>it's very far from any Logistics base<br>Australian station here's a Chinese<br>station you can see the this is<br>five degrees of latitude so 500 you know<br>the this is a long way and it's a long<br>logistic exchange for anyone to work so<br>in essence nobody had really<br>systematically been back to this region<br>since the game birds of mountains were<br>discovered in 1958 they were discovered<br>when one of those traverses drove across<br>the ice sheet and as they were going<br>they they did Gravity in between the<br>explosions and they kept on seeing the<br>gravity was getting stronger and<br>stronger and every time they did the<br>explosion the ice was thinner<br>and they realized they discovered a<br>mountain range completely covered<br>underneath the ice sheet by the ice they<br>named it after again births of a famous<br>and even as a student I used to hear<br>rumors that there were outcrops that<br>there were some satellite images that<br>showed the uh<br>rocks of the gambrits of mountain but<br>nobody had been back there since 1958<br>and it really took the framing of the<br>international polar year in 2007 2008 to<br>get the it's this is why I'm such a<br>strong believer in international science<br>because when you can get multiple<br>Nations working together you can do<br>things that no single scientist no<br>single nation can do together you can do<br>things that<br>are pretty much impossible this is a<br>region where there's about a month where<br>the temperatures are above -50 which is<br>about where the seals on the aircraft<br>stop were start working reliably so they<br>have a very narrow window where you can<br>actually operate so we did manage to get<br>Seven Nations together<br>um we the Australians built the camp in<br>the north the Americans built the camp<br>in the South the Chinese delivered fuel<br>um the Americans airdrop fuel on this<br>side and then delivered fuel to the um<br>South and the British and the Americans<br>each brought up airplane<br>and so in that narrow window we were<br>able to keep the plane and they are<br>almost about 20 hours a day we would<br>land refuel pull the discs out<br>and what we went from was from this<br>fuzzy unknown<br>topography to what you see on your lower<br>right is actually the beautiful<br>dendritic pattern of the mountains in<br>Lake fall in the gamberts of mountains<br>something that people were totally<br>surprised about that that you would have<br>that kind of structure underneath the<br>ice sheet<br>as scientists we'd of course had written<br>a proposal that said we're going to look<br>at lakes and we don't actually really<br>think we were going to find Lakes it's<br>like yeah we'll say we'll find Lakes but<br>who's ever heard of finding lakes in a<br>mountain range<br>well it turns out every single time we<br>crossed one of these valleys and I'll<br>show you in a minute we saw one of these<br>bright Echoes there was water in all of<br>those valleys<br>so this is really what it ended up<br>looking like turns out that the the<br>upper layer is a is an indication of the<br>Dome of the ice sheet domain draped over<br>the gambots of mountains and in the<br>valleys are water<br>be cool<br>then we began to think about how that<br>water is flowing<br>right<br>it's not the next question where does<br>the water flow and we're so used to<br>thinking water flows downhill<br>right that's kind of<br>walk outside and look at the hill here<br>and the water will flow downhill<br>well there's an ice sheet sitting on top<br>of the many of on all of those water<br>systems<br>and the more we thought about it the<br>more we realized that a number of those<br>systems the water was being driven<br>uphill<br>that these were actually a place in the<br>world where we had backwards flowing<br>Rivers<br>I'm not fast I mean Rivers it's probably<br>an exaggeration how about a little bit<br>of water flow seeping along the bottom<br>of the ice sheet but water flow going<br>uphill nonetheless<br>we were pretty we were pretty jazzed<br>history in this survey<br>that we had so here are the mountains<br>and you can see the ice we weren't able<br>to date the ice because there's not a<br>good<br>um<br>there is not a good ice core there yet<br>but you can see there's water in the<br>valleys and there's mountains all over<br>and there's water on this side<br>but what was weird was there was a place<br>that the layering didn't seem to stay<br>flat we're roughly flat there was<br>something that looked really weird it<br>looked like that<br>now okay so this is right in the middle<br>is about 2 000 meters of ice<br>this so this thing is about half of the<br>ice sheet thickness<br>and being good skeptical scientists you<br>know here are the mountains and here's<br>one of our<br>our water bodies being good scientists<br>we were totally skeptical we thought<br>okay we have really screwed up this is<br>the biggest error in our data yet we are<br>getting side swipes you know something<br>is happening this can't be real but we<br>saw this in line after line after line<br>and when we looked at it it turns out<br>that each one of those upward flowing<br>river valleys was connected with one of<br>these bodies what we had found was not<br>only water flowing uphill<br>but when it reached the circs in The<br>Valleys where the ice got thin<br>and the gradient in the ice sheet got<br>steep that the water froze back on<br>so we are actually seeing sort of from<br>melting at one end of the valley water<br>being driven uphill and freezing back<br>onto the base of the ice sheet<br>I realized I forgot to tell you why it<br>was melting at one end the ice sheet Can<br>Only Hold so much can only support so<br>much ice before even though it's minus<br>50 at the top the geothermal flux at the<br>bottom is going to make the bring the<br>base of the ice sheet to the melting<br>temperature which is about minus two and<br>it's not it's not a pressure issue it's<br>actually the geothermal flux at the base<br>so here what we were doing was even<br>though there's melt where the ice is<br>thick when the water reached the thin<br>area the water was refreezing back on<br>so<br>the<br>East Antarctica is<br>kind of like a place you could<br>not imagine if you're just for looking<br>at the top you couldn't imagine that as<br>you sat at the end of that Runway<br>listening to the snow that underneath of<br>you were Lakes<br>mountains that hadn't been exposed for<br>30 minutes 30 no not only had no human<br>ever walked on them they hadn't been<br>exposed for 34 million years but we also<br>had rivers lakes and water running<br>uphill it was one of those and it was<br>only possible because the international<br>science Community worked together<br>I think it should just do a little bit<br>of West Antarctica because that's what's<br>in many people's mind this is mostly<br>below sea level here's sea levels here<br>in the blue on the right and you can see<br>it's<br>it's not as thick remember West East<br>Antarctica is up to four kilometers<br>thick it's about two and a half<br>kilometers in West Antarctica and<br>it is more susceptible it is the one<br>that took is younger because it took<br>longer to grow it's harder to grow an<br>ice sheet in an ocean than it is<br>um<br>on a mountain<br>and it is easier to have it collapse<br>when we look at it it's it also doesn't<br>have as much excitement it's kind of<br>you know here's the topography I mean<br>that's not anywhere near as exciting<br>it's also younger when you look at the<br>layers it's only the oldest layer you<br>see is only 68 000 years remembering we<br>were seeing ice that's 800 000 years old<br>in East Antarctica<br>uh the but it sits in a very different<br>place not only is it sitting on mud<br>below sea level it's a much more active<br>terrain it's that we discovered as the<br>dean commented we discover an active<br>volcano underneath the ice sheet here<br>and it's<br>what is an active volcano underneath an<br>ice sheet looks like it basically<br>see a round Caldera on the surface you<br>see it sagging down because of the heat<br>coming in you're actually making a hole<br>in the surface that was the indication<br>that it wasn't just a little Peak that<br>actually the ice sheet was showing us<br>there was heat coming in and being<br>melted at the bottom we didn't have as<br>good layers in our radar back then so I<br>don't have a beautiful image to show it<br>over the volcano<br>so<br>I feel like we absolutely<br>you could talk and ask me to talk about<br>almost anything and I will touch on my<br>sheet change I think people have asked<br>me to talk about sunken ships in the<br>Hudson River and I've managed to slip in<br>sea level rise into it because I I feel<br>like we should all<br>be aware of the evidence of our planet<br>changing so that we can be spokespeople<br>to our communities<br>um so remembering that West Antarctica<br>sits in a shallow ocean what are the<br>signs of change one of the first signs<br>of change we'll just look in the upper<br>left is sort of the very emblematic loss<br>of the Ice shows on the peninsula that<br>they disappeared<br>progressively South as the surface<br>temperatures warmed so that was kind of<br>the first indication that the ice sheets<br>were warming<br>and shrinking the<br>more recently we've been able to<br>demonstrate that the ice sheets are<br>speeding up<br>losing elevation and losing mass so this<br>is we're going to zoom in and look at<br>some movies of this but the ma the<br>change is really focused in this West<br>Antarctic<br>region where<br>the ice sheets are most susceptible to<br>changing ocean temperatures<br>so let's just this is one of my favorite<br>animations we're going to look at how<br>the ice sheet<br>in the 1990s was moving about two<br>kilometers a year now this is one of<br>those giant glaciers which they call<br>them glaciers or ice strings and by the<br>2000s it had sped up to four kilometers<br>a year<br>that's a doubling of moving of ice into<br>the ocean at the same time and I like to<br>think of this as<br>um you can see the elevation change and<br>we can look at this again just because I<br>think it's so much more powerful if you<br>see the evidence as opposed to me<br>telling you<br>um what where it's yellow you're seeing<br>the surface elevation over that same<br>period that the ice sheets sped up the<br>ice sheet dropped and it dropped 60<br>meters<br>um it dropped because it's being<br>stretched ice is kind of like cheese if<br>you stretch it it gets thinner so let's<br>just look at that again just because<br>it's um<br>it's worth everybody really<br>understanding that the and as a<br>scientist you know we really look for<br>those independent measurements and this<br>the<br>velocity is made by looking at<br>um in essence surface feature tracking<br>of the ice so you can see that that's<br>one measurement made with one set of<br>satellites and then the elevation change<br>is made with a separate satellite one<br>it's been done with both radar and Laser<br>from space or from aircraft but you what<br>you can see is you can see the elevation<br>dropping as the ice sheet speeds up<br>so those are two measurements<br>um very powerful third one is we can<br>measure Gravity from space and gravity<br>from space this is called the grace<br>Mission it lets you it's one where you<br>can actually see the mass loss in the<br>same place<br>um very sensitive pair of satellites<br>chasing each other in space actually<br>watching each other move up and down<br>measuring the gravity and what you can<br>see is while there's you know there's<br>some blue in the upper right that's it<br>was a very snowy set of years here and<br>there actually was mass gain in this<br>part of East Antarctica the very strong<br>clear dominant signal is the loss of<br>mass in the same place we saw the ice<br>sheet speeding up and losing elevation<br>so very clear signature that West<br>Antarctica is losing mass<br>I could show you the same things for<br>Greenland just in case anybody's<br>neighbor ever asks them the same signals<br>are there in Greenland but we're talking<br>about Antarctica today<br>so this is really you know what I<br>consider the um<br>the ice sheet is really unforgiving<br>because<br>um<br>we're starting to these are places<br>around the globe that we see<br>um<br>where human beings have put in tide<br>gauges tide gauges aren't really very<br>fancy tools they're kind of sensors that<br>measure the water going up and down and<br>up and down and up and down but they're<br>pretty cool because you can they've been<br>doing it for a long time and first look<br>at the left and just picking your part<br>of the world pretty much all the arrows<br>are going up there that means<br>all those places sea level is going up<br>right and it's going up on the order you<br>know most of them are on the order of<br>2.7 millimeters a year<br>um I like to think of the one on the<br>upper right just because you know that's<br>right near that end of the Verrazano<br>Narrows Bridge it's right there you know<br>in lower Manhattan<br>if you ever took the ferry to see<br>anything in New York Harbor it's right<br>there but it's been there<br>since the 1860s<br>and you can see it's pretty relentless<br>and<br>what is 2.7 millimeters a year mean<br>what it means is if you put your hand on<br>your leg somewhere below your knee<br>that's how much sea level has gone up<br>probably since my grandmother was born<br>right in the last 120 years<br>so we have already started to see sea<br>level going up and it's about the same<br>here in Mountain well the the Wellington<br>curve is the one below it's only been<br>there since the 1950s but it's about 2.7<br>millimeters a year pretty much the same<br>this isn't Antarctica yet this isn't<br>Greenland yet this is mostly the ocean<br>swarming<br>the input from the ice sheets yet<br>right<br>so what is that so this is really why<br>when you look at it you realize that the<br>ice sheets<br>have been there a long time that they<br>have a history of collapsing that<br>we see change now<br>we see that the oceans are warming<br>and it's really time to look forward and<br>this is one of the real challenges it's<br>what a number of us spent today arguing<br>and talking and discussing you know how<br>it is now what this is mostly looking<br>for this is a timeline that starts in<br>1950 and goes up to 2010. and the top<br>one is CO2 depending on what we as<br>humans get our act together and do<br>and the bottom one is different future<br>sea level rises you buy 2100 and you can<br>see you know the high end is about 1.7<br>meters and the low end is 40 centimeters<br>and<br>this is what we're all working to try<br>and improve because I can tell you the<br>policy makers we were talking to today<br>were saying so what are you when are you<br>going to be able to tell us exactly one<br>of those it is and<br>what we really all of us who are working<br>in this space are trying to get our<br>understanding of the processes how do<br>those ice sheets work right because if<br>we don't have the processes right<br>we aren't telling the modelers the right<br>things to do so the modelers don't come<br>out with the right answers and then we<br>also need to understand that history<br>piece we need to understand have those<br>ice sheets collapsed in the past and<br>what were the conditions was it 1.5<br>degrees above now was it two which parts<br>collapsed did the part I show you that<br>was speeding up collapse or was it the<br>part that's over near Scott base in the<br>Ross sea you know so this is really what<br>we as scientists are working on pretty<br>much in full-time motivating us but<br>we're also really struggling on how to<br>communicate with this with communities<br>whether it's my community I live on the<br>Hudson River<br>um<br>we had Hurricane Sandy or whatever it<br>was called super strong Sandy and we had<br>sea level we had water places people had<br>never imagined it would be<br>and we had more damage because of that<br>sea level rise that had happened<br>you know just just imagine if people had<br>never really gotten this around their<br>head and they woke up morning one<br>morning and there were boats up and down<br>their Main Street and that had to be<br>moved with a bulldozer that's what it<br>was you know during Hurricane Sandy so<br>some of what we're trying to work with<br>is how we communicate the change to<br>communicate how we communicate this<br>uncertainty<br>so that communities can plan<br>appropriately knowing that we're doing<br>our best to understand but we're still<br>wondering what that range is going to be<br>so<br>in conclusion I really like to leave you<br>with this sense that Antarctica is<br>ancient beautiful but unforgiving and<br>our footprints on this planet are large<br>and I think it's our responsibilities to<br>build you know a thriving actual<br>sustainable future for everybody and<br>that means that we have to figure out<br>how every one of us<br>can turn the knobs that we have every<br>one of us has different knobs every one<br>of us lives in different communities and<br>connects differently with whether it's<br>your local community or the group you<br>work with or maybe it's<br>um the people you do sports with<br>all of us have to figure out what are<br>those knobs we can turn to make it so<br>we reduce our carbon<br>we get to the place where we are not<br>going to get those high-end and that we<br>don't see these ice sheets collapse you<br>know and it's a really a moment for all<br>of us to communicate and think about<br>what we can do as<br>individuals as Citizens as or whatever<br>you do professionally whether it's<br>scientists engineer a lawyer doctor and<br>what we can do in the global sphere so<br>with that<br>um I know thank you for your attention<br>and it's been my honor to speak with you<br>today<br>thank you thank you<br>I'm Rob Mackay director of the Antarctic<br>Research Center<br>so thank you Robin that was a really<br>stimulated and engaging talk<br>particularly the journey that's what I<br>really really enjoyed about it<br>you know as earth scientists I always<br>hear this justification for us going to<br>explore an Antarctica that we know more<br>about the moon than we do about the<br>bottom of the oceans or or that I kind<br>of get a little bit irritated with that<br>because we do know a lot about our<br>planet but I think in Antarctica<br>certainly 20 years ago<br>that was a very very valid statement and<br>it's really thanks to the research<br>efforts and bringing together these huge<br>teams that you have have built from the<br>ground up this expiration that we do<br>actually start to know more about that<br>really critical part of the ice sheet<br>that governs how quickly it flows and<br>how quickly it flows into the ocean<br>and I I can speak from my experience as<br>an undergraduate student we thought of<br>Antarctica as a big frozen piece of ice<br>sitting on the bed not doing much it was<br>Greenland that we had to worry about<br>and it was the discovery of these Lakes<br>now if our stock was known for a while<br>but we really didn't know about the<br>other ones we didn't know that they were<br>connected by these rivers and to be<br>honest this week I didn't know those<br>Rivers went uphill but we do see these<br>Lakes are connected there's a<br>hydrological network that actually<br>connects these lakes and it's<br>fundamentally changed our view of how<br>Antarctica works and it's gone from the<br>static piece of ice to something that we<br>actually are worrying about and<br>potentially could be a bigger player to<br>sea level rise than Greenland so<br>really it is a journey of Discovery<br>sometimes it's those discoveries you<br>don't want to find<br>um so yeah it wasn't great news on that<br>but there is that message of Hope in<br>there we can change a behavior and<br>potentially save those ice sheets so the<br>discovery of these water Networks<br>what what Professor Bell didn't really<br>touch on her contributions to actually<br>understanding that topography being<br>fundamental actually understanding how<br>does the Bedrock under Antarctica affect<br>how those warm Waters melt the ice sheet<br>that really astute question up the top<br>there about<br>protecting that ice sheet from those<br>warm Waters the geology mapping that is<br>fundamental so yeah fantastic talk a<br>real journey but did see that message of<br>Hope and particularly walking the walk<br>and sailing that Sailing Boat you know<br>really important that actually there's a<br>message to how to how to behave<br>sustainably<br>so just on behalf of Toyota Walker and<br>and the Antarctica Research Center just<br>thank you again for your talk it was<br>fantastic</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
