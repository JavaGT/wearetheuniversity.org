new<br>professors to to show show them after<br>the university and to the city<br>show what they've achieved and to help<br>this is a really great opportunity<br>so<br>um<br>Christian is going to talk to us today<br>so he's a professor of Sociology he<br>joined the School of Social and physical<br>sciences in 2020<br>um he did his PhD in Nottingham in 2002<br>and since then he has moved around quite<br>a way around the world at various<br>different times and he's been a lead<br>acute special research he's published<br>widely in a number of areas such as<br>ethnicity and nationalism globalism<br>Urban multiculturalism memory studies<br>and central European and Austria service<br>um those are the number of books<br>um edited a number and Brilliant<br>chapters and his most recent advice<br>about game was gone right is uh<br>nationalism Revisited from those kind of<br>works so if you would like a copy of<br>that I'm sure we can arrange to put you<br>in contact with us<br>um<br>so he's going to talk this evening we'll<br>be glad to know in a very short amount<br>of time<br>um because I'll finish soon on the<br>identity from a density grammaris to the<br>airport gate politics of the language<br>so please join me in welcoming and<br>um<br>publicity that you've all shown over the<br>last 23 years now you know it's really<br>made my condition very smooth and<br>enjoyable<br>a group of extraordinary friends are<br>joining us all on live stream<br>um including some Scholars I I admire<br>more than I can really been somewhere so<br>it's great that you guys find time for<br>for this too and I do want to say a<br>couple of things about family both<br>present and and otherwise my my wife for<br>example was meant to be here today she<br>was really really looking forward to it<br>uh sadly we didn't have a death in the<br>family on some of the messages<br>all on live stream along I think with my<br>own sisters as well so I'm really glad<br>this is possible and finally my parents<br>have traveled all the way across from<br>um I'm going to keep the uh the<br>acknowledgments uh at that but there is<br>one of the person I want to mention and<br>it's with this person wants to start<br>um that's all today a lot to offer more<br>announcements but because he said a few<br>things some 15 plus years ago that<br>an extraordinary friend he was an<br>extraordinary scholar<br>um he was extraordinarily generous but<br>that's not what I mentioned his was the<br>first uh illegal I ever attended again<br>some 15 plus years ago and at the time<br>Chris was talking about what he called<br>both the limits and the challenge of<br>translation<br>with the limits of translation Chris<br>means that essentially languages are not<br>fully translatable the most language the<br>most translation you can do is to<br>approximate meaning<br>um with the challenge no sorry we're<br>going to say something else that was his<br>point and it is like a kind of<br>predictions on that it would say if<br>foreign language teaching gets cut back<br>declines so profound cultural and<br>political consequences will follow and<br>that happens as I said some 15 plus<br>years ago I think it's been proven<br>spectacularly right<br>and I'm alluding to topics I may come<br>back to you because now Chris passed<br>away<br>much too young much too tragically he<br>said something else in that inaugural<br>events he talked about the uh the<br>challenge or responsibility of the<br>translation which wasn't actually to do<br>with Language by that what he meant was<br>that all of us who get to enjoy the<br>privilege of research their<br>responsibility uh essentially want to<br>get stuck in those rapid holes that<br>research that we did for ourselves that<br>we've had a responsibility to be brought<br>back every every now and then not<br>because what happens in those rabbit<br>holes is so terribly complicated that<br>only we understand that at all but<br>simply because the solid system that is<br>research sometimes takes over so I want<br>to take Chris's sort of warning words as<br>a kind of springboard into things I'm<br>going to say today and I want to ask<br>myself from someone from living in<br>sociologist working on the topics listed<br>on this slide what does that<br>responsibility or challenge of kind of<br>intellectual translation actually entail<br>I don't want to call anyone with with<br>research projects past present or future<br>hold on due to a few projects as I go<br>along it's actually going to be much<br>more selective it also extrapolate a<br>series of questions that you've got<br>underlined on this slide we strike me as<br>um sort of warm-ups of questions I keep<br>running into and this write me as<br>questions that resonate with some<br>alternative big topics what are<br>identities uh what does that entity have<br>to do with the language or with the<br>domain of of sort of politicized<br>language and thirdly what might lie<br>Beyond or outside language so these are<br>some of my three sort of clusters of<br>questions I need to 15 today now if you<br>just look at the topics I'm working on I<br>think you want this advice to hear that<br>I'm probably not the most popular guy as<br>far as the political right is concerned<br>right if you look at questions<br>a type of political sociology I want to<br>talk about they come here could be<br>relatively it's all apologetically<br>political<br>ity but it's not going to be an<br>should escape from the conversation of<br>data of reflection on the concepts of<br>all the concepts we work with and we<br>view the world three and it will turn<br>out that it's probably not only the you<br>know the political rights of life I have<br>to say<br>um<br>it's quite possible that some people<br>identify much closer with the Left End<br>of the middle Spectrum might also<br>disagree or raise some eyebrows with<br>with some relation to some of the things<br>are identities<br>and this does take me back to to where I<br>started with um actually at the time uh<br>there was a well-established consensus<br>in social sciences that identity<br>I think it is an act of constructing a<br>categorical difference between us and<br>them that's the argument so that has<br>between two categories also we're here<br>and then over there<br>and that right from the start this<br>driving is particularly convincing or<br>useful uh this is a good viruses they<br>actually got so trivial we really need<br>to be able to do more than that you know<br>of course yeah categories yourself and<br>slide to my mind one of the most<br>significant intellectuals of the 20th<br>century uh the Belgium born French<br>Anthropologist called the biggest house<br>um he was kind of talking about<br>classification for a long time so it's<br>another chance the human mind has a<br>propensity to categorize the world and<br>of course self other us and then our<br>basic building blocks of thoughts of<br>cultural discourse of the things we say<br>is the relationship between different<br>categories that we construct it's not<br>self other than that it's about how do<br>we Define the relationship between us<br>and somebody else<br>and that really is sort of a Quantum<br>Leap to my mind in terms of you know how<br>we might think about it<br>children<br>yeah one particular form of<br>that it's obvious and it's sort of<br>rigidity obviously it works<br>it works strongly clearly opposed<br>categories and in that discourse turned<br>out to do a little more than just that<br>even that form of politics was operating<br>with several different ways of<br>classification of classified in the<br>world and I called them structural<br>possibilities now it's going to get a<br>little more technical before becoming<br>less technical but I I just want to sort<br>of tell a story really<br>I was very lucky to be drawn into a<br>project led by two eminent uh<br>European anthropologists get down and<br>over anyway people doing very similar<br>work they were also thinking about<br>classifications they're also thinking<br>about self other relationships<br>and they were also saying actually this<br>idea that identity requires otherwise is<br>pretty pointless it's it's borderline<br>trivial it's so obvious we need to we<br>need to go far beyond that and their way<br>of going beyond that basically Insight<br>was to talk about grammars of identity<br>now again I became part of that project<br>and since then I've been more than<br>persuaded that terminology was much<br>better than mine so I'm using their term<br>grammar of identical grammar mass of our<br>is all about the relationship between<br>self and other<br>family Cambridge distinguished three<br>such grammars and I'm going to try and<br>be as quick as I can and summarize them<br>the first one is what they call a baby<br>grammar or orientalist an orientalists<br>it's really the crudest possible way of<br>defining the relationship between self<br>and others saying there's a category<br>eight a category B there's nothing in<br>between there's no confusion there's no<br>movement these are diametrically opposed<br>from the top<br>now we know that the<br>applications are all around us we<br>but actually if we're careful enough we<br>will see the same crime Network near<br>the left-hand spectate of the uh<br>the point here is we also all also know<br>that the world is a little more<br>complicated<br>than you know this grant suggests this<br>is the kind of stuff that translates<br>into good versus evil US versus them if<br>you're one of us you can't be one of<br>them that kind of thought<br>and yet you know why does this grammar<br>acquires so much political traction<br>what does it work<br>second grammar<br>um<br>referring to that slide by myself the<br>goal is a grammar of segmentation or a<br>secondary ground and it kind of it works<br>for a similar principle but it has<br>several two African scales as in words<br>so it starts at the bottom when it says<br>building on that topological work that<br>was developing in East Africa before<br>this it sort of says the local lineages<br>think of it and my for example<br>Define themselves in opposition to each<br>other why they naturally your lineage we<br>we struggled we compete a lot of<br>resources<br>for those images those competing images<br>are capable of forming ahead of this<br>coinclusive category in group in the<br>sort of term social psychologists right<br>which is four and if you look at four or<br>four is of course by five<br>on a higher level of sort of belonging<br>or the higher level of geographical<br>understanding now you've got one further<br>era and four and five margins two and<br>the point is 0.5 merging into two<br>acquire a new opposition which is three<br>so you cannot get the sense of alliances<br>shifting depending on their point of<br>reference<br>um again this sort of comes from a<br>particular contributions<br>of politics today you might think of<br>local politics Regional politics<br>National politics you might wonder what<br>there might be aware of the<br>supranational category which would<br>correspond to one on this on this<br>diagram<br>a little bit like that concentric<br>circles you might also Imagine a<br>hierarchy<br>now this set of grammar they call it<br>accomplishments is not actually<br>particularly interested in the outside<br>it's not actually all that preoccupied<br>with the other with an out group well<br>this is all about is someone in power<br>pronouncing for everyone located further<br>down the hierarchy or more towards the<br>edges of the concentric circuits and say<br>you really want of us you're part of us<br>although not granted the same degree of<br>decision-making Powers as I have sitting<br>at the effects of hierarchy inside so<br>three different grammars according to<br>family and in England I think they've<br>been proven rights many times in my own<br>workers but I keep discovering examples<br>of this but there's more<br>um there's certainly other plans and<br>this is why not it's an exhausted list I<br>think okay let's keep thinking of a as<br>self and B as the other in other things<br>grammar four would be about an overlap<br>you might not think about multiculturals<br>there's lots of celebrations of<br>multiculturalisms or lived<br>multiculturalism where actually some<br>acknowledgments of the complexities of<br>some other relationships becomes<br>possible when people say actually these<br>categories are I'm sort of artificial<br>Distortion because our lives are more<br>closely interval and these you know it's<br>building blocks overlap and create<br>becomes<br>a number of B in other words a member of<br>the M group transforms themselves<br>but by migrating away Blast by by<br>group transforms themselves into a<br>network of their group think of<br>assimilation think of if you like<br>citizenship tests<br>think of religions with Evangelical<br>missionary traditions in any case<br>there's a very different cultural logic<br>a very different cultural evaluation of<br>the transformation thing taking place in<br>summer so what about sensor foreign<br>context<br>people<br>um<br>so far this is all fairly basic stuff<br>it's really about kind of<br>campus and their relationships now I<br>want to say we need to think a bit more<br>broadly we need to think about<br>classification as part of language as<br>part of something bigger<br>but absolutely interesting simple<br>existence<br>possible sense<br>and I guess I'd like to tell you about<br>one of my my favorite books um<br>by Michael Bennett he was teaching at<br>Northborough University for a long time<br>uh he wrote the same most significant<br>book about nationalism uh over the last<br>it's all around us<br>the structures Under The Lights we will<br>pass it without nonsense think of all<br>the flags silently waves<br>think of how to use a structure so<br>splitting the world into domestically<br>the foreign use whoever questions like<br>that's just you know some of the<br>structure of our lives and then you can<br>see some on rethinking them think of the<br>the kind of implicit politics of<br>sporting competitions who have come<br>coming up ask yourself the kind of logic<br>weakness of that think of um<br>important example of what he calls<br>National exits which are sort of<br>rhetorical strategies by which we point<br>at ourselves<br>how we enjoy personal programs we are<br>they Us and Them that's part of the<br>parcel of building course by now<br>nationalism<br>Beyond<br>you know the sort of pointing into<br>geographical space that is is absolutely<br>ruining the capturing and I've asked<br>myself along with calling some of them<br>are on the live stream might it be that<br>we don't just point the geographical<br>space but then we also point in time the<br>point of the thing is in other words we<br>use cultural memories in most points and<br>we produce National identification so<br>that action is not just a point and<br>explanation through maps of the<br>organization of news through the<br>personal pronouns through how we<br>distinguish between here and over there<br>but we also invoke particular models in<br>history and we might call that the form<br>of temporal the exits building okay<br>again<br>um<br>of kind of<br>philosophy of science let's go with that<br>let's go with the methodology for<br>psychology<br>and<br>yeah<br>um particular approach with you which is<br>has probably shaped my thinking more<br>than ever and another approach it was<br>called critical discourse analysis<br>of a language question uh critical<br>discourse analysis basically it talks<br>about a language as a form of social<br>practice<br>it says there's no such thing as a text<br>or an options that doesn't have a social<br>history it's a very very important<br>now I think particularly uh influence<br>probably the most prominent persons of<br>written within this tradition of<br>research but it's a it's a vast kind of<br>array of different approaches but they<br>also share this particular understanding<br>language is never innocent it's another<br>way of talking about it comes from<br>places and it has an impact on the world<br>whatever you and I say or write<br>we need to understand what we should try<br>and understand that in its social and<br>political<br>and we should also try and interrogate<br>how the things we say about impact back<br>on the world around us<br>now it follows that language is always<br>socialization and so it's it's analysis<br>is stop worrying whatever you might say<br>why would we say when are we going to be<br>realize it there's a politics to the<br>things<br>and this applies to the heart sizes as<br>much as it doesn't social spices<br>there is one stepping away from that you<br>can take that technological conclusion<br>and it causes some really challenging<br>questions about our sort of long<br>inherent hypnosis of objectivity and<br>subjectivity for instance what do we do<br>with that how do we judge the reader the<br>possibility of an account of the social<br>world if anything I say comes from a<br>particular phase as much as what<br>politicians say comes from a particular<br>place and acts on the world so that's<br>some really really profound questions or<br>philosophical science not just<br>philosophers and social science the free<br>of symptoms of science as well as<br>Communications and others now let me<br>um<br>populism does it creates a sort of false<br>proximity a false popularity between one<br>particular motivation and the election<br>and it also argues that after all the<br>other propositions are completely<br>detached from reality there are a lot of<br>touch with our concerns without fears<br>we're not excited but there's that one<br>person who really gets it never mind all<br>the the differences of wealth of<br>privilege of stages of power that person<br>constructs themselves as being really<br>touched close to familiar with our<br>concerns now CDA in many ridiculous<br>attention to the language he's able to<br>show us<br>how this this kind of populist politics<br>actually works wide operates why how it<br>appeals to these audiences and I would<br>argue that practice of speaking or<br>allowing the election to think of a<br>prime minister by their first name is<br>populism in language practice that's how<br>it features<br>it goes us over all the things again<br>wealth stateless privilege but provides<br>the electorate from the prime ministers<br>in question<br>Okay so<br>I've talked about language as a form of<br>social practice just on the previous<br>slides<br>um if I was just one type of social<br>practice uh it doesn't follow that all<br>types of social practices are linguistic<br>of coming in investing formats now<br>certain things that lie outside of<br>language and I want to think my way a<br>little through that now what lies Beyond<br>this awesome end of people's talk and<br>texts<br>um now social sciences of course the<br>more people say they do and what they<br>actually do are two very very different<br>things but that's not that's what was<br>being used here<br>um but I'd like to sort of read like<br>sort of rethink that that insights<br>through the particular ideas such as<br>sharing now several excited about<br>talking about people that description<br>the belgians or French social<br>Anthropologist another thing we did with<br>it is<br>he invoked work by a Swiss name list by<br>on this line<br>and to say that I've introduced a<br>distinction to the study language<br>um long it refers to languages as a<br>system as a system a language system<br>with all these rules of groundwork or<br>syntax and so on but all of the other<br>hand refers to particular utterances<br>it's the things we say it's a sort of<br>resonates very strongly<br>with 10 words lcos official languages<br>German he has the level of long as we<br>need to learn right our linguistic<br>system is the German language<br>um how we speak on the other hand tends<br>to be a long way removed from that so<br>our ability to pass in terms of<br>synthetics and Antics vocabulary<br>sentence structure even tenses a long<br>it's dramatic understanding is better<br>different things<br>we can do more than that with this<br>distinction between what I want to<br>suggest to you next is that actually the<br>way in which identity is stimulus think<br>of all the circle of readers yes<br>constructs a view of the world those<br>views of the world can really stand in<br>Stark contradiction to what people do<br>and how they live their life so I'll<br>just give you two brief examples<br>I'm actually um this is a section of the<br>map of Australia and the slide is cut<br>off the east of it uh this with his is a<br>province called Corinthia this is a<br>border to Slovenia most of our work has<br>been on all students as you say and<br>there's some really amazing examples of<br>how kind of ideology and everything<br>social relations can really speak very<br>different languages okay really look<br>very very different I'll just give you<br>one example<br>um clinic and also updated to many<br>recalls an incident by imagine<br>this particular part of Austria and its<br>bordering regions in Slovenia this is<br>strongly contested territory long<br>history of<br>uh political context of a space of a<br>language or the belonging they're going<br>back a long time since the late making<br>hundreds this is really acquired it's<br>really quiet I make it we're like<br>dropping political traction there's only<br>aren't conflict<br>um leading deep wounds on both sides of<br>the boundary of the Border even though<br>those have been possible to some extent<br>since uh something is EU accession in<br>2004. so these days things are not quite<br>years ago the memories of all this<br>looks very different from the kind of<br>ideological orderliness of this person<br>is constructing or pronouncing that this<br>is genetics German speaking German<br>example right now<br>I spent 10 years on a project with a<br>former colleague David Parker<br>learning sociologists we worked um<br>in the parts of Birmingham<br>um partly from the way that they're<br>having the geographic films we worked a<br>lot on this particular part of<br>Birmingham but when we started about<br>2006 have you gave me this this will be<br>called some very very adverse terrible<br>reputation the local and the national<br>price had constructed this area as being<br>a local area Dangerous Ground so let us<br>feeding of breathing parallel lives you<br>No Doubt but there was another side<br>another side there was at least as<br>pronounced and it was all about people<br>crossing boundaries uh speaking between<br>categories living between categories<br>establishing friendships business<br>relationships crossing boundaries and<br>ease and doing so all the time so again<br>the ideological system around this area<br>stands the complete contradiction to the<br>um<br>I'm coming towards the end of the things<br>you've been pleased to hear<br>all right so what I've got it I've<br>talked about category relations I talked<br>about<br>embedded in<br>larger simple existence language and<br>others now we're just asking more<br>fundamental question yes I know that<br>before based on some of my friends but<br>subjected to the person on this slide<br>was the greatest co4<br>I think anyone working on the areas that<br>provide welcome recognizes him as one of<br>the most important Vehicles I've ever<br>uh lots of his work is extraordinarily<br>widely quoted<br>and there are others around and so I<br>might be spaces barely needs to mention<br>is that identities are two things<br>they're all about power and how each of<br>us is positioned in our relationships in<br>the structures of powers and you've got<br>past general race ethnicity sexuality so<br>on and so forth we get given places in<br>the world let's call them asita's<br>subject positions<br>and we don't get to choose most of them<br>even in other times of postmodern<br>consumerism you don't get to choose most<br>of our social positions they have to ask<br>themselves to us they Place Us in the<br>social world<br>now among us we've come today and right<br>side we've got to talk about it this is<br>this is the importance of the eei agenda<br>and another and other initiatives again<br>with something that is finally arrived<br>in the academy<br>but then there's a second aspect the<br>same information so you just your tools<br>uh work and I suspect that this is why<br>we don't talk about it as much as we<br>should he says I know it's very<br>important<br>final positions different individuals in<br>vastly different ways<br>but it never succeeds at fixing people's<br>entirely<br>it doesn't because life is too<br>complicated priority isn't too messy and<br>however constrained by configurations<br>and structures of how we are there's<br>always some space for agency a space of<br>agency that varies depending on our<br>subject positions but it's there<br>now I feel that we've forgotten about<br>the second part of the equation and I<br>feel that for all these accomplishments<br>make that subject in very very different<br>I want to now push even further out so I<br>thought that the categories that talk<br>about language I've talked about the<br>combinations between systems and<br>Investments of everyday life and I want<br>to talk about what else we need to<br>factor into conversations about identity<br>and I want to talk about real<br>nationalism in particular<br>to that particular Snapchat<br>agricultural Fields right that's how we<br>meet in the distance to be a sort of<br>medieval Church<br>um you're looking at more of the<br>Publications with the highest complexes<br>leave lots in the country<br>you're not looking under that an area<br>that sort of meets the profile of being<br>a really deprived working class<br>neighborhood that results against it<br>against its own operation through<br>through Predator that's what we're<br>looking after you're looking at an area<br>where most people own their own houses<br>yes they have been affected by austerity<br>as we all have yes of course the<br>cost of living crisis<br>but these people usually most of the<br>people live in their own their own<br>houses involve three four cars in their<br>driveways a lot of them can afford a<br>costly to my own absurds as family like<br>motorcycles<br>I I don't see there's a sort of<br>quintessential areas these into the kind<br>of Working Class People that has been a<br>like that<br>generate 63 64 probably aggressive<br>process<br>my degree that we need to look at that<br>now if it wasn't for the cloud formation<br>and it goes on Horizon you could be<br>looking for thinking that these two<br>images of God Mustang whatsoever to do<br>with each other<br>the separated they were separatism from<br>years ago probably about 500 meters<br>now this is what agricultural land looks<br>like on the bulldozer's life<br>so now you're asking<br>well let's walk<br>in another 500 yards getting six seven<br>hundred yards and this is what you see<br>why now I happen to know that<br>this happened it has become more of that<br>now what am I saying to you this big<br>thing in an area that I've seen I should<br>have said it is in this place to see<br>barely any if any inward migration right<br>so this again doesn't fit the sort of<br>stereotype of operation it's important<br>that we've all acquired working custom<br>units is rattling enough and then having<br>what I want to suggest is that there are<br>wider social conditions that not all of<br>them sort of easily uh interpret them<br>well we'll even leave it through our<br>established sort of<br>analytical Frameworks what we're used to<br>thinking about some certain amount of<br>deprivation as a relief for political<br>choices that matters of money matters is<br>understands here well I think this<br>allows us too is that there's another<br>form of deprivation that affects all<br>kinds of pregnancy so let's call this<br>ecological or environmental or<br>infrastructure of their profession<br>General sociologists and Leaders name<br>but it's I think it's written about this<br>much much<br>better than that and he describes areas<br>like this as as typical or Vehicles the<br>but feeling a profound sense of
