academic party to<br>preside and so we have with us um<br>Professor Sally McCormack the head of<br>Department uh we have apologies from<br>Professor Helen Nicholson the DVC<br>academic who is unwell this evening but<br>we are very privileged to have our vice<br>Chancellor Professor David Murdock<br>altered to Milwaukee or otago it's our<br>privilege to have you here David who<br>will be presenting the uh Carl Smith<br>Middle to Peter after his lecture<br>so it's a it's a wonderful celebration<br>that's my great pleasure to share this<br>uh celebration of outstanding research<br>achievement with you all friends and<br>whale have our medical recipient members<br>of our university community are citizens<br>of Dunedin and the region and people<br>zooming into the life of the screen from<br>around the world so hopefully all of the<br>AV is working well for this so know my<br>haramay welcome<br>a particularly warm welcome tonight goes<br>to Peter's supporters and family<br>um special greetings to your wife<br>Gabriel and daughter's Rita and now who<br>are here tonight welcome I hope this is<br>a fun night for you all and uh to your<br>other whanau who are online hello to you<br>all uh also greetings this is an<br>International Event to your collaborator<br>James Murphy who is visiting from<br>Australia and other departmental<br>colleagues and I understand that there's<br>going to be a nice celebration with some<br>of your family and colleagues after the<br>event<br>enjoyable duties that I have the<br>privilege to perform in my role each<br>year and I have um I both oversee the<br>the selection panel but this is the<br>ceremonial part that's much more fun<br>because the selection process for these<br>Awards is quite cruel and given the uh<br>the level of competition<br>now the order of Ceremonies is that I<br>will say some words and then I'll invite<br>Professor McCormick to introduce the<br>lecture<br>following this I will summarize the<br>significance give a voted thanks and<br>then let's say provided the lecture is<br>suitably impressive so this is a test<br>leader I will then invite the vice<br>Chancellor to present you with the award<br>and<br>uh the middle that will end the formal<br>proceedings<br>um but we'll assure and we'll also<br>ensure that your achievements are<br>recognized when you are presented again<br>with a certificate um at the University<br>staff Awards function on Wednesday<br>uh before I give you some background I<br>just wanted to highlight as well that um<br>this is coming at a very timely process<br>because we have just um launched our<br>annual research highlights publication<br>for the University heikitinga and in<br>fact this year's<br>um Edition is entitled to talented<br>Futures there are a few additions here<br>perhaps for your family to take if they<br>wish to First and Peter's award is<br>recognized in this official document of<br>the University<br>um it's particularly nice because we<br>have focused on early in mid-career<br>researchers in this Edition and this<br>carlsman medal is specifically awarded<br>for people in the earlier stages of<br>their career<br>um for those of you who cannot get a<br>copy or for those of you uh viewing<br>online<br>um it is actually available online also<br>if you search heikiting<br>um before I ask Sally to introduce Peter<br>a little about the award and the medal<br>he will receive and the names so why are<br>rohith trust award and a Carl Smith<br>medal<br>well one is for the money and one is for<br>the glory the rohith trust was<br>established in 1964 to support the work<br>of the universe<br>um the work of the university and it was<br>established by Carl Smith so Carl Smith<br>and rohith Trust are intimately linked<br>cal Smith was a prominent Dunedin<br>businessman and a member of the<br>University Council and he endowed the<br>through the rohith trust a five thousand<br>dollar research support award that bears<br>the trust name<br>at the same time the university<br>commissioned the Carl Smith Midland in<br>his honor<br>it gives<br>and in keeping the Kyle Smith name it<br>gives the university a good opportunity<br>to recognize the contribution of Sir<br>Carl and his wife lady Catherine that<br>they made over many years after coming<br>to New Zealand from the Family Estate of<br>rohith and Birmingham<br>um and the connection of Birmingham is<br>to the Cadbury uh Empire so<br>um<br>that family connection to the University<br>of the ward continues um and until very<br>recently uh so Carl's daughter Catherine<br>who grew up in Dunedin and spent her<br>golden years in the otago region was a<br>regular attendee at these Awards<br>now so Carl was also a well-known author<br>in addition to his business and con<br>Community contributions<br>um he was known not so much for his book<br>Sweet Success the the history of the<br>chocolate maker Cadbury fry Hudson<br>published in 1968 but also for a quirky<br>and humorous Tome called New Zealand<br>from n to zed that has become somewhat<br>of a collector's piece for its<br>interesting insights into mid 20th<br>century New Zealand culture and Society<br>now the book is long out of print but<br>one of the things that we will present<br>to you Peter tonight is a rare and hard<br>to come by edition of the book it will<br>be unique because there are ongoing and<br>active searches on trade me and other<br>and other sources and the Regent book<br>fair gets scowled every year to try and<br>find some additional copies I think<br>we're down to two or three left but you<br>will receive one of these uh rare<br>editions as well as your middle as well<br>as your prize so look this is not just a<br>double award it's a triple award<br>um so anyway that's that's the order of<br>proceedings we'll get Sally up then<br>we'll have your lecture and then we'll<br>present your award so without further<br>Ado uh please accept our congratulations<br>congratulations on behalf of the<br>university and I'd like now like to<br>invite Sally as be to Senator Department<br>to introduce his talk to you no later<br>though<br>welcome everyone it's really good to see<br>you here tonight it's a bit of a crowd<br>here tonight a warm welcome to Peter's<br>family his colleagues and his friends<br>who are here to support him and<br>delivering his carlsmith medal tonight<br>I'm Sally McCormick head of biochemistry<br>and I have the great pleasure of being<br>able to introduce Peter tonight<br>so just a few um things about the<br>Peter's background before I tell you a<br>little bit about lecture<br>so uh Peter is an otago graduate he's<br>remained very loyal to otago he<br>completed his BSC honors and<br>biochemistry in 2002 then stayed on to<br>do a PhD in the department with John<br>cupfield and then further stayed on to<br>do three years with postdoctoral studies<br>and the lab of Catherine day before<br>moving to the U.S to the<br>Sanford Burnham Medical Research<br>Institute where he took up a<br>postdoctoral fellowship there in 2010.<br>he returned home in 2013 on a<br>prestigious role for Discovery<br>fellowship and subsequently went about<br>building his own Laboratory<br>he actually won the early research<br>career award for distinction and<br>research at the University here in 2016<br>and in that same year it was promoted to<br>a senior research fellow and the<br>following year he was appointed to a<br>senior lectureship position in the<br>department<br>he was promoted to associate professor<br>in 2020 and this year he was appointed<br>as our associate dean of research for<br>the school of biomedical Sciences a long<br>list of achievements and a very short<br>space of time<br>over the course of his career he's<br>established himself an international<br>reputation as a leading structural<br>biologist this means that he solves<br>structures in his case three-dimensional<br>structures of proteins<br>this is important because proteins are<br>the workhorses inside our cells<br>they tell ourselves how to respond to<br>our environment they tell ourselves<br>whether to die live or multiply<br>and by understanding the structure of<br>proteins we can learn a lot about<br>proteins the active Parts they're<br>partners that they interact with and<br>what switches them on and what switches<br>them off<br>and also the effect of mutations that<br>there might be in these proteins<br>Peter has solved I think I've lost count<br>but it must be something over 20<br>structures I believe<br>uh and in doing so has learned uh has<br>has taught us how proteins talk to each<br>other to facilitate cell signaling but<br>his work actually has a lot of<br>implications uh around drug design<br>because proteins are increasingly<br>becoming targets for drugs and so if you<br>can understand how proteins interact<br>with these drugs you can make for a more<br>effective design<br>he's been very prolific in his<br>publishing over 50 papers invariably and<br>very high quality journals such as a<br>number of papers in the nature Suite of<br>journals which are among the highest<br>quality journals in science<br>and this is no significant feat in a<br>field that requires a lot of<br>experimental work to actually get<br>published he's highly cited several of<br>his articles have been chosen as cover<br>articles which means the editors think<br>they are a really broad interest to<br>people<br>he's highly sought after as a<br>international speaker<br>and uh<br>has just been elected president of the<br>New Zealand Society for biochemistry and<br>electabology probably means more<br>conference organization I suspect<br>um I just wanted to finish up by just<br>making a comment about Peter as a person<br>I recently saw Amari proverb or<br>whakatoki which I think plays to a<br>couple of Key properties that Peter has<br>which makes some very special<br>and the whakataki goes kauri takumala<br>ekordo more Tona akirika and that<br>translates to the kumara doesn't speak<br>of its own sweetness and what it's<br>really saying is it's about being humble<br>and it's about ensuring the success of<br>others and I think Peter has done a<br>great job of that and Richard already<br>sort of alluded to it in his words Peter<br>has made and there's a couple examples<br>Peter has made sure that his<br>collaborators and his colleagues get<br>access to all of the latest Technologies<br>and structural biology this is seen and<br>has huge efforts to access both the<br>Australian signatron and the cryo em<br>facility in Australia organizing visits<br>there for his collaborators<br>um and also through the way he trains<br>the students he's a very careful um and<br>considerate trainer of students ensuring<br>their own success as well as his own so<br>he is we are very lucky to have so on<br>someone so collegial uh in the<br>department and so successful in the<br>department and I um we're just happy<br>that Peter calls biochemistry as home so<br>uh with no further Ado I'm going to now<br>hand over to Peter to talk to us about<br>his structures his switches and cancer<br>signaling<br>that's that's good<br>um<br>thank you very much for the invitation<br>oh sorry the this uh opportunity to<br>speak to you today um it's great to see<br>um so many familiar faces family<br>um who've helped all the way a lot all<br>the way along colleagues who I've worked<br>with directly colleagues who have helped<br>just by being there and family online<br>who are watching so it's really exciting<br>to be able to talk to you about some of<br>our work today so<br>my talk today is entitled structures and<br>switches cancer signaling at the<br>molecular level which will hopefully<br>become clearer as we go along but what<br>we're really interested in in my lab is<br>thinking about what how a cell<br>communicates within itself and so how it<br>makes those decisions that Sally's been<br>talking about how it decides whether it<br>should be growing whether it should stop<br>growing whether it should change into<br>another cell type because when those<br>processes go awry that's when we get<br>diseases such as cancer<br>and so where we're going to start is<br>this picture of a couple of cancer cells<br>and so these are healer cancer cells so<br>they uh take this picture is taken with<br>an electron microscope looking at the<br>surface of these cells so healer cells<br>were derived from a cancer patient<br>called Henrietta Lacks and they actually<br>under have underpinned pretty much all<br>of our modern human cell biology because<br>these cells were the first cells that we<br>learned to be able to grow in the lab<br>and so the reason we were able to do<br>this is that these cells were basically<br>immortalized so they will just keep<br>proliferating under when even when the<br>conditions aren't quite right for them<br>they'll keep proliferating that enabled<br>the early researchers 50 60 years ago to<br>work out techniques to grow cells in the<br>lab and that's underwritten basically<br>all of the work that we do in cell<br>biology now but underwriting that is the<br>fact that they are Immortal they've lost<br>that communication inside that tells<br>them we should stop communicate we<br>should stop proliferating<br>and we need to stop growing<br>at that stage and so that's really what<br>my lab is interested in what's happening<br>inside the cell that is allowing it to<br>communicate and realize this is not this<br>is what we should be doing and when that<br>process goes wrong<br>why we get diseases such as cancer so<br>this is looking at a signaling pathway<br>and it's probably simplest form that we<br>can we can imagine<br>the cell might receive some sort of<br>signal for it might be uh it might touch<br>another cell or there might be a growth<br>factor that comes along in the blood or<br>it might be something that happens<br>within the cell this turns one protein<br>off sorry from its off form to its on<br>form so we're going red to Green like a<br>traffic light here what that protein can<br>then go and do is go and turn on another<br>protein<br>and so this is a very simple simple<br>signaling pathway there's just two<br>components but this in cells this can<br>have multiple different steps and<br>multiple different uh kind of crosstalks<br>which we'll talk about once that protein<br>is on it might go off and do any number<br>of different things so it might go into<br>the nucleus of the cell where it can<br>control what genes are being expressed<br>turn things on or off it might tell the<br>cell that it should move away and become<br>motile and move to a different part of<br>the the body or it might go off and turn<br>other proteins on and off on the cell so<br>it might tell the signaling pathway hey<br>we've got enough signal here let's turn<br>it off<br>and so<br>understanding these signaling Pathways<br>obviously gets more and more complex<br>when we think about all of the things<br>that's going on in the cellular<br>environment and the things that cells<br>are experiencing so they have to<br>integrate a huge number of different<br>signals signals that are telling cells<br>whether they should move telling cells<br>whether they should change into a<br>different cell type or proliferate and<br>so even in this relatively simplified<br>form things start to look relatively<br>complicated<br>when we've got a nice clean picture like<br>this though we we could think of this<br>signaling within a cell as something<br>like a wiring diagram for the physicist<br>amongst in the audience<br>um<br>unfortunately whereas a wiring diagram<br>is relatively clean what we're dealing<br>with in cellular signaling is much more<br>something like this so it's a system<br>where it's probably functional in some<br>sense<br>um but there's a lot of things going on<br>there that we don't really understand<br>yet we don't quite understand what's<br>connected to what and within that whole<br>kind of mess there's probably some<br>things that are broken and or may become<br>broken and so diagnosing how that's<br>going wrong it gets really quite<br>complicated and so what we're trying to<br>understand is when these switches go<br>wrong how does it change the<br>communication Within These signaling<br>pathways<br>so one of the ways that proteins<br>communicate and get switched on and off<br>is this process called<br>post-translational modification so the<br>post-translational that you don't need<br>to worry about that too much that's just<br>talking about after the protein is made<br>so the protein is sitting around inside<br>the cell it can be turned on by lots of<br>different things but two of the main<br>ways that proteins are turned on or off<br>are these processes called<br>phosphorylation so a phosphate atom gets<br>put onto a<br>residue within the protein or you can<br>have a another protein get put onto the<br>protein called a ubiquitin molecule and<br>so both of these things the important<br>thing about a signal signal like this is<br>you have ways that it can go onto<br>proteins and ways that it can come off<br>because if you have a signal stuck on<br>that's not necessarily going to be a<br>very good way of controlling a cell you<br>want reversibility<br>and so there's proteins in the cell that<br>write those modifications onto other<br>proteins and there's proteins in the<br>cell that can erase those modifications<br>and so<br>in this kind of simplified drawing I've<br>shown you that they turn on or off<br>proteins but obviously proteins are more<br>kind of complicated than these jelly<br>beans that I'm showing you here and so<br>what we really need to do to understand<br>how those phosphorylations and eubic<br>coordinations can turn on and off<br>proteins as understand them add a bit<br>more detail<br>and so as Sally said what we spend a lot<br>of our time doing is trying to<br>understand what the three-dimensional<br>structures of proteins are and so this<br>is kind of on the left hand side is the<br>Jelly Bean that I've already shown you<br>on the right hand side is a closer<br>representation of what a protein<br>structure really looks like and this is<br>a relatively well understood relatively<br>simple protein but it looks pretty<br>complex because it's a kind of a<br>compilation of hundreds or thousands of<br>atoms<br>um all sitting in in relation to each<br>other so understanding exactly their 3D<br>positions can be really useful which<br>I'll show in a second even people who<br>spend all day looking at protein<br>structures that's not a very<br>decipherable picture so often what we do<br>is look at protein structures in this<br>kind of cartoon form which looks a bit<br>more attractive in the middle and so<br>that's what I'm going to be showing you<br>most of the protein structures are going<br>to be in that cartoon form that we look<br>at today<br>so how do we actually do well how do we<br>actually solve that structure which<br>you're seeing on the right hand side<br>there so we use this process called<br>x-ray crystallography is one of the ways<br>we solve protein structures and up till<br>recently has really been the predominant<br>way that we solve these<br>three-dimensional structures and so<br>x-ray crystallography as the name<br>suggests at the start of it we need a<br>crystal to start start off this process<br>and what is shown on the on the left<br>hand side here is a crystal of a protein<br>so this is one of those things that has<br>hundreds or thousands of atoms if we<br>incubate it in the right chemical<br>conditions and just happen to have the<br>right concentration of protein and all<br>sorts of different chemicals and you're<br>standing on your left leg and you've<br>scratched your right ear at the right<br>time you might get a crystal like this<br>grow and so this is this can be quite a<br>trial and error process but if this<br>happens what you then have to do is get<br>something that's about the size of the<br>eye the eye of a needle or probably<br>smaller than that fish this Crystal out<br>and after probably smashing a few of<br>them you can freeze one of these<br>crystals and then shoot it with a really<br>intense x-ray beam<br>and so if all these stars align what you<br>might get is a diffraction pattern which<br>is those spots in the middle of the<br>um of the slide there and through some a<br>bunch of maths what you can then do is<br>calculate a three-dimensional map of<br>where all the atoms in that protein<br>actually sit within that Crystal and so<br>then you can then build a model of where<br>all the atoms within that map<br>um lie and this is this is pretty much<br>like um setting a puzzle um when Nell<br>was young issues to tell me about how I<br>talked about how I was fitting my doing<br>my puzzles dad which is kind of pretty<br>much what it is it's pretty fun if you<br>have an electron density map like this<br>fitting a model in there<br>and so this process can be quite<br>involved and it really involves quite a<br>lot of Technology as well as I alluded<br>to<br>we have to set up this is quite a trial<br>and error process growing protein<br>crystals so we use this robotics to set<br>up tiny tiny trials we also use this<br>Imaging system which is our Rock imager<br>to take pictures of these crystals as<br>they go along so we've had really good<br>support from the large equipment fund at<br>the University and helping us purchase<br>this Imaging system and it's been really<br>a boon for the area of protein<br>crystallography at otago and also<br>support from Lottery's health for both<br>the robot and the Imaging system has<br>helped us along the way<br>um and then to shoot these x-rays uh<br>shoot these crystals what we have to do<br>is take them to the synchrotron in<br>Melbourne and so this is a source of<br>really powerful x-rays<br>um and it um basically allows us to<br>solve Crystal structures that we<br>wouldn't be able to solve using any<br>x-ray Source in New Zealand so we get<br>good support from New Zealand<br>synchrotron Group which<br>otago is a member of to be able to go<br>and both visit on-site and train<br>students at the synchrotron or just send<br>our crystals there and shoot them<br>so before we even get to that stage<br>though there's just a huge it's it's<br>hard to kind of under undersell how much<br>work goes into making the protein to be<br>able to grow those crystals so this just<br>um huge amounts of work that go on from<br>staff and students in the lab not all of<br>it involves probably quite unsafely<br>crawling underneath our fplc machines<br>there but um basically I'm going to show<br>you a few structures later on in the<br>lecture in the lecture but really<br>there's just huge amounts of work that<br>go into even being able to make the<br>protein in the first place let alone<br>convince it to form crystals<br>and so<br>it's a huge it can be a huge amount of<br>work to solve a crystal structure um so<br>why do we go to all this trouble<br>um and so as some of you will know one<br>of the most obvious ways that we can use<br>these three-dimensional structures is to<br>be able to design better drugs and so<br>just to illustrate this concept quite<br>often what a cancer cell might do is it<br>might pick up a mutation and a gene that<br>encodes a kinase and so a kinase is one<br>of those proteins that puts it's one of<br>those pencils from the slide earlier it<br>writes a phosphate modification onto<br>other proteins<br>and so this what this can do is if this<br>mutation basically turns on that kinase<br>and makes it Go and phosphorylate things<br>kind of out of control then you can have<br>a situation such as uncontrolled you get<br>uncontrolled cell growth the<br>accelerator's stuck on and it'll just<br>keep proliferating out of control but if<br>we can solve a three-dimensional<br>structure of that kinase protein what we<br>can do this is a thinner template that's<br>kind of knowing the structure of the<br>lock to be able to fit a key in to<br>design a drug to sit in the active site<br>of that kinase protein it stops it from<br>being able to bind the molecules that it<br>needs to bind to phosphorylate things<br>and so that's an effect of way to<br>improve drugs by knowing exactly how<br>they fit in three dimensions inside the<br>kinase protein<br>but that's not we do have projects in<br>the lab that are doing this sort of<br>thing that's not really what I want to<br>talk to you about today what I want to<br>talk to you about is more how we can a<br>bit more holistically use solving<br>protein structures to understand more<br>about how cells work because that's<br>going to kind of bring the camera back a<br>little bit and think about what areas we<br>might be able to be able to develop<br>drugs in the future understand where<br>things are going wrong in cancers that<br>we already have and understanding<br>whether we can Target particular protein<br>switches in a better manner<br>so these are the three examples we're<br>just going to give you some brief<br>details about for the rest of the<br>lecture and so the first one starts off<br>thinking about taking a drug that we<br>already know is really effective it's<br>been used for decades<br>um but it was not really understood what<br>was happening Downstream<br>um to connect to signaling Pathways that<br>made it effective<br>and so this story starts like all good<br>stories in Madagascar so on the left<br>hand side there is a madagascan<br>Periwinkle and if you extract compounds<br>called vinca alkaloids out of the leaves<br>of these the Madagascar and Periwinkle<br>you have drugs which are really have<br>been used for decades and decades called<br>Vin blasting and vincristine and so<br>these are really effective chemotherapy<br>agents they are on the who list of<br>essential medicines and the right the<br>way that these work is they work by<br>disrupting the cellular cytoskeleton in<br>particular these things called<br>microtubules inside cells and so they're<br>stained Green in the in the right hand<br>side there so what microtubules do is<br>all sorts of kind of mechanical work<br>around the cells so they might move<br>proteins and vesicles around they might<br>do things like draw chromosomes apart<br>when a cell is dividing<br>and so they're really integral<br>components to how a cell can function<br>but when you treat cells with things<br>like Vin blasting and vincristine what<br>might happen to microtubules is you get<br>a proliferation of these kind of curly<br>ends that you might be able to see we've<br>got a bigger picture in a second but<br>basically this most of the microtubule<br>is straight but at the ends it has curls<br>and a few treat with drugs these<br>particular drugs you basically get these<br>kind of curly things over proliferating<br>and you've disrupted your microtubules<br>one of the things one of the proteins<br>that it was known to be important for<br>the efficacy of or what how well these<br>alkaloid drugs work was this kinase<br>protein called met K1 and so this is a<br>kinase as I said kinase has put<br>phosphate onto other proteins and what<br>met K1 does is triggers this kinase<br>signaling Cascade so one kinase<br>activates another kinase which activates<br>another kinase and the downstream effect<br>of this is cell death which is what you<br>want in effect and when you're dealing<br>with a chemotherapy<br>but it wasn't really there was no logic<br>behind why met K1 was an essential<br>kinase for the efficacy of these vinca<br>alkaloid drugs so Mech K1 had a kinase<br>domain which is shown in the middle<br>there it's actually quite a large<br>protein though so it had these extra<br>domains which we didn't really know what<br>they did and so our approach was to look<br>at these other domains and try and<br>understand how they might be connected<br>to this microtubule disruption that<br>venka alkaloids carry out<br>and so a PhD student in the lab part of<br>our Philip trick came along and one of<br>the first things he did on his PhD was<br>to solve the structure of one of these<br>additional domains of met K1 and so<br>that's what's shown on the left here so<br>this is a domain that was of previously<br>unknown function no one really even<br>proposed that there was a domain there<br>he solved the structure which looks like<br>it does there it looks kind of like a<br>bunch of squiggles lined up next to us<br>but spaghetti lined up next to each<br>other so that didn't tell us its<br>function first up but one of the cool<br>things when you solve a protein<br>structure is you deposit it to this<br>place called the protein data bank and<br>so there's I think almost 200 000<br>protein structures that are deposited in<br>the protein data bank and so what pyro<br>could do is search his structure against<br>all of the other protein structures that<br>people had solved and what he found is<br>it's actually a really close match for<br>this Protein that's shown in pink here<br>and so that protein and pink happen to<br>be a protein that people had studied<br>really in quite some depth and it's<br>actually a protein that binds to<br>microtubules so it's a it's a tubulin<br>binding protein so tubulin is one of the<br>building blocks that makes up<br>microtubules so it looks like met K1<br>might have a direct domain that can<br>actually sense and bind to these<br>microtubules<br>a little a little bit more background<br>about tubulin before<br>um showing the next step is that to get<br>the straight part of tubulin versus the<br>the curly part of tubulin<br>um<br>tubulin has like a a straight and then a<br>more open form which this it's just kind<br>of opening and shutting in that little<br>movie there<br>um what these vincristine and Van<br>blasting do is they actually got to time<br>it right here they wedge in between<br>those two domains of tubulin and so they<br>stick it in that kind of more open form<br>and so that's why you end up getting<br>these kind of curly forms because the<br>those vinca alkaloids are getting<br>themselves stuck there and um that's and<br>it builds up these curls so it becomes a<br>pertinent question does this domain of<br>met K1 bind to the straight part of the<br>microtubule or the curved part of the<br>microtubule and it turns out that it<br>actually binds specifically to the bent<br>part of the microtubule which is induced<br>by these vinca alkaloid drugs<br>and so we now know that met K1 which<br>there was previously no reason for it to<br>well what no logic to why it was<br>activated by microtubule disruption<br>actually has a domain which gets it to<br>these curly tips of microtubules<br>what what we could then do is actually<br>look in some tumor sequencing databases<br>so patient tumors had been sequenced and<br>find that there's actually a couple of<br>hot spots of mutations in met K1 which<br>sit at that tubulin binding interface<br>and so previously before we had that<br>structure there's no reason we would<br>have understood why those mutations keep<br>on occurring in patients but it turns<br>out that these mutations so parvo tested<br>some of these actually disrupt its<br>ability to bind to tubulin<br>and so that was the end of parvel's PhD<br>but it's not necessarily the end of the<br>project<br>um so we have Alex Bowles in the lab<br>who's a PhD student really trying to<br>work out what happens after Met K1 gets<br>recruited to these curly ends of the<br>microtubules trying to understand this<br>uh like how the switching actually<br>happens at the moment we've got the<br>connection but we don't necessarily have<br>the switching and so that's what uh<br>where the story is going now<br>so the second example I want to talk to<br>you about is thinking about how when we<br>already know a gene and a protein is a<br>hot spot for getting knocked out in<br>cancers understanding its structure is<br>really important to understand like how<br>these mutations are knocking out<br>function<br>and so this um to understand this story<br>we need to have a little bit more<br>background about how DNA is packaged and<br>so some of you will be aware inside one<br>cell of your body you have about six<br>feet of DNA so it really needs to be a<br>packaged really effectively for it to be<br>able to fit inside the cell and inside<br>the nucleus and one of the ways that a<br>cell packages DNA effectively is by<br>wrapping it around these proteins called<br>histones and so this is kind of<br>analogous to wrapping cotton around a<br>cotton reel it keeps things tidy but<br>then these histones are packaged even<br>more efficiently into these kind of<br>superstructures called condensed<br>chromatin and one of the marks of<br>condensed chromatin is a single<br>ubiquitin molecule gets attached onto<br>the histone proteins<br>and so this is kind of a put you away<br>will keep you keep you away for later<br>when the genes need to be expressed<br>you'll have um the the DNA gets<br>unpackaged and this gives access to<br>proteins that turn on gene expression so<br>a single ubiquitin molecule is a marker<br>for um basically DNA structure<br>the protein complex<br>complexes that put on and off the<br>subicular mark then become really<br>important for controlling what genes are<br>going to be turned on and off at<br>different times and so the protein<br>complex that we've been studying in the<br>lab which takes off this ubiquitin Mark<br>is made of two main components one of<br>them is called back one and so Bap one<br>is a protease so it's a A protein that<br>can cleave other proteins and what it<br>does is it Cleaves this the c-terminus<br>of ubiquitin so it chops It Off from<br>histones<br>that's where the catalytic activity of<br>the complex comes from but it's<br>activated by this protein called an asxl<br>protein there's a few different asxl<br>proteins but it needs this partner to<br>activate it to be able to turn on its<br>activity so that's going to remove the<br>ubiquitin marks and promote more kind of<br>open chromatin structure where your<br>genes can be expressed more actively<br>now Bap one was known to be a really<br>important cancer Gene because of a<br>syndrome that certain families had which<br>made them more susceptible to<br>environmental carcinogens and so there's<br>germaline mutations in bap1 can<br>predispose to certain melanocytic tumors<br>and also to cancers such as malignant<br>mesothelioma and so mesothelioma is<br>generally a cancer which occurs when<br>you're exposed to asbestos but only at<br>really high levels if you've got kind of<br>normal bap1 or some other predisposition<br>genes but if you pick up a mutation in<br>bap1 then even kind of lower levels of<br>asbestos become more dangerous and so<br>understanding how it how these mutations<br>knock out function of back one might be<br>useful for being able to predict is this<br>person got a damage copy of that one<br>will there be more susceptible to<br>asbestos exposure or other carcinogens<br>so this structure was solved by first uh<br>she was a PhD student in the lab and<br>became a post-doctoral fellow in the lab<br>Mark tenure fogliso we're co-supervised<br>with Catherine day and so what Martina<br>was able to do was to solve a crystal<br>structure which showed us how the<br>protease component of this complex was<br>turned on by this asxl protein and so<br>the blue and yellow parts are the um the<br>protease part of the complex asxl has<br>this kind of bundle of helices here<br>which wrap around the C Terminus of the<br>bap1 protein and kind of hold this end<br>out of the way the um the end result of<br>this is a binding site for ubiquitin<br>which sits here it's it's basically a<br>binding site that's made up by the<br>yellow protease domain and this green<br>domain from asxl which there was no real<br>that doesn't have a catalytic function<br>of its own basically its function is to<br>hold back one of that confirmation and<br>through this it can recognize ubiquitin<br>really specifically and so this is<br>important because you don't want your<br>protease just chopping other proteins<br>non-specifically you want it to be able<br>to recognize ubiquitum and cleave it at<br>the right time<br>what we could then do is use the<br>structure to map where mutations that<br>are occurring in patients were showing<br>up and so what we can see so in this<br>representation on the right hand side<br>when we have basically when that worm<br>gets a bit fatter that means there's<br>more mutations shown up and there's a<br>gone red as well in this case<br>um<br>so mutations basically are clustered<br>around that ubiquitin binding site and<br>so this suggests that tumors that have<br>got these mutations in bap1 that affects<br>their binding site for ubiquitin so this<br>is disrupting The ubiquitin Binding site<br>they get a selective advantage and so<br>this is promoting their growth their<br>uncontrolled growth<br>and so tumors are selecting for the most<br>functionally important parts of this<br>bap1 molecule<br>and so that's how um the Bap one part of<br>the complex can be get knocked out but<br>there's also mutations that show up in<br>the asxl part of um the complex and so<br>where this project is going uh now<br>um a PhD student Cameron Reddington and<br>Abigail Burgess has been a researcher in<br>the lab for some time I really have been<br>digging down into how this complex is<br>targeted across the genome and so we've<br>understood how the catalytic activity<br>how that protection protease activity is<br>knocked out but which areas of the<br>genome that's directed to is going to<br>become really important because that's<br>going to turn on X gene expression in<br>different areas of the genome and so one<br>of the areas of Interest here is that if<br>you mutate the asxl component of the<br>complex that drives leukemias in general<br>whereas if you have mutations in the Bap<br>one part of the complex that drives<br>things like mesothea<br>melanocytic tumors and so the targeting<br>of this complex seems to be leading to<br>different types of cancers depending on<br>how these mutations are arising and so<br>that's what Cameron and Abby have been<br>doing working out how the other domains<br>of asxl proteins direct this complex<br>kind of guide it around different parts<br>of the genome<br>so that's really been about<br>understanding how things get broken<br>the last part of the last example that I<br>want to talk to you about is really<br>trying to understand can we target a<br>particular protein would it be a good<br>thing to spend all that effort into<br>making a drug that fits a particular um<br>active site to block its function<br>and so this story is dealing with<br>proteins called the Tribbles proteins<br>and so there's three triples proteins in<br>humans but the way that triples proteins<br>were discovered were back in the early<br>2000s in drosophila so people who study<br>fly genetics what they did is created<br>mutations in the Tribbles protein and<br>what or the triple Gene and what that<br>did was drove kind of the uncontrolled<br>proliferation of these Brown cells at<br>the bottom of a drosophila oocyte and so<br>of course they were fly geneticists so<br>they're probably Star Trek fans<br>um and if you're a Star Trek fan which I<br>am not but I've learned about through<br>working on triples proteins<br>um triples proteins Tribbles have quite<br>a cult following in the Star Trek world<br>and so what they are is these kind of<br>fluffy things that are in this case<br>taking over the Starship Enterprise they<br>grow out of control<br>um and so they you've got to admit they<br>do look something like um the triple the<br>cells that when they're stained like<br>that and so they named this Gene<br>Tribbles and so it's got such cult<br>following you can buy all sorts of you<br>can buy Triple slippers and triples beer<br>and all sorts of things if you dig deep<br>enough on eBay<br>um but that's not the reason that we got<br>interested in triples<br>um triple's proteins are part of this<br>really interesting family of proteins<br>called pseudokinases and so I've already<br>talked to you about how kinases are the<br>proteins that put phosphate onto other<br>proteins<br>but what troubles what pseudokinosis are<br>they are things that look like kinases<br>so they have the same shape as a kinase<br>but they don't transfer phosphate so<br>they've lost specific residues and their<br>active sites that enables them to be<br>able to transfer the do the actual kind<br>of chemical reaction to transfer the<br>phosphate so they they look like one<br>thing but they're not quite that thing<br>much like these dogs on the right hand<br>side so this is a really interesting<br>area of biology it's also a really great<br>community of researchers so James is not<br>looking quite as warm as he is in San<br>Diego down there but there's really a<br>good community of researchers looking at<br>these pseudokinases trying to understand<br>their functions because they basically<br>pervade lots of interesting areas of<br>biology<br>and so<br>what Tribbles actually do is they bind<br>to another protein called cop1<br>and so what cop1 does is it transfers<br>ubiquitin onto other proteins<br>and so<br>I've said my lab is kind of interested<br>in these post-translational<br>modifications which is transverse<br>phosphate and transfer of ubiquitin and<br>this is a thing that looks like<br>something that transfer phosphate but it<br>actually helps transfer ubiquitin so<br>this is like the perfect project for us<br>but what Tribbles do is they they bind<br>to substrate proteins which are shown in<br>green here what those substrates<br>generally are are transcription factors<br>which control gene expression and so if<br>they degra sorry if they put these<br>chains of ubiquitin onto transcription<br>factors well this is a signal for in the<br>cell is that we've completely got to<br>degrade that protein we've got to get<br>rid of it completely and so this is a<br>really effective way of turning off gene<br>expression<br>and it just so nicely happens actually<br>protein degradation is one of kind of<br>the most exciting areas of drug<br>development at the moment because you<br>can think that instead of just trying to<br>block a protein from doing its function<br>if we could degrade it completely that<br>gets rid of it out of the cell and<br>you've got rid of your kind of<br>cancer-driving protein uh completely so<br>it's it's really kind of a hot area of<br>biology but it's also got really lots of<br>kind of fundamental interests as well<br>now in terms of the genes that actually<br>Tribbles actually regulate expression of<br>these genes are really highly involved<br>in myeloid cell development and proper<br>differentiation of myeloid cells and so<br>when you have too much of the triples<br>proteins what this can actually do is<br>cause too much degradation of those<br>transcription factors and that can drive<br>acute myeloidal leukemia and so this is<br>an example from our collaborator Karen<br>kishan who's now in Glasgow basically if<br>you transplant bone marrow over<br>expressing Trip 2 and to mice all of<br>them basically get acute myelody<br>leukemia and so<br>going in the logic was there that if we<br>could block this function that would be<br>a good thing because too much triples is<br>a bad thing<br>um but we have this thing that looks<br>something like a kinase but we don't<br>know if the active side of that protein<br>has anything to do with its functions so<br>would making a drug against these<br>proteins even do anything<br>um useful if it Bound in that active<br>site<br>so we've been working on triples<br>proteins for quite some time in the lab<br>it's probably a long one of our longest<br>running projects and a lot of that work<br>has been led by Sam Jamison who's a<br>researcher in the lab and I'm just going<br>to summarize like seven years of Sam's<br>work in one slide here<br>but basically what we've we've solved a<br>bunch of different structures of triples<br>proteins one of the things we've<br>discovered is that it has this form<br>where it holds on to its tail and this<br>tail is basically the part of the<br>protein that goes off and binds to the<br>Uric when the ligo is called cop1 and so<br>it's got an off form and an on form and<br>so what I'm going to do is morph between<br>those two structures to show what's<br>going on<br>and so we've also discovered how a<br>substrate binds to trip one and so when<br>the substrate comes along this actually<br>causes allosteric changes through the<br>cut the pseudokinase domain and this<br>actually pushes the c-terminal tail away<br>from the pseudokinase domain so<br>basically the substrate binding and the<br>letting the tail go to go and find the<br>cop1 those are coordinated it's a<br>coordinated event but if we just focus<br>our attention kind of on that middle<br>part of the triples protein there what<br>you might notice is when the substrate's<br>on there pause it<br>there's changes going on in that active<br>site which if we could stabilize one of<br>the structures or the other this might<br>mean that we can actually block function<br>of substrate binding so I'll just show<br>that again so you look there's residues<br>that are changing in there if we could<br>stabilize that activation Loop in one<br>conformation or the other we should be<br>able to block substrate from binding so<br>we can block treble's function and so<br>this is just shown next to the kinase I<br>showed you earlier where a kinase drug<br>sits in the active site so this is<br>really proof of principle that if we can<br>make drugs that sit in this active site<br>even though this is not a active kinase<br>it's a pseudokinase we should be able to<br>block its function because it's looking<br>like it's working in the same way<br>so that comes to the end of my three<br>examples hopefully I've Illustrated why<br>solving structures is useful on various<br>different levels so linking kind of un<br>like linking mechanism of knowing drugs<br>understanding how protein structure gets<br>disrupted and also understanding whether<br>things might make good drag targets just<br>on the final slide what I want to<br>illustrate is where we're going in the<br>future so as I've already shown you with<br>that kind of movie proteins they are<br>really we show them often as static<br>things but really they're moving around<br>and so trapping them in particular<br>confirmations is really useful for<br>understanding protein function and so<br>what we've been doing is starting to try<br>and make these things in pink here<br>called protein nanobodies and so these<br>are useful for solving trapping<br>structures of proteins both to<br>manipulate how they behave and also<br>potentially to solve structures and so<br>this is a really nice image that's<br>um just came out earlier in the month<br>and made by Ben in our department of<br>Tribbles this is the trip 2 structure<br>trapped by a nanobodie<br>um and it's being kind of taken over by<br>nanobodies uh sorry by Tribbles my<br>brain's been taken over by nobody's<br>um<br>but the other thing that's really useful<br>for trapping these flexible proteins is<br>this an alternative technique for<br>solving structures that doesn't require<br>a crystal and so I said we spend a lot<br>of time making protein and trying to<br>grow crystals we still need to spend a<br>lot of time making protein but if we<br>have the right type of protein that's<br>large enough we can use this process<br>called electron cryo-electron microscopy<br>to solve structures directly of proteins<br>and this is really basically just<br>exploded in the last few years in terms<br>of the techniques and the technology<br>that enable this have really changed the<br>game and how we are able to solve<br>structures so it's really an area we've<br>been leaning heavily on our Australian<br>collaborators to be able to do this at<br>the moment it's kind of a little bit of<br>hard work at the moment doing it from<br>afar but we're doing our best to kind of<br>move with the times in there so we're<br>kind of moving to basically using any<br>method that we can to solve protein<br>structures to inform protein function<br>so that just brings me to thank all the<br>people the lots and lots of people who<br>have contributed to this work firstly<br>they're not listed up here but my family<br>for all the support over the years and<br>being very tolerant of when I'm not<br>there either physically or mental or<br>mentally<br>um yeah the support's really appreciated<br>and then to my group first up in in my<br>group Sam and Abby really are the ones<br>who keep the wheels turning in the lab<br>they keep everyone else in line they<br>drive their own research projects but<br>they also make sure everything runs<br>really well make coming to work just fun<br>and this is a list I think of most of<br>the students I might have missed a<br>couple of names there but we've had a<br>really great crop of honors and PhD<br>students I've named kind of some<br>specific ones along the way related to<br>specific projects but really all the<br>students through the lab have been great<br>we've got great internal collaborations<br>with Liz Ledgerwood Catherine day and<br>Anita dunbeer on various different<br>projects some have talked about today<br>some I've not had time to talk about<br>um<br>we also collaborate within New Zealand<br>with Ren Dobson at Canterbury we've got<br>a great slew of international<br>collaborators James from the we high<br>it's great to be able to have you here<br>today and we also work with David<br>Croucher on the Met K-1 work at the<br>Garvin Institute from Sydney and then a<br>bunch of people from both the UK and the<br>US who have been really pivotal and<br>being able to get a lot of this work<br>done of course none of this work gets<br>done without funding we've had fantastic<br>support from starting off with my<br>Rutherford Discovery Fellowship had<br>great support from the Marsden fund and<br>the HRC in terms of actual projects<br>lotteries health and Yorks have been<br>great for getting projects done and<br>equipment and purchased and as I said<br>the New Zealand synchrotron group has<br>been great for being able to get to<br>Australia to use the sync Patron and<br>with that I'd just like to thank you all<br>foreign<br>Peter and thank you so much that was a<br>tour de force and um<br>actually I'm just identifying that uh<br>you have fun in your work and your<br>leisure time and that picture from the<br>escape room at the prison uh it probably<br>sums up the the kind of the kind of<br>attitude that you have to have to work<br>in this area that it's uh that it's hard<br>work and uh you know escaping from<br>colditz at times I'm sure would be an<br>easier task than unlocking some of these<br>protein structures<br>um look I'm not going to try as a humble<br>physicist to even uh try and walk us<br>through that but I will give some<br>remarks the first thing is it was very<br>clear and evident right from the start<br>your happy smile and your body language<br>how much you enjoy what you do and how<br>much you enjoy communicating and<br>disseminating that how much you enjoy<br>the challenge of structure linking<br>structure to function understanding how<br>that fits into the beautiful complex<br>almost un non-understandable nature of<br>the way that biology works and you gave<br>us is an example of the tour de force of<br>that I was very pleased that you<br>introduced for me as someone who's<br>taught in electrical engineering a<br>beautiful simple circuit the BC 547 and<br>a single a single transistor switching<br>circuit I thought I could follow but at<br>that point uh then this idea that we can<br>that we can somehow think of Simplicity<br>and switching but the complexity of real<br>life is is<br>um often beyond our comprehension unless<br>we start to do the things that you<br>showed that we can do so carefully look<br>at individual pieces and puzzles and try<br>and build up things together<br>your ability to communicate is very<br>clear the visualization and the and the<br>cartoons that you produce help to guide<br>us through that journey and and you very<br>much then lead us to three questions<br>that<br>um not only identify<br>um<br>issues that if we were in a<br>pharmaceutical company would stop at<br>that first question why is a switch<br>triggered and would go to ongoing with<br>research to look at individual things<br>and turn the handle on on solving<br>structures and trying to identify<br>molecules that might go through a a long<br>and increasing list of of targets that<br>we're after but you demonstrated that at<br>a university we need to go beyond that<br>and look at the the bigger picture still<br>looking at the fundamental knowledge of<br>of why things work uh how can how can<br>these switches be triggered at a<br>fundamental level what are the model<br>systems that can link in in your case<br>through those triple proteins to the<br>things that we know well and you can<br>identify the things that we can work on<br>that by joining with collaborative teams<br>around the world we can hope to see<br>advances that will lead to<br>understanding for the betterment of<br>treatments and um<br>and performance of modern medicine so I<br>believe that you will all join with me<br>and agree that Peter passed the test<br>that what we saw was something that met<br>the criteria of outstanding performance<br>of someone who is still at an early<br>stage in his career that has generated<br>knowledge that in the rest of your<br>career both yourself and through the uh<br>the researchers that you will train and<br>Inspire will go on and to make a real<br>impact on the world we look forward to<br>seeing that impact be made but I would<br>like to ask you to join me in thanking<br>Peter for just such a wonderful lecture<br>before I invite the vice Chancellor to<br>give you Awards so thank you very much<br>Peter<br>so now we have a table over here that<br>has some things<br>um so um I'll invite the vice Chancellor<br>Professor David Murdock to come and<br>present the award you're welcome to say<br>some remarks<br>has summed it up very well so so please<br>um uh please come and receive the Carl<br>and um there is wrapped a book that you<br>may wish to uh after the lecture unwrap<br>and show people what Carl Smith wrote uh<br>that that is New Zealand from A to Z<br>and a third token of our appreciation uh<br>I did understand that someone had uh put<br>up a poster of your talk on their<br>bedroom door but here's one that's<br>framed that can go at a very special<br>place in your home<br>with that I thank you all for attending<br>um there may be some official<br>photographs being taken so please uh<br>thank you for coming and enjoy the rest</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
