children's literature<br>is that is that them all it's in some<br>Francis Hodgkin's fellow<br>silhouette song Satya<br>Carolyn Plummer fellow in Community<br>Dance Michael Parmenter welcome thank<br>you<br>the University of otago fellowships had<br>been in existence for over 50 years some<br>of them<br>and are a huge Testament to the<br>University's commitment to the creative<br>process<br>and I'd like to quote to you uh from a<br>passage that Charles Brash wrote in 1959<br>which actually also<br>prefaces the front page of the<br>University fellows website<br>Charles Brash wrote part of the<br>University's proper business is to act<br>as a nurse to the Arts<br>more exactly<br>to the imagination as it expresses<br>itself in the Arts and Sciences<br>imagination can flourish anywhere<br>but it should flourish as a matter of<br>course in a university for which is only<br>through imaginative thinking that<br>Society grows materially and<br>intellectually<br>into quota<br>though the University of otago believes<br>that our writer's artist composers<br>musicians and dancers have a vital role<br>to play in the health and well-being of<br>our community not just the university<br>community or the Dunedin Community but<br>the wider community of New Zealand<br>we look to them to offer us Visions we<br>cannot make ourselves we rely on their<br>craft to generate experiences which will<br>challenge us entertain us<br>provoke and reassure us<br>no pressure<br>end of quote<br>so this forum today is to uh<br>is is an opportunity for us to hear<br>about the fellows and their Journeys as<br>creative artists<br>um and to learn how these wonderful<br>people do their craft it's um it's not a<br>show and tell it's just a discussion<br>about the process that they um that they<br>use to to do what they do do so as I say<br>if you can't hear me do just shout and<br>we'll all Speak Up and Slow Down<br>and um we will have time uh for<br>questions and answers<br>um presently<br>so to start with I just like to throw<br>one question well I'd like to ask each<br>of the fellows to tell us briefly about<br>their career path their career to date<br>and their Journey<br>is an artist<br>so<br>just a general<br>CV<br>go who started on my end are you oh well<br>I just looked at you sorry Michael do<br>um well my background is in contemporary<br>dance<br>I began dancing here in Dunedin with the<br>initial Shona Dunlop McTavish she was my<br>very first teacher so coming back here<br>has been like a return to<br>origins in a certain sense<br>um but to be very brief I was a<br>contemporary dance choreographer I had<br>my own company for a couple of decades<br>uh of recent period I sort of turned to<br>academic work<br>uh doing a masters and working towards a<br>doctorate in philosophy and dance<br>but coinciding with the period where I<br>was doing some doctoral research in<br>Paris I started to explore French<br>Regional dancers I I was attracted<br>originally by the music because I'm<br>always looking for music for my<br>contemporary dance classes and I came<br>across this music from the occitane<br>region of France the sort of central and<br>southern area and it was just Exquisite<br>dance music it just got me going and my<br>students loved it so when I was in<br>France it suddenly occurred to me that<br>of course this is dance music what sort<br>of dances do people do to this music so<br>I I did some a bit of research and went<br>to a few festivals and discovered a<br>movement called balfolk which is a a<br>Revival of traditional European group<br>dancers partner dancers and<br>um that has sort of shifted my focus<br>into well I won't say shifter because I<br>was already a Tango dancer for 20 years<br>so I was involved in the social dance of<br>one sort or another<br>but I I became very fascinated by the<br>potential of this form of dance called<br>Balfour to<br>be a negotiating place for different<br>dance styles so I think that's probably<br>enough because I could go on but um<br>hey thanks for being here on a Saturday<br>cloudy Saturday<br>um so yeah my name is sarawit and<br>um I was born in Thailand but spend most<br>of my years in growing up in Auckland<br>um<br>and I guess I didn't really have a<br>career goals or what I would like to<br>become I mean art was one of the only<br>things that I I've always been good at<br>um so I actually did four years<br>undergrad degrees in paintings and that<br>was in Auckland and I found that<br>paintings become quite restricted<br>because you're constantly dealing with a<br>flat surface<br>so for my Master's master degree I shift<br>away from paintings and spent two years<br>um developing<br>um<br>skills to do with moving image<br>um<br>and now currently<br>um I usually present my work in a kind<br>of video installation<br>um combining both moving image and<br>sculptural elements some of the works<br>that I'm working exploring right now<br>during the fellowship is that I'm<br>combining<br>um<br>hand carving of omaru limestones<br>with a new body of filmic work focusing<br>on the cortical which is the white Heron<br>nesting site out on the west coast of<br>yeah<br>swap now<br>um Kiara hello everyone and I guess my<br>journey started when I was a kid and<br>my writing Journey basically started<br>with books it was a reading Journey<br>really<br>um I always found books to be an escape<br>and my mum used to use the public<br>library as a babysitter which is<br>probably a form of neglect now I think<br>about it but um it was great for me<br>um and so my natural progression from<br>Reading was to write and I used to<br>submit articles to school newspaper and<br>then sort of lost my confidence in<br>writing in my 20s and then when I found<br>out I was pregnant I decided to make a<br>book for my son and I was working at an<br>art studio at the time and one of the<br>artists there had just signed a book<br>Deal saw the book I was working on<br>during lunch times and said I should<br>send it to her agent which I did and<br>then her agent said this is trash<br>um so but it's sort of I don't know<br>maybe I just don't like being said told<br>no<br>um it just sort of sparked something in<br>me to carry on writing so I kept doing<br>that for a couple of years sending out<br>work getting rejected and then<br>eventually one<br>um the greenhouse funny prize which was<br>run by a literary agency and had favor<br>of Faber on the judging panel and they<br>bought my first book in 2014 and since<br>then it's just been a bit of a whirlwind<br>it's just been I've been really lucky I<br>moved here a few years ago and luckily<br>my Publishers didn't drop me so it can<br>be a Fickle business I appreciate when<br>there's some loyalty shown in this<br>business and I like to tell people that<br>I have more books published now than I<br>have fingers and toes<br>um but that doesn't mean I'm missing<br>like five terms I had like 20 more than<br>20 books out<br>um and so yes so the<br>um residency here has been an extension<br>of that and have given me some time to<br>write a book that I've kind of had in<br>the back of my mind for a while but<br>never been able to dive into because of<br>contracts that are books that are due<br>um to Publishers so this gave me a<br>chance to work on that passion project<br>which was brilliant and hopefully we<br>could talk about later yeah<br>lovely<br>Sean are you okay well so um my where<br>what was the original question<br>your career basically my career I guess<br>my career started as a sort of a<br>uh listener to music I feel like I still<br>like it feel like I'm more of a listener<br>in some ways than a composer I'm uh you<br>know I'm a maker of a musical accident<br>and um capitalizing on those is what I<br>enjoy and tend to do best but probably<br>started making<br>my music career although I'd been<br>messing around with music since I was a<br>teenager probably didn't start until my<br>early 30s which is kind of late for this<br>so and<br>um what I make is a form of pop music I<br>suppose that sort of<br>um<br>a weird cross between songwriting and<br>electronic music and<br>their Tunes in there there are lyrics<br>and there are weird other things<br>um so uh<br>basically I sort of I've evolved from<br>making music in my bedroom to coming out<br>and making albums of music with people<br>and<br>um I think it's it's pop music but it's<br>a little bit on the brainy side at times<br>so it doesn't trouble the upper reaches<br>of the charts in New Zealand anyway but<br>um I'm still on the same I feel like I'm<br>on the same Journey I'm still about<br>making weird little pop songs it's a<br>thing that interests me most and and<br>and being being a sort of a<br>being a dilettante<br>is my weakness and I think also kind of<br>my strength too because<br>um because<br>you know I I can always hear a little<br>thing and try and incorporate into what<br>I do and and it's about play really so<br>don't make any sense yes<br>leading on from that I'd like to ask you<br>about the the creative process and um<br>uh how you work now where's your<br>inspiration what's your methodology to<br>make something<br>yeah um well I mean for me<br>um<br>I think my the best thing for me when<br>I'm making music and I've you know I've<br>probably been<br>um doing it in the public Sphere for I<br>mean um<br>more you know more than 20 years now is<br>um is the more unconscious I can be<br>about the process the better really the<br>more I can be in beginner's mind the<br>more I can be in a situation where I'm<br>excited about something<br>uh or inspired even if I really don't<br>know what I'm doing in fact that lack of<br>knowledge is a real is a real burn<br>because<br>you know it's the I think the<br>unconscious producers again it's it's<br>that thing uh interesting Excellence<br>um interesting mistakes<br>and um part of my role as an artist is<br>to be a listener to those things<br>and uh to be able to capitalize them on<br>them and um extend those ideas as much<br>as possible so<br>any I'm always seeking inspiration<br>um it doesn't have to be music it can be<br>a song like a snatch of a song that I<br>hear or something that takes me back it<br>can be a painting it can be a film it<br>can be a conversation it can be a place<br>um I find myself in situations where I'm<br>suddenly inspired I don't have to rush<br>back home to try and noodle something<br>out you know to turn it into something<br>um turn into a song so yeah it's it's<br>it's capitalizing on moments of<br>um<br>being inspired by any given situation or<br>any given work of art and not<br>necessarily knowing what I'm doing<br>that's the best thing for me yeah I<br>think I'm quite similar to Sean in that<br>um I can guarantee I'll have a brilliant<br>idea when I'm supposed to be writing<br>something entirely different and there's<br>a deadline looming and then I get really<br>distracted but I feel like my best work<br>comes when I have that energy to go for<br>it so I try I try to you know see that<br>through before all returning to<br>whatever's on on the desk<br>um<br>but yeah I've been asked this before I<br>wish I could sit here and say you know I<br>get up every day and I sit down from so<br>and so hour to so and so hour and I do<br>this many words but I very much have to<br>have a lot of thinking time so I think<br>people don't think I'm doing much<br>um when I'm napping I'm thinking<br>um<br>but then what happens is a lot of<br>percolation happens in my brain and then<br>I'll sit down and I'll just write and<br>the whole thing will come out quite<br>quickly and<br>um yeah that's sort of my process it's<br>not a great process to have when you've<br>got a few things is it yeah I think it<br>does I think it's the only process the<br>only phrases okay so it's a good process<br>only sometimes these moments hit me at<br>midnight and there's not a great time to<br>have to get out of bed and go and write<br>but um yeah that's pretty much it I<br>don't have a set routine so to speak and<br>do you have a little notebook that you<br>write ideas down then I have many you<br>know I have a notebook I have scraps of<br>paper I have my phone<br>um and then trying to piece them all<br>together and remember where things were<br>quite<br>um tricky<br>so anyway what's your what's your um<br>process creative process do you have a<br>routine or does it just happen or I mean<br>the the Romantic sort of idea ever of<br>the empty canvas process where do you<br>start or where does it come from<br>uh well I haven't deal with an empty<br>canvas for a long time<br>um<br>I think because uh I'm a multimedia I<br>have a multimedia practice so a lot of<br>the time I deal with a range of<br>different mediums<br>um and sometimes ideas come out from<br>dealing with the process of tackling how<br>to deal with that material for example<br>you know I would be like sanding<br>um Limestone and like the texture of the<br>Limestone itself would kind of inform<br>you know other ideas<br>it could be something to do with<br>graininess<br>um<br>the concept of time<br>um you know it's such an ancient<br>material<br>and sometimes I draw back to you know my<br>own cultural<br>influences as well like I there's a rich<br>history of craft practices and different<br>art forms back in Thailand but also<br>that's culturally Rich here also like um<br>you know trying to understand<br>to go back to Limestone again like to<br>understand the complexity of place<br>and the geopolitics that have to do with<br>like where landstones are from and<br>connections that people have to places<br>um yeah so a lot of the time process<br>methodology and ideas going back and<br>forth between these two countries and<br>that I'm related to so yeah informed by<br>Thailand and both both Thailand and yeah<br>yeah<br>my process for the fellowship is very<br>different from what I normally do as a<br>as a choreographer because as a<br>choreographer I uh most of the time play<br>uh movement is the the material so I uh<br>what often inaugurates my thinking is<br>being in the studio moving<br>um leecher said something once he said<br>never trust an idea you had while<br>sitting down<br>so I figured if I had ideas while I was<br>dancing I was going for the better<br>quality ideas<br>and that's basically what I do most of<br>the time is I'm thinking about things<br>and I'm dancing and those two things uh<br>rub up against each other to produce<br>movement ideas<br>but the fellowship is very different<br>from that process here here except that<br>this morning as I was thinking about the<br>session I was in an air Cafe just sort<br>of jotting down a few things and I had<br>an epiphany and I realized what my<br>fellowship's all about finally finally<br>now that I'm in the last month yeah<br>because<br>I came here with this idea that I was<br>going to introduce bowel folk which is a<br>sort of a a European<br>Revival of traditional dancers but I<br>came into a community that is just full<br>of dance that's already there I wasn't<br>bringing anything new<br>um and<br>there was so much for me to explore I<br>just made a little note of this some of<br>the stuff I've been doing since I've<br>been here so I've been to a couple of<br>Scottish kaylies I've been learning<br>Irish dance uh flat-footing chonos dance<br>I've been having regular salsa and<br>bachata classes I've been dancing Tango<br>for 20 years I'm now my wristband I'm at<br>a blues and swing Festival this weekend<br>I go to the American contradicts classes<br>I have privates in Brazilian for Hall I<br>went to a dance in amru a few weeks ago<br>which was sequence dance choreographed<br>Ballroom I went to the larnic ball a<br>friend of mine here we're doing<br>Explorations in Swedish Polska I've been<br>doing Regency dance performing at<br>overston in the Jane Austen piece and<br>then off to the Regency ball in omaru so<br>I realized that what I'm doing is I'm<br>playing with dance forms here in an<br>attempt to solve a problem that<br>confronted me or confront me all the<br>time when I'm teaching and that is as a<br>community we've lost<br>the use of dance as what unites the<br>community so in the past and until the<br>early 20th century there were<br>communities that danced<br>communities that use dance as a way of<br>uniting them to identifying<br>self-identifying but now we live in<br>something completely different which is<br>we live in dance communities I'm at the<br>this weekend I'm with the swing people<br>it's got nothing to do with Dunedin or<br>the it's all the swing people from New<br>Zealand who've come and some from<br>overseas have come together there's a<br>Tango Community it's not the Tango<br>community in Dunedin it's all the people<br>in New Zealand who study Tango so all<br>these dance forms have become isolated<br>and quite separate I was talking to a<br>guy I was doing a a saucer class with on<br>Friday he had no idea that there was a<br>swing and Blues Festival on this weekend<br>in fact you didn't even know that there<br>was such a thing as blues dance<br>so all these communities have become<br>little little worlds unto themselves and<br>often some of these groups have<br>arguments between themselves and divide<br>into further little groups<br>so we live in a time now where dance is<br>not<br>expressing a United Community it's<br>isolating us into many communities<br>so that was sort of the problem that I<br>confronted uh when I thought of applying<br>for<br>the fellowship because For Me dances<br>away about it's a method for Imagining<br>the sort of communities we might like to<br>be not necessarily describing who we are<br>but playing do us doing a sketch pad for<br>the sort of societies we might like to<br>be so I realized this morning that what<br>I was playing with was all these<br>different dance forms<br>to see how we might be able to<br>get people to interact and share things<br>in these dance forms<br>um that doesn't seem to be happening<br>very much at the moment I could say a<br>whole lot more about that but what I do<br>what I'm shifted from is playing dancing<br>with my own body to now dancing<br>or playing with lots of different dance<br>forms and the people who dance them<br>it's beautiful<br>um Arts blues dancing<br>come along the weekend<br>it is a very old dance form it goes back<br>to the turn of the 19th and 20th Century<br>it's we think of the Blues as the solo<br>guy with the the cranky guitar<br>expressing his soul and that sort of<br>thing but most of the the most popular<br>blues artists at the time were people<br>like Bessie Smith who toured with dance<br>orchestras Blues was dance music it was<br>what people dance to which then became<br>Charleston and swing and so it's the<br>predecessor of all these um later Jazz<br>based forms it's the proto-jazz dance<br>thank you<br>I'd like to ask you all now um<br>uh question regarding<br>um your work and who you're actually<br>doing it for<br>for yourself for your public for your<br>audience<br>and does that actually affect your<br>go<br>are you doing are you mindful of the end<br>product or is the end product just a<br>um<br>for me it's<br>what's the word paradoxical I suppose I<br>mean it's both at the same time really I<br>mean it's it doesn't turn out very well<br>if I'm not really doing it for me and<br>following exactly what I want to do and<br>um my craziest notion<br>um it's that you know the little still<br>Small Voice that's the little voice<br>you've got to listen to that little<br>thing what about that little thing that<br>you don't see very often try that and<br>it's it's you know it has to tell me a<br>few times before that<br>I get the point<br>um but I think that I'm I'm always<br>trying to please myself with what I do<br>but I'm always feeling like I'm part of<br>a conversation I don't know who's really<br>listening at the other end and hopefully<br>somebody is listening and even better if<br>they're talking back in some sort of way<br>if I was really just doing it entirely<br>for myself<br>um it would be I don't know it would<br>have become weird and entirely<br>unlistenable not by now probably but you<br>always I think<br>this is my idea<br>um<br>this is the thing I want to try this is<br>the thing I'm excited about<br>and there is probably I'm going to say<br>there's an element of compromise and<br>where you're kind of going now how do I<br>get that across how do I get that how do<br>I sand away whatever rough edges are<br>necessary to be sanded away or or<br>modulate what I'm doing to the point<br>where<br>now<br>that crazy little idea I had is<br>something that other people can get and<br>enjoy so<br>both at the same time<br>yeah I think it's quite similar for me I<br>am<br>I and also<br>said career I think when I first started<br>I was<br>um writing<br>for myself<br>um and then what helped was that I have<br>the same sense of humor as an<br>eight-year-old so there was a market for<br>what I was producing but I think some<br>things became more apparent as I<br>was continue to write that I have a<br>platform now and I think as a brown<br>author it became more important to me to<br>make sure my books reflected a more<br>diverse Society<br>um but particularly when I was growing<br>up there weren't any books with<br>characters of color in in there and I<br>think in some ways that if kids read<br>stories that are not reflective of their<br>world they start to think that their<br>stories are not important or that<br>they're invisible and so I I consciously<br>make a decision now about who my<br>characters are and making sure that I<br>have a really diverse<br>cast of characters but I think it's<br>equally important that when a kid goes<br>into a Bookshop and they see my ethnic<br>name on the cover that it's not sort of<br>type cast<br>stereotypical Brown issue books that<br>they see my name on the cover of book<br>with a panda on it means that they get<br>sort of a permission to write whatever<br>stories they want to write you know<br>whether they're about brown people or<br>whether they're about pigeons so<br>um yeah I think more consciously now but<br>I think at the heart of it I'm still<br>writing for myself because the minute<br>you put the expectations of your readers<br>on you it can be quite stifling to<br>creativity so<br>um yeah that's kind of where I'm coming<br>from<br>yeah so are you working for yourself are<br>you creating for yourself or are you<br>more are you eagerly aware of of uh end<br>viewer<br>no I usually just like lock myself in<br>the Stylo no<br>um I completely agree with both Sean and<br>swap now it's a bit of both<br>um<br>even though sometimes you know you<br>completely Focus<br>and probably spent a week just with you<br>like without with your own work inside<br>your studio it's still<br>you're still informed by you know<br>conversation with friends<br>um<br>I mean I don't think of audience a lot<br>but I mean<br>I don't think it's possible to make work<br>just for yourself because you live in<br>society and like whether you're aware of<br>it or not<br>um external ideas filter through you um<br>and<br>yeah but I yeah I<br>kind of reflect on what swapna just said<br>as well<br>um<br>I kind of will make work for myself in<br>the sense that when I started off I<br>didn't really have a lot of<br>examples of visual artists who you know<br>share similar background as me<br>especially within um New Zealand art<br>history Canon<br>so it was a bit of a challenge of like<br>okay what kind of<br>message or context do I fit in or would<br>do I share with the public or who would<br>be able to relate it to<br>you know my history or my experience<br>um<br>and yeah I think<br>of the audience in terms of yeah both um<br>pakeha and Maori but also<br>I guess more and more now recently I get<br>asked by younger artists who probably<br>have<br>um<br>also have kind of you know coming from<br>um migrant background or grow up as a<br>Asian New Zealand<br>um<br>history and Heritage you know um so yeah<br>I do kind of think of them in mind but<br>when you exhibit your work your work is<br>free from you so<br>and I like it that way because I I like<br>that kind of generosity that art gives<br>to audience or the public so that they<br>can bring their own<br>um interpretation to it<br>so Michael<br>um as a choreographer I probably would<br>have originally said I may work for<br>myself you know if I don't love it I<br>love doing it it's not worth doing<br>because I'm the one that's doing it<br>often but now the question sorry doesn't<br>make any sense at all because I'm not<br>making anything for myself but to we are<br>the people that I'm dancing with and the<br>communities I've danced with uh we are<br>making dance for ourselves for a<br>community that we will<br>we that we live in so the idea of me<br>making I'm not making something what<br>it's I'm part of a group that is we're<br>creating things together I'm just sort<br>of a<br>facilitator yeah yeah and I'm going away<br>and and I'm hoping all the stuff's going<br>to keep on going<br>um so I've got nothing to do with it<br>well it's been a shift for me but but I<br>think the<br>uh Carolyn Plummer Fellowship in<br>community dance is always is always kind<br>of an odd one out from that idea of the<br>individual creator<br>wow<br>good<br>um<br>the last two years has been quite<br>challenging for all<br>how has Co lockdown and covert affected<br>you each in your practice in your career<br>or your inspiration<br>well I'll start this time<br>Sean's been he's been starting out so um<br>but Sean always forgets the question<br>I'll say it again<br>I found that somebody reminds me when it<br>gets to yeah yeah<br>so so covered and dance<br>thrive on exactly the same thing<br>intimacy<br>and so<br>what is celebrated in dance is<br>problematic in covert<br>so so dance and covert to somehow even<br>though they share intimacy they now<br>don't work together because we've had to<br>avoid contact and I'm not just talking<br>about physical contact but when you're<br>dancing with someone in a room you are<br>with them you're in their presence and<br>covert loves presence<br>um<br>and so I would suggest that<br>dance has been drastically<br>affected by covert<br>um and we are only now looking you know<br>enjoying the period of being able to<br>dance together<br>um without fear of dire consequences<br>um but every cloud has a silver lining<br>for me personally uh when we went into<br>lockdown<br>I I Can't Stop Dancing I have to be<br>dancing so I did a little project where<br>I found a dance mom that's always<br>fascinated fascinated me that is<br>appellation flat footing a sort of<br>predecessor of tap and I got an old<br>table and took off the legs and put it<br>down in my living room and so I had<br>months and months of uh personal time<br>where I didn't have to do anything but<br>you know stay at home and started<br>exploring this dance form so yes covert<br>is drastically affected uh darts<br>and what I'm doing in the trying to do<br>in the fellowship at the moment isn't so<br>perfectly timed now because we need to<br>we need to contact again so if there's<br>any therapy that's needed for coming out<br>of uh the covert era it's getting<br>together and dancing because it's been<br>uh<br>it's been neglected<br>yeah I would say on a personal level<br>um it didn't affect much my practice<br>um<br>in a sense that parts of my practice<br>dealing with digital animation as well<br>so I developed a digital body of work<br>where you know I could comfortably sit<br>in front of computer for hours producing<br>work<br>um but in terms of a wider Community I<br>think<br>um<br>perhaps in terms of<br>I guess yeah I mean even before covet<br>artists uh we are already you know quite<br>quite<br>um<br>and I guess in terms of funding or like<br>you know how to support others<br>um it's already scarce like before covet<br>and<br>that's becomes you know one of the main<br>questions of our role as artists or<br>visual artists<br>like what do we how do we give back to<br>society that's you know<br>obviously<br>um suffering from various consequences<br>of this pandemic and<br>but then how do we keep you know being<br>creative<br>um during this time and<br>I guess as we all aware a lot of focus<br>and funding shift to you know healthcare<br>system which is<br>very important of course<br>um<br>but then it's you know does other<br>I guess what I'm trying to say is that<br>you know funding opportunities already<br>very rare and small before covet and now<br>you know as we<br>going into recession are probably<br>already in it<br>um<br>it's very worrying for artists and<br>especially those who are still you know<br>doing their undergraduate degrees in<br>universities<br>a lot of their learning process has been<br>through like Zoom video video learning<br>and it really took away a lot of<br>physical experience of<br>experimentation in your studio<br>dealing with materials that's you know<br>sometimes you have to go outside and<br>so yeah I can't really speak for younger<br>so your covert Jenny swapner how have<br>you think yeah I think actually<br>um lots of Silver Linings weirdly<br>um first of all I like being quite<br>solitary when I work so<br>um this was perfect conditions<br>um but also uh<br>children needed books children needed an<br>escape and so there was sort of a Mini<br>Boom over that period as I know<br>libraries were shut and bookshops were<br>shut but people adapted quickly<br>especially online services and so you<br>found that parents and teachers wanted<br>books and wanted<br>um author visits and so everything<br>quickly adapted to the online world and<br>it actually meant I got to visit more<br>schools than I ever would have and<br>visited schools in the UK and in America<br>as well as in New Zealand doing virtual<br>visits<br>um<br>and it gave teachers an hour off lasagna<br>because I dumped their faces off<br>um and uh gave parents an opportunity to<br>to have a bit of a break from their kids<br>because their heads were in a book so<br>um yeah I found it was quite<br>good for me and good for my work I just<br>moved and I think this was going to be a<br>test of whether Publishers stuck with me<br>because they're in in the UK they quite<br>like to have their authors on the ground<br>with them doing events and then when<br>they saw that it could be easily adapted<br>to the online World<br>um they stuck with me so I think it<br>actually worked in my favor in a weird<br>sort of way and probably didn't need to<br>have five million deaths to have my<br>Publishers stand by me but you know<br>um if we're looking for Silver Linings<br>there there was one there<br>um<br>yeah I think the thing is it just proved<br>that kids especially<br>kids reading books it's still important<br>people think that we've lost them to<br>YouTube and to tick tock and all sorts<br>of things but we haven't they needed<br>books they needed an escape they still<br>need stories<br>um and I think the the sort of two years<br>in lockdown or three years depending on<br>the country and prove that so if<br>anything I think<br>you know the the Market's always hard<br>anyway and Publishing is tricky to get<br>into but if anything it proved that we<br>still need books and stories it's very<br>encouraging yeah Sean and what was the<br>um I don't know I'm at the risk of<br>um breaking up the party on this one I<br>found it to be quite a negative<br>experience creatively you know it caused<br>me a lot of anxiety when it when this<br>pandemic rolled around I think always<br>been a sort of a fearful about such a<br>thing occurring and then it happened and<br>it's like oh my God you know and<br>um I find that I mean for me and what I<br>do<br>um<br>anxiety is not a good basis in which to<br>be creative even to get into the state<br>where you really want to play I think<br>it's just um<br>you know watched a lot of TV you know<br>the thing was that was my thing having<br>said that you know<br>living in basically it feeling like we<br>we're in a very privileged position in<br>New Zealand like it's been offed you<br>know remarked upon<br>you know coming out of that first period<br>of lockdown<br>having<br>sort of not been creative suddenly<br>there's a massive boost of Creative<br>um at the end of um<br>2021<br>and then promptly we went to lockdown<br>again and more anxiety and so I've only<br>just this album I completed last year<br>was only going to come out at the in the<br>end at the end of October<br>so very much a mixed blessing for me<br>um I I feel like the thing that I<br>possibly gained from it is<br>um a sort of uh coming out of that<br>period of not being creative and being<br>quite anxious is a sort of a seriousness<br>about what I was doing and going well I<br>really want to make this count<br>um which again is not always a good<br>thing sometimes you want to it's it is<br>music we talk about here and it's and<br>it's pop music too and sometimes the<br>throwaway nature of it the ephemeral<br>nature of it is actually what makes it<br>good this two thought about<br>maybe it doesn't say good so I don't<br>know<br>um but uh but definitely<br>I really discovered probably in not for<br>the first time in my life that being<br>being in the position of being anxious<br>about what you're doing is not a good<br>creative springboard<br>so it's a stopper in the in the bottle<br>really yeah<br>but during um during covert worldwide<br>and the lockdown um the Arts were sort<br>of lauded as an essential sort of<br>um ingredient for our sorry our mental<br>and spiritual health as a society sort<br>of worldwide<br>um do you feel then or now that that you<br>have got a responsibility with that<br>regard but since since the Arts and all<br>its facets was was met was finally sort<br>of realized as a uh important part of<br>our lives<br>um took took took Center Stage a little<br>bit more<br>no<br>well one of the things that came out of<br>the<br>covert situation was the<br>tentative balance or negotiation between<br>individual freedom and<br>Community responsibility and I think<br>that's something we have to<br>constantly renegotiate in terms of what<br>sort of societies we want to to live in<br>and as as I mentioned before I think<br>choreography or Community sorry not<br>Community choreography but Community<br>Dance is the very site of<br>investigating that you have dances where<br>there's very tight structures and<br>everybody does the same thing and it<br>feels a bit totalitarian and then you<br>have a ray everyone just does their own<br>thing and we have to find some balance<br>between those so one of the things I<br>love about a lot of the bowel folk<br>dancers that I've been sharing is that<br>they have<br>simple structures<br>that leave room for individual<br>creativity and improvisation but you<br>also have certain responsibilities<br>you've got to meet up with that person<br>there and you've got to do a daisy day<br>with that person there so this is sort<br>of a thinking tool for how we<br>think about those questions of<br>individual freedom and group<br>responsibility in the future<br>I'm just going to hop on that question I<br>think I think on underestimate<br>as to how the last few years have<br>affected children lots of them have<br>missed out like we've spoken before on<br>key moments in their educations formals<br>trips things like that the key bonding<br>moments as well and there's like height<br>and diet anxiety as well because kids<br>have not only been isolated but their<br>social media world has just sort of<br>stormed on ahead beyond anything that we<br>can grasp and I think it's really<br>important when you're writing books for<br>children to recognize that not only are<br>these books an escape but they may be<br>the only sort of place they can solve<br>problems like that or feel that they can<br>have their lives reflected back to them<br>so I think I'm more conscious of that<br>um moving forward with my work I'm I'm<br>not only just trying to produce books<br>that are fun and take kids away for a<br>bit but also books that are thoughtful<br>and you know help kids process some of<br>uh you know I reckon I mean we we<br>mentioned this earlier but I mean in my<br>industry and the music industry I think<br>that music industry in in the area of<br>making music<br>um and listening to music I think that<br>During the period of lockdown whereas<br>people might have been seeking out some<br>novelty in terms of that what they're<br>watching on screens or what they were<br>reading or whatever in the era of music<br>I think a lot of people were wanting to<br>go back to things that felt safe and<br>familiar musically you know there's a<br>lot of going back listening to<br>uh older music established artists and<br>um anything that was new or potentially<br>challenging was at odds with the<br>experience of being in lockdown so<br>um so just again possibly and I want to<br>bet you know I don't want to wax<br>negative uh in that way but a<br>disadvantage for anybody who's making<br>new music during that time<br>was that people weren't necessarily<br>looking I mean it's always exceptions of<br>course but people weren't necessarily<br>looking for new music they wanted things<br>that made them feel safe and familiar<br>and took them back to a time when they<br>um I'd like to ask you all one simple<br>question is when<br>is any individual work that you are<br>creating<br>when is it complete do you know when<br>I feel like it's never complete I could<br>Tinker with things forever but usually<br>there's quite physical point at which it<br>has to be complete and that's a deadline<br>yes and also wanting to be paid my next<br>Advance<br>um so yes that usually I I mean<br>essentially when you write a story this<br>magical thing happens with<br>it goes out and it becomes something<br>completely different to someone else and<br>then it becomes something completely<br>different to another reader and another<br>reader and you just have to let it go at<br>the end of the day so as much tinkering<br>as you want no one will ever interpret<br>your work the way you think they will<br>um so you just yeah usually a deadline<br>is the point of which I have to stop and<br>do you know when you're finished at work<br>um<br>no not really<br>sometimes I put something out and then I<br>don't actually completely understand the<br>word myself until years later and<br>sometimes you'd have to take that risk<br>that eventually when you get older<br>um<br>that a better understanding will come to<br>you rather than<br>reach to conclusion first and then it's<br>done here you take it it's sometimes I<br>put things out exhibited and hopefully<br>audience complete those works or I don't<br>um I mean I have artistic agenda and all<br>that but<br>I guess I'm very welcome for the<br>completion to be done by someone else or<br>in the future<br>and sometimes<br>I produce were<br>a series of different exhibitions even<br>though the forms and the context<br>contents are very completely different<br>I personally I connect them through this<br>kind of<br>personal threat<br>um<br>through different subjects and<br>yes sometimes new work relying on works<br>from five years ago to make sense<br>personally<br>um<br>yeah I don't know if that makes sense so<br>as a dancer and or choreographer when do<br>well I'm I'm not here uh in the<br>fellowship as a choreographer so I'm<br>going to say well the question of course<br>doesn't apply to community dance because<br>there's no end to it<br>um so I'm going to splitting Against the<br>Wind and say I know when something's<br>finished when I say to the people in my<br>class yes that's it that's one moment<br>that one's done a whilst turn is working<br>beautiful yes that's it I'm out of here<br>you can do it you take it away so I know<br>every time and when it's finished<br>because you've done it you've got it<br>right now now go ahead go and have fun<br>with it yeah<br>good uh<br>yeah I mean I think things just get<br>locked off don't they you mean you get<br>to a point where you for some reason you<br>can't continue and<br>um certainly with writing songs it's not<br>always advisable to keep going forever<br>but but I know for me finishing<br>something is just an opportunity for me<br>to feel bad about it later<br>I I really really wish I hadn't done<br>that bit or<br>um gosh that sounds indulgent or<br>whatever but there is sort of if you<br>look at more long term there's a sort of<br>a making piece with a finished<br>um you know with the finished piece<br>really finish yeah<br>it's interesting because that's actually<br>one of my questions here<br>so you know it's good that that do you<br>in hindsight look back at some of the<br>works which you have released<br>uh which have been published or<br>presented and think oh<br>I would have done it differently now or<br>I'm a bit embarrassed by that now is<br>that part of the the Journey of an<br>artist or just to continue on with my<br>rant I mean I feel this sort of a vague<br>sense of embarrassment about you know<br>there's always a slight feeling of<br>embarrassment I mean I went through a<br>stage in my career where I did a couple<br>of albums where I would go to cafes and<br>my music would be um playing and I'd uh<br>you know<br>or I just get it down and get out of<br>there but um you know I think you know<br>there are there there's a making piece<br>as you as you go on you know I think<br>with any art I'm sure it's the same with<br>with all of us except Michael<br>um<br>there is this a sort of a platonic ideal<br>of what you do and it's kind of You've<br>Got This brilliant idea in your head and<br>and sometimes it's very very vague and<br>you really don't know<br>when you get there you only know that<br>know that you didn't nail it and then it<br>takes you another few years to realize<br>exactly how you didn't nail it so um but<br>you know that's because writing songs<br>you just I mean have you ever how many<br>times do you ever listen to a song that<br>you like maybe you know<br>10 times 20 times song you really love a<br>hundred times I mean that's how many<br>times you<br>you know times<br>ridiculously more than that you have to<br>listen to a song when you're in the<br>process of creating it unless your<br>process is to just<br>something that's you know jazz or<br>extemporizing or whatever it's part of<br>you do or you have a Lo-Fi aesthetic or<br>whatever where you're just chucking it<br>out and moving on to the next thing but<br>there's an element of perfectionism and<br>what I do is I really have to listen to<br>things a lot and I really probably do<br>get kind of sick of them long before I'm<br>finished so<br>yeah I think writing is a craft is what<br>as much as an art so the more you do the<br>better you get at it and obviously as I<br>progress through my career<br>um there are things that I'm I'm perhaps<br>um<br>less proud of maybe or not not proud and<br>less proud of maybe just I just feel<br>like more recent works are yeah more<br>reflective of what I want to write I<br>think if you ever want to know which<br>book<br>um I feel slightly embarrassed of if<br>that's the fair way to put it is the one<br>I'm not promoting that's if I buried<br>that in the shelves then that's probably<br>the one<br>um yeah I always look back and think oh<br>I could have done this better<br>um but I think that's a bit there's a<br>perfectionist side you know that you<br>just kind of do that and so for me it's<br>just easier to move on and not keep<br>looking back at the last book just keep<br>moving on it can be a little indulgent<br>yeah go back and and you know internally<br>recoil too much because okay oh that's<br>done yeah yeah yeah there's an ex<br>there's an expression in the classes<br>that we're doing at the moment it's<br>become a little bit of a standing joke<br>um because somebody wants uh I can't<br>remember the context anyway the the<br>point of what I'm saying is that that<br>this this perfectionism is nicely<br>counted by uh uh child psychologist<br>Donald willicott who was<br>after Freud and uh Freud had made a lot<br>of mothers very anxious because he put<br>all the problems of child raising on<br>their bad up you know the the bad<br>upbringing of the parent the bad<br>parenting of the parents and a lot of<br>mothers were feeling very uh traumatized<br>by the role of motherhood and here<br>Donald came along and introduced this<br>idea of a mother doesn't have to be<br>perfect she just has to be good enough<br>so now when we're we're doing little<br>turns or something in class you know and<br>it doesn't have to be perfect it just<br>has to be good enough to get through and<br>uh get to the next movement and I think<br>it's a nice counter to this oh there was<br>something wrong with that you know it's<br>just it's just got to be good enough<br>yeah I used to get embarrassed about<br>past works but I guess<br>I'm sure all of us you know look back<br>when we're at our teenage selves and<br>it's embarrassing moments but I mean<br>your work your work is your history it's<br>even though you know it is embarrassing<br>work shameful work<br>um<br>yeah it's your it's your life records in<br>a way<br>um with uh the work that you create<br>whatever format it might be in or<br>discipline it is there's a there's a<br>sort of a letting go of it which we've<br>sort of touched on but um a book will<br>last forever a piece of music is<br>ephemeral dance is now and then it's not<br>there anymore<br>your works of art might be sold they're<br>not yours anymore<br>is that a is that a painful exercise in<br>actually giving your baby away<br>and you've got to give that baby away<br>you've got to get rid of it adopted out<br>to who will take it yeah<br>and then that's the whole point I mean<br>for me sometimes it's to share<br>um it's it's<br>I guess Visual Arts in a sentence are<br>it's a different forms of knowledge<br>production<br>it's a cultural production<br>um that meant to be shared and<br>it's it keeps<br>um history history moving forward or<br>going<br>um<br>but but I mean sometimes<br>yeah when you're dealing with organic<br>material<br>things meant to go away and that's you<br>know<br>the interioration that's fine<br>yeah I think my process of giving my<br>work away starts earlier than before it<br>hits the public because I have to give<br>away to my editor or to the illustrator<br>so it's gotten easier over time to take<br>feedback on that right<br>um but yeah I think in the first<br>instance probably on my with my first<br>book I probably found that quite hard to<br>let someone else get their hands on it<br>and interpret it in the way that I<br>hadn't perhaps intended but yes the<br>intention is that my books will go out<br>and that kids will read them so I am<br>the University of otago fellowships<br>I think they all state that it's<br>actually not<br>compulsory that you actually create<br>you don't have to deliver a body of work<br>when you're finished as before you leave<br>is that a freedom or an impediment<br>I think if I hadn't produced something<br>um yes when I first arrived<br>um I had Jane and Sylvia at the College<br>of Education who are really kind and<br>said you know you've got freedom you can<br>do what you want and there's no pressure<br>and that was freeing in some ways but I<br>had to you know personal pressure on my<br>shoulders that I wasn't going to walk<br>away from here without doing anything<br>and just pocket the money that would<br>have been really odd<br>um and I'm glad because that pressure<br>meant that I produced something that I'm<br>actually really proud of and I'm really<br>glad I now have that out of my brain and<br>now have space to create other things<br>yeah<br>okay she was you did have to well I did<br>have to do things but I've actually<br>ended up doing so much more and I<br>thought like we we have a a monthly<br>minibial at the foyer at toy and um that<br>was just meant to be well it wasn't<br>meant to be it was just something that<br>happened<br>um it wasn't part of my proposal at all<br>and there's quite a few things that<br>weren't in my proposal that I have<br>eventuated but at the last uh battle on<br>the previous Sunday uh the Director of<br>Events there asked us if we would<br>consider keeping the bowls going on past<br>the uh the time for the fellowship so<br>for me that's thrilling yeah yeah when<br>something that's meant to have a an in<br>life<br>um someone else is prepared to adopt it<br>and take it on and and pay the musicians<br>and everything that needs to be done<br>there great yeah<br>um<br>what would your year have looked like if<br>would have been a pretty scary year for<br>me I think yeah you know I haven't had<br>any music up for a while there's nothing<br>particularly in the Horizon it would<br>have been<br>that<br>um I mean<br>part of surviving as a musician or as a<br>composer of New Zealand is doing a lot<br>of things that aren't entirely your in<br>your hands undetirely you know you that<br>that curated by<br>uh you know filmmakers or in advertising<br>agencies or whatever you know maybe it's<br>production or something like that for<br>somebody else's music<br>so um<br>no I I I it literally couldn't have come<br>along at a bit of time for me and um<br>yeah I mean uh<br>I mean and to answer their last question<br>a little bit it's a tremendous freedom<br>I think it's tremendous freedom to be<br>given but it's a freedom that takes a<br>moment or two to acclimatize two as well<br>it's you used to<br>um<br>you know a sort of<br>a kind of a conditional freedom and um<br>you know with the fact that well I'll<br>get the chance to do this Within These<br>parameters but then I've got a look for<br>to make some money somehow or survive or<br>maybe I won't eat through all my family<br>might eat for a while I can't really get<br>them to do that unfortunately but that<br>um so so it's a tremendous Freedom<br>um and tremendously grateful like you<br>know I I can't say how great for I am<br>for the opportunity really yeah<br>yeah I think um it came along at the<br>right time for me as well I was probably<br>experiencing some level of burnout from<br>the last few years with deadlines and<br>um quite intense publishing schedules<br>and I need I had an excuse now to say to<br>Publishers can you just give me six<br>months<br>um and weirdly I've been probably the<br>most productive I've ever been in that<br>six months so as a result also have<br>produced beyond what I hope to and now<br>have four book deals off the back of<br>um the the work that I produced which is<br>obviously you know Financial stability<br>for the future as well so yeah this I am<br>incredibly grateful as well that I had<br>the opportunity to do this and just<br>um a little bit sad it was a bit short I<br>wish it was a bit longer<br>so what would your be like without the<br>fellowship<br>I think I would really be struggling<br>um<br>especially this year<br>it's been an incredibly busy year I had<br>six exhibitions already so<br>if I didn't get this opportunity I think<br>it came at the right time yeah because<br>we as artists having a studio space<br>that's the most important thing<br>um and as you know that it's not easy to<br>just hire a space<br>um these days especially you know if you<br>don't have<br>parents who you know own a house here in<br>this country it's really yeah where to<br>store your work or<br>um<br>yeah<br>um so it really did come at the right<br>time but it's I don't want a sugar coat<br>thing you know it's people people don't<br>understand sometimes people forget that<br>artists we don't clock hours like nine<br>to five Monday to Friday and I mean even<br>get getting this Fellowship I mean we<br>still don't get<br>um over time or sick leave you know and<br>this will continue after this Fellowship<br>so um<br>even though it's a<br>incredibly privileged opportunity it's<br>still I'm still conscious of the<br>precarious nature of my career if I can<br>for me I don't really think in terms of<br>what my life would have been like<br>without it but in terms of the amazing<br>things that have happened because of it<br>and particularly the people that I've<br>made the dances I've collaborated with<br>the musicians have been introduced to<br>the dance styles that I've never had<br>time to explore before I mean I'm I I'm<br>going to take have to take a year to<br>recover from the fellowship because it's<br>just been so intense and I've learned so<br>much and made so many amazing<br>connections with people that<br>um yeah it's it's been an extraordinary<br>opportunity in ways that I never foresaw<br>that's beautiful do um do any of you I<br>know perhapses are a little bit short<br>the fellowships but there hasn't been<br>any collaboration between any of you<br>artistically creatively at least I have<br>invited all my fellows to come to uh<br>I got struck down with Kobe and I had<br>made plans to come along we were talking<br>about those provocative moments but<br>um I don't think we've done any<br>collaborations but we we went along to<br>um so Albert Bells who's the playwright<br>he's not here because he's busy actually<br>working<br>um so sorry he's a proper job yeah he's<br>got a property<br>um so Sarah Michael and I went along to<br>one of his readings and I went along to<br>sorrowitz um opening of uh their<br>exhibition here<br>um so it's it's been really wonderful to<br>this has been a good bunch of fellows<br>um but yeah no collaborations yeah well<br>not yet not yet yeah life is long yeah<br>Sean's been dropping hints all afternoon<br>he's doing some choreography for a new<br>music video for his music and uh he's<br>been saying oh I'm not really a<br>choreographer<br>oh no I'm being facetious<br>just just offloading<br>um I'd like to maybe now um uh open to<br>the floor if there's anybody who would<br>uh have a question for any of the<br>fellows please<br>speak clearly oh and Johnny's got a<br>Wandering microphone a roving microphone<br>for those that wish to who have a<br>question<br>I'm just wondering about the future of<br>each of you<br>uh fellows what would you like to be<br>like in I won't say 10 years time five<br>years I just wondered about your future<br>um well obviously when I grow up I want<br>to be Michael<br>um but before that point<br>um I guess I just want um to be keep<br>writing I just um it's as much as I<br>whinge about writing I really love it I<br>love the interaction I get from the<br>readers I think writing for children is<br>an utter privilege so I know that you<br>know I've got a big responsibility but I<br>really love my job so I just want to<br>keep writing and I want to keep having<br>books that make kids happy and laugh and<br>think and I guess that's what I want to<br>yeah I I feel like it it's always frame<br>to me as<br>um<br>doing exactly what I'm doing right now<br>but sort of bigger and better in some<br>sort of way you know uh<br>it's pretty hard to I can't think that<br>far ahead<br>so it's just a sort of a vague<br>smiling at the future and hoping it<br>smiles back at me really I mean that's<br>what I that's what I you know I want to<br>write better music<br>um and uh have more people get to hear<br>it<br>that's the scary question<br>um I mean yeah considering the<br>yep precarious nature of a lot of<br>creative practitioners<br>especially<br>thinking you know being aware of the<br>state of<br>the world<br>um it's not very promising<br>um<br>but yeah it would it would be<br>I would be very lucky if I could<br>continue in the next five years<br>um<br>and hopefully you know it does<br>more opportunity like this<br>um a very good idea<br>well I I certainly want to be dancing<br>um in 20 years time<br>um and I if I look back and saw a<br>community of dancers that I'd help<br>nurture to dance with that would be<br>foreign<br>I have a question from the back corner<br>I'll ask one free necklace<br>um Jessica Palmer and the PVC of<br>humanities at otago so it's my lucky<br>pleasure to host these fellows<br>um I just wanted to pick up on the theme<br>there about social accountability social<br>responsibility in creativity and<br>particularly because University we talk<br>a lot more these days about our research<br>needing to be<br>um engaging with the community and being<br>socially accountable and socially<br>responsible and and you've covered that<br>a wee bit too I guess my question to you<br>was to what extent do you see that<br>role in your work of being of being<br>socially accountable or being involved<br>in what it is to be Community to what<br>extent does that<br>um damper creativity or does it bring it<br>alive<br>in general<br>well it depends what your community is<br>doing when you when you you know when<br>you give it to them if they're rejecting<br>it if they're making performancing you<br>know uh<br>ah<br>I never fail but to be enriched by my<br>smaller and wider community<br>um<br>when it's a positive interaction you<br>know with fellow musicians fellow<br>artists or whatever<br>and reflecting the place that I live in<br>in terms of what I do it's all positive<br>I sometimes feel in New Zealand<br>we have our priorities uh<br>with regard to the Arts a little wrong<br>you know<br>New Zealand seems to be a place that<br>produces a ridiculous amount of great<br>art and great writing and great music<br>and uh<br>really uh<br>punch it to use a sporting metaphor how<br>ironic it punches above its weight you<br>know<br>when it comes to the Arts and<br>maybe it's our the way<br>our way to just be a a little bit oh<br>that's good and and you know<br>you know went to the net next All Blacks<br>there's like a chip on my shoulder but I<br>don't really<br>um<br>but it was the Arts in terms of The<br>Wider Community I I just feel like<br>sometimes<br>the artists are good and audience isn't<br>always that great yeah<br>I'm going to jump in at the other end of<br>the table and the other end of the<br>question because<br>as a and in this context uh my past as a<br>choreographer and the facilitator role I<br>have now in Community Dance are exactly<br>the same I've always thought as a as a<br>choreographer that I was I had to be<br>creative in the middle of rush hour<br>traffic making a dance is not like<br>sitting at home uh working on your<br>laptop or writing a poem or something<br>like that you're in the middle of a mass<br>of people<br>um and it's a time pressure and you've<br>got to make a decision now and all of<br>those pressures are just what creativity<br>thrives on so I think having a social<br>Consciousness or engaging socially for<br>me anyway is is the bread and butter of<br>being creative<br>yeah yeah I completely agree with that<br>um<br>social accountability sometimes you know<br>does very difficult tensions that you<br>have to engage with<br>um<br>particularly some you know<br>how I deal with I mean Visual Arts<br>having a lot to do with representations<br>and<br>um<br>sometimes I put work out there you know<br>for<br>just to add into the conversations that<br>perhaps<br>not not is not very common or maybe not<br>exist in terms of<br>you know what is my role as an artist<br>um that is both that that is neither<br>pakeha or Maori and what is that<br>conversation of being a toei we added to<br>to that conversation of you know New<br>Zealand art history<br>um<br>so yeah it's sometimes it can be a<br>difficult tension to navigate but<br>it's also yeah it brings your work<br>um<br>it makes your work I guess alive and<br>and active<br>um<br>within that dialogue of you know um<br>cultural new producing new cultural<br>knowledge<br>yeah I think my work is led by<br>society and themes and<br>but I don't let it I don't think it<br>dampers in the way you know it doesn't I<br>don't feel like it leads it completely I<br>don't feel obliged to follow what<br>say Society wants me to write and if<br>anything I want to write books that do<br>reflect diverse society and you know if<br>we take publishing as it currently is it<br>would probably encourage me to write<br>slightly less diverse books<br>um so yeah<br>um I don't I do think it dampers if<br>anything it enhances it you know knowing<br>that there's an audience out there that<br>wants more diverse books to read<br>hmm<br>I assume from time to time your creative<br>wells will run dry<br>do you have tools that you use to<br>refresh it yes it's called Disney plus<br>everybody gets that and watches it<br>non-stop I I refill by engaging in other<br>Arts so watching movies reading books is<br>a big one for me and going to our<br>exhibitions going to music concerts<br>dancing you know everything so that's<br>how I create<br>um I pull from that well and that gets<br>uh for me it's um<br>there's there's a sort of a tendency<br>sometimes if you're not making artists<br>to kind of force the issue a little bit<br>and that's generally not good<br>um my time has been spent if I'm if I'm<br>is creating the situation in which art<br>can flourish I.E building a bit of<br>sandpit to play in you know<br>um reading more or listening more<br>perfecting my chops somehow so that when<br>the moment strikes you know I'm ready to<br>to get the lightning in the bottom so to<br>sometimes I stay with it<br>um<br>let it simmer and like completely<br>accepting that<br>I need a pause or the pause is important<br>to the process to be able to continue<br>um but then also you know completely<br>shift away from what you're dealing with<br>going outside going for like<br>whenever I get stuck I just copy other<br>people<br>I look around at what they've got that I<br>haven't got that I want some of that so<br>I'll look at dances on YouTube and copy<br>them until I embody that movement and<br>then my vocabulary movement is released<br>because I never copy in the same way<br>because I'm a different person so I'm<br>not taking their stuff they're just<br>provoking me into a new way of<br>discovering what I do so yeah I go and<br>copy people<br>this is being recorded<br>um so so those um those moments of um<br>The Emptiness they they're just part of<br>the process you've got to learn to live<br>with them rather than be frightened by<br>them yeah yeah it's part of a part of<br>the journey yeah<br>beautiful well if there's any more<br>questions from the floor well yes we do<br>have another one at the back<br>I don't know that we've considered<br>Dunedin in this University yes but<br>Dunedin any influences particularly over<br>you in this last in this year or an<br>impact of actually being in the city<br>um just the just the geography of the<br>place really you know I mean I I just<br>end up walking everywhere and I love it<br>I don't find it very inspiring the weird<br>shape of the streets in this place how<br>they they their streaks for a while in<br>and they're sort of Alleyways for a<br>while and the steps and their streaks<br>against all the same street you know or<br>not you know like like the weird way<br>even a strip of grass can be a street in<br>some places you know and the houses the<br>houses all seem to fit together but<br>they're all different<br>you know I I in the shape of the hills<br>um the way you always you can't go<br>anywhere in a straight line unless you<br>live in South Dunedin you have to you<br>always have to go up and down a few<br>times before you get there I just find<br>that tremendously inspiring as a place<br>so yeah a chance from Auckland<br>no um yeah I agree with<br>um uh geography and geology incredibly<br>exciting complicated complex place<br>um<br>just found out when I got here that the<br>whole Harbor is an ancient volcano<br>um and then yeah incredibly diverse<br>range of different kinds of rocks<br>um<br>and history like culturally socially<br>um<br>yeah I'm very rich I don't think I ever<br>really thought about it but um now I do<br>I've done the most amount of writing and<br>I've had the most<br>success with my writings having moved to<br>Dunedin so there's definitely something<br>something in the water yeah<br>and for me certainly I couldn't have<br>experienced what I've experienced here<br>in any other city in New Zealand of this<br>Fellowship it's not that it's given me<br>time just to spend in the studio but<br>it's been<br>meeting with my own cultural heritage my<br>family from here<br>um but also the cultural traditions of<br>this place and the incredibly diverse<br>range of dance communities that there<br>are in Indonesian<br>um it just astounded me and I've I've<br>made the most of it engaged with them so<br>I couldn't have done what I've been<br>doing anywhere else<br>lovely<br>golden Eden<br>it's now half past two I think we'll<br>call it a day thank you all very much<br>for coming I would like to acknowledge<br>Professor Jessica Palmer PVC and Jasmine<br>Miller who has organized
