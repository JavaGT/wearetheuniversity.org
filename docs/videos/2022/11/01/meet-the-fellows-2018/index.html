fellows it's<br>also a pleasure to introduce our<br>wonderful convener and chair Nicholas<br>McBride director of Arts Festival<br>Dunedin and he in turn will introduce<br>the fellows so thank you Nicholas and<br>I'm going to hand over to you thank you<br>we'll wait for some police comments<br>thank you Linda um welcome to everybody<br>it's lovely to see you all here this<br>forum is an opportunity<br>um for us to hear from the fellows<br>um about their Journey as uh creative<br>artists<br>some of them have already done public<br>performances or events and there will be<br>more during this year so this this<br>afternoon is an opportunity to hear them<br>talking about their creative process<br>it's not a show and tell<br>um<br>if any time during this afternoon you<br>can't hear us then we'll just move<br>forward or something so that you um<br>we're speaking to where microphones more<br>clearly<br>but if you can't just shout and we'll<br>adjust things<br>so the the university fellowships um<br>have been in existence for well over 50<br>years uh not all of them<br>um and they're actually a huge Testament<br>to the University of otago's commitment<br>to the creative process<br>Charles Brash wrote in landfall in<br>1959 he said<br>part of a University's proper business<br>is to act as a nurse to the Arts or more<br>exactly<br>to the imagination as it expresses<br>itself in the Arts and Sciences<br>imagination May flourish anywhere<br>but it should flourish as a matter of<br>course in a university for it is only<br>through imaginative thinking that<br>Society grows materially and<br>intellectually<br>that quote is actually on the Arts<br>fellows website which goes on to say<br>that the fellowships have a vital role<br>to play<br>we rely on the fellows and their craft<br>to generate experiences<br>that will challenge entertain provoke<br>and reassure us<br>so let's um what the University of<br>otago's websites is about the fellows so<br>I'd like to introduce the 2018 fellows<br>in no particular order but in the order<br>that they're sitting which funnily<br>enough this has got anything to do with<br>anything but um I just wrote all their<br>names down yesterday<br>and when we came in today I just said<br>sit wherever you like and they're all<br>sitting bar one in exactly the same<br>place so that's pretty spooky don't you<br>think it bodes well for something<br>it's good uh Mozart fellow<br>Dylan ladelli<br>on the end here<br>Rianne Gallagher is the burns fellow<br>the Francis Hodgkin's fellow is Louisa<br>Menzies<br>and these two were around the wrong way<br>on the end<br>um uh Raymond Huber is one moment<br>Raymond Huber is the University of otago<br>College of Education creative New<br>Zealand children's writer in Residence<br>we actually had a conversation about<br>this at lunchtime about how we could<br>everybody gets tired when when that name<br>is mentioned when the title is given we<br>need to work on that<br>um and the Caroline Plummer Fellowship<br>in community dance is this year held by<br>Matthew Smith<br>the fellows<br>so<br>um I'd like to start this afternoon by<br>asking each of the fellows to tell us a<br>little bit about their career to date<br>to do with me you're on the end Okay so<br>the creative Journey when did that start<br>yeah<br>well<br>it's quite difficult because I think as<br>a child you're not really aware and you<br>can't articulate them<br>things that are happening but I I can<br>remember back<br>um<br>having a<br>type of need to to create sounds and I<br>used to invent instruments and I would<br>make them and my parents garage<br>because we didn't have instruments at<br>home and then my sister didn't decided<br>to learn to play the guitar she was a<br>number of years older than me so that<br>became the the instrument of the house<br>and since<br>went on to<br>study Qatar and a number of instruments<br>and towards the end of high school and<br>then I enrolled into University in<br>Wellington I did a degree<br>in composition as well as guitar<br>performance<br>so I hadn't really considered<br>writing music before then and then<br>there's a whole world that opened up<br>when I met the teachers especially in<br>the Jack body if people might have heard<br>of<br>UMass Ross Harris these very important<br>teachers<br>and especially Jack buddy he had an<br>interest in in our region in the world<br>the Pacific<br>southeast Asia North Asia as well<br>um<br>so sort of when I glanced back it sort<br>I guess it these<br>um meetings of these peoples that have<br>made me realize that this was what I was<br>actually leading up to and<br>um<br>what I was sort of striving for so I I<br>had an interest in<br>sort of things I couldn't understand<br>languages that I didn't know<br>um<br>so through my music studies I it's also<br>studying Japanese<br>language<br>um and through jack body I was able to<br>spend a lot of time in Japan China and<br>Korea and you can see how all these<br>cultures<br>um sort of influence each other<br>they're sort of getting off the point I<br>know<br>um so that gives a bit of a background<br>up until now I've<br>since I did my degree<br>I've been fortunate enough to<br>when I finished University I was able to<br>work with an orchestra full time and<br>then I went on to study in Germany and<br>that<br>sort of opened<br>my mind to so many possibilities such a<br>rich tradition<br>that carried through for<br>A Thousand Years<br>that<br>yes and the respect they have for for<br>Sonic arts in in Europe is something I<br>sort of a bit foreign to me to begin<br>with but<br>um<br>it's a yeah that excitement of learning<br>about the world has led me to want to<br>bring all of those experiences back here<br>and show people the possibility and of<br>music and that music has no limitations<br>really<br>it's a journey it's a journey thank you<br>Brienne<br>um your career and your artistic journey<br>to date how come you're here<br>that's if I start at the beginning then<br>wait no okay we'll just<br>just say it<br>um<br>I mean I guess as a as a kid I actually<br>had quite a bit of difficulty with<br>language at primary school<br>and I suppose my<br>pleasure as a kid was we're not was more<br>through the oral that was kind of where<br>I first engaged<br>so<br>um<br>sort of singing and I was brought up a<br>Roman Catholic so the prayers were kind<br>of recited in a very rhythmic way and<br>also as as a kid our prayer made a real<br>impression because<br>um<br>seemed the adults<br>when they were praying everything about<br>them changed<br>and I thought I<br>these prayer words are really powerful<br>words<br>yeah so<br>uh and I was held back a bit in Primary<br>School<br>but then I remember the day I learned to<br>you know I couldn't initially I couldn't<br>get uh these I could get the work you<br>know I had the words and then there were<br>these things on the page and I couldn't<br>understand I couldn't get this<br>relationship at all<br>um<br>yeah and then I the day I learned to<br>read<br>was I still remember that day and um<br>it was like<br>uh being introduced to this<br>magical thing you know like words seem<br>to take on<br>I know I'd got initiated or something<br>you know I've been I've been letting and<br>because of the difficulty before I think<br>the words words just<br>yes so then I I kind of caught up in<br>primary school I remember the I suppose<br>the other thing at primary school was<br>the first time I wrote a poem which<br>we were told to write a poem in our I<br>went to a country primary school so uh<br>the introduction to poetry was all the<br>ballads that we used that the teacher I<br>think was just an excuse for him to<br>smoke is pipe but um<br>we would have afternoons of him reading<br>ballads and then uh we were told we had<br>you know had to write a poem so I didn't<br>have much to go by except<br>and so the poem I tried to write as a<br>which was about Dusk and as<br>um I just love that our at dusk as a kid<br>when you could hang out on the street<br>and it wasn't time to go in but<br>everything<br>that the night was coming and<br>so I tried to write a poem about that<br>and um there was a line in the poem<br>about how the birds had stopped singing<br>and my teacher<br>said to me at the time like he<br>I just remember being beside him at the<br>desk and him saying something about the<br>poem and he said oh yes and this the<br>bird stopped singing that could mean<br>it could mean these other things it<br>could mean something was going to happen<br>like it could mean there was going to be<br>an earthquake or<br>and so that was my introduction to<br>Metaphor I think but I didn't know at<br>the time that I just thought oh my<br>goodness<br>I can say these things<br>and they can say all these other things<br>and it always seemed to me<br>that there were a lot of things that<br>were not being said directly and as<br>among adults and then I found<br>in poetry<br>is possible to say one thing and it will<br>mean potentially these other things so<br>that was another kind of<br>thing about language so we<br>yeah so when it was a long journey from<br>it's interesting listening to both of<br>you speak about<br>um your childhood because I<br>um my formation as an artist that far<br>back necessarily<br>um and yeah I would I would say it was<br>really only<br>um at University age that the idea of<br>being an artist even appeared to me or<br>began to crystallize<br>um I can glance back and see examples<br>now of<br>an interest in<br>or a creative drive that I I guess I had<br>but I didn't formally study art at<br>school<br>um<br>but I remember some very<br>Vivid experiences with artworks<br>um actually I happen to have been<br>reflecting recently on my experience of<br>a Ralph Hall 3 show at the uh in the<br>the gallery I think it was called the<br>annex that used to be part of the art<br>center in Christchurch that I would have<br>seen probably at about age 15 that I've<br>realized had a very strong impact on me<br>but I think in a way anything you see<br>that age has a strong impact<br>but yeah I uh I really came to Art I<br>think through curiosity and through an<br>interest in yeah in the visual world but<br>also just an information and experience<br>and how you might get your<br>finding out there for your subjectivity<br>that<br>could include a lot of different things<br>and maybe that's what I value about<br>being an artist the most is that<br>I feel like that activities that are<br>allows me to do<br>include like<br>interviews include drawing include<br>filming include travel include I feel<br>like it's just this I guess actually<br>it's not my idea you hear people talk<br>about<br>um as a kind of World building exercise<br>and I feel like I just get to share How<br>oh you're sorry I really should have<br>said that I meant to thank you for<br>asking<br>um I I grew up in Canterbury<br>um I was born in Lincoln I spent a lot<br>of time on banks peninsula in North<br>Canterbury also<br>um<br>in my childhood and then I studied I did<br>my undergraduate degree in Wellington<br>the Finance degree was just beginning at<br>Massey University and I was in their<br>first intake of students which was<br>a great opportunity there was a<br>wonderful energy in that in that school<br>at that time and with a whole lot of new<br>people starting a program<br>I spent some time in Wellington<br>afterwards and I was quite involved with<br>an artist-run project space called enjoy<br>and then I subsequently moved to<br>Auckland where I've been based for about<br>10 years now until I have been here in<br>thank you Louisa uh Raymond Huber<br>well just following on from what Louisa<br>was saying I grew up in Canterbury and<br>in those days in Christchurch at least<br>they had a whole Library a whole<br>building devoted to children's books<br>children's libraries scattered around<br>the city and my mother was one of the<br>volunteers who worked in that Library so<br>no surprise that the children's writer<br>would be inspired by going every day<br>after school and sitting in a library<br>and uh it was things like Tintin books<br>which I would just sit there for hours<br>and hours and hours reading<br>but also just from just listening to<br>read and talking about<br>um about school<br>reminded me of the very first experience<br>of school I had walking in the very<br>first time and it's probably my only<br>memory of those primary school years<br>walked in the kids are all sitting on<br>the mat and the teacher was reading<br>Horton Hatches the Egg<br>and I think it did have a profound<br>influence on me just that whole it was<br>well it was starting school of course it<br>was going to but then there was this<br>book which to completely captivated me<br>and you know that was the start of my<br>school Journey really and the other<br>incident that from school that that<br>jumps out at me is<br>we had to write a report on a what they<br>called a nature trip in those days which<br>involved in our walk through the Bush on<br>banks peninsula and so I thought I'd be<br>a bit cheeky and kind of Twisted a bit<br>and I wrote about how the teacher fell<br>into a bush of stinging nettle and had<br>to take his trousers off and and the<br>teacher I was shocked he read out all<br>the assignments and he came to mind and<br>read it out<br>and everyone laughed and it was that<br>shot of you know audience response I<br>think that has also stayed with me for a<br>long time when it comes to writing and<br>um so so are those kind of influences as<br>a child and the fact that I love books<br>and I wasn't so much into writing<br>actually until a lot later<br>um<br>win and I think probably about the time<br>Tom I was at Teachers College and Trish<br>Brooking was had a children's literature<br>course there they still do children's<br>literature although it's not a specific<br>course now and that was utterly<br>inspiring and got me reading<br>children's books again and help me to<br>see that children's literature was an<br>art form and then I rev I reviewed books<br>for a long time and I thought I really<br>want to write books and<br>there was an inner voice which I'm told<br>is common amongst children's writers<br>where you imagine a child inside<br>yourself and that's the child that<br>you're writing for and an editor said to<br>me once so you do realize that writers<br>get stuck<br>at a particular age they're writing for<br>and I thought I'm not going to do that<br>but actually I do have a particular<br>little um 10 year old boy I think in<br>Saving which I um who I write for most<br>of the time so I just kind of write<br>stuff that would entertain that inner<br>child and<br>and I think in just to race during my<br>writing career I think the other thing<br>was being a teacher about the only thing<br>I really loved was reading to kids<br>reading out loud to kids and I realized<br>that the power of books to hold them<br>there and get them to behave was just<br>amazing<br>and does that power still there do you<br>Matthew<br>hello the floor is yours great how are<br>you getting on very good<br>um<br>it's quite a challenge to think about<br>how your artistic career is you know and<br>try and compress that in a short space<br>of time and as I sit and listen to the<br>other art humans here I realize in some<br>to some extent I<br>um I'm a kind of imposter on the panel<br>in some ways because uh I have a kind of<br>Duality about my process<br>um because I'm both interested in art<br>but I'm also immensely interested in<br>science and when I was at secondary<br>school I mean these are formative<br>periods<br>um<br>I did Art and art history and I came<br>across the concept of a renaissance man<br>and I found that really appealing I felt<br>and you know we looked at people like<br>Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci and<br>these uh amazing marriage between<br>science and art and like they're not so<br>separate like we we put them in<br>different faculties in the University<br>but maybe the processes are closer than<br>we uh you know care to admit maybe<br>sometimes<br>and so if I look at my life I feel like<br>that's what I've been about is trying to<br>find a marriage between these different<br>um disciplines and uh I think as a I was<br>super interested in physicality as a kid<br>but I was also a nerd and so I I I I<br>like the intellectual life and but I<br>didn't want to<br>follow that without the expense of my<br>body like I wanted to to to learn and<br>and grow without becoming sedentary and<br>and uh so I think that's<br>um part of part of my journey<br>um<br>and that's what I'm doing with my with<br>my projects it's a marriage between uh<br>the influence of science uh and and<br>studying humans for for outcomes<br>scientifically measurable but also like<br>investigating<br>um the experiential the unknown I think<br>uh one of the things you learn as a<br>dancer is uh and as a as a maker a<br>creative maker is to sit in the<br>uncomfortable place of Unknowing where<br>you don't know<br>what you're going to produce you uh it's<br>uncomfortable it's nerve-wracking<br>um and you're looking for answers and<br>you become obsessed with that process<br>so the creative processes that I've been<br>I've made a few Works overseas and also<br>in New Zealand<br>my own choreographies and uh they're not<br>so different from writing a thesis which<br>I recently did for<br>um for osteopathy so uh<br>you get obsessed you need time to to<br>contemplate you're looking for answers<br>your brain is functioning in ways that<br>you don't know and you wake up in the<br>morning with answers ah I could put this<br>movement with that movement or maybe<br>this measure could be used in a<br>physiological study for dancers<br>so so yeah so um and and as a dancer you<br>need to understand your own body so you<br>need to understand your physics and you<br>intersect with the the health<br>um industry you intersect with<br>osteopaths and they seem so<br>knowledgeable or physios understand the<br>body you absorb that knowledge because<br>your body is your instrument so you want<br>to get on top of that so when I went to<br>University I studied firstly I started<br>at history and philosophy and I'm like<br>oh no I'm getting drawn towards Arts<br>that I want to do science and I want to<br>dance because I just want to do that so<br>the only place I could do that was for<br>Zed school and uh and then I'm like okay<br>I'll do hard Sciences as part of that<br>because maybe I'll go in that route and<br>then I left that all to train as a<br>dancer and now I've come come back to it<br>through through osteopathy yeah so my<br>projects are kind of weaving those<br>together sounds like an artist isn't he<br>and you don't need to feel bad about<br>that because as I said Charles Brash in<br>his statement says that the imagination<br>as expresses itself in its and Sciences<br>so it's okay<br>and they had to merge that all together<br>um thank you all<br>um I just like to now move on to the uh<br>General concept of<br>uh what your creative process is<br>how you get your inspiration or if there<br>is such a thing<br>or is it all just perspiration and the<br>sort of the methodology by which you<br>actually create<br>at work<br>so creative process inspiration and<br>methodology who's going to start with<br>that idea<br>this is not a free lunch doesn't exist<br>no but well just generally speaking I<br>mean where do you where do you start<br>from you know I mean what<br>yeah the creative process and and you<br>get your inspiration from something or<br>is it different every time you do<br>something is there no is there no<br>pattern to your creative process I<br>always write what I'm interested in you<br>know I hate having to write about<br>something that is popular or will sell<br>or those kind of things yeah so always<br>start at that point what am I interested<br>in the moment<br>hey trees have got these fungal networks<br>that are like the internet and they<br>communicate and they send food and<br>messages underground to trees that are<br>miles around the forest hey I could<br>write about that because that interests<br>me and saying I've written a couple of<br>books about that now during this um<br>Fellowship so for me it's it's like the<br>ideas are not hard to find like science<br>um as you're saying Matthew is just<br>chocker the natural world with fantastic<br>ideas so okay it's always my starting<br>point and then what's the method then so<br>if you've had that idea do you lock<br>yourself away on a daily basis which you<br>can do I guess with the fellowship is<br>there sort of a routine in the way you<br>actually then get to where you want to<br>go well writing's easy it's just putting<br>one word after another in it we should<br>all be able to do that shouldn't we<br>that's right<br>I think rewriting's the Habit<br>you've got to rewrite and rewrite and<br>yeah keep on refining Dylan<br>process inspiration<br>um methodology<br>inspiration<br>um often arises from<br>responding to<br>observations<br>with the Sonic World well not always<br>Sonic for me um<br>visual things as well and how I can<br>represent that through a time-based<br>um<br>you know the components and the<br>molecules that that make up<br>the things that we listen to and how I<br>can unpick it and reassemble it in<br>different ways and through like the<br>medium of<br>of instruments that have evolved<br>um<br>through<br>um<br>through timeline instruments of these<br>expressive tools that have risen from<br>this certain need and of that humans<br>have to to make sound so I work a lot<br>with<br>um<br>what instruments what's afforded to them<br>physically so that the mechanics that<br>um<br>make up what they actually are and how I<br>can<br>manipulate that<br>and what the resulting sounds can be<br>from that as well<br>do you um as a composer do you what do<br>you use do you use a pen and paper do<br>you sort of a keyboard or do you sit at<br>a keyboard<br>two kinds of keyboard<br>all of that<br>well I<br>first of all it starts starts on my mind<br>then<br>I tended to work on an instrument<br>improvising<br>um<br>some coaxing different sounds out of out<br>of that whether it's a clarinet or a<br>violin<br>or your voice or or Electronics<br>um<br>and then I will go about notating that<br>with with pencil and paper<br>which gets put into a machine eventually<br>the end do you want to say anything<br>about your process and your inspiration<br>and I didn't know any poets have any<br>pressure from<br>popularity of making money<br>um<br>it's the process I mean I keep a<br>notebook<br>um<br>and sometimes<br>things happen outside of that you know<br>that I just get something that comes<br>that doesn't happen very often but at<br>once but actually for the C Cliff work<br>it's been a very different process I've<br>been working looking at the sea cliff<br>asylum in relation to early Irish<br>migrants and<br>um<br>so the lead into that was really doing<br>an enormous amount of reading<br>um<br>and then refining what I'd done from<br>that largely by a kind of intuition<br>Instinct thing<br>but the thing about the reading was it's<br>kind of all outside and I can't write as<br>a poet unless I write From the Inside<br>Out rather than coming from the outside<br>so there was lots I've been down quite a<br>few cul-de-sacs and things and but I've<br>had some really good moments as well<br>like breaking into a voice calm and<br>breaking into something that's in prose<br>which was way out of my<br>kind of comfort zone uh writing and<br>prose and when that's that piece started<br>actually I<br>um I felt like there was this energy<br>field and I really wanted to keep<br>writing but I was so mistrustful of the<br>sentence it was like writing with the<br>bricks on us<br>do you get um frustrated you just said<br>there you end up in a cold step a<br>cul-de-sac is that uh artistically<br>frustrating in like a waste of time or<br>is it going to back up and then end up<br>somewhere else which you wouldn't have<br>ended up if you hadn't gone down that<br>Cola stack in the first place well I<br>think it's what's already been said<br>really in the sense that it's<br>uncomfortable it's very uncomfortable<br>um<br>yeah so<br>and I think I mean I felt<br>um I did have a there was a kind of<br>point where I thought I'm not sure<br>whether I can do this like I'm not sure<br>if I can make something happen with this<br>material so and you hover a little on<br>that uncertainty for a time and<br>um I just had to keep trusting actually<br>and<br>um<br>yeah so was it yeah and then when<br>something does happen even if you know<br>in a couple of these early pieces I<br>think won't make the cut but actually<br>they open something up for me so yeah<br>you had a time to think I haven't I can<br>always call on my notes okay<br>but I maybe I'll just follow on from the<br>idea of trust because I think that's<br>really it's something I relate to and I<br>think yeah it's kind of yeah there are a<br>lot of there are a lot of ideas around<br>um but it's kind of about trusting that<br>one will go somewhere and it's kind of<br>about what you do with it something I<br>guess and<br>gifts in my work I'm<br>uh so sound incredibly General but I'm<br>just interested in<br>how things are already<br>how how I and how I find something an<br>image for example and the format it's in<br>the format might be as compelling to me<br>for some reason as<br>teacher<br>um or if it's an event then I guess it's<br>also the<br>context that it happened in and<br>um<br>I I think<br>I work with a range of media for the<br>reason that<br>um they're all interesting to me and so<br>I might I've made a number of film on 16<br>millimeter I've organized performances<br>I've made artist books<br>um lately I've been making paper itself<br>and setting copies of archival material<br>just embedding them and back in the in<br>the material itself<br>um so<br>I guess somehow I draw in a lot of<br>perhaps diverse processes material<br>processes but there's a playing out<br>of<br>um I guess like representation itself<br>it's kind of driving<br>those things and<br>increasingly I've become interested in<br>the way that<br>images if you like kind of attach<br>themselves to us<br>how actually we see something and then<br>in a small way it kind of enters our<br>being you know when we might then carry<br>around that way of seeing something or<br>you know it goes on to inform how you<br>see something else I'm just grabbing<br>something very basic in a way but I've<br>become really<br>um<br>driven by that idea of how do images<br>start to kind of index themselves to<br>biography and so<br>as a way to work on that I I have images<br>in the studio I'm really I'm trying to<br>look at quite deeply trying to think<br>with as well<br>um<br>often I use other people's work in my in<br>my work<br>I'm interested in those relationships<br>and I guess sometimes I just desire to<br>maybe<br>put something back in circulation again<br>and that might just you know you could<br>think of an exhibition I think as a<br>place to do that as a venue to<br>put something back out in the world<br>um<br>so yeah<br>I don't know if I<br>addressed inspiration but I think I<br>Matthew do you want to touch on on your<br>inspiration or your methodology sure<br>um I'll just start with methodology I<br>think um<br>whatever methods that you employ will<br>determine a lot the outcome obviously so<br>um<br>in in an artistic process I I observed<br>um different dance makers applying the<br>same methodology and uh and that would<br>yield a kind of<br>um outcome that was somewhat predictable<br>or formulaic for that artist<br>and so one of the things that I consider<br>in my process is that the methodology<br>itself is something to be manipulative<br>manipulated<br>and so that they uh in order to<br>guarantee that the outcome uh may be<br>different from what I could possibly<br>imagine uh On My Own by myself or that<br>is different from the things that I've<br>that have gone before so um other things<br>that I've made so I'm looking you know<br>to adapt to be adaptive with with the<br>methodology<br>and in terms of inspiration<br>um<br>I am I think I like to draw on the<br>different aspects of of performance so I<br>am not so much interested in<br>um observing dancers as machines<br>executing although I participated in<br>choreographies like that but um dancers<br>like machines executing a grand design<br>I'm more interested in uh feeling the<br>complexity of a person<br>performing and so there are strategies<br>that you can work with that I've worked<br>with that can generate that outcome so I<br>think of a human being as someone who's<br>engaged in a state of flux where<br>um<br>with his uncertainty with his decision<br>making and so in the creative processes<br>I try to create tasks that that um that<br>occupy the dancer so that they're in<br>that state where as opposed to a dancer<br>who performs and goes this is it I know<br>exactly what I'm doing you know like<br>this is there's nothing negotiated here<br>I'm just showing you with my body a form<br>whereas I like I'm interested in the<br>performance with the person you can feel<br>that they're thinking that they're um<br>they're alive there's some uncertainty<br>they may be making a decision in that<br>moment so task based choreography<br>yeah that was some of my Inspirations<br>scary for the dancer I would think that<br>sort of improvisation almost yeah but<br>highly structured because you know no<br>structure you can get lost okay and I've<br>had experiences with like an audition<br>processes where they'll throw out so<br>just show us your best<br>to me I need some leads so yes I need<br>some structure yeah get lost yeah end up<br>dancing like a madman yeah<br>move on<br>so I'm gonna ask you all now<br>um who<br>um is your work for are you creating for<br>yourself for your public for your<br>audience<br>um and does this affect your creative<br>process in other words the end result is<br>is it are you thinking about where it's<br>going to end up as you actually create<br>but on that yeah<br>um I was just actually saying um before<br>the panel that<br>um I've just started to think about my<br>exhibition<br>um which comes up at the end of the<br>Francis Hodgkin's Fellowship set the<br>it it helped me see that often for me it<br>works finished in an exhibition it might<br>not really feel finished until then so<br>I've actually come to really enjoy<br>thinking about that as a space for the<br>work to kind of do something and so I<br>guess<br>um I guess that's what I make work for<br>and I often see an exhibition<br>as a kind of unit to work with or<br>something and<br>um<br>uh it's<br>it's I I think that it's a kind of it's<br>almost a cliche now to say this but yeah<br>I think it works kind of only half made<br>by me it's always made completed by<br>people who engage with it and<br>a kind of amazing thing about<br>being an artist is after a while an old<br>work I work from a while ago it just<br>starts to actually create its own life<br>every time it's shown<br>um its story slightly changes or yeah<br>um you really I get the feeling that<br>yeah works really take on their own<br>their own Journey once once they've left<br>my<br>so are you<br>um are you always mindful of your<br>audience as you go through your creative<br>process<br>yeah well<br>initially I<br>does feel like I'm writing for myself<br>um<br>first and foremost<br>but then the concepts I'm working with<br>sort of rely on a listener<br>to<br>for them to have an effect<br>um<br>so I think one of the beauties of music<br>is can be interpreted in so many<br>different ways<br>um<br>with a lot of my<br>working with issues of memory<br>I think we understand music through<br>memory through repetition or the<br>opposite of repetition through a like a<br>linear process nothing repeats<br>um<br>so<br>yeah so if music is open to so many<br>interpretations but I can guarantee and<br>relay that everybody knows what it feels<br>like to to grasp for something like a<br>Mary that's faded well that's not there<br>we've reconstructed<br>differently from the reality of what it<br>was<br>um<br>I am writing for for listeners<br>yeah to have it um in order for it to<br>have an impact an effect<br>okay good it's interesting because I<br>know that I we've had one Mozart fellow<br>I think here many years ago who was<br>writing because he needed to and was not<br>the slightest but concerned if it was<br>ever performed it was all about his own<br>journey and it if anybody what was<br>interested in it that was a bonus so he<br>was absolutely writing from a<br>itself<br>perspective yeah interesting<br>um so uh Rhian do you<br>um is your create is your process<br>um in writing poetry<br>are you bearing in mind the fact that<br>you're hoping that it's going to be<br>published and will be there for be<br>um<br>enjoyed or<br>again who's your audience when are you<br>aware of your audience as you're writing<br>um<br>uh no no right uh it's a short answer<br>not not at the very beginning anyway no<br>I'm writing for myself<br>um<br>and actually it's been interesting this<br>year uh just<br>one of the most productive things I've<br>done is kind of let go attachment to<br>outcome whether that be whether that be<br>in writing one poem or now as I'm<br>starting to think about I manuscript but<br>um<br>just to keep it very fluid and open and<br>spacious<br>has made made it possible for other<br>things to happen<br>um and I that wouldn't have been<br>possible without the burns you know<br>because the thing about the burns is<br>uh it's not like writing and having a<br>job where if you sit down for half a day<br>it's your one half day or it's your one<br>day that you've got and you sit down and<br>and and nothing happens<br>and you're not out seeing friends you're<br>not earning money<br>um<br>you know it's a different it's quite<br>that can be<br>you know writers in the audience will<br>know that it can be really tough that<br>to have a day where you get nothing you<br>know I mean you can see it<br>philosophically and think okay well this<br>is this is part of it but<br>um<br>so the great thing about the burns is it<br>takes<br>it loosens everything up yeah<br>yeah if I could just touch on that for a<br>moment<br>um the as I understand the fellowships<br>all of the fellowships there's no um<br>compulsion there's not compulsory that<br>you actually<br>there's no compulsion I don't think for<br>any of you to actually create anything<br>during your residency so if um is that<br>is that a freedom or an impediment for<br>you as creators you've got this year or<br>half year to be the fellow and you're<br>encouraged to just be creative<br>I think there's a huge pressure<br>personally like when you receive this<br>sort of opportunity it wouldn't matter<br>if I had to make the show or not you<br>kind of<br>um well I mean you're just excited right<br>I mean you have time to work in a way<br>you don't usually have and<br>do you mean more about like the pressure<br>you put on yourself yeah I suppose yeah<br>yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>and hopefully that's a positive pressure<br>yeah it's not always but most of the<br>time<br>but actually I think it would be a<br>you wouldn't be invited back<br>yeah<br>um<br>have I lived in nobody else does anybody<br>want to say anything about it if I asked<br>you about no I haven't asked you am I<br>about have your um about who you're<br>writing for you've already touched on it<br>you're running on this little 10 year<br>old boy yeah does that 10 year old<br>sometimes ignore you sometimes what<br>annoy you annoy me or do they take is it<br>all consuming or is there is there not<br>room for some other little person as<br>well<br>to be service I don't really write for a<br>10 year old I just made that up too<br>I no I actually a really interesting<br>listening to the others talking about<br>this I mean of course you're writing for<br>yourself in a way<br>you know I want to be immortal of course<br>um<br>you know and I love the best moment of<br>all is when that book arrives in the<br>mailbox for the first time that you've<br>had a book published<br>but yeah but then you yeah I'm also<br>aware of the audience too and writers<br>don't get a lot of feedback contrary to<br>what you might think but the people that<br>do bother to send you a letter the child<br>that sends you the letter is the one<br>that is because of your book I love<br>honeybees and I'm going to become a<br>beekeeper or whatever and you think yes<br>and that's a really amazing feeling yeah<br>it doesn't happen now<br>me<br>do you all know when it's finished when<br>do you know when it's time to put down<br>your PIN or your well whatever it is<br>you're working with<br>um when is it when is the work done<br>because I know people who often tinker<br>and keep tinkering and keep tinkering<br>and it's never complete<br>is that a is that a discipline that you<br>just have to say there we are I'm done<br>this is as this is as good as it's going<br>to get but for me I find I reach a point<br>where I'm exhausted with the material<br>it's probably more dictated by the<br>length of time that I'm actually working<br>on it rather than the duration of the<br>actual piece<br>um often it's imposed by external things<br>yeah<br>yeah yeah um yeah<br>and while we were talking about before<br>attention spans as well seems to<br>have an influence growing influence<br>that's what we were talking about can<br>you expand this a little bit what do you<br>mean by attention spans as far as a<br>Creator is concerned that you've got to<br>be mindful of uh of what you mean we<br>were sort of wandering amongst<br>the group<br>there's a diminishing of<br>the human attention span through our<br>interaction with media now<br>um<br>was there a conclusion why not the<br>conclusion being that that as a in your<br>case I guess you have got to be finite<br>in the link the duration of a piece<br>otherwise people are going to<br>stop listening<br>yeah well<br>maybe I'm a bit subversive in a way but<br>I would like to kick back again<br>something like that is it sort of<br>reclaim<br>um some space where people can actually<br>listen so we're so saturated with<br>information and sound<br>um<br>so often I'm<br>with um<br>small<br>um<br>bits of musical information<br>um<br>so yeah it's yeah it's difficult I guess<br>in your case uh move on in a moment<br>because you're working and what was the<br>word you used Sonic that's a nice word<br>Sonic Arts which is involves other<br>people performing and therefore other<br>audiences listening do you you have the<br>luxury maybe which maybe others don't<br>have of reworking it if needs be<br>okay so you can Tinker a little bit<br>after you've supposedly finished after<br>the first performance and so on can't<br>you yeah so I often revisit things that<br>I'm not feeling satisfied with<br>and<br>unfortunately every space where<br>something is is presented offers a new<br>challenge so I've I do change things at<br>the last minute<br>um<br>if you're working in a dry acoustic<br>Brienne you can't do that can you know<br>when it's published no one is published<br>let's just rework that last word there<br>yeah<br>yeah so I think<br>just that thing about writing for myself<br>first you know that that sort of changes<br>as the evolution of the work goes along<br>which is sort of the evolution to the<br>final thing you know so then<br>um<br>I've got a couple of people in my life<br>who are first readers or you know for<br>work so who I trust and um so feedback<br>it helps evolve the work that's part of<br>a process in fact yeah and the fact that<br>in that way I was thinking about that<br>um so much work is indirectly if not<br>directly collaborative in a way you know<br>I mean it's not that people who read<br>work and give comments are kind of<br>library but even sending a work to a<br>publisher then having someone else read<br>it it's being sent out for to readers<br>and and along the way there are small<br>changes being made<br>um but which you know you can as author<br>I can say no I don't I don't want to do<br>that but<br>but yeah it is interesting in that like<br>the the writer the poet to a final book<br>is quite a and then even the book<br>getting out to the world I mean you know<br>the whole thing as<br>a lot of other people yeah yeah that's<br>true for me as well like uh because if<br>you're creating a piece you're dealing<br>with humans and you want them to<br>own what they're performing so you you<br>you you have to well I find that it's<br>useful to have the um to let go of the<br>perfectionist mentality in order to just<br>let your peace go out into the world and<br>like a child you know just trust that<br>it's going to get out there and it's<br>going to be okay and you know it will<br>interact with people watching and and uh<br>it's<br>um and also as a respect for the the<br>performer because if you keep tinkering<br>with it they're always trying to get on<br>top of what it is that you're giving<br>them you know and then they'll<br>potentially lose their Mastery if they<br>if they're overloaded with changes or<br>possibilities so because you because<br>your instruments are dancers you you<br>you've got to be respectful of them in<br>that process but yeah<br>but uh can I just answer another<br>question which was about<br>um do you make work uh do you keep your<br>audience in mind uh I I had a thought<br>with that regarding<br>um the projects that I'm I'm doing that<br>absolutely it's a my audience are the<br>other people that are undertaking the<br>movement Explorations that I think uh<br>that I've kind of<br>used my whole Archive of movement<br>history and study of movement that I<br>think will enhance their well-being so<br>it's 100 percent uh revolving around the<br>the people that are coming as a as a as<br>a thing yeah so that process um for you<br>as a as a choreographer choreographer<br>um you've created it it's then actually<br>owned by the performers the dancers and<br>maybe then the audience and then it's<br>gone<br>how does that feel you know that it's<br>actually disappeared now it's and with<br>music too that it's that it's very much<br>based in time and then it's then there's<br>nothing left of it whereas with a writer<br>and with a visual artist it actually<br>will live will live forever that's a<br>nice question I think um<br>uh there is a lineage of<br>um dance as an experiences of dancers<br>that become embodied through the<br>interaction of watching a piece so the<br>piece itself may die but the um the<br>memory of it and how it inspired you to<br>move or to change the way that you move<br>and then if you become a teacher<br>yourself you can't help but embody all<br>of your influences and then you pass<br>that on so that there's a there is a<br>life beyond that but the other side of<br>that is I do feel sad because especially<br>in New Zealand the artistic scene is<br>difficult for choreographers so much<br>work that's generated is here in the<br>flesh and gone tomorrow and you know<br>some great things that I'm just sad that<br>not more people could see it or that<br>there's a happening in in other<br>countries where they have retrospectives<br>and well it's been retrospectives here<br>too but they revive earlier work<br>and all a piece just has a long long<br>life like I mean if you think about the<br>peanut Bausch company some of those<br>pieces are you know and uh it's sad that<br>that's not possible in this context yeah<br>yeah<br>um earlier we were all talking about<br>um about<br>um fashion and Raymond just mentioned it<br>before about the popularity of certain<br>sort of subject matters<br>um we were discussing about whether<br>whether<br>um<br>any of your work<br>um<br>um sort of goes out of date or out of<br>favor or out of style<br>and whether that's a frustration or you<br>that you have the confidence that that<br>will come that it's cyclical and your<br>works<br>will live longer than the fashion or the<br>time<br>I wonder how easy that is to judge in a<br>lifetime in your own lifetime yeah it's<br>a retrospective isn't it I guess yeah<br>yeah<br>I did have a casual conversation with a<br>friend recently that<br>work looked okay again after about five<br>years but I don't know<br>might might need to be longer than that<br>I think it would need to be a little bit<br>I mean and and in children's literature<br>it's it's changing all the while isn't<br>it and does that mean that something<br>that you write wrote<br>um five or six years ago is now no<br>longer popular<br>or um well or good anymore certainly out<br>I mean I wonder how much this is really<br>an artist's concern to be honest because<br>I think that what compels you to make is<br>the present and<br>um<br>it can be useful to go back to Old work<br>and to obviously there's always a thread<br>that's flowing through but<br>I don't know I I feel that<br>um<br>if you started to think about that or<br>worry about how your work would be when<br>it went out of fashion for example that<br>would just be the worst space to get<br>into so yeah I kind of think I I try not<br>to think about I try not to think about<br>that but then on the other hand there<br>could be a time when you look back at<br>your own stuff and say I wish I didn't<br>put that out then because my journey has<br>become so much better now than it was<br>then and I mean I know of composers who<br>will destroy earlier works because they<br>don't want people to hear it anymore<br>because they've moved to a different<br>place in what they were doing earlier<br>they now no longer wish to share with<br>what am I meant to say to that<br>I don't know probably probably it does<br>seem and it does seem unconstructive<br>yeah I think it's like living a life<br>with regret you know like you would<br>you the decisions that that you make<br>whether they're artistic decisions or<br>life decisions you have to remember your<br>thought processes at the time that led<br>you to those conclusions and it's the<br>same with the for me it's the same with<br>looking at my earlier work I'm like well<br>I wouldn't make that now but I<br>understand the site guys that that was<br>made in and how it reflects that and it<br>may or may not be relevant now or it may<br>not take more time for it to become<br>irrelevant you know so and I think also<br>it might perhaps the worry is that it<br>seems this resolved but that's often<br>most interesting for an audience you<br>know so I think you have to just you<br>have to let go of that yeah and I feel<br>like an artwork is precious so it's you<br>know like even though the the person who<br>made it no longer has an appreciation<br>for it it's kind of sad to censor that<br>you know like if in the case of this<br>composer you know to take it away and<br>also I guess if you thinking of the<br>library of dance like if you go back or<br>you know or you can see things there's<br>things that you can find useful these<br>might be out of date but there's things<br>that you<br>you know so I I think that's true for<br>definitely true for writing well<br>um<br>writers supposedly go out of date but<br>um<br>people go back and read them and<br>always finding some other approach or<br>some something else<br>you know and this is something in that<br>history a lot of women around writers<br>who were never in date<br>you know<br>um<br>have only had their moment after their<br>deaths<br>you know so imagine if the amateur they<br>spent their whole life thinking I've got<br>to get rid of that yeah no idea exactly<br>I mean it would be a disaster yeah and<br>there is a sort of an asynchronous<br>thing<br>play in history and time and style and<br>stuff you know you can't things rub up<br>against each other in ways you don't<br>you know you can't know or<br>predict or yeah you know<br>yeah and this is what the academy does<br>well you know fossicks around<br>yeah so I guess that it it shows that<br>you've got to either you as artists are<br>working now and it's just part of the<br>part of the fabric that you know can't<br>be too precious about<br>um whether it's whether it's going to be<br>liked today or not tomorrow you just do<br>it and see what happens<br>um maybe<br>I'm going to open to the floor I think<br>now and Linda has got a microphone<br>to which she is going to wander around<br>if anybody would like to ask any of the<br>fellows a question there's a hand there<br>thank you very much I'd just like to<br>pick up on the where the discussion kind<br>of finished there in talking about<br>censorship of work gone by<br>how do you respond to<br>the kind of movement that is around some<br>of the attitudes perhaps around gender<br>or race whereby works that have gone<br>before are<br>which might reflect attitudes that are<br>kind of objectionable or even apparent<br>now are are so out of fashion that<br>they're censored out of existence or we<br>are no longer allowed to engage with<br>them and we can't actually reflect on<br>the time and the place in which they<br>were created<br>when I when I think think back to the<br>tendon books I read as a child he's the<br>main character was a you know a<br>middle-aged alcoholic people got shot<br>um you know it was totally what would<br>never get published now<br>but in those books and the early ones<br>especially the racial<br>um stereotypes were shocking<br>and those books like Tintin and the<br>Congo for example just were out of print<br>for a long long time but then thankfully<br>they were reprinted recently in the last<br>decade or so but with it you know a note<br>in the front saying you know these are<br>this reflects the colonialist attitudes<br>of of Belgium or whatever it was I think<br>in those days and I think that's you<br>know to censor them as crazy or to sense<br>a Little House on the Prairie because of<br>some attitudes like that I think you<br>know you need to<br>to let children know well this is what<br>it was like back then<br>it's why this is horrendous stereotype<br>yes thank you<br>because<br>um did I not hear recently that a statue<br>in some Central yes I know it was<br>Stephen Foster the American composer<br>folk composer who's stepped the statue<br>of him in his hometown he's been dead<br>for a hundred years has been removed<br>because his inspiration was the music of<br>the African-American and there's the<br>statue is of him standing there in the<br>center of town and sitting down at his<br>what<br>offensive offensive to some people to<br>some people yeah<br>well Burns himself got caught up in that<br>didn't you tell us retelling obvious<br>reputation was well there was something<br>about the metoo campaign and reassessing<br>I don't know enough about Burns<br>biography to come into it really but<br>something about how it<br>um<br>just how he was with women and um<br>whether we should hold him in such high<br>regard so<br>it's often better not to know too much<br>doesn't it well I don't but you know<br>like is it you know as is the work<br>separate from the person if that's<br>really what's at stake<br>and there's a novel separate from its<br>context yeah and I think yeah<br>those things need to be acknowledged<br>they shouldn't be banned but they need<br>to be acknowledged<br>yeah good point yeah acknowledged not<br>bad<br>another question from the floor<br>I think I'm brave enough to ask it<br>um<br>uh what impresses me is that you're<br>expressing yourself you're opening<br>yourselves up so much to people why the<br>expression of your art how do you cope<br>with criticism<br>do you take your book critics<br>uh happily<br>actually do you ignore them I well<br>actually I find most book reviews of my<br>books that I've had have been<br>uh<br>not so you know critical as in you know<br>they're not analyzing enough<br>and the best one I had was the only one<br>that was really<br>picked apart my first novel and it was<br>by a 13 year old and I think this is<br>great this is what I really want to hear<br>and from the audience I really wanted to<br>hear it from too and it was my first<br>novel and it did have things that were<br>you know I'm sort of looking back on I<br>think years later really should have<br>improved it so yeah really good<br>criticism is just fantastic<br>too late yeah well that was my question<br>earlier wasn't it do you look back at<br>some of your work and think oh I should<br>have done that differently oh yeah but<br>that's inevitable that's inevitable yeah<br>I think that's an important point is<br>that um it's an art in itself the art of<br>critique so some people are able to<br>deliver that critique in a in a critique<br>sandwich positive negative positive yeah<br>and then as palatable to the human yeah<br>and uh and others are not and and I feel<br>often in the case of dance that the the<br>level of discourse in the in the reviews<br>which could be you know really<br>um constructively critical uh it doesn't<br>often get to that point it sits more at<br>the level of opinion and I don't think<br>I could tell a bad joke here actually<br>one of my choreographers that I worked<br>for he said that opinions are like<br> everybody has one you know like<br>so I mean like you know like that's not<br>so important it's the it is the<br>criticality and the degree of argument<br>and and then it can be like like um<br>Raymond was saying is that then it can<br>be something that can be really useful<br>in some reviews you just don't you just<br>don't get them at all I go to one review<br>for shift which had um<br>you know it follows it's a relationship<br>between two women for a good part of<br>that<br>and<br>um there was a guy reviewing it and he<br>said oh well he basically said well<br>I no I don't understand anything about<br>relationship Woman to Woman<br>so that whole bit like he couldn't get<br>us it was shutting off so it was like oh<br>yes<br>uh<br>it's a different kind of love or<br>something it's a it's not you know it's<br>just<br>yeah<br>it's still human<br>yes yeah yeah well exactly so it was<br>just um<br>when people come out so Dylan do you<br>have works of yours which are performed<br>and reviewed which then hurt or impact<br>then on how you might do something next<br>time<br>um<br>you know what you're saying that dance<br>reviews<br>um<br>there's music they it tends to be an<br>rather than sort of opinions<br>so it can be quite hard to get<br>any kind of critique positive or<br>negative from from there naturally<br>so oh well that's just a that's another<br>peer criticism is another thing<br>can be very influential I find<br>especially specially people you work so<br>closely with<br>and if they have<br>enough courage to<br>to mention something yes<br>yeah I think it's different for a<br>straight performer because a lot of them<br>will actually not read critics critiques<br>because it doesn't it can be<br>overwhelming yeah yeah<br>thank you for that question anyone else<br>um<br>really fascinated about the languages<br>that are across the Arts and uh in<br>reality<br>I don't my view is that you don't you<br>cannot control your audience I'm<br>interested how it's sort of tuned into<br>this because<br>um<br>people just like may it be of different<br>cultures but it will take its own life<br>once it leaves you to whoever interprets<br>it be it in time and place because it's<br>a moment of your time what I'm really<br>interested in is<br>um you talked about it there was since<br>the question about inspiration but I'm<br>interested in what any of you aspire to<br>actually leave traces of yourself for<br>the future and who those audiences might<br>be<br>sort of like your poetic DNA or<br>something<br>I'm I am a bit of a messenger writer and<br>my Whenever I send something off to a<br>publisher they sometimes comes back with<br>two messages<br>get rid of the message<br>uh yeah but you know that's kind of like<br>a lot of what my writing is all about<br>admittedly like I'm writing about trees<br>now and I'd really like to think that<br>people will fall in love with trees and<br>want to plant trees and see that trees<br>are going to save the planet<br>kind of it gets under an idea like that<br>gets into my head and takes hold and uh<br>I just can't stop it really and<br>you kind of convince yourself that this<br>is the this is the thing the salvation<br>of the planet rests on trees suddenly<br>you know a couple of years ago it was<br>bees<br>and that is your sense of you mentioned<br>the word before your immortality is that<br>is what you're going to leave behind<br>isn't it trees and bees yeah<br>yeah<br>I aspire to<br>um I hope that the joy and pleasure of<br>movement uh is something that I not<br>necessarily like my my legacy but a<br>legacy that I can encourage that and and<br>to go I would like to go beyond the<br>artistic um realm and encourage<br>all humans to move more and to to dance<br>more<br>um so that's that's what I'd like to do<br>even if it's like a tiny minuscule nudge<br>if you were writing in a really<br>repressive regime<br>how how are composing how would that<br>change if I'm thinking of the fact that<br>in East Germany and and so on us the<br>Arts had a huge<br>um impact because they're the only way<br>and which people could express<br>themselves<br>um have you thought about what it would<br>be like to to write and a really<br>repressive regime where it could be<br>dangerous<br>until you were in there<br>how do you know how as a character you<br>would be able to<br>behave be<br>let alone create a few words<br>really<br>so yeah I think it's quite hard to put<br>yourself in that<br>uh to see the courage and The Bravery of<br>writers who have continued to write<br>under that it's just yeah it's a too<br>scary it throws quite a bit into a leaf<br>that<br>Cambridge yeah so I think about<br>Shostakovich and the fact that Stalin<br>was breathing down his neck<br>through his life<br>and the<br>he was really controlled with<br>what he his effort could be<br>um<br>but<br>the sort of ingenious ways he he found<br>to put codes into into the music and<br>sort of found a personal<br>okay language despite the repression<br>um<br>he was Brave he was Brave wasn't it yeah<br>yeah so hard to imagine<br>had a I briefly studied<br>um 20th Century Polish art history and<br>you know which had an official art<br>program which was obvious interest to me<br>but what I did find really inspiring was<br>the way that people<br>found communities and networks around<br>that and you know some quite elegant and<br>um you know<br>great works were made just in people's<br>houses or<br>circulated<br>as you know on paper or<br>yeah some highly imaginative<br>you know really incredible work could<br>happen and I think it's quite<br>of course no one wants to live under<br>such a regime as you are suggesting but<br>I think it's the flip side is that<br>um<br>I guess people will somehow always will<br>continue to make work and Share work and<br>this actually what I what I what I<br>enjoyed taking from from that history<br>was the social value that I could have<br>so it wasn't<br>um it wasn't an economic unit at all and<br>it wasn't even<br>um a public one but it had this really<br>high value to the people who were<br>I remember uh being in a festival where<br>they were remarking that the interesting<br>work currently in dance is coming from<br>China and uh and but it's a you know a<br>high degree of censorship and<br>um and that that was an interesting<br>point because uh it comes back to that<br>um audition experience I had where they<br>just asked me to improvise in such an<br>open way and I found that difficult and<br>it that can also happen in the artistic<br>process where because there are such<br>strong limitations they can actually uh<br>limitations are really useful like uh in<br>in terms of defining your artistic<br>process so it's this strange blessing in<br>disguise but of course what a price to<br>pay for that<br>um you know potentially making your<br>artwork more interesting to a wider<br>audience because of those restrictions<br>that you have to maneuver in but then<br>you have to experience that regime so<br>yeah<br>thank you I just want to ask someone why<br>you chose to come to our amazing<br>there aren't that many programs in New<br>Zealand which can afford you at the time<br>it's about time and the privilege of<br>having<br>I mean I don't before now I didn't<br>really know Dunedin and so<br>yeah I've come to really<br>love what it can offer and the space<br>um the geography<br>and the weather is actually better than<br>I thought it would be<br>as well it's a pleasure I think that all<br>the<br>fellows here are here because of the<br>University of otago is the only one in<br>the country that has got so many and<br>coordinated so well<br>um<br>thank you<br>any more questions here's one down here<br>continuing the theme of the question<br>before<br>is 2018 a good time for you to be here<br>um I mean I know you're here now and um<br>you won't know but if we were here a few<br>years ago eight or nine years ago<br>do you feel that we're in a better space<br>now than for you doing what you're doing<br>than what it would have been<br>a few years previous<br>ly<br>I'm concerned that<br>um I'm building candy wounds here that<br>um well actually we're entering a<br>conservative a more conservative era so<br>politically so I don't globally so I<br>don't um<br>I don't quite know how to answer that<br>question because it's a bit hard to put<br>yourself back in time but maybe I'm<br>pleased to be doing it now rather than<br>in 2020 page<br>but I hope I don't live to agree with<br>that<br>for me it's a very melancholy experience<br>coming at this particular time because<br>the uh as I said I started in phys Ed<br>and that's where dance has been housed<br>and the Caroline plumber has been housed<br>and it's also where I started dancing<br>the the studios in there I'm shown a<br>Dunlop McTavish she ran classes there<br>and that's where I took them and this is<br>the last year that that studio will<br>exist and so it's like a homecoming and<br>that's where I started and I want to<br>come back and give to the community so<br>the timing in that sense is good but I'm<br>super sad about the state of dance<br>you know that it's not considered<br>important enough anymore that it's it's<br>you're gonna say something tonight<br>you see at the Joe Melancholy but I<br>understand what you're saying because<br>the the whole Humanities division is<br>a state of<br>I was just<br>yeah<br>speak sorry sorry I was just curious<br>about those sort of um the University of<br>otago's expectations regarding the<br>fellowships which she talked about at<br>the beginning and just about sort of the<br>University relying on the fellows to<br>challenge people and entertain us and<br>tell us who we are and I guess I was<br>thinking those seem quite big<br>expectations for one year and and I just<br>wondered generally as artists do you<br>feel well supported in New Zealand not<br>only in this year because this is<br>obviously a lucky year but do you feel<br>well supported to do your craft and I<br>mean supported financially and morally<br>by us as a people overall or do you<br>sometimes feel like checking it all in<br>and saying stuff is all find yourselves<br>I've always felt<br>lived in Dunedin all my life but I've<br>been a writer and Dunedin all my life<br>and<br>always felt really well supported<br>in Dunedin as a writer just whenever<br>there's events and things and and that's<br>been really great because you know and<br>you could be gloomy about the publishing<br>scene in New Zealand all the big<br>Publishers have gone offshore and you<br>know Left Behind one giant one in<br>Auckland which it doesn't it takes about<br>four novels a year I think and uh<br>you know and then there's children's<br>publishing which is even more difficult<br>I think but yeah but as far as local<br>support goes that's for me really<br>the important thing<br>I think you can have Community Support<br>like from friends who are writers and<br>you have that kind of support<br>um but earning a living as a coach has<br>yeah I mean I I had to go abroad to make<br>a living as a as a dancer really like to<br>to really live in a decent way so that<br>that was you know I mean it was good on<br>some levels for uh getting a huge wealth<br>of experience but that's also uh the<br>reality So and I've hybridized myself<br>which is you know like so that I can<br>earn a living and we were talking about<br>this in the and there was a I think<br>there was um<br>kind of a Jealousy on running both ways<br>because I I see the virtue of focusing<br>solely on your endeavors but then you<br>have to reconcile that with the reality<br>of the situation you're in to support<br>your family support yourself so you can<br>hybridize like I have but that does mean<br>that you sacrifice your your ability to<br>focus solely on one thing and it is hard<br>to be a renaissance human<br>I think there's a lot of growing<br>competition as well<br>um over funding<br>which is<br>actually quite a struggle I think<br>um<br>so you're you're fighting amongst your<br>colleagues for to make projects happen<br>actually underestimate new zealanders<br>new zealanders aren't afraid of having<br>New Zealand content but the<br>organizations<br>um<br>and really giving<br>enough exposure to New Zealand music I<br>think<br>and I guess yeah I guess I would say<br>that I think this is a I'm very thankful<br>for<br>your I feel I'm in a room where there's<br>a lot of support<br>um for what we do and what I do<br>but I would also love to see that that<br>feeling spread a little widely a bit<br>more widely in New Zealand as a society<br>I think we could do a lot more to Value<br>the Arts and<br>um<br>I think that just starts with probably<br>every single one of us you know just<br>getting along to something and<br>encouraging someone else to and yeah<br>participating in the programs that are<br>going on<br>thank you I think being a Renaissance<br>person has always been a challenge even<br>from the Renaissance onwards so nothing<br>new I think about the the challenges<br>that we face<br>um we do have a<br>government which has tried to turn the<br>tide of nine years of non-renaissance as<br>far as our sector of the world is<br>concerned which is to be celebrated and<br>one can feel gloomy about the demise of<br>performance spaces and their Theater<br>Company in the city but that's cyclical<br>as well I guess so we live in a lovely<br>little place at the bottom of the world<br>and we've got a lot to celebrate anyone<br>not speak I'm not lecturing here I just<br>want to say thank you all for coming I'd<br>like to thank<br>Professor Tony Balentine from the<br>University<br>Linda Cullen and Johnny Chapman from at<br>the dpag<br>you all for coming and for the fellows<br>for giving us their time and a little<br>bit of insight today into how it all<br>works<br>and I'd like you all to join us now with<br>for afternoon tea but before you go I've<br>got a wee plug for myself if I may<br>um Arts Festival Deneen launched its<br>program for this year last week I've got<br>a whole lot of brochures here some of<br>you may already have those<br>um Fest was on on the 21st to the 30th<br>of September this year<br>use it or lose it thank you all very<br>much<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
