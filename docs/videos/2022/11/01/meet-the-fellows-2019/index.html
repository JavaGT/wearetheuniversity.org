well over 10 years so that's pretty<br>amazing<br>um and Nicholas has been convener for<br>every single one except one when he was<br>overseas uh so so he's well versed in<br>the kinds of things that our fellows<br>and he will also introduce the panel but<br>first of all I'd just like to say before<br>handing you over to the girls that it's<br>an auspicious year because it's the<br>University's 150th birthday and I I want<br>to acknowledge too that the gallery has<br>benefited greatly from various<br>collaborations<br>with Humanities and Sciences uh<br>particularly with events and which is my<br>area from the University so happy<br>birthday from the gallery to the<br>university and I'm now going to hand you<br>over to Nicholas to introduce the<br>fellows<br>thank you Linda um I'll do that is it<br>okay can you hear<br>anyway uh thank you all for coming the<br>Forum today is<br>um<br>an opportunity for us to hear about the<br>creative process and the journey that<br>the fellows are on<br>um I'd like to say also that it's not a<br>show and tell so that we know<br>performance aspect from anybody this<br>afternoon if you want that you'll need<br>to keep your eye out for other<br>activities during the year<br>um<br>so if you can't hear just give us a<br>shout and we can turn things up or we'll<br>move closer to our machines our<br>microphones<br>um the University of otago fellowships<br>have been in existence for over 50 years<br>some of them<br>and are a huge testimony to the<br>University of otago's commitment to the<br>creative process<br>um the front page of the website for the<br>fellows quote Charles brash<br>from a article that he wrote in landfall<br>magazine in 1959 which said<br>part of the University's proper business<br>is to act as a nurse to the Arts<br>more exactly to the imagination<br>as it is as it expresses itself in the<br>Arts and Sciences<br>imagination May flourish anywhere<br>but it should flourish as a matter of<br>course in the university for it is only<br>through imaginative thinking that<br>Society grows<br>this afternoon we would are going to<br>hear how the current fellows uh<br>heading to that<br>intellectual and material<br>body of thinking<br>and I think that with the the ever sort<br>of Shifting Focus that is the 21st<br>century and at the University of otago<br>these fellowships remain a Beacon of<br>Hope<br>and let's hope that they continue for a<br>long time to come for another 50 years<br>and more and as Linda said I think it's<br>it's appropriate to<br>um salute and celebrate the University<br>of otago for daring to be wise I think<br>that's the motto motto of the University<br>of Idaho in its 150th years<br>so let's get on I'd like to introduce<br>the fellows to you<br>um on your right we have Imogen Taylor<br>who is the Francis Hodgkin's fellow<br>we have Dylan lardelli who is the Mozart<br>fellow<br>we have Antonio<br>cebuma who is the Caroline plumber<br>fellow<br>what about that right yes it's good<br>and then we've got Fifi Colston who is<br>the University of otago College of<br>Education creative New Zealand children<br>writer in Residence hello<br>and then we have Emily Duncan who is the<br>burn star<br>there we are one two three four five uh<br>and we are the University of otago is<br>the only University in the country that<br>has<br>sound up a little<br>it's just a little<br>so if everybody needs to talk a little<br>bit more move forward a little okay<br>so what I want to do to start with is<br>I'm going to ask each of the fellows in<br>whatever order they wish it could be up<br>and down whoever whoever wants to go<br>first to tell us a little bit about<br>um your career to date<br>and um and your journey as an artist<br>so<br>writers talk too much oh okay uh well<br>Journey<br>maybe I could talk about when I applied<br>for the fellowship so I applied uh the<br>year before so what have I been 26<br>2017 for 2018.<br>um and I got one of those rather lovely<br>rejection letters that I'm sure we're<br>all very familiar with but you get every<br>once in a while as opposed to the<br>standard<br>um rejection letter some every now and<br>again there's a little note added such<br>as it was along the lines of um please<br>do try again we you know<br>we liked your application<br>and then most of you will be familiar<br>with what happened to the beginning of<br>May last year and I had I think three<br>different projects on the go at the<br>fortune at various stages when it closed<br>so I was in a bit of a funk it would be<br>fair to say and I think I wasn't even<br>really sure how to communicate the value<br>of what<br>I do when it can be so easily crossed<br>off a ledger to put it um bluntly but I<br>kept my own butt to put it blankly and<br>um<br>puts the application in so yeah pick<br>yourself up<br>I'll go next because I'm right there<br>um I've got a a minion varied career and<br>I started off at design school in<br>Wellington I was a commercial artist for<br>a very long time I've always loved<br>Reading Writing drawing and making<br>things<br>and so<br>um over the over the years I've I've<br>been on television making things I've<br>been writing things and getting them<br>published I'm largely my Publisher's<br>Scholastic and uh illustrating books and<br>being very highly involved in the world<br>of wearable Arts doing um costuming and<br>then laterally for props for films and<br>web series and that sort of thing so I<br>applied under a bit of a three-pronged<br>thing while I'm the children's writer in<br>Residence but the longest title in the<br>world by the way<br>um it is<br>um I've come as a writer illustrator and<br>costume maker and my project uh involves<br>all three strands so I haven't done a<br>lot of costume making while I've been<br>down here because I haven't got my my<br>industrial sewing machine and what have<br>you but I'm certainly doing the other<br>things<br>um thank you so much everyone for coming<br>I'll give a brief of uh kind of there<br>I would say the headlines in my career<br>um first I started off in church mainly<br>uh that's when I realized I could I<br>could you know be on stage or teach or<br>choreograph then uh from church I<br>expanded to engaging in different Talent<br>shots and from there I connected with a<br>group of friends of mine and we started<br>a project called breakdowns project<br>Uganda that uh attracts a lot of young<br>people from different walks of life that<br>have a disadvantaged background to you<br>know be part of an experience a Dance<br>Experience and you know Forge a life out<br>of that then from there I uh formed the<br>project called quanda Productions with<br>colleagues of mine from Germany and<br>Zimbabwe and it's about like a different<br>artists from different parts of the<br>world collaborating on eye level you<br>know because the projects that we're a<br>part of before was more of like Europe<br>was always the one giving Africa so<br>we're like how come yeah how you know<br>how can we have a platform that is kind<br>of like a tour street that you know you<br>give and take and the same thing gather<br>around then uh I also started a project<br>called as to hearts and that one is<br>mainly based on uh focused on breaking<br>stereotypes especially uh in the western<br>world if I can call it that and uh we<br>basically go in schools especially in<br>Europe German Netherlands uh engaging<br>with different young people like dancing<br>with them eating with them doing art<br>with them and every Friday we do a big<br>exhibition invite a lot of parents and<br>pretty much the core ideas to like<br>interact with them and give them that<br>first-hand experience of being with a<br>some guy from Uganda and you know<br>um anyway if you cut the whole story<br>short uh I got the opportunity to be a<br>pin about fellow in 2017 so when I was<br>giving a presentation in Wellington uh<br>coordinator told me about the Carolina<br>plumber fellow and when I read the uh<br>the you know the requirements and<br>everything that Caroline believes dance<br>can be I resonated so much with<br>everything so I was like all right why<br>not give it a try so I applied<br>unfortunately I got it and now I'm here<br>thank you<br>thank you okay<br>uh so I can go back a little bit further<br>maybe<br>um I came to music quite late in life I<br>remember<br>I was about 16 or 17 so through high<br>school I<br>um became interested interested in in<br>playing music<br>um<br>and then happened to enroll in<br>University as a performer and it didn't<br>really cross my mind that I could<br>actually be someone that also writes<br>music<br>um so I<br>did also do a composition degree and<br>um looking back at it<br>as far as I can remember back I was<br>always moved by music and<br>I can remember sort of trying out<br>different things on instruments that we<br>had at home<br>um I was quite fortunate the the<br>teachers in Wellington<br>um sort of enlarged<br>my whole world really and<br>especially Jake body<br>um who had an interest in the music<br>particularly in our region and in Asia<br>so I was able to to travel to Asia a lot<br>and that's become<br>um the core part of what I do now I work<br>a lot in in China and Japan<br>um and through that<br>I was also able to add in Europe<br>and so I went to Germany and Switzerland<br>to study for my Master's Degree<br>and I was in Europe for a while<br>um well quite a while really<br>um<br>studying also performing writing for<br>numerous ensembles<br>um before that I was in New Zealand and<br>I'd kind of got to the end of the list<br>of writing for<br>like the orchestras and chamber groups<br>here<br>um<br>and<br>it felt like the right time in the last<br>few years to to return to New Zealand<br>and<br>hi I'm Emma Jen thanks for coming down<br>there's lots of familiar faces which is<br>really nice<br>um<br>I'm a painter and I decided that I<br>wanted to be one when I was about five<br>um<br>I'm originally from Colorado Russell in<br>the Bay of islands but I've lived mostly<br>in Auckland I studied at Elam of Fine<br>Arts and graduated in 2010 and have been<br>exhibiting since then<br>with the gallery in Auckland called<br>Michael lept and with public<br>institutions<br>um this is the second residency I've had<br>the first was the Colin McCann house<br>residency into sarangi<br>um which was only three months uh this<br>is a real treat having it for a year<br>um and yeah this is probably the busiest<br>year of my career so far so<br>yeah I'm really at the beginning<br>probably yeah<br>good well let's keep it busy<br>um I'd like to ask you all now to share<br>with us some a little bit to give us an<br>insight into what your creative process<br>is<br>um uh what sort of methods you use where<br>you get your inspiration<br>um you know the empty canvas scenario<br>how do you start what do you do how does<br>it all come together<br>just<br>um<br>the challenge with that question is that<br>uh sometimes I'm a choreographer<br>sometimes I'm a teacher sometimes I'm a<br>project manager so I I think the best<br>way to respond to it is in this context<br>as a community artist<br>uh<br>uh first of all my classes are based on<br>the idea that you know allow people the<br>freedom of expression and<br>through that<br>you know they so that they can best<br>version of themselves rather than<br>becoming the exact duplicate of the<br>teacher so in that sense uh when I'm<br>teaching movements I see it as a formula<br>so I give people movements as formulas<br>but then I encourage them to you know do<br>their own multiplication and subtraction<br>so if you can go higher than me then<br>you're allowed to and you can go lower<br>than you you're allowed to so yeah<br>pretty much you know giving that uh that<br>safe space that people can push<br>themselves as much as possible so yeah<br>my creative process would be in that<br>sense really coming up with movements<br>that<br>allow such such a thing therefore like<br>focusing on how someone feels than how<br>they do it you know and yeah<br>so is that um is that sort of nervous<br>sometimes because it sounds to me as if<br>you are actually relying on the creative<br>response from your class<br>um so you've got to lead or end Inspire<br>but it's what's going to come out of it<br>you actually don't quite know before you<br>start yeah uh the reason why<br>I will rely on their rest on the<br>people's response or self-pushing is<br>because<br>uh the idea is everyone has a different<br>reason why they're there that's why it's<br>uh uh kind of a community bridging<br>Bridges uh kind of a project so some<br>people might be there for fitness and<br>some people might be there because you<br>know they had a bad day and just want to<br>be somewhere so you're not gonna you<br>know force them to give the same energy<br>someone who wants to work out and<br>someone who just wants to you know let<br>me just forget about how terrible that<br>there was so so in that sense like you<br>you know you give like tips and<br>different uh uh yeah formula I will keep<br>saying formula but uh and then from that<br>you realize that uh<br>people tap into the core<br>idea of why they're there and why they<br>want to be there and then yeah from that<br>they push themselves as much as possible<br>yeah<br>of it<br>Dylan<br>yep your process inspiration methods do<br>you work with it is it paper or do you<br>work on it<br>and when people ask this question it<br>makes me realize how<br>diminished the vocabulary around<br>Sounders compared to to seeing<br>um<br>um<br>we have to use this word observation<br>but oral observation for me in taking in<br>oral environments and<br>um so unpicking what they're made of<br>um let's<br>something that I'm quite<br>um inspired by<br>um<br>and like somehow constructing sound<br>environments and<br>men material around that that can grow<br>into into the shape of a piece of music<br>um<br>I'm also quite interested in<br>um is it the instruments we have that<br>play music uh<br>tools that have developed some some of<br>these things over hundreds of years<br>as expressive tools to as vehicles for<br>interpretation it will sound so I<br>uh I'm really fascinated with<br>these instruments objects<br>sort of holistically<br>I can work with their nature to<br>uncover<br>um sort of further sound potential<br>and<br>that also<br>enables me to construct<br>music around that as well<br>so if for example I think this is<br>probably true you are commissioned by<br>NZ Trio yes yep yeah so Indian Trio<br>called you and says can you please write<br>us a piece so that'll be presumably for<br>them that's violin<br>the cello and piano right yeah so what<br>do you do what how do you how do you<br>start how do you<br>how do you do it<br>yeah<br>I think it's<br>it's really vital to have<br>to know the context of<br>um<br>a group like that so Piano Trio it's not<br>quite like the string quartet which has<br>a much richer denser tradition<br>um Piano Trio<br>so the history of<br>music so it Rose around the time of<br>Haydn he was working in Hungary<br>um<br>so I do delve into the repertoire<br>um not as examples to follow but more of<br>not what to follow<br>um<br>and<br>also recently remember to a recent<br>am quite interested if there's a small<br>number of people three or four in how<br>they're constructed how they interact<br>with each other<br>is one instrument which is very dominant<br>being the piano<br>um<br>against two much more I think more<br>intimate<br>then homogeneous<br>instruments so I I do sort of think of<br>these these formations and that sort of<br>the practicalities of<br>perhaps finding a new way to<br>to reformat that<br>do use a pen and paper or a computer I<br>mean or you use a keyboard when you're<br>actually<br>um<br>creating the work<br>ideally from my mind through an<br>instrument I actually I have a number of<br>instruments that I I call about<br>um onto a piece of paper and then into a<br>machine because<br>thank you Imogen<br>everybody's got it yeah yeah<br>um<br>yeah it's a huge question in painting<br>um how do you start a painting where is<br>it coming from I'm not a believer in<br>thinking that and you're waiting for<br>inspiration to pop into your head and<br>then make something from that I think<br>in my practice it's hard work and it's<br>practice and it's drawing and it's<br>painting all day every day<br>but I'm also really interested in the<br>kind of politics around starting a blank<br>canvas and what do you do and what what<br>that decision decision making process<br>can be what the parameters are and<br>um<br>yeah and and I'm interested in uh<br>particularly uh the decisions that women<br>make as artists and<br>um<br>and their their practices being kind of<br>reflected or through Sean through my<br>practice<br>so I look at a lot of art history as<br>well<br>um I look at images a lot I'm yeah<br>ferrising around for practices that have<br>not been<br>um had the recognition that they needed<br>to have<br>um<br>but yeah I think uh discipline and<br>uh mixed with intuition and arbitrary<br>decision making and<br>all of that but mostly Trust<br>I think trust in yourself yeah<br>fantastic<br>Emily<br>I'll just jumping down the other table<br>why not um can you tell us about your<br>creative process your inspiration method<br>for those of you who don't know me I'm<br>primarily a playwright<br>um I often begin with a question<br>uh<br>usually in a sort of ethical question<br>and it's a nice way to think about maybe<br>framing a play because I don't want to<br>give an audience all the answers I want<br>them to go away<br>questioning<br>the work themselves maybe what happens<br>to the characters<br>um I can say to other playwrights that I<br>maybe Mentor I'm the worst feeling you<br>want to leave an audience with is just<br>disinterest they don't it's almost worse<br>it's very bruising but if they don't<br>like the work at least they've had some<br>reaction but if it's I know I feel it if<br>I go to a play and I just think I don't<br>care that's the worst<br>um<br>yeah and uh and maybe talks specifically<br>about uh a play I'd been working<br>on script is now done<br>um about Ethel Benjamin and Emily<br>cederberg<br>and<br>so part of my Approach with that it's an<br>historical fiction so there was um I did<br>a lot of research at the start but there<br>is a point and um this could be a good<br>procrastination uh trick where you have<br>to actually push that history aside and<br>say right where's the drama<br>because drama has certain ingredients<br>such as conflict<br>um and I also say if if you can read it<br>on Wikipedia that's not your play there<br>are things we know about Ethel Benjamin<br>and Emily cederberg that you don't need<br>to buy a theater ticket to go and um<br>see we know about their successes so<br>that was not my my play I you know often<br>like to delve into the the liminal or<br>the darker spaces<br>um yeah and also thinking about<br>historical based works I've done it's<br>probably maybe some parallels with your<br>thinking Imogen what are those areas<br>that get overlooked that don't end up in<br>the official records so to speak<br>yeah<br>um Imogen mentioned a moment ago about a<br>female perspective to her work<br>oh yeah uh we'll talk afterwards<br>um<br>it's maybe conscious in a sense<br>that I will alert to<br>those stories that don't necessarily get<br>told<br>as opposed to<br>I mean I<br>practice my work as I practice<br>discipline you do it you figure out a<br>lot just in the act of writing and<br>sometimes you that switch off your<br>analytical brain I'm I'm working on a<br>very different project at the moment and<br>I've sort of set myself a task for the<br>end of August<br>I'm not letting myself think too much<br>about the workers just get it down get<br>it down and<br>um I don't work like that all the time a<br>few months from now it'll be very<br>intense<br>editing but uh so what was I coming back<br>to oh yes so different ways of<br>practicing but in terms of myself when<br>I'm looking at the stories I want to<br>tell<br>yeah they're quite often related to one<br>of those ones have been overlocked<br>especially me as a woman<br>yeah I'm alert to that okay<br>Fifi<br>create a process inspiration methodology<br>how do you do it<br>um well it depends what you're talking<br>about<br>whether it's illustration writing or<br>wearable art but actually it probably<br>all comes from the same place so I think<br>if you looked up my Google searches I'm<br>really worried about otago University<br>really she wants to know how to kill a<br>dog<br>um and um I don't actually want to kill<br>a dog but the dog does die and and uh<br>yeah so there's there's if you are if<br>you're illustrating a book it's already<br>been written whether I've written it or<br>I'm illustrating somebody else's book so<br>you've got a story and you're that's<br>that's got to be published so you know<br>it's you're gonna get paid somehow so<br>that's good and uh so then it's a matter<br>of looking at how you're going to<br>um bring add something to the text<br>whether it's your own text or somebody<br>else's text and and bring out their<br>other those other visual elements that<br>will guide for children's books or guide<br>a child to throw a story in a completely<br>wonderful way you hope and and you hope<br>that you're going to draw the hands<br>right you know not they're not going to<br>let that punches bananas so there's lots<br>of drawing and redrawing when you're<br>when you're illustrating but<br>um but you know I go through the same<br>process but with and I'll talk about<br>wearable art really because it's it's<br>the same thing I'm coming up with the<br>story wearable art is not about a uh the<br>prettiest dress you ever did see made<br>out of 50 000 bottle tops that's not<br>certainly not of what it is for me and<br>we've moved on in that area so um it's<br>about telling a story and saying what<br>you want to say and then and then the<br>the artwork is the vehicle for it so<br>writing is the same thing so<br>right now I am um<br>uh there's a couple of things that I've<br>just dagger a diary that I buried in the<br>Robert Lord Cottage Garden at the start<br>of our our residence in my residency<br>because we're staying in Robert law<br>Cottage and it needed to look very<br>um it needed to look discarded forgotten<br>and rotting and I dug it up two days ago<br>and it looks fantastic it's covered in<br>leaf litter and it's got mold<br>something's burrowed through it I'm<br>going to be um photographing that that's<br>going to be used in my work so what I'm<br>working on the piece of writing is being<br>written as almost like a graphic novel<br>kind of thing so so you know I I like<br>tactile things I'm very stimulated by<br>visual things and the only the only<br>fantasy world that I live in in my head<br>is that from a lot of my own experience<br>I'm not a children's book writer who<br>creates an imaginary dystopian world<br>that's not my kind of I can't think that<br>way I'm<br>so um the and the other other project<br>that I've been distracted by while I've<br>been here<br>um is is from my 12 year old self yeah<br>it's written from the point of view of a<br>12 year old boy but it's it's it's<br>my inner kid so that's where I come from<br>lovely<br>my next question for you all is um to<br>reflect on um who your work is for is it<br>for yourself for your public or for your<br>audience whoever that may be and does<br>that<br>affect your creative process<br>knowing that you've got to produce<br>something for<br>somebody else rather than just doing it<br>so who are you doing this for<br>I could jump and I it's not always the<br>same but um<br>before<br>the wonderful Burns Fellowship I had a<br>small Artisan residence position at St<br>Hilda's which they just started an<br>artist in Residence<br>uh position and<br>um<br>for that working with those young women<br>and creating a work sort of with them I<br>wanted to show them part of how you<br>might approach creating a workshopping a<br>play but that they also felt<br>authentically told their stories and<br>I've noticed I've been thinking more and<br>more the past year or so about maybe<br>some works that would have spoken to me<br>when I was a teenager and was started to<br>get the seeds of an idea of hey this is<br>something<br>I could do<br>yeah<br>so<br>um I think my particular project is for<br>all those blocks that you've mentioned<br>uh<br>that's why I can explain it is to go<br>through how the project is<br>um yeah running uh so the idea is to<br>bridge different communities bringing<br>together diverse people from diverse<br>backgrounds into one safe space that you<br>know they feel uh they belong and in the<br>in the long run celebrate diversity<br>because in my dance classes we have<br>people who are like younger than 10 and<br>older than 50 and different experiences<br>different backgrounds different reasons<br>why they are there so in that sense like<br>really pretty much bring you together<br>people who usually wouldn't interact if<br>they kept in their you know proper uh<br>way of life so that kind of the<br>destruction<br>um<br>yeah<br>Sparks something in them because it's<br>not the norm that have been doing all<br>through so uh<br>to go back to who it is for I think uh I<br>believe that Community<br>impacts best if it impacts itself so<br>first of all I have to become part of<br>the community so a lot of energy goes<br>into like really building Mutual<br>relationships with those people and<br>connecting with as many different<br>circles as possible so that everyone<br>feels welcome that if I'm laughing in<br>class they know I'm laughing with them<br>and I'm not laughing at them so<br>uh how it affects me as a person or<br>creative person is that even if I've<br>done so many creative uh sorry Community<br>Dance projects in different countries<br>still every Community behaves<br>differently so I I need to come with an<br>open mind to realize that okay it's<br>gonna be different from how you talk<br>people with Alzheimer's in Netherlands<br>it's going to be different from how you<br>taught kids in Germany so you have you<br>know a bit of like a sketch idea of<br>where it's going but then be open to<br>surprises and see how you can play<br>around with them so right now we are<br>working on the show uh that have never<br>probably done before so more than 50<br>people on stage and like I said it's so<br>diverse you know in terms of ability age<br>and level of experience and<br>nationalities so I'm also learning as I<br>as we go because they're also bringing<br>us much creativity on the table so I see<br>what they have twist it a bit see how<br>you know we can put this whole show<br>together which you are all invited to by<br>the way win win we'll have a commercial<br>break can you tell us when and where do<br>you know when when there's yeah we know<br>when where uh it's going to be at the<br>casa one uh the lecture theater still in<br>the premises and it's going to be on the<br>24th of August and it's at 5 00 p.m and<br>it's by donation<br>yeah so anyway you can go to Eventbrite<br>if you want to book tickets because<br>they're kind of running so fast so but I<br>would wish to see you specifically there<br>yeah<br>Dylan yep<br>um does your<br>um creative process sorry is your<br>creative process affected by who you're<br>doing this for<br>yeah well it's different every time like<br>um<br>it can really depend on on who's<br>requesting the work<br>um but there is a Common Thread through<br>shouldn't feel embarrassed about it I'm<br>writing for myself<br>um you're writing for yourself yes but<br>um<br>I am always considering how a work is<br>going to be registered by listeners<br>um so I think that's it's quite comradly<br>in a way I<br>do work a lot with with ambiguity<br>as a way for the audience or the<br>listeners<br>to<br>complete the the picture in their own<br>imagination so<br>it is yeah it's a an important<br>consideration that this is going to be<br>registered and and heard by<br>by a group of people<br>yeah saying that you're writing for<br>yourself that's one thing I guess the<br>the other side of that is I remember<br>I was a Mozart fellow many years ago<br>said that he<br>or she<br>um<br>didn't actually care if nobody ever<br>listened to do it because that wasn't<br>what they were doing it for their<br>creative process was to do it just for<br>themselves but surely with music it<br>should be that communication with<br>somebody other than just yourself well I<br>think it has to exist in a in an oral<br>space<br>where it is considered<br>um through others hearing and and others<br>imagination<br>um<br>yeah like I think that's sort of futile<br>really<br>um and again<br>um are you affected by who you're<br>creating for<br>uh yeah extremely I I'm almost the<br>opposite of you I think audiences<br>everything to my work<br>um<br>I think about it constantly<br>yeah and I think there's I would hope<br>that the audience in front of me would<br>be my audience but um as we're in an art<br>gallery and and I recognize a lot of<br>people but I can kind of divide it up I<br>think a lot of my work would be for<br>artists and for painters particularly<br>um but then recently my work's become<br>quite involved and interested in kind of<br>codes and particularly queer codes so<br>I'd say then my work's also focused<br>towards a queer audience<br>um it's interested in art history so<br>it'll be directed at people who<br>recognize or identify<br>familiarities in the painting<br>so yeah I think I can kind of split it<br>up but I would just want<br>as much of an audience as I could and I<br>think yeah I can't not every time I make<br>a mark I'm thinking about the work being<br>received and completed by an audience so<br>do you know when to<br>put down the<br>papers yep you do yeah<br>yeah I<br>I get asked that question I think every<br>penny gets asked that question a lot and<br>I think<br>that only can it's a very simple answer<br>you decided to paint it you decided to<br>start it so you get to decide when it<br>ends so it's completely subjective and<br>personal and yeah<br>okay so yes so you don't go back three<br>um<br>no it's a bit more ambiguous I think for<br>music<br>um<br>I don't know if it's a luxury or not but<br>from right from the beginning it<br>bypasses figurative representation<br>um<br>so<br>we do work with a different vocabulary<br>and<br>that has to be filtered through people's<br>um<br>concentration and I think they can be<br>can really differ from from<br>individual<br>um<br>so it can be difficult but I tend to<br>move with<br>yes and<br>um<br>a an amount of material if it's<br>sort of served as purpose and it's in<br>its lifespan and viewing it from all<br>different kinds of angles<br>and spinning it out for<br>you know it's sort of natural lifespan<br>that tends to indicate to me that I've<br>Antonio I guess yours would be slightly<br>more obvious would it when you know a<br>work is complete yeah that's one at a<br>time<br>yeah that's the shot that would be like<br>the conclusion of my fellowship yeah<br>okay<br>do you know when you're finished a<br>particular work<br>um well if it's illustration for books<br>it's book it's when you sent it off to<br>this scanner and or have an opportunity<br>to photoshop any bits that weren't right<br>and uh when it's in the book it's<br>finished but um when you're actually so<br>that's that's one process with<br>illustration when it's done it's done<br>and you're always worship when you get<br>the book back I wish I'd done that<br>picture better there's always something<br>that you like more than others but you<br>there's a deadline so you've got to get<br>it done you haven't got the luxury of<br>yeah but wanted a better word Fanning<br>about natural honor<br>um but um but when you finish<br>um uh like the novel I'm writing at the<br>moment Junior fiction novel going<br>stunningly loving it it's just coming<br>coming in a rash and and uh when I write<br>the end that's actually only this time<br>because<br>that's the end of<br>the end it's your first draft<br>essentially or possibly second if you've<br>written your first draft and longhand<br>and then then tried to that and then<br>then you need to send it out to uh if<br>you've got an editor uh your readers<br>you've got and then it will become back<br>and everybody will point out the huge<br>plot holes and<br>go why are they 12 in this thing and<br>when they're why are they 11 you know a<br>few chapters on there are things that<br>you've forgotten so it's it that's the<br>process until you actually get to a<br>it takes a while to get that to a<br>publishable stage and then when it's a<br>book it's finished and then you'll<br>so Emily do you know when you're<br>finished I have a couple of uh finishing<br>points but they're not absolute so um in<br>terms of a pre-production script I feel<br>ready that I want to hand it over to a<br>creative<br>who do all those amazing things that I<br>can write down in my scripts but they<br>have to actually figure out how to make<br>happen I also tend to do a post<br>production script because it hasn't<br>really loved until it's lived live and<br>then um I can sit in the audience a few<br>times and yeah then I'll go away and do<br>a also tidy up and then that gets sent<br>off so you sort of have the lecture of<br>having a having a<br>a review after you've finished by doing<br>the final final yeah like even with<br>workshopping process you can't judge<br>everything until there's been that life<br>but that leads me into my next question<br>actually about you know a book will last<br>um but a painting and a piece of music<br>and a dance work<br>um are actually owned by other people<br>or in other people's hands as a play<br>um<br>but that sort of vanished after their<br>first performance so how does that how<br>does that feel as a as a creator that<br>you either it's here and then it's gone<br>or it's actually in somebody else's<br>hands to do something else with is that<br>a had a painful process it's about<br>letting go of the baby basically sort of<br>process is that tricky<br>it can be yeah it can be yeah yeah<br>it's also quite exciting<br>um having interpreted as realized<br>something for you<br>um but it is uh can be quite difficult<br>like saying maybe you get a performance<br>and then it can can vanish<br>um I feel that every piece of work you<br>do becomes a part of the DNA of your<br>next thing<br>um so in that sense it doesn't really<br>ever go<br>um well<br>sometimes we're fortunate to have<br>multiple performances<br>um<br>nervous for you as a as a composer<br>having somebody take your work and do it<br>and interpret it maybe not the way that<br>you had envisaged it or maybe<br>interpreting it in a slightly different<br>way a better way a worse way<br>it's just part of the process yeah it is<br>part of it uh you do have to<br>to let go<br>um you can be quite fastidious about<br>but<br>often with really skilled interpreters<br>they actually bring something to it that<br>you that uncover something that you<br>didn't didn't know<br>okay<br>let me imagine you um<br>for your life and soul into a work and<br>then<br>it's in a gallery or somebody buys it<br>and that's it you've lost it is that<br>good<br>the money in the bank's good<br>uh it's kind of worse if the paintings<br>come back from the day because they<br>can't sell them but no it is said they<br>are babies<br>um that's painful to think about them<br>but I still own the copyright of the<br>image so that's good I don't own the<br>object<br>um<br>yeah I think having them as images<br>reproductions is is good to look back<br>through them and have that as objects<br>and like you said the choreographer<br>Antonio<br>um that a work is created particularly<br>in the community context<br>um it's created in everybody is engaged<br>and then it's called<br>is that okay<br>um<br>I think maybe the<br>I've never really thought about that but<br>now that I think about it I think<br>it mostly goes back to credit that if<br>someone else did kind of the same thing<br>that to acknowledge you know that okay<br>someone<br>thought so much about a particular idea<br>that I'm kind of duplicating<br>but uh I I think there's also still a<br>pleasure of like giving back to<br>something that lives through other<br>people so yeah it really just goes back<br>to you know like<br>uh as a person like uh yeah how do they<br>treat the work that they've you know<br>they've duplicated yeah so it's it's I<br>would say it's a different situation in<br>different right and uh it's really it<br>still goes also back to the earning part<br>if I think about as a choreographer not<br>as a community dance practitioner but<br>you know uh if you realize someone else<br>is using it to make way much more money<br>than you did sometimes it can it can<br>kind of<br>yeah but it is what it is you know you<br>just have to make sure the time when you<br>release it if it's a choreography then<br>you yeah<br>yeah I understand I've got a couple more<br>questions because time is moving on<br>um FIFA you mentioned before<br>um about uh one one a publication is<br>done and you look back at it and think<br>oh could have done that different<br>is that um is that a question for you<br>all about<br>um looking back on your earlier work and<br>maybe wishing you done it differently or<br>maybe not even put it out into the<br>public domain<br>or do you just not go there<br>is that scary or<br>um no I I think it's a problem that what<br>Dylan was saying it's all part of your<br>DNA I I<br>don't think it's good to have a place<br>for regret it's sad because it sounds<br>sort of regretful you know you you<br>no I don't feel any of my Works exists<br>there might be<br>um distinct projects but they don't<br>exist in isolation that yeah yeah yeah<br>yeah they were all my babies in some way<br>yeah<br>um I I only have one regret Possible Oh<br>no apart from apart from some of the<br>commercial art illustration that I did<br>years ago which I had never come back to<br>haunt me dogs wearing water wings for<br>you know cool cool accessory catalogs<br>and things like that<br>um and and occasionally Dawn does come<br>up and and you go oh no that's when I<br>didn't know how to draw anything and I<br>was a new graduate and I didn't know<br>anything<br>um and and there's only one book where I<br>really wish I had done my research<br>better and uh and it was a book called<br>Papa's Island by Melanie Drury and I did<br>I didn't do uh historical research on<br>the uniforms particularly well and um<br>and it was picked up by a reviewer it<br>was the only thing that they wanted to<br>talk about because there was some<br>military collections<br>okay<br>um and uh but but now having actually<br>made military uniforms for costuming I<br>am I'm actually a geek too so<br>um I understand it so you know it's only<br>where I haven't done my research<br>properly<br>because I ran out of time or I didn't<br>think it mattered so research research<br>is so critical yeah for everything else<br>I love that I love her about it<br>so if any of you felt that you would<br>rather it wasn't out there<br>what you've done previously constantly<br>constantly every day okay I think every<br>painting is<br>aiming to towards<br>more of something that something that<br>another one in the past didn't manage<br>okay<br>yeah I don't know I constantly look back<br>at work and think wow that's terrible so<br>this is this is self-criticism I use it<br>all the time just yeah there's a way of<br>part of your process yeah and I think<br>you just you grow and you learn and you<br>just get better and so you're constantly<br>critiquing yeah<br>so<br>it's different from the same time yeah<br>so you're making the same I think well<br>yeah similar um you can see it as<br>essential building blocks to where you<br>are now it reflects<br>something of where you're at at the time<br>um<br>and it's like anything in life isn't it<br>yeah<br>um no comment<br>um yeah yeah indeed uh one more question<br>and that is um the fellowships at the<br>University of otago are a wonderful<br>thing but as I understand<br>there is no compulsion that's not<br>compulsory that during your time that<br>you actually create anything<br>specifically<br>is that a freedom or an impediment<br>is that good<br>um<br>I think it's uh a pretty good thing<br>because I think a lot of the weight goes<br>to the judges that if they choose the<br>right people like these people right<br>here then<br>yeah then it becomes quite easier to be<br>honest because you really have to be<br>proactive and push yourself because<br>originally the fellowship States I have<br>to do an event but I already did one<br>event I'm gonna do another one just<br>because I love what I do and I want it<br>to be as you know as good as I wanted to<br>be so I mean you are I mean I'm enrolled<br>to what you know like uh has a lecturer<br>so while you know Monday Friday but I'm<br>usually there on the weekends or working<br>late the other morning that at five a.m<br>like that people cleaning open the door<br>they're like oh what's going on I was on<br>my lap because I missed a week when I<br>was in Uganda so I think you know since<br>we are working in areas where you have<br>to be passionate about what you do then<br>it becomes quite easier for you to<br>manage your time if there's no one like<br>really saying okay don't work weekends I<br>want you Monday Friday you know so that<br>freedom is pretty good for the creative<br>um can I just jump into it<br>um I I thought we had to produce<br>something<br>well now everybody know everybody<br>everybody said everybody past fellows<br>have gone the only expectation is what's<br>what you put on yourself and I put I<br>because I'm a really deadline driver not<br>I've always been freelance so I'm really<br>in complete charge of whether I earn<br>anything or not and<br>um and so I'm hugely deadline driven uh<br>and uh and and my partner has been<br>saying so how's that novel going for you<br>how's that novel going I've been told uh<br>but I but I've done I've looked back<br>over the six months and I've I've<br>managed to cram so much in and produce<br>quite a lot of work in lots of different<br>areas<br>um and<br>um but yes I think one of the I like I<br>sit on right at the Polytech Hub and do<br>long handwriting and then go back to the<br>teachers College into my office and type<br>it up and I'm thinking this is so<br>amazing because in my normal life as a<br>freelancer I couldn't do that I couldn't<br>just go and sit and write for that and<br>then go and type it up and and still<br>earn money anyway<br>it's it's um yeah it's fabulous<br>I one of the huge benefits of this year<br>is<br>um<br>being able to mix up how I work<br>um I mean I I don't have an issue with<br>producing work but to try different<br>approaches<br>um and when I really love being able to<br>do more of is actually get more reading<br>done around the areas because you just<br>don't have time otherwise<br>um and I find I write alongside reading<br>that's why I do a lot of my long hands<br>that will spark off things and then I'll<br>go into my office where there's no<br>housework<br>yeah so the the Mozart and the Hodgkins<br>there's no there's no there's no<br>requirement is there yeah I think there<br>is actually I mean I have a shot I have<br>an exhibition at the Hawken and I was<br>going to say I think it's both it's it's<br>good to have flexibility to cater<br>to to support people where they might<br>find themselves in life like them you<br>might find yourself in a spot where you<br>can't<br>um make work and it's good that that's<br>that's okay but then also I think it's<br>really good to be able to give back to<br>the community that supported you here<br>and and my way that's through exhibition<br>making and and showing work and working<br>um<br>I do feel quite aware that uh it's in<br>it's a finite amount of time we have so<br>I do want to feel<br>um the year with this important things<br>and also give back to the the community<br>so<br>I've been able to plan a lot of<br>performances while I've been here and I<br>think that's important<br>and it's not really any real requirement<br>to finish a body of work actually with<br>the Microsoft Fellowship<br>um<br>but yeah it's a gift having all the time<br>so you have to use it<br>thank you<br>um I'd like to open it to the floor now<br>if anybody has a question or two which<br>they would like to ask any of the<br>dentists<br>then there's a microphone so we can all<br>hear you<br>don't shy<br>are you enjoying your time here is it<br>nice to be in Dunedin can can I answer<br>coming from Wellington I loved it yes<br>it's just been I've only ever spent like<br>a day and Dunedin before and and it's<br>just been the most wonderful place<br>everybody's been incredibly helpful and<br>kind and it's beautiful we've been out<br>to Central and we went to Stewart Island<br>and it's um uh and I found myself<br>looking at real estate pages and you<br>know thinking that we sold our house in<br>Wellington you know so yeah Wellington<br>dunedin's been absolutely magical I've<br>loved every single Village<br>yeah I'm also loving Dunedin because I<br>was in Auckland for two times before<br>um coming here and I love the fact that<br>it's quite different and uh<br>having not had the opportunity to be at<br>the University I really love the campus<br>feeling of of the University you know<br>because it was quite different with the<br>University of Auckland when I had a<br>fellowship there because the buildings<br>are so scattered in the city but really<br>that Compass Vibe like really yeah I<br>just love seeing a lot of people walking<br>up and down you know yeah so yeah pretty<br>much building is a very long way from<br>Uganda yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>that's pretty long but definitely worth<br>to anybody else<br>it's me not to ask questions however I<br>um Antonio I'm concerned that you appear<br>not to be able to record a permanent or<br>a record of your artistic your dance<br>compared with your fellows<br>um and you mentioned copyright because<br>people can take your movements<br>um<br>do you video it so then you can make a<br>copyright I'm not sure I've just thought<br>how would you record make a permanent<br>record of your artistic expression of<br>your dance<br>uh<br>uh that is definitely a big challenge<br>because really it's kind of hard to<br>copyrighted and own it and you know<br>yeah I pretty much just put it in it in<br>in the category of challenges you know<br>that's why I said like it's it's just uh<br>satisfying at least to be accredited you<br>know uh I think I can give an example of<br>uh one of the regrets uh we already went<br>through regrets but I'll give this one<br>more uh that uh the the breakdance<br>project Uganda that I talked about that<br>we started with a group of you know<br>young people so we just you know met<br>without any uh<br>long idea of where it's going to go but<br>we just came together started practicing<br>different uh kids from different suburbs<br>joined us and they were like okay let's<br>name it something we name it break dance<br>project Uganda and it grown now it's<br>like over hundreds and hundreds of young<br>people across the country but then<br>Hollywood came in and they made a<br>documentary and they decided to put the<br>story into a one man's Vision so they<br>credited only one of my colleagues so<br>like and it's like if it's out there<br>it's out there so they kind of Changed<br>History but there's literally nothing I<br>can do about it but so yeah<br>so it's it's it happens and it's the<br>challenge but I I don't know how we can<br>what we can do about it maybe that will<br>anyone else sorry<br>um I'd like to ask mention about you<br>saying about your<br>um<br>being able to retain the rights to your<br>image yes<br>what does that really mean I think it's<br>a it's a kind of it just happens as soon<br>as the image is produced so I can use<br>the images of my work for anything<br>so I can't use you need permission from<br>me yeah in our borders<br>it doesn't really belong to me I'm not<br>sure and maybe does anyone can anyone<br>else answer that question so basically<br>um when you have been dead for 50 years<br>but<br>um copyright and uh in European<br>countries is the business they've been<br>dead for 70 years and then you've been<br>using them without asking for copyright<br>if you want copyright you have to ask<br>Imogen if it's all right if you use her<br>work for a particular purpose and then<br>um she will say yes you can and you can<br>but if she says no you can't use it for<br>that but if you want to use it for this<br>then I'm happy with that or whatever but<br>basically the the image is owned by the<br>artist until they're being dead for 50<br>years in New Zealand no it's just I was<br>just thinking about I was just thinking<br>about the um<br>the t-shirts that you see around the<br>place that have images of famous people<br>or<br>different people<br>you know how does that work well I<br>probably shouldn't I'm not sure about<br>that but I often think about the kind of<br>Gordon Walters paintings and obviously<br>he's been how long has he been dead and<br>I don't think about them that much but<br>yeah<br>um the phone I mean they would have had<br>to get that that those paintings have<br>been appropriated a lot of times and<br>remade into other images in New Zealand<br>people should get permission always<br>um<br>the other thing is the um does that<br>apply to Everyday Use of say jelly beans<br>or chewing gum does that applies<br>but you know if you if you transpose<br>them onto t-shirts and other materials<br>you have to get permission yeah<br>no word for that if you want to put the<br>image on the packet I could probably<br>give you a succinct example that maybe<br>you give it a context that<br>um so for my PhD thesis I included an<br>image of a Marilyn Webb<br>um work under Graham Sydney work neither<br>of those Works were owned<br>by Sydney or Webb at that time but it's<br>the onus was still on me as I did to<br>seek their permission and my thesis that<br>three people only ever read<br>um me the person who proofread it and<br>maybe my mother I don't believe<br>um<br>so I still had to but they didn't<br>physically own those images I had to get<br>permission from them<br>so so something that's out in the public<br>general public you can use that image<br>say like the first church<br>copyrighted because that's a that's a<br>sorry there are lawyers for this yes<br>right no I was just thinking about uh<br>you know the University of otago with<br>the Clock Tower and everything that<br>seems to come up in a lot of<br>images<br>ah yeah well it's more than a 50 years<br>old and it's it's totally well it's not<br>dead<br>just before we finish are there any more<br>questions<br>um just to do with like the<br>responsibility is a Creative Group in<br>individuals like how does it feel when<br>there's like so many issues that are<br>becoming like known and so obvious and<br>blatantly in our faces but like as<br>creative people it feels like you're not<br>getting heard and it's really hard when<br>you know you're an artist and you're<br>like oh no one's actually gonna<br>hear what I have to say or take it<br>seriously because it's something that<br>some reason people don't but there's<br>still this huge obligation and<br>responsibility that you get with<br>creating works because other people are<br>going to see it or hear it or watch it<br>and it's beautiful but yeah how does how<br>a sort of social conscience I think yeah<br>nobody wants to answer that<br>um it's a children's book writer I have<br>no social conscience about anything it's<br>set to<br>um uh not cause harm to the kids that<br>are reading or or looking at my staff<br>but you know like with where with<br>wearable art for instance it's a story<br>and so have I got something political<br>that I want to say I might say it<br>through that Medium but you know I<br>personally am not a a political artist I<br>say everything I need to on my private<br>Facebook page not the public one but<br>Emerson you might have a different you<br>might have a different view because I<br>think you're um you know yeah yeah I was<br>thinking about this yeah that I think<br>about it a lot with climate change and<br>being a painter who's not my work isn't<br>directly about that but I think about it<br>I get anxious about it a lot and I guess<br>it um it is somehow through the work but<br>it's it's good to remember that it's a<br>long-term career so there might maybe<br>something will come up later on<br>but like the other day I went to protest<br>at ehumatal and then had to go to and<br>give a talk about<br>painting it was really strange but<br>um<br>yeah I don't think you have to take it<br>all on your back and and and try and be<br>a superhero but you try and do what you<br>can<br>in your field and and it's can be super<br>like specialized and it can still be<br>helping in some way<br>even just being an artist and being<br>um and and being um out there and being<br>in a community and and showing that<br>people that you can choose that kind of<br>work I think in itself is<br>really important<br>yeah<br>um<br>I would to comment on that I think uh<br>as a dancer I feel fortunate to be<br>operating in a medium that makes people<br>happy and joyful so I'm so interested in<br>this you know in the social<br>situations but I'm also happy that<br>already<br>you know bringing a certain joy and love<br>to people is already you know a positive<br>impact uh but of course I still have<br>like uh some topics that I'm always<br>interested in like racism obviously and<br>here and there I think<br>uh I attack that with just<br>like I said interacting with people you<br>know it doesn't even have to be like the<br>dance itself but like when I was here I<br>joined the soccer group I play with<br>soccer with them so maybe for them it<br>was still the first time they<br>encountered with the person from Uganda<br>so really yeah<br>I'm aware of it and I'm interested in it<br>but sometimes it won't be uh so obvious<br>in my project goals but I'm really<br>interested in it yeah<br>I think that's right I'm gonna try<br>um I think the best thing is is when you<br>I do a lot of school visits and go and<br>sit and talk to school groups and the<br>best thing is when you're walking out of<br>a school and you hear kids going I'm<br>gonna be an artist and you think my work<br>here is done their parents will be<br>appalled<br>uh ladies and gentlemen I think we'll<br>call it today I'd like uh you to join<br>with me in in thinking Imogen Dylan<br>Antonio<br>Fifi and uh Emily for their time this<br>and I would also like to thank the<br>University of otago for Tony Valentine<br>and Wendy Adams for
