the Central<br>otago District Council where I'm trying<br>to understand the opportunities that<br>fruit processes may have when trying to<br>combat Regional fruit loss and waste<br>as many of you know fruit wasters food<br>waste is a problem<br>and it has been named one of the things<br>that we can do to try and fight climate<br>change and how a region can collaborate<br>and come together and fight this problem<br>altogether is something that hasn't been<br>done before so it's a really exciting<br>space<br>um essentially what I did is I went<br>through to central otago conducted 10<br>semi-structured interviews with a range<br>of different processes in the region<br>um and tried to get an understanding of<br>their perception of the issue as well as<br>what they're creating<br>um what equipment they're using the<br>utilization of their equipment the<br>storage that they have and trying to get<br>a really holistic view in terms of what<br>they think Solutions may look like for<br>um it's really cool because many people<br>are out there and I found that they care<br>a lot about the issue and fruit waste is<br>very close to their hearts they work<br>pretty hard for what they do and so<br>seeing it go to waste is pretty yeah<br>it's it's not that fun so<br>um a lot of Growers have come up with<br>creative ways to repurpose this so<br>whether it looks like pasteurizing their<br>pulp which is a byproduct of something<br>and stabilizing it so then therefore it<br>can be repurposed later<br>or creating their own worm farm which<br>they then in turn use the promise from<br>their juicing to nourish that worm farm<br>um however there are a lot of barriers<br>that have come up to show why people<br>maybe aren't utilizing the resources as<br>much as they could<br>um so for example a lot of businesses<br>and companies in the region are very<br>small they're very isolated they don't<br>have Big Marketing teams so they find it<br>really hard to infiltrate markets and<br>therefore sell product and why would you<br>make more product when you can't sell<br>secondary to this people are very proud<br>of their knowledge that they've managed<br>to<br>collect and all together so therefore<br>sharing that knowledge can be a bit of a<br>barrier in wanting to work with others<br>um so therefore a next step in terms of<br>what could be done next in the region is<br>looking at those barriers and trying to<br>understand ways that we can then<br>therefore break them down and help those<br>in the region collaborate and come<br>together<br>um trying to reduce fruit loss overall<br>so as you can see here in my little<br>schematic<br>um maybe you've got chairs from Cromwell<br>coming in and getting Frozen and Alex<br>um and then they'll go to the throw to<br>the tibia Valley where they can be<br>Juiced and made into concentrate<br>um so yeah and then it's it's also<br>awesome and really exciting next coming<br>up for this project is<br>um looking at the nutritionals of fruit<br>in Central otago and what that may look<br>like and whether it's a unique selling<br>point to them<br>um and it's all eyes on Central Targo at<br>the moment<br>um and with the hopes to inspire other<br>fruit and vegetable growing regions in<br>the country to make similar actions<br>themselves<br>um and try also find ways that they can<br>reduce their fruit loss and waste<br>cure to everyone my name is Lizzie<br>cunliff and I am a fourth year consumer<br>food science honor student studying here<br>at the University of otago<br>my research dissertation this year is on<br>upcycling<br>specifically looking into insights into<br>upcycling from a manufacturer's<br>perspective<br>to gather these insights I went out and<br>spoke to food manufacturers directly<br>I spoke to those who are currently<br>upcycling food or those who are<br>interested or have explored the<br>potential to upcycle<br>the objective of my interviews was to<br>discover the challenges opportunities<br>and support needed to promote the<br>development of the sector in aotearoa<br>I conducted a thematic analysis to<br>decipher the results of the interviews<br>into coded themes based on the frequency<br>of occurrence<br>consumer perception was a reoccurring<br>theme presented in the challenges<br>people often question why should I buy<br>this product if it is a reused waste<br>the main challenge is educating the<br>consumer that the product is food safe<br>nutritionally good and a good thing for<br>the environment<br>concerns around safety quality and<br>Logistics<br>depending on the Surplus it may have a<br>limited shelf life<br>to transport this producers need to<br>consider whether the Surplus product is<br>still going to arrive in a usable state<br>for further processing<br>without deterioration<br>quality and safety concerns also Arise<br>at how the Surplus is treated at the<br>initial processing step<br>one manufacturer stated that they have<br>really struggled with getting a surplus<br>of a knowable enough quality as the<br>producers view these products as waste<br>the first benefit is the positive<br>environmental impact of upcycling<br>although many strategies such as food<br>waste prevention are needed to combat<br>the food waste problem upcycling takes<br>products out of the waste cycle and<br>utilizes resources as much as possible<br>by putting them back into the food<br>ecosystem<br>another benefit is the story side of<br>upcycling there is a feel-good story<br>attached to upcycling<br>one manufacturer stated people respond<br>very well to the story it is a unique<br>selling point looking at a cost<br>perspective another benefit is that<br>companies are getting a fairly cheap raw<br>material and transforming it into a high<br>value product<br>in terms of the external support needed<br>to promote the upcycling sector a wider<br>PR angle is needed to educate the public<br>on a macro level of the benefits of<br>upcycling<br>another big support system identified<br>would be an external third-party<br>establishment to support upcycling<br>for example a potential Independent<br>party who was there to assist the<br>potential value of any food surplus<br>provides skills and knowledge in the<br>sector as well as facilitate the<br>collaboration of organizations to<br>upcycle<br>another area of support is funding a<br>turn off for manufacturers wanting to<br>upcycle is the high initial costs<br>associated with the research processing<br>equipment connections people skills as<br>well as infrastructure<br>overall I am hoping that my research<br>will encourage more manufacturers to<br>how many people here like a nice crisp<br>clear beer are pilsner perhaps well too<br>bad the world's gone hazy why is that I<br>hear you ask is because of the delicious<br>power of hops you see your conventional<br>beer your pilsners and your lagers<br>utilize hops only in the boiling stage<br>of Brewing<br>during this process the bittering<br>precursors the alpha acids are<br>transformed into the iso-alpha acids<br>that make the delicious bitterness of<br>your favorite beer<br>hcps utilize the second process<br>alongside boiling to deliver even more<br>flavor these flavors are the floral and<br>tropical flavors that have taken over<br>the New Zealand craft beer scene<br>this process is called dry hopping where<br>hops are added to the cold beer post<br>fermentation<br>this extracts all those flavors that<br>just can't handle the heat<br>most hot components are fairly insoluble<br>in cold conditions so without the heat<br>aiding the extraction process it results<br>in the Hops being poorly utilized not<br>only does this mean that a lot of hops<br>must be used to deliver their wonderful<br>flavor<br>but also that many of the relatively<br>insoluble compounds such as the alpha<br>acids are still retained in the Hops<br>after dry hopping<br>this is a big waste of the Hops<br>potential but where lies the true<br>problem<br>the problem lies in the slurry recovered<br>after dry hopping a mix of Hops Beer and<br>yeast the slurry has a hefty<br>environmental impact due to the high<br>biological oxygen demand it has and its<br>high nutritional content it is it is<br>also a costly waste to treat<br>uh represents a loss of beer for the<br>brewery this results in a waste that has<br>a high cost for both the environment and<br>the business and I want to help address<br>this<br>my research is looking into the<br>potential for recovery and evaluation of<br>spinth hops as a bettering agent in the<br>boil stage of Brewing<br>this will be done by reusing the<br>retained Alpha acids the bittering<br>compounds in the spent hops in a new<br>Brew<br>the aim of This research being to assess<br>how well spit hops perform in comparison<br>to Fresh hops in the boiling stage and<br>whether they could be a viable and more<br>the impacts of This research benefit the<br>environment and reduce waste by allowing<br>partial or even full replacement of<br>bittering hops with spent hops from the<br>fermenter this will reduce the amount of<br>fresh hop used and reduce the amount of<br>hop derived biological waste entering<br>the wastewater treatment system or<br>landfill the benefits can be realized by<br>breweries as they will be able to reduce<br>the cost surrounding the purchase for<br>free shops and reduce the amount of<br>money spent on waste disposal<br>overall my research wants to make the<br>bird is one of the largest contributors<br>to food waste at the grocery retail<br>level due to being withdrawn from the<br>grocery shelves closer to enough shelf<br>life and going to either animal feed<br>compost or landfill we're shown to<br>contribute to CO2 emissions<br>upcycling which is the concept of adding<br>value to ingredients that would<br>otherwise be wasted<br>is one of their ways to reduce bread<br>waste and its impact on the environment<br>examples of up chocolate bread products<br>in New Zealand include beer from<br>citizens Brewery then from the Dunedin<br>craft distillers and baked goods and<br>condiments from Rescue kitchen<br>one of the ways can be upcycled is by<br>turning into a flower similar to what is<br>being done by risky kitchen<br>to do this the bird is simply dried and<br>grown up to a fine powder however the<br>applications of this upcycled bread<br>flour are limited due to the fundamental<br>changes that the wheat flour undergoes<br>during breaking<br>narrow starch molecules found in the<br>wheat flour used to make bread are<br>damaged resulting in them having an<br>increased ability to absorb and hold<br>water secondly the gluten proteins are<br>denatured which leads to a loss in<br>gluten functionality and the resulting<br>upcycled bread flour pollution plays a<br>vital role in brood as it contributes to<br>the final texture and provides structure<br>to trap gas cells thus creating volume<br>upcycle brickflow has had some<br>successful applications and cookies<br>cakes and extruded snacks however there<br>has been a limited application for use<br>in bread making as both these changes<br>are detrimental to dough properties and<br>finer brake qualities<br>my research is investigating how to up<br>how to make upcycled bread using flour<br>made from bread I started by<br>substituting varying amounts of outside<br>of Brook flour in place of wheat flour<br>during bread making to determine the<br>maximum amount of UPS like a bread flour<br>that can be substituted before<br>significant changes in brood quality<br>occurred<br>I then looked at what else could be<br>added to maximize the amount of upcycled<br>bread flour substitute while maintaining<br>the bread quality<br>the additives are used were Native<br>gluten and Alpha amylase which they<br>starch regarding enzyme<br>a 10 to 25 substitution only resulted in<br>a slight decline in final Bridge quality<br>while a 50 substitution level resulted<br>in a significant decline in final Brit<br>Colony when compared to bread mate was<br>100 wheat flour<br>quality aspects I assist were crossed in<br>chrome color low volume and texture<br>parameters such as hardness and<br>chewiness<br>the individual individual edition of<br>gluten and Alpha amylase resulted in a<br>significant Improvement in all final<br>brake qualities when compared to the<br>bread made with 50 laps like a bread<br>flour<br>the combined use of both gluten and<br>Alpha amylase resulted in a slightly<br>improved outcomes compared to the use of<br>them individually but the effect was<br>lower than expected however the use of<br>additives although useful still did not<br>result in a bread that was comparable in<br>quality to bread mate with 100 wheat<br>flour<br>I believe that upcycled bread flour can<br>help to reduce the use of wheat flour<br>and bread<br>help to reduce food waste and create<br>additional Revenue stream for<br>manufacturers<br>there's also this ISO represents an<br>opportunity to expand the upcycled food<br>category Beyond discretionary and snack<br>foods as bread as a stable food and mini<br>diets and can provide essential<br>nutrients<br>there is also potential for upcycle<br>bread to be sold as a dry baking mix<br>either as a consumer facing good or<br>business to business ingredient to be<br>produced<br>although the perfect bread was not<br>achieved in the study there may be no<br>need to replicate the properties of<br>conventional bread found in the<br>supermarket since upcycled foods are<br>being marketed as their own food<br>category<br>lastly to answer everyone's question<br>does bread from bread taste good yes it<br>does it's pretty good<br>have you ever thought about where your<br>eyes are looking or the facial<br>expressions that you're portraying when<br>looking at products in the supermarket<br>and have you ever considered how this<br>could be used for market research myself<br>and a group of fourth year students from<br>the University of<br>otago Food Science Department are<br>conducting a research project looking<br>into consumer perceptions of upcycled<br>food utilizing eye trekking and<br>automated facial expression analysis<br>Technologies we have created packaging<br>designs for an upcycled Oat Bar product<br>in a non-upcycled Oat Bar product we've<br>conducted these<br>with three different<br>in three different ways including a<br>value for money option a health-based<br>option and a environmentally friendly<br>option<br>packaging Communications have been<br>researched and valuable information has<br>been found so far some includes that<br>these the packaging Communications can<br>express sustainability about a product<br>to the consumer they can also show the<br>process that went into making into the<br>production of that product but most<br>importantly they help consumers<br>make their purchasing decisions in the<br>supermarket we collected 45 participants<br>from the University who aged between 18<br>and 25 had normal vision and had bought<br>a music bar in the last three months we<br>set them down one at a time at our<br>testing station which had two monitors<br>one for the researcher to make sure<br>everything was going quickly and the<br>other one for the participant to do the<br>task on and also had the eye tracking<br>and facial expression Hardware equipped<br>onto it<br>we provided them with a supermarket<br>scenario in which territories between<br>two products an upcycled<br>and while they're looking at the<br>packaging making the decisions the eye<br>movements and their facial expressions<br>are being recorded<br>we then got them fill out a<br>questionnaire surrounding their<br>familiarity around upcycling and then<br>after that we collected data on the<br>attitudes around upcycling Health<br>sustainability and economic and then<br>after at the end they were free to<br>choose and write down whether their<br>decisions were influenced Anyway by the<br>upcycling products there is a need for<br>the study as we need to evaluate how<br>packaging Communications can influence<br>consumer purchasing behavior in regards<br>to upcycled Foods there is a great<br>Market potential for upcycled Foods as<br>it poses a promising solution to help<br>take all the issue of food waste through<br>a circular economy we need to analyze<br>how consumers react to different<br>communication framings to reveal what<br>appropriate messages signals and queues<br>are required to increase acceptance for<br>upcycled products and how it aligns with<br>the economic health and sustainability<br>values we have just finished our data<br>analysis and now we are trying to read<br>into the data this heat map shows a<br>collated response of 45 participants and<br>we can see the areas of interest at the<br>back front and side of the pack so the<br>areas of Interest are the upcycling<br>Journey how upcycling process works and<br>hello everyone my name is Brian Mills<br>and I've just begun a master of science<br>at the University of otago with the<br>Departments of human nutrition and food<br>science and the sustainability office<br>food waste has been an interest of mine<br>for the last two years as it is a<br>combination of two things I am<br>passionate about sustainability and food<br>so when it came time to look into<br>post-grad study options it was something<br>I was Keen to explore<br>before beginning my MSC I completed a<br>research project with support from waste<br>management New Zealand this project<br>centered around food waste at tertiary<br>institutes around aotearoa because of<br>their large size tackling campus food<br>waste<br>will help tertiary institutes meet<br>carbon emission and landfill targets as<br>well as work towards sdg 12.3<br>I interviewed representatives from 13<br>universities polytechnics and wainanga<br>around aotearoa to discuss what<br>initiatives they had in place around<br>food waste<br>using the international best practice<br>Target measure act approach the<br>initiatives at each Institute were<br>categorized as you can see on the table<br>five institutes have formal targets<br>while six headless specific targets such<br>as net carbon 0 by 2030 without a focus<br>on food waste<br>Stephen institutes hit ongoing food<br>waste measurement including receiving<br>data from waste management companies<br>others had intermittent Audits and<br>estimates while one Institute had no<br>measurement<br>there were also a range of actions in<br>place with all institutes having at<br>least two initiatives in place<br>worm farms were a really popular<br>initiative with 11 institutes talking<br>about them 10 institutes also donate<br>leftovers from events to organizations<br>such as students associations and food<br>rescues<br>while there were over 20 initiatives<br>currently in place most were aimed at<br>dealing with too much waste rather than<br>focusing on not producing as much in<br>creating the waste in the first place<br>these approaches were towards the bottom<br>of the waste hierarchy indicating a need<br>for change<br>tertiary institutes in aotearoa need to<br>include food waste and formal goals<br>commit to regular measurements and<br>Implement actions focusing on prevention<br>rather than disposal<br>now with my masters project I'm going to<br>be doing an audit of all of the food<br>waste at the University of otago's<br>Dunedin campus primarily focusing on the<br>residential colleges<br>hopefully this will be the beginning of<br>the measure phase for otago and once<br>we've got an idea of how much food we<br>are wasting we can work on initiatives<br>to minimize it I'm excited to get<br>started and hope that this will have an<br>food waste is a problem in many<br>countries in the world and out there oh<br>is no exception<br>I am sure that the presenters before me<br>have already emphasized the scale of<br>food waste globally and in New Zealand<br>we're already aware of the<br>multi-dimensional impacts of food waste<br>on our environment food security and<br>economy<br>food waste needs to be tackled by a<br>multi-pronged approach that should<br>include providing infrastructure to<br>prevent food waste and having policies<br>and regulations in place to prevent food<br>waste by commercial food retailers<br>but being an educator I've always<br>believed that the third approach which<br>involves creating awareness among young<br>and old alike is a powerful tool to<br>reduce food waste as long as people are<br>simply passive consumers no incentives<br>or deterrence can prevent food waste<br>therefore my research focused on<br>education to increase awareness about<br>food waste among young adolescents and<br>promote positive behavior attitudes and<br>values towards it<br>so I designed an intervention based on<br>the findings of a pre-survey conducted<br>with the sample group<br>after the intervention the students<br>seemed more aware of the reasons for<br>food waste and also its direct and<br>indirect impacts<br>data analysis indicated an increased<br>positive behavior of the students<br>towards food waste their reported<br>attitudes and values towards food waste<br>also pointed towards a more positive<br>shift<br>they had improved food waste behavior in<br>their classroom too<br>they reported talking to their families<br>and whanau about food waste some even<br>started packing their lunch boxes with<br>the appropriate food portions so that<br>they didn't end up wasting food<br>many were eager to initiate food waste<br>composting or have worm bins in their<br>backyards it was amazing<br>moreover I also identified some barriers<br>which may not allow the students to<br>prevent food waste even if they want to<br>for example they may not have any say in<br>the decision making of buying food in<br>their family or decisions with leftover<br>food<br>the class teacher was another<br>stakeholder in this entire process and<br>played a crucial role in this journey<br>she also reported being more aware of<br>food waste issues after this<br>intervention which emphasizes the<br>usefulness of food waste education for<br>teachers too<br>my research highlights the importance of<br>including food waste education in the<br>New Zealand curriculum which will<br>promote the broadening of environmental<br>literacy among students and help in<br>mitigating the problem of food waste<br>everyone my name is Hayden printer and<br>I've just completed the master of<br>marketing course at the University of<br>otago with my thesis focusing on<br>consumer food West<br>so despite best intentions most<br>consumers throw away a substantial<br>amount of food every year with a<br>psychological phenomenon of the<br>intention Behavior Gap being identified<br>as a large barrier to reducing consumer<br>food waste the thesis explored two<br>alternative predictors of food waste<br>Behavior firstly as you can see in the<br>diagram the concept of trait mountainous<br>was brought into the intention Behavior<br>relationship trait mindfulness can be<br>understood as an individual's based on<br>propensity towards experiencing<br>mindfulness in everyday life it was<br>hypothesized that individuals with high<br>levels of trait mindfulness would<br>experience a reduced intention Behavior<br>Gap<br>the second alternative predictor<br>introduced to the model was the<br>consideration of food related routines<br>specifically the Federated routines of<br>planning shopping and leftover reuse<br>routines were considered as an<br>alternative route to predicting food<br>West Behavior than intention<br>to explore the relationships of Interest<br>a quantitative research approach was<br>chosen through the application of a<br>single online survey this was built<br>through qualtrics all participants that<br>evolved with the study were young<br>consumers aged 18 to 24 residing in<br>Dunedin and this was based off a 2021<br>report in New Zealand which identified<br>this demographic as being most wasteful<br>through simple moderation analysis it<br>was found that at higher levels of trait<br>mindfulness the relationship between<br>intention and behavior was strengthened<br>this is the first study to analyze the<br>moderating effect of mindfulness on the<br>intention Behavior Gap in the context of<br>food waste<br>several practical implications arose as<br>a result of this finding firstly it may<br>be beneficial for social marketers<br>government organizations and ngos to<br>direct food waste reduction<br>communication towards individuals with<br>high levels of mindfulness encouraging<br>intention to reduce food waste is likely<br>to resonate more of these individuals<br>due to in possessing a stronger<br>intention Behavior relationship and it's<br>also they've also been shown to be more<br>empathetic about social issues which<br>could ultimately lead to less consumer<br>food waste additionally trait<br>mindfulness can be considered similar to<br>a skill through repeatedly engaging in<br>mindfulness practice individuals can<br>develop a higher tendency to exhibit<br>mindfulness behavior during the course<br>of their everyday life<br>this would be of particular use to<br>encourage the alignment of intention and<br>behavior among individuals with lower<br>Baseline levels or trade mindfulness<br>in addition to the finding simple<br>regression analysis revealed that for<br>individuals with low levels of trait<br>mindfulness planning shopping and<br>leftover reuse routines with all better<br>predictors of food waste behavior that<br>intention<br>as individuals with low levels of<br>mindfulness have a higher tendency to<br>experience states of Mind driven by<br>predetermined habits it may be valuable<br>to encourage the development of positive<br>food relative routines at a young age<br>through incorporating teachings into<br>educational Educational Systems this<br>would be important to prevent the<br>development of negative food related<br>routines<br>however some people may already have<br>these negative food-related routines<br>developed in which case providing access<br>to mindfulness facilities and to<br>mindfulness Services would be very<br>important for these individuals to break<br>the negative Loop so although the study<br>under identifies some promising results<br>it should be considered that it was<br>cross-sectional in nature which impacts<br>the generalizability of findings<br>nonetheless it provides momentum to<br>support future Research into the<br>connection between mindfulness and food<br>waste in the Endeavor of decreasing<br>consumer food waste quantities thank you<br>very much for listening and if you'd<br>like to know anything else about the<br>thesis please don't
