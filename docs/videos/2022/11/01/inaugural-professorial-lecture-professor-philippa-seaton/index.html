be upstanding for the<br>I'll probably get it all wrong<br>what does it mean when you promise<br>someone but no matter how hard or<br>whatever may come it means that I won't<br>give in<br>won't give in<br>it<br>so I'm just going to offer two things<br>before I invite the vice cancer up but<br>first is to say a very Happy Diwali to<br>everyone the valley is a very important<br>time in the year it's a time to think<br>about light and taking ourselves from<br>ignorance to knowledge and I think<br>that's a really lovely way to place<br>Philippines lecture today and the second<br>thing I wanted to do was offer a kind of<br>care for us all to come together<br>the color care I'm going to use is a<br>story of the Waka takatimu as it passes<br>through a Westerly wind then a southerly<br>wind into a place of calm and quiet<br>and what it's telling us is that if<br>we're together and if we're built well<br>together we can get through storms and<br>reach places where we can create<br>um and<br>learn and have new knowledge<br>um<br>and with that I'd like to introduce uh<br>Vice Chancellor Professor David Murdock<br>to start the sentence thank you very<br>much<br>welcome everybody I usually start by<br>saying for those who don't know me my<br>name is David Murdock and I'm the vice<br>Chancellor but it always feels a bit<br>awkward here that so many people know me<br>but it is it is absolutely wonderful<br>being here today and it's my job to<br>welcome you also welcome you all to the<br>celebration of Philippa seton's<br>promotion to Professor this wonderful<br>day<br>um it's become a bit of a a byline<br>because we've had quite a few inaugural<br>professorial lectures this year to say<br>that this is actually one of the great<br>pleasures of my job is has been part of<br>them and it really is being able to hear<br>our wonderful academics from all over<br>the university and my background as you<br>you know is in Health Sciences and<br>taking on the vice Chancellor role<br>earlier this year being able to hear<br>people from all around the campus is our<br>campus has has been wonderful and<br>hearing a lot of learning a lot about<br>everybody who's spoken things we didn't<br>know before and of course the topic<br>areas have been absolutely fascinating<br>so but particularly<br>Keen to be here today<br>um the two there's another enable<br>Professor a lecture later today Tim is<br>is up at the back and for me very<br>personal as I was Dean when I supported<br>both applications so absolutely I<br>wouldn't have missed today for anything<br>um<br>as you know also we're on a bit of a<br>catch-up at the moment because of code<br>of disrupting a lot of our inaugural<br>profits or lectures and it's really been<br>great to get back into the swing of<br>things at the moment really on on a<br>catch-up<br>my role is mainly to welcome you all<br>here and so a big welcome from the<br>university community from The Wider<br>Christchurch community and and probably<br>Beyond to those who are here in person<br>and those are online and and I know that<br>there'll be many people watching either<br>live or delayed online as well so<br>welcome to you all but I do want to<br>give a special welcome some special<br>guests here today and I suspect other<br>people sitting in the front row the<br>philippa's uh whanau Focus husband<br>Rennie hi Rennie<br>son Robbie<br>and brother-in-law James<br>and I understand her other family who<br>are joining online it's a big big<br>welcome and it's really special helping<br>you here today<br>um<br>sus is going to give a bit more detail<br>about philippa's career but I do before<br>I hand over to Susan do you just want to<br>make a few personal comments I have had<br>the pleasure of really following the<br>center of a postgraduate nursing studies<br>for I guess a last portion of his life<br>in terms of being part of this campus at<br>a time when it was probably I started<br>shortly after it had started and that's<br>following the journey along the way<br>from being roughly Small Small<br>Beginnings to<br>certainly at the moment I think it's had<br>probably the biggest growth in student<br>numbers of any part of the university<br>and I think perhaps over the last year<br>it's had the the greatest increase of<br>any unit within the whole university and<br>that's that's quite a significant change<br>over many years and and I know Philippa<br>will be<br>acknowledging a lot of people have been<br>responsible for this but I do want to<br>acknowledge philippa's personal<br>contribution which has been huge and<br>here leadership has been absolutely<br>phenomenal and I was able to watch that<br>firsthand for many years<br>but it's uh for the the current<br>situation of nursing which is our<br>nursing footprint for the University<br>here based in Christchurch uh you you<br>have a lot of successes has has been uh<br>because of your efforts and your<br>leadership<br>and I've said many times that Philip is<br>one of the most networked people I know<br>and networked in a really positive<br>constructive way I mean in terms of<br>engaging and forming very positive<br>collaborations and what is often a<br>fairly crowded and competitive space<br>it's nursing and Philip are really has a<br>huge reputation at working<br>collaboratively within across the sector<br>and thus I do want to acknowledge that<br>as well<br>so big congratulations so well deserved<br>I'm really really thrilled to be here uh<br>and uh I just look forward to your<br>lecture and I'd now like to hand over to<br>Peter Madness to give a bit more<br>background to your career so then I go<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>woman<br>um who was<br>advocating for the safety of people<br>coming onto her land and she said those<br>very famous Words which I've just shared<br>with you and many people have translated<br>it to say what is the most important<br>thing it is people it is people it is<br>people but actually the true meaning<br>behind those words weren't about us as<br>individual people but actually was uh<br>meeting Idol talking about the<br>importance of as we impact one person we<br>impact their whole network whether it's<br>through their whakapapa or or their<br>system or their culture whatever they're<br>involved in and Philippa is<br>currently in my role as Dean but<br>actually I remember your first day here<br>tahi and have been able to watch you<br>come in as the new shoot of the harakiki<br>and quickly not to strengthen the<br>harakiki bush that you're in but<br>actually tend to to the whole par which<br>is our Center for Nursing and I'm<br>grateful that Marie and I kind of<br>co-wrote this in a way that Marie's done<br>some research about what your peers<br>think of you and I thought what better<br>bio to give because we all know Philippa<br>that's why we're here but what better<br>bio to give than the words of her<br>colleagues so thank you Marie for doing<br>this<br>nothing's dodgy I have been to it so<br>under Philip her leadership and the<br>department has experienced exponential<br>growth evidenced by a number of programs<br>we offer increased number of student<br>enrollments in academic and clinical<br>staff appointments<br>she has demonstrated how to guide a<br>diverse team provide them with<br>opportunities to develop their strengths<br>and progress their career while also<br>ensuring that their contribution is<br>acknowledged and valued a key strength<br>developers is her drive to always seek<br>to understand the facts of the situation<br>at hand and when appropriate solicit<br>advice and consult with others<br>internally and externally to the<br>university to promote ongoing quality<br>standards within the programs<br>since your appointment to Hod she's<br>developed strong sector collaborations<br>this is directly related to her academic<br>integrity and professional standing<br>her approach to the staff is always<br>respectful inclusive and Equitable this<br>has resulted in a strong cohesive team<br>who has worked together to deliver these<br>programs of study with over 550<br>postgraduate students<br>Philippa is a wonderful supportive<br>leader and boss she's a boss girl she's<br>awesome<br>Philippa is approachable skilled and<br>most importantly is genuinely caring<br>Philippa is someone who encourages and<br>leads by example Philippa is exceedingly<br>supportive and kind and always has an<br>open door and make time and makes time<br>for her team and star<br>Philippa has driven supportive and<br>supported the expansion of the<br>department doubling student enrollment<br>in recent years and the development of<br>the new degree<br>Philippa is Forward Thinking in her<br>direction of the department leading and<br>supporting developments<br>Philippa appreciates the big picture in<br>the Long View in a way that leads to<br>collaboration over rivalry and also<br>leads our app to a rather useful trait<br>of not speaking hastily but being<br>considered and measured<br>Philippa I see whose strength is an<br>educator she's very skillful in<br>particular and who research methodology<br>and methods instruction in a so student<br>focused<br>I like this one she is the best boss<br>I've had<br>she is professional open-minded and<br>student in research Focus<br>Philippa you are a tonga and it's a<br>great privilege that I have using the<br>voice of your team to introduce you to<br>tanakoto katoa<br>1885<br>foreign<br>thank you and thank you for the<br>um<br>it's amazing to have everybody here and<br>everybody that's online that I can't see<br>thank you for being here and listening<br>because<br>what I want to talk about today is about<br>nursing<br>and so I've called this nursing and<br>ambition<br>I'm feeling very happy that this is 19<br>and this actually is the year as the<br>nurse educator<br>how better could they have done than<br>that having having this lecture coming<br>for me then<br>but I do just want to hark back to 1922.<br>um when otago first had an ambition for<br>nursing so the first nurses were<br>registered in New Zealand in 1901 we<br>were the first in the world to actually<br>do that<br>but by 1922 the university Council was<br>actually thinking about having nursing<br>prior to that that they'd been in<br>hospitals<br>um and they very ambitiously said a<br>curriculum will be two years of<br>University work two years of Ward work<br>and Hospital training and then a final<br>year of specialized Nursing education<br>and in that final year there could also<br>be registered nurses people who are<br>ready nurses from other programs come in<br>and do Advanced specialist practice like<br>we do in postgraduate nursing<br>so that was a very exciting time for<br>them and they got it started and<br>unfortunately<br>a year before the first people came out<br>of the program<br>they were through the funding<br>and nursing kind of fell over at that<br>point but<br>there was a nurse who graduated in 1930<br>and could I just give my thanks to um<br>the nurse's son who actually missed Bob<br>penty who donated all his mother's<br>nursing documents to the Hawking<br>collection and I think he's captured<br>something really important about nursing<br>at otago that actually we do go back so<br>far as that<br>and this was Winifred Fraser who was the<br>nurse who graduated and um<br>the other nurses went off to Victoria<br>and finished there<br>however this is her diploma that she<br>actually got from<br>otago University<br>so it was an important start for nursing<br>at otago and whilst it didn't kind of<br>carry on at that point<br>so I'd like to talk a little now about<br>the um<br>programs that we have in the center for<br>postgraduate nursing studies<br>but I'd really like to mention some<br>important people at that time at all the<br>staff I'm getting to that<br>the people that came before me now I<br>know there's a lot of people a lot<br>further back than that<br>but there was three people who did have<br>quite an influence on me and<br>Marie Crow is here today and she's<br>actually the first Professor that was a<br>nurse here so<br>um<br>that was incredibly valuable to us and<br>the generosity and help that and support<br>that you've given Marie is incredibly<br>valuable to the department she still<br>does work a little bit for us<br>um but in that little bit contributes a<br>huge amount so I want to say the thanks<br>from nurse and to you for that<br>and Dr Bev Barrel I see you sitting<br>there<br>Bev was the head of Department before me<br>and was still in the department when I<br>came<br>and again the the support and the<br>leadership to the department that you<br>gave was incredibly important you know<br>I'm I'm only caring on the journey from<br>what other people have actually<br>contributed and my thanks to you because<br>that was a lot of guidance went on there<br>and and growing the earlier programs<br>and Lisa Whitehead was the other person<br>she has left the university and gone to<br>work in Australia now but equally she<br>had an amazing research capacity and<br>started the path of research within<br>postgraduate nursing and I think that<br>was a really important<br>uh step for us to be taking so<br>from those people you know I I picked up<br>where they'd started uh to carry on and<br>it was an interesting thing because I<br>came from outside of otago University so<br>um<br>I<br>came with a very fresh<br>view of what it could be and could see<br>many opportunities of what otago could<br>so it was in 1997 they<br>um<br>the center actually finally started<br>having having not um<br>been going for some years<br>and it was a solely Postgraduate School<br>at that time and it was all<br>post-registration postgraduate which was<br>an important thing for nursing at that<br>time previously everybody had gone to<br>Wellington if there was any post<br>registration ongoing learning to do and<br>so I think that was really important for<br>taiwai punama in the South Island to<br>actually have somebody here<br>so the programs that they were offering<br>were including the master of Health<br>Sciences which is in nursing and the<br>development of the master of Health<br>Sciences and nursing clinical and these<br>were the programs for nurses who were<br>going to go on and there wasn't a really<br>important contribution to nursing<br>because it developed as that special<br>specialist skill and Specialty practice<br>for nurses and the the clinical degree<br>actually allowed for the nurse<br>practitioners to start their program as<br>well and so it was that whole new scope<br>of practice<br>and it's really<br>shows the importance of the Educators<br>who work with those nurses because the<br>end point of all this is what difference<br>it's going to make in clinical in<br>developing health care and developing<br>so<br>we do have large numbers of students<br>come from all over the South Island into<br>those programs and it's Partnerships<br>with our clinical providers<br>that are a really important thing to us<br>the collaborations that we have that<br>make a difference<br>um in these programs<br>so more recently the nurse practitioner<br>programs have developed into the master<br>advanced nursing practice so<br>their separate scope of practice now has<br>a degree of its own<br>and again it's a really important<br>progression for nursing<br>you know when we look where nursing has<br>come from in that time in hospitals<br>where nurses did really great things I<br>have to say that was me 47 years ago<br>working in Christchurch hospital here<br>starched apron<br>but nursing's gone a long way now and<br>what they actually provide and practice<br>these degrees are really important<br>demonstration of what they bring to<br>clinical and to Health Care<br>so we are now working with a number of<br>other universities in in the nurse<br>practitioner training program and that's<br>another great part of collaboration I<br>think nursing's like that you know when<br>you're talking about<br>the networks and that that I have that's<br>because nursing's like that<br>um not quite as somebody asked me<br>whether I knew every nurse in New<br>Zealand I don't but I do know quite a<br>few of them<br>and that's what makes us able to do<br>these things that are important for<br>clinical practice so we we work with<br>Auckland and Victoria University in the<br>nurse practitioner training program to<br>try and develop further the nurses that<br>we actually need out there looking after<br>people in areas where perhaps they're in<br>rural areas or you know care is<br>absolutely needed<br>nurse practitioners make a huge<br>so you can see I have many interesting<br>parts<br>in my job<br>the other<br>program that we offer in postgraduate<br>nursing is the master of nursing science<br>and this we developed this around the<br>time I started at otago University and<br>this was the first ever graduate entry<br>pre-registration program in the country<br>and<br>a huge<br>um congratulations to the team from our<br>department that actually developed us<br>because this this was an enormous thing<br>to develop they had to change the<br>nursing Council was changing the<br>regulations it was legislation that<br>needed to be changed to even let this<br>happen<br>so everybody's hard work and the<br>leadership that Dr Virginia Jones<br>and her team showed in this has been an<br>amazing thing for this<br>and continues to go on because I know<br>every single one of you that teaches in<br>this program is doing an amazing job<br>with those students<br>so that was a pretty exciting thing<br>because that changed nursing in New<br>Zealand to give this other group of<br>people who could come in with with a<br>degree already and bring the skills and<br>the life experiences and everything they<br>had to contribute something to nursing<br>and they tend to be a group of students<br>who's incredibly committed to what<br>they're doing because they have made<br>that decision so it's it's very exciting<br>to be involved with that program<br>so 90 odd years after otago's first go<br>at it we did get a program that actually<br>trains nurses to be registered so<br>I think we have done we have done well<br>there<br>um and there's six other programs doing<br>that now so that is giving good numbers<br>of students coming out there into<br>so the other thing we have been doing is<br>around International initiatives<br>it's a really<br>difficult time for nursing at the moment<br>internationally well Healthcare let me<br>not just say nursing here Health Care is<br>an incredibly<br>difficult circumstances at the moment<br>and I think one of the important things<br>we need to do with that is build our<br>International collaborations<br>because<br>nursing is global it is not just where<br>we're sitting here and like it is<br>important the people that we look after<br>close to us but it's also nursing's<br>reach goes far beyond that and we can do<br>many things that can help make Global<br>contributions so we're building<br>relationships internationally<br>covert hasn't actually helped that a<br>whole lot but<br>that's made the situation even more dire<br>in a lot of places but we're working<br>with where we can the other thing that<br>we're currently doing at the moment is<br>working with the national league for<br>nursing in the United States to gain<br>accreditation from them about our<br>program because through that we can also<br>make a greater Global contribution with<br>people doing things with us who can then<br>go and work in other areas and bring a<br>contribution for that<br>so<br>there's many people to hold hands with<br>out there<br>one of the other groups that we do a lot<br>of work with is The Graduate entry<br>nursing International Network and they<br>are here Australia the UK would be the<br>largest number of members they have but<br>it is an international Network all<br>around the entire world<br>and what they're we're trying to do<br>through that group is actually sharing<br>research and educational Innovations<br>about graduate entry pre-registration<br>programs so that we can develop the<br>programs further and maximize what those<br>graduates can actually do in the Health<br>Care system because the end point is<br>so it's a website there if anybody wants<br>so collaborating with others for Better<br>Health Care it's a really great thing<br>working at otago University and when I'm<br>talking about otago I am not just men in<br>Christchurch we are predominantly here<br>and Christchurch has been hugely<br>supportive of nursing but actually our<br>nurses are across the south island and<br>we do have staff who sit in Dunedin and<br>we have a little Hub down there<br>but our reach is everywhere it's to the<br>West Coast down into the southern region<br>in South Canterbury Nelson Marlborough<br>our nurses are everywhere<br>so who are the partners that I'd really<br>we would never be building this future<br>nursing Workforce without the<br>collaborations with health care that<br>education has<br>I am very committed to education I've<br>been an educator for I did work this one<br>out 37 years now it's changed a lot over<br>that time and I can still see there's<br>lots of opportunities to do but all the<br>best things that have ever happened have<br>been because their collaborations with<br>our clinical partners<br>and<br>we have amazing clinical Partners if<br>you're here or if you're online<br>can I just say how much we appreciate<br>what you do for nursing education<br>because to fatal order in Canterbury<br>South Canterbury otago and Southland the<br>west coast and Nelson Marlborough all<br>work incredibly closely with us I'm very<br>fortunate that I have roles within my<br>work where I<br>um<br>and part of the Council of deans of<br>Nursing and Midwifery across Australia<br>and New Zealand and sit on the executive<br>group for that but what that actually<br>allows to happen is these closer<br>collaborations that we have because the<br>nurse Executives of the South Island<br>invite me to all their meetings so that<br>we're working together<br>um on what's good for nursing and I just<br>think they're amazing Partners to have<br>the directors of nursing you know I<br>constantly meet with the directors of<br>nursing so that we together can do<br>what's good for nursing and for patients<br>Primary Health Care organizations<br>Pegasus works very closely with us and I<br>have to say a big thank you to all the<br>leaders of these groups they all sit on<br>our Advisory Board and actually help us<br>keep our<br>um<br>Direction where it needs to go and I<br>think that's an amazing way of working<br>together<br>um<br>Community organizations nurse Maude has<br>worked very closely with us for a lot of<br>years and I'll talk about more in<br>research about that too because again<br>it's people partnering with us that make<br>the difference<br>there's ngos that work with the Stars<br>Donald Beasley Institute in Dunedin<br>Works closely with some of our academics<br>down there<br>and the rural Healthcare organizations<br>and we have been doing a lot of work in<br>ashburton with tafata water down there<br>and<br>we will keep trying to get more students<br>too so you can have more more nurses out<br>there<br>but I also want to acknowledge our<br>partners in nursing education because<br>the educational providers in New Zealand<br>are incredibly good because well<br>especially us we're lucky we have to I<br>put a move for ourselves but<br>um the<br>Council of deans of Nursing and<br>Midwifery who work across all the<br>universities<br>it is collaborative I would have to say<br>it is not a competitive where<br>everybody's trying to<br>work against each other<br>we have really good collaborations with<br>them so Victoria University in<br>Wellington we have close colleagues<br>there and they<br>um<br>link with us and we have research plans<br>with them the University of Auckland as<br>I've said we already had close<br>relationships with them Auckland<br>University of Technology works with us<br>as does Messi and the newly established<br>nursing program in waikato will probably<br>be you know a future partner and things<br>University of Canterbury has always<br>worked quite closely in their Health<br>Sciences and they<br>I have nurses over there and programs<br>and they have a program with typical<br>king or anara and so they're part of<br>that group too of the different ways<br>that we can work towards nursing<br>and probably the other very close<br>educational uh<br>collaboration we have is with the<br>University of Melbourne who have been<br>partners with us for the entire time of<br>our graduate entry program they were<br>very early with The Graduate entry<br>programs in Australia so<br>everybody can<br>research develop and do things better<br>for nursings generally if we work<br>together<br>and the generosity of all these people I<br>think if there's if there's two things<br>that I'd say<br>are the most noticeable thing to me in<br>the time I've been in this role it's<br>about opportunities and the things that<br>have come up if you just notice there's<br>a possibility there<br>we've had some amazing opportunities but<br>I think an incredibly important thing<br>has been the generosity of people<br>that they want to work with you and<br>they want to have that Network and when<br>I appear on their doorstep they are so<br>willing that I think<br>so also we have academic collaborations<br>within the University of otago and<br>this is something that I<br>I'm always saying to my colleagues and<br>other in other places you know like<br>otago is wonderful for that if people<br>are saying well it's really hard to get<br>you know partners and other disciplines<br>and professions that has never been the<br>case at otago maybe I'm just pushy when<br>I go to people's doors but it is<br>incredibly generous the way people have<br>have worked with us many of the<br>departments in the medical school<br>through Dunedin Christchurch and<br>Wellington have worked with nursing on<br>projects<br>may hear the merry indigenous Health<br>Institute have helped us from day one of<br>our programs with the master of nursing<br>science particularly and helping us as a<br>department<br>was how old Amari and knowing how to<br>integrate that into our programs and do<br>a better job with that<br>the Simulation Center I have to say<br>thank you to that because we're down at<br>your place every week and<br>it's wonderful to be able to work so<br>closely with you in in bringing to<br>nursing What nursing needs in this<br>modern world<br>the interprofessional education program<br>has been really important so we're<br>working across otago<br>in developing the all the ipe things but<br>we also work Beyond otago into the<br>health sector where we're doing<br>interprofessional education it's a group<br>of people I work with and doing that<br>the Pacific Center and the associate<br>Dean Pacific has been very helpful in in<br>guiding Us in terms of how we need to be<br>responsive to the needs of Pacific<br>students and the populations that they<br>serve<br>population health<br>our thanks to them they do a lot of<br>research with us and actually they've<br>been doing research for us to some of<br>our programs where we've needed a step<br>away to be able to look at the programs<br>Lee Thompson and population Health was<br>incredibly helpful working with us on<br>that but we have common interests with<br>them so it's fantastic<br>and I have to say pathology and<br>biomedical Sciences are really good at<br>working with us we do have a scientist<br>with us in nursing which is absolutely<br>wonderful and adds things to us but some<br>of our research we do with<br>that we're doing with nurse molds as<br>well is with people out of pathology and<br>biomedical Sciences<br>um but always there is such a<br>willingness to work with us it's<br>it's amazing School of physiotherapy has<br>worked with us nurses and physios we<br>always have something in common to get<br>on with there<br>and I have to say a special thanks to<br>the dean's Department across every day<br>that I've<br>I have worked with here<br>never for one minute<br>does it feel like nursing isn't you know<br>a partner in everything that goes on at<br>uoc<br>however I do have to say thank you to<br>our Deans and our vice Chancellor now<br>they do recognize nursing's needs as<br>well because they're not always just the<br>same as everybody else's but it's that<br>inclusive you know saying that it's just<br>incredibly helpful so<br>that's<br>so<br>nursing research<br>I will try not to talk too long<br>the nursing research that we undertake<br>is really important at this time<br>but if we look back to where we started<br>I had to bring Florence Nightingale in<br>here somewhere<br>um<br>the lady with the lamp<br>the most interesting thing about<br>Florence Nightingale to me wasn't the<br>putting the hands on the fevered brows<br>it was the fact that the nurse with the<br>lamp was shining a light on research and<br>statistics and I think this is something<br>that's gone really unnoticed in her<br>career<br>and since then because she was actually<br>the first woman member of the royal<br>statistical Society<br>and her work in Crimea actually made a<br>huge difference to the use of Statistics<br>in health care and she was the first<br>person to do it<br>so<br>she did get tied up with the hands on<br>the fevered Brows for a lot of years but<br>I think to bring it back to her research<br>contributions is a really great thing<br>for nursing she developed these<br>Innovative nobody had done kind of<br>research diagrams statistical things<br>like this<br>so she did a whole lot of that and it<br>made a huge difference to how they how<br>nursing addressed what they needed to do<br>to nurse people in difficult situations<br>um<br>so what are we doing in the center for<br>important for me is the fact that the<br>overall focus of all the research in our<br>Center is about undertaking projects<br>with high translation to practice value<br>and clinical impact<br>because for me that's what educators are<br>actually there for and researchers are<br>there for<br>to translate that<br>so we do other things we have some very<br>skilled researchers<br>but this is what my focus is about this<br>so we do this through the research that<br>our staff undertake<br>the research that our partners<br>collaborate with us with our staff and<br>that we do with other health disciplines<br>and that's all an incredibly important<br>thing<br>the other thing I would like to mention<br>here is the projects that the students<br>do because we have pre and post<br>registration students who all have to do<br>a project varying from a 30 point<br>once semester kind of project into phds<br>down the line<br>but everybody does either a project a<br>dissertation or a thesis<br>and I think that's such a fundamental<br>basis for nurses to think about evidence<br>for practice and what they'll do out in<br>practice that they actually have to do<br>it with us so it's<br>I'd like to mention<br>people make a big difference when you do<br>nursing research well they did for me<br>anyway there was two people that made a<br>huge difference for me<br>and taught me in some ways what I would<br>hope to Aspire to as a nurse an educator<br>and a researcher Nancy diekerman who<br>probably any nurse in this room will<br>actually know who she is because she was<br>incredibly famous nurse educator who<br>wrote all sort of seminal books about<br>how we should do it<br>I went to a talk of hers once at a<br>conference and I went up to her after<br>that's absolutely amazing it works<br>wonderful and<br>I would like to do something and my<br>Master's thesis I'm going to do<br>something about your work and she took<br>me on as a student she said I'll<br>supervise you so she did this in her own<br>time from the United States when I was<br>actually studying here<br>and was just the most amazing person<br>of teaching me about what education<br>means and what nursing research means<br>and that stayed with me my entire life I<br>did a whole lot of postdoc stuff with<br>her as well and she's<br>brilliant news the other person was<br>there McMurray who I went and did my PhD<br>with in Australia so I left the country<br>and went to Australia<br>um and she was pretty much the same she<br>was just all about what is this<br>contribution to nursing and<br>amazing researcher and actually still is<br>still there researching and they were<br>both amazing academics who were<br>interested in education so I found my<br>perfect Niche really and they<br>they were the people that gave me a<br>starting point<br>so<br>we've developed it from there to have<br>quite a lot of research partners that we<br>do actually work with and I'm not<br>claiming all these research partners for<br>myself it's our department people you<br>see sitting out in front of us here who<br>work with all these people and I'm just<br>fortunate to be on a lot of the projects<br>with them<br>so University of Melbourne is a core<br>research partner of ours<br>I belong to a group called the education<br>simulation and patient safety<br>collaborative because again it's this<br>thing about patients being the airport<br>end point<br>the patient's safety for nursing<br>students collaborative is another group<br>of Australian colleagues that I work<br>with<br>we research with the Council of deans of<br>nursing obviously and the australasian<br>collaboration for benchmarking and<br>educational research for graduate entry<br>programs<br>the Fatal order are good research<br>partners of ours nurse Maude Center for<br>referee radical research and population<br>health<br>so the education simulation and patient<br>safety collaborative actually<br>specifically look about patient outcomes<br>that's what we're researching<br>they're all Educators as you can see<br>some of them are<br>in high positions and the universities<br>they work in but it's about advancing<br>scholarship and looking at that impact<br>of the educational initiatives so these<br>are some of the projects that we've done<br>I've just used an example of things<br>looking at patient safety through<br>simulation and I think this stuff's<br>becoming even more important now when<br>the clinical placements are incredibly<br>uh<br>difficult<br>because it's hard life out there and<br>clinical so how can we supplement that<br>how can we have the nurse nursing<br>students coming out who are ready for<br>practice in a way that is helpful is<br>what some of these projects are looking<br>at<br>so we've done a project around what's<br>the gold standard of simulation if<br>you're going to substitute it for<br>clinical practice and this is highly<br>relevant at the moment with the nursing<br>Council actually looking at what<br>clinical hours students are going to<br>have and they're reviewing it<br>and then looking at the Contemporary<br>patient safety priorities and how<br>simulation fits with that<br>and again at clinical placements<br>so<br>the trans-tasman agreements mean that<br>things we do across<br>New Zealand and Australia are very<br>valuable to both countries so it's it's<br>good to be able to have that influence<br>there<br>the patient safety for nursing students<br>was a project that was led by um Tracy<br>Levick Jones in Australia and what that<br>has done is developed a website for<br>nursing students it's an amazing website<br>if you ever want to go and look at it<br>and<br>it outlines things for students to<br>understand patient safety because that's<br>one of the biggest problems in the<br>Health Care system is things going wrong<br>and we need to prepare students for<br>going out into a system like that that<br>they know what to do so this has been<br>very useful and I think given 2022 as<br>the World Health organization's Global<br>patient safety challenge year<br>that's their theme for this year and<br>looking at medication safety and such<br>things it's<br>the more we can do with nursing students<br>to have them ready to go out into<br>some of the projects we're doing with<br>um<br>Chris Moyer in our department has been<br>leading the project around pressure<br>injury prevention link news and the that<br>role Within<br>so again it's how we can help clinical<br>practice with what we're doing another<br>project I've done was the nursing<br>perspectives of a new sensitive<br>indicators so what are the things nurses<br>do that might make a difference to the<br>outcomes for patients<br>and currently we're in partnership with<br>ashburton Hospital on researching for<br>nursing there<br>so<br>I have to say a lot of the research that<br>I actually do<br>is the behind the scenes stuff<br>how do we prepare people how do we have<br>them ready<br>um<br>I don't make big discoveries about<br>things or invent stuff<br>but to me it's the underpinnings of it<br>that that is important in how we hold<br>nurse Maude have been<br>wonderful partners with us for quite a<br>few years now certainly over the whole<br>time that I have been in the center for<br>postgraduate nursing and probably before<br>that<br>um as research partners and Community<br>nursing Services they've worked very<br>closely with us so a recent project that<br>we've done with them it was about<br>looking at quality indicators for the<br>community-based wound care<br>Center so all of this is to help<br>progress nursing<br>um the other thing that we've partnered<br>with Nismo to do a lot is the summer<br>student ships and<br>my great thanks to nurse Moore's<br>organization who has supported this<br>every year and<br>given the students projects to do<br>that are important clinical projects as<br>you'll see from looking at that you know<br>compression bandaging in the community<br>models of care for Home Care Nursing<br>clinical deterioration in the community<br>nursing management and the prevalence of<br>wounds really important projects to do<br>the other thing I love about these<br>summer student ships is<br>we take all sorts of students they<br>aren't necessarily in fact they're most<br>often not nursing students doing these<br>because at the time of year they are but<br>we've managed to bring a whole lot of<br>medical students and students from other<br>professions and to do these projects<br>under the supervision of nursing working<br>with nurse mode and nursing and I think<br>that's a great interprofessional thing<br>and the value to those students that<br>they've seen when they come back and<br>like what those nurses are doing that's<br>you know absolutely amazing so I think<br>we're developing Healthcare<br>Professionals in a really good way in<br>doing this and getting them thinking<br>about research and seeing where evidence<br>goes for practice that does make a<br>difference<br>the other<br>group that we're working with is a<br>collaboration of educational researchers<br>so we've been looking at the quality<br>standards for practice and working with<br>universities right across Australia and<br>Melbourne's been leading that with us so<br>again we're we're just developing that<br>Council of Deans researchers starting to<br>do some nursing Workforce research now<br>and that's going to be<br>very important in the coming days with<br>such a shortage of nurses that we have<br>how we can actually build that nurse and<br>Workforce<br>and I'd like to acknowledge some of the<br>studies we've done with our other<br>colleagues so<br>opportunities the other things nursing<br>research isn't it you need to be<br>responsive at the time something's<br>needed so population Health worked with<br>us in terms of covert 19. during that<br>time so it wasn't a project we took 10<br>years planning and got all the funding<br>for it was what do we need to look at at<br>this point in time with nursing working<br>under circumstances it was during the<br>pandemic and they have flow-on effects<br>those projects<br>I'd really like to acknowledge my<br>interprofessional education work that<br>I'm doing with Maggie mix and Heather<br>Johnson and Kay Mulligan and<br>Dale Sheehan there's a couple of<br>projects going on there<br>and that's bringing together Canterbury<br>University<br>order<br>our department Ara<br>and working together about what we need<br>to do for our interprofessional<br>education for health professionals<br>we've had some fascinating projects with<br>that look at Telehealth and working with<br>the med students and the nurses<br>and then there was a clinical learning<br>environment project that I was fortunate<br>to be involved with as well and I think<br>that clinical focus on those learning<br>environments was a really important<br>so you can see we do all sorts of stuff<br>it's just as well I didn't put them all<br>in there I would be here a while<br>but to give you an idea of what we<br>actually<br>how we work with our partners<br>the other thing I think is really<br>important is our student research as a<br>postgraduate department so we have<br>significant numbers of students<br>the VC mentioned<br>research projects dissertation of Theses<br>we have PhD students doing things these<br>people are all registered nurses or<br>nurse practitioners or graduates who<br>will become nurses and the important<br>contributions they're going to make to<br>clinical practice<br>really underpins<br>what we do with these students and the<br>commitments of our staff in supervising<br>these students because we have vast<br>numbers of students in any given year<br>who will be undertaking projects<br>and this is just an example of you know<br>some of the projects that would go on<br>looking at in-situ simulation and acute<br>care was a project we did in Dunedin<br>we had a PhD student who was looking at<br>the effects of multiple sclerosis so you<br>can see we have quite a lot of different<br>sorts of project<br>and then working with Helen and Helen<br>from the diabetes center we had there<br>was a project around wound Imaging that<br>was part of Helen's degree so as<br>students make immense contributions to<br>I'd like to thank everybody else who<br>works with us who's not part of that<br>academical research world but our<br>department would not actually function<br>without all these other people because<br>we have a complicated sort of students<br>who we need to liaise with the fat Oro<br>and you know Private health care<br>providers and all sorts of things and<br>the service divisions do an amazing job<br>with that of getting people enrolled<br>sorting out their fees and things giving<br>them I.T Services human resources<br>Property Services gives us a spot to set<br>student services supports all the<br>students<br>it's a big place a university and<br>there's lots of people holding hands and<br>I<br>my thanks to them<br>so where did we get to after all that<br>I'm very happy to say that we are ranked<br>in the top 100 nursing schools in the<br>world and have been for the last three<br>years so<br>shows what good staff we have<br>um and that's<br>important to students<br>I didn't specifically ask the dean to<br>introduce that but she knows these<br>things<br>it is the people it is all the people<br>that I work with here that's why I'm<br>standing here doing a professorial<br>lecture it's actually all for you people<br>because<br>you<br>are the important people in this<br>everybody that's been there and our<br>students and this is just our staff that<br>I have the pictures off here<br>you can see how I'm<br>surrounded<br>and supported<br>but everybody that we work within the<br>university is everyone is incredibly<br>important to us<br>so in the year of the nurse educator<br>love this slogan behind great nurses and<br>great Educators and I think that sums up<br>what it's like for us here in taiwai<br>punama<br>that we're right behind the great nurses<br>who work out there<br>so<br>AP<br>stall our academic clinical nursing<br>staff administrative staff clinical<br>Partners everybody that supports nursing<br>that's what this professorial<br>appointment about is about it's about<br>nursing at otago what we do in<br>partnership with others for the good of<br>patients and the nursing profession<br>I should have thanked my family<br>don't do it now thank you to the<br>long-suffering ones who have actually<br>been through that whole journey<br>and<br>to my husband who thinks this never ends<br>and my son who when he was about this<br>big asked me if I'd finished my homework<br>yet I'm not sure I might still be doing<br>I'm Trish priest I'm the acting provides<br>Chancellor of Health Sciences I'm based<br>in Dunedin although I did spend a couple<br>of years here and learning things in<br>this lecture theater a long time ago I<br>wanted to Echo the vice Chancellor in<br>saying that going to the ipl's is one of<br>the great pleasures of my job it's<br>always so interesting to learn something<br>about the amazing people we have working<br>in Health Sciences at otago<br>I my job is to make some comments about<br>the content and significance of the<br>lecture I've got two jobs that's the<br>first one and I just want to start by<br>noting that as far as we're<br>sorry I was told that too and I<br>completely forgot<br>as far as we're aware that that's the<br>first IPO where everybody anybody has<br>thanked the service division itself<br>and I think that is a measure of the<br>kind of person that Philip is<br>um I don't know who well I've been on a<br>number of Zoom called meetings and so on<br>with of various kinds but um<br>the fact that she very rarely said I<br>during that lecture and said we a lot I<br>think says something about the amazingly<br>collaborative and generous person she is<br>um I want I want to start just by<br>talking about a little bit about<br>significance so we all know and covert<br>has broken wide open the<br>importance of nurses the numbers and the<br>scope of practice in the Health Service<br>and so philippa's work is incredibly<br>valuable nationally and internationally<br>because it's contributing to both of<br>those things<br>there's a country you know desperately<br>needs<br>the content I think was so interesting<br>because we have a really good picture of<br>the center for<br>sorry significance postgraduate nursing<br>studies I forgot the postgraduate<br>um and the all of the things that the<br>center does<br>um and it's it's amazing to hear that<br>incredibly kind of um acknowledging<br>others approach that Philippa has but I<br>do just want to correct here slightly<br>and say that the promotion to Professor<br>is actually given to an individual and<br>this is actually about Philippa and her<br>achievements and<br>um and we you know we look at teaching<br>and research and service and it's it's<br>about Philippa this this lecture is is<br>US celebrating purpose promotion she has<br>celebrated everyone she works with and<br>that's absolutely fantastic but I do<br>just want to celebrate Philippa herself<br>and her role in all of that so she<br>talked a bit about how how many amazing<br>opportunities there are for<br>collaboration and how generous people<br>are I just want to say that it takes<br>someone to step into those opportunities<br>and people are often generous to people<br>who are who are good to work with in<br>general specs so it does it speaks to<br>your character and skills and approach<br>that you find those opportunities for<br>collaboration and that they are<br>successful<br>um<br>I've read philippa's CV before coming<br>here and I'm struck by her passion for<br>the nursing Workforce Development and<br>and its success and the<br>um you wouldn't necessarily know but she<br>has done a lot of supervising of<br>students and supervising of projects<br>she's done a lot of marking of other<br>people's projects and so much service to<br>her discipline and to Academia in<br>general that contributes to her success<br>as professor and her talking about her<br>reach both across New Zealand and into<br>International<br>environments is another example of how<br>important it is that someone like<br>Philippa is out there doing that stuff<br>it doesn't just happen it's it's an<br>active process<br>um<br>I<br>it seems to me I'm not a nurse and I'm<br>not totally in that world but that<br>Philip has made an important<br>contribution to nursing as a research<br>underpinned Healthcare discipline<br>um through her leadership and through<br>the programs of teaching and her own<br>research<br>and I think that's really important<br>um<br>as you know as nursing itself progresses<br>and you're an important part of that<br>you're kind of steering the ship from<br>behind in the way that you see it but<br>you're definitely your leadership and<br>your achievements have been really<br>important in there so I'm just going to<br>move on to my second task which is to<br>propose a formal vote of thanks to<br>Philippa for her work for her passion<br>for her career and for her lecture and<br>to congratulate her again on being<br>promoted as a professor<br>foreign<br>it's just a wonderful special occasion<br>so without further Ado can you all be<br>foreign<br>and we'd like to invite you now to join<br>for food and getting together so thank</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
