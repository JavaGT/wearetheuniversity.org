see you here this evening my<br>name is John hosking I'm the dean of<br>science here at the University of<br>Auckland it's my very great pleasure to<br>welcome you both to the university and<br>to the inaugural lecture of Professor<br>Craig Stevens from the physics<br>department<br>Craig specializes in how fluids flow<br>particularly using novel observational<br>techniques to understand how the ocean<br>works for example how turbulent<br>stratification and waves interact create<br>the equivalent of undersea storms and<br>squalls<br>notably his Cookie Monster collaboration<br>with Joe o'callaghan is looking at the<br>flow through Cook Street using Torpedoes<br>and gliders to study ocean mixing<br>this work contributes to global ocean<br>modeling and to our understanding of how<br>nutrients Plastics marine life and<br>vessels are afflicted by affected by<br>unique ocean features<br>the Cook Strait was not enough and<br>because he clearly likes extremes<br>Craig's work has taken him to the<br>Antarctic whereas part of a team that<br>bores holes in the Life shelf to observe<br>ocean mechanics beneath hundreds of<br>meters of ice<br>something here we're talking about<br>tonight<br>Craig May create boreholes but is<br>definitely not boring as he's also a<br>specialist in science communication<br>explaining how the world Works to the<br>layperson<br>he's been shortlisted for the manhire<br>science creative writing competition<br>there's one several niwa photographic<br>and Communications Awards again he will<br>be demonstrating that skill set tonight<br>Craig also has a passion for the state<br>of Science in the country as exemplified<br>by as being a current member of the<br>council and past co-president of the New<br>Zealand Association of scientists<br>Craig started a scientific Journey with<br>the civil engineering degree in Adelaide<br>before heading to Perth to do a PhD at<br>uwa followed by a postdoc at UBC and<br>Camp Vancouver<br>he was lured to New Zealand by niwa and<br>Wellington in 2002 clearly port cities<br>are attractive to Ocean scientists<br>where he still works today as a<br>principal scientist in Marine physics<br>however in 2012 we attracted him to be a<br>co-appointee here in the physics<br>department as a member of the coastal<br>and Marine Science joint graduate school<br>that we in niwa have jointly developed<br>Craig was promoted to professor at the<br>start of this year we celebrate that<br>tonight in his inaugural lecture<br>Craig the floor is yours great thank you<br>no pressure Kira Toto call Mount lofty<br>tarmanga<br>komari River te AWA no Adelaide Ajo<br>Coast Stevens tocophanel Co Craig Toko<br>ingowa<br>and I also want to acknowledge the Ghana<br>people whose lands I grew up in and had<br>been there for somewhere around 40 000<br>years<br>um but I'm part of the Irish diaspora<br>um and this painting<br>um from Sydney Nolan was painted a<br>couple of years before I was born and he<br>too was part of the Irish diaspora and<br>he was invited by the U.S military to<br>travel to Antarctica<br>and he zoomed around for about eight<br>days madly collecting information and<br>then he came back and produced a whole<br>pile of work so I'm sort of using that<br>as an inspiration I go down on quite<br>short trips<br>to measure how the oceans around<br>Antarctica are working and how they're<br>influencing the future of our planet and<br>then I come back and spend a lot of time<br>doing the things that John just listed<br>I have to say<br>constant sort of imposter syndrome all<br>my training was in engineering<br>departments around sort of fluid<br>mechanics and turbulence and if you<br>imagine<br>um a disused Mine Pit covered in ice and<br>then it fills with water that's got all<br>sorts of terrifying chemicals in it this<br>is the sort of background that I come to<br>and so then you you plonk yourself in a<br>physics department and sort of passing<br>yourself off as a climate scientist<br>you're kind of always expecting to be<br>dragged out the door<br>but it turns out my background and skill<br>sets are perfect for the problem that<br>we're going to be dealing with<br>and so looking at the the fate of<br>Antarctic Ice<br>um and I hope you're all sort of settle<br>in because for the next 40 minutes we're<br>just going to look at this chunk of ice<br>here so the Ross ice shelf uh it's<br>around the size of Spain or France<br>depending on where you are on Wikipedia<br>um<br>it itself if it melts doesn't change sea<br>level but when it if it does<br>decline or soften it unleashes meters of<br>sea level rise upon the planet and so<br>there's plenty to be done to try and<br>understand how this system works<br>um but before I get there<br>um have to acknowledge the many many<br>people that make this possible<br>um in the past I've sort of had a list<br>of names and the kind of washes by you<br>and I guess I noticed a few colleagues<br>doing sort of<br>um mug shot Galleries and I think<br>they're awesome<br>a bunch of great people ranging from<br>Engineers that make the operations<br>possible through to overseas<br>collaborators and then the new students<br>coming through with new ideas<br>I will have to say it's it's tough times<br>in science tough times for<br>um well across the board really in terms<br>of being early career or if you're a<br>technician being sort of recognized for<br>your skills and being able to build a<br>career around that<br>so I do encourage you if you if you're<br>at all interested in sort of<br>the career trajectories and the place of<br>Science in Museum New Zealand Society<br>the New Zealand Association of<br>scientists is having a conference in<br>about a month's time it'll be online and<br>in person you might want to check it out<br>anyway<br>you'll be familiar with many versions of<br>trajectories of what Global sea level<br>looks like<br>order of 50 to 80 centimeters over the<br>next the coming Century depending on<br>what sort of emissions programs we<br>managed to extract out of all our<br>um<br>uh the ways we run our societies and our<br>Industries and our ways of life<br>um but often on top you'll see this<br>dashed line around uncertainty around<br>how Antarctica and the Antarctic Ice<br>Sheets<br>um are working and how they will work<br>with a much warmed ocean and so you<br>basically there's the potential for<br>twice as much sea level rise<br>uncertainties are around<br>um actually lots of what I'm going to<br>talk about which are new data and not<br>even factoring into some of the<br>uncertainties that we're seeing here<br>they're too small scale but I'll come to<br>that lots of this uncertainty is around<br>foreign<br>try that again and so the essential<br>problem so this is a slice through half<br>of Antarctica so the ice that sits up on<br>the land is as many kilometers thick uh<br>it's sitting there reasonably happily we<br>have a warming ocean around its margins<br>that's nibbling away and so if you heat<br>that ocean up you nibble away faster and<br>depending on how the ground the sea<br>floor is oriented you get a runaway<br>effect where the more melting that<br>happens from the ocean<br>enables even more melting to happen and<br>so the Marine ice sheet instability is<br>the kind of thing that will give us some<br>of these dramatic increases in sea level<br>globally<br>but if you you know naturally enough the<br>first thing you do when you do research<br>is you go to Google and if you type in<br>um ice shelf cavity circulation you get<br>lots of nice 2D slices through an ocean<br>cavity with lots of nice<br>um straight arrows a couple of those<br>diagrams are mine so I'm not not blaming<br>other people for doing this but but it's<br>a we have quite a simplified View and<br>the kinds of models that give us sea<br>level rise projections<br>encapsulate this sort of level of<br>Simplicity because they have to I guess<br>my the role of our science in this is to<br>sort of unpack some of the complexities<br>that lie Behind These seemingly simple<br>systems<br>and so<br>um<br>just another view of the system that<br>we're looking at the gray area is the<br>Ross ice shelf so this is uh ice that's<br>between 500 and 300 meters thick<br>floating on an ocean that's the same<br>sort of thickness and it's wedged<br>between the West Antarctic and the East<br>Antarctic Ice Sheets<br>paradoxically<br>the West Antarctic ice sheet is in the<br>east<br>and the East is in the West<br>it's because they started from the other<br>side when they started naming these<br>things so the last decade we've been<br>running a program of trying to observe<br>these systems with more than snapshots<br>we've been trying to get in instruments<br>that will record how the ocean is<br>evolving but through time series so<br>um a Time series that would be as long<br>as possible some of these lasted several<br>years some of them are still recording<br>and I guess a shout out to Melissa Barn<br>in the school of the environment the<br>northernmost one is one that she's<br>maintained for the last three or so<br>years<br>um but but so you get a sense that we're<br>trying to build a transect from What's<br>called the grounding line so the<br>grounding line is where the ice sheet<br>leaves the coast and then flows out over<br>the ocean we're trying to get a sense of<br>the the changes the Dynamics the<br>mechanics<br>um at the small scale from that<br>grounding line right through to the open<br>ocean<br>your slice is around 800 kilometers long<br>and it's around 800 to 800 meters to a<br>kilometer uh deep so the aspect ratio as<br>it's the ocean is is thin so essentially<br>you'd have about a 20 meter long if if<br>your cavity was one centimeter High it<br>would be 20 meters long<br>in real scale so it's this tiny little<br>wedge<br>that travels for hundreds of kilometers<br>so the essential story that I'm going to<br>talk about today is we start with a<br>warming ocean out on the right hand side<br>if we warm that what's the story for how<br>it changes the ice melt and for lots of<br>what we're doing we're the first to meet<br>the observations we're making so we're<br>not really capturing the change we're<br>just learning what the what on Earth is<br>um yeah I guess another point is worth<br>making uh<br>around so the loss of fresh water from<br>that ice shelf it's pretty much 50 50<br>split between breaking off in icebergs<br>and through melt on the underside and a<br>little bit from the top side so and<br>those icebergs are breaking off I mean<br>they've always broken off ice shelves<br>have always melted from a change<br>perspective we're trying to work out if<br>things are accelerating and if the ocean<br>is changing in response<br>uh and another point I like to make<br>um is that we had imagery from the<br>surface of Venus before we'd been<br>beneath an ice shelf to look at how the<br>environment worked<br>so 1975 the Soviets got instruments onto<br>the the surface of a planet that's<br>hundreds of degrees warmer than ours<br>massive winds sent back images it was<br>before we'd actually looked in our own<br>um it's quite a nice backyard it's about<br>the flattest view I think is possible to<br>have anywhere on the planet<br>um so this is standing pretty much in<br>smack bang in the middle of the ice<br>shelf rotating around<br>um we've got about 350 meters of ice<br>beneath us and then another 400 meters<br>of ocean and it's it's flat as far as<br>you can see<br>um<br>um<br>it's not always nice one of the the key<br>things for our operations is being able<br>to get shelter and to be able to work in<br>and just to give you a bit more scale so<br>when we drill into these systems so this<br>is I think the highest waterfall in the<br>world<br>in Venezuela it's a bit under a<br>kilometer High<br>so the first 50 or 80 or so meters for<br>us is snow so you're camping on snow so<br>over your sort of one one month or six<br>weeks you're just slowly sinking into<br>the snow<br>then you have to drill through sorry got<br>ahead of myself drill through 300 or so<br>meters of ice<br>and then you get to the from an<br>oceanographer's point of view where all<br>the action is happening the ocean that's<br>beneath this and so you're actually<br>working your way down a 30 centimeter<br>diameter tube to access this system<br>and so you know you have a world that's<br>basically defined by about 30<br>centimeters in the horizontal<br>but you're trying to understand<br>something that stretches 800 kilometers<br>so even more than normal oceanography<br>you're constrained by where your<br>measurements are and how you build up a<br>perspective on how the wider world is<br>operating<br>um so over the past six or so years a<br>combination of the mv's Antarctic<br>science platform and investment from<br>various parties especially Victoria<br>universities<br>um ice drilling team have made it<br>possible to essentially do world-class<br>research on on quite a thin budget<br>um just<br>going to take the opportunity I will<br>look to see if anyone's sleeping<br>foreign<br>this is probably around 40 centimeters<br>diameter this is camera accessing<br>hundreds of meters of ice<br>um<br>over you know your your two or two or so<br>weak intense sampling period you spend a<br>lot of time looking at this kind of<br>video because you're you're dancing a<br>dance between having enough time to get<br>your instruments down these holes to<br>make samples before it freezes up and<br>traps your instruments<br>um<br>you take the instruments out and then<br>pump more heat down so that you can stay<br>there for a couple of weeks but on a<br>day-to-day basis you're doing this sort<br>of dance with<br>um freezing and so the trick is to<br>always have the skinniest instruments<br>because it's the fat ones that will get<br>stuck first<br>so the sorts of Kit we put down these<br>holes pretty straightforward<br>lots of camera setups<br>we measure temperatures and salinities<br>and turbulence and sediment and all that<br>sort of stuff in vertical profiles we<br>also have collaborators from Cornell who<br>brings super fancy<br>um<br>rovs so remotely operated Vehicles so<br>literally a submarine that you can<br>that's skinny you can get it down a hole<br>but then it will drive around<br>um for a couple of kilometers and so<br>um that's that's a whole other that's a<br>whole whole other story I'll leave that<br>to them to tell<br>um and the last thing we do I talked<br>about trying to capture time series in<br>these systems we leave instruments<br>frozen into the ice<br>suspended in in the ocean beneath<br>and then they talk back to us via<br>satellite so you know it's it's a it's a<br>nice sound bite for the media in that we<br>actually get text messages from<br>Antarctica but it is true<br>um so we will you know I could I could<br>tell you what the temperature was at our<br>last field site<br>um uh from from yesterday or something<br>like that the flip side or downside as<br>happened this morning is you also get<br>messages telling you when an instrument<br>has stopped working so you know<br>um so what I've done in the past is I've<br>worked on a kind of a spatial journey in<br>a talk where I've sort of followed the<br>ocean as it works its way through this<br>however we've done about seven or eight<br>experiments now and that story is<br>getting really long<br>and so I've decided to to sort of go a<br>bit orthogonal and I'll just tell you<br>about five cool things from this system<br>that uh things that um no one had seen<br>before or they'd not seen in the way<br>that we'd seen them<br>so<br>first off we'll go to the beach<br>so our beach it's the coast it's the<br>grounding line it's under around 500<br>meters of ice<br>and so this was this January just gone<br>uh we're essentially we were working in<br>what we expected to be a stream or a<br>river flowing<br>from beneath the ice sheet into the<br>ocean and we had a sense from looking at<br>the surface topography that it must have<br>melted a little bit of a sort of a creek<br>or something like that and so we're<br>expecting this sort of nice<br>hemispherical dome<br>which would have fresh water pumping out<br>from beneath the ice sheet and so you<br>know<br>um uh the the surface team had spent<br>three weeks driving there<br>um we'd flown in about 10 people<br>and our first drill through had sort of<br>got about 30 meters past where it should<br>have hit the ocean and so Hugh Horgan<br>who was sort of the pi on the particular<br>experiment was just getting visibly more<br>and more stressed there was the<br>potential that we basically were just<br>going to hit dirt and the oceanographers<br>could go home and would give him a hard<br>time for the rest of his career<br>however at the last sort of possible<br>moment we actually broke through into<br>the ocean or it's actually an estuary<br>um beneath the ice and so this is the<br>camera just popping out beneath the ice<br>um shelf and you can just sort of see<br>dark lumps and stuff that will come back<br>to in a tick and so that's the underside<br>of the ice shelf at a depth of around<br>so we put down an acoustic Sounder an<br>altimeter and um you know<br>um a shout out to Craig Stewart who<br>actually coordinated this instrument on<br>the spot once we realized that the<br>system wasn't how we thought it was and<br>it was worthy of measurement<br>and so this is a one-to-one so I haven't<br>squashed any aspect ratios and so it's<br>this narrow slot through the ice and<br>it's kind of got a um a bulbous top and<br>um took our density profiles the way<br>I've started describing it to people is<br>essentially in a long Cathedral<br>um uh the full Cathedral is about eight<br>kilometers long uh it's about 200 meters<br>wide and about 300 meters high<br>and the ocean is flowing in at the<br>bottom<br>from the pulpit is coming this sort of<br>um that the water that we're really<br>interested in which is the water that's<br>coming out from beneath<br>the ice sheet but the top that sort of<br>bulbous thing that's actually filled<br>with local melt water so the water that<br>we we we expected the stuff that's<br>coming out of the pulpit the the stuff<br>from underneath the ice shell to be<br>sitting at the top but actually there<br>was local melt water that was sitting<br>above that and so that the whole sort of<br>exchange process was three layered<br>um and the other point was it was<br>constantly moving in the tides<br>and so<br>these profiles are around 20 minutes<br>apart<br>and it's showing the the tides sort of<br>slowly pumping the stratification up and<br>down but also getting it to sort of<br>wobble so essentially processes that<br>would lead to mixing try that again<br>and sort of diffusing the the water<br>that's coming out from underneath the<br>ice shelf and so that critical water<br>from underneath the ice shelf is the<br>stuff that's from about 450 to 500<br>meters<br>and it turns out that actually most of<br>the water in this Estuary is salt water<br>most of us see water the flow from<br>underneath the ice shelf is very low and<br>so one of the things that we hope to<br>capture by leaving instruments there to<br>hopefully record and not break down is<br>that we may be able to see sporadic<br>flood events so so sort of freshwater<br>Chambers Upstream might occasionally let<br>down a big burst of water and so so<br>that's one of the things we're hoping to<br>monitor in the in the longer term so<br>some of the first direct observations of<br>melt water info into the cavity<br>the next Point here we're actually<br>sitting in the middle of the ice shelf<br>just pulling up into the hole and it's<br>kind of quick you have to be quick there<br>but there's a whole<br>um the underside of the ice is coated in<br>ice crystals there is seawater<br>refreezing on the underside of the ice<br>shelf<br>not very much<br>and it so so<br>ice shelves can actually<br>reform you can actually have an ice<br>shelf that will melt in one place and<br>re-freeze in another so we certainly<br>understand that that can happen but<br>where we were working was somewhere<br>where it wasn't necessarily expected and<br>it sort of points to the ephemeral<br>nature of a lot of<br>um<br>possible ephemeral nature of the the<br>just yeah<br>and then this is in a different part of<br>the ice shelf and this is from the The<br>Ice fin the robotic crew and this is<br>showing we're looking at about three<br>meters across in this image and so the<br>underside is full of quite substantial<br>ripples uh and lumps and so on<br>um a key point is that the equations for<br>melt of ice in this kind of environment<br>pretty much are assuming it's flat<br>uh and and also<br>um most they're primarily assuming it's<br>smooth so the previous set of imagery is<br>not smooth in that place at that time<br>and then this is from January this is<br>from our Cathedral uh and so this is the<br>extreme where you're actually you've got<br>meter High um bumps and lumps on the<br>underside you've got little patches<br>where there's re-freezing crystals<br>um there's sediment raining out there's<br>all sorts of<br>um stuff happening and so<br>um<br>any melt equations uh uh will struggle<br>to represent this kind of system it's<br>worth reflecting of course though if<br>you're going to be shooting out to do<br>climate projections you're not going to<br>be working at this scale anyway<br>but but it does it does challenge models<br>of the ocean that's at the ice shelf<br>scale<br>so the underside of ice shelves are not<br>always flat<br>if we go into the middle of the cavity<br>and the middle of the water column<br>this is a segment of temperature<br>profiles recorded over a two-week period<br>repeatedly and so<br>um<br>we're 400 kilometers from the open ocean<br>so there's no atmosphere driving<br>anything crazy or we've got are tides<br>and our slow circulation in the middle<br>of the cavity so things should be really<br>quite<br>ordered in terms of temperature<br>structure and salt structure things<br>should be smooth and not varying what we<br>found<br>was that there are lots of layers right<br>in the middle of the water column that<br>would be varying on hour to hour basis<br>and we extrapolate this back to likely<br>being tidal processes<br>rubbing on the underside of some of the<br>variations in the in the ice shelf<br>Underside<br>kicking up these these layering<br>processes and the point is<br>that if you're going to generate a<br>computer model<br>of the ocean circulation in this cavity<br>you're needing to be picking a<br>diffusivity something that will move<br>heat and salt around in the vertical<br>this this sort of structure and so the<br>image I put up on the right hand side is<br>temperature microstructure where we've<br>passed a sensor through this or this<br>crazy layering<br>um uh the microstructure is set up to<br>measure temperature differences every<br>couple of millimeters and so the fact<br>that you have double-sided spikes is<br>telling you that there's turbulence and<br>overturns and so<br>your diffusivity is much enhanced in<br>this kind of system compared to<br>certainly compared to what the computer<br>models are working with and so it<br>certainly requires some rethinking<br>around how the circulation operates in<br>these cavities it's worth keeping in<br>mind that the for the Ross<br>the general circulation time for the<br>whole cavity is several years three<br>three to four years we think and so<br>um<br>small differences in diffusion<br>add up over that period of time<br>I guess the other thing that appears is<br>there are<br>submesoscale mesoscale Eddies so these<br>are sort of horizontal<br>whirling motions if you like maybe at<br>the 10 to 20 kilometer scale and so<br>Ying poo Lee who's a china-based PhD<br>student in the department at the moment<br>hopefully turning up next month has been<br>looking at the current meter data from<br>from the center of the cavity and adding<br>them up to to try and identify the scale<br>of these Eddies because as I showed you<br>in that um Google uh Google search at<br>the start where you've got lots of 2D<br>slices through these systems they're all<br>ignoring the fact that there are<br>potentially Eddie's<br>um circulating within this large cavity<br>and so if you zoom in on the right hand<br>side<br>different colors different depths<br>so the the sort of wobbling backwards<br>and forwards at the small scale are the<br>tides so that's pushing a current<br>backwards and forwards every 24 hours<br>here but then occasionally you'll see<br>some loops and so that's a submesis<br>scale say a a one to ten kilometer<br>diameter Eddy that's come through our<br>observation station and so just another<br>process that is altering the circulation<br>over this sort of two to four year<br>period<br>full of eddies<br>to be fair<br>where the modeling Community is at at<br>the moment is just starting to embrace<br>the reality of this and so just try you<br>know you know it's we know that there<br>are Eddies in the open ocean and so it's<br>understanding how they'll get into the<br>cavity and then persist is and it's<br>that's where where modeling is starting<br>to engage<br>in the past they've not had a lot of<br>data to reflect on for that<br>um we're up to exciting thing number<br>four and this is not physics<br>so we're lowering a camera in the middle<br>of the ice shelf uh the rocks are about<br>five centimeters and you'd get<br>school-aged students very excited to see<br>the first fish move so can you see the<br>fish move right<br>so lots of excitement for very small<br>sort of biological entities<br>and so that's probably a reasonable<br>reflection of about four or five<br>Expeditions like this as we'd see<br>between one and four creatures in many<br>many hours of visual sampling so you can<br>imagine<br>um when we got the out of focus<br>obviously footage from just beneath from<br>the sea floor in this cathedral-like<br>chamber the dots are 10 centimeters<br>apart<br>these are amphipods little shrimpy<br>things<br>but quite a lot of excitement<br>um<br>uh to the extent we actually when we<br>first put the camera down we actually<br>thought we had um we thought it was<br>broken<br>um because it was sort of flickering so<br>much<br>um I will say so so yes it's out of<br>focus thanks for pointing that out<br>um so we thought okay we'll sort that<br>out and we'll go back and we'll get some<br>more imagery so over the the 12-day<br>period that we're able to sample in this<br>system we never saw uh amphipod<br>densities like this again<br>so either the populations are very<br>variable in space and we lucked out or<br>we annoyed them so much that they have<br>not yet come back but again we're 500<br>kilometers from the open ocean where<br>there's access to<br>ecosystem resources at the surface in<br>terms of light and and easy access to<br>oxygen and so you know what's what's<br>driving this population to be so large<br>at this location<br>um uh as I said not physics so so some<br>of the some of the team especially<br>looking around at um egna uh for the<br>nutrients<br>um that these amphipods are feeding on<br>um is hopefully going to explore that<br>issue<br>um but it when talking to the media it<br>does capture<br>the the narrative<br>um and so you know you sort of<br>skillfully have to talk to people about<br>the the hidden creatures<br>um and mention oh by the way the climate<br>issues are quite important as well<br>um<br>but but it does motivate people to get<br>excited about the story but nothing has<br>changed in 40 years<br>um so the the very first uh Expedition<br>beneath the ice shelf<br>um the one that happened just after we'd<br>been to the surface of Venus they too<br>were sort of caught up in the same sort<br>of story as that they were they were<br>primarily there to look at um the the<br>geophysics of the ice shelf and some of<br>the aspects of the oceanography but they<br>did capture a photograph of a fish and<br>so that also caught their story to be<br>fair they had actually baited their<br>camera<br>so<br>um cool thing number five<br>um is not all slowly varying and it's<br>not all predictable so<br>um four days after we put in this first<br>Mooring<br>um the Tongan eruption and tsunami<br>happened and so<br>um we were fortunate enough that our<br>instruments were configured in a way<br>that was able to capture the passage of<br>both the atmospheric wave and then the<br>um the residual of the tsunami as a<br>pressure wave beneath the ice shelf so<br>again 400 kilometers from the open ocean<br>and I guess the remarkable thing from my<br>perspective is that what we're showing<br>here about a day and a half after the<br>arrival of the tsunami<br>but actually<br>um the the ringing the increased<br>amplitude on the right hand side<br>persisted for about four days<br>and so<br>um presumably this part of the corner of<br>the cavity was was just bouncing around<br>um and so uh the tsunami modeling group<br>at gns are looking at these data at the<br>um so just a supplementary cool thing I<br>said there would only be five but<br>um<br>we come to the edge of the ice shelf so<br>this is not the edge of the Ross this is<br>the edge of the Nance and ice shelf<br>which is a little baby one about 400<br>kilometers north of the Ross so the<br>vertical side wall that you're looking<br>at there that's around 20 meters and<br>there's another 80 or so meters beneath<br>this sea surface and you'll see that<br>it's a it's a sharp edge<br>um so there's pretty much nowhere else<br>on the planet<br>um geophysically where you change the<br>ocean depth by a factor of two in the<br>space of order of 10 meters in the<br>horizontal so so the front edge where<br>sort of the the Melt water from beneath<br>the ice shelf exits into the open ocean<br>um<br>goes through a sort of a dramatic change<br>and you you don't see it in this<br>um imagery because this was pleasantly<br>in summer<br>um but this is where uh polinia form and<br>so polinia are where the cold air is<br>blowing off the ice sheet<br>um and it forms new sea ice and when it<br>forms new sea ice it's pumping uh cold<br>salty water into the ocean and you this<br>is uh depending on your perspective this<br>is the birthplace of ocean circulation<br>but uh an interesting aspect is<br>that water that has melted at reasonable<br>pressure<br>if it stays liquid if there's nothing<br>for sort of um to nucleate for ice<br>crystals to form around uh it enters a<br>state called supercooled so it's<br>actually colder than the local pressure<br>dependent freezing point and so it's<br>desperately Keen to freeze it will form<br>crystals either in the open water or on<br>the underside of anything that you can<br>touch on and we saw some of that in the<br>roughened ice shelf Underside earlier on<br>and so<br>around ice shelves the sea ice<br>underneath will be coated in these ice<br>crystals that have formed from the<br>supercooled seawater either the crystals<br>either form directly on the ice<br>Underside or they actually will will<br>form they'll nucleate around something<br>in the water column and then they're<br>largely freshwater ice at that point and<br>they'll rise and join the sea ice from<br>underneath<br>and so you can imagine that the boundary<br>layer beneath that sea ice is quite<br>different to a boundary layer that you'd<br>have with a smooth Underside in<br>so so what<br>um<br>where where we're hoping to continue<br>maintaining this transect going from the<br>grounding line<br>through up into the open ocean and so I<br>won't talk about the activities that are<br>happening out on the open continental<br>shelf but it's it's fair to say that<br>about half our work actually operates<br>out on the continental shelf itself<br>where we're taking this work is yes we<br>want to improve computer models<br>but you know the reality in terms of the<br>time scales of from from climate Futures<br>the time scales to actually understand<br>and get some of these improvements into<br>computer models it's quite challenging<br>to make that happen fast enough<br>however the improved monitoring and so<br>the real-time realization of changes in<br>say the salinity of the ocean around<br>Antarctica or the changes in the<br>stratification near the uh<br>ocean surface and how that might<br>influence things like polinia<br>um that can be taken up by the research<br>Community relatively quickly so so we're<br>we're doing a lot of this small scale<br>process work but it'll<br>um to improve Those computer models over<br>the longer timeline but I can see that<br>it's actually just the improved direct<br>monitoring to show salinity and<br>temperature Trends that's probably going<br>um and an example of that<br>is out of the Anu group and this is an<br>ocean model and here we've peeled away<br>most of the ocean and we're looking at<br>the water that's been affected by the<br>the salty water that's coming out of<br>polinia that have been affected by the<br>water that's been coming out of ice<br>shelves and so it's this water that's<br>draining out on the sea floor of the<br>ocean and works its way through the<br>entire<br>um global thermohaline system there's<br>the potential to change this if we<br>change how polinia operate<br>we change how the planet works<br>this these sorts of changes won't happen<br>quickly we're looking we're looking at a<br>process that's 500 to A Thousand Years<br>in sort of time scale but then lots of<br>the the some of the lots of the sea<br>level rise uh worst case scenarios are<br>over those sort of century kind of time<br>scales as well<br>but it's it's also<br>a nice point to reflect on the<br>connectedness of the oceans<br>um<br>so the spill house projection puts<br>Antarctica in the middle and shows how<br>the ocean basins are all joined<br>and so process is happening on the<br>Antarctic margins will persist so the<br>water that we're seeing coming out of<br>the Ross ice shelf at the moment we're<br>expecting to see that come past the<br>Chatham Islands in about 200 years 300<br>years we're sort of working on those<br>sorts of processes before it then it<br>gets into the North Pacific and then<br>comes back up to the surface again<br>um but if you were looking at the<br>guardian this morning<br>um and including Kevin trimberth from<br>the physics department a group of<br>authors have come out with the latest<br>review on the continuing Trend in ocean<br>temperature change<br>um 93 of the heat that the planet is<br>capturing is going into the ocean and so<br>yes there will be changes and issues in<br>Antarctica and yes that will influence<br>sea level rise but I'm guessing that<br>we'll be seeing Direct effects around<br>New Zealand through impact on ecosystem<br>and impacts on weather and so I think<br>the the temperature structure the um<br>so the surface waters globally are going<br>to be a significant issue in the coming<br>decades<br>and so it's worth reflecting from an<br>oceanographic perspective where I guess<br>around half my time is spent on Ocean<br>problems around New Zealand in terms of<br>funding structures there's nothing like<br>the level of consistent resourcing that<br>we're seeing made available for<br>Antarctic work we just can't pull that<br>sort of resourcing together for New<br>Zealand for our own ease at our own<br>backyard to be monitoring some of these<br>dramatic changes we know<br>what the surface is doing satellites are<br>very powerful at telling us what surface<br>changes are happening in terms of<br>temperature in terms of chlorophyll and<br>color and things like that but they<br>don't penetrate beneath the surface and<br>so they don't give you that vertical<br>dimension on the heat content<br>around New Zealand around the planet and<br>so for that you have to rely on things<br>like Argo floats and they they're a<br>dramatic Improvement in the past decades<br>in terms of data that comes in but they<br>don't work on our Continental shelves<br>and so where we're really at risk<br>of not knowing enough about our own<br>backyard and so recent reports from the<br>Parliamentary commissioner for the<br>environment and MFE support that in that<br>they they walk a line and reflect on the<br>the paucity and the sort of ad hoc<br>nature of some of our monitoring of our<br>environmental systems and especially in<br>the ocean or my reading of it is<br>especially in the ocean<br>um so I took took us through some<br>Discovery some six cool things<br>um but you know the take-home message is<br>more complicated than we think we saw<br>things like um the the fresh water<br>jetting out from underneath the ice<br>sheet<br>um we saw the rough underside of the ice<br>rough at a number of different scales we<br>saw the middle of the water column<br>um is not always sort of well behaved<br>um<br>that's going to take us through to<br>improved models and we're continuing to<br>improve our monitoring in Antarctic<br>Coastal margins but reflecting on the<br>ocean holding almost all the heat in our<br>changing planet and one would argue that<br>really we want to avoid the worst of the<br>the coming challenges I guess you know<br>the the Soundbar is we could turn off<br>all our emissions if we could turn off<br>all our emissions tomorrow<br>and clean our atmosphere our air<br>temperatures would continue to rise for<br>a couple of decades due to the heat<br>and just<br>to as a soft ending just take you on a<br>walk through one of our<br>um<br>ice shelf camps and so this was put<br>together by Andy Mullen<br>from Cornell and he just walks us<br>through we just walk through the living<br>quarters so you get to camp on 80 meters<br>of snow<br>all the action happens in the big big<br>orange tent<br>which gives you sort of snow blindness<br>after a couple of weeks<br>you can see lots of the lines laid out<br>that are being passed down the hole to<br>pump in uh warm water<br>um Andy here is focusing on some of<br>air temperatures minus five to minus 15.<br>um<br>it's quite benign really this is January<br>quite a lot of space for scientists to<br>do their work we would operate with a<br>mix of<br>and field support from Antarctica New<br>Zealand keeping us safe and operating so<br>stuff like generators<br>um<br>health and safety operations and then<br>the food all happens in here<br>so we normally operate with around 20 to<br>25 people<br>a third of those spent three weeks<br>driving there and we'll spend three<br>weeks driving back and then the rest of<br>us a little bit like Sydney Nolan at the<br>start gets to sort of fly in and just<br>quickly collect some data and go home<br>and reflect on it for the following<br>couple of years<br>so I'll leave it there and thank you<br>very much for coming out tonight and<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
