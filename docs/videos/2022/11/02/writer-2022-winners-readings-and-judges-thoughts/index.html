FM<br>Dunedin with support from New Zealand on<br>kurokoto katore and welcome to a show<br>celebrating writer the University's<br>annual creative writing competition I'm<br>Nicola Cummins and I'm Lisa dick we're<br>both staff members at the University I'm<br>the University's publication editor and<br>Nicola is a teaching fellow in the<br>English and Linguistics program<br>Nicola and I have been running this<br>competition together for the past few<br>years after launching it as part of the<br>University's 150th celebrations back in<br>that glorious pre-pandemic year 2019.<br>the competition aims to celebrate the<br>creativity of otago staff and students<br>and this year for the first time we also<br>opened it up to alumni<br>otago research shows that being creative<br>is really good for mental health and so<br>we felt it was important to Foster and<br>support that the competition's been<br>popular each year attracting many<br>entries we were particularly pleased<br>with how many entries we received from<br>alumni this year and that included many<br>living around the globe that's right not<br>only did our entries come from staff and<br>students at all of our otago campuses<br>around New Zealand they also came from<br>alumni spread around the world and we<br>had close to 100 entries<br>many of our entrants told us they were<br>grateful for a competition that<br>motivated them to sit down and write as<br>usual we asked our entrants to enter<br>either a poem or a short story and also<br>as usual we devised a writing prompt as<br>we collectively move forward from the<br>pandemic years this year our prompt was<br>Brave New World in a moment you'll hear<br>our winners reading their entries but<br>first we'll introduce you to our judge<br>we're lucky enough to have a successful<br>New Zealand writer on staff at otago<br>well actually we have several of them<br>but this year Craig Cliff agreed to be<br>our judge and it's been our pleasure and<br>privilege to work with them Craig is net<br>carbon zero program manager at the<br>University's sustainability office and<br>the author of two novels and a short<br>story collection<br>in addition to fiction Craig has<br>published poetry essays and reviews and<br>he's been a newspaper columnist he joins<br>us in the studio now Kilda Craig Kia Ora<br>thanks for having me<br>as I mentioned earlier we had nearly 100<br>entries this year what was your overall<br>impression of the works when you sat<br>down to judge them<br>it's always a real privilege to see that<br>many Works across a range of people in<br>different stages of their lives and<br>stages of their careers and stages of<br>their studies and it was really<br>interesting to me to be taken to<br>different different worlds distant<br>planets under the under the sea thinking<br>about the the lives of native birds and<br>from their perspective so lots of lots<br>of zaniness lots of creativity so that's<br>a real privilege um it was also<br>interesting to see how people had taken<br>the theme of Brave New World and applied<br>that to the covid-19 pandemic and sort<br>of that The New Normal concept and<br>thinking about how we were entering into<br>this Brave New World I think<br>particularly for staff it seemed to be a<br>resonant theme a lot of our staff have<br>come from overseas to to live in New<br>Zealand and thinking about that break<br>with their homelanders seemed to be<br>quite a a strong inspiration for for<br>their poetry and for their short story<br>so yeah as I say really fascinating to<br>see what's interesting to people what's<br>motivating to them to actually get down<br>and write<br>um in 2022<br>Craig before we hear each of the winners<br>reading their work we'd love it if you<br>could give us your opinion of the<br>apartment story and tell us what made<br>them stand out as winners<br>we're going to start with our poetry<br>winners and our student when it was<br>Linux Tate who's is finishing up degrees<br>in law in Commerce his very witty poem<br>flipped the theme as you'll hear Craig<br>what did you love about this poem<br>as I said the theme is a jumping off<br>point and it should You're Expecting the<br>poem or the short story to relate to it<br>in some way and I responded with Glee<br>whenever someone took it in a New<br>Direction and this one was one where as<br>I say um it's a bit dead joke adjacent<br>the way that they take the theme of<br>Brave New World<br>um and they really go for it you know<br>hammer and tongs trying different forms<br>it moves around on the page and I<br>thought you know here's someone who's<br>brought a lot of energy to this here's<br>somebody who's<br>um yeah as I say really gone for it and<br>that stuck with me that level of energy<br>and enthusiasm<br>thanks Craig it's now our great pleasure<br>to introduce Lennox Tate Kilda Linux<br>thanks for joining us<br>good morning thank you for having me now<br>tell us about your work<br>um yeah sure so initially I saw this<br>competition um you know I was just<br>scrolling through my emails I was<br>procrastinating for an assignment<br>um and this thing really caught my eye<br>and then this theme Brave New World<br>um I read the book uh years ago back in<br>high school and while I don't remember a<br>lot of the details I remember that I<br>appreciated the work but I didn't enjoy<br>it very much I thought it was you know a<br>bit dark a bit grim and so I saw the<br>theme and immediately just wanted to<br>flip it a little bit on his head<br>um and then I think the supermarket new<br>world was just the most logical choice<br>um I really like the idea of turning<br>mundane life experiences into these big<br>Grand Adventures you know something<br>really interesting and I really like to<br>extract the humor from situations that<br>don't seem that<br>um humorful at first glance and so<br>that's kind of what I hope to do with<br>this piece<br>thank you Linux and we all do love a pun<br>so now we'd love to hear your poem<br>absolutely<br>though at a glance this piece appears<br>extremely plain and played a rather<br>mundane tradition a far cry from<br>Orwell's 84.<br>please observe with eyes and ears your<br>caution should be paid<br>behold my dystopian expedition to the<br>grocery store<br>Act One

dragged into Focus I write a poem<br>far too long<br>although eldest tale may not be the<br>future which we seek<br>raving new world is something I do<br>almost every week<br>thanks so much Linux we're going to<br>continue with poetry and hear from our<br>staff and alumni winners yes up next is<br>our staff winner Abby Smith Abby is a<br>professor of Marine Science who studies<br>shell geochemistry and ocean<br>acidification she's also a very keen<br>writer and has been for years and was<br>inspired for this competition by verse 2<br>of All My Hope on God is founded by<br>Joachim neander as translated by Robert<br>Bridges<br>though with care and toil we build them<br>Tower and Temple fall to dust<br>Craig what made the century stand out to<br>you<br>this one was<br>um different to some of the others where<br>there was lots of<br>um uh energy but maybe the form was a<br>little bit Helter Skelter this one there<br>was so much care and so much attention<br>just as the first line sort of talks<br>about so it was really form was matching<br>content I thought that was it was really<br>thoughtful and really well done and I I<br>thought you know this being the staff<br>category I thought oh this must be<br>someone from religious studies they're<br>using you know these religious motifs so<br>it's really interesting to find out as<br>with all of these who the winners were<br>and to find that um Abby is in Marine<br>Science and it's just amazing what sort<br>of creative people we have throughout<br>the University<br>thanks Craig and now we're thrilled to<br>tell us about your poem and how you came<br>to write it well I've been writing<br>poetry since I was a teenager and I'm 61<br>now so that was been a long time<br>um and I uh I I always sort of look at<br>things and and become inspired by them<br>and the thing that this particular poem<br>comes from is first of all the anyway<br>poem which is purported to be written by<br>Mother Teresa but really was written by<br>Kent Keith and the line that is<br>particularly relevant here is what you<br>spend years creating others could<br>destroy overnight create anyway<br>I find that really powerful<br>um the idea that it really doesn't<br>matter and then I was um singing at<br>church and uh the hymn All My Hope on<br>God is founded which was written in 1680<br>so it's um pretty Universal I guess<br>translated much later and the line that<br>struck me was though with care and toil<br>we build them Tower and Temple fall to<br>dust so I was thinking about things<br>passing and moving on and and breaking<br>and of course I'm getting older so I<br>think about that more often and that's<br>where this poem came from<br>and be given your profession as a as a<br>scientist uh do you find much time for<br>writing or was this a bit of a one-off<br>well no I'm lucky to be part of a<br>writing group it's called Poems Prayers<br>Psalms and prose and is based up in<br>opahoe and I wrote this for them and<br>they really liked it which is why I was<br>brave enough to submit it for the<br>competition<br>thank you Abby and now we're going to<br>hear you recite your poem thank you very<br>much<br>it's called Falling Falling<br>somewhere a child cries because her<br>block tower has fallen down<br>so much care so much time so much<br>attention we spend on our things<br>building towers of blocks<br>making calls making meetings making<br>progress we focus on our things our<br>handmade towers of blocks<br>growing taller spreading wider becoming<br>older we carefully nurture our things<br>our growing towers of blocks<br>Gathering planting making singing<br>painting we create and collect our<br>things our pretty Tower of blocks<br>alas humans every Tower Falls every<br>dream dies every Temple goes to dust<br>even you even you<br>but shall we not care not build not<br>nurture not create is transients the<br>Fatal flaw<br>we all come we all go after all after<br>all<br>could we learn slowly that things have<br>value though they will not last<br>like a sand castle<br>like a sidewalk painting like a handful<br>of daisies<br>like an apple pie<br>like me<br>let us care about things though they<br>pass let us joyfully build though it<br>will fall let us carefully nurture<br>though it will die let us create and<br>somewhere a child picks up her blocks<br>and begins again<br>thanks Abby and now for our last poem<br>the winner of our alumni poetry category<br>was Giles Graham his poem is called it<br>was not the new world I feared Craig<br>what did you love about this poem what I<br>loved about this poem this was one of<br>the ones that probably stuck with me the<br>most the one that I thought about the<br>next day and the day after that and<br>the reason is the theme or the the the<br>subject that it deals with is the<br>anxiety preceding the birth of your<br>second child after having a somewhat<br>traumatic experience with the birth of<br>the first child<br>and without giving too much away it<br>doesn't just cover that it ends in a<br>different place and it's sort of a more<br>of an uplifting ending and I thought it<br>had two things going for it one was the<br>I hadn't seen this topic explored much<br>in in um in poetry or in fiction<br>um so it was something fresh and<br>something that really got me thinking<br>having had um gone through to<br>um to having two children I was gonna<br>say I haven't gone through two births<br>but I don't want to take claim for that<br>um but and the second thing was the<br>uplifting ending because I think<br>um and a lot of<br>um these writing competitions people<br>pick really traumatic events and that's<br>that's great that's something that you<br>can compress a lot of meaning into a<br>short amount of space but to twist it<br>and have something uplifting that was<br>really a welcome thing for me as the<br>judge now we're going to hear from Giles<br>Graham uh Giles graduated in 2016 with a<br>degree in physics and Mathematics and<br>he's now working as an epidemiology<br>analyst for ESR<br>my poem asked it's called it was not the<br>new world I feared and it was written<br>shortly after the birth of my second<br>child<br>um I often find oh I've have found in<br>the after the each child there's been a<br>flurry of poetic activity perhaps<br>because I've had time off and have been<br>working perhaps the media of sleep<br>deprivation<br>so whatever the reason uh again I had<br>that and this is what came out of it<br>this time it was a reflection on the<br>fact that we had a lot of fears going<br>into<br>Parenthood again but we were still<br>looking forward to it but<br>having your first child is is<br>frightening and scary and there's so<br>much new and<br>it feels really overwhelming at times<br>and I was I expected particularly that<br>it would be the same again there would<br>be the same sort of overwhelming anxiety<br>and tension around this newborn but<br>um and so I was just so relieved when um<br>seeing our second child arrives and it<br>was really smooth really smooth delivery<br>and suddenly like I could feel the<br>accumulated wealth of knowledge that<br>we'd picked up over the last two years<br>kind of guiding me and reassuring me and<br>what to do<br>um and so this poem was kind of written<br>out of that out of reflecting on the<br>so yeah that's a lovely piece of context<br>for your work so can we hear it now<br>please<br>you absolutely can yes<br>so yes my name again it's Charles Graham<br>and the poem is called it was not the<br>new world I feared<br>I thank the Lord it was not as we<br>expected from our first child the<br>drowning sensation<br>taught days pressed As Leaves From A<br>fraught Wilderness the anxiety under<br>current<br>when an open-mouthed anguish our second<br>son Drew a small and shuddered breath<br>the old grip of Fear sound instead a cry<br>soft as a plum Falling In Summer smaller<br>than a Periwinkle<br>gentle as a pasta shell for the weight<br>of the bed covers on the first night for<br>the coolness of dark for the same world<br>I loved just richer<br>thank you so much Giles and I'm sure<br>many parents will be identifying with<br>the situation that you've outlined in<br>your poem so thank you once again thanks<br>Giles we're now going to move on to our<br>three winning short stories our stories<br>were limited to 2500 words and we were<br>really impressed by the many and varied<br>ways our writers interpreted our prompt<br>and the excellent stories they produced<br>it wasn't an easy job for Craig to<br>choose our winners no but we made him do<br>it anyway and we love the choices he<br>made Craig what was it like picking the<br>winners from the stories<br>yeah it was interesting thinking about<br>the poetry and and the short stories the<br>big difference obviously is the length<br>and the the time it takes to read a<br>short story versus a poem and so I<br>reread the Poetry quite a lot<br>um and you find yourself it isn't just<br>natural being a bit impatient with the<br>short stories so that any advice to<br>anyone thinking about writing and um<br>entering short story competitions is<br>you've got to grab the judge you need to<br>be nice and clear in the beginning I<br>like to be transported somewhere new but<br>I need to be also comfortable when I'm<br>being transported somewhere new and so<br>the successful stories were doing that<br>it was nice I felt like it entered into<br>a new world like entering into a warm<br>bath<br>Craig we'll start with our student<br>winner Jessica bent Jessica's in her<br>final final few days of her theology PhD<br>and her story aimed to explore the idea<br>of Earth in the near future it's<br>entitled my friend The Stranger Craig<br>what Drew you to this story<br>so there was a lot of sci-fi people<br>taking Brave New World and taking it in<br>science fiction directions and that was<br>really great I think this was probably<br>the most successful entry that that did<br>that because as I was saying it it felt<br>like I knew this world and I knew these<br>characters and so lots of thought and<br>Care had been put into the details that<br>were being presented and there was just<br>that right mix between I don't know what<br>this world is and and you know all of<br>the elements but I feel like I'm I'm<br>finding out as we're going so I never<br>felt uncomfortable and yeah and it<br>really went off in a great Direction<br>thanks Craig it's now our pleasure to<br>introduce you to Jessica Cora Jessica<br>and welcome<br>hello<br>um Jessica tell us about your story for<br>the competition<br>yeah so when I saw the<br>brief prompt I went straight to Lake<br>Huxley and I read that in high school<br>and he's an amazing writer but I wasn't<br>the content didn't resonate with me so I<br>was like all right what can I do to<br>explore that sort of<br>that idea of a Brave New World and I<br>love sci-fi and so I wanted to kind of<br>write something along those lines and I<br>got to explore both the new worlds<br>um through our perspective and then our<br>Earth as a new world through our<br>character's perspective which was a<br>really fun interweaving I think<br>awesome and now we're going to hear<br>Jessica's story<br>all right my friend<br>The Stranger<br>I'm often asked what the most<br>significant moment in my life was I<br>usually spend some line about being<br>accepted into the academy that's not<br>strictly true it was an important moment<br>in my life I don't know if I've ever<br>felt prouder of myself as I did that day<br>when the notice arrived congratulating<br>me on winning one of 10 spots in the<br>star Searcher program<br>despite that celebrated event the real<br>moment my destiny changed forever was<br>much earlier when I was only five or six<br>rotations old one of my favorite<br>pastimes was to crawl through the small<br>Dusty tunnels on my father's property<br>I'm still not sure what they were<br>originally for but to a little girl with<br>stories in her head and curiosity in her<br>blood they were the height of excitement<br>I'd found a new tunnel near father's<br>laboratory and every warning he'd ever<br>given me about not playing near the<br>building flew from my head I reached<br>down my small fingers curling around the<br>bars covering the entrance to my new<br>Hiding Place with the great out of the<br>way I wiggled down into the opening dust<br>and Vin Val Webbs clinging to my robes I<br>had fun exploring the tunnels twists and<br>turns that was until I heard a strange<br>sound I paused<br>my fingers curling into fists causing my<br>nails to bite into the sensitive skin of<br>my Palms<br>I'd never heard anything like it it<br>sounded much like a cross between a Juco<br>pup and a moon girl chick it crooned and<br>changed tones and Pitch sliding up and<br>down in an eerie but Tyson away<br>the sound continued to echo through the<br>tunnel a chewed the inside of my cheek<br>part of me wanted to crawl out of that<br>tunnel as fast as my small hands and<br>knees could take me the other part the<br>much larger part burned with curiosity I<br>had to know what was making that sound<br>the possibility that it could be one of<br>Father's experiments never even crossed<br>my mind<br>crawling forward I followed the sounds<br>echoing up through the narrow space it<br>only took me a few more minutes before I<br>reached another great<br>this one wasn't so easily removed I<br>tugged at it straining with all my might<br>but it refused to budge none of the<br>other greats had been difficult to shift<br>even for a child as young as I was<br>I must have made a lot of noise as I<br>tried to move the metal bars because the<br>strange sound stopped my eyes widened as<br>I realized I Disturbed the creature<br>I was just about to turn around to make<br>a break for the surface when a<br>terrifying shape appeared on the other<br>side of the grate I'm not ashamed to say<br>I screamed<br>the creature in the other room stumbled<br>back and pressed what I assumed were its<br>hands to its head<br>when I stopped screaming it lowered<br>those odd five fingered hands to its<br>side and smiled at me with yellowed<br>teeth<br>is spoke strangely with sounds that made<br>no sense to my ears I frowned and then<br>looked fervently behind me into the dark<br>mouth of the tunnel I was sitting at the<br>edge of<br>maybe I could still Escape<br>when I didn't respond to the creature's<br>strange words it moved closer to me it's<br>odd dark eyes crinkling at the corners<br>you<br>um little trunga it said stiltedly<br>startling me when it spoke in my tongue<br>I the creature said placing its pale<br>hands against its funny flat chest and<br>been<br>it then reached out its hand to me I<br>squealed and scrambled back the creature<br>lifted its hands up in the sign of peace<br>and made shushing sounds<br>I crawled back to the great my heart<br>pounding but my mind curious as to what<br>this strange creature was it looked<br>nothing like me with heavy lines on its<br>face a pointed nose and fluffy white<br>stuff that danced about the top and<br>bottom of its head my gray eyes looked<br>at it between thick heavy strands of<br>hair<br>every chunga had 12 that by the deities<br>Cree were never to be cut<br>were there no strands on the stranger's<br>head its fluff seems like it had no<br>beginning and no end the creature Rose<br>his hands once more to his chest and<br>repeated the word bin I'd never heard<br>such a word before but when he howled<br>out his hand and asked you<br>I knew he was asking my name<br>I said quietly the smile he gave me was<br>dazzling hello he said as his hands<br>fluttered in front of him in an official<br>greeting<br>against my best to judgment<br>though what child of my age even has any<br>I smiled my lips parting to reveal my<br>small teeth they'd just been sharpened<br>on my fifth rotation signaling that I<br>was no longer a baby<br>I was very proud of my teeth<br>hello bien I said trying to get my<br>tongue around the stranger's unusual<br>name I didn't know it then but that<br>night would change my life forever<br>I would crawl down that tunnel at every<br>chance I got to see my strange friend we<br>would exchange stories and try to speak<br>in each other's tongues<br>it usually went badly and we'd be left<br>laughing as we made silly sounds and<br>said rude things by accident<br>one day<br>it was close to my eighth rotation I<br>think Ben told me about his planet and<br>his family<br>I cried for a week when he said it had<br>been more than 12 rotations since he'd<br>crashed on our planet and that he knew<br>he'd never see his son again he hoped<br>that Charlie his son<br>had grown up into a fine young man and<br>that his wife then never told me her<br>name had found someone else who could<br>love her as much as he did<br>it didn't seem fair there's kind<br>stranger from the Stars not being able<br>to get home<br>when I asked him if he would go home if<br>he could Ben looked at me sadly and<br>explained that his planet was sick and<br>he was part of a team trying to find a<br>new place to live<br>the people who had lived on his Planet<br>weren't like the people of tuna they<br>couldn't hear the songs of the trees or<br>the speech of the ocean or understand<br>the chittering of the animals they<br>weren't connected to their Planet their<br>bodies didn't bleed when the planet bled<br>they weren't born from the flowers of<br>the tufaula plant<br>I asked him why they didn't try to make<br>the planet Earth he called it better he<br>told me they did try but some powerful<br>people cared more for money than the<br>ground they walked on and then he told<br>me about the wars and the fighting<br>I was so horrified that I ran away<br>before he could finish the story and<br>didn't go back in that tunnel almost 12<br>moons<br>shortly after my 13th rotation I<br>realized that it was almost impossible<br>to fit in the tunnels anymore going<br>forward was okay if I stayed on my<br>stomach but getting back wasn't possible<br>anymore I cried the night I realized<br>thinking I would never see my strange<br>old friend again<br>I yelled and screamed and begged the<br>deity to make me small again to stop<br>changing my body into a woman's and let<br>it stay like a child's<br>but the deity didn't listen<br>I kept growing<br>it was almost an entire rotation before<br>I worked out how to break into father's<br>lab<br>it hadn't been hard to figure out where<br>Ben was kept what was hard was trying to<br>figure out how to get in<br>though our people are peaceful we are<br>not perfect as my father often reminded<br>me<br>if we were we wouldn't need the deity he<br>would say instead he argued that we<br>would be the deity I thought that was<br>silly but he believed it so I didn't<br>argue<br>unfortunately father's belief meant he<br>kept the laboratory secured with more<br>mocks and funny devices than any other<br>place I knew<br>but I was curious<br>and stubborn<br>and I missed my friend<br>one night I managed to get in I was<br>terrified I snuck through father's lab<br>like there was a grumble in the building<br>which would find me and eat me if I made<br>any noise what did I know maybe father<br>really did have a Grimble locked up in<br>there too<br>despite my slow Advance through the<br>building finding Ben didn't take me long<br>I forgot the need to be quiet and rushed<br>toward the glass wall that had been<br>hidden from my view when I'd been<br>crammed into the tunnel Ben Ben I cried<br>waving and smiling through my happy<br>tears he looked up at me from where he'd<br>been sitting on a small couch his<br>eyebrows raised in Surprise and a watery<br>smile pulled at his lips I was shocked<br>at how much he'd changed well I'd grown<br>larger gaining height and weight Ben<br>looked like he Shrunk the funny lines<br>that had always marked his face looked<br>deeper and his skin had a weird yellow<br>tinge his cheekbones were sharp and the<br>hands he shakily reached out to me were<br>Skin and Bones my tears of joy turned to<br>tears of Sorrow what was happening to my<br>friend<br>we talked for a while through that glass<br>wall before he grew too tired to speak<br>I told him about my last year and<br>everything I'd been learning at school<br>even though I knew he'd fallen asleep<br>pressed against the transparent barrier<br>it isn't fair I thought as I hugged my<br>knees and picked it a few flaking scales<br>on the back of my hand<br>I'd worked so hard to see Ben again and<br>he was sick<br>I was still sitting there watching him<br>when my father walked in he said in<br>shock I sprung to my feet and winced I<br>was gonna be in a lot of trouble for<br>breaking into his lab<br>good evening father I said straightening<br>trying to appear that it wasn't unusual<br>for us to meet like this he looked he<br>looked at me fondly for all the things<br>you could say about my father you<br>couldn't say he didn't love me<br>I see you've met Ben<br>he eventually said breaking the tent<br>silence I nodded and turned round<br>placing my palm flat on the glass<br>what's happened to him I whispered<br>My Father's Eyes flashed with<br>understanding he knew this wasn't the<br>first time I'd encountered The Stranger<br>he's sick<br>dying I've tried everything<br>but I don't know how to save him<br>father then explained that when Ben was<br>first discovered he'd petitioned to the<br>council to let him study the strange<br>creature instead of killing and<br>dissecting him in fear of who and what<br>he was<br>upon receiving permission father built<br>the laboratory and tried to make bins<br>stay comfortable even as he observed The<br>Stranger<br>it wasn't long before the receivers<br>chose me to be gifted the next child<br>born of the two full of flowers that we<br>finally started to understand each other<br>then became my friend Father Finnish<br>sadly his hand reaching out to settle on<br>the cool glass next to mine<br>father let me visit Ben every night<br>after I'd finished my homework<br>that time has been seared into my memory<br>and is why I do what I do Ben spoke more<br>about Earth during that time than he'd<br>ever done before he mourned the fact<br>that he'd never be buried with his<br>family I'd had to ask him what he meant<br>and was surprised to learn that on his<br>Planet they often placed the bodies of<br>the Dead beneath the grass and soil here<br>the spirits of those who passed live<br>with the Stars and light the deities<br>path their bodies which they don't need<br>anymore<br>a return to the tufula plant so that<br>another child can be born<br>it was three moons before my 15th<br>rotation when my father met me at the<br>door of our house after school<br>I didn't need the green robes to tell me<br>someone had died the tears in his eyes<br>would have said it just as plainly I<br>dropped my school pack to the ground in<br>sorrow<br>the echo of its thumb as it hit the<br>floor still reverbiates through my mind<br>almost 20 rotations later<br>without a word I spun round and ran to<br>the laboratory my feet flying across the<br>ground Ben was still there lying in his<br>bed I could almost imagine that he had<br>just fallen asleep while we'd been<br>talking<br>but I knew that wasn't the truth his<br>eyes did blankly up at the ceiling and<br>his chest was still<br>there was no more rattle as he breathed<br>no more coughs that shook his body<br>I fell to my knees and cried curling<br>into my father's Embrace when he joined<br>me and lowered himself to the floor to<br>my 35th rotation was last week and today<br>me and my team of five are leaving tuna<br>we are star Searchers and have been<br>traveling among the lights of her<br>ancestors for many years always<br>remembering to return home to our<br>fathers mothers sons and daughters<br>today though<br>is special<br>we found Earth<br>I'm going to take my friend home<br>I'm going to fulfill The Vow I made on<br>the cold floor of the laboratory that<br>day<br>and just as I will be given to the<br>tefula plant Ben will be buried with his<br>people<br>we smile and wave for the news feeds<br>before ascending the ramp onto our<br>starflyer the journey is long<br>and we almost turn back<br>perhaps one day I'll tell the story of<br>our adventures and mishaps as we are<br>Guided by the likes of our ancestors<br>just as the deity is<br>but we prevail<br>I stand here this morning on the ground<br>of a new planet squinting in the foreign<br>yellow light surrounded by a hundred<br>curious faces who look so much like Ben<br>that I want to cry<br>I take a deep breath<br>summon my bravery and willing my tongue<br>to speak in words long forgotten<br>hello<br>I'm total and I have come to bury my<br>friend<br>this world is old and scarred by Wars<br>and neglect but to me the white fluffy<br>clouds and the Kaleidoscope of colors<br>made by the skin and hair of the people<br>around me signal something new something<br>exciting something to love and explore<br>it is brand new world and maybe<br>we can help her live<br>thanks so much Jessica and now we move<br>on to our next fiction winner staff<br>member Jenny Jory once you hear her<br>story it'll be no surprise to you that<br>she works at the hocken collections her<br>story is called a discovery donor<br>unknown Craig what did you love about<br>this story<br>this one was a bit different to some of<br>the others where it started in the in<br>the Brave New World this one started in<br>a really familiar place and as you say I<br>was playing this kissing game is this<br>the Hawken does this person work in the<br>hokken so that was a little uh free song<br>for me I was excited by that but then it<br>starts in this recognizable Ordinary<br>World but then it gets stranger and<br>weirder and it was really exciting to be<br>stretched and and to wonder as we're<br>going how far is this going to take us<br>yeah<br>thanks Craig and now we'd like to<br>welcome Jenny to the show hi Jenny Cura<br>Janine tell us about your story and how<br>you came to write it uh yes so this was<br>really inspired a lot by what I do as a<br>job so I work I'm a collections<br>assistant at the Hawken Library<br>um so we've got lots of Fantastical<br>collections lots of archives lots of old<br>photos lots of really cool cereals and<br>Publications<br>um so I feel like I'm just always seeing<br>all these cool historical things coming<br>through and I did a history degree so<br>I'm really interested in that sort of<br>stuff<br>um and then I guess the sort of weird<br>part of it is very inspired by my<br>ongoing Dungeons and Dragons game that I<br>play with my friends<br>um my character in that game is a siren<br>so it was just sort of like pulling from<br>all the things that I do so I've sort of<br>written this story about a librarian who<br>sort of uncovers this new world with all<br>these like mythological creatures being<br>real<br>um so yeah just sort of<br>I've been doing writing sessions with a<br>friend to sort of like<br>just get into it more regularly<br>um but this was not really something<br>that happened in one of the sessions it<br>was like a struggling to sleep night and<br>then it was just like 1am and it was<br>just like these words started going<br>through my head as I have to get up I<br>have to write this down or I'm not going<br>to remember it so I ended up going to<br>sleep till about two or three in the<br>morning because it's just typing<br>furiously on my phone being like I need<br>to write this down<br>um but yeah that's sort of how it came<br>about<br>that's a great origin story thank you<br>Jenny and now we'd love to hear it<br>okay you find a lot of interesting<br>things working at a Historical Library<br>you never know why what might be donated<br>or what you might retrieve for a patron<br>for example just last week we received<br>donations of early newspapers artworks<br>of cats early photos of the area and I<br>retrieved an archive that contained<br>pictures of my grandmother it's all very<br>interesting and the people who bring<br>them in always have long stories to tell<br>about how these items came into their<br>position<br>but it's all run-of-the-mill standard<br>historical fear never anything<br>unexplained or unusual<br>that was until the donation I received<br>we have less staff on the premises on<br>the weekend so it was just the four of<br>us and I was in the office covering a<br>lunch break when he came in he looked<br>frazzled his glasses are skew on his<br>face as he pushed through the doors with<br>a giant box full to bursting with the<br>lid teetering dangerously on top<br>I started going through the usual<br>process filling out the receipt form<br>with him but he was being oddly cagey<br>with his details<br>the material he said belonged to his<br>late mother who had recently passed so I<br>could use her estate's information on<br>the receipt<br>under no circumstances he emphasized did<br>he want any of the material returned if<br>we didn't want it for our collection he<br>would rather see it burned he said than<br>back in his spare room<br>when I asked what sort of items were in<br>the box he waved his hand oh some marine<br>biology stuff she was an Enthusiast he<br>said studying the local marine life off<br>the coast by her house<br>she collected all sorts but he had<br>thrown away a lot of the junk shells and<br>bits that weren't archive quality he<br>said making quotation marks with his<br>hands<br>when I pressed further saying I might<br>need to pass items onto different<br>curators he said there were some<br>Publications a lot of personal papers<br>some recordings she had made as well as<br>a few photo albums<br>no sooner had I obtained his own<br>unintelligible signature and given him<br>the copy of the receipt had he rushed<br>off scrunching up the form within<br>viewing distance of my desk and hurling<br>it into the bin outside<br>just like that he was gone and I would<br>never see him again<br>I took the box back to my desk after<br>lunch resolved her sort through it so<br>that I could send items off to the<br>relevant curators before Monday<br>many items were as described photos of a<br>coastline I could vaguely pick the<br>location of a book on mollusks sketches<br>of rock pools a scientific Community<br>newsletter and what looked like papers<br>detailing some sort of research project<br>there was also a Dusty pile of labeled<br>cassettes and a portable deck player the<br>kind I had as a kid in the 90s with<br>tinny headphones that look like you<br>could snap them in half<br>there was already a cassette in the<br>player<br>curiosity got the better of me<br>it would be helpful anyway to know what<br>was on them the labels were old peeling<br>and smudged on this one I could only<br>make out a short word that started with<br>I put new batteries in and shut myself<br>in the breakout room I hit play<br>it was crackly and fuzzy at first like<br>it hadn't been played in a while<br>then I could make out the sound of the<br>seaside<br>seagulls coring overhead and the gentle<br>rocking of waves as if they were hitting<br>up against something<br>it was pleasant but nothing<br>groundbreaking<br>just the sounds of a life lived like so<br>many other items in our collections<br>there was aesthetic kiss<br>and for a second I was sure I had<br>wrecked the tape and the ribbon was<br>about to come spewing out all distorted<br>and unplayable and I was about to be in<br>big trouble<br>the static stopped and a song began<br>it was the most beautiful sound I have<br>ever heard and in that moment I was<br>obsessed my heart was caught in my<br>throat as this strange voice somehow<br>reached into the depths of my very Soul<br>pulling out emotions I had long since<br>buried<br>there were no lyrics only notes somehow<br>layered over each other despite it being<br>clear there was only one voice<br>it couldn't be human no music had ever<br>expressed such a yearning that hit so<br>quickly to my core<br>I felt a huge pressure around me as if I<br>were diving deeper and deeper into<br>something unknown<br>unknowable<br>and then the pressure was gone<br>I wish I could say I felt guilty about<br>what I did next but that would be a lie<br>I stole the cassette<br>and the player and the papers and a book<br>on Greek mythology I found squashed in<br>the bottom I flipped through the<br>sketches grabbing some anatomical<br>drawings and rifled through the photo<br>albums<br>there was one photo that stood out so I<br>ripped it from its plastic enclosure and<br>stuffed it in my bag<br>and then I walked out trying my hardest<br>not to run<br>even with the player in my bag the song<br>was still echoing in my head<br>that was four days ago I have called in<br>set to work each of those days<br>I have not been sick<br>I have been frantic<br>I have been examining papers looking up<br>biological terminology I had no reason<br>to understand before<br>researching Oceanic exploration deep sea<br>creatures and even conspiracies like the<br>Aquatic ape matching the photo to image<br>searches of the local Coastline I have<br>been reading Greek mythology and<br>tracking similar myths throughout time<br>I have spent four days with one song<br>stuck in my head calling to me<br>the song lasts for the entirety of side<br>B on the cassette<br>on side a there are seven words spoken<br>it is the singer I am sure of it<br>so Calliope must be the marine biologist<br>her papers are all so well written so<br>backed with scientific fact at least<br>from what I can make sense of it but I<br>can see why they were never submitted<br>Calliope was researching Sirens the<br>mythological woman who lured Sailors to<br>their watery Graves creatures who have<br>somehow survived from ancient stories to<br>Modern media is their fictional<br>pervasiveness based in fact Calliope<br>seemed to think so<br>in the photo it was an old Square<br>Polaroid the color faded with age<br>it showed the head and shoulders of a<br>woman in the ocean behind a rocky<br>outcrop it was hard to tell with the<br>fading but her skin looked blue<br>and every time I looked at it the song<br>in my head got a little louder the pull<br>a little stronger<br>I called in sick again<br>my manager texts to ask if I was all<br>right instead of replying I called the<br>Estates lawyer<br>Mr Wycliffe was very confused when I<br>told him I had come into some of<br>calliope's positions via her son<br>Miss Johnson was he told me down the<br>phone a spinster she never married and<br>she certainly never had any children who<br>would have been keeping her positions in<br>their spare room<br>did I think they were valuable he asked<br>stricken no I replied trying to sound<br>casual just some research papers but she<br>seemed like such a fascinating Woman<br>based on her research I implored and<br>didn't she live locally just down the<br>coast was there any chance a fellow<br>researcher could perhaps see her house<br>in any other papers the estate might<br>hold<br>Mr Wycliffe was not happy about this<br>unfortunately he told me he was a very<br>busy man in charge of several Estates<br>and accounts he would be unable to meet<br>me to tour her house<br>paused however<br>he saw no reason why I couldn't go to<br>her house and look around the property<br>it was after all a lovely example of<br>colonial architecture and even boasted<br>its own private Cove<br>he gave me her address and an awkward<br>silence hung in the air<br>I just had one last question I said<br>what happened to calliope<br>of Mr Wycliffe said his tone suddenly<br>soft<br>she drowned in that Cove you be careful<br>if you go out there he told me I said I<br>would and he hung up<br>the two hours I spent waiting for my<br>flatmate to get home so I could borrow<br>their car felt like years<br>but then I was leaving and I was going<br>and it felt right and the song in my<br>head was louder and clearer than ever<br>before and I almost didn't need my phone<br>snapping directions at me the pool was<br>so strong<br>come with me<br>the words turned over and over in my<br>head as I navigated the curves of the<br>peninsula their pool thrumming in my<br>ears<br>come where<br>the road eventually led to a dead end<br>with a small gate the only sign of<br>humanity amongst the flax and fern<br>I left the car and let the song Lead me<br>through the gate and down a steep gravel<br>path<br>the cottage was small all white worn<br>wood with a cherry Blue Door<br>I knew the cottage would not contain the<br>answers I was looking for<br>the gravel path LED down further among<br>rocks and long grasses until it revealed<br>the small Cove as promised<br>large rocks line the shore and I<br>clambered over them slipping as I<br>fumbled in my pocket I pulled out the<br>photo I had stolen the shoreline with<br>the figure floating in the water<br>holding it up I jumped between rocks<br>until the photo lined up with the coast<br>and Horizon<br>I lowered the photo and was met by an<br>almost exact replica as a head broke the<br>surface of the water in the exact spot<br>she had been photographed<br>did you know that only 15 percent of the<br>ocean has been explored by humans we<br>have explored more of space other<br>planets and the Stars than we have the<br>water beneath our feet<br>are we afraid to think below where light<br>can no longer penetrate<br>would we rather explore far reaches of<br>the cosmos where we might never see<br>another human again then dive into the<br>bathypelagic Zone The abyssopelagic Zone<br>into the trenches of the hetal pelagic<br>Zone<br>or were we stopped by some Primal<br>Instinct that knew what ancient<br>creatures of myth weight in the depths<br>telling us this world below is not for<br>us that we must stay within sight of the<br>bright reflective surface<br>we have always been afraid of the dark<br>stay above so what lives below doesn't<br>find you<br>I am staring at what lives below<br>she Bobs in the water and her head<br>slowly as she appraises me<br>I feel my own copy her movement<br>her skin is a mottled blue gray her eyes<br>abnormally large<br>her hair floats gently around her and<br>appears to have odd lights Tangled<br>through it<br>bioluminescent they give her a<br>compelling glow as she lies in weight<br>she moves slightly closer and I see the<br>tip of her tail breach the water behind<br>her<br>what are you doing here<br>as I hear her voice really here at this<br>time I realize that for the first time<br>in almost a week the song in my head is<br>silent<br>all I hear is my heart pounding in my<br>ears<br>oh I uh I found the cassette I hold up<br>the tape player strapped to the<br>waistband of my pants<br>with your song<br>oh she says it softly and a smile starts<br>to play across her face<br>she moves closer still right up to the<br>edge of the rocks<br>did you like it<br>I am already nodding when I notice that<br>beneath her delicate smile is a row of<br>needle sharp pointed teeth<br>I feel my whole body tense my flight<br>response trying to kick in I want to<br>step away<br>but she is beautiful in an ethereal<br>otherworldly way and I find my feet<br>moving closer to the edge<br>her wide eyes are dark pools and I see<br>myself reflected in them<br>I can sing you another she reaches out<br>of hand and I see her fingers are webbed<br>her nails Sharp but again I am nodding<br>and suddenly I am on my knees before her<br>supplicant my hands grasping the edge of<br>the rocks her hand rests atop mine<br>not cold as I expected but soft and a<br>little slimy though not unpleasant<br>this close I can see the gills on her<br>throat move in and out as she breathes<br>it doesn't even seem like her mouth<br>moves as I hear a new song full of that<br>same yearning<br>again there are no words only layered<br>Melodies but I still derive their<br>meaning<br>I feel the pull again I feel the need to<br>swim deeper than any person has before<br>to go below where light can reach I feel<br>like I will be safe there warm<br>wanted<br>home<br>will you come with me<br>the break in the song pulls me back to<br>reality and I feel myself pulling away<br>scrambling back up The Rock<br>the hurt is palpable in her face<br>aren't you Brave<br>I take a breath and shut my eyes<br>I am a librarian I am a historian is<br>that not a type of Explorer What If<br>instead of finding new worlds and books<br>I could find one for myself<br>I can be brave I say<br>looking behind me for a rock that will<br>be above the tideline I neatly stack my<br>boots rings and the tape player I take<br>out my phone and ping my location to my<br>flatmate so they can find their car and<br>then I set it in my shoes<br>I turn around<br>come with me she holds out a hand<br>imploring<br>again I kneel and I take her hand in my<br>own<br>she slowly pulls my hand arm and body<br>into the water<br>and she pulls me closer I'm Not Afraid<br>her song sings again in my head and I<br>know those teeth will not be used on me<br>our noses are almost touching now<br>come with me she Whispers it into my ear<br>and then I am pulled below thanks so<br>much Ginny that brings us to our final<br>winner our alumni short story winner<br>Rebecca Stiles Rebecca graduated in 2010<br>with an honors degree in English after<br>leaving otago she completed a masters in<br>creative writing at The International<br>Institute of modern letters and then a<br>PhD in creative writing at Massey<br>University<br>she's currently an investigative writer<br>at consumer New Zealand and teaches<br>short story writing part-time at<br>Wellington High School Community College<br>with all of that behind her it's no<br>wonder her entries stock levels stood<br>out to Craig<br>so Craig do tell us what's what Drew you<br>to this story<br>I think the first thing is it's got a<br>mystery what goes on in the toilet paper<br>aisle and that's a really good hook<br>that's a great elevator pitch that's<br>that's makes me want to read on it's<br>also got humor in it it's got<br>interesting characters so it's got all<br>the building blocks of a really good<br>story and I just found it immensely<br>enjoyable and thought provoking and I I<br>knew straight away that I was in good<br>hands and that once I found out that the<br>background of the author it all makes<br>sense<br>thanks Craig and now we can introduce<br>you to Rebecca Rebecca Styles welcome<br>Rebecca<br>hiya thanks for having me Rebecca what<br>inspired you to enter the competition<br>and to write your piece<br>um I think it was a combination of the<br>theme<br>um<br>it sort of I usually write quite realist<br>stuff really um and I guess that made me<br>um<br>experiment a bit and Branch out and I've<br>been I write a lot about consumer issues<br>like about privacy and<br>um<br>supermarket jopolies and this kind of<br>thing and that's it's kind of hard to<br>get people on board with the privacy<br>issues and I had been thinking for a<br>while that oh you know I think maybe<br>fiction is a better way to reach people<br>to see you know the worst case scenario<br>of no privacy data so um it was just a<br>bit of an experiment really<br>and the theme sort of Lent itself to<br>what I'd been thinking of so I just yeah<br>sat down and did it<br>thanks Rebecca and now we're going to<br>hear your winning story stock

can bring up the<br>customer's file which will have any<br>previous warnings for shoplifting<br>whether we've let them off or called the<br>police whether they've been banned<br>if we do clock someone coming in who's<br>been banned we ring security and they<br>escort them out<br>they scream usually when that happens<br>last week it was Verona Mill 35 who most<br>purchased items were two liters of blue<br>milk and cans of baked beans nappies are<br>her most expensive item she was caught<br>stealing depilatory cream<br>when the security guard apprehended her<br>he said she smelled like off milk<br>she had screamed at him there's nowhere<br>else to go how am I going to feed my<br>kids<br>she's right there is nowhere else to go<br>the closest supermarket is an hour's<br>Drive Away there's only two major chains<br>and this one where our work brought up<br>all the surrounding land so no<br>competitors can open up nearby<br>you can only hope that Verona has a<br>friend who can do a shopping for her<br>they're our customers we recognize<br>straight away regulars Teddy the 80 year<br>old who comes in Daily at 9am to buy a<br>fresh Half-Life White unsliced<br>these games and magazines flicks through<br>some pages reads an article or two but<br>never buys one before he heads to the<br>checkout<br>every Thursday he does a full shop which<br>only fills up half a trolley the items<br>week by week are near exact three tons<br>of whole tomatoes 500 grams of mince<br>kidney beans and a sachet of chili con<br>carne mix three bananas and two apples<br>easy cooked rice three sachets<br>the fluorescent lights shine on Teddy's<br>head he moves freely for an 80 year old<br>he just lives around the corner when we<br>match his grocery data with his power<br>data we can confirm he's frugal<br>he only hates one room the TV's on all<br>day the chili con carne is on the stove<br>for 40 minutes and the rice takes two<br>minutes and the microwave<br>the bread he eats for breakfast and<br>lunch the toast pops up after two<br>minutes he likes it quite crisp<br>his data isn't as valuable as others<br>household data of three or more people<br>is better to get an accurate picture of<br>the larger populations habits their<br>wants and needs what they do in their<br>spare time how long they're out for work<br>that's the data that gets the top price<br>because it can be mined for so many<br>variables<br>that's what David says anyway<br>while we send Teddy advertising on a<br>more balanced diet the analysis suggests<br>he's not eating a variety of fruit and<br>veg others we send more personal advice<br>Tracy a 45 year old public servant and<br>Mum we send skincare advice<br>her skin is prematurely aging too many<br>hours in the Sun the freckles and moles<br>could drink cancer as if she doesn't<br>take more care<br>and that way it's saving the Health Care<br>System valuable money it's preventative<br>there are other teams who check on<br>whether people are taking the advice<br>some commentators say we have too much<br>data that it's using people's private<br>information to punish them but when it's<br>saving money and People's Health it's a<br>bit hard to argue against<br>I've only been sent a few emails to<br>create my behavior therefore my own good<br>of course I don't fight it when I get it<br>not like some who don't even open the<br>emails but delete them straight away<br>there's no point in that really we can<br>tell when that happens it just means<br>someone will end up at your door to talk<br>you through some corrective Behavior<br>I must work on eating more protein it<br>doesn't have to be meat that email said<br>Dairy and non-dairy options are<br>available<br>I have been trying but it is expensive<br>all the protein I buy the recommended<br>amount each week at the supermarket<br>though I don't get through it all<br>sometimes which is a terrible waste and<br>sometimes I just can't get it down<br>I nearly gag on a steak or chicken but I<br>get encouraging emails telling me I'm<br>doing well<br>I don't feel any different health-wise<br>but the experts know best I guess they<br>say I'll have more energy and feel<br>Fuller for longer<br>Bob asked me about my protein levels<br>she's meant to cut back on sugar because<br>she's pre-diabetic while Deb needs to<br>get more exercise<br>easy said than done I can tell you says<br>Deb she's not terribly overweight just a<br>bit of extra padding you got to have<br>something to fall back on it says Deb Ed<br>the morning full supervisor stops as<br>he's passing you're probably getting an<br>email saying it's a myth who jokes<br>it starts work at 4am Monday to Saturday<br>Sunday they don't fill at the end of<br>every shift at 8am he comes up and<br>checks to Barb in the office it's quite<br>short just over five foot he doesn't<br>shave often his facial hair is about a<br>centimeter long and grows down his neck<br>over his Adam's apple<br>I wonder whether the display of<br>testosterone the facial hair suggests is<br>to compensate for his lack of height<br>he's friendly enough all right kid<br>there's this greeting to everyone except<br>it calls Barb and David by their names<br>it is always in charge of the toilet<br>paper aisle he fills it he might get one<br>of the younger ones to go up top and<br>push some stock down but he fills a<br>shelf<br>he was always very particular about the<br>right stock numbers it must be packed<br>there's always a run on it he said<br>the numbers back this up from all the<br>customer data toilet paper is the one<br>thing 95 of Shoppers Buy<br>no one likes to dwell on the toilet<br>habits of the other five percent<br>there can't be that many bidets you'd<br>said<br>the morning filler filmed of course yet<br>there are a few blind spots in the<br>supermarket a few Corners where the<br>cameras don't reach one is in the corner<br>of the bakery by the packs of pita bread<br>the other is down is in the first aisle<br>down by the toilet paper they've tried<br>many different angles to get a camera on<br>the area to no avail<br>aside from installing another camera for<br>those spots but the manager said that<br>would be Overkill<br>what could anyone possibly get away with<br>in that tight spot David asks<br>Barbara's always early to work it just<br>gives me a chance to catch my breath<br>she'll say when asked why she is so<br>early a chance to have a couple in peace<br>your two grown-up sons are at home and<br>one of them has a parent named baby who<br>is living there too it's a madhouse some<br>days but say smiling<br>after a Cabo she'll go over the tapes<br>just to see if anything under Ward<br>happened overnight<br>things have gone missing in the past she<br>says<br>foreign<br>what happens to the people who are<br>banned like Verona I asked Bob has been<br>playing on my mind at random moments<br>like when I'm cooking tea or standing at<br>the lights waiting for the cross signal<br>oh I wouldn't worry about her I'm sure<br>someone is looking after her but turns<br>around to face me from her screen where<br>she had just identified someone at the<br>chicken but who<br>family most likely I'm sure she's not<br>starving but I've picked up her tea and<br>took a sip<br>why are you so worried about her<br>well she had kids didn't she I mean it's<br>not just her but anyone banned the<br>nearest store is Miles Away<br>yes it's a shame all right but what can<br>you do she shrugs her shoulders and<br>turns back to the screen she shouldn't<br>have Nook stuff<br>it doesn't turn up for work on Monday<br>Barb looks worried where the hell is he<br>this isn't like him at all<br>when he doesn't tune up on Tuesday she<br>starts calling around and trawling<br>through data she puts her Quest into<br>Central data support for any recent<br>sightings they say they don't have any<br>sightings said she looks on the verge of<br>tears the bastards have got him what I<br>was surprised she swore and unsure who<br>it was that had him<br>deep swears too Jesus Christ what will<br>we do<br>the pairs stare at each other and I know<br>I'm missing something but I'm too scared<br>to ask what they tune to me at the same<br>time<br>how would you feel during a morning<br>shift just to fill in until it's back<br>that's bad it feels like they are sizing<br>me up I'm about the same height as it<br>just a bit thinner<br>well if that'll help sure<br>good I'll meet you at the side door at 4<br>00 a.m tomorrow says Bob I go to protest<br>she doesn't need to meet me but the<br>intent of her steer keeps me silent<br>yeah<br>I asked you because you seemed concerned<br>about people says Bob the following<br>morning standing outside the door to the<br>stock room right I was puzzled I didn't<br>think you needed to be worried about<br>people who fill some shelves<br>now before we go in I need to explain a<br>few rules that you was brisk and it was<br>so dark Bob's voice was disembodied you<br>need to do what I say no questions asked<br>and what you see in there you can't tell<br>anyone or else you might you might<br>disappear like you did okay<br>I know which of course Bob can't see in<br>the dark okay yes of course this<br>obviously isn't just about filling some<br>shells<br>the other morning Phil stuff look at me<br>with suspicion while Bob says good<br>morning to everyone<br>right so you'll be on toilet paper later<br>okay sure I see I'm not really knowing<br>if that was a good or bad thing<br>I'll help you this morning and then<br>you'll be on your own<br>it was what I expected at the start I<br>feel like the beans dried pasta and<br>canned soup then Bob takes me to the<br>toilet paper aisle there's a gap in the<br>toilet paper it almost looks like a door<br>to an igloo it's just big enough for me<br>to get into right you go through there<br>so said bam<br>I crouched down and go through the<br>opening I was just expecting to see some<br>toilet paper but what I found was stacks<br>of canned food milk powder pasta and<br>rice I turned back to Bar who follows me<br>into the Gap with some difficulty just<br>taller and a bit wider than me your body<br>not as pliable in small spaces<br>that's all the people who get banned we<br>back it up and send it out<br>at the far end of the cave there's a<br>door that leads out to the stock room<br>it's on camera but every morning Barb<br>wipes the footage from that area how<br>does the food get in here well it comes<br>out of the stock room and some boxes<br>just don't get put on the Shelf it's a<br>camera blind spot at the Loop paper so<br>every filler drops off a box on the way<br>to the Shelf it was solder and back it<br>up really to be shipped out how long has<br>this been going on<br>it's best you don't know but you can put<br>your mind at ease about band Shoppers<br>we're looking after them<br>but doesn't David notice the stock<br>levels it fudges the numbers some of the<br>drivers don't notice come off the truck<br>there are ways<br>after my initial surprise I got down to<br>work putting groceries into bags<br>the head of accounts was in on it too<br>she'd make the stock tape figures merry<br>with what had been sold<br>all the health tips they give us has<br>made us so sharp we know how to get<br>around the system blah blast<br>so began my covert morning film<br>we never saw it again Bob said he'd been<br>in touch with her<br>he could feel them circling so he went<br>off bridge we won't see him anytime soon<br>she said she had a worried look on her<br>eyes whether that was from missing Ed or<br>wondering whether she'd have to do the<br>same thing one day I wasn't sure<br>what would they do if they got them<br>they don't share that data she shrugs no<br>one really knows what happens to people<br>who try to live off grid they're not<br>valuable then if they're not producing<br>data to be sold they become expendable<br>I nod knowing that one day I could be<br>Expendable too<br>thanks Rebecca<br>that brings us now to the end of our<br>show thank you all for listening we're<br>just going to
