John hosking I'm<br>dean of science here at the University<br>of Auckland it's my very great pleasure<br>to welcome you to the university and to<br>the inaugural lecture of Telo suno who's<br>from the school of chemical Sciences<br>Telo is a solid state in organic chemist<br>which means he understands chemical<br>problems such as the structures of<br>inorganic crystals or powders by using<br>tools such as synchrotrons x-rayed<br>fractometers or electron microscopes to<br>expose samples of chemicals to beams of<br>for example<br>photons neutrons or electron<br>putting it another way he uses big bits<br>of Kit to understand tiny structures<br>he also develops Theory to predict and<br>understand what he sees<br>well<br>the world is hungry for new materials<br>whether for new types of high densities<br>data storage devices new types of<br>catalyst for industrial processes or for<br>new technologies yet to be developed<br>till owners collaborators are at the<br>Forefront of satisfying that hunger<br>doing the really fundamental work<br>required to understand what those new<br>materials are and what they might be<br>useful for<br>Dilo is born on Dresden and started as<br>academic life they're doing as<br>undergraduate Masters and doctorate at<br>the Dresden University of Technology<br>his bachelor's overlapping the<br>reunification of Germany his Doctorate<br>finishing a few years before the 800th<br>anniversary of the city<br>so it's been going for a while<br>a series of postdocs including two years<br>here in Auckland on a theater lineman<br>Fellowship followed before he was lured<br>back here to a lectureship in chemistry<br>bringing with him his wife Catherine<br>where is Catherine hi Catherine<br>who is now a senior recruitment<br>consultant here at the University<br>so while tilo sheds light on Tiny<br>structures to find useful new materials<br>Catherine sheds light on voluminous CVS<br>to find useful new academics<br>here tilo has built a world-class<br>inorganic solid-state chemistry lab from<br>scratch and a process building a<br>substantial research group and extensive<br>International collaborations<br>he was awarded a university early career<br>Excellence ward in 2006 perhaps to<br>celebrate the actual 800th birthday of<br>Dresden<br>demonstrating the potential it is has<br>led to his promotion to Professor<br>it's also been an enthusiastic educator<br>bringing substantial curriculum and<br>teaching delivery reform to materials<br>chemistry<br>pastoral care for students is<br>exceptional most notably via his current<br>role as associate Dean postgraduate<br>Masters and taught<br>he took on this role just as covert<br>struck<br>in the past two and a half to three<br>years has seen him deal with many<br>difficult situations that students have<br>found themselves in due to the impact of<br>lockdowns and other covert imposed<br>constraints<br>I am very grateful for the service Telo<br>has provided to both students and the<br>faculty during this period as are the<br>many students who have benefited from<br>his advice and care<br>but we're here to celebrate tilo's<br>success in his promotion and for him to<br>tell us a little bit about the big kit<br>and Tiny structures that are his<br>oh well thanks John you took half my<br>introduction away from here but it's<br>fine<br>yeah<br>in order Alexis I mean<br>if you talk to a lot of other people who<br>gave inaugural lectures before you can<br>talk as many people as you want and<br>everyone gives you a different opinion<br>how you should structure that<br>so then at some point decided okay I<br>stop listening to people and just do my<br>own<br>and I decided<br>and give you a little bit of an<br>introduction where I'm from<br>in this shown already he told you I'm<br>clearly not from New Zealand and you can<br>hear that<br>and Chester embarrass my children a<br>little bit they keep telling me Oh your<br>accent is so terrible it sounds so funny<br>when you're talking English<br>okay that's fine<br>um<br>says again as John mentioned I'm<br>born and bred and Dresden Dresden<br>which is in the eastern part of Germany<br>and um<br>again I wanted to say this as well<br>that's been around for a long time it's<br>about 180 years under 100 years old<br>and actually has been capital of what we<br>know as a state of Saxony now since the<br>13th century<br>a long long long time so very old lots<br>of lots of History<br>yeah I studied their chemistry at a<br>Technical University finished my PhD in<br>97 in inorganic chemistry so I'll say<br>chemistry<br>sounds kind of easy and straightforward<br>but it was anything<br>else than that<br>and the reason why<br>and again I have to keep referring back<br>to John<br>because when I started<br>studying<br>you can see this here I still have that<br>that was a little piece of paper which I<br>was sent<br>from the University telling me yes you<br>finally at the University and you can<br>start studying<br>yeah it's quite a while ago right<br>that was 88 1988<br>and if you think about this that was<br>it is interesting times to say it at<br>least<br>because that was one year<br>before the ball came down that was two<br>years before the German<br>reunification we'll come back to that in<br>a second<br>nevertheless I was told yes I can study<br>chemistry and what I can do is<br>for fun shimmy which is sort of<br>process chemistry or kind of technical<br>chemistry you had no choice<br>I was told that's what you're going to<br>do<br>okay<br>it changed somehow<br>anyhow<br>there was something else coming with<br>that<br>and for everyone who can't really read<br>German<br>I translated there if it's ever coming<br>to appear here we go<br>and it says obligation studying at the<br>Technical University address is an honor<br>and an honorable social Duty<br>I undertake to complete my studies at<br>the Technical University<br>consciously aware of my responsibility<br>to the Socialist father man the gdr to<br>acquire maximum of knowledge and so on<br>and so on and so on and so on<br>last one<br>as a graduate I undertake to work where<br>the greatest benefit for our gdr will<br>arise<br>okay 1988.<br>as I said two years later<br>by saying this<br>that was a interesting time<br>it was a difficult time<br>the time which came with a lot of<br>challenges<br>um because if you think about it it was<br>again it was 88 growing up and the<br>conditions like that<br>one year later<br>okay the wall is there<br>you can go wherever you want<br>and two years later we had a German<br>running for unification<br>and you changed from a place where you<br>were forced to think the way they wanted<br>you to think they were forced to talk<br>you are not allowed to ask questions<br>which aren't appropriate<br>etc etc<br>and two years later what's the complete<br>opposite you could do whatever you<br>wanted you can<br>tell whatever you wanted to say<br>forced by anyone to speak and he said<br>well whatever<br>that was a change<br>and that for a very young<br>adult with just 18 or 19 years old<br>yeah you can imagine<br>but while all of that was happening we<br>I have something here<br>that little thing<br>that's what you probably would call a<br>there's a little piece of paper<br>and you can see there was just a list of<br>stuff written on it<br>and that was my lab menu who said okay<br>go ahead do it<br>that was inorganic chemistry lab<br>I think it was in year two probably<br>yesterday I can't remember<br>yeah<br>that's all they gave you<br>go to the library pick up the books find<br>out how to make this stuff and you know<br>come back<br>talk to me or the<br>GTA as we would call it nowadays<br>oh that was fun<br>um one thing I want to talk about<br>because then sort of sort of a defining<br>moment of what I did later on<br>it's the very first one is iron<br>and it says alamina Tell me afterwards<br>okay where was I oh iron<br>that's my lap report from 98 whatever<br>about this very first experiment we did<br>and if you<br>suggest to the health and safety person<br>to do something like that nowadays<br>very short and simple answer would be no<br>and probably at the dwarf go away<br>that is what we did<br>the making a iron is very simple you<br>take aluminum<br>that reacts with iron oxide<br>to give a little bit of heat I mean a<br>lot of heat<br>and it breaks two iron and aluminum<br>oxide<br>yes it falls are good<br>but to get this started<br>you need a mixture<br>didn't ignite the zoo and that is barium<br>peroxide and magnesium<br>two compounds one which is so happy to<br>give oxygen away I think it's relatively<br>unstable and he had a long magnesium of<br>course is so happy to take that away<br>yeah<br>so if that gets started it produces a<br>lot of heat but that's the heat you need<br>to get the first reaction started<br>and to get that going you have to have a<br>little bit of potassium permanganate<br>sitting here a little bit of glycerol<br>that reacts relatively quickly<br>produces some heat that gives the heat<br>for that<br>that heat gets the whole thing going<br>that's fun<br>and what we did do back then<br>we did this experiment outside our<br>chemistry building there was a hole in<br>the ground<br>and you had this little bucket with all<br>that stuff in it<br>you put it in that hole you had a long<br>prepared with a little bit of glittering<br>in it<br>uh glycerol<br>a little bit of uh glycerol I did a few<br>drops<br>and then you run away<br>and if everything worked well<br>a minute later half a minute later you<br>saw the Flames coming out<br>I was a good and fine it means yep did<br>work perfect<br>if it did not work that well<br>that whole thing turned to a little<br>rocket<br>and it was flying out and ended up in<br>the window on the other side of the<br>building<br>and I tell you it did happen<br>that's fun and games and when we did<br>this I thought yes that is what I want<br>to do<br>so that answers your question why did<br>sort of say chemistry that's actually<br>one of the reasons<br>that was really fun<br>the other one here that's what I want to<br>that's my Lipton and pentachloride very<br>easy to do and that's just for my<br>students<br>is they keep poking them<br>about seeding quartz juice which you use<br>and that you do this properly and okay<br>but this one here you have to use<br>molytium a little bit CO2 on top it's<br>very easy to do<br>but<br>um<br>that stuff is hydroscopic<br>so you have to seal it in tubes<br>okay that's my lab report from back then<br>translated you still need a lot of<br>practice to fill the tube so that you<br>that was how it looked in our lab<br>it's a little bit too bright in here<br>yeah so how's the health and safety<br>what's our house and safety<br>it had a different meaning back then<br>let's say this<br>so I started and finished my studies in<br>93<br>but um<br>and then started my PhD<br>when I said now we were allowed to go<br>anywhere<br>and a few of us five or six I'll<br>remember<br>she made our dream come true and came to<br>New Zealand for a holiday<br>and<br>it's not an understatement that was a<br>life-changing experience<br>because without a shadow of the doubt<br>this six weeks while we're here<br>that made me fall in love with this<br>country this is no doubt about it<br>I always wanted to come back<br>speaking about health and safety the<br>champagne pool again it looks a bit<br>different nowadays<br>so that was a critical moment not just a<br>moment a critical six weeks and I loved<br>so as I said and I finished my PhD in 97<br>stayed in Dresden for a few more years<br>as a research assistant postdoc I also<br>took up this beautiful job of being the<br>I.T guy in the department<br>dealing with all these wonderful Windows<br>computers<br>we were eating up a lot of my time<br>but a few years later I went on the<br>postdoc to the max Bank Institute in<br>Stuttgart<br>and um<br>Siemens group<br>that's him and that's on semen is one of<br>their<br>true one of the Godfathers or solid<br>state chemistry<br>in Germany<br>and he gave the talking Dresden<br>and you see he explained<br>magnetic interactions and this is a nice<br>anti-ferromagnetic ordering and he<br>actually used wine bottles to explain<br>that that is something which actually<br>gets stuck in your hair<br>and he even has a little default in it<br>you see that bottle is not the same as<br>the others<br>um so I stayed in this group I've got to<br>know<br>a little bit better which are very good<br>again a few years later no actually not<br>few years later the same year but later<br>I came to Auckland and that's when I<br>said yes hi I'm back<br>uh and joined Peter's group Peter<br>schwetfeger<br>yeah 20 years ago<br>looks a bit different nowadays<br>um<br>and he was the one who effectively<br>introduced me to Quantum Mechanics<br>because he said I need someone who does<br>quantum mechanics and solid materials I<br>don't I do quantum mechanics but I'm<br>need someone to combine the two<br>yeah so I did<br>learned a lot with a whole lot of very<br>very nice stuff during his time<br>mostly around gold and to figure out why<br>gold behaves differently too<br>cover on gold<br>we've got a very nice uncommon to paper<br>beside a lot of other things as well<br>okay but saying this<br>that was 20 years ago I was in<br>calculations 20 years ago took an awful<br>long lot longer than they do nowadays I<br>mean every single mobile phone has more<br>computer power than what we had as a<br>supercomputer<br>so we had a quite a bit of time to do<br>that<br>and<br>yeah we really appreciated New Zealand<br>okay let's get rid of that<br>okay then I went back to Germany first<br>to another Max Planck Institute for a<br>little while or short while and then I<br>joined Michelle Brooks group in Dresden<br>I hope you can see that that's give me a<br>look<br>that's me<br>not looking particularly happy<br>but I can tell you why because we tend<br>to do these little<br>things nine o'clock in the morning and<br>everyone who knows me<br>nah<br>that is not my time at all<br>ever<br>anyhow we did some very nice chemistry<br>so effectively applied what I learned in<br>the year before and<br>Peter's Groove and did some Theory<br>and that stuff is particularly nice<br>because that's now textbook knowledge<br>it's really ended up<br>in house craft in organic chemistry<br>textbook<br>right<br>they're by far most important part of<br>that time was that I<br>got to know someone really really<br>special<br>and come back to that<br>yeah 2004<br>well 2003 in fact I had the chance to<br>come back to New Zealand as a lecture<br>and after some long long nights with no<br>sleep and lots of discussions<br>we finally decided okay let's do it and<br>we go back to New Zealand<br>so we arrived in 2004<br>and um<br>yeah times in 2004 were a little bit<br>different than they are nowadays<br>I think the first thing I was told when<br>I arrived was<br>oh by the way you have to prepare<br>lectures for four different lectures for<br>different<br>series of lectures in the first year<br>okay<br>that's a bit different<br>and then two weeks later I started<br>teaching analytical chemistry for<br>engineers<br>I have a very good relationships to my<br>colleagues and chemical materials<br>engineering now so it didn't harm too<br>much<br>still that situation brought a little<br>bit of<br>stopped a whole lot of other things I<br>wanted to do<br>but again as Jim mentioned already two<br>years later someone within the<br>university seemed to have some sort of<br>faith in this newly appointed person<br>and they gave me the early career<br>research Excellence award<br>which was really appreciated because it<br>came with some much much much needed<br>funding money<br>so at least we got that started here we<br>one two there<br>what the hell<br>uh we had three children and<br>then I came back here<br>and you remember that that has these<br>very nice BSF laps which we used to have<br>and hopefully we'll have again I don't<br>know<br>so after spending 20 minutes on what I'm<br>doing where I'm from<br>finally getting somewhere about what I'm<br>doing<br>okay I do solid set chemistry and I gave<br>you one reason why<br>I was wrecked into it it was a wonderful<br>nice left in the beginning of our<br>undergrad so what do we do<br>so it's always a chemistry has something<br>to do with like a Stones why<br>yeah what I stands mostly in the outside<br>they have heaps of metal in it silicon<br>aluminum for that matter<br>and that that's pretty much what we do<br>we make oxides<br>and um so we're interested in these kind<br>of stuff<br>if you ever go to the<br>probably have been to te Papa<br>down in Wellington they have a nice<br>outside exhibition<br>and they show you these big things here<br>nice rocks<br>somewhere from New Zealand<br>that one here is a granite<br>big granite rock which is chemically<br>mostly feldspar<br>which is a potassium aluminum silica<br>yeah so far is it good<br>but what always strikes me is that fact<br>here<br>that stone is an incredible 300 million<br>years old<br>and I have some which are even older<br>which are half a billion years old<br>yeah but the question is<br>how it is and virtually how on Earth<br>can they survive for so long<br>why don't they change why don't they<br>decompose why don't they fall apart<br>whatever<br>why is that<br>and of course it must have something to<br>do with the properties of these<br>materials<br>it must have something to do with what's<br>inside these materials the elements how<br>they arranged<br>hot and cool tonight so what the<br>structures<br>so the question is of course How does<br>the structure relate to the properties<br>of the material<br>coming back to something which I keep<br>annoying my students were<br>and that is nothing else that will be<br>called a structural property<br>relationship and that's pretty much<br>whatever your chemist does<br>but that's what we do on materials like<br>that to explain why they exist<br>how the properties come where they come<br>from and if you change things how you<br>a few obvious ones here so why do we do<br>this<br>let's of course the go-to example right<br>listen battery but at least in batteries<br>and phones and we all have that<br>I mean I'm old enough but I was on the<br>wrong side of the Iron Curtain so we did<br>so the chemistry of the but the<br>batteries and these ones are of course<br>very very different to the lithium<br>batteries<br>and if I remember correctly there was<br>last year<br>in the last year when the Nobel Prize in<br>chemistry was given to the people who<br>discovered lithium batteries<br>and one of the three was Professor good<br>enough<br>which is turned an incredible hundred<br>years<br>just recently<br>and he's still alive and<br>According to some rumors he's still<br>so that is a huge development do we have<br>anything to do with this yes we do in<br>some soul and Tim is sitting there so he<br>just submitted his PhD a few weeks ago<br>and he was looking at some materials to<br>make his listing but she's a little bit<br>more<br>yeah<br>um and he's working on materials which<br>are actually aimed to replace the<br>lithium batteries<br>so yes we do something in there another<br>nice example is of course the storage<br>materials for data I mean we produce an<br>enormous amount of data every second and<br>they have to be stored somewhere<br>okay that is how it all started with a<br>good old magnetic types hard drives<br>floppy disks for people who are old<br>enough<br>and they're all based on magnetic<br>materials so we magnetize the material<br>and demagnetize them relatively simple<br>yeah that's fun here 20 Gigabytes<br>two tons million dollars<br>that has changed<br>so<br>quite a few years ago these things came<br>up and of course you have to should have<br>a CD here as well<br>completely different storage mechanism<br>you see that we call this a phase change<br>material so you go from a material which<br>has a crystal structure to an amorphism<br>and back and forth and that's how you<br>um and they're almost gone still around<br>but<br>so we're somewhere here<br>and we can store a lot more data but<br>again the mechanism has changed again<br>now we use thermoelectric materials<br>and we all know these little discs here<br>and solid state hard drive synchronous<br>watch so they're all based on these<br>materials and techniques<br>did we do something about that yes we do<br>we're sitting somewhere here<br>and and looking at materials which<br>potentially at some stage in decades to<br>come<br>and I mean it<br>could potentially be used as a storage<br>material for all<br>much much much much faster computers as<br>we have now<br>quantum computers comes up all the time<br>because they will be so fast<br>did you need something to store data in<br>okay<br>I have to show Dan yes and that's the<br>other thing which actually fascinated me<br>and ride from the start which is<br>superconductivity<br>in my view one of the most exciting<br>properties materials can show<br>you hear superconductivity means that<br>you can conduct power without<br>resistivity<br>you don't lose anything<br>which is weird because it contradicts<br>everything we know about electrons or<br>any charged particles is they tend to<br>interact with each other<br>and electrons are negatively charged so<br>they have a repositive force now they<br>don't want to talk to each other<br>at all<br>so when they travel around in a metal<br>for example and they move of course they<br>start bumping into each other and the<br>faster they move the faster they do this<br>or more often it means our resistivity<br>goes up simple as that I mean so<br>and you would never ever expect that to<br>change but it does<br>so in some materials if you go down in<br>temperature if you go low enough the<br>electrons all of a sudden decide yeah we<br>change this we don't want to repulse<br>each other anymore we actually pair up<br>performed these famous Cooper pairs<br>and all of a sudden the oldest say<br>again this is very different what you<br>learn if you do quantum mechanics in a<br>Basics quantum mechanics course and<br>that's every electron is a different<br>Quantum state<br>now they're all in the same they all<br>have the same energy they're all sitting<br>in the same Quantum state<br>and that's what you call a Bose Einstein<br>condensation<br>and this is Magic this is just magic<br>because if you do this and these things<br>here made by our materials chemistry<br>students in stage three it was<br>um so it's easy enough to have this in<br>the lab<br>and they made this and this is a magnet<br>here with tiny magnets but very strong<br>magnets<br>and the silver conducting material<br>actually expels the magnetic field of<br>these magnets<br>well I float<br>they fly<br>oh I have a video here I'm not sure if<br>you actually can see it<br>that adds a little bit space between the<br>magnets and the tablet<br>but again why do I do this why do I tell<br>you that<br>the reason why I'm telling you that<br>because that is the very very first<br>solid state experiment I ever did and<br>that was at the end of my first year<br>after two semesters we had a nice little<br>compulsory<br>research lab of three weeks in the<br>I mean you couldn't say no<br>and what I did was he had a magic<br>titration of the oxygen content of that<br>stuff here that's how it all started<br>there you go do we use this stuff of<br>course we do everyone who was inside an<br>MRI at some stage it wouldn't work<br>without superconducting magnet<br>as always a nice example here this<br>magnif trains<br>that is the German version as a Japanese<br>version a German version It's the only<br>thing which is actually operational at<br>the moment with the Shanghai airport so<br>if you go to Shanghai that's the train<br>and I thought that was the end of the<br>story but no a few years ago a prototype<br>in China appeared<br>and that's that one here<br>and a year ago it actually made it out<br>of the garage<br>so there's obviously testing track<br>somewhere<br>let's see how that works I mean this is<br>frightening here<br>traveling with 600k in a tray<br>but it works in the very same way as we<br>just showed you with this little tablet<br>and magnet it's exactly the same thing<br>just significantly bigger<br>and so much more expensive<br>so what do we do that we do a whole lot<br>of different things<br>and materials and I can't go through<br>them and this list is not complete but I<br>just want to talk about two of those<br>today at the time and come back to this<br>stuff here<br>talking about synchrotron's photons<br>Etc<br>and I will go over time I know that<br>so what is that funny thing called<br>synchrotron<br>that funny thing called synchrotron is<br>effectively a particle accelerator<br>I'm sorry many of you have heard about<br>particle accelerators especially the one<br>in Switzerland CERN<br>and hicksburg Sun story and all of that<br>but<br>that's different<br>so asynchron is a particle accelerator<br>where you actually accelerate electrons<br>and the story is really old you can see<br>you see a theory about that is 100 years<br>old<br>that's why I said yeah things like that<br>should actually work<br>the first one I ever built was in the<br>40s<br>and that is that thing here<br>very small you can put it on a table<br>that was the very first synchrogen so to<br>speak<br>and then it took off and there's a<br>little was a significantly bigger one in<br>Berkeley just a few years later<br>what we have nowadays is very different<br>we have many of them I think we have 70<br>plus in the world<br>and well only two<br>not even two just one closest enough to<br>rest and that is that one here and<br>that's the Australian Central Melbourne<br>and thanks to the New Zealand government<br>who spent some money on that<br>so you see that's the round building so<br>what does a synchrotron do as I said you<br>accelerate electrons<br>and you accelerate electrons to nearly<br>the speed of light<br>so really to<br>99.999 of speed of light<br>and you force the electrons to run<br>around in circles<br>if the electrons would be as fast and it<br>just go straight<br>yeah it wouldn't be bothered too much<br>and as we force them to run around the<br>so they desperately trying to change<br>them in very simple ways<br>and the way to do this for the electrons<br>is to get rid of energy<br>that's the only thing they can do<br>and<br>well that's my next slide<br>so they're trying to get rid of energy<br>photons just to use this word from my<br>title<br>so it adds a picture just from inside<br>the synchrotron the Australian<br>synchrotron so there's a little little<br>that's about this size it's just an<br>electron gun<br>and the electrons coming out there's a<br>linear accelerator and you end up with<br>about 99 of speed of light just within a<br>few meters<br>and then they get pumped in a ring which<br>is the booster ring and you see there's<br>one thing after the other and these are<br>magnets the superconducting magnets and<br>they accelerate the electrons to nearly<br>speed of light<br>so at this point here this boost ring<br>is connected to<br>this so-called storage ring here<br>let me see the storage ring stars of a<br>lot of stuff big things and that's our<br>experimental stations so I said<br>that's what's happening so it is an<br>extremely bright light coming out of<br>there so that's what the electrons emit<br>and this is the whole Spectrum going<br>from very energy<br>high energy x-rays gamma rays to radio<br>waves without hardly any energy<br>whatsoever I have a little bit sure but<br>anything in between<br>and for whatever experiment you want to<br>do whatever little piece off that<br>Spectrum where I want to use you filter<br>that out and you do your experiments<br>with<br>and we make use of that and not going<br>through this list needs another hour all<br>we do is we can do so many things with<br>that<br>no matter what we do is of course this<br>little part here is a deal with<br>materials and try to characterize our<br>materials which we may<br>okay and I have 20 odd 25 minutes to go<br>through my examples for that oh good<br>luck<br>so the first thing I want to introduce<br>you is what I call perfect frustration<br>and the reason why I'm showing you this<br>example is it because it spans over so<br>many years it effectively started with<br>my own PhD then disappeared for some<br>years and we brought it back because all<br>of a sudden we did understand more about<br>that stuff years later which we just<br>didn't see before<br>I deal with something which is called<br>clusters it's a very special<br>Arrangements of atoms and my group<br>should recognize what that is because<br>that would we use as a<br>group logo effectively<br>and we can make a whole lot of compounds<br>and they're mostly based around tin<br>and one company I want to talk about is<br>this one here which has a very strange<br>composition with lots of iron in it<br>silicon tin Etc<br>and the reason why it's interesting is<br>because it has two different Iron<br>sitting instruction one sitting here and<br>the other one sitting here<br>and if you do a little bit of chemistry<br>and physics you learn about what the<br>Heisman and low spin state is so there's<br>a different arrangement of the electrons<br>in your petals stage two sort of thing<br>and um<br>but the funny part is that you have<br>these two situations coexisting at the<br>same time in one compound it doesn't<br>really happen that often<br>at least not in the fashion that they<br>are nicely separate<br>so I was talking about structural<br>property relationships that's what we're<br>interested in so okay<br>if we play with the metals in this<br>structure so if you replace iron with<br>something else does it have an impact on<br>the properties does it change the<br>magnetism what does it do<br>okay and so we did<br>and we found a few very very interesting<br>things<br>why do we want to do this on this<br>particular compound<br>that's the reason if you just take this<br>layer here get rid of all the oxygen<br>these are these atoms here and just look<br>at the metals you end up with this<br>picture<br>and that picture is called a kagame<br>layer<br>the cargo made the name of cargo mate<br>comes from that is actually it comes<br>from Japanese the combination of these<br>two words<br>and these are these little these baskets<br>here and if you look at this the<br>coordination of the basket this is<br>exactly the same pattern that is where<br>the name cargamel letters is coming from<br>and cargo man letters is going to be<br>found in many compounds but there aren't<br>that many we have one of two dimensional<br>layer of those just sitting in there<br>isolated from everything else<br>okay so why is this interesting why do<br>you even talk about this these cargo<br>mail layers are the perfect examples for<br>magnetic frustration<br>and as is<br>it is very clearly from this triangle so<br>if you have a spin of one atom going out<br>the other one is going down<br>yeah what's the third one doing<br>up down nothing one huh left right<br>so you end up with a frustrated system<br>and frustrated systems are always<br>interesting you can you can imply it for<br>so that's why we looked at that<br>talking about spin orientation<br>again littlewood stage two stuff<br>um that is what we call a ferromagnetic<br>so you see all the spins are looking the<br>same direction they're all the same and<br>an anti-ferromagnet you see one up one<br>down left right so they all cancel each<br>other out<br>and you have all sorts of situations<br>sitting between the two which you can<br>describe as a spin glass if you want<br>and you see okay and they are ordered in<br>the way they are but they're different<br>to those they are like Dad but not the<br>same as this you have so here's some<br>local ordering but you have no long<br>range of ordering<br>and that's where we describe as a spin<br>glass<br>at different types of it on it going<br>there<br>so that's how you could draw that and<br>again I'm not talking about this too<br>much so they could pair up and you see<br>they can pair they can Pan the one<br>sitting in the middle doesn't know what<br>to do<br>that's fine there's a typical behavior<br>of these kind of frustrated systems<br>I found someone<br>kawakawa<br>there's any famous toilets<br>in kawakawa<br>and if you look at this<br>they all looking down<br>they are looking up so it's nicely<br>anti-ferromagnetic<br>same here up down<br>yeah and then it starts becoming a<br>little bit messy some ups and downs are<br>sort of spin glass here<br>yeah if you go down next time<br>I'm pretty sure you'll look at this in a<br>anyhow<br>so these are the materials we can make<br>beautiful materials nice crystals that's<br>fine and then you go to the synchrotron<br>and that is one of the beam lines of the<br>synchrotron which is the part of the<br>fraction beam line<br>quite a few years ago so<br>hiding there<br>um<br>so it's all much bigger than what I'd be<br>doing to that but it's fine when you get<br>out it looks boring<br>just a few lines and they all look the<br>same but to be honest if you look very<br>closely in their hands<br>so they're actually shifting so we<br>learned something from what we do there<br>is what we call part of diffraction<br>pattern so the doping obviously has an<br>impact on the structure<br>and that's actually what we want to see<br>and there's something to do with the<br>radii of the irons<br>not really time to talk about this if<br>you do the same thing with Cobalt the<br>picture changes a little bit so we learn<br>something different so if you do a<br>different metal combinations different<br>things are happening and that's what<br>these measurements actually tell us<br>I love these pictures<br>that is one of two of our former<br>students<br>working at different uh absorption x-ray<br>absorption as again syncretion that is<br>not in Melbourne<br>actually one is in the United States<br>that one here<br>and that one is the Korean signature<br>it's just fun it looks messy but it's<br>just fun working<br>and again you get boring lines out of it<br>yes<br>but again you learn something about the<br>state of other ions and destruction and<br>why they are different<br>and again if you do a little<br>mathematical trick which is just the<br>first derivative which is very simple<br>but you clearly see the difference<br>between the ions in the structure and<br>that's what we want to study at the<br>where's Joe<br>oh there he is hiding in the back so<br>that's his job at the moment<br>we do the theory and all of that do you<br>understand why this is behaving like<br>this<br>the other thing we are interested in is<br>magnetism<br>and that picture here is an iron<br>compound<br>which is magnetized<br>iron three or four and a naturally<br>magnetized version of magnetizers is<br>that notice stones<br>and that has been known to mankind a<br>humankind for thousands of years<br>the reason why it's called magnetism the<br>magnetite is something to do with the<br>place what else has been found which<br>isn't<br>um<br>the modern state of turkey but the Greek<br>tribe which used to live there<br>pretty much the name the same name of<br>magnetite and magnetism so that is where<br>this name is coming from it's always<br>funny to read these stories and they<br>learn a little bit of History<br>right<br>okay anyhow so we want to do know how<br>structure behaves magnetically<br>it means we want to know how these spins<br>behave how they look like so we need to<br>probe<br>you need something which interacts with<br>these spins<br>and the thing which we use to interact<br>with these spins of actions are neutrons<br>they have no charge I don't have to spin<br>so the spin can interact with the spin<br>of the electron so we can find something<br>out how these electrons actually are<br>organized in the structure what you need<br>for that is a reactor producing neutrons<br>it's just a research reactor which is a<br>tiny baby reactor the rectal core itself<br>is about the size of a bucket<br>there's nothing to do with the thermal<br>reactors you have when you produce power<br>very different story it's a very very<br>tiny baby reactor and the nutrients come<br>out of the nuclear decay of a uranium<br>and you drill a hole in this bucket and<br>that's where the nutrients are coming<br>out as simple as that<br>and again we do a whole lot of different<br>measurements characterization techniques<br>based on that one is a diffraction<br>method and the Australians called<br>instruments after their animals and the<br>one instrument you've used as echidna<br>you see it now is echidna that is the<br>detector<br>it is massive right it is a very very<br>big thing and that's because nutrients<br>react with matter only much less than<br>photons and electrons do<br>saying it's bigger detectors okay that<br>looks pretty messy but still you learn<br>something from it and in this particular<br>case we learned how the magnetic<br>frustration looks like<br>and it's funny because you see there is<br>a triangle<br>two of the three<br>participate in this frustration one goes<br>up one goes down a little bit canted<br>that's fine<br>and the third one says Nah don't want to<br>have anything to do with it<br>and just don't order at all<br>so that's how nature in this case solves<br>this magnetic frustration<br>well we have learned in the last few<br>years that if you change the composition<br>so if your changes from Iron to<br>manganese that doesn't change much<br>but for example if you go from Silicon<br>to Germania it just sits underneath<br>which is not magnetic at all but it has<br>an impact on the magnetism<br>which is weird but it must have<br>something to do with the size of designs<br>so again structural property<br>relationships I keep saying that<br>just a few words about a different<br>system we had a play with antimony<br>rather than tin<br>and if you look through the periodic<br>table and the periodic table is big<br>but on the other hand if you want to do<br>something very specific<br>all of a sudden you realize no it's not<br>big it's by far too small we need more<br>elements<br>you seriously do<br>right anyhow if you go from tune to<br>antimony you have one election more<br>which does change a few things<br>and change oxidation Stone but you only<br>have very very few compounds between<br>transition metal and antimony it's not a<br>whole lot<br>here<br>she loves to do memes and so I had to<br>include one of her memes<br>and what she has done in her PhD is to<br>look at something<br>here it has a very specific composition<br>is that was proposed to replace what's<br>called Ito which is indium tin oxide and<br>that is what you have in every mobile<br>phone and every<br>portable device that is this little nice<br>thin layer of an electronic material I<br>mean you can actually touch that and<br>makes this to a touchpad so you need<br>that<br>engine being expensive and rare or the<br>other way around being very rare and for<br>that reason being expensive you want to<br>replace it with something else so you<br>need a transparent material which<br>contacts<br>and these two things<br>completely contradict each other that's<br>why we have so few compounds which<br>actually showed its properties and<br>that's why we still use idea so we want<br>to replace it with something else<br>and that was made playing with replacing<br>intimidating with tin playing with the<br>charges a little bit and hoping to get<br>some oxygen defects in there and the<br>defects do the trick eventually because<br>it conducts better<br>very small changes and that's why we use<br>synchrotron again and that's what you<br>can see here so don't worry too much<br>about it the absolute changes in the<br>structure so tiny that you don't see it<br>as of any lap instruments so you need<br>something much better than that so we<br>okay in the interest of time I skipped<br>down<br>in the last example I want to show in<br>is something which is even more<br>fascinating well absolutely fascinating<br>I shouldn't say even more everything is<br>fascinating<br>but that is the tiny little bit extra<br>um scamions<br>some people in my group can't hear this<br>word anymore because we keep talking<br>about scorpions all the time<br>what are they<br>scary and uh particles which are<br>actually made out of spins<br>very strange<br>so they're quasi-party because they've<br>had real party is that quasi-part thing<br>isn't it made out of spins and they have<br>been predicted from scrum in the 60s so<br>that's been theoretically known for a<br>long time<br>but surprise surprise they would have<br>been detected by Neutron diffraction<br>again you talk about spins magnetisms<br>you need something to detect that and we<br>go back to neutrons and it's not that<br>long time ago it's just a decade ago<br>that it had been found<br>but since then<br>a huge boom started and a whole lot of<br>people actually started looking at these<br>materials<br>because they are just absolutely<br>fascinating<br>it's necessary and the range of not<br>about nanoparticles here 10 to 100<br>nanometers and these dots which you see<br>on the surface of in this picture here<br>are actually our skin and they order<br>nicely so they are not sitting randomly<br>on the surface no they order perfectly<br>well and form this hexagonal lattice<br>here<br>that picture that was taken on an<br>electron microscope and the samples<br>that have been prepared by<br>where's Louise<br>there he is he made them<br>went all the way to America and I'll<br>uh again very fascinating made out of<br>spins from the metal sitting end and<br>he's we have all sorts of different<br>spins and again why they're interesting<br>because you have spins and you have<br>scorions and you have anti-scombians and<br>again M you have one and you have the<br>empty version of it<br>okay that's information you can store<br>information with that<br>right<br>so people cannot if that exists and if<br>you can write them really fast if you<br>can create them very fast if you can<br>erase them very fast that's probably one<br>I'm not commenting on that I leave this<br>to there<br>to the physicist<br>and even theoretically these beasts are<br>that's an artist's impression how it<br>looks like I really like that it's run<br>thingies here<br>these other scamions in there the spin<br>off the error<br>metal sitting underneath not forming the<br>scones<br>and even more important you can actually<br>move these things around you can apply<br>oh one thing I forgot to say<br>again stop talking about storing<br>information these experiments only exist<br>if you apply a magnetic field if you<br>switch off the field they are gone if<br>you switch the field back on they are<br>there again<br>there's a one one zero thing and<br>hopefully you can use this to store<br>information eventually<br>and even better you can push them around<br>if you apply an electrical field they<br>move<br>so all the things we effectively need<br>to structure something they are there<br>that is so hard to understand<br>that's all how to make<br>so how to make Facebook my tears and<br>vegetarianism even more<br>is the fact that this particular<br>compound here which we look at is the<br>one and only oxide compound you can make<br>as a bug material so far we show the<br>formation of scarlet it is not a second<br>one<br>so the question is why<br>why is that it must be a reason for that<br>act as as a chemist I just can't believe<br>that I just found there must be more<br>than one it can't be the only one there<br>are some intermetallic faces which show<br>that you can do this unseen films for<br>some other compounds but that is the one<br>and only bike material we have<br>and again why<br>I mentioned structural property or<br>um<br>so here's the idea of writing and<br>deleting them so the best that idea has<br>been floating around for a while<br>and again Louise are sitting to Arizona<br>it's not here and that came as a<br>collaboration with Clement civilization<br>just over a discussion over a cup of<br>coffee at the conference<br>so much about not going to conferences<br>anymore<br>that was just we were sitting in the<br>same room having a chat drinking coffee<br>and we came up with saying why don't we<br>do that and start making these things<br>rather than saying films<br>that's how it started<br>now it's funded by the Royal Society<br>with the both of us so it just got<br>really big anyhow<br>that's how we make them you see a<br>beautiful Christmas that is an amazingly<br>and if you take a whole lot of stuff<br>away and just leave the the copper atoms<br>and then oh hang on we know that picture<br>from somewhere yeah this is the same<br>stuff I just showed just 10 slides back<br>and what we keep learning at the moment<br>that this subtraction in our compound<br>seems to be absolutely critical for the<br>formation for scammials<br>because of distorts<br>and that there's thoughts in the way<br>which we have not really predicted<br>thanks for credit to our colleagues in<br>the US at Brookhaven and I'm nearly done<br>that is a picture taken from the electro<br>microscope with the skirmions on the<br>surface<br>and it has something which is called the<br>laminar phase which can create without<br>having a magnetic field present<br>and if you tune to the tune through the<br>magnetic field and temperature we can<br>erase that create the skirmions get rid<br>of them again create them again<br>Etc<br>absolutely fascinating<br>and they move<br>and sometimes they move without being<br>and see that just nicely wander along<br>the surface built here end up on the<br>other side<br>so we have the whole thing we have the<br>whole recipe we just don't know yet how<br>to apply it I'm gonna have to use the<br>right material make the films as thin as<br>almost done<br>so to study that we use a different<br>instrument again at anster in Sydney<br>that is that big monster here that is 40<br>meters long<br>and it's effectively just empty<br>there's nothing in there except the<br>detector which you can move back and<br>forth that's all what's in there<br>that we can use this to study these<br>nanoparticle size materials<br>and thanks to Rosanna for putting that<br>together it might not look that exciting<br>for other people for us it is because<br>these Peaks popping out<br>tell us oh scamions are there<br>so they are formed because they produce<br>a certain pattern and if these Peaks are<br>and I think it's called quokka it's yeah<br>that's a quarter<br>very cute<br>here we go and that is the storage and I<br>was talking about I mean and it looked a<br>little bit messy but that is something<br>we did not expect<br>so if you go down in temperature that is<br>not what you want or what you normally<br>would expect because you would expect<br>that atoms get closer<br>yeah some actually do and some of them<br>don't they do the opposite even though<br>you go down in temperature<br>so you just thought the whole internal<br>structure<br>and the point where the skirmins kick in<br>is effectively at the point of the<br>maximum Distortion here so it must have<br>something to do with it and that's<br>pretty much at the point where we are<br>right now<br>and then we'll stand in collaboration<br>with Czech Professor quite at the<br>University of cleansland because that is<br>the one and only x-ray to fraction<br>instrument which can be cooled down to<br>helium temperature at least in Australia<br>ah here we go<br>as a summary I don't want to give you a<br>summary I think you realize<br>we can do things we can make things we<br>can analyze them what is the big kids we<br>have and it is actually a lot of fun to<br>do this going there doing the<br>measurements getting the data out<br>and trying to understand what we<br>actually have in our hands<br>sir<br>I need to acknowledge<br>the first<br>is my students<br>and rather than giving you a list of<br>names which you<br>forget the second you see them<br>so without their help nothing of that<br>would have happened of course it did all<br>and it's just an absolute pleasure and<br>fun to have them around<br>and supervised so thanks everyone for<br>contributing to that over many many<br>years as I said nothing of that would<br>in these pictures change<br>that's the last one<br>and we have another<br>we have a new addition to the group<br>a whole lot of people have been involved<br>um can't really go through them so I<br>just want to mention a few Chris and<br>Siggy and in Sydney which have been<br>working well for<br>closer to decades now<br>and they're heavily involved in the<br>first project I showed you Clements last<br>project<br>Glenn Glenn Stewart doing a lot of<br>syncrative and a lot of synchronous a<br>lot of most of our stuff for us and so<br>on and so beam line scientists there's a<br>lot of people missing here but<br>especially shout out to Max<br>the most amazing being lion scientists<br>in the whole world<br>seriously<br>a lot of other people the beamline side<br>and said he had answered a different<br>beam lines or signature now which<br>belongs to insterno as well the<br>different beam lines Jason<br>Jason price as you know have known<br>personally for well<br>20 years by now<br>uh Java which is very interesting person<br>my old colleagues my old boss boss<br>when I was a student teaching me a<br>um current and former colleagues Max<br>Planck Institute<br>Richard ponzkowski which hosted me in<br>for me<br>some of you actually know him before he<br>left Auckland he was really instrumental<br>for getting me set up here in Auckland<br>helped me out a lot<br>and interestingly now he's in Castro<br>which happened to happen the birthplace<br>of my life<br>and Dominic in Canada for doing<br>something else<br>as well of course thanks to all of the<br>colleagues in our<br>Department school for helping me out<br>with whatever it was either for the<br>service or else I did or for whatever<br>did academically<br>a lot of crystallography for some<br>colleagues which I enjoy doing<br>enormously<br>in the spare time I don't have but it<br>doesn't matter<br>it is just a lot of fun<br>thanks to some of your colleagues<br>actually in chemical materials<br>engineering if you started working with<br>in the last few years<br>and the colleagues in the faculty<br>which I've been working with in the last<br>two and a half years as part of my 80<br>Euro<br>a yes that was probably the most<br>terrible time to take up this job<br>if I had a over that<br>okay A little bit of thanks to people<br>who thought it was worth while investing<br>and what I'm doing<br>especially I have to add a few special<br>shout outs here<br>that is my PhD supervisor<br>and probably one of the<br>nicest person<br>walking around on the surface of our<br>planet<br>that is beyond imagination he taught me<br>so much<br>how to deal with people how to do things<br>how to he accepted me as the person I am<br>um which is sometimes a little bit hard<br>but it's okay<br>um little stories like that we used to<br>have at nine o'clock<br>coffee thingy every morning<br>I don't think I ever made it to a single<br>one in time<br>but when I finally arrived<br>I'm still my cup on the table waiting me<br>again<br>I can't thank him enough for what he has<br>done<br>the other person of course<br>or the other two<br>of hidden Enrique<br>or Peter more like a trap figure Peter<br>hosting me as a poster piano Auckland<br>sure you told me quantum mechanics<br>that's fine<br>but it really turned into an someone<br>giving me advice all the time<br>told me how I should do things and I<br>shouldn't do things so he really turned<br>into a mentor of mine and a very very<br>good friend<br>I know he could always being there for<br>us for our family<br>doing things when it's needed to be done<br>because we had no family here and we<br>could always jumped in<br>so we are so grateful to have them<br>around<br>okay<br>I can't<br>I can't do anything without you guys<br>it's just absolutely impossible<br>that you deal with when I'm grumpy<br>overworked<br>don't want to talk to anyone you're<br>still there<br>and of course I have to thank my my<br>parents without them same story I could<br>not have done what I have done coming<br>out of the ordinary working class family<br>being the first one going to University<br>and they still were pushing me they're<br>like do this it's important go do it and<br>again I can't thank them enough for all<br>of it<br>here we go I told you oh boy at the time<br>thanks a lot</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
