carrying out research with children, this webinar will explore the contemporary issues, theoretical foundations, and ethical dilemmas of tourism research involving children.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>here and welcome everyone to this<br>webinar on Research involving children<br>my name is Eliza Raymond and I will be<br>your chair for today and I'm really<br>looking forward to this webinar I'm<br>currently doing my PhD in tourism<br>management at Victoria University of<br>Wellington and using a child-centered<br>research approach and I'm also the<br>co-founder of good travel which is a<br>social Enterprise that really advocates<br>for greater awareness and action around<br>Child Protection particularly within<br>tourism destinations<br>so let me share my screen with you and<br>tell you a little bit about what to<br>expect for today<br>so the purpose of today's session is to<br>explore contemporary issues theoretical<br>foundations and ethical considerations<br>of research involving children<br>and to give you a little bit of context<br>about what we'll be talking about some<br>of you might be aware that the unwto<br>recently hosted the global youth tourism<br>Summit which was a really exciting event<br>highlighting the importance of enhancing<br>the engagement of children in the<br>tourism sector<br>and at the same time tourism Scholars<br>like some of the ones we're going to be<br>hearing from today are increasingly<br>recognizing the current scarcity of<br>Tourism research with children and<br>really highlighting the urgency of<br>advancing a child-centered research<br>agenda within tourism<br>so<br>it's a very timely topic I think and a<br>very important one we have three<br>fantastic presentations coming up from<br>from four presenters before I introduce<br>our first Speaker I just want to draw<br>your attention to the Q a chat box so<br>please post your questions in there at<br>any time and we'll discuss them at the<br>end of the three presentations<br>you'll also see an upvote function in<br>the Q a chat so you're welcome to use<br>that so we can kind of see which are the<br>most popular or or important questions<br>to address at the end of the webinar<br>so our first Speaker today is haika<br>shensel heike is an associate professor<br>at and the academic lead of the PHD<br>program in the school of hospitality and<br>tourism at Auckland University of<br>Technology<br>she's published widely on families<br>children and gender issues in tourism<br>and today she'll be presenting on<br>developments in academic tourism<br>research with children and future<br>considerations<br>great thank you Eliza thank you for the<br>introduction and thank you Ian uh for<br>organizing the webinar yeah so my name<br>is hika shinsel<br>um in yeah I will take you through some<br>of the developments and a few<br>considerations but Eliza next slide<br>please<br>uh so I want to talk about tourism<br>research with children publication<br>developments and also some future<br>considerations uh then I will talk a<br>little bit about career prospects of<br>research English children<br>and then I will delve into ethics<br>application constraints which is<br>hampering some of the<br>progression really in um research with<br>children next slide please<br>so this is very very of course schematic<br>but I have looked through some of the<br>literature and tried to find a bit of a<br>pattern and it's really interesting to<br>see that in the 1990s cutting forward a<br>very inferential article<br>um actually included children as active<br>agents uh and then in the 2000s and this<br>is really when I became<br>um active in the field this is when I<br>did my PhD at Victoria University a lot<br>of research really was westernized<br>middle class nuclear families including<br>my research but initially it was quite a<br>bit from a female perspective mothers as<br>Gatekeepers of the families and so my<br>PhD really tried to actually include<br>Fathers as well as children so there was<br>more inclusion of children happening in<br>this decade but also research on social<br>tourism so that's uh part of that and<br>then that 2010s this is really the<br>decade where research out of Asia our<br>family research we're talking about here<br>especially Chinese families but also<br>Singapore and Malaysian families as well<br>and also multi-generational more<br>research on Grandparents were included<br>so increasing inclusion of children and<br>also grows of Publications and family<br>research with children<br>and then really in this decade it's<br>become a lot more Diversified we've seen<br>a lot more research specific family<br>adventure tourism uh more specific to<br>destination but also more focus on<br>well-being and benefits another thing<br>that's really been happening in the last<br>few years is more review articles<br>highlighting the significant gaps so<br>also increasingly children are being<br>included as active agents and there has<br>been a real growth in Publications<br>there's still a lot of gaps and that<br>really leads me to you know going<br>forward academic research needing more<br>diversification in scope<br>now someone in Turkey salabi actually<br>did quite a bit of um and that's part of<br>that review reviewing and<br>um looking at web of science<br>Publications and child research and<br>tourism so this is not just family<br>research from 1995 to 2022 so she out of<br>152 studies 73 were qualitative I think<br>that's what we're probably expecting<br>anyway but tellingly only 33 collected<br>data missed children and so what we can<br>actually see they're really two main<br>clusters and one is where children as<br>tourists be it part of the family or<br>children themselves so we've got young<br>children less or children family<br>vacation and holidays but also part of<br>something more specific like Museum and<br>then of course the other cluster is<br>child sex tourism in volunteer tourism<br>in a bit of social tourism as well but<br>next slide that really leads me to a lot<br>of gaps because there is very little<br>research yet really on children as in<br>house destinations which is of course<br>what Antonia did and I'm sure she will<br>talk about that one and also other<br>issues as well so even so we've seen<br>quite a bit of prose a lot more depths<br>in scope is needed in research with<br>children and I sort of mentioned that in<br>the last few years there's been more<br>focus on well-being and benefits but<br>there really needs to be more focused on<br>problematic issues like for example<br>Family Violence or child custody issues<br>in New Zealand we're actually<br>experiencing quite an epidemic of Family<br>Violence I mean this is not going away<br>when you go on holiday and I know that<br>Eliza sinful is actually doing more<br>research in this in this area another<br>one is really child labor issues as well<br>Indian as I sort of mentioned are what's<br>really needed as well as the inclusion<br>of research on host children uh for<br>example this destination management but<br>also as part of a family business or<br>family entrepreneurship<br>um so I have a student in China in<br>Highland Ireland Who currently is<br>actually doing research on that and we<br>did a review article this Antonia where<br>we identified actually I think it was<br>only two articles who included some<br>voices of children so they're still<br>really really big gaps and really what<br>we need to learn from that is that<br>anything concerning you know children as<br>the future consumer host and produce of<br>Tourism we need to include these voices<br>because this is vital to achieve<br>sustainability there are the next future<br>generation for whatever is happening and<br>now I've put this in career prospects<br>because<br>um<br>my career is very much built on family<br>research and I've got comments in the<br>past that I probably have to diversify<br>more I have to sort of look at you know<br>other aspects you can't really become a<br>professor that way so there are still<br>perceptions of you know including<br>children and research might not be<br>serious enough research the other thing<br>I really like to comment on is the<br>feminization and as you can see here<br>um uh the moderator as well as all the<br>presenters are women and while this is<br>actually a really really good thing and<br>I know fryer actually commented on that<br>I would actually consider it a little<br>bit problematic and we have commented on<br>this before in an editorial it was near<br>car uh where you know why is it that<br>it's mainly women who actually are in<br>this field and are actually conducting<br>research with children ideally I would<br>like to see more maturity I would like<br>to see more professors male professors<br>who also are in the field which really<br>gets me to my second point the transient<br>nature of the field so there are quite a<br>few who write some really significant<br>articles or books like for example near<br>car this very influential book on<br>children and families on family holidays<br>but he's not longer really active in the<br>field I know he's supervising PhD<br>students so there's quite a few who<br>actually come in write a few articles or<br>a book and actually no longer active in<br>the field<br>and I think it's complex and we can<br>maybe debate that at the end so I<br>haven't really quite got the time to get<br>into that one thing is you know maybe<br>because it's time consuming it's special<br>expertise that's needed and then also<br>the Essex application and that really I<br>will get to that after this as well<br>um you know other thing is maybe it's<br>easier for women<br>um I've I've seen you know some male<br>doing research as well who find it<br>actually a bit harder to actually then<br>sit down with women and doing research<br>so I think it's something to be mindful<br>of and as I say we can probably debate<br>this a little bit later on as well the<br>other one is really the lack of<br>Attraction and that has been you know<br>raised previously so I've put down this<br>reference of Jenny small which was or<br>still is a very influential article the<br>absence of childhood and tourism studies<br>and animals of Tourism research I'm sure<br>we all have referenced it before very<br>influential was very important for my P<br>PhD it has garnered 185 citations so you<br>know this is 15 years ago very<br>influential article in adults that<br>should be in the thousands probably but<br>yeah it's not that kind of field so<br>getting traction and in terms of career<br>prospects um doing research with<br>children probably it doesn't fast track<br>your career to become a professor<br>they're sort of other topics as such you<br>know<br>so that gets me to my last slide um the<br>ethical considerations<br>um one is I think sometimes almost an<br>active discouragement to include<br>children so for our doctoral board<br>whenever you have to fill out the full<br>proposal it asks you are children<br>included in this research and if you<br>ticket you actually need to have police<br>clearance and it's quite often you get<br>comments oh you know can you really do<br>this this is really difficult so it has<br>almost like an active disencouragement<br>and to me and I'm sure Antonio will talk<br>more about that she addresses some of<br>these issues later on so I just want to<br>raise it from my experience and from my<br>masters and PhD students<br>um the what we are experiencing then we<br>actually not asking if you do research<br>does this have an impact on children and<br>if you take yes the next question goes<br>um are you including children's voices<br>and you can take nor no you actually<br>then have to justify why not but we<br>don't do that do we so one is actually<br>the time consuming ethics application<br>process I have quite a few PhD students<br>and a master's students and particularly<br>for the master student you know when<br>you've only got one year it is timely it<br>took a long time you can get it through<br>all my research students to include<br>children's voices as part of the family<br>and I spoke to you know the senior at<br>the Ethics Committee and she was very<br>supportive but you do have to submit all<br>these extra information extra<br>information sheets for young children<br>for teenagers for adults so it<br>definitely takes time in that of course<br>my next point that potentially can lead<br>to costly delays and research and again<br>we're all time constrained<br>um you know can we actually afford it<br>yes it's really important but yeah it's<br>it's part of these issues and that<br>really leads me to my next point is<br>almost like rounding it out because<br>initially I said we do actually need<br>more research into more problematic<br>areas but it's also particularly hard to<br>get Essex clearance at least in New<br>Zealand nothing in Australia is to say<br>for more sensitive topics sort of more<br>sensitive topics which I actually needed<br>are also harder to actually get ethics<br>clearance and get through the Ethics<br>Committee and I think that just about<br>leaves me according to my stopwatch so<br>thank you very much and I hand over to<br>Antonia thank you thank you so much hika<br>that was a fantastic introduction to<br>some of the opportunities and and<br>challenges I think that we're face<br>working in this area so I'll now hand<br>over to Dr Antonio canossa Antonia is an<br>anthropologist and research fellow with<br>the Center for Children and young people<br>at Southern Cross University in<br>Australia her work focuses on children's<br>rights participation and well-being in<br>the context of Tourism and today she'll<br>be presenting on how to move Beyond<br>research on children to research with<br>children so over to you Antonia<br>thanks very much Eliza and lovely to be<br>with you today just before I start I<br>thought I'd um acknowledge and pay<br>respect to the Iraq people of the<br>bangalang Nation on Whose land I work in<br>living I'm working from home today I<br>live in the beautiful Byron Bay Area in<br>Australia and I pay my respects to<br>Elders past present and emerging<br>um yeah so lovely to be with you<br>um thanks for the introduction Eliza I'm<br>really passionate about doing research<br>with children so I work in the areas of<br>children's rights well-being<br>participation and I do that across two<br>different disciplines so tourism studies<br>and childhood studies so most of our<br>projects within the Center for Children<br>and young people are organ up conceived<br>in collaboration with young people so<br>most of our work is participatory so I<br>thought I'd present to you today on how<br>to move Beyond research on children to a<br>more participatory approach and actually<br>research with children<br>so to do that I think we need<br>um and hikers highlighted really well<br>the gaps that are currently<br>um you know the future future<br>researchers need to feel<br>um so in our next slide Eliza thank you<br>I wanted to introduce you to this<br>concept of childism I think to move<br>forward in this area of research we<br>really need a solid theoretical<br>foundation and childism is a is a really<br>good critical lens employed to<br>understand children's marginalized<br>experiences so we've said that children<br>have been marginalized in research but<br>not just in research historically also<br>in society and in communities<br>so um childism is like feminism but for<br>children uh so some like some of those<br>critical lenses like postcolonialism<br>feminism anti-racism<br>um childism really provides a great<br>epistemological and ontological<br>Foundation to deconstruct some of that<br>Adultism that's um permeated society and<br>tourism studies as well and reconstruct<br>more age-inclusive research and advocacy<br>and so for this to happen we really need<br>to shift<br>um how we think about children they're<br>not just vulnerable they're not just<br>immature and in the process of<br>developing into adults they're actually<br>rights holders and social agents as um<br>hiker pointed out<br>so in the next slide<br>um I just wanted to introduce you to<br>some of the key principles of this<br>theoretical lens<br>so children are human beings not just<br>human becomings they're not just adults<br>in the making they're actually children<br>right now and they have you know<br>important perspectives and lived<br>experiences to contribute to our<br>research and for us researchers I think<br>um<br>their vulnerability should never prevent<br>us from including them in our research<br>and hearing directly from them when we<br>can<br>um also this notion that children have<br>human rights equal to adults so I'll<br>talk to you in a minute about the United<br>Nation convention on the rights of the<br>child<br>um as hiker said children are social<br>agents and they're able to make a<br>contributed contribution not just to<br>research but also to for example tourism<br>planning tourism policy<br>and this notion that childhood is<br>socially constructed and culturally<br>situated so meaning that children are a<br>social category<br>um that has been historically<br>marginalized and if we want to use uh<br>you know paoloth Vader's terms that have<br>been oppressed historically<br>so why is this important for tourism<br>in the next slide thanks Eliza<br>um I think childism provides a really<br>solid basis to solve some of the big<br>social justice issues in tourism so<br>we're talking about things like<br>orphanage tourism<br>um or you know how can children be<br>involved in sustainable tourism planning<br>in the communities where they grow up<br>moms or host children how can children<br>become responsible tourists and then you<br>know influence their family when they go<br>traveling<br>but you know if we want to do research<br>with children<br>um it's our ethical obligation I think<br>um to to really pay attention to their<br>rights and how to uphold their rights<br>during the research process so um you<br>know ethics isn't just a ticker box that<br>we fill out the form and then we figured<br>about<br>ethics when we go into the field but<br>it's actually really a process that we<br>need to keep on thinking about am I<br>upholding their rights during the the<br>field work<br>so in the next slide I just wanted to<br>briefly introduce you to the United<br>Nation convention on the rights of the<br>child or uncrc it's one of the most<br>widely ratified human rights treaties in<br>history was ratified in 1989 and it it's<br>really helped transform children's lives<br>around the world and for us researchers<br>I think article 12 is uh really<br>important voiced in all matters that<br>affect them so there's 54 articles and<br>they're usually grouped into three uh<br>they call the three p's provision<br>protection and participation so when<br>we're researching with children we<br>really need to think about their<br>participation rights so their<br>vulnerability should never Eclipse their<br>agency so how do we uphold children's<br>rights to have a voice and have a say in<br>how they participate in our research I<br>think that's really important we need to<br>really plan our research in<br>collaboration we with them so that they<br>have a voice and that can make decisions<br>about how they want to participate in<br>our research<br>so to get started in the next slide in<br>my own research I found that the Eric<br>website is really helpful it Eric stands<br>for ethical research involving children<br>it's a partnership between UNICEF and<br>the center where I work and it's a<br>really good starting point for um you<br>know all those methodological and<br>ethical nitty-gritty questions that you<br>might be grappling with in your own<br>research as I mentioned you know<br>research ethics isn't just a ticker box<br>you fill out the form you get approval<br>and then you know you forget about it<br>but<br>when you're in the field we're field<br>when you're doing your field work when<br>you're collecting data with children you<br>have to go through all those ethical<br>decision-making processes that happen in<br>situ and so um you know remaining<br>reflexive and attuned to the needs of<br>your young participants takes you know a<br>bit of<br>um reflexivity we call it and so this<br>website has<br>um some great information that can help<br>you plan your research and help you<br>during your research and then you know<br>the dissemination phase which is also<br>really important and that we hardly ever<br>talk about but you know how to<br>disseminine disseminate findings that<br>um uh created in collaboration with your<br>young participants<br>so I think the main thing I've learned<br>in my journey researching with children<br>is to plan your research in partnership<br>with them<br>so in the next slide I just thought I'd<br>leave you<br>um with a few tips so I've been involved<br>in eight big research projects and<br>they're not all in tourism so we do<br>research in schools and in communities<br>we've done a couple of big research<br>projects with children with disability<br>and children living in residential care<br>services here in Australia so before you<br>start your research project really plan<br>and consult with the children and young<br>people or ideally your research<br>participants so we talk about children<br>as this homogenized group but really if<br>you're researching with children in New<br>Zealand it might be very different from<br>researching with children in Australia<br>so if you are able to and I know this is<br>um sometimes time consuming but consult<br>with a group of your young participants<br>and ask them how how they would like to<br>be involved in the research project and<br>this might require you know multiple<br>changes of protocol with your Ethics<br>Committee but it's really worth it<br>because you you<br>um you are collecting more meaningful<br>data and you are upholding their right<br>to have a voice in your research and we<br>call this um child-led research or<br>co-researching with children<br>um so you can see in that image on the<br>left hand side there's children playing<br>with little plasticine figures and that<br>was doing my PhD they actually created<br>um some some short films or animations<br>with the<br>um Clay figurines<br>um and they were exploring their<br>experiences of growing up in a tourist<br>destination through that Medium<br>so the next which brings me to the next<br>point is employ creative methods ask<br>your participants how they would like to<br>be involved if they would like to be<br>involved with um you know in interviews<br>using drawing or you know plasticine<br>film theater whatever engages them and<br>makes them um you know want to<br>participate in your research because you<br>know sometimes it can be a bit boring<br>being in a research interview and having<br>an adult someone that you don't know um<br>you know asking you all these questions<br>so creative methods is a really good way<br>to engage young people and um on the on<br>on the right hand side there's an image<br>of the young people in our<br>um the latest research project where<br>they actually created a theater<br>performance um based on the findings of<br>our research so they they<br>um co-researched and collected peer<br>interviews in the community then they<br>created the play and then they performed<br>that play in the community which was a<br>great educational experience for them<br>the last point is um and I think hiker<br>mentioned this before have really open<br>conversations with your University<br>ethics board because at the end of the<br>day<br>um you want to be able to<br>um you know have that that relationship<br>with them and challenge some of their<br>decisions sometimes and back back up<br>your your your argument with uh you know<br>solid scholarship saying you know I want<br>to put my my participants at the center<br>of this project I want to make my<br>project more participatory this is the<br>scholarship that um that I'm drawing on<br>and it's really valid and this is how I<br>can do it so I have those open<br>conversations because<br>um it's really worth it uh you know when<br>you when you get those setbacks<br>um you want to be able to push forward<br>and make a statement there<br>so I think I've I've gone a bit over<br>time but um yeah really passionate I'll<br>um I'm just leaving you with a few<br>references<br>um of my own work<br>um if if you can't access some of those<br>articles please um get in touch I would<br>love to talk more and happy to take<br>questions at the end thank you thank you<br>so much Antonia that was so so<br>interesting and great to have some of<br>those practical tips there at the end<br>and for anyone else perhaps new to this<br>area or interested in doing more<br>research I really recommend the website<br>Antonio was discussing their ethical<br>research involving children website it<br>has been such a great resource for my<br>PhD and there's just so much great<br>information in there<br>so just before we turn to our final<br>presentation I just want to remind<br>everyone to please post your questions<br>in the Q a chat box and we'll be coming<br>to them at the end but feel free to post<br>them in there at any time and upvote the<br>questions that you're you're keen on<br>hearing the answers to so for our final<br>presentation I'll now hand over to Dr<br>Julia Albrecht and Fatima chirani who<br>are from the University of otago and<br>they will be speaking about their<br>research work piloting child-centered<br>and child-led methodologies to involve<br>and Inspire responsible visitors of<br>tomorrow so over to you Julia yeah thank<br>you very much Eliza and also to Ian for<br>organizing the session<br>so the research that we're presenting is<br>a collaboration not only of myself and<br>shirani let's also not forget Eliza who<br>isn't participating because she's<br>sharing the session today<br>so unlike the other presenters I<br>personally don't have a long history of<br>research with children I came here<br>through long-standing interests in<br>sustainability destination management<br>and behavior change for sustainable<br>travel and at some point you can't<br>ignore the fact that children are<br>obviously a very important part of this<br>so this is a pilot project that we did<br>that was very much exploratory nature<br>and we were interested in looking at<br>methodology specifically to consider<br>issues around sustainability in<br>destinations with children<br>could we get the next slide please<br>thank you so uh underlying motivation<br>and assumption for this work is that if<br>children grow up with an awareness of<br>responsible travel with host Community<br>concerns and essentially got visitor<br>Behavior then they would be more likely<br>to leave a positive impact on the places<br>that they visit and may ultimately<br>transform travel one trip or perhaps one<br>generation at a time but having said<br>that we don't only have this under<br>representation of children and tourism<br>research we also have this<br>underrepresentation in tourism<br>Destination Planning and management and<br>also in the research underlying those<br>processes<br>so clearly create her presence<br>involvement or even leadership of<br>children in this type of research is<br>bound to be conducive to sustainable or<br>more responsible tourism more broadly<br>and I would also like to put forward the<br>fact that it's in many ways an ethical<br>obligation to involve children in these<br>processes because they are important<br>stakeholders in all things tourism not<br>only as Travelers but also as host<br>Community residents so the idea of<br>childism that Antonio has talked about<br>before is very relevant in the context<br>of Destination Planning and management<br>as well<br>also we know through studies not only in<br>tourism but outside square that younger<br>Generations have been shown to have a<br>comparatively High awareness of<br>environmental concerns and social<br>concerns um generally so as such we do<br>know that they can be important<br>advocates for sustainability<br>and in this project we have tried<br>different ways in which to discuss<br>matters of sustainability and tourism<br>with children but we also wanted to<br>include children in the decision making<br>as to what these issues were that are<br>important in this discussion in the<br>first place<br>and I now head over to shirani to<br>explain the methods and methodologies<br>that we tried in more detail<br>thank you Julia um Eliza can I please<br>the next slide thank you so as many of<br>you mentioned um Antonia High key and<br>even Julia mentioned about children<br>being stakeholders and how important it<br>is to respect their voice as well as<br>um knowing their agency when we do the<br>research so we took this uh voice uh the<br>agency and being stakeholders here and<br>as stakeholders these Concepts very<br>seriously when we did our research and<br>um so and our Focus was on children who<br>were within the residing in the<br>destination and to reach these children<br>we as as a pilot project we took two<br>settings and we decided on reaching<br>children through a school setting and<br>also through a family setting so we<br>started with the school which is just a<br>one single School in Dunedin which is<br>McHenry based School in Dunedin so we<br>approached the school and thankfully won<br>year six uh classroom which is<br>um<br>constituting of children within the age<br>range of 10 to 11 years they volunteered<br>to participate in our project and so we<br>are very grateful and thankful for their<br>participation in the project and at the<br>same time the school helped us to reach<br>other potential families and<br>um we had six families with children<br>within the age range of 2 to 10 years<br>who expressed an interest to participate<br>and their<br>and from most of these families are<br>except for two families we had the<br>family interviews done in their family<br>homes but I think one thing which we<br>really observed from the both in the<br>school setting as as in the family<br>setting is most of the children that we<br>did who got involved in our study they<br>were really privileged most of them have<br>traveled extensively and they were and<br>there were many good experienced<br>Travelers among them so that's some<br>something we really upset can we move<br>into the next slide on this side<br>thank you<br>so um so<br>recognizing the fact that children are<br>diverse and it's becoming more common as<br>we learn uh when we're researching with<br>children we did trial a number of<br>methods when we worked with the children<br>and not only we just work with the<br>children we also try to work uh help and<br>get codied and do a bit of<br>research by cheer and so if you can see<br>the uh it does let call it Charlotte so<br>we kind of moved on from an adult-led<br>process to a more a child-led process in<br>our research now since considering the<br>time Factor I'm not going to talk much<br>about the family interviews the whole<br>family interviews we did but we started<br>at the school with a very teacher<br>oriented a teacher facilitated Focus<br>Group which is much more a traditional<br>type I would say but with children it's<br>still real it's still very uncommon but<br>then also we did a Lego serious play<br>Workshop with children expressing their<br>abuse using different Lego models so<br>these two sessions the teacher-led focus<br>group and researcher LED leg was<br>seriously it was really helpful for us<br>because it kind of gave us insights on<br>really important topics and important<br>ideas which children which really<br>mattered to the children so we took<br>these ideas and topics on board and it<br>kind of we kind of fed these ideas into<br>our next sessions which which is the<br>call it and child-led sessions so these<br>topics which was really interest to<br>Children became the point of discussion<br>for the family interviews as well for<br>other college sessions so the college<br>sessions uh where we kind of<br>co-partnered with the children we were<br>there for the children we supported the<br>children but at the same time we try to<br>reduce our interference as much possible<br>so the children can really bring out<br>their voices and carry out the whole<br>process the way they wanted it and for<br>the final one the child LED interviews<br>it was completely driven by the children<br>so we it was adult free but we did<br>knowing that this is a research is a<br>very adult driven process we did guide<br>the children at the start on the process<br>with some guidelines<br>so uh I would say that it is a high time<br>that we move from more adults led to<br>Childhood process as we progress with<br>researching with children now pass on to<br>Julia to talk more about the findings<br>and outcome of the research thank you<br>thank you shirani so we have first<br>analyzed um our findings for each method<br>separately and then we looked at our<br>findings across all the methods that we<br>tried and we came up with these five key<br>themes which cover a variety of the<br>characteristics of the methods that we<br>tried so there was<br>um some focus on the risk type of<br>responses that we've got and how they're<br>related to how the questions were asked<br>and by whom we looked at the extent to<br>which we<br>um and our core researchers and the<br>children achieved engagement with<br>research respondents and so on so we<br>could talk about this for a long time<br>but for the purposes of today we chose<br>three<br>items to focus on and the first is the<br>very clear preference that children<br>appear to have for being interviewed<br>by other children rather than by adults<br>and there was also preference for<br>interactions to be child-led as well so<br>for us as research that has meant that<br>we were defect our observers in a<br>situation and we removed ourselves in<br>terms of our input but also spatially a<br>little bit from the situation so as to<br>not interfere as much while this was<br>very Illuminating to watch I will say<br>that as a researcher some of it felt<br>like a bit of a sacrifice on our part<br>because when there were interesting<br>points that we or I would have loved to<br>follow up on I found it hard at times<br>not to ask a question<br>so there is this which really requires a<br>rethinking of how we engage with our<br>research participants and that was a<br>very steep learning curve I thought we<br>also have a bit of a conundrum going on<br>because they did see that where there<br>were good questions that you with<br>situational questions or storytelling<br>techniques we did see that<br>um the responses were more detailed so<br>it's a bit of a catch-22 and One Way<br>Forward could be to involve children of<br>different ages and these types of<br>confess conversations where perhaps the<br>older children that have a bit more<br>experience in Social settings maybe<br>working with younger or other children<br>we were very impressed with the extent<br>to which children kept on task through<br>the entire conversation could we get the<br>thank you<br>so um typically in conversations about<br>sustainability with research<br>participants I have found that<br>destination planners and managers and I<br>like to deviate and talk about other<br>things children not so much they stayed<br>on topic the entire time and that was<br>regardless of whether or not<br>um there was adult involvement in the<br>interview or not we found the Lego<br>series play an excellent technique to<br>invoice everyone in the conversation and<br>not only the more vocal children that<br>was a very useful thing to be doing<br>and we also found that um the different<br>methods that we tried resulted in very<br>articulate responses with regard to what<br>constitutes sustainability in the<br>destination but also sustainability when<br>children are traveling themselves so all<br>right we found this pilot incredibly<br>Illuminating and we found that not only<br>is it obviously worse and ethically the<br>right thing to do to engage children in<br>these kinds of conversations we were<br>also very impressed with the insight and<br>Nuance of responses that we have found<br>and we look forward to more to come<br>thank you so much<br>Julia and sharani that was the perfect<br>way to kind of round up the series of<br>presentations and really putting some of<br>those tips from Antonia into practice<br>with with real practical examples of of<br>what that looked like in in your<br>research and our research so we now have<br>some time for questions thank you so<br>much for all sticking to your time<br>limits<br>um so I will open it up to questions I<br>can see some starting to pop up so the<br>first one here is from Victoria golden<br>Fussell and she's saying a small<br>question as a research ethics advisor I<br>often encourage people to thank their<br>participants by giving koha or a token<br>of appreciation sometimes applicants<br>want to give children small toys or<br>chocolate which can be problematic in<br>some contexts I would be interested to<br>know if you have any specific views on<br>the appropriateness of gifts for child<br>participants<br>so I'll give that one to Antonia to kick<br>us off because I know Antonio has a lot<br>of experience with this<br>uh thanks um yeah so I think um I mean I<br>think um children and young people<br>should be compensated for the time they<br>put in<br>um and you know they're giving us their<br>lived experiences so we we in our<br>research project we generally include<br>that in our ethics applications<br>um and we generally give<br>um our participants like a voucher for<br>something so it's like like in schools<br>it can be a can canteen voucher<br>um in projects in the community<br>um you know like a gift voucher from a<br>store but it's generally not like it's<br>it's a token so it's a small small<br>amount and we generally don't advertise<br>that when we when we're recruiting<br>participants so<br>um it's more you know asking them to<br>participate in our research and then at<br>the end of it giving the token uh of<br>appreciation so that's what we generally<br>do but it yeah it does bring up<br>um some ethical questions particularly<br>if you're giving out you know things<br>like chocolate or<br>um and it's culturally situated also so<br>depending on where you're doing research<br>I think you really need to think about<br>that<br>you know not sure if I dressed the<br>question<br>yeah thank you Antonia that's that's<br>perfect<br>um Julio or hiker is there anything you<br>wanted to add to that<br>no I just completely agree I mean what<br>we've done in the past as well is yeah<br>little Lego and that's particularly you<br>know truly it was really nice to see um<br>that you used the legal series play so<br>yeah little packets was Legos<br>um but yeah I was recently reading an<br>article then that's part of the issue<br>with Essex and I'm sure and Tony as<br>familiar with that was actually giving<br>koha or yeah tokens for children is<br>actually problematic in a getting ethics<br>applications through but then you know<br>completely um we need to acknowledge the<br>time and the effort that children put in<br>so yeah definitely<br>yeah little toys things like that so<br>yeah<br>thank you thank you another question<br>here from Orly Orbach based in the UK<br>all he works for the Association of<br>Social anthropologists ethical<br>guidelines and informed consent is one<br>of them how does this idea of informed<br>consent consent translate to<br>child-centered research maybe Julio and<br>sharani you could share what what you<br>did in your project<br>uh yes we can and I think it's important<br>um here with the question of informed<br>consent to distinguish between the<br>ethics process and you know doing the<br>thing with the form and having a really<br>good idea of the situation to make sure<br>everyone feels comfortable the right<br>questions are being asked and<br>situational ethics I think with children<br>are incredibly important as well so<br>um I guess speaking as a researcher I<br>think I would be extremely<br>emphasize if not in some cases<br>prioritize the ethics in the situation<br>in the room to make sure that everything<br>works well for everyone however speaking<br>as a member of the Ethics Committee at<br>the University of otago I think we have<br>we cannot neglect the other part of the<br>process ethics either and one thing that<br>we have found<br>um extremely valuable in working with<br>the school is not only to get<br>approval from parents obviously because<br>this is what you need to do but to also<br>get the teachers on board and helping to<br>create an environment in which the<br>research can take place in a comfortable<br>and safe way and I think working with<br>for example teachers or families can be<br>and I think one thing important when we<br>talk about informed consent as well as<br>is the language and also not treating uh<br>so it should be child friendly based on<br>the age group as well that's something<br>to be considerate when we do informed<br>consent and informed consent just<br>doesn't mean a document a written<br>document so it's something which needs<br>to be ongoing when we communicate with<br>the children so it can be done both as a<br>written format and with the an in an<br>oral format so and it can be checked as<br>we go with the children and children can<br>be sometimes very honest and very<br>expressive of what whether they like to<br>go on or whether they want to stop so I<br>think it we have to be very mindful that<br>informed concept is not just a signature<br>or like you know a mark on a consent<br>form but it's something which we need to<br>be observant and it's something which<br>needs to be ongoing Point yeah thank you<br>thank you sharani yeah really good<br>points there and I know for my own PhD<br>research one of my advisors from from<br>orangutamariki really encouraged me to<br>focus on on building the relationship<br>first because it's very difficult to<br>gain truly informed consent If the child<br>you're researching is not not trusting<br>you so thinking about how that process<br>can begin before you're even you know in<br>the same room together so through I<br>created some introductory videos of<br>myself and my family and things like<br>that for my participants to watch before<br>I even met them to kind of have that as<br>an ongoing process so thank you and we<br>have some more questions here and from<br>from Den Mohammed who is a PhD student<br>at Victoria University<br>is asking is there any study on the<br>impact of Tourism on children and their<br>development<br>maybe I should talk to that one I'm<br>doing my PhD on that to some extent um<br>focusing specifically on the impact of<br>Tourism on children who travel and their<br>sense of global citizenship so hopefully<br>I will have results to share on that on<br>that soon and there have been some<br>studies looking at the impact of<br>children who travel in terms of<br>cognitive development and and that kind<br>of thing but predominantly from the<br>perspectives of their parents so I think<br>this really ties in with what hiker was<br>talking about at the start in terms of<br>needing to shift some of that towards<br>really recognizing the value of talking<br>with with children themselves and<br>understanding their perspectives of how<br>how travel has shaped them and then link<br>to that also<br>reflecting back on hiker's points around<br>the importance of increasing the amount<br>of research with children in tourist<br>destinations how does<br>tourism influence children's development<br>in destinations where they're receiving<br>a lot of tourists and interacting with<br>tourists on a daily basis<br>yeah I just wanted to add to that thanks<br>Eliza that um yeah I did my PhD on the<br>impacts of Tourism on children living in<br>host communities so I looked at<br>um not so much the development of<br>children but looking at the impact on<br>their sense of identity and sense of<br>belonging because having all these<br>visitors come in at particular times<br>during the year really plays with that<br>sense of place a sense of belonging<br>um you know that's my beach and there's<br>too many people I can't I can't access<br>that that area of my community so that<br>was really interesting and yeah happy<br>happy for you to get in touch if you'd<br>thank you Antonia<br>um another question here from Zohan Lee<br>who's really interested in the child LED<br>and co-led interview and would like to<br>ask how to choose a child interviewer so<br>are there any standards or how might we<br>consider the relationship between the<br>children so for example do the child<br>interviewer and the interviewer<br>so in the specific setting that we did<br>the research in we worked closely with<br>the teacher as well to get an idea of<br>what children might be comfortable in<br>that kind of role so as to not<br>push I need to run into a situation<br>where they wouldn't want to be the<br>interviewer in terms of being friends<br>um we don't know whether the children<br>were friends or not because we are not<br>that familiar with that with a large<br>group of children but having said that<br>across the board children were willing<br>to support their peers when they knew<br>that one of their schoolmates whether<br>they were friends or not would be in the<br>interview or rowers they would make an<br>effort to respond to their question they<br>weren't left out in the code so even if<br>they weren't friends the fact that they<br>were going to school together meant that<br>they would be willing to collaborate in<br>and um just to add to what Julia said<br>um also you know it depends on the the<br>group that you're researching so for<br>example in my own research I um access<br>the young the children and young people<br>through youth groups in the community<br>um so it's really important that the<br>participants have some common interests<br>with between the interviewer and the<br>interviewee<br>um so yes they know each other but they<br>have interest and so that there's that<br>trust relationship between them I think<br>that's really important<br>um yeah so it depends on on the on the<br>research group that you're wanting to<br>research because every child is<br>different<br>and the setting may have an impact as<br>well I was later reflecting whether a<br>school which is associated with a sort<br>of question and answer style of<br>communication a lot of the time anyway<br>might be particularly conducive to this<br>kind of interview conversation and I<br>don't know whether we would have<br>achieved the same outcome with those<br>very same children let's say in an<br>absolutely thank you another question<br>here from utasanya fanik Von Schumann<br>who's a PhD candidate at northumbria<br>University and would like to know about<br>how we can not just give voice but also<br>give visibility to and of young<br>children's social interactions and<br>practices and then clavic tourism<br>hiker can I put you on the spot for that<br>one<br>yeah thank you I actually thought that<br>Antonio's probably the better person to<br>to answer that one because she did that<br>fantastic work with you know I like that<br>theater idea in all of that so I don't<br>know can I<br>push the ball onto Antonio yeah yeah<br>sure so um yeah I just wanted a little<br>bit more yeah I couldn't understand the<br>question so<br>um<br>yeah not just giving voice obviously but<br>um<br>You by in clavic tourism settings I<br>can can they can<br>participants<br>yeah maybe I don't think so but if UTA<br>you could maybe add a little bit more<br>more context to your question yeah yeah<br>but absolutely it's not just about<br>giving voice it's<br>um you know getting them engaged in the<br>actual research process so<br>um you know working with a group of of<br>children and young people over a period<br>of time so with the bar and youth<br>theater we worked with them for uh for<br>two years so we had that really close<br>relationship where<br>um you know they we trained them as<br>researchers we did a various workshops<br>to talk about ethics talk about informed<br>consent talk about what kind of data and<br>questions they wanted to<br>um ask of their coal um of their peers<br>or participants and just having that<br>really close relationship so I guess it<br>is time consuming like hiker was saying<br>but it's really meaningful when you're<br>working with the same group of<br>participants over a period of time so<br>just yeah it just depends I think it it<br>um maybe in clavic tourism means in a<br>yeah yeah no but that's those are great<br>points Antonio in terms of again that<br>relationship right and building the<br>relationship so that you can<br>really engage with kids and get great<br>information which I think relates to<br>this next question from Carla ricarde<br>who's a researcher in guayaquile Ecuador<br>and became interested on this topic<br>because of her own children which I<br>think is the case for for many of us on<br>the panel today and she says that she<br>wonders what do you do when children<br>give short answers do you use pictures<br>I can speak to that<br>um yeah absolutely I mean you have to be<br>much more creative and that's where you<br>know Julia and sharani was the legal<br>series play and I currently have a PhD<br>student who's doing that as well uh<br>maybe Plato and again Antonio spoke to<br>that I mean I used photo elicitation I<br>actually look it was a while ago but I<br>gave<br>um disposable cameras to children and<br>they really liked that and then I got it<br>developed and you know so you have to<br>give them yes you have to be creative<br>they're talking about or answering<br>questions is very abstract so you really<br>need to use some other creative forms<br>and there's a lot more happening with<br>teenagers uh so I've got a PhD student<br>who's looking at um African immigrants<br>families in New Zealand and he's<br>thinking about having like a digital you<br>know using smartphones using digital<br>Diaries<br>um I tried um<br>a journal that didn't really work so<br>much in a domestic context but yes you<br>have to be very think very creatively<br>and from my experience as well because I<br>interviewed the families again there's<br>children half a year later actually most<br>children couldn't remember much so yeah<br>you did photos<br>well some reminders it was really quite<br>interesting how quickly we forget things<br>and so you need all these prompts and I<br>think Lego is a fantastic way Play-Doh<br>sorry hiki are you still uh no or can I<br>add something into that yeah yeah<br>um I mean I completely agree that we<br>have to use different techniques and<br>again it depends on the children so<br>sometimes we can really customize based<br>on the children but it depends on<br>whether you are doing a one-on-one<br>um or as a group uh so for example in my<br>PhD I've used something called magic<br>boxes which and I've I've turned into a<br>unicorn at one point and um so I was<br>dressed up as a unicorn so it can be<br>anything as long as the child feels<br>comfortable and and what works for the<br>child and again it can depend on<br>different children and their age range<br>so one of my participants who was a 15<br>year old he preferred using photo<br>elicitation and a Blog Page and whereas<br>the one Rita who was a six to seven year<br>old they preferred using photographs<br>um and evens um like you know dancing<br>and singing so it completely depends on<br>children and how they want to express<br>their views<br>thank you yeah really good points<br>um we just have a couple of minutes left<br>so just a final question to wrap up for<br>you all is what what would you like to<br>see moving forward what are your ideas<br>or requests in terms of further research<br>for people who are interested in in<br>doing more research involving children<br>um I'll just jump in there<br>um yeah I'd really like to see more<br>research planned in collaboration with<br>children and young people people so<br>having a say in how how the research is<br>actually conducted like from the very<br>start not just when you're out there in<br>the field collecting the data and also I<br>think we need we need more research in<br>the global South I think there's a real<br>um Gap there for tourism studies in the<br>yeah completely agree<br>um and I think we really we're doing a<br>lot more research on children as as um<br>in many ways consumers or tourists be it<br>within the family or child tourism but I<br>think we really need to shift it a lot<br>more on in many ways what Antonia did as<br>well host children uh host destinations<br>and moving forward because we're going<br>much more into community-led tourism and<br>yeah I think that emphasis really needs<br>to change admittedly I come from you<br>know perspective doing research on<br>children really as as tourists but I'm<br>very aware that yeah that that there<br>needs to be a lot more research<br>um involving children that's why I love<br>Antonio's work uh I can only really<br>um<br>really applaud that but yes in child<br>labor issues<br>um in more creative and yeah and also of<br>course I really like what chirani and<br>Julia<br>um they're kind of again you know we<br>need to see if we want to see<br>more sustainable and regenerative<br>tourism changes in the way<br>um yeah tourism is being managed we<br>really need to include the voices of<br>I think that's the the perfect place to<br>wrap it up thank you hiker and thank you<br>so much to everyone for for joining us<br>for what's been I hope are really<br>interesting and thought-provoking<br>webinar this will be the last seminar of<br>Victoria University of Wellington for<br>2022 so this is the first time I've said<br>this this year but wishing you all a<br>wonderful holiday season ahead and um<br>hoping you all have a have a
