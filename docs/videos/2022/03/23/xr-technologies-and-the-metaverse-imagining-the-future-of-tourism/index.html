imagining<br>the future of tourism<br>this webinar today hosted by group of<br>tourism management school of management<br>victory university of wellington<br>i'd like to welcome all of our audience<br>and participants<br>from new zealand also an international<br>attendee<br>i also acknowledge our three speakers<br>from uk<br>us and new zealand<br>before we move forward<br>i'd like to thank associate professor<br>ian yeoman and luin's grandside for<br>organizing this webinar<br>my name is najib aribi and i'm a phd<br>student in tourism management at<br>victoria university of wellington<br>and<br>it's my pleasure to share this webinar<br>today<br>today's webinar about the future of<br>tourism with the current pandemic and<br>acceleration<br>in technology usage and also introducing<br>the metaphors<br>it seems that we have a future<br>using xr technologies ahead<br>so um<br>today we have asked our quest this<br>question of our three speakers<br>and consider this and imagine it's 2000<br>2013<br>and um<br>so how xr technologies and the methods<br>will shape the future of tourism<br>industry<br>so um they're going to take you on a<br>journey to the future from the<br>perspective of our three experts<br>so today we have three prominent<br>speakers<br>associate professor faison ali<br>from<br>university of south florida<br>professor timothy jung from manchester<br>metropolitan university<br>and dr christopher maymoon from victory<br>university of wellington<br>they're going to explore different<br>every speaker has 10 minutes to speak<br>and we also have the question and answer<br>function open on the webinar<br>so this means that you can ask any<br>question<br>during the webinar and please put it on<br>the<br>chat function under q and a<br>not in the comments please and our<br>speaker will be able to see them and<br>you'll also be able to upload the<br>question to come first<br>and when we get to the end of the<br>session i pose all of the questions and<br>i'll be able to select some of the<br>questions<br>that a number of people who like to be<br>asked i also remind my fellow speakers<br>to put themselves on<br>mute when they're not speaking<br>and also reminding everyone that we are<br>recording this webinar and the recording<br>will be shared with<br>all of the attendees including<br>participants who have registered and<br>have not been able to join us today in a<br>couple of weeks<br>and<br>also reminding my fellow speakers that i<br>am in control of slides so you'll hear<br>them say next slide when they uh like me<br>to move on<br>so without further ado<br>i'd like to introduce our first speaker<br>dr faison ali<br>uh he's an associate professor in the<br>school of hospitality and technology<br>management muma college of business<br>university of south florida<br>and his topic is emerging trends so<br>first of all welcome frasier<br>thank you very much anji and um uh a<br>good day to everyone i literally am<br>looking at the future right now looking<br>at you and chris<br>both of you being in new zealand so uh<br>well uh before we go into the emerging<br>trends i would say that there's a famous<br>sport that says<br>there is future in the past right and so<br>before i go into imagine friends i would<br>really go into the past a little bit so<br>naji next play uh next slide please<br>okay so when we look at virtual reality<br>and augmented reality or mixed reality<br>and all these buzzwords that we are<br>listening to today um it seems like very<br>futuristic um or even today we don't<br>have a lot of stuff going on about these<br>terminologies interestingly in tourism<br>the first ever mention of virtual<br>reality and<br>or sort of augmented reality for tourism<br>was mentioned in 1996<br>which is quite old i mean if you really<br>think about it many students that i<br>teach today were not even born at that<br>time right so in 1996 it was the first<br>time when it was mentioned now<br>interestingly not only it was mentioned<br>but there was a counter<br>article that was published in the same<br>issue in tourism management in which it<br>was first mentioned so these two papers<br>that you see right in front of you they<br>were both published in the same issue<br>one of them calling it as a fact or<br>fantasy whereas another one is calling<br>it as a threat to travel and tourism now<br>i would let all the audience be the<br>judge of all this and decide whether<br>it's a threat whether it's a fact it's a<br>fantasy or whatnot now those of you who<br>are uh from florida and if you have been<br>to universal or disney or any of the<br>theme parks i would say that you would<br>really look at it as a reality of travel<br>and tourism happening today um all right<br>let's move forward and as you please<br>next next slide<br>now the first ever implementation of<br>virtual reality in travel and tourism<br>happened in again 1996 and right now<br>what you see in front of you is the<br>first example of how virtual reality was<br>implemented in disney and this article<br>actually was a conference paper that was<br>published<br>in academy of um marketing and it talks<br>about disney saladin which was the first<br>implementation so what you see right in<br>front of you is a screenshot of the<br>virtual environment where is this person<br>sitting on a<br>small right type of thing experiencing<br>the virtual reality now what's most<br>interesting is those of us who have used<br>oculus or any uh you know futuristic<br>goggles and<br>all those things this is the first ever<br>helmet or first ever device that was<br>used for virtual reality that you see on<br>your screen so<br>when i look at it from 1996 fast forward<br>to 2022 i think we have come a long way<br>and devices have changed quite a bit so<br>enough for the history let's move on a<br>little bit and see what else do we have<br>so since my topic um moves towards<br>emerging trends<br>next slide please<br>i'll tell you a little bit about what<br>has been happening in tourism research<br>so tourism research of course have<br>looked into virtual reality augmented<br>reality recently a little bit of mixed<br>reality and stuff like that um if i put<br>them into topical trends right so what<br>we have seen in the last decade decade<br>and a half<br>there's a lot of different things<br>grouping them would show us that most of<br>the research is application of uh<br>virtual and augmented reality in<br>different settings and we are lucky to<br>have professor timothy jang with us<br>today because he is one of the initial<br>people who started studying application<br>of virtual reality and augmented reality<br>into different settings like museums and<br>heritage sites and things like this um<br>so that's one major topic that we have<br>seen then another stream of research is<br>really towards acceptance and adoption<br>of these technologies and travel and<br>tourism now minded that most of this<br>research really looks like consumers<br>adoption and acceptance of these<br>technologies and not so much of other<br>stakeholders which is another issue i'll<br>talk about very quick then the third<br>stream of research is really about<br>consumer behavior related to um<br>augmented virtual reality and exas<br>which really deals with the quality of<br>what we are getting as a product right<br>so um the quality of the image the<br>quality of the information that's coming<br>out of it the overall service or system<br>quality the accuracy of information or<br>content that we are getting out of it so<br>that's another stream of research that<br>has been covered the fourth stream is<br>related to experiences so it's really<br>about telepresence that comes out of it<br>or flow or the interaction so i would<br>really call it as experiential or<br>memorable experiences that's another<br>stream of research that we have seen in<br>the past 10 to 15 years about mixed<br>reality or extended reality and tourism<br>then recently after kobe 19 there's some<br>research that you're looking at which is<br>offering these as alternate tourism<br>sources so more about eco-tourism or<br>more more about sustainable tourism or<br>more more about things where you cannot<br>go personally because of the things you<br>know coming out of coed so really<br>visiting places virtually without your<br>physical presence there and then the<br>last this this is not a stream but this<br>is more like application of research but<br>that is experiments so there's some<br>experiments that have been uh<br>implemented into studying uh<br>mixed reality but these experiments are<br>really looking at a very limited um<br>aspects of um xr which is about<br>atmospherics or design related stuff so<br>this is about tourism research if we sum<br>it up now of course research um<br>that is done in tourism is also<br>published in journals outside of tourism<br>domain like marketing or business<br>journals so if we go to next slide<br>please<br>there's some other research that is done<br>in mainstream marketing research or<br>mainstream business journals and they've<br>gone a little bit ahead of this so what<br>we see in those journals is a bit ahead<br>of what we have seen in tourism so um<br>three areas that i see that are not<br>covered in tourism that much are<br>communication and social media using<br>extended reality so some people are<br>covering aspects of youtube what happens<br>if youtube starts offering virtual<br>reality videos or augmented reality<br>videos um advertising already we have<br>seen some research coming out of<br>effectiveness of ar and we are in<br>advertising then experiments are way<br>ahead in mainstream business research so<br>we see people using eye gazing<br>eeg devices neuro stimulators heart rate<br>monitors things like this in mainstream<br>business research and lastly there's<br>also research that covers real<br>implementation of<br>extended realities of mixed reality so<br>new product development we know that<br>companies like ford is really<br>implementing uh virtual reality to test<br>the uh the cars and you know how strong<br>their cars are if there's an accident<br>collision or stuff like that<br>walmart and some other companies are<br>using it for training so we see that<br>research coming out similarly product<br>trials like nike has product trials some<br>other fashion retailers south korea is<br>very famous for this and then ikea is<br>doing it amazon is doing it so several<br>companies are doing product trials and<br>we see that type of stuff in mainstream<br>business research coming out now next<br>slide please<br>if we really talk about research and<br>that's what i conclude my presentation<br>with very soon we cannot go in isolation<br>with research so all this i just talked<br>about this is happening already in the<br>research field but what other stuff is<br>happening around us so we as human<br>beings what other stuff we are looking<br>at so there's a lot of things but i've<br>summarized the few things that are<br>important for<br>extended realities and one of them is a<br>discussion about<br>going beyond intentions or adoption of<br>technology and looking at people's<br>well-being or people's loneliness or<br>accessibility or people's with different<br>type of disabilities so that's a<br>discussion that is happening obviously<br>nothing directly related to xr but<br>there's a discussion about it another<br>discussion that we are seeing around us<br>from companies businesses is focusing on<br>experiences creating experiences going<br>beyond brands and really creating<br>experiences<br>we also have technology diffusion factor<br>more and more companies are getting into<br>technology there's big companies like<br>samsung lg sony microsoft intel all<br>these tech giants are getting into um<br>you know<br>xr mr ar vr all this stuff<br>the fourth thing that we see around this<br>is going beyond the wow factor so a few<br>years ago any company that was<br>implementing service robots or ar ovr<br>was really taken as a wow or a surprise<br>factor but now we are going into a into<br>a position where this is no more a wow<br>factor i mean people are used to it now<br>right so you have to go beyond that<br>there's also discussion about privacy<br>and personalization data privacy and<br>security of data and all those type of<br>things then there's legal discussions we<br>all know what happened last year that<br>the year before with google with<br>facebook with companies that are i'm<br>having a lot of data there's also a<br>discussion about academia and industry<br>gaps so whatever we are doing in<br>academia whatever industry needs there's<br>a big gap in it and then the last one is<br>the bitcoin factor or cryptocurrency or<br>nfps which really is leading to its<br>metaverse discussion so these are the<br>things that are going around us so what<br>i'll do is i'll take all this discussion<br>and what i just talked about what<br>research has been done about ar and vr<br>and xr and then i'll offer you 10<br>different questions or thought nuggets<br>that you can take from this webinar for<br>my part of the discussion and start<br>looking at it as future research stream<br>okay yes so the first question i have<br>for you is because there's a lot of<br>discussion about um you know<br>accessibility about acceptance of people<br>from different cultures and places like<br>that so the first question is can we use<br>xr to develop cultural awareness and<br>acceptance towards different differences<br>more effectively can this be used to do<br>that<br>the second question is can we use<br>different knowledge fields to boost<br>research on tourism and hospitality<br>context so why i say that is because<br>right now we are really at the surface<br>of implementing ar and vr<br>for instance um i'm part of a project<br>where we want to implement we are at a<br>at an island and the island actually uh<br>is having issues with many people<br>visiting there so we propose to them to<br>use ar and vr to help with that but the<br>problem is it's so remote that there's<br>no infrastructure so if there's no<br>infrastructure they cannot really<br>implement those type of things right so<br>we also have to see how we can bring<br>different knowledge fields to<br>have a better understanding of<br>implementation of xr into hospitality<br>and<br>tourism then the third one is<br>how multi-sensory virtual tourism<br>experiences can be implemented so we<br>already know that there are some<br>companies that are coming up with<br>different hardware like special shoes<br>that mimic walking haptic gloves<br>olfactory devices that can<br>that can engage other senses so if we<br>add those to virtual and augmented<br>reality or mixed reality uh what type of<br>experiences do we get um if anybody has<br>gone to<br>universal or disney you have seen that<br>recently they have started implementing<br>multi-sensory experiences by uh usage of<br>xr and vr<br>now once we have this the next question<br>would be is xr creating an enhancement<br>to traditional experience or is it a new<br>experience all together how do we<br>measure it how do we measure its<br>effectiveness<br>the fifth question i have for all of you<br>is uh we already see some application of<br>cyborgs mechanical limbs contact lenses<br>and stuff like this do we have a room to<br>merge xr with human body enhancements<br>can we use augmented reality uh contact<br>lenses instead of having um you know<br>glasses or stuff like that next slide<br>please and this is my last slide i<br>promise<br>so my sixth question is uh<br>najib one slide back please okay yeah my<br>sixth question is we already see that<br>there's some studies that show that<br>using xrs especially virtual reality can<br>create some short term health issues<br>like blood vision nausea headache etc we<br>don't have a lot of research about if<br>there's any long term health related<br>issues so would there be any long-term<br>health related issues if there are how<br>can service providers deal with that um<br>then we already see a rise in<br>cryptocurrencies virtual identities nfts<br>and you know metaverse related stuff so<br>in this situation in 2030 how do we<br>apply traditional marketing models what<br>happens to product price place promotion<br>do we have the same model implementing<br>for metawars or do we change it what<br>happens if there's a service failure in<br>matters do we apply the same<br>relationships between brand and consumer<br>same theories<br>do we have<br>can we draw this to the conclusion first<br>just one sound<br>and then the question number um it is we<br>know that there's devices involved into<br>this experience like microphones cameras<br>mobile devices and location and all this<br>so what are the legal and ethical issues<br>if we have this market with new types of<br>experiences what type of skills do we<br>need to instill in students who are in<br>hospitality and tourism programs and<br>then the last one is implementing newer<br>methodologies to really understand these<br>new experiences including<br>sensors monitors in real world<br>situations and probably using both<br>quantitative and qualitative<br>methodologies like analytics and virtual<br>ethnographies to understand this better<br>with this i'll stop thank you<br>thank you so much faizan uh<br>really interesting question and i think<br>there is a lot of potential for future<br>research uh including your presentation<br>thank you so much so we have our first<br>question pop-up and so if i remind you<br>i'll attend this if you have any<br>question put it in q a now like to turn<br>to our second uh speaker professor<br>timothy john he's the chair professor of<br>xr and director of creative ar and vr<br>hub<br>at metro manchester metropolis and<br>polite and university in uk and his<br>topic is<br>metaverse uh welcome timothy<br>right um<br>can you all hear me well<br>yeah<br>okay so thanks uh very much for your<br>invitation so it's great to uh speak<br>about kind of metabolism that function<br>to set up very nice kind of a scene<br>before i start the metabolism okay next<br>slide<br>please<br>so i think we are<br>experiencing a very interesting time so<br>we already started kind of extreme<br>digital transformation so digital<br>transformation is the process of using<br>uh digital text to create<br>or modify<br>existing<br>process or culture or<br>customer experience because of a lot of<br>changes of environment<br>and kobe actually made it happen is<br>accelerate this kind of digital<br>transformation<br>and therefore we are<br>have a very very uh different experience<br>uh at the moment<br>and also it's very important to look at<br>some<br>technological platform perspective<br>because<br>one time pc was one the main platform<br>and internet was the second platform and<br>mobile was the next play so so many new<br>companies like apple google or baseball<br>they emerged because of this new<br>platform and they dominated they uh all<br>kind of a<br>world economy in a way that they<br>actually helped to<br>exchange the idea and do the business<br>and then the what is the next platform<br>then everybody is talking about<br>metabolism because uh ar mvl is a great<br>technology to uh enhance the our<br>experience and time can be no time and<br>space can be virtual place so our time<br>and space can be expanded uh<br>without any limitation that's why<br>kind of a<br>albr has a more potential you know<br>attention so far now it has become a<br>main kind of platform next uh slide<br>please<br>so uh what is the metabolism there is no<br>specific definition so far so matter is<br>beyond the birth is universal so<br>the metabolism in one word is beyond<br>kind of our world but um<br>i'm kind of trying to work in definition<br>it's kind of augmented digital world<br>which is blending clearly it's physical<br>world and the virtual spaces but more<br>importantly these days this kind of arvl<br>based excel technology and ai technology<br>and intelligent cloud system is<br>is working together for users or for<br>travelers to interact and or experience<br>and not only that but trade and the<br>virtual goods and services through the<br>currency which called cryptocurrencies<br>or non-fungible tokens and nfc with one<br>another and other virtual entities it<br>means people can<br>interact and trade but also avatar we<br>can play around so i think whatever the<br>idea is started from the<br>the med kind of the uh<br>idea was uh exposed through the<br>led player one villain but it started<br>from gaming like roblox or<br>the<br>uh<br>like uh some of the entertainment they<br>started at this kind of metabolism and<br>they realize it's not only social<br>cultural space but they realize that it<br>can they can trade and they can make<br>lots of money in the virtual world i<br>think that actually makes<br>everybody think about<br>metabolism has a great picture that's<br>why facebook changes the meta and<br>microsoft they actually acquired one of<br>the biggest game company blizzard in<br>order to prepare this kind of metabolism<br>disney actually they appointed<br>like a future strategist to prepare<br>metabolism so whole world is kind of<br>preparing this kind of a metabolism at<br>the moment next slide please<br>so there are many cases in tourism uh<br>metabolism is kind of combination of<br>both physical and<br>virtual so<br>augmented reality is kind of you can do<br>do in a real<br>environment okay so pokemon go is one of<br>them the real world company they are<br>doing all the augmented reality game<br>which is perfect for the onsite<br>experience and middle world is<br>completely you in this kind of digital<br>twin idea so there are one compatible<br>real fishing so it looks like a real<br>fish area but people virtually they can<br>fishing together and compare together<br>and light blogging this is we already<br>know there's a social media like<br>facebook instagram<br>we are sharing our tourism experience<br>through this social media and virtual<br>world is now we start to see as a new uh<br>kind of uh uh cases it's completely<br>virtual world so for example<br>there are many uh museums they are going<br>complete virtual world and and so we for<br>example they start to sell<br>the<br>kind of<br>objects through the virtual and sandbox<br>they start to sell in a virtual property<br>so this kind of a complete virtual world<br>is emerging and there are more potential<br>uh<br>in in the future in tourism next slide<br>please<br>so i mean uh this is something i am uh<br>metabolism i mean we<br>we start to look at alvl excel and um<br>and we are more experienced because of<br>this pandemic but now we're just about<br>to start i don't think it's now but we<br>need to think about the future of the<br>metabolism based tourism so we need to<br>think about contents so any any content<br>like a pop culture esports dramas or<br>weapons or movies they can be suddenly<br>become very good contents for the<br>metaphors world and people can<br>experience through these contents and<br>also entertainment and social capability<br>and how we can expand this to have a<br>digital human experience i think digital<br>human uh from the ai technology is<br>becoming much much more powerful and<br>bigger player role okay<br>and also uh how to build a virtual<br>tour's metabolism platform which enables<br>the real and virtual interaction<br>experience so not only physical<br>experience but also virtual experience<br>will be uh important okay and also we<br>need to think about not only the aw<br>excel but ai and blockchain how cloud<br>technology how they can work together<br>okay they will develop by themselves but<br>how co evolution means they influence<br>each other especially this is the key<br>technological metaphors economy means<br>they start to do some business okay<br>economy right and also what kind of<br>business model can be created for<br>greater economy one of the biggest<br>advantages of<br>metabolism is everybody can make money<br>in the past<br>kind of platform uh owners like a<br>facebook microsoft they can actually<br>take advantage of all the monetary kind<br>of advantages but now everybody can get<br>some advantage okay from the metabolis<br>space and therefore there are lots of<br>ethical and regulatory issues to support<br>this kind of metabolism economy is<br>important especially ip shoes and<br>nfts okay<br>next slide please<br>this is my last slide so i thought about<br>kind of what kind of<br>main<br>research questions or<br>uh research direction will uh we we we<br>need to think about okay for the future<br>so at the moment there are many current<br>kind of uh<br>lot of opportunities and challenges uh<br>because of this kind of<br>metabolism technology okay so you know<br>social experience can be enhanced and<br>interactivity and service quality<br>collaboration cup creation value and the<br>trading of virtual product and the<br>creative economy which everybody can and<br>engaged and new business but those are<br>opportunities but there are some<br>challenges like technological complexity<br>legal issues who will order certain<br>content space regulation competition and<br>commissions<br>and ethical social issues and political<br>issues<br>so how<br>from tourism perspective how we can<br>define the methods okay what is the that<br>definition of metabolism in the context<br>of tourism and this is quite kind of a<br>important question in the future<br>especially it's not only by the kind of<br>awl technology but also ai cloud<br>blockchain typically work together and<br>maybe this physical virtual space will<br>expanded something beyond our uh<br>expectation or imagination okay so lots<br>of things can happen<br>and maybe in the future you know how<br>very practically you know how we can<br>create a metabolic business model in<br>this uh new and changing environment and<br>how we can utilize the analytics for the<br>real kind of a trading and<br>to the tourism business in the mecca bus<br>world and how you can<br>embrace those key technologies okay and<br>how we address ethical and regulate<br>issues and especially the experience is<br>different in a new methodological<br>approach okay<br>clearly we need that and how to measure<br>the experience and emotions all these<br>behavior okay and maybe if we have this<br>kind of uh like a<br>research then we may know<br>how uh some insight to future<br>implementation of metabolism in a more<br>suitable or sustainable way okay thanks<br>thank you very much for your attention<br>thank you so much simulsi it's really<br>fascinating to see<br>all of this<br>practically um could be an application<br>of metabolism in future<br>so we have some uh questions lined up<br>for later but first of all let's go to<br>our third and final speakers today dr<br>christopher maymon from victoria<br>university of malaytown bellington is<br>the research flow at the school of<br>psychology at victoria university of<br>bellington and<br>his topic is<br>uh<br>emotional experience welcome chris<br>um i want to start by first thanking uh<br>both ian and naji for inviting me to<br>speak at this event it's not not very<br>often that i have the opportunity to<br>speak to audiences outside of my main<br>area of research um and i appreciate<br>being able to contribute a voice to this<br>uh important discussion um so as the<br>slide shows my name is christopher<br>mayman i'm a postdoctoral research<br>fellow in the school of psychology uh at<br>victoria university of wellington uh new<br>zealand<br>um and more specifically what i do is i<br>lead a virtual reality laboratory here<br>at the school<br>um and in that lab our main focus is on<br>the study of emotional experiences uh in<br>real life but we use virtual reality<br>simply because it is this<br>far and away more effective tool to<br>induce or manipulate people's emotions<br>in the laboratory compared to every<br>other method that came before it so we<br>used to show people images and films or<br>ask them to recall memories<br>the the the change in emotion that we<br>would observe was tiny with those but<br>with vr it's profound um and so we use<br>vr as a tool which has led to some um<br>really interesting insights uh and some<br>of them i'm going to share with you here<br>and hopefully uh it'll be clear how some<br>of these are informing the predictions<br>that are coming<br>from me at the end um<br>so when i was thinking about this talk i<br>was a little bit worried that i would be<br>too far removed from the area of tourism<br>to provide any meaningful insights but<br>um after doing a little bit of reading<br>i've realized there's there's tremendous<br>overlap actually between uh<br>psychological emotion research and and<br>research into the tourism industry um<br>because the tourism industry relies upon<br>uh emotional experiences if we if we<br>weren't if we didn't have emotional<br>experiences uh there probably wouldn't<br>be a tourism industry i mean if i want<br>to go on a holiday to say fiji it's not<br>because<br>i as a human being uh and at my best or<br>most optimal when i am you know sitting<br>on a sandy beach with my feet in the<br>water it's because for whatever reason<br>being there induces the emotion<br>relaxation<br>um<br>so i think<br>the field of tourism and and uh our<br>tourism research and emotion research<br>it's like we're looking at the same<br>thing but we're asking very slightly<br>different questions<br>um however one thing i noticed is that<br>uh<br>the real difference i i've seen between<br>uh what psychological scientists like<br>myself think emotions are and and what<br>the tourism industry thinks emotions are<br>there there's a bit of a difference<br>there and so what i want to start by<br>doing is sort of describing what<br>emotions are from from my perspective on<br>some<br>so<br>uh when we talk about emotions what we<br>recognize as emotions within ourselves<br>is actually comprised of three<br>categories of changes um that happen in<br>real time that evolve and fluctuate over<br>time the first is what we call feelings<br>and this is just what we call our<br>emotions so if i say to you how happy<br>are you right now and you tell me<br>sincerely uh poor well that is your<br>subjective<br>happiness it's it's what you think it is<br>we have to trust you as long as you're<br>not deliberately lying to me that is<br>your subjective uh happiness but<br>that's not all it is um emotions also uh<br>come with a host of changes inside our<br>body that are meant to prepare us for<br>what we think is coming um so this is<br>our physiological arousal um we might<br>notice a change in our heart rate if<br>we're afraid we might notice that uh our<br>skin starts to<br>sweat as well or that we might start to<br>breathe more rapidly um and all of these<br>physiological changes are in preparation<br>for changes in our behavior changes in<br>action to uh lead us to uh be more<br>prepared for what we think might be<br>coming our way so if we are relaxed our<br>body might feel quite loose if we're uh<br>afraid we might tense up we might be<br>immobilized by fear<br>um and all of those things are<br>important not just for talking about<br>emotions and describing them but<br>actually for being able to recognize<br>them and i think this is something that<br>the field of tourism uh<br>the tourism industry needs also to to<br>focus on a lot because<br>it seems that<br>much that much of the field is uh is<br>trying to make predictions about how<br>people feel um when they use this<br>different technology<br>but<br>how somebody feels is this very messy<br>uh you know set of of corresponding<br>changes that that are related to each<br>other sometimes but only only in some<br>people and it's actually a very messy uh<br>puzzle that we that i think is common<br>across<br>both fields here not just uh us as<br>psychological scientists trying to<br>understand uh emotions in real life but<br>also um<br>uh the ability to predict how people are<br>going to feel when they engage with<br>different products and experiences<br>um and one thing that i also um was<br>quite pleased to see and when i was<br>looking into this uh tourism research<br>was um a strong focus on on presence<br>because i'm i am also very interested in<br>presence in our lab and actually we've<br>been doing some research over the last<br>couple of years to try and understand<br>how<br>presence which is the subjective sense<br>of<br>being there so how much we feel like we<br>are actually in a place<br>um<br>how that changes as a function of uh<br>what what emotions we feel and the<br>intensity of those emotions<br>um<br>and<br>you've probably heard a lot about<br>presence already because<br>across<br>the tourism industry presence is also<br>considered the the key<br>to<br>uh making people feel something and and<br>therefore promoting engagement with um<br>with products and experiences<br>um<br>so as i said we've been doing some<br>research into this and so uh nash you<br>can go to the next slide here so uh in<br>this particular piece of research we uh<br>created<br>this simulation uh that we call plank<br>walk and a lot of other people have also<br>tried to do this and it's obviously<br>designed to induce fear um and i was<br>going to provide some data to show that<br>actually it doesn't do sphere but uh<br>it's so reliable and uh effective that<br>um i find that<br>all i really need to do is show people<br>the image and usually it's it's<br>convincing enough without bringing<br>graphs and things into it<br>um so we use this to uh induce fear and<br>then in another set of um of studies now<br>you can go on to the next slide please<br>so<br>i don't know if these images are going<br>to be very clear to you to everyone at<br>home but uh in this set of uh studies we<br>are looking at trying to induce the<br>emotion awe in the same way so we put<br>people into this virtual reality<br>spaceship that has a windows that close<br>around and<br>at three different time points the<br>windows open up and outside you see<br>either uh this kind of space environment<br>with<br>a sun and some some planets or you see<br>that you're underwater and there are<br>these whales all around you or you're in<br>this huge mountain range scene<br>and the reason i wanted to focus on<br>these two studies is because what we've<br>just found recently is that<br>in both of these studies<br>there is this tight relationship between<br>how emotional people feel they are so<br>the extent to which the plank makes them<br>feel more fear or the extent to which<br>each of these environments makes them<br>feel more awe and their subjective<br>presence<br>and this i think is really interesting<br>because<br>it means that<br>this relationship between how i<br>feel emotionally and how much i feel<br>like i am there that i am at the helm of<br>my own experience<br>it's it's not dependent upon whether<br>it's an a pleasant or an unpleasant<br>emotional experience this is something<br>that is tied fundamentally to our<br>emotional experiences<br>and um so i'm gonna bring that back<br>later when i when i get to my uh<br>predictions but naji can go on to the<br>next slide<br>so here is where i think things get uh<br>really interesting um so this is another<br>piece of research that we did uh in<br>conjunction with the department of<br>conservation here in new zealand earlier<br>this year and actually the idea of of<br>this research was to give people this<br>experience of being in a in a real place<br>so this is actually the uh the uh ota<br>viaduct which is uh in the in the south<br>island of new zealand and it's a very<br>very popular lookout um<br>uh overlooking this mountain range of<br>course and what we were actually<br>interested in looking at is how people<br>uh<br>remembered and paid attention to<br>different signs that we put into the<br>environment um and to do that of course<br>we needed people to first feel like they<br>were actually in these environments<br>and while that research was you know<br>interesting in its own respect what we<br>found really fascinating was what we<br>weren't expecting to find which was just<br>how<br>automatically people seemed to<br>treat this place as if it was a real<br>place and so what i mean by that<br>um in one case uh i i had there was this<br>there was a man who was in the uh the<br>headset i was behind him uh taking some<br>some uh note of what he was feeling and<br>what he was saying and he would say<br>things like<br>ah this is exactly<br>uh how it looked when i was just when i<br>was here last year or or you could say<br>my wife was standing over there um the<br>last time i was here<br>they would describe it as if it was<br>where they were not<br>just a rep not just a a reflection of<br>pictures or something like that they<br>weren't describing it as media they were<br>describing it as if they were as if i<br>had somehow<br>portaled them there<br>and<br>this made us wonder<br>when they later on if they were to think<br>back on their memories in their life of<br>going to this place in the south island<br>where would the experience of being in<br>that experiment fit<br>would they think of it as a separate<br>category oh i went to the south island a<br>couple of times and then this one time i<br>i had a mix i was in an experiment where<br>i was in vr in that environment or<br>would this be<br>would they think of this as part of the<br>same<br>collection of experiences like would<br>they treat this<br>as if this was another visit to the<br>south island<br>and so<br>with those questions in mind i think we<br>so i wanted to make both some safe<br>predictions and then some<br>i'm going to call them scarier<br>predictions but some things i'm a little<br>bit worried about here um in terms of<br>what might happen in the future<br>um<br>when when when we're all a lot more<br>invested in being in uh headsets of<br>various kinds<br>of vr or ar i think it's safe to say<br>that that vr is here to stay when it<br>comes to uh destination selection so<br>like tourism marketing and deciding<br>where i want to go for my holiday um and<br>i think that we'll probably use these<br>different technologies to um<br>uh to bring other people with us to<br>these places or to uh to try and capture<br>these places uh not as a as a camera<br>like this but using that 360 camera so<br>people can experience it in their own<br>headset i think i think that's probably<br>going to happen but what i'm what i also<br>think could happen<br>is that if we visit a place in vr before<br>we go there in real life<br>i think there's a real risk that<br>we<br>spoil that first experience a little bit<br>um that people<br>might have that there's something<br>special about going to a place and being<br>immersed and present in a place for the<br>very first time and that by doing that<br>in vr<br>we might actually be taking away<br>something something potentially kind of<br>essential about<br>that initial experience in a place<br>um and it might lead us to feel a little<br>bit more disappointed when we get there<br>in person especially because we might<br>notice things<br>in person that we didn't notice when we<br>saw it in vr like maybe there's trash on<br>the ground or or something like that or<br>maybe there's a little bit of smog in<br>here<br>um<br>um so i think the way we encode memories<br>in vr<br>uh may be no different than the way we<br>encode memories outside vr and i think<br>that could have some<br>problematic implications<br>about<br>how we how we think about our life<br>narrative<br>and the way that it might exist in both<br>real life and vr<br>um so with that i think i think i'll uh<br>thank you so much chris really<br>fascinating and<br>um<br>it's fascinating to see that<br>multidisciplinary nature of tourism<br>allows it to be connected to<br>other contexts so well<br>so now uh thank you so much to all of<br>the speakers and for the really<br>insightful and well connected<br>presentation<br>so now i'm gonna stop the share screen<br>and<br>go to the questions<br>um<br>so when we go<br>to the questions so there are lots of<br>questions out there so i'm gonna start<br>with the first one<br>uh<br>how<br>we have a question from sean<br>and says that how do you see in this in<br>a relationship relation of information<br>overload will the phenomena like ease of<br>changing windows<br>like with a click<br>effect virtual tourism will scope for<br>increase so um<br>faison would you like to start with this<br>one<br>yeah sure thank you yeah so i i tried to<br>answer this in in the chat as well i um<br>unknown this is unknown right because<br>when things change and the way people<br>use things then their consumer behavior<br>or the user behavior also changes<br>it's the same when people used to watch<br>tv for hours and now you know the<br>attention span for watching videos is<br>eight seconds so we cannot say before we<br>go into this research and go<br>my question one of the thought nuggets i<br>presented was exactly the same thing<br>with the matter was with the increase of<br>these technologies we need to think<br>whether the existing consumer behavior<br>theories or our understanding of<br>consumer behavior is going to apply or<br>will it change<br>apparently from now like if we look at<br>it from now on certainly the information<br>overload is going to increase<br>the confusion is going to increase but<br>so will the consumer behavior so this is<br>something we have to see<br>thank you so much faisa<br>uh so the next question let's go to<br>uh this one on<br>metaverse in metaverse tourists can walk<br>in hotels and see their room size decor<br>and<br>room features in this way<br>can bu reservation uh<br>can be increased by giving a sense of<br>trust to tourists and can increase their<br>revenues by using the metaphors by say<br>for sales and marketing purposes<br>so timothy i think<br>if you like you can take this question<br>now<br>sorry i was muted so<br>it's question from eunice yes so uh like<br>a tourist can work in hotels see the<br>room size decoration room features<br>i mean the<br>al and vr technology or in the metaverse<br>uh context what technology makes happen<br>is kind of uh uh the limitation of a<br>space actually can be uh resolved in a<br>way okay the question is what is a how<br>real is a different method but if if<br>they feel like uh<br>you know they have a real kind of<br>pedestrian with a real experience that<br>will give much more like a competence<br>and also this will give you uh for the<br>companies not only this physical kind of<br>a business side of it but virtually they<br>can actually uh have a<br>much more business opportunity for<br>example if you look at some kind of uh<br>uh entertainment business you know they<br>used to uh kind of do the you know<br>performance you know uh and um<br>and and<br>they're physically they were limited but<br>kind of during the pandemic what they<br>done is that you know they actually do<br>the performance online but like for<br>example one of the famous group in the<br>world is korean in a bts they did this<br>kind of online kind of concert and<br>they actually made them more money than<br>actual you know physical tour right so i<br>think these kind of things like<br>uh<br>uh happen uh<br>it can happen in in the tourism so i<br>think it will be additional but uh kind<br>of a way of<br>like<br>creating revenue uh for the tourism<br>business okay is that some kind of a<br>answer for the question yes it's kind of<br>a revenue and sales and marketing<br>purpose so actually think about your<br>physical space limited your fiscal<br>business limited but your virtual<br>tourism business can be<br>expanded anywhere in the world if your<br>metabolism space is really attractive<br>okay and that<br>uh because of people during the pandemic<br>they already kind of experiment all this<br>kind of virtual experience so i think if<br>we can provide both critical a really a<br>good combination in harmony balance<br>between physical and virtual experience<br>together<br>through the metaphors concept yes there<br>are some opportunities for much more can<br>generate revenues and marketing and<br>sales<br>that is already happening in other<br>sectors<br>okay<br>thank you so much timothy<br>uh so we have a question from katie<br>which i think goes to faison<br>what do you mean by going beyond<br>intention individual happiness what<br>what was happening before and what is<br>changing i tell people accessing this<br>gadget for happiness<br>sure thank you yeah so my point earlier<br>actually was about research right so<br>most of the research that we see right<br>now in terms of consumers it's focusing<br>on intentions to use or<br>acceptance or adoption and things like<br>this however<br>we don't have a lot of research that<br>really digs into what benefits people<br>can get out of it i think in the whole<br>world right now we have a problem of<br>aging populations right in many<br>countries and with aging comes<br>loneliness and other problems um so for<br>example in japan there's a rise of<br>companion robot sales and the reason is<br>to counter loneliness and<br>aging issues right so my point was<br>actually to see if we can use xr<br>to counter loneliness which obviously<br>can lead to long-term well-being and<br>life satisfaction and happiness<br>thank you so much<br>so we have another question from sean<br>for chris<br>uh hi christopher in continuation um to<br>scarier prediction<br>what are your thoughts on the risk of<br>people start using this on animals<br>particularly manipulating their emotions<br>what checks can we have<br>wow that is actually a very interesting<br>question um that i definitely haven't<br>gotten before um<br>uh there's there's not a lot of research<br>on what animals uh<br>think about being in vr though well<br>actually there's some there's some<br>research using mice but<br>um<br>it's hard to tell what what mice are<br>actually<br>um feeling i think what the the concern<br>that you're probably raising is more<br>like people doing this to their pets<br>um or or to maybe maybe great apes who<br>have uh the the ability to<br>who have some greater higher cognition<br>functions<br>unfortunately i think that the way it's<br>going to end up working is that uh<br>the checks that we develop for that kind<br>of thing will probably be more reactive<br>than proactive because i think it's such<br>an open question i'm not<br>i'm not i'm not sure<br>how they would respond to it um but i<br>think that<br>because we empathize with<br>animals and and we can<br>their emotions are just as visible to us<br>as our own emotions are visible to one<br>another um i think that uh<br>you know we will be able to see<br>if you know there are problems that are<br>arising as a result of people doing that<br>um and and i i'm not sure how<br>technologically we will develop checks<br>on that but<br>um<br>i i i think that you know<br>the way that videos go viral i i don't<br>think it'll take long for people to<br>to recognize that that needs to be<br>uh<br>controlled what i can't tell you i have<br>no idea about is how you would actually<br>control that<br>um so i i apologize that's not the most<br>satisfying of answers but um that's what<br>i that that's kind of as far as i think<br>i can predict down that road<br>thank you so much chris<br>so we have a question from riley<br>the formation of metaphors required<br>decentralization<br>so in a completely free market<br>environment will regulation be a problem<br>for example bitcoin because of its uh<br>decentralization and privacy it has<br>become a currency favored by criminal<br>groups to trade<br>what if the metabours encounter the same<br>issues uh timothy would you like to<br>answer this question please well what<br>anybody can answer this<br>question okay i will start my answer<br>okay so yes i think that is quite true<br>why the bitcoin is kind of uh it's<br>popular because of the privacy nobody<br>knows okay and at the moment all the um<br>the concept of metabolism is<br>decentralization deep democratization<br>because that is already the power<br>already using power the governed all the<br>systems financial systems or economic<br>system but but this kind of uh<br>the metabolism especially blockchain is<br>why it's important because it is<br>decentralizing you give more democracy<br>so in more people the free freedom or<br>just kind of avoid some existing you<br>know<br>governance okay however uh at the same<br>time because of this bitcoin uh this<br>private decentralization it can be used<br>by the criminals okay highly possible<br>the question is but in the mecca bus<br>because of your trading uh the virtual<br>objects and<br>products<br>using existing currency is not gonna<br>work okay you have a virtual experience<br>and you want to pay card in the virtual<br>environment no<br>so therefore you need this kind of uh uh<br>the currency which can be used by<br>any kind of a<br>anybody in this kind of a metaphase<br>okay that's why uh certain uh at the<br>moment all the kind of a financial<br>system or political system or economic<br>system is governed by country or certain<br>you know uh like a continent some sort<br>of organization but in metabolism world<br>it's not like that for some facebook<br>users instagram users there are 20<br>million you know 200 million users from<br>everywhere anyway in the in the world<br>okay so therefore you need a different<br>type of<br>currency different types of way of doing<br>things okay that's why<br>uh it<br>brings lots of uh questions challenges<br>about who owns this who will regulate i<br>think it's still open because<br>the<br>few kind of a tech company like a<br>facebook or metal or microsoft or amazon<br>actually they want to be or<br>again want to own this kind of a<br>metaphors<br>space uh exactly what they used to do uh<br>kind of a they dominated platform like a<br>social media platform okay so i think it<br>brings a lot of a lot of questions okay<br>about this<br>um legal issues okay and also equality<br>issue i think ryan young at the bottom<br>ask a question about kind of a uh is is<br>any implication about social economic<br>inequalities yes there will be okay some<br>inequality if it is being dominated by<br>number of big tech giant okay so now<br>it's it's time for us to kind of we<br>question is about how we can kind of get<br>involved because the matter was idea<br>as soon as we used that with blockchain<br>it is the idea of<br>decentralization the democratization<br>which means more people get benefit so i<br>think it's<br>a really important time for so many kind<br>of people to realize these trends and<br>changes and get involved in this kind of<br>a movement and try to participate how we<br>will regulate not leaving that to some<br>pure big tech giants so i think it's<br>really uh<br>fascinating idea but also very dangerous<br>time and also it's a very important time<br>to make these metaphors is more<br>uh<br>what's what is the word kind of uh<br>uh not profitable it's it's it's not<br>economic world it's a it's it's good for<br>everyone okay so i think it's quite<br>important to understand this technology<br>and make some actions okay<br>thank you so much timothy<br>so we i'm gonna go to the last question<br>because of timing um<br>for chris from violet<br>um<br>she's wondering how you differentiate uh<br>psychology and feeling in diagram we<br>have one minute to answer this question<br>sure well i i can uh do this one in a<br>pretty short amount of time so you're<br>absolutely right feeling is definitely<br>part of<br>uh the overall view of emotion but also<br>part of what psychology views emotions<br>as the difference really is that<br>and this is not just in the case of<br>tourism um<br>in the industry but actually most other<br>fields that talk about emotions outside<br>of psychology is there's a real focus<br>exclusively on<br>uh what people describe their emotions<br>as and so what i meant to show in that<br>diagram was that emotions have these two<br>other components that are crucial um and<br>that the overall picture includes<br>feelings but it's not feelings as what<br>we described but it's not surely that<br>and we have to reckon with the<br>relationship between what our body does<br>when we feel these emotions and what we<br>do when we describe them<br>so that that i hope that clarifies the<br>difference thank you so much chris so we<br>need to wrap it up now uh thank you so<br>much i'm sorry that we didn't get to<br>last couple of questions<br>uh i just need to remind our next<br>webinar will be on on 24th of february 3<br>p.m<br>in association with asian development<br>bank and the question is does<br>tourism have a future in pacific islands<br>and after that we have another one on<br>15th of march<br>9 15 a.m which is a book launch<br>on science fiction tourism and<br>disruption<br>thank you so much everybody on behalf of<br>university a huge thanks to our our tree<br>speaker<br>it was a pleasure and thank you so much<br>i think everybody's starting to<br>disappear and go out but again um<br>i've lost i think i've lost angie<br>um<br>just on a personal thank you very much<br>um<br>to timothy it's probably good night<br>yes i'm gonna have a<br>yeah go to bed so good night to to fasan<br>i don't know what time it is i presume<br>it's about five six o'clock in florida<br>uh yes it's uh it's around four p.m but<br>my kids just came back from school so i<br>have my day just started<br>i think you're quite right it's busier<br>now than you you will have so some of my<br>colleagues look forward to coming to<br>work<br>um but it's fun and christopher it's<br>good morning to you you've got your day<br>ahead of you<br>uh louisa thank you very much for um<br>for being in the background and<br>supporting and nanji's<br>and nanji's disappeared and again she's<br>done she's done a wonderful job and<br>i'll formally send you an email and the<br>next day or two and and this recording<br>will<br>go online and<br>it<br>takes about two two weeks depending on<br>our home recommend stuff like that but<br>it's been a pleasure and<br>just one final thing if if you're<br>organizing a webinar sudden or anything<br>like that any way we can help with<br>from victoria university in terms of<br>speakers or participation or whatever<br>you want to do<br>please just please just ask but um i<br>know this thing has been very insightful<br>for nanji<br>and she's very grateful for your time<br>and<br>if you were if you were in new zealand<br>that it would be time to go<br>well we attempted to be going for a<br>coffee or by or having a glass of wine<br>or a beer<br>and<br>but it's a bit too it's a bit too early<br>um<br>or a b or a wine or but<br>just to drink to socialize because then<br>one of the things we do miss is that the<br>physical presence which<br>in 2030 might be a hybrid but thank you<br>thank you i i start um<br>like physical conference this may so i'm<br>you know in lisbon it's an international<br>exile conference which i'm learning<br>every year<br>and um hopefully things<br>yeah since it's going well i'm i mean we<br>have some people who want just<br>participating online but also there are<br>strong kind of uh<br>uh you know expectation and intention to<br>to have a physical conference as well so<br>looking forward quite busy to preparing<br>the conference of a hundred kind of a<br>submissions papers uh both academic<br>industries so i think you know quite<br>physical that and then we're looking<br>forward to that<br>i think at the moment um<br>many of us here in new zealand are<br>trying to get out of the country but the<br>problem is we can leave but we can't<br>come back<br>i think in europe i think it's<br>we you know in the uk as you know<br>there's no kind of restriction in terms<br>of uh separate isolation anymore so<br>people now start book holiday<br>uh in the easter<br>at the moment yeah so<br>tourism industries is now start to you<br>know boost now in the uk and europe okay<br>that's a good sign it has it's it's many<br>years since i've been to manchester and<br>the only thing i remember about<br>manchester is going to um the coronation<br>street theme pub at granada<br>yeah yeah yeah i said that bbc is the<br>studio yeah yeah yeah so it's been it's<br>been a while but<br>it's been a while but it's a lovely<br>place and nancy welcome back and again<br>thank you you were very gracious today<br>and well then it's a sharing session<br>it's uh you know<br>it's sometimes challenging but you did<br>well today<br>thank you so much thanks<br>again i really i'm proud to be here and<br>thank you so much<br>um<br>that's<br>i'm<br>just<br>seeing all the people that i'm citing<br>them in my research i'm referring to<br>your papers all of you<br>all the time so it's a really pleasure<br>for for me to share this webinar and be<br>here<br>so now this is being pitched in the<br>awl excel<br>yes actually um my title is um<br>impact of extra technologies on tourist<br>emotion and behavior<br>right okay i see<br>very important topic okay um so i'm sure<br>you will lots of food for thought in<br>terms of methodology and<br>subject research context and sampling<br>you know experiment or you know lots of<br>different idea at the moment yeah<br>yes yes actually uh it's been a<br>challenge but<br>uh chris<br>was the one who has saved me a lot in<br>terms of collecting data and doing<br>experiment i really like i want to thank<br>chris for that because um<br>i'm doing research but practically when<br>you're facing with technology we need<br>someone who<br>is expert in searching and finding a<br>solution so yeah it's been a challenge<br>but<br>um we're looking to the future<br>yeah especially the methodology yeah i<br>mean the feinstein is is a great you<br>know expert in the methodology and<br>this is one of the area which i am kind<br>of interested in<br>uh you know<br>we need a new methodological approach to<br>measure either experience emotion or<br>whatever the experience not only<br>physical side of it but you know you<br>know<br>more virtual combination of physical and<br>virtual metaphors<br>you need a whole kind of a<br>maybe traditional<br>conventional methodology may not<br>sufficient to<br>kind of a<br>measure<br>real kind of experience or emotion so<br>you know that is the whole kind of new<br>area for<br>lots of lots of uh you know interest<br>even the companies you know i am at the<br>moment you know<br>i'm also doing lots of health care in<br>outside tourism project at the moment<br>and many companies are interested in so<br>it's you know real experience and um a<br>real experience and the online<br>experience which one is better which is<br>cost effective and where we should<br>invest you know from the company's point<br>of view okay healthcare system education<br>system so i think it's all question is<br>very very<br>uh important and maybe experiment<br>research is quite you know useful at the<br>moment i suppose yeah yeah<br>actually i'm i'm using a mix method<br>and uh i'm learning from ian ma and<br>inaurationberger my other supervisor in<br>terms of qualitative<br>and faison also is expert in terms of<br>quantitative methodology methodology and<br>structural equation modeling and i'm<br>leveling<br>yeah<br>i mean there are companies like a tesla<br>suit or like lux labs they do the ehi<br>tracking and they wear the you know<br>clothes and they actually met all the<br>behavior the companies are offering that<br>kind of uh<br>uh<br>like a you know<br>the technology is there so his question<br>is how the academics can work together<br>with their technology partners and<br>create kind of a<br>right methodological approach which you<br>know should be available for academics<br>to write paper<br>at the same time the company can use<br>their methodology to prove that<br>what they're offering through the air<br>via excel<br>is more appealing or better or more<br>successful you know i think industry<br>want to also want to uh like we need a<br>research-based evidence so i think<br>little balls academics and this area<br>which is<br>more interesting lots of uh<br>interesting more interest in this area<br>but not sufficiently<br>uh developed methodological approach at<br>the moment that's that's what i see at<br>the moment yeah<br>well i'm sure you know<br>uh other you know<br>you you have some some idea but um<br>that's kind of my current kind of<br>thought at the moment<br>it's absolutely correct professor jung i<br>think um like i said uh in my assessment<br>of the research i've done several review<br>papers right and most of them are<br>survey-based<br>which many companies may not be<br>interested in because it doesn't really<br>give you anything real actionable<br>right so<br>um that's why i actually recently got a<br>paper rejected from a journal which i'm<br>thinking to send to ian because the<br>comment that i got was very interesting<br>they said it's too futuristic so<br>okay that is interesting so probably<br>tourism futures may be a good place to<br>send it to<br>uh in which we talked about cyborgs and<br>robotic arms and probably a body<br>enhancement to use<br>augmented uh devices<br>so anyways um you are absolutely right i<br>think we need newer methodologies we<br>need newer ways of looking at stuff plus<br>also i look at my kids now both of them<br>seven and six they are playing games<br>like minecraft and other things and they<br>have their own digital identities in<br>those games and there's a very clear<br>difference on in how they behave at home<br>but the moment they start playing then<br>there's a sudden personality shift<br>the way they talk the way they do things<br>you know excitement everything is so<br>different<br>now<br>we have looked at some research there's<br>some research coming out which is<br>looking at people's experience but they<br>do it after the peak time is gone which<br>probably chris would be the right person<br>to talk about this more i just feel that<br>most of the research right now is not<br>really capturing that<br>and so people are<br>during consumption right rather than<br>after consumption<br>exactly<br>that's more post-event kind of uh<br>self-report type even the interview is<br>more filtered already and the survey is<br>you already experienced but you never<br>know exactly that within that during 10<br>minutes<br>you know i think there's lots of like<br>emotional you know up and down<br>excitement you know lots of uh<br>it changes but<br>it's exactly where and when happen you<br>know<br>survey is not going to kind of<br>you know measure you know catch that in<br>a specific time and specific uh moment<br>so you know that's the kind of a<br>limitation of the<br>the<br>current kind of research methodology<br>especially<br>i mean it was okay so far but i think if<br>we start to look at all the more like<br>virtual you know combination of the you<br>know afr you know experience then um we<br>realized that more and more people<br>realize that existing methodology may<br>not<br>sufficient okay<br>to to to to measure okay yeah that's<br>that's what that many more more and more<br>researchers are now thinking about that<br>at the moment<br>yeah i i think that what we need um here<br>as well as a study that shows uh the<br>effective rep of repeated exposure to<br>emotional events over time and how that<br>whether or not you know if it's a<br>different emotion each time or if it's<br>the same emotion the same experience<br>what happens after that first one you<br>know because i i don't know if you have<br>this experience as well but everyone who<br>i bring into my lab when i put them on<br>the plank or something they have this<br>pretty uh astonishingly profound<br>emotional experience and some of those<br>people become my students and i end up<br>having them go into the experience more<br>and more sometimes i have them try and<br>like build aspects of it and so they're<br>in vr and now they're standing off the<br>plank trying to like position it and i'm<br>just like you don't seem afraid at all<br>anymore um and so<br>and so this happens relatively quickly<br>where this emotional experience that we<br>have the very first one is special but<br>then at some point<br>it it drops away um and now the thing<br>that used to terrify you just no longer<br>does at all i mean i i can go on that<br>that plank and i don't i don't even<br>think of it the same way<br>anymore and and so i think that i was<br>looking for this paper because i thought<br>that it could really inform my talk<br>i couldn't find this paper anywhere i<br>don't think anyone's done it where they<br>look at<br>uh yeah these these the the effective<br>repetitious vr experiences on the uh<br>emotional elicitation um and i think<br>that's what we really need to see<br>because that's that's the real question<br>i think that we're faced with is when<br>people get a vr headset that they have<br>you know in their house at all times<br>they're going to be using it all the<br>time it's not just that first experience<br>and what's that going to really do to<br>people in the long term<br>and will it always be as effective i<br>don't know<br>but i think i think uh i think we<br>started this kind of awr project 2013 14<br>15<br>and we did a like a ar pr project and<br>it's always a wow factor for the first<br>time users and then<br>that kind of uh the the wow factor<br>you know decreased dramatically okay<br>so<br>one time second time third time you know<br>so much difference and also those people<br>who are exposed to this vr experience<br>many times and the first time there are<br>so much kind of a<br>different degree of reactions from the<br>you know the people that the users okay<br>and my my girls unfortunately they they<br>are the one of the first kind of uh<br>you know girls who tried to google glass<br>and samsung gear vr but um they never<br>you know say wow<br>because<br>when when they were five or six years<br>old they only tried it okay and um okay<br>so<br>this is interesting okay but um<br>certainly that might affect yeah you<br>know<br>people<br>i have a<br>question<br>you just said something which is very<br>interesting right so that's right if the<br>first time you use anything like this<br>there's a wow effect or maybe even<br>second time but then it diminishes<br>slowly gradually right but that doesn't<br>happen with everything i mean like just<br>imagine you are korean uh by birth so if<br>you are in manchester you look at a<br>korean restaurant you really like it<br>every time you want to go there you have<br>anticipation the more you go the more<br>anticipation you have right so you value<br>it so i think the question would also be<br>when you use a vr based experience or ar<br>based experience<br>where do you see that augmented or<br>virtual element right is it really an<br>augment to you or is it really the main<br>experience<br>so for certain things you would see if<br>you value them a lot the more you do the<br>more anticipated you are for it<br>but then for this one you are absolutely<br>right like the more you do it the less<br>you become<br>wow or surprised or you even value it<br>anymore<br>and also it's interesting point is it<br>really wow it's always good or not maybe<br>tourists you know yeah it's just one<br>experience wow it's so important but<br>you know<br>it's it depends on the context depends<br>on the contents if you always want to<br>give a wow wow wow sometimes education<br>is not really great okay<br>so you know the experience should be<br>feels like a real louder than so many so<br>much wow so it depends on the<br>like what kind of uh what's the purpose<br>of providing this real experience what<br>kind of contents what can what kind of<br>context you you are offering these two<br>okay tourism you need some wow because<br>you know<br>industry itself okay you you you kind of<br>probably give some great experience<br>memorable okay and the unique you know<br>multi-sensory experience so tourism<br>maybe<br>kind of a it's close to wow factor it's<br>gonna work but when it comes to like uh<br>very uh different education or<br>healthcare in a very delicate situation<br>if too many wows may not really great<br>things<br>yeah i i very much agree uh friends i<br>have to unfortunately head off to um to<br>the university myself to go to some<br>other meetings i'd love to stick around<br>and chat<br>this is fascinating um but thank you so<br>much again for including me in the<br>discussion thank you thank you so much<br>chris<br>okay<br>great thank you<br>all right<br>thank you everyone thank you professor<br>jung good to see you again we'll meet<br>one of the things i am trying to do is<br>um in my own company i bring the<br>companies and the researchers<br>especially real researchers who<br>i mean it's a multi-disciplinary not<br>only tourism but kind of any<br>like a health care or education<br>and trying to do some workshop and<br>trying to develop some kind of a<br>research agenda about risk methodology<br>in excel or metaphors<br>which is um<br>needed so<br>maybe you know<br>you're interested in somebody who knows<br>the best stories very well i think it's<br>well suited because without foundation<br>you know just jumping through this exam<br>as well it doesn't make sense okay<br>yes<br>um yeah i'll be happy to work with you<br>if that is something you want to do<br>right in the future moving forward with<br>methodologies and uh yeah<br>sounds interesting<br>yeah so<br>uh yeah okay<br>all right thank you very much professor<br>zhang thank you ian uh i will give you a<br>call on whatsapp so we can talk about<br>the meeting okay thank you<br>thank you okay<br>thank you<br>thank you so much yeah okay<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
