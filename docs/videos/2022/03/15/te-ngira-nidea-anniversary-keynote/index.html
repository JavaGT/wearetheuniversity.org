of those who have sat with<br>nyria in some form over the last 10<br>years and before that the population<br>study centre<br>i'd especially like to acknowledge fito<br>for starting ahui in the right way thank<br>you fetu<br>our current director professor francis<br>collins<br>our<br>founding director professor natalie<br>jackson from whom i learnt so much<br>our emeritus professors who are the<br>ruduhi and koroheki of nydia<br>professor ian paul who will be joining<br>us later on professor dick bedford<br>um<br>dame<br>professor dame so hard when you've got<br>so many titles professor dame peggy<br>greetman boyden<br>um and professor jacques pote<br>our esteemed emeritus professors and of<br>course our ringaweta extraordinaire<br>shafali who managed to organize all of<br>this<br>and produce a video which you'll see<br>later and she doesn't look flustered at<br>all i don't know how she quite pulls<br>that off<br>my whanau from ngati cheepa wonderful to<br>see you here whanau from tudungawaiwai<br>as well<br>dr ngahuia dixon actually worked<br>previously here at this university and i<br>remember very clearly when i gave my job<br>talk to get my position when i first<br>started at nydia in 2010 after i gave my<br>talk i was very nervous and she stood up<br>and said something like if you don't<br>so kamua kaamuri this is i'm not sure<br>why this isn't this isn't turning up but<br>i've got this beautiful picture that<br>sits in the background actually of my<br>whanau and ngati tipa that i'm doing<br>research with on amazon grant outside<br>our fari i'm not quite sure why it's<br>there but hopefully the rest of my<br>slides will turn up later on<br>but today i really just wanted to take<br>this opportunity since we're amongst<br>colleagues friends and whanau to reflect<br>on this theme of kam ka muri kamua<br>kamuri<br>sometimes this is interpreted as as<br>walking backwards into the future<br>or that we should look to the past<br>to inform our future<br>from a western perspective the past<br>tends to be seen as is behind us<br>and one's goals and aspirations relate<br>to the future<br>which is ahead of us<br>from a maori worldview the past and the<br>present are knowable<br>the words used to describe the past<br>literally means the time in front of us<br>so we do not leave the past behind<br>rather we carry our past with us into<br>the future<br>and when we as maori talk about the<br>future we invariably talk about our<br>relationships with our mokopuna<br>wakatu incorporation for those of you<br>who are purveyors of fine wine and like<br>to drink tofu wine wakatu owns tohu wine<br>they're a wholly maori owned corporation<br>one of the largest land holders into<br>taywahu and nelson<br>so they have a 500 year plan<br>that is not the average business plan<br>called<br>so when they're talking about their<br>mokopuna they're talking about their udi<br>their descendants yet to come<br>and that's the vision the long vision<br>that i think we need here in aotearoa<br>so it is this dynamic interplay of the<br>past the present and the future that<br>means we can talk<br>simultaneously and unproblematically<br>about the ancestors that we carry with<br>us and the mukapuna that are yet to be<br>born<br>2100 seems too far away for some<br>you go too far out and the data gets<br>dodgy<br>are there any population projections<br>people hear from stats it must be a few<br>kim dunstan<br>somewhere<br>so demographers like precise models<br>and the reduction of uncertainty or the<br>quantification of uncertainty<br>and going too far out in the future<br>becomes too blurry<br>but we cannot and we must not be<br>contained by our models<br>by focusing on the immediate and even<br>the intermediate we can forget to turn<br>our attention towards the long-term<br>economic and demographic challenges that<br>we surely must face<br>if we want a land for our<br>and 2100 my youngest will be nine my<br>oldest will be 92.<br>that seems so old<br>and my youngest will be 86 and i did go<br>and check the period life tables and who<br>expected uh life expectancy at age zero<br>it was 77 years so<br>i'm rooting for her<br>they will likely have mokopuna perhaps<br>great mokopuna and when i think of these<br>mukuls mukuls the questions that arise<br>are<br>not how many people will live in<br>hamilton in five years time<br>or what would the ethnic composition<br>look like in 10 years time are these all<br>i'm not minimizing these questions they<br>are very important for planning and<br>other purposes and decision making<br>but when i think of the long juror the<br>question i ask is what is a legacy that<br>we wish to live to wish to leave<br>what do we want for our mokopunis<br>here in this place in aotearoa so i want<br>to reflect a little bit on what it means<br>to carry our past into the future<br>from the specific standpoint of an<br>indigenous demographer in this land<br>and in some ways i can't think of a<br>better time to do this in a post-covered<br>context we've been through a rough year<br>more than 2.6 million people globally<br>have died<br>many have lost their livelihoods<br>the economists will like this working<br>hour losses well it's not good news but<br>it's precise news working hour losses in<br>2020 were approximately four times<br>greater<br>during the pandemic in 2020 than during<br>the global financial crisis in 2009<br>the pandemic has laid bare inequalities<br>that we cannot and must not ignore<br>there is an appetite for change of some<br>have dubbed it the great reset<br>to recover from covert 19 to build<br>healthier more equitable more prosperous<br>futures<br>to be greener to be smarter to be fairer<br>i'm sure you've all heard some of these<br>mantras along the line in the last year<br>the united nations of course has the<br>sustainable development goals i'm sure<br>someone will talk about them at some<br>stage during the day<br>and recently supercharged these with its<br>call for urgent solutions for urgent<br>times focusing on climate change poverty<br>justice human rights and gender equality<br>here in aotearoa we know we're lucky<br>we're fed much better than other<br>countries in terms of the direct effects<br>of the pandemic<br>but we know that the economic effects<br>have been far from even<br>for far too many new zealanders<br>nothing could be worse than a return to<br>normality<br>so in these times it's important i think<br>to have a population lens and a long<br>lens<br>and i feel privileged that i can be part<br>of nydia as the country's only<br>population institute<br>that can provide a sort of leadership to<br>surface conversations about our<br>population futures and have those high<br>conversations<br>it's important too to have a population<br>lens that is interconnected to not just<br>focus on the local but to be able to<br>situate that in the global<br>we are at a critical inflection point<br>for people in for planet<br>by 2100 we will see the end of global<br>growth<br>by 2075 the number of older people aged<br>65 years and older will outnumber<br>children for the first time this is<br>globally<br>oh that shows up that's great<br>so you can see in these graphs that<br>project out to 2100<br>by the united nations desert these are<br>the most recent world population<br>projections and the median rate<br>projections just over one-fifth of the<br>world's population<br>will be aged 22 on the right hand side<br>age 65 years and older by the turn of<br>the century<br>and children will comprise around 18<br>so that transition<br>from more older people than younger<br>people will happen before the end of the<br>century<br>world population will continue to grow<br>significantly but the vast majority of<br>that growth over 90 percent will be<br>concentrated in the countries and groups<br>that currently have much lower levels of<br>income and access to resources<br>the 21st century will mark the end of<br>the<br>the demographic transition the process<br>by which populations move from high<br>fertility higher mortality and stable<br>population through to low mortality low<br>for utility and stable population<br>and when this happens as it's theorized<br>to do around 2100 global growth will<br>stabilize and then decline<br>this trend will hit the most developed<br>countries first of course if natalie<br>dick and ian have written about<br>extensively it's already happened in<br>many countries<br>um<br>and and will happen later for those<br>countries that are less economically<br>developed there will be tremendous<br>cross-national and regional variation<br>there is no<br>one-size-fits-all policy response to<br>this<br>so while we need to be have an eye to<br>the global uh to the global trends we<br>also need to have granular<br>um in deep knowledge about what is<br>happening in our land<br>there will be complex interactions and<br>tensions between population planet and<br>resources<br>that we must grapple with<br>and if the covert has taught us anything<br>is that<br>that we have to deal with<br>we may be able to lock down our borders<br>temporarily but we can't unplug from the<br>global economy<br>so what does this mean for aotearoa<br>in recent years there's been a narrative<br>about unprecedented unprecedented<br>disruption<br>and in some ways this is true but in<br>other ways it couldn't be further from<br>the truth<br>as i learned from an our nydia emeritus<br>professor<br>ian paul in 1997 i think when i took<br>that pops 201 as an undergraduate here<br>at waikato university<br>our population size but especially our<br>structure<br>is the product of past dynamics and past<br>transitions<br>we always<br>carry our past with us<br>transitions and fertility mortality and<br>migration that underpin the aotearoa now<br>had their genesis and changes decades<br>ago and much longer than that for the<br>pakia population<br>sub-replacement fertility and high rates<br>of net migration<br>these are not new these didn't just<br>happen<br>the concept of age structural<br>transitions<br>which ian has studied and depth is<br>fundamental as he has shown in key<br>publications population age structures<br>almost always display a complex and<br>time-varying pattern producing age waves<br>that have policy implications that<br>defies a one-size-fits-all approach i<br>like this quote demography will matter<br>in the century not by force of numbers<br>but by the pressures of waves of age<br>structural change<br>shout out to all the demographers in the<br>room<br>but i don't want to lose the other<br>people who are here so i'm not going to<br>talk about too much demography that's<br>not the point of this talk<br>over the last decade natalie jackson's<br>important work on sub-national<br>population change has shown that the<br>onset of depopulation begins<br>sub-nationally<br>and the places where we live<br>her work has unpacked a new form of<br>sub-national depopulation<br>to populate depopulation arising from<br>net migration loss and natural and<br>decrease in tandem<br>and she has shown that age selective<br>migration is causing many areas to age<br>far more rapidly than they would from<br>the demographic transition alone<br>natalie's important work on the maori<br>demographic dividend has also shown that<br>young maori and pacific peoples<br>will play an increasing role in<br>determining aotearoa's economic future<br>and that a far greater level of<br>attention<br>needs to be an investment needs to be<br>forthcoming in the education training<br>health and well-being<br>but that demographic grace period<br>is closing<br>and to a large extent has been wasted<br>and it's really maori driven initiatives<br>like pujor stem academy<br>which develop an indigenous centred<br>approach to supporting maori kids into<br>stem-related fields<br>and naitahu's tokunataraki the maori<br>futures collective initiative in the<br>south island<br>these are the ones these are the models<br>that are really offering new models for<br>change<br>now i just want to um talk a little bit<br>here about<br>oops let me just stay here for a little<br>bit i don't want to i don't want to move<br>too quickly um<br>about demographic transitions and here<br>in aotearoa<br>the transitions we've had here been very<br>very different for maori and pakia<br>populations<br>differences in the timing and the<br>drivers and the pace of change we know<br>for example there was no such thing as a<br>maori baby boom<br>maori still had high fertility<br>the baby boom was a peculiar pakia<br>experience here in aotearoa when maori<br>fertility did decline<br>it happened quite late and it was<br>spectacularly rapid one of the most<br>rapid observed of any population up to<br>that point in the world<br>and even now our futility remains higher<br>than pakia just above replacement but<br>with the younger age patterning as moana<br>already is showing a new phd thesis<br>around maori futility<br>other indigenous peoples have had<br>similar transitions<br>indeed one might argue that there's<br>something distinctive to indigenous<br>peoples demographic transitions which is<br>obscured in mainstream demographic<br>theory<br>so demographers and sociologists ask we<br>have talked about an ethnic transition<br>which is a product of prior demographic<br>transitions associated with changes in<br>fertility mortality marriage family<br>longevity and aging patterns<br>and today we see the different growth<br>patterns and different age structures in<br>our different ethnic populations in 2018<br>the median age the age at which you have<br>half the population older and half the<br>population younger for the european<br>population was 41 years<br>for maori and pacific peoples it was<br>much younger at 25 and 23 years<br>respectively<br>for asian and middle east and latin<br>american african<br>mila<br>category<br>crazy me like category<br>um that contains so many different<br>peoples within it<br>nevertheless for those groups the median<br>age was 31 years<br>by 2038 the european share in aotearoa<br>will drop to<br>66<br>just over two thirds<br>the lowest since colonization<br>science are now um and his collaborators<br>in the states have referred to this<br>ethnic transition as<br>fundamentally the interaction between<br>demography and resources<br>where those situated at the lower rungs<br>of stratification have lower<br>socioeconomic resources and this is<br>associated with higher fertility and<br>shorter life expectancies<br>they say that we need a critical<br>demography to understand the underlying<br>dynamics<br>that generate the reproduction of racism<br>stratification and inequality<br>in colonial settler states like aotearoa<br>the role of history<br>historical colonisation<br>in ongoing colonialism<br>are important factors<br>and understanding the dynamics between<br>stratification and demography<br>in this country<br>in fact they are more than important<br>factors they are the underlying drivers<br>of the drivers<br>and having undertaken a research project<br>that was funded by the swedish research<br>council that looks at the role of<br>colonisation and population research and<br>having done a semi-systematic review of<br>the literature<br>i can say empirically that colonialism<br>very rarely figures as a central<br>explanation in the demography of<br>indigenous peoples<br>rather it is evaluated relegated to a<br>background variable at best<br>and i can understand why the c word is<br>not a popular one in demography it's<br>shifty and precise contentious<br>an inconvenient reminder of the past<br>but worse it's really hard to<br>operationalize in a statistical model<br>but without it<br>neither the very different transitions<br>that maori have had<br>nor the current situation and structural<br>arrangements of stratification and<br>inequality<br>without it<br>they make no sense<br>so if we are to carry our past into the<br>future with us<br>we can't conveniently expunge that from<br>our conceptual frames and statistical<br>models we must put them in the centre<br>and this isn't just about maori it's<br>about all of us<br>in some ways it's superficial to think<br>that changing demographics will<br>necessarily lead to a change in power<br>arrangements<br>the sociologists many decades ago<br>blaylock argued that the growth of<br>minority populations<br>threatened the power and the privilege<br>of the dominant white population in the<br>context of the united states<br>and he also argued<br>that the result of that was that the<br>dominant population set in motion a<br>variety of policies and practices<br>designed to limit<br>the political power and economic<br>possibilities of minority groups<br>so that while<br>in 2075 in the united states and even<br>even even earlier<br>the dominant white group will become a<br>numerical minority they will still<br>maintain their dominant and advantaged<br>position<br>now<br>two years on from the christchurch<br>the narratives that we tell ourselves as<br>a country are important<br>and there is a narrative<br>that<br>racism is on the fringes<br>that it dwells on the periphery and it's<br>not<br>at the center of who we are as a<br>colonial settler state<br>i have learnt much on this topic from<br>the critical lens of my colleague dr<br>aramara who'll be talking later on in<br>the panel<br>and some of the work that we've tried to<br>do to understand what's going on at the<br>centre and not just on the periphery has<br>involved looking at some of the<br>population<br>survey data from the new zealand general<br>social survey<br>some of you may have seen this slide<br>before and i just want to show a couple<br>of it we have we have many more but i<br>just want to pick out a couple<br>and this is a question from the nzgss<br>from 2016 to ask how important is<br>diversity and multiculturalism in<br>defining new zealand<br>and how important is maori culture in<br>defining new zealand and then if we look<br>at the distributions by ethnic group we<br>see a really interesting pattern so if<br>you look first ethnic differences in the<br>importance of multiculturalism and<br>ethnic diversity we see here very very<br>high proportion of pacific and asian<br>people in the survey nearly 90 percent<br>felt that<br>multiculturalism is very important for<br>new zealand<br>maori is reasonably high at 79 percent<br>but the group that sees that is at least<br>inclined to see<br>multiculturalism as being important for<br>defining who we are as a country<br>now if we tuned into maori culture and<br>ethnic differences in the proportion<br>that believe maori culture is very<br>important for defining who we are as a<br>country we see that maori of course yes<br>90 percent of maori think maori culture<br>is very important for defining aotearoa<br>pacific peoples 82<br>asian peoples majority of who are<br>overseas born 76<br>but again<br>the lowest proportion who see maori<br>culture as significant for our country<br>is the european population<br>now this is you know nationally<br>representative data<br>this is not<br>a poll that's just taken by<br>our lunchroom<br>and students<br>so we can generalize from this to say<br>that it's actually tapping something<br>that's real and there's a number of<br>other results from different surveys and<br>studies that we've done<br>that will support this<br>so<br>and the remaining time that i have left<br>i just want to leave that and i think<br>we'll pick up on this thing later on in<br>our migration panel but in the remaining<br>time that i have left i just want to<br>return to the main theme of our<br>ancestors<br>in our mokopuna and tell the story of<br>our ancestors and our mokopuna through<br>the lens of the past and the prison<br>and we all start here is with tipa<br>tipura as our eponymous ancestor of our<br>hapu ngati tipa<br>um<br>sometimes people don't really understand<br>that these are real people that lived<br>we've been constructing our<br>whakapapa and our hapu through our<br>marsden project and and once you<br>reconstruct your whakapapa back to your<br>eponymous ancestor it all becomes very<br>real and so tipa lived around 1650 and<br>had linkages to<br>many other hapu and the waikato<br>come from that is their eponymous<br>ancestor to pikiao and tiarawa<br>to ngati pawa who now reside in haudaki<br>to tamatera and marutuahu so thomas some<br>of the important whakapapa genealogical<br>relationships<br>that link ngati tipa to other hapu and<br>ewi<br>so we are ngati tipa if you follow the<br>this is from an old 19th century map if<br>you follow the waikato awa<br>through hamilton<br>up around the bend moosa<br>and it runs out to the tasman sea<br>that is being ati tipura<br>where the tasman with the wakato awa<br>i came across this picture in one of our<br>wananga whakapapa<br>a couple of years ago i've never seen it<br>before that i'm not sure if you can see<br>the names underneath it but the names<br>i had<br>actually never heard of of these tupuna<br>but they were my my grandfathers my<br>their great great great grandfather<br>kukutai<br>signed the territory of waitangi on<br>behalf of ngati tipa<br>and<br>after the invasion<br>of the waikato and the confiscation of<br>waikato lands ngati tipa received 45 000<br>acres back<br>through the compensation court and that<br>now<br>at that time nawairo and tahu were<br>living on the urpuatia block with my<br>great-grandparents<br>and my grandfather who was yet to come<br>so i just want to<br>hold that image of of tahirangaweiro<br>there<br>they were born in the early 1900s<br>and ian's seminal book te iwi maori he<br>estimates that life expectation at birth<br>for maori at the turn of the century was<br>for parking it was almost double<br>indeed as woodward and blakely have<br>shown in their book a healthy country<br>between 1870 and 1940 pakia enjoyed the<br>lowest mortality<br>in the world<br>this wasn't the case for my tupuna and<br>my namesake<br>they died as young girls in 1914.<br>i found a newspaper article<br>of their father my great-grandfather<br>giving testimony in a court and what had<br>happened is they become very very ill<br>and he had sought the help and<br>intervention of a pakia an english<br>retired midwife who lived in<br>te puaha among singapore people and she<br>had provided her with sort of remedies<br>which were later found to be<br>stuff that she just mixed up<br>but she was doing this and she was<br>charging maori in the area<br>quite significant fees because they were<br>desperate and they wanted to save their<br>children<br>so<br>tahu and ngawairu died and there are<br>many greys of young<br>children in our urupa up at te kwahanga<br>and the midwife was charged and<br>so<br>in terms of carrying the past<br>with us<br>and looking back to the the spanish<br>influenza<br>in 1918<br>the death rates for maori were seven<br>times higher than for pakia<br>the devastation in this part of the<br>country was immense and partly led to<br>tipu moving to tujanga waiaway and<br>ngaruwahi and founding a new community<br>there<br>but there was a lot going on with the<br>land as well it wasn't just the people<br>and i just want to read a letter that<br>was written<br>by my great great grandfather's cousin<br>in 1895 to the herald<br>at that time the urputia block was<br>intact<br>it had been<br>allocated to ngati tipa in 1868<br>and through various means they had<br>managed to keep it intact for nearly 30<br>years<br>so in this letter to the herald my<br>tupuna writes<br>this is my question to you<br>can the government break the law<br>we native owners of all puertier have<br>found europeans who agree to leave out<br>who agree to lease our land and the rent<br>and all agreements have been arranged<br>between us and these pakia<br>we have chosen our committee<br>and waited now a long time to give<br>effect to the lease the law says we are<br>to form a committee and the committee<br>has assigned the lease we wish to deal<br>with our land according to the law but<br>the minister of land says no he won't<br>agree to private dealings<br>now this is my question<br>is the minister stronger than the law<br>we maori always thought ministers were<br>appointed to carry out the law<br>we hear a great talk of their wanting to<br>settle people on the land but it is all<br>gammon<br>i didn't know that word existed then<br>um<br>we can put 150 settlers on our land or<br>puertia in a few weeks if they will let<br>us but the government blocked the way<br>like a great stone in the road<br>and they say<br>you maoris must sell your land for five<br>shillings an acre<br>land which is worth two dollars an acre<br>and more<br>they will give us the five shillings an<br>acre but give pakiha and the other<br>island<br>five pounds to ten pounds an acre<br>and yet they talk of one law for both<br>races<br>let there be one law for both races<br>and let the minister obey the law<br>why should he seek to stop us by idle<br>talk when he has no more power to do so<br>than he has to stop your parque is<br>leasing your lands<br>sufficient<br>i like that ending<br>there's a few emails where i think i<br>no<br>so the work that one of our phd nydia<br>phd graduates jc whitehead has done for<br>us linking up our 19th century<br>historical maps<br>and land titles from london's basically<br>a massive exercise and<br>whakapapa and finoa data repatriation<br>linkage and interpretation<br>this is very suspenseful<br>i can see it on my screen but you can't<br>well it's really frustrating<br>i don't think it's going to work someone<br>up here will come and come up here and<br>do it i'll have to describe it for you<br>basically what it shows is<br>a map of ah<br>do you want to stay there thank you<br>my magic helper<br>this is the map that uh that jesse<br>recreated of the original oputia block<br>the forty five thousand acres owned<br>waiangati tipu<br>um and he's by he's shown the amount of<br>land alienation by decade<br>and<br>the dark the dark red shows alienation<br>from the 1890s and as it gets lighter it<br>goes through the decades<br>but there's really two key points here<br>and the first key point is the dark red<br>represents alienation in the 1890s so my<br>2.0 was writing this letter in 1895<br>mass alienation began in 1896.<br>by the end of the 1990s two-thirds of<br>the urputia block had been alienated<br>in one case it was 17 000 acres went<br>the blue the second key point of this is<br>the blue the blue is what we currently<br>have<br>it's five percent<br>of the all-pure tier block<br>so despite living on the land<br>despite planning for the land<br>despite appeals to even-handedness<br>from the politician politicians of the<br>day<br>despite<br>uh<br>strong attempts to retain manomuchu<br>over our land<br>now i want to fast forward and i'm<br>oh no i don't know where the next<br>slide's gone yeah let's just disregard<br>that<br>what i wanted to do was fast forward to<br>tahu in the prison<br>and i had this really nice photo<br>of me and my cousin my tuakana ngawairo<br>and we're in our family house in<br>turangawa that our grandfather had built<br>because our great grandparents left<br>their homes what land they had left in<br>orputia<br>and they came with te puya<br>to establish tuaranga huawei in the wake<br>of influenza that had decimated our<br>people<br>she needed workers<br>this wasn't welcomed by pakeha in the<br>township<br>as wayangahuya knows they rallied<br>against the purya's plan to revive the<br>kingitanga and make a new home in<br>i was born in wellington my dad was born<br>in tujunga marai but he moved to<br>wellington along with many others who<br>migrated to the towns and cities<br>i was part of the generation x<br>born in urban area<br>at that time the life expectancy of a<br>maori girl born in 1971 yes that's how<br>old i am 50 soon<br>had a life expectancy of 65 years<br>compared to a non-maori baby girl my<br>neighbor<br>75 years<br>she had a 10 year start on me so i had<br>to learn to run fast<br>i was one of two maori in the school<br>i wasn't able to speak the deal because<br>my father a native speaker was beaten<br>for doing so at school<br>we've got a photo on our photo album of<br>the 1975 land march that was started by<br>fino cooper<br>and it ended in wellington and there's a<br>photo of my dad there with my brother<br>perched on his shoulders he wasn't going<br>to miss him<br>in 1980 we returned to ngaru obahi at<br>the tudungaway to the place<br>to our home and what in a way it was<br>inevitable the return<br>i went to school on the town side<br>there's two sides in ottawa here the<br>town side and the pass side<br>my whakapapa was on the par side but i<br>went to school in the town side<br>half of the school was maori but there<br>was no single maori teacher just a<br>dental nurse<br>she was terrifying<br>my new best friend had a two-story home<br>with three toilets and a pool<br>and my nine-year-old self tried to<br>process<br>process this against the reality of my<br>grand aunt's fare on the papakainga at<br>tudongawawai which still had a long<br>in 1980<br>and we used a tin bath to bathe on the<br>patio<br>and hope that the the joseph boys up the<br>up the hill didn't walk past when you<br>were having a bath<br>so<br>that was tahu in the prison and if i<br>think about tahu in the future<br>2100 i like to imagine maybe it's a<br>holograph<br>of a mokopuna mokopuna holding a picture<br>of tahu and ngawado holding a picture of<br>tahungawairo<br>who knows with artificial intelligence<br>anything's possible<br>there's a lot of uncertainty but what we<br>do know about our population futures<br>here in aotearoa<br>is that we will be older<br>we will be more<br>with diverse<br>end of growth we probably will be fewer<br>we know that with our whenua there are<br>massive challenges climate changes with<br>global warming rising sea levels more<br>frequent droughts and floods<br>the technology and digital revolution is<br>already upon us intruding into our lives<br>in granular detail real-time mass<br>surveillance the legal settings have not<br>caught up<br>the ability to opt out of digital<br>technologies networks tracing<br>surveillance and databases as hard<br>there's a lot of talk about<br>adaptation to what is coming and francis<br>is right demography<br>is not destiny<br>we must adapt<br>but we must not accept that<br>which is patently wrong<br>and we must push back against the<br>discourse<br>of demography as destiny<br>inequality is destiny<br>climate devastation is destiny<br>living lightly living smartly living<br>distinctively living well with dignity<br>and opportunity<br>that is the<br>fenua<br>that i want for my mokopuna<br>in 2100<br>kyoto</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
