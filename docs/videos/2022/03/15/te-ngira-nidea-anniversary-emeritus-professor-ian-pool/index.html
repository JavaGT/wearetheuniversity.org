until<br>it became nidia had endured for 30 years<br>this was more than one third of my life<br>and half my working life<br>this longevity raises major themes which<br>fit well with the nydia seminars overall<br>title<br>so the question is<br>why was the population study centre<br>able to be sustained in this way<br>what were the factors that drove its<br>success<br>in fact its existence was longer than<br>this<br>in the 1970s ted douglas ruth farmer and<br>james o'neill<br>all ran demography courses in their core<br>departments<br>moreover ruth farmer had set up a<br>population<br>unit in geography<br>also using parts of that department<br>library grant to buy key books and<br>journals and demography and she did a<br>very good job<br>douglas farmer o'neil strongly<br>encouraged me to return to new zealand<br>from canada to strengthen demography at<br>that at waikato<br>in the event<br>in 1978<br>the university appointed me professor of<br>sociology<br>but not of demography has had been hoped<br>in general in fact the commitment of the<br>university to population studies was<br>slow to materialize<br>it took until 1980 before the population<br>study centre was formally instituted and<br>then with parsimonious constraints<br>imposed in particular on funding<br>nevertheless the population studies<br>center and success in nydia were<br>and continue to be<br>new zealand's only such center<br>before returning to new zealand i had<br>benefited from teaching and research<br>experiences in major overseas centres<br>and reviewing population development<br>agencies especially in french west<br>africa<br>this knowledge which i had brought back<br>to new zealand shaped my view about the<br>ethos of a center<br>and helped me to analyze maori<br>historical data<br>these experiences have shown me that<br>when establishing a new entity<br>there are essentially two paths<br>available<br>set about institution building<br>or<br>set about producing project outputs<br>although of course the two approaches<br>are not diametrically opposed<br>institution building<br>emphasizes infrastructure branding<br>facilities mission statements and so on<br>by contrast project orientation demands<br>investment of most available funds into<br>research analysis<br>we chose the latter approach<br>at a theoretical level the population<br>studies center approach has a papa back<br>to the actual<br>founding of the royal society<br>in 1662 the bills of mortality a sort of<br>primitive life table<br>in north america and australia we tend<br>to see population issues as driven by<br>migration<br>yet mortality is the real heart of<br>demography<br>it drove global growth until the 19th<br>century<br>since when globally<br>improved survivorship<br>has been associated with a long-term<br>worldwide fertility decline<br>starting in the anglo settler colonies<br>as it happens<br>migration is a minor component of growth<br>far outrun by natural increase in most<br>quinquinia<br>yet<br>it's marked spikes and churning<br>now perturbed the entire demographic<br>system and render analysis problematic<br>across comparative analysis on the anglo<br>settler states and my forthcoming book<br>peopling and development in a settler<br>society rt aurora 1769 to 2020<br>demonstrates that this holds true<br>also for the other anglo-satura colonies<br>the analysis of mortality<br>has bequeathed to demography basic<br>concepts such as cohorts and<br>survivorship<br>and has been a general factor in theory<br>building particularly in mathematical<br>demography<br>this methodology is very different from<br>the regression-based techniques which<br>dominate in the other social sciences<br>thus<br>lifetable analysis must be a core course<br>for any student of demography<br>we also decided to focus on social<br>rather than technical and demography<br>this was reinforced by the appointment<br>in 1995 to the population study center<br>of two senior staff arunachalam dharma<br>lingam and sarah hillcote nala tombi<br>in the late 1990s senator baxter dean<br>was employed as a fellow and worked<br>there for about a decade<br>richard bedford natalie jackson and jack<br>pote were directors for varying periods<br>and others were appointed acting<br>directors of the center<br>bethahu kukatai<br>bedford jackson and boat contributed to<br>prestigious research and center<br>management thus enhancing its reputation<br>the projects brought in<br>research fellows<br>mainly graduate students too many to<br>list here from a number of disciplines<br>with a fair number from overseas<br>now over the 30 years<br>the population study center initiated<br>and successfully completed<br>five major tranches of projects which<br>i'll describe briefly to indicate the<br>strength and breadth of population<br>studies and activities<br>all<br>tranches involve numerous researchers<br>and we publish collectively typically<br>with different lead authors<br>numerous smaller projects were also<br>activated and the senior faculty have<br>all written major analyses that brought<br>prestige to the population study center<br>the international seminar on stochastic<br>projections published an edited<br>monograph and a special edition of the<br>new zealand population review and<br>michael cameron has extended this work<br>as senior author dharma lingam published<br>a monograph on birth and liberal<br>dynamics<br>sierra hilko nalatambi published a<br>monograph on contraception and mauritius<br>at the hundredth uh anniversary of women<br>gaining the vote in aotearoa<br>we published ministry of women and what<br>is still<br>a unique book<br>authored by leafa de lisa davies and<br>peer-reviewed by prove hyman<br>on the history of women's labor force<br>participation from 1893 to 1993.<br>turning to major branches the 1980s were<br>given over to the united nations<br>economic and social country monograph<br>series on each specific country<br>and this new zealand was partially<br>funded by the population division of the<br>economic and social commission for asia<br>and the pacific<br>and partly by ad hoc means<br>among participating countries published<br>two volumes and was unique in having<br>little public financial support the<br>australian volume for example was<br>supported by the commonwealth of<br>australia<br>these two rtr raw volumes remain the<br>most comprehensive overview of new<br>zealand population and encompass an<br>extraordinary wide range<br>of topics for example law and population<br>by sylvia cartwright an environment by<br>charles crothers<br>ruth farmer's long chapter<br>on migration received plaudits from<br>kingsley davis the internationally<br>eminent social demographer<br>the 1990s were devoted to a fertility<br>survey new zealand's only proportional<br>probability survey fuel in this field<br>it had clip-ons based on<br>disproportionate segments<br>this allowed over-sampling of maori<br>and of funded from tippuni corkery<br>and of residents the midland regional<br>health authority<br>funded by that rha which made available<br>other services grants and jobs<br>it yielded data on the missing elements<br>of fertility research birth interval<br>dynamics such as contraceptive use<br>and true cohort analysis<br>alone among the countries we extended<br>the scope of the study designed by five<br>years thus being able to cop<br>comment on earlier pre-pill barrier<br>stages of the contraceptive revolution<br>we used the over sample to extend the<br>number of respondents<br>but moving between the simple<br>proportionate sample and the over sample<br>involved complex waiting<br>i had the opportunity to discuss all<br>this with ian diamond a bud companion of<br>len cooks<br>a leading statistician demographer who<br>was also familiar with new zealand<br>the funding of the survey was haphazard<br>beyond the grants noted already<br>michael solby vice chancellor<br>made available some seating funds<br>they were insufficient to support a<br>project but i felt they might<br>make up<br>the start of such funding<br>but good fortune was at hand<br>we'd become associate members of the<br>co-terminus united nations european<br>commission's<br>multi-cultural study<br>for curious united nations region<br>canada is a member of that commission<br>but more importantly<br>we had access to the european court<br>commission's questionnaires<br>methodologies and published one of their<br>country reports with kim johnson as<br>leader author<br>moreover the following world fertility<br>survey protocols<br>we had set up a policy council to<br>provide community inputs<br>to major practices and the progress<br>and this was chaired by jocelyn fish<br>formerly president of new zealand<br>council of women<br>she went ahead and arranged a meeting<br>with the then minister of women's<br>affairs on of health<br>it finished with the minister asking our<br>dean<br>peggy cooper boyden how much money was<br>needed<br>minister shipley then turned to<br>officials and with not a single caveat<br>told them to give us the funding as<br>requested<br>this survey was highly productive<br>producing countless papers theses<br>reports several monographs and a long<br>co-authored book on the family<br>demography of arturo by paul dharma<br>lingam and janet skeets<br>now since publishing an early paper in<br>1963<br>on winners of mario maori i'd worried<br>about the effects of intermarriage on<br>ethnic classification<br>we used the census question with a<br>follow-up if you have two or more<br>ethnicities to which of these would you<br>accord priority<br>tahu kukatai<br>and analyzed these results and launched<br>a much wider global<br>study on related topics<br>the project in the late 1990s was<br>somewhat out of sight in new zealand as<br>it came through an iusp technical<br>committee under sri pad tuljapurka<br>the contribution of the psc<br>was to edit two books<br>and write a number of<br>papers<br>particularly on the issue of disordered<br>cohort effects and their policy<br>implications<br>migration flows incidentally are very<br>subject to disordered effects making<br>problematic planning analyses that<br>integrate migration data<br>project 304 in the early 2000s attempted<br>to address a a very important question<br>the links between mortality and<br>morbidity<br>this topic was gaining importance in new<br>zealand and overseas and at a high<br>academic level<br>think of joseph stiglitz and angus<br>deaton<br>who see health as central to all<br>development<br>and not just a demand side variable it<br>had formulated a new<br>methodology<br>health expectancies this was applied by<br>martin tobias and others in the ministry<br>of health to new zealand data and then<br>to a true new zealand cohort the<br>significantly standard host<br>understanding of mortality morbidity<br>relations<br>with jit cheng we formulate an extension<br>of health expectancies which we call<br>hospitalization<br>hospital utilization expectancies based<br>on discharge data<br>they are based on point prevalence of<br>day stay data<br>now conventionally health economics is<br>based on monetized data often converted<br>but a brief reflection would show that<br>monetized data are highly volatile and<br>unreliable no adjustments can really<br>ultimately overcome these problems<br>by contrast a day's stay in hospital is<br>a much more stable material<br>variable but whether hospitalization<br>took the form of the 1919<br>flu or covert 19 a bed is a bed a meal<br>is a meal etc<br>whereas dollar varies vary<br>values vary<br>this project's main contribution<br>was for gary jackson and me to present a<br>paper on it at every north island<br>teaching hospital and the ministry of<br>health the project also published a<br>monograph and several papers<br>the final project owes its success and<br>productivity to sandra maxson dean<br>she carried out a statistical analysis<br>and wrote up the results of regional<br>differences in population<br>both for<br>demographic<br>measures<br>and for<br>and for other factors such as social<br>welfare<br>no monograph has been derived from this<br>although ko bexandin co-authored 12<br>discussion papers so the results are on<br>public record<br>more importantly she dissected every<br>single variable census or other for<br>looking for problems<br>these analyses should be required<br>reading for everyone using these data<br>i quote from her results widely in my<br>recently completed book<br>i finished my presentation<br>by previewing a successful future<br>vanilla<br>if this commentary has any central<br>message it is a project orientation or<br>strength and production production is<br>the best way to enhance the profile of<br>lydia nationally and internationally as<br>the only academic population center in<br>new zealand<br>i look forward to nydia being the go-to<br>center<br>for<br>people explaining about demographic<br>issues<br>finally<br>we are a multicultural society<br>it is nydia's duty to ensure that the<br>contribution of each main culture<br>receives recognition about its<br>contribution<br>to the peopling and development of rt</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
