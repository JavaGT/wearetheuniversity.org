we<br>welcome you from wherever you have come<br>from<br>and from whichever backgrounds that you<br>have<br>we acknowledge king two heights here<br>uh correctly is<br>in this place that we are in<br>and also especially ngati hawaii and<br>the original inhabitants of this area<br>where the university stands today<br>and we also especially acknowledge um<br>the tomi kudo of our first maori king<br>potato fedorfido<br>um his tomi kudo that he left us and<br>there's there's another symbol at the<br>university of this<br>which is up by the um the library<br>a sculpture that was done<br>but it talks about<br>um<br>the mafiro<br>the leaders the mapang those who have to<br>work<br>and at their time<br>ma which is the<br>the pakia<br>in the maori traditional lifestyle and<br>he was looking forward<br>and what he was saying we're all going<br>to have to come through the eye of the<br>needle combine<br>what we have learned<br>looking forward into the society which<br>it's a common vision it not only<br>requires collaboration but also the best<br>learnings practices<br>and especially relevant to nidhiya<br>and its 10 years having the best<br>information available to make decisions<br>for the future<br>and this has been the heart of the mahi<br>pleasure to introduce<br>the director of nidia professor francis<br>collins<br>welcome everyone to the university of<br>waikato and the 10th anniversary of<br>terunanga tatari tataranga the national<br>institute of demographic and economic<br>analysis or nydia as it has become<br>affectionately known or as it become<br>known by those of us who struggle with<br>20 syllables<br>my name is francis collins and i'm the<br>direct current director of nydia a role<br>that i feel very privileged and honoured<br>to have and also overall at times not<br>least given the imminent researchers i<br>work amongst who are here today and<br>those who have come before me in this<br>role at nydia and in population studies<br>at the university of waikato more<br>generally<br>now this morning i'm going to offer some<br>opening comments on nidia and thanks and<br>acknowledgements as well but before i<br>continue just some basic housekeeping<br>matters need to be addressed the toilets<br>can be found outside the theater just to<br>the left<br>and the unlikely event of an emergency<br>uh we ask that you please exit through<br>the side doors you might see the center<br>door there that is closed and remain<br>closed but exit through the side doors<br>to the left and right of the theater and<br>exit onto the lake and then there's a<br>paved area just to the right of the<br>academy we will gather<br>please do also sign in with the cover<br>tracer app there is a qr code available<br>in the lobby you might have seen it if<br>you haven't already and wi-fi is<br>available here in this room there's ids<br>and passwords on the table<br>now should you need anything else um you<br>can come and see me or any of the other<br>nydia staff and students we all have the<br>blue name tags on uh to identify us and<br>we'd all be very happy to answer any<br>questions you have or to direct you to<br>someone who can<br>now there are many people who need to be<br>thanked in relation to this event before<br>we get going thank you already to veto<br>for opening us up so well uh with the<br>mihi fakata and speaking to the ways in<br>which nidia and indeed the importance of<br>population research and bringing<br>different strands together and thinking<br>about how we create different kinds of<br>futures<br>i would like to give special thanks to<br>shefali pawa who many of you will know<br>if you've been involved with nydia over<br>the years in addition to being an<br>excellent senior research officer<br>shefali has led the organisation of this<br>anniversary and put an enormous amount<br>of work into it and i really appreciate<br>what she's done here and what she's been<br>able to bring together<br>i'd like to thank all the university of<br>waikato staff who are able to be here<br>today and of course our visitors here<br>from here in kirikariro hamilton the<br>waida waikato region auckland wellington<br>and and elsewhere as well<br>thank you for joining us here today<br>it's also a pleasure and honor to have<br>with us today all for um<br>all four nidia emeritus professors ian<br>paul dan piggy koopman boydman richard<br>bedford and jacques poot as well as dr<br>natalie jackson the founding director of<br>nydia and i must say it's also an honor<br>for nydia to have such esteemed scholars<br>associated with the institute<br>lastly i'd like to thank my exceptional<br>colleagues at nydia who make the<br>institute what it is tahu kukutai<br>polyatatoka aramarata yarajarala moana<br>radere shefali pawa<br>indian renee dixon shamanic haseem jesse<br>whitehead jonathan kilgaar and other<br>visiting and linked staff and of course<br>those who have come and gone over the<br>years<br>nydia is made by the people who work<br>there and give it their passion and give<br>their passion to it and so today is also<br>an acknowledgement of your efforts and<br>those are people who have come and gone<br>before us<br>now we have sought to frame this<br>anniversary event around the whakatauki<br>kamua kamuri which speaks to the idea of<br>walking backwards into the future having<br>an eye to the past as we seek to engage<br>and construct new possibilities<br>now while i think this is opposite for<br>an anniversary of any kind kamua kamuri<br>is particularly pertinent to thinking<br>about population about the population<br>histories and changes that bring us here<br>today and how they are necessarily<br>shaping the futures that we are moving<br>towards<br>and creating<br>sometimes said that demography is<br>destiny and that's not what i mean by by<br>that comment yes the demographic trends<br>uh persist over time in the influence<br>where we're at but the histories of<br>populations in different places in<br>alterador um and how they are influenced<br>by<br>by the different kinds of political<br>social and economic configurations that<br>we have experienced in this place<br>whether it's settler colonialism whether<br>it's migration or whether it's other<br>matters and those are the things that<br>shape we were at but also give us<br>opportunities to create different kinds<br>of futures<br>in preparing for this welcome speech and<br>the 10th anniversary of nydia i've done<br>some reflections on what it means to be<br>a national institute in altar today<br>particularly an institute with a central<br>focus on population matters<br>nydia was established 10 years ago with<br>the explicit aim of helping to inform<br>choices and responses to the demographic<br>social and economic interactions that<br>are shaping altered or new zealand's<br>future<br>put otherwise nydia was always more than<br>a base for advancing research it wasn't<br>just doing about doing papers and<br>getting them published it was about<br>influencing this country's future<br>development and doing so in relation to<br>the demographic and economic challenges<br>we face<br>as altera's only institute of population<br>focus research this objective is most<br>appropriate and for the previous 10<br>years media researchers have provided<br>insightful robust and influential<br>population research that i believe has<br>been of substantial value to the wide<br>range of stakeholders we engage with<br>of course nydia has also always been an<br>institute at the leading edge of<br>population research internationally<br>media researchers today and those who<br>have spent time here in the past are<br>well known for their contributions to<br>scholarship on core demographic trends<br>and analysis as well as a diversity of<br>other population dynamics indigenous<br>data sovereignty the changing character<br>of migration regulation fertility the<br>economics of ethnic diversity population<br>health and much more<br>today nedi arranges its research around<br>four broad interconnected themes<br>maori and indigenous populations<br>migration<br>population health and equity and<br>population change<br>our research spans these areas but also<br>intersects in many ways the relations<br>between migration and population change<br>for example maori perspectives and<br>responses to migration health inequities<br>experienced by maori and pacific<br>populations and much more<br>as fitting for a population studies<br>institute our work is fundamentally<br>multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary<br>in my view however a national institute<br>in contemporary altera has a broader<br>remit than informing policy decisions<br>and leading international research not<br>least given the uncertain and troubling<br>times that we live in of recent<br>experiences of rapid population change<br>the present global pandemic racism<br>violence and inequality and many other<br>matters that are shaped by and impinge<br>on population dynamics<br>in this context a national institute<br>also has an obligation to be a critical<br>voice to raise questions about present<br>population matters and the ways in which<br>populations are measured and governed in<br>this country<br>in this respect i'm very proud of the<br>work that our researchers at nydia<br>undertake and the impact that it has and<br>i think i just want to talk to you<br>briefly about two projects two recently<br>funded large projects that i think tell<br>some of this story very well<br>tikanga in technology a project<br>exploring indigenous approaches to<br>transforming data ecosystems that is led<br>by professor tahu kukutai alongside<br>associate professors maui hudson and the<br>faculty of maori and indigenous studies<br>and tetaka keegan in the school of<br>computing and mathematics here both here<br>at the university of waikato<br>the project focuses on how tikanga maori<br>and mataranga maori inform the<br>construction of digital identities and<br>can reshape understandings of relational<br>responsibilities to data<br>now some of that relates to data this<br>population data why does that matter<br>well it matters because the ways in<br>which the types of population data we're<br>using and the ways in which they use are<br>shifting<br>there's a shift from focusing on<br>standardized five yearly sensors towards<br>an increasing use of micro data through<br>the integrated data infrastructure<br>linked data that raises all kinds of<br>questions about the ethics of how data<br>is gathered how it's stored how it's<br>used to what ends who owns that data<br>these are critical questions that<br>include questions of population and<br>understanding population but go well<br>beyond that to thinking about the<br>implications of doing population work<br>such work addresses pressing matters in<br>the production of data sets in the usage<br>storage and the significance of<br>algorithms and other technology in<br>knowledge production yes in relation to<br>population as well as in a wide range of<br>other<br>areas another recently funded large<br>program of research is wedo to challenge<br>widow stands for working to end racial<br>oppression it's a project led by dr<br>waikirimana waitoki and the faculty of<br>maori and indigenous studies but also<br>involves dr dr aramarata associate<br>professor polyata<br>and myself here at nydia<br>this research is seeking to examine the<br>costs systems and potential responses to<br>racism and alterator focusing on four<br>interlinked societal domains where<br>racism is particularly prevalent<br>employment where all the prejudice that<br>occurs around recruitment progression<br>pay<br>and career development<br>housing and all we know about<br>affordability<br>access the location of different types<br>of housing the environments that people<br>live in and how that is underpinned by<br>systems of racism<br>institutions hospitals prisons the<br>police<br>universities<br>places that can reproduce indeed can<br>have at their core<br>issues of systemic racism and for<br>nangatanga community relations exploring<br>new ways in which we might actually seek<br>to overturn or transform relations<br>underpinned by racism<br>the widow program demonstrates how<br>significant population research is<br>altered or how diverse our methods can<br>be<br>and the applications of our research can<br>be and the role that an institute like<br>nydia can play in transforming society<br>for the better<br>from my perspective it is this focus on<br>driving the national conversation<br>influencing policy and aiming for<br>transformation that is at the core of<br>nydia's focus as a research institute<br>today<br>as many of you will probably know my<br>colleagues are regularly drawn upon to<br>provide commentary in a wide range of<br>media they're called upon serving key<br>advisory positions for government and<br>community organizations and undertake<br>research that addresses wicked<br>challenges like homelessness data<br>sovereignty racism health inequalities<br>migrant exploitation force migration and<br>refugee resettlement to name just a few<br>you'll hear more about some of these<br>areas today in the presentations and<br>panels to follow and of course i invite<br>you to visit our website to find out<br>more for yourself<br>nedia also delivers aotearoa's only<br>population studies teaching program and<br>we have a small but vibrant set of<br>undergraduate offerings<br>and have been privileged to host and<br>work with a diverse group of<br>postgraduate students especially those<br>completing phds over many years and<br>including both students who have emerged<br>here in atero as well as those who have<br>come from overseas to spend time with us<br>you'll hear a little from some of our<br>recent graduate students in a session<br>after lunch and you'll spot some of them<br>here as well wandering around so please<br>take the time to talk to them and of<br>course as a plug if you are interested<br>in upskilling yourself in population<br>studies and research<br>come talk to me look at the website and<br>we'll be happy to have you<br>we have a very interesting program for<br>the rest of today following me professor<br>tahu kukutai will be delivering the<br>keynote address for today's event<br>focusing on altera 2100 the long view i<br>guess a fenue for our mokopuna following<br>tahu's keynote we will move straight<br>into a panel session exploring the<br>waikato region challenges and<br>opportunities<br>after we break for lunch we will have<br>two more sessions firstly centering on<br>our whakatauki kamua kamuri walking into<br>the future with an eye to the past we<br>will hear there from emeritus professor<br>ian poole on the origins of the<br>institute before hearing from some<br>recent past graduate students at nydia<br>we then have a panel exploring migration<br>with a particular focus on futures<br>beyond the current covet 19 global<br>pandemic<br>following on from that panel i would<br>like to invite you all to join us for a<br>late afternoon reception which will be<br>held just in the bar area um outside<br>so thank you once again for joining us<br>to both celebrate nidia's past 10 years<br>but also to look forward to the<br>challenges that confront us now and in<br>the coming decades<br>we value your support and look forward<br>to working with you a lot more in the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
