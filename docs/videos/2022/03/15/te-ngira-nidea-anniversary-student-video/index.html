professor<br>tahu kukutai<br>hi i'm jesse whitehead i did my phd at<br>nidia between 2017 and 2020.<br>ross lawrenson and paulie atator car<br>were my supervisors<br>kia ora my name is renee sam<br>i have studied with nadia for both my<br>undergrad and postgraduate degrees and i<br>completed my phd from nadia at the<br>beginning of 2021. my name is me alimi i<br>completed my phd as a joint student of<br>media and waikato management school hi<br>i'm anger<br>i'm from indonesia<br>i did my masters<br>i studied at the university of waikato<br>at media and completed a<br>honours degree and a masters<br>hello my name is rachel mcmillan i<br>undertook a masters of demography in<br>2015 at nydia with natalie jackson and<br>studying at nydia has been an incredibly<br>valuable and eye-opening experience<br>and the program of study offered at<br>nydia is incredibly accessible no matter<br>what your background is in and you can<br>take your knowledge from<br>disciplines and fields such as geography<br>sociology social policy and economics<br>and they can be used to inform how you<br>research an issue from a population lens<br>there were some<br>awesome experience during my study<br>the first thing is<br>since i'm<br>an international student with english is<br>not my first language<br>so it was very challenging<br>fortunately<br>the media staff were really helpful to<br>make my study much easier supervisors it<br>felt like they were generally interested<br>in<br>what i was doing and developing my<br>research skills so they helped me to get<br>both a population level perspective and<br>to kind of drill in on some of those key<br>details so i felt like they really<br>supported me along my journey it was<br>really great<br>i had exposure to a really diverse range<br>of lecturers who had different kind of<br>specializations<br>such as<br>sociology<br>political science<br>economics but they all had the kind of<br>common focus of<br>demography so it was really interesting<br>seeing how different the different<br>academic interpretations of demography<br>and how that could be applied<br>the skills and knowledge that i gained<br>at nydia has really helped me in my<br>career journey<br>i'm very grateful that for the<br>tremendous support and belief that<br>natalie jackson had in me and her<br>ability to open doors<br>i'm very grateful for the knowledge that<br>i gained from bill cochran<br>in political ramifications of policy<br>making and research<br>they have been invaluable<br>in the work that i do today<br>my experience studying at nydia was very<br>positive i enjoyed being a part of the<br>nitty-grano and really building<br>relationships across students and<br>faculty and staff we started out very<br>small there were only a few of us post<br>grad students<br>and eventually we grew to a much larger<br>number but those relationships remained<br>very close it was fantastic because of<br>the staff and the collegiate nature of<br>the senior people there so i got to work<br>with people who were experts in their<br>field and<br>give a lot of access to your time you<br>could be trying to walk down the<br>corridor and chat to people ask them<br>questions they were also interested in<br>your work<br>and you also had access to nice<br>facilities like the integrated data<br>infrastructure which i used for most of<br>i am now an assistant professor of<br>sociology and american indian studies at<br>ucla the university of california at los<br>angeles i am also an affiliate<br>researcher at the california population<br>research center where i engage in a<br>variety of population research projects<br>specific to american indians and<br>indigenous peoples<br>today i work as a senior regional<br>visitor planner for the department of<br>conservation<br>i help write destination management<br>plans and master plans for our key<br>iconic locations<br>such as milford sound piop otahi<br>i work at the new zealand treasury as an<br>analyst i work and that are portfolios<br>of maori development education and<br>women's affairs<br>and<br>my role is really interesting very<br>diverse very challenging sometimes<br>kind of their<br>role involves<br>advising ministers on<br>funding decisions<br>both kind of immediate and long term<br>and how those contribute to living<br>standards for<br>new zealanders<br>and specifically maori now i'm working<br>on two health research council-funded<br>projects<br>one is around developing a<br>morality classification for new zealand<br>that's designed for health research and<br>policy purposes and so modifying the<br>kind of generic stats nz model<br>and and tweaking it so it fits better<br>for what we know about health<br>after my first year of master's at needy<br>i got the opportunity to intern at the<br>treasury i worked in the national<br>infrastructure unit and then after my<br>master's i got to work with ernst young<br>as a risk and performance performance<br>improvement analyst in wellington<br>and then came back for my phd<br>and now i work as a lecturer in the<br>white house management school<br>i work for<br>mr center for<br>population

policy<br>analyst with the ministry of social<br>development<br>and my doctoral research examined the<br>understandings and governance of<br>homelessness internationally and in<br>aotearoa and i was also really fortunate<br>to use the people's project in hamilton<br>as a case study to explore the enablers<br>and barriers of implementing a housing<br>first response to homelessness<br>in the new zealand policy context where<br>the public sector has no mandate to<br>respond</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
