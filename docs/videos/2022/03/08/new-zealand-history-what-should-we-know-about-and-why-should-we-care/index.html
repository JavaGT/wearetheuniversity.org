otago<br>community joining us here this evening<br>and it's great to have the opportunity<br>to share some thoughts on new zealand<br>history<br>and how we make sense of it and what it<br>means for us in new zealand uh today so<br>thank you very much for taking the time<br>to join us this evening<br>in the talk there are basically going to<br>be three sections the first one i'll<br>share some thoughts on what we should<br>know about new zealand history<br>in the second section which is<br>reasonably short just some reflections<br>on history and identity<br>and then in the third section i'll come<br>back to thinking local and think about<br>this place otago for example and<br>particularly the context for the<br>so<br>uh<br>debates over how we think about our<br>colonial past in new zealand regularly<br>flare<br>in recent times there was projected<br>debate about the tui 250 program that<br>was designed to mark the 200th<br>anniversary of the arrival of the<br>endeavour captained by james<br>then in 2020 the toppling of the statue<br>commemorating edward colston in bristol<br>a merchant whose substantial fortune was<br>entangled with the atlantic slave trade<br>that event re-energized debates in new<br>zealand about statues and how to<br>remember our colonial past here in these<br>islands<br>at the same time there was a<br>long-running<br>debate over the place of new zealand<br>histories and the school curriculum<br>what kind of history should our children<br>be learning what should teachers focus<br>on and what kinds of things your story<br>should be set aside and that was a<br>protracted debate both within<br>the education profession but within<br>society more generally<br>and of course most recently there have<br>been a series of arguments um<br>over the legitimacy of new zealand as<br>the name for our nation and the<br>suggestion that it should be renamed old<br>tilda<br>and of course<br>as you see in one of the headlines there<br>we see<br>some influential naitahu leaders this<br>headline is about um edward ellison but<br>also the uh kaitahu historian tomorrow<br>have come out and<br>um stressed the primacy of tewai konamu<br>as the name for alfin were here in the<br>south<br>so these debates are a common feature of<br>public life in new zealand<br>so given that these questions are<br>politically contentious<br>and often uh people feel like they feed<br>a whole lot of conflict why should we<br>really care about new zealand history<br>and more broadly if we are to care about<br>new zealand history what should we know<br>about<br>the history of these islands it has<br>become commonplace and academic circles<br>to suggest that new zealanders<br>especially pakia<br>are uninterested in the past<br>and that we are adept at forgetting some<br>difficult histories<br>in reality i think this is a fairly<br>partial<br>uh and not particularly useful<br>characterization<br>um there is a very long tradition of<br>writing about our history<br>the first general history of new zealand<br>was published in 1859 and he received a<br>title page<br>uh a work by the military doctor aius<br>thompson<br>which reflected on the transformation of<br>modern society the beginnings of<br>colonization and was critical of uh we<br>might know both james cook but also the<br>government's lack of<br>engagement with maori<br>so there's a long tradition here within<br>20 years of formal colonization<br>histories of the country were already<br>being written<br>but we have not generally<br>taught our history in a sustained manner<br>in our schools until recently students<br>in years seven to ten<br>would learn<br>in a piecemeal fashion about the treaty<br>of waitangi and some other significant<br>aspects of new zealand's history<br>and the social studies curriculum<br>and few students taught history<br>uh comparatively few students talk<br>history as a subject uh in years<br>11 12 and 13 for ncaa<br>and even uh those who did take history<br>in those higher years of security<br>schooling did not necessarily study new<br>zealand topics<br>so i think it's incredibly important for<br>us<br>to teach<br>about new zealand and our schools and<br>both social studies and history<br>this is critical if we want to build<br>cultural understanding and an<br>appreciation of the forces that have<br>shaped our society<br>from<br>the settling of new zealand from<br>polynesia by the people that would<br>become maori through to contact with<br>europeans and in the subsequent<br>colonisation of these islands<br>and i think it's very important that<br>history in schools<br>should not just be a rosy story of the<br>nation's progress and of course it's a<br>temptation we see in many nations across<br>the world but rather we should have a<br>really thoughtful and deep<br>engagement with the history of our<br>islands and the people that have made<br>their homes here<br>now i think it's true that colonization<br>is the central fact of new zealand<br>history and of our cultural life<br>and it must be prominent in what is<br>taught we cannot run away from our<br>colonial past<br>nor should our children be sheltered<br>from them<br>certainly the new zealand wars need to<br>be explored analyzed and understood and<br>of course it was the effort of<br>some north island high school students<br>who put together a petition around the<br>need to teach the<br>new zealand wars at high school it was<br>one of the main catalysts for these<br>debates<br>but we those wars should be not only<br>understood in their military<br>context they need to be also appreciated<br>in their economic social and political<br>dimensions<br>students need to be able to understand<br>the broad context of contours of our<br>past about colonization more broadly<br>about how disease war<br>land alienation and confiscation and<br>environmental change<br>undermine maori<br>political authority and communities and<br>shape the development of new zealand<br>society and this great image here from<br>tipapa<br>captures that extent of environmental<br>change and of course that was one of the<br>key features and drivers<br>i think it's really important too<br>that uh there is a board grappling with<br>the importance of race in our history<br>it's important that our children learn<br>about the experience of<br>uh in the 19th century in the 20th<br>century the history of anti-asian<br>immigration laws and new zealand's<br>pacific empire<br>in the 20th century of course<br>there's the continuing marginalization<br>of maori uh pacific migration and the<br>dawn raids of the 1970s are the kinds of<br>topics you'd also want to see<br>our high school students grappling with<br>those stories need to be brought into<br>dialogue with so those stories are and<br>in many ways the difficult stories the<br>stories that might make us feel a little<br>bit uncomfortable and they need to be<br>brought into dialogue with the stories<br>that we're much more comfortable telling<br>about ourselves so it's kind of<br>progressive histories which we're keen<br>to retell<br>um you know stories about the signing or<br>to traditional waitangi and its intent<br>um<br>stories about women's suffrage and the<br>great petition<br>and the legislation of 1893 stories<br>about new zealanders the world's social<br>laboratory<br>and our progressive<br>history of social<br>and<br>social development and<br>policy innovation<br>so that those are absolutely have to be<br>part of the story but we need a balanced<br>approach<br>i think it's also really important<br>though that we think<br>uh as historians and as teachers and we<br>teach our students to think locally as<br>well<br>so in addition to being introduced to<br>the elements of the national story and<br>how they relate to each other it's<br>essential that teachers ensure that<br>their pupils actively engage with local<br>histories the stories of hapu and ewi of<br>families and individuals who shape their<br>places and communities<br>local histories matter at least as much<br>as the national story<br>and of course our perspectives on the<br>past vary significantly depending where<br>we we are located in the world the world<br>seems a different place if you live in<br>parnell<br>if you live in ardanui or findleton<br>if you live in roseland or if you live<br>in kerashin rawini or riverton or like<br>these cantonese miners if you live in<br>the ida valley<br>or you live in central wellington and<br>this is something i'm going to come back<br>to in the final section of the talk<br>but it's also really important<br>and this image reminds us of of this<br>that<br>our school pupils are introduced to<br>wider forces<br>in history they not only learn<br>about an isolated new zealand history<br>uh that new zealand history should be<br>part of them being introduced to the<br>white history of the world<br>uh new zealand school pupils must<br>continue to learn about the two world<br>wars the holocaust political conflict in<br>ireland subjects that were a long time<br>staple of the old high school curriculum<br>civil rights movement in north america<br>and i know my daughter uh who's doing<br>year 11 history is is currently learning<br>that and that's absolutely fantastic<br>that she gets to engage with that kind<br>of material so it's really important<br>that our students get that wide<br>perspective<br>having some knowledge about those<br>developments not only helps our young<br>people understand the world that we live<br>in<br>but also provide some context for<br>important elements of our own national<br>history<br>so i think it's important that<br>high school students should learn<br>something about 18th and century british<br>and irish history<br>understanding the history of new zealand<br>politics and culture and making sense of<br>pakista identity is very difficult<br>without some basic knowledge of modern<br>britain and ireland<br>and of course britain built a<br>world-spanning empire and having some<br>understanding of how the movements of<br>animals<br>people money things and ideas around<br>that empire<br>helps us understand<br>how colonial new zealand developed<br>what is largely or actually in fact<br>almost entirely absent in many contexts<br>from new zealand schools is any serious<br>engagement with pacific history<br>um and of course that is the most<br>immediate of those broader contexts of<br>new zealand's history and it is a key<br>cultural frame<br>for contemporary new zealand life we are<br>a pacific society<br>more to our islands are within the<br>pacific ocean and it's really important<br>that we think about pacific history as<br>the broader context for our national<br>story<br>and i think there's a very serious gap<br>that must be addressed so if we think<br>about the story of new zealand world war<br>one we often think about gallipoli we<br>often think about the western front<br>those are hugely important stories<br>we think much less of our pacific<br>dimension of that story our occupation<br>of what was german samoa which was of<br>course our first act<br>beyond our borders<br>and worldwide world war one and it was a<br>key passage in the extension of new<br>most new zealanders um<br>until very recently did not learn much<br>or any new zealand history at school<br>but i think almost all new zealanders do<br>have some knowledge of the past and this<br>is where i think the argument that<br>parque are forgetful is is not<br>necessarily very helpful<br>we all have those rich tales<br>of<br>making homes and forging relationships<br>narratives of love and loss that are<br>central and family stories<br>faith tales of faith and belief sickness<br>and health<br>hard work and recreation the kind of<br>stories that are repeated within<br>families<br>about parents about uncles and aunts<br>grandparents<br>cousins earlier generations<br>we access those stories through family<br>trees and through whakapapa through<br>photo albums<br>and as i said through oft repeated<br>family tales this image here is of my<br>wife's great great grandfather william<br>sheriff burst and his family in<br>glenorchy<br>they were publicans they had their<br>family had moved up to glenorchy and<br>they became quite prominent figures as<br>publicans and then they fell on hard<br>times after a hotel fire and became<br>she-like miners<br>so you know if we think about each<br>branch of our family tree<br>every branch is full of<br>uh<br>drama<br>full of emotion and is really<br>significant so<br>um<br>recognizing and gripping that human<br>richness i think is really important<br>so our stories about our past uh were<br>called not just in school classrooms but<br>in homes on modai and places of worship<br>and at cemeteries and urupa<br>and these human stories are vital<br>threads in the histories of these<br>islands<br>and they provide important perspectives<br>on the past too<br>so what happens in schools is really<br>important but that's not the only place<br>where we think and we should learn about<br>history<br>and of course we encounter the past in<br>all sorts of places we encounter in our<br>money and our stamps but if you think<br>about the banknotes we know<br>and we encounter our national heroes on<br>a regular basis sir edmund hillary kate<br>shepherd sir upon another ernest<br>rutherford feature on their notes<br>and learning something about those<br>iconic focus is really important<br>but looking beyond those<br>national heroes if you like is also<br>significant and i think it's really<br>important to recognize that for some<br>people thinking biographically thinking<br>about people's lives is one of the the<br>most immediate ways to engage with the<br>past<br>so just to take one<br>just to take one example<br>what do you know about margaret<br>crookshank have you heard about margaret<br>cooking<br>margaret was born in locality or<br>hawkesbury as it was then called just<br>north of dunedin in 1873.<br>she completed her schooling at otago<br>girls high school and then she came to<br>university of otago where she studied<br>medicine<br>she graduated with the degree of<br>bachelor of medicine in 1897 just the<br>second woman in new zealand to do so<br>she subsequently became the first new<br>zealand woman to register as a doctor<br>and subsequently to engage in general<br>medical practice and her practice was in<br>the south canterbury town of waimati<br>she continued to study<br>taking a doctoral medicine from otago<br>and taking a short period of time away<br>from waimati to go to<br>dublin and edinburgh to pursue further<br>education<br>she returned to south canterbury and she<br>was an integral member of the local<br>community playing a vital role during<br>world war one<br>and then she led the local response to<br>the outbreak of the devastating<br>influenza epidemic at the end of 1918.<br>she herself became a victim of that<br>pandemic a bitter blow to the people of<br>the district<br>she is the subject of one of the very<br>few public statues of a woman in our<br>country<br>a memorial statue that was directed by<br>the people of waimati in 1923 and it<br>bears the inscription<br>the beloved physician<br>faithful unto death<br>but hers is just one of so many stories<br>and one thing that i think is fantastic<br>and it's an amazing resource uh to<br>explore is our dictionary of new zealand<br>biography and all the associated<br>resources that sit on<br>the website tiara uh the encyclopedia of<br>new zealand and that's at tiana.gov<br>dot nz and it's an amazing website so i<br>think no matter whether you're 17 in a<br>high school<br>or 70<br>i it's never too late to begin to think<br>about the history of these islands to<br>explore the landscape<br>to go to our museums<br>and we have some amazing heritage<br>institutions in the country<br>to read widely and to think about the<br>forces that have shaped our communities<br>and of course it's not even too late to<br>look at a few statues<br>actually why matthew has some some<br>fantastic statues in public art<br>okay so<br>i'm going to turn now to talk a little<br>bit about the connections between<br>um history and identity<br>and one of the reasons why history<br>matter matters is it helps us understand<br>the society that we live in<br>this section of the thought's very short<br>but it makes some really important<br>points<br>this is a hugely important image<br>it's a drawing of cross-cultural contact<br>a trade between a european figure who<br>was actually joseph banks the botanist<br>on the endeavor and a maori man at uawa<br>or toliga bay<br>in 1769.<br>and it's a moment of reciprocity and<br>exchange<br>banks<br>is offering perhaps a sheet of paper in<br>his right hand or perhaps it's tapa<br>cloth that is bought from tahiti he's<br>exchanging that with the the maori man<br>with the very fine korowai and in return<br>he's getting a spectacular crayfish<br>this is a an image that's really<br>important because it is produced by<br>a man called tupaya tupaya is a ritual<br>expert<br>a cultural translator a diplomat a<br>linguist<br>um a remarkable traveler who came on the<br>endeavour with james traveling from<br>his homeland in royal tier<br>coming here to new zealand and<br>eventually going to australia with the<br>endeavour and he unfortunately died<br>in indonesia on the endeavour's track<br>home<br>it is a really important image though<br>because um<br>it<br>i think speaks to that kind of<br>triangular nature of our history if you<br>like the engagements between the people<br>that became maori people that became<br>parker and pacific people<br>and it reminds us of that broader<br>pacific setting for our histories<br>but it also speaks<br>to the really important dynamic that<br>comes out of these meetings<br>the sense of cultural discovery a sense<br>of self-awareness a sense of a<br>shifting place in the world and that's<br>captured beautifully in the hakka<br>composed<br>and mobilized in the work of anne salman<br>that links this image to these kinds of<br>i<br>encounters<br>um<br>really highlighting the idea about<br>strangeness and mutual discovery so<br>engagement such as this generated new<br>understandings about cultural difference<br>about the shape of the world<br>and about belonging<br>we have a remarkable account of cox<br>tanifa<br>who was a young boy maybe age eight or<br>nine when the endeavour arrived at<br>fitiana he recorded this record in 1852<br>when he was very old uh by the collector<br>john white<br>and it's a remarkable account if you've<br>got your phone and you're interested<br>grab a screenshot and check out the web<br>link it is an amazing account of the<br>arrival of europeans<br>so i've just given you two short<br>extracts here<br>the account stresses the strangeness of<br>europeans the way they looked the way<br>they talked and the way they acted so it<br>talks quite a lot about um<br>the strange practices of who we know to<br>be joseph banks botanizing and it talks<br>about young maori uh people in futile<br>picking up rocks and stones and leafs<br>and twigs and giving them to banks and<br>he'll look at them and examine them and<br>throw them away rather putting them in<br>his specimen bag<br>it talks about banks using a gun and it<br>was the first time they saw a gun and<br>and banks shooting birds<br>and it talks about cook himself and it<br>emphasizes what they see as<br>kindness but also has strangeness<br>and one of the things i really like<br>about the account<br>is that one of the main markers of how<br>strange europeans are is that they rose<br>to the shore with their backs towards<br>their destination of course for maori in<br>the waking you paddle forwards<br>and<br>for a community whose world was defined<br>by the ocean and where waka was so<br>central in their their cultural<br>orientation that's a really important<br>marker<br>of difference<br>so it's out of these<br>meetings that ideas and identities<br>emerge amongst others the idea of being<br>and this is another pretty amazing text<br>this comes from<br>an 1820 book<br>published under the name of thomas<br>kendall but produced<br>together with the rangatira hong kong<br>warrior chief and waikato<br>when they went to england they went to<br>cambridge to produce a grammar of the<br>maori language and this dialogue<br>is fantastic if you look halfway down<br>the page<br>it talks about maori as people of the<br>land in english and there is tangata<br>maori<br>do the people of the land deal peaceably<br>with europeans<br>later on it says ask the question are<br>the europeans naturalized<br>another way i think we might think about<br>the sentences are the europeans becoming<br>normal<br>and and the way that's described is kamu<br>mauritia to pakia so are pakia becoming<br>normal<br>and the response i think is a great one<br>how can i tell you i'm not sure<br>and it was probably an open question in<br>1820 but this is a great text because it<br>gives you a snapshot<br>of that process with these identities<br>we're beginning to make take shape<br>so running through these meetings is a<br>question called way who are you<br>where do you come from where do you<br>belong<br>and and through these texts we get terms<br>like tangata<br>and this one tangata maori<br>where maori with the small m<br>means ordinary normal usual natural<br>and we get the emergence of maori at the<br>beginning the ordinary people the people<br>of the place the people who belong and<br>were here before<br>and of course pakia<br>and there's a controversy there's been<br>long standing controversy about what<br>pakeha comes from it probably derives<br>from<br>probably meaning strange bringing<br>there is a suggestion um from nachi<br>prado that it could be a rendering of a<br>shipboard chant<br>um a european shipboard chant into<br>chilean maori but the thing about<br>parkour is that it's doing two things<br>it's saying that these people are new<br>that they are different but it's also<br>defining them in relation to maori<br>tomorrow the people who are already here<br>the last one i really want to emphasize<br>is takata porter<br>and it may be one that you're not so<br>familiar with but i like all new<br>zealanders tonight because this is<br>actually the term that we see most<br>commonly in texts before say 18<br>35 18 no before 1840 say in otago and<br>southampton this is the name that<br>kaitahu gave to the newcomers<br>literally the boat people the people who<br>have arrived on boats<br>so this is particularly given to<br>sailors and to whalers<br>and to<br>the traders that come ashore<br>often from new south wales but also from<br>france from britain and from new england<br>so i just like the intersection with<br>this image uh by the great um cliff<br>whiting uh and means figure and uh moldy<br>art<br>um an amazing carver this is the image<br>he drew for the cover of the first<br>waitangi tribunal report<br>um and it emphasizes the connections<br>that both enable the signing of teaching<br>and the connections that spiral out of<br>it<br>and of course<br>um<br>you know for many maori it was<br>understood that the treaty<br>was a kind of covenant it was a kind of<br>sacred compact<br>many colonists on the other hand largely<br>disregarded that not all but many did<br>and<br>they sought land they sought opportunity<br>and social advancement and with time<br>many were largely disconnected from<br>maori so that kind of entanglement and<br>connectedness that this image imagines<br>is not necessarily what actually unfolds<br>at least on the parking side so i just<br>like to talk about that by<br>really turning<br>now to the place where i'm talking from<br>um from the the<br>um<br>from dunedin from otago and from the<br>place our university are developed in<br>so<br>as i said before it's really important<br>to think of the past not only in<br>national terms but to think about<br>regions<br>and places<br>um<br>and i think it is really important if<br>we're going to understand<br>the range and texture and complexity of<br>the histories of the peoples of these<br>islands<br>um we need to really be committed to<br>doing so<br>um and we in doing that gives us also a<br>really quite differentiated sense of the<br>the history<br>of these islands because the history of<br>a table in southland is quite different<br>from the history of canterbury my father<br>was always deeply convinced of this he<br>believed that the waitaki river was a<br>very profound cultural divide um<br>he was a chauvinist i think and of you<br>know a great lover of otago and<br>southland and skeptical of things<br>further north<br>but there's a long tradition of<br>identifying strongly with our provinces<br>and and you know there are very real<br>differences if you travel from dunedin<br>uh<br>up to the east cape it's a different<br>place if you travel from the east cape<br>to the west coast of the south island<br>it's a different place<br>so those local and regional histories<br>are really important so let's turn to<br>otago<br>and let's start with a boat<br>and actually starting with a boat is<br>pretty much always the way we start in<br>new zealand history if you think about<br>the ancestral waka that came from the<br>pacific<br>to syria<br>maui and to waipanamu and<br>the kohu and all the other maltu to make<br>up new zealand<br>if we think about abel tasman arriving<br>in 1642 with his two little ships<br>if we think about james cook's endeavour<br>in 1769<br>or if we think about maybe the dunedin<br>in 1892 which took that first shipment<br>of frozen meat from port charmas<br>to europe so boats are really important<br>for us and much of our history starts<br>with the ship<br>down here in otago and south and of<br>course we often think about the arrival<br>of john wickliffe and this is an image<br>of the philip lane which arrived on the<br>15th of april<br>pulling in towards port charmas<br>joining the john wickliffe did his first<br>two ships to establish the otago colony<br>john wickliffe had arrived<br>a little bit earlier on the 23rd of<br>and it was a long voyage and by the time<br>the john wickliffe was pushing east of<br>australia its crew and passengers were<br>looking forward to sighting the land<br>the land that was to be their new home<br>they had left england over three months<br>earlier and of course many of them on<br>board were from scotland so they had<br>earlier traveled<br>to board<br>the john wickliffe<br>on the 18th of may the passengers began<br>spirit are preparing<br>a special banner to mark their arrival<br>in otago there was a challenge they<br>didn't have any suitable material<br>immediately at hand<br>and eventually the ingenious mrs<br>nicholson the wife of the of the<br>presbyterian minister jaden nicholson<br>came up with a solution<br>she was prepared to offer up her wedding<br>dress to create the banner so her<br>wedding dress of silk so blue<br>was offered to create the banner that<br>was carried aloft<br>when the crew<br>and colonists stepped ashore<br>on the following day the 19th of march<br>excitement rose as the passengers<br>saw the sneers islands<br>and then rocky order was stewart island<br>on the 20th the john wick of sail path<br>of the mata o or the closer river<br>the wind dropped the following day the<br>21st and progress was slow along the<br>coast<br>thomas farrens a methodist missionary<br>who was dispatched to assist with<br>charles creed's missionary worker by<br>kuwaiti<br>quite like the view though as they were<br>sitting off the coast he was very<br>impressed by what he called settle back<br>hill or we of course known as saddle<br>hill<br>and noted that there were many striking<br>landmarks<br>the dayside progress left<br>our colonists eager um<br>for land and from making it to their new<br>home<br>but they ended up some six miles off<br>cape saunders<br>they were struck by the abundant<br>wildlife especially the birds<br>the therons made a list<br>birds of all descriptions are here gulls<br>whale birds sea pigeons albatrosses<br>cormorants<br>he also went on to suggest that the air<br>is most delightful<br>and we might be a little skeptical of<br>this next bit<br>the sky is sultry ethereal<br>quite of the italian character and i'm<br>not sure whether that's an entirely<br>plausible description or not and his<br>journal entry concluded oh what<br>restlessness and anxiety<br>encourages and to be<br>he was really struck by the environment<br>fairings<br>it seemed to him that he was<br>encountering nature triumphant and the<br>beauty of the harbour and its heavily<br>forested shores was such that it made<br>him<br>um rejoice and<br>adore the divine being<br>eventually when they went on shore on<br>the 23rd<br>he went with the party of other<br>passengers and explored the bush-clad<br>hills behind port charmers<br>they didn't take any food with them<br>but they ended up sharing a meal of fish<br>and kumara with two kaitaku men before<br>ascending to the very top of the hill<br>that shared meal that farron's and his<br>colonial friends and kaitaku men shared<br>echoed an important moment that occurred<br>on the previous day<br>march 22nd<br>on the 22nd the john wickliffe was held<br>off the heads but wasn't able to come<br>into the harbour because the country<br>wins<br>charles kettle the new zealand company<br>surveyor also the artist who produced<br>this image and richard driver the pilot<br>wore boats out to john wickliffe's<br>anchorage<br>there was much discussion and excitement<br>and some frustration and not arriving on<br>shore<br>but some of the passengers used this<br>time to good effect<br>henry monson an english methodist<br>colonist who would become well known as<br>dunedin's first jailer<br>and who was not<br>necessarily particularly deciduous in<br>this job<br>his son john and thomas ferens<br>went out in a boat<br>and they went out in a boat with three<br>kaikaku men<br>who came<br>to the john wickliffe to take columns<br>fishing<br>the kaitahu men took them to a place<br>where they could catch barracuda the<br>most highly prized fish and abundant<br>fish locally and taught them how to<br>catch them using a long pole with a<br>short piece of wood and a crooked nail<br>at the end<br>they caught three magnesium barracuda<br>and again shed a meal of fresh caught<br>fish<br>and kumara<br>other passengers ventured out with other<br>groups of kaita<br>including one headed by the great chief<br>team martinga toyota<br>these engagements<br>i think<br>suggested the possibility of a tradition<br>of collaboration and reciprocity but<br>that tradition did not really take shape<br>and where it did take shape on occasion<br>so i think that's an incredibly<br>poignant and powerful moment to reflect<br>on and this sharing of food and<br>knowledge was a warm and generous act<br>and it would be repeated many times over<br>the coming years when kai khan worked<br>closely to support and aid<br>individual colonists<br>but as a collective the coroners<br>themselves increasingly turned away from<br>the relationships implicit within the<br>gifts of kai<br>in the coming years manakitanga was met<br>with marginalization kaitahu and their<br>forms of social and economic<br>organization<br>were often identified as a problem and<br>were not seen as belonging to<br>the community of the otago colony<br>this kettle image is fantastic<br>looking into the harbour with port<br>charmas on the right<br>one of the things that's very<br>interesting is to notice the name he<br>gives the harbour or taco<br>rather than otago and in this time in<br>1848 many of the colonists called this<br>place more broadly otako picking up on<br>uh<br>maori name for the principal<br>settlement and of course also the<br>channel uh and current in the harbour<br>port chalmers will copyright that porch<br>harness as the colonists named it was a<br>key to the collins development it linked<br>otago to the world and was the beating<br>heart of the colony that pump people<br>commodities and money into the interior<br>and of course the incoming tide of<br>colonists would become increasingly less<br>connected to monophenol as i was<br>suggesting<br>particularly as they moved into the<br>interior<br>and turned it back to the sea<br>of course was gold<br>and gold<br>change<br>everything<br>the discovery the discovery of large<br>gold deposits in 1861<br>radically changed things<br>colonists flooded into the region<br>gold made the young colony energetic and<br>restless and that's why i love this<br>image from princess 3 1861 just after<br>gold's discovered the long exposure time<br>gives a<br>blur of movement<br>to the horses and to the people moving<br>along princess street<br>and you get a sense of the dynamism of a<br>society that's rapidly expanding because<br>of the discovery of gold<br>colonists flooded in and anything seemed<br>possible<br>at least for a moment<br>my valentine ancestors arrived in the<br>winter of 1861<br>and my great-grandfather john and his<br>dad francis immediately set off for the<br>gold fields<br>they turned out to be terrible miners it<br>was a giant disaster<br>before they returned to halfway bush<br>where they also turned out to be pretty<br>miserable farmers<br>so you know the story of our ancestors<br>is not always one immediate success<br>but because of gold the city grew<br>rapidly<br>the wealth of gold underpinned the<br>increasingly sophisticated cityscape<br>the corners established new workshops<br>factories and stores<br>banks and insurance companies supported<br>the growth of trade and shipping<br>the professions grew in significance<br>churches and educational institutions<br>proliferated think about our<br>high schools for example<br>and printing and publishing houses<br>multiplied<br>everything sped up<br>and the development of a university was<br>seen as key to promoting advanced<br>knowledge in the professions the<br>sciences and in the arts<br>colonists needed a university<br>they wanted graduates with specialist<br>skills and knowledge<br>to support an increasingly complex<br>colonial society<br>there had always been the idea of a<br>university to be established in the<br>otago colony but the idea got greater<br>currency in the mid 1860s<br>with some very strong support from key<br>leaders like the provincial<br>superintendent james mcandrew<br>and the reverend<br>dr thomas burns the principal minister<br>of the otago colony<br>many other public leaders especially<br>those further north were skeptical one<br>parliamentarian dismissed the idea of<br>the university of otago as absurd<br>when the central government decided that<br>new zealand was not ready for a for a<br>university of new zealand these men<br>decided that otago would go it alone<br>they found strong support from many<br>otago colonists and from the<br>presbyterian church which agreed to fund<br>two of the four foundational<br>professorships<br>and otago's provincial government passed<br>an ordinance on the 3rd of june 1869<br>establishing the university<br>so our university was born out of the<br>wealth of gold<br>it was born out of inspiration and<br>vision<br>and more than a little bit of<br>stubbornness<br>so<br>some<br>final reflections<br>as we<br>re-examine otago's past i think we need<br>to balance an appreciation of old-world<br>inheritances with the realities of<br>colonization which was a layered<br>which produced a layered complex messy<br>and often conflicted past<br>and i think that that insight is<br>applicable more broadly<br>so these difficult histories these messy<br>histories these histories of conflict<br>and accommodation misunderstanding and<br>struggle they're our histories<br>they are the histories that have made us<br>and the places that we live they have<br>made us as a national community<br>they have defined what is possible in<br>our present<br>and they have been pivotal in shaping<br>what<br>shaping these places that we live in<br>and the legacy of these paths are the<br>things that we continue to work through<br>as a historian<br>i'm really<br>deeply convinced that one of our roles<br>is to engage with the historical<br>dimensions of important political<br>and cultural issues in our moment now<br>and as such our writings function as a<br>kind of critical dialogue between the<br>past and the present<br>but<br>and this is something i always teach my<br>students in history our primary<br>responsibility as scholars is to the<br>past itself<br>to its<br>pastness<br>and by that i mean the ways in which the<br>past is different from our present<br>and we have a duty to the dead who can<br>no longer speak<br>it is our job to grapple with their<br>human complexity their motivations and<br>aspirations their actions<br>and perspectives<br>so let me end by observing that that<br>many elements of our colonial past are<br>painful<br>and we can never fully settle it<br>people often imagine and that it's a<br>kind of a vision you know a positive<br>vision if we can work through all the<br>waitangi tribunal settlements then maybe<br>we'll move on we will have settled the<br>past<br>i don't think we will<br>each generation<br>will discover the inner qualities of<br>colonialism and you each generation will<br>have to grapple with the legacies and<br>the issues that we're talking about<br>these are histories that cannot be<br>erased should not be forgotten but<br>rather should be reckoned with<br>and drawn upon as a starting point for<br>identifying what is our common past<br>and also honestly exploring the fault<br>lines that may well still divide us in<br>the prison<br>carefully thinking about the past not<br>only is good for our society<br>it enriches our lives and deepens our<br>understandings of where we live<br>who are our neighbors and who we are<br>ourselves<br>and those i think<br>can only be<br>so<br>thank you<br>thanks again for joining us and i think<br>sheila is going to moderate a few<br>questions<br>yes i am so thank you tony i thank you<br>formally in a minute i'm just going to<br>go through some of the questions we've<br>already received um and there is the<br>opportunity<br>to put some more questions in the chat<br>um so tony the first question we have is<br>thanks for the talk tony<br>an existential question for you does the<br>identity as a new zealander depend on<br>knowing the country's history<br>that's a great question<br>my<br>immediate response would be<br>you can be in new zealand you can<br>identify as a new zealander<br>without having a great knowledge of the<br>past but your<br>understanding of what it is to be in new<br>zealander and particularly<br>how other people might think about being<br>a new zealander<br>and varieties of identity and<br>uh belonging in our country will be much<br>richer if you have an understanding<br>of history<br>and i don't think that means you need to<br>know the history from beginning to end i<br>think it is something that you can<br>grapple with on a really human scale it<br>may be<br>you know going to a museum and spending<br>you know<br>some time looking at particular objects<br>looking at some new zealand art and<br>maybe mucking around on the web on the<br>tiada the new zealand um<br>encyclopedia page or reading the<br>dictionary of new zealand biography so i<br>don't think you have to master new<br>zealand history to be a new zealander or<br>to identify new zealander but i think<br>that<br>having a sense of our past<br>makes our presence much more<br>understandable<br>and<br>i i think it makes our society much<br>richer and hopefully more tolerant and<br>understanding<br>all right thank you tony next question<br>uh how important do you think it is that<br>i i think it is i think it's important<br>and i think it's one of the really<br>really positive<br>changes in our society if you look at<br>the media stories over the last couple<br>of years about the massive rush to<br>enroll<br>in chilean maori<br>courses not just for maori but pakia<br>for all new zealanders increasingly<br>recognizing the importance of trudeau<br>maori both as an official language of<br>new zealand but also appreciating it as<br>an important um doorway or portal into<br>teal maori more generally you know into<br>the maori world<br>and again you know everyone goes on<br>their journey at their own pace and in<br>their own way and you know i think there<br>is an anxiety often around that journey<br>but um i think i feel feel the fear and<br>doing it is a good thing and being brave<br>and even taking small steps<br>um is a great start so i i think it is<br>really important i i would say um<br>you know<br>thinking broadly about culture and<br>engaging with cultural difference is<br>really great and language is one really<br>important way of doing it<br>i one close to my heart as you know<br>sheila is food<br>um and that's another really important<br>way of exploring the cultures in these<br>islands<br>you know go to a farmers market or you<br>know a market of the weekend if you're<br>in auckland go out to the big south<br>auckland markets and<br>and explore some of the kai<br>there and and the rich tapestry of<br>cultures to make a society so there are<br>lots of ways language just happens to be<br>one especially good one i think<br>okay we've got about 10 minutes um next<br>question and a comment masterful<br>overview tony how should we teach<br>so i<br>yeah<br>we'll work through a process the<br>government's work through a process of<br>consulting around this<br>you know from my point of view<br>there are probably three or four main<br>points i think<br>students need to be introduced to the<br>pacific context of new zealand history<br>so they need to understand pacific<br>migrations and and<br>the settlement of new zealand by the<br>ancestors of the people who become maori<br>and that's really important because we<br>are a country located in in the southern<br>part of te moana new york the pacific<br>ocean<br>um pacifica people are a very important<br>part of our society<br>and new zealand has been always been a<br>part of the pacific and we have had a<br>pacific empire<br>and there are real things that we need<br>to reckon with there so i think that<br>pacific element is central<br>students need to be introduced to to<br>maori history and that's both<br>pre-contact with europeans in the<br>history of hapuniwe particularly in the<br>local place<br>and then<br>um<br>introduced to that story of of what<br>happens once europeans come and then<br>colonization proceeds<br>and i think thirdly<br>um<br>students should be introduced to to<br>local histories<br>and those local histories will shape how<br>that second part is taught about maori<br>history and history colonization<br>but it will also mean that<br>students will get an understanding of<br>local landscapes and the particular<br>pattern of local history and that's<br>really important<br>um because you know the history of our<br>places are really really different and<br>you know i said that before and even<br>neighborhoods within cities are very<br>different from each other<br>so they for me are the three<br>three key elements<br>and um<br>it's important that<br>the<br>students are getting introduced to it<br>really from a very early age<br>on and<br>i would love to see more students<br>carrying through to to year 13.<br>but i think that will be<br>partly dependent upon us getting a<br>richer range and texture of things into<br>the classroom<br>rather than always teaching the same<br>things in the same way and that's<br>something that you know<br>some of the university students say is<br>that you know we often operate within<br>quite narrow channels so the breadth of<br>our history is amazing and embracing<br>that breadth is really important<br>i think you may have um answered this<br>question but um there's a question but<br>from melissa about i'm aware that a huge<br>tension especially in primary schools is<br>navigating the uncomfortable histories<br>i know it's tiffany o'regan's comments<br>about history being nuanced and not<br>diminishing this to a goody bad writer<br>yeah they ask for primary teachers with<br>no special training in history do you<br>have any advice for that<br>for those teachers so i mean i i you<br>know tattoo paneer oregon is a huge<br>inspiration uh and an immense figure<br>and a very wise man and um i would i<br>would be a very silly person to argue<br>against him publicly so<br>um<br>you know much wisdom what he says uh<br>melissa it's a great question and you<br>have identified<br>you know i think implicitly at least two<br>of the real challenges and one is is<br>um the training of teachers for this<br>um and the support of<br>of four teachers and secondly it is also<br>i think the materials to teach these<br>stories with<br>and we don't necessarily have a great<br>range of materials and particularly at<br>the local local histories and<br>particularly for primary schools i think<br>you know once kids are up and and doing<br>levels one two and three and ncaa<br>there's a whole range of stuff for local<br>histories<br>it's probably much harder for um<br>in primary school so<br>i think one of the best ways to do it is<br>probably in conjunction with museums<br>that of course put stress on on museums<br>but um and seeing some people in the<br>audience with some museum knowledge and<br>education knowledge i i think you know<br>there's um a real opportunity in that<br>space<br>for young people to be introduced to<br>histories in really manageable ways<br>through particular objects<br>and particular individual stories<br>and you know i always think about toy 2<br>here in dunedin<br>and it does a great job around the<br>history of some objects but also the<br>portrait gallery gallery that allows<br>young people to explore the histories of<br>individual people but i think it's a<br>it's a great question melissa and it<br>really is one of the the real world<br>challenges and translating the kind of<br>commitment we might have to the cultural<br>importance of history<br>into the classroom<br>okay<br>uh there's a question here from joe um<br>cura tony is there a good primer on new<br>zealand history for someone new to the<br>country perhaps something akin to zinn's<br>people's history of the united states<br>yeah and and howard zinn's books are you<br>know amazingly important and it does a<br>great job and and capturing a range of<br>voices<br>and perspectives there's nothing really<br>quite like how it's in for new zealand<br>yet<br>um<br>you know we've been<br>really well served by our historians<br>though so<br>i would give you a couple of<br>recommendations<br>um<br>michael king's penguin history<br>history of new zealand has a very<br>positive and affirming history of new<br>zealand that probably doesn't quite<br>grapple with some of the difficult<br>histories as well as i'd like but as a<br>fantastic and and positive framing of<br>our story<br>um<br>if you want to read something that's a<br>little bit more<br>scholarly packed full of ideas and and<br>an entertaining read james belich's<br>making peoples<br>i i think is<br>fantastic<br>i also think actually there's still<br>value in reading some of the older<br>general histories<br>um<br>in the late 1950s uh keith sinclair in<br>the early 1960s bill oliver produced<br>very short sort of 150 page histories of<br>new zealand did a great to read but i<br>would really recommend probably i think<br>the best starting point is tiara<br>dot gov dot nz so t e a r a<br>dot g o v<br>t dot nz<br>uh check that out there's an immense<br>array<br>of materials here and another great<br>website is new zealand history dot net<br>um and they're great ways you can kind<br>of navigate through a whole range of<br>stories<br>and are really good for<br>anyone who's got that kind of digital<br>sensibility<br>all right we've got time for one last<br>question and then um if people have<br>further questions<br>please i just reply to the invitation<br>that was sent to you and we will collate<br>them and<br>get a tony to have a look at them<br>question tony now that new zealand<br>history is compulsory what changes to<br>well<br>yeah that's a great question<br>i would expect to see changes but not<br>immediately<br>um that's a generational<br>project<br>i i think<br>um a couple of things i would like to<br>see<br>is<br>um<br>one is probably a greater<br>um understanding of the ongoing<br>pain caused by the history of empire and<br>colonization that that<br>that that is<br>for maori communities and then for<br>pacific peoples as well who are subject<br>to new zealand's pacific empire<br>that's not a distant removed remote past<br>that has ongoing legacies today and i<br>think understanding that but also<br>understanding the emotional weight of<br>that is is really important<br>um<br>i think um<br>another<br>uh<br>really important shift would be a<br>greater willingness<br>to listen and understand to other<br>perspectives and that's one of the key<br>things that history is a discipline<br>um<br>teaches um<br>i i think um<br>that that's hugely important i just say<br>that jeff has<br>kindly shared that link to tiara and the<br>chat so that's awesome um<br>yeah and and just on my end with michael<br>reason's question um<br>you know<br>colonization<br>was messy and complex and contradictory<br>and there may be things in that that<br>people see as positives<br>and<br>um of course there are obvious negatives<br>as well i think we need to as a society<br>to get to a place where we recognize<br>and we're comfortable with having those<br>conversations<br>um and and taking some cues from ta<br>tiffany in that regard but you know i<br>think it's great to be imposing that<br>question but i think we need<br>um<br>to really be prepared to explore our<br>past to own it<br>and and to recognize that it shapes our<br>present but that we're all the richer<br>for understanding it and that's probably<br>a nice point to end at<br>here<br>well thank you<br>in particular thank you so much tony<br>i've always loved listening to you<br>present and i love the imagery that you<br>use so i'd like to thank you personally<br>but also i know that all participants<br>that attended tonight would have loved<br>to hear from you um we will have a<br>recording of this available so um<br>we will let you know where to find that<br>um but thank you once again thank you<br>everybody who registered and came up i<br>come along tonight i certainly look<br>forward to seeing you on the further two<br>presentations that we have i'd like to<br>also thank my team um they've put this<br>on tonight and i'd like to thank them in<br>the background for all of their hard<br>work in putting this together thank you<br>everybody i hope you enjoyed it and we<br>look forward to seeing you at future<br>functions<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
