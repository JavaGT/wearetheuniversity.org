automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>everybody<br>i thought<br>today because of the turmoil that has<br>confronted us here in wellington<br>involving our pipeteat campus<br>and the turmoil that we're seeing in<br>other parts of the world and ukraine at<br>the moment it wouldn't be inappropriate<br>to start with the karakia<br>that talks about the need to calm the<br>winds<br>and that looks forward<br>to a bright dawn and a new day<br>so many of you will know<br>the karakia i'm proposing to<br>use<br>thank you<br>for joining us at taharingawaka victoria<br>university of wellington<br>for this recognition event for professor<br>grant guilford our vice chancellor for<br>many years<br>a man who has had a huge impact on this<br>city on our country and of course on<br>this remarkable institution our<br>university are you going to hear from<br>grant<br>in just a moment he has a presentation<br>he tells me powerpoint will take some<br>considerable time<br>after which we'll take questions and<br>that's the hand function that some of<br>you have already been using<br>if you raise your hand we should be able<br>to make sure that we can<br>um<br>we can get your question in and grant uh<br>has time to to answer it<br>i started by referencing the big<br>challenges that we're confronting uh in<br>our city at the moment with covert and<br>obviously with the protest<br>and last night when i had my normal<br>weekly catch up with grant and with<br>jennifer windsor who will be acting vice<br>chancellor<br>once grant leaves<br>you would not have known that grant was<br>retiring from the role<br>there was absolutely no indication<br>he was completely focused on the covert<br>challenge of feeding a thousand students<br>who were locked down in their rooms<br>isolating as a consequence of having<br>having had covered<br>and he was completely focused on the<br>challenges for both staff and students<br>in<br>navigating the closure of the pipatia<br>campus and how we relocated people how<br>we navigated uh that particular<br>challenge in our conversation last night<br>he was talking as much about the big<br>projects that we're currently<br>implementing the living part the<br>national music center<br>those projects that are going to define<br>the university going forward and giving<br>me clear instructions about how they<br>were to be implemented we were talking<br>about the future of pedagogy in the<br>future of the impact of technology<br>on the institution<br>as we move forward how international<br>forces were going to shape uh the future<br>of universities and what the opportunity<br>for a place-based institution<br>like te haringa waka was going to be in<br>that future there was no indication of<br>retirement there was no indication of<br>lack of focus there was no<br>lack of understanding who was in charge<br>and that has been my experience of grant<br>since i first met him uh when he joined<br>uh the university<br>he is a person of real vision<br>he is a person of real vigor and real<br>commitment he has a depth of intellect<br>and understanding that enables him to<br>wrestle with complex issues and find a<br>way through<br>but he is also a person who from the<br>outset and always<br>understands that universities are<br>primarily about the student and about<br>the academic and he's been consistently<br>focused uh through his time on ensuring<br>that the institution that he is building<br>will actually meet the needs of current<br>and future students and will attract the<br>excellent academics that we need to<br>teach them and to undertake the research<br>on which that teaching is based<br>in his time of course he's confronted<br>not just protests and pandemics but<br>earthquakes and all manner of other<br>challenges<br>these are complex institutions to lead<br>as many of you know<br>they're places where we have deep<br>intellectual rigour and we have youthful<br>enthusiasm and exuberance and we're<br>always at the cutting edge because the<br>young people year by year by year bring<br>the cutting edge to us<br>so it's complex territory it creates<br>great wisdom great courage great<br>fortitude great resilience<br>in all of that<br>grant has demonstrated and i can think<br>of no better recognition of his success<br>in this university you can look at it in<br>terms of what he's achieved in building<br>our rankings you can look at it and what<br>he's achieved in building out the number<br>of students now that we have the<br>building the presence of the institution<br>in our city<br>looking at our research and the pbrf um<br>success that we've had looking at the<br>key big projects capital projects the<br>buildings that he's that he's<br>constructed but i can think of no better<br>test either when we're looking for a new<br>vice chancellor we have a very strong<br>cohort of internal candidates who are<br>legitimately and properly contesting for<br>that role and that speaks to me about<br>his leadership that speaks to me about<br>his focus on people and i just want to<br>say to you grant this evening<br>i'm extremely privileged to have had a<br>chance to work with you in many<br>different guises over the years of your<br>vice chancellorship i greatly respect<br>the work you've done i do recognize the<br>significant stress that's placed on you<br>and on pauline and on your family<br>in the time that you've been leading the<br>institution<br>but i think you can be extraordinarily<br>proud of your achievements and we are<br>extraordinarily proud of you<br>and what you have contributed uh to this<br>institution<br>so with those preliminary words uh that<br>i hope were appropriate uh i'll ask<br>grant now to uh address us<br>thank you john i think they they were<br>more than appropriate so thank you very<br>much for that and and greatly appreciate<br>it<br>folks i'm going to um<br>share my screen in a moment and just<br>amble through a<br>brief<br>powerpoint description of the last<br>eight years and some of the key<br>challenges facing the university<br>i am in the middle of a fairly<br>significant multi-task at the moment so<br>if i go<br>silent that's because we've just had um<br>20 minutes ago and asked an attack on<br>the law faculty as the police were<br>clearing out the um<br>uh the protests so<br>if i have to disappear<br>i'll hand over to john and i'm sure john<br>will do a fine job and<br>in in finishing this presentation but<br>let me go to the presentation now and<br>so hopefully you can all see that um<br>john can you pick that up and others<br>coming through yep good thank you<br>so what i'm going to do is just take you<br>a bit<br>back to the strategic context of the<br>university this is the context that's<br>been defining<br>the actions that we've taken over the<br>last eight years<br>and of course that has changed over time<br>but some of the key features of that<br>remain<br>i'll talk briefly about how we have<br>weathered the covert 19 epidemic some of<br>the recent highlights<br>and finish with just a word on the 125th<br>anniversary<br>and then of course throw it open to you<br>for discussion<br>uh questions comments criticisms<br>whatever you want to dish up my way<br>the context is um<br>on the slide in the next one a rapidly<br>globalizing tertiary sector with elite<br>brands operating across borders<br>i'll just say that again a globalizing<br>tertiary sector with elite brands that<br>operate across borders and they do that<br>of course because with the advent of<br>online or blended education and so the<br>great brands of the world the great<br>universities of the world<br>are now in our backyard and in the<br>backyard of all new zealand universities<br>for us to continue to develop and<br>continue to have a world-class<br>university in new zealand<br>and in our city we need to be able to<br>compete now with these top brands and<br>that in turn<br>requires significant ambition<br>and it requires a level of<br>differentiation<br>and positioning which will come to spend<br>a little bit of time on in a moment<br>the greater use of online or blended<br>education is not just a reflection of<br>this globalization trend but also the<br>fact that a large cohort of new<br>zealanders want accessible education in<br>the in their employment so we're not<br>just any more about a school leaver<br>population we must also be thinking<br>about the adult learner and that our<br>learner values accessibility<br>over the campus experience that the<br>school leaver values<br>international education<br>been in the news a lot of course with<br>the closed borders<br>but<br>that has precipitated<br>a an emerging trend prior to that which<br>is to pivot to transnational education<br>rather than onshore delivery and so<br>you've seen some of the large<br>universities around the world begin to<br>open campuses offshore to deliver online<br>programs and some of those students<br>never sort of set foot in the parent<br>campus or in the parent country so a<br>very different type of international<br>education one that perhaps is not as<br>valuable for our country<br>but<br>still is of value to<br>the university and of some value to new<br>zealand<br>public funding has been falling behind<br>rising costs each year that's a gap of<br>around about two percent and each year<br>the university has to go out and find a<br>way<br>to plug that two percent gap between the<br>amount of public funding that enters the<br>university and the rising costs of the<br>institution which of course are based<br>primarily around labor costs<br>there's a trend towards desegregation of<br>the research-led teaching nexus that<br>defines universities from for this is to<br>find universities for hundreds of years<br>the idea that you have a research active<br>academic in front of you who is teaching<br>you<br>uh this is a very<br>amazing model it's the best teaching<br>model possible<br>you have those modern days explorers<br>that excite you about your subject areas<br>but unfortunately it's an expensive<br>model and as a result of the public<br>funding that is falling behind there are<br>different questions being asked about<br>whether that's a model that we can<br>sustain into the future<br>you're also seeing the research programs<br>pivot away from being curiosity-led<br>disciplinary based projects into these<br>large multi-disciplinary programs that<br>are mission-led focused on real-world<br>world issues like climate change applied<br>research if you like backed up by<br>deep verticals in the fundamental<br>research that's brought together in that<br>multi-disciplinary complex<br>we're also of course confronting in our<br>country and others decolonization and<br>the increased importance of the<br>culturally responsive pedagogies<br>growing need for accessible lifelong<br>learning which i've touched on already<br>the looming threats from poor planetary<br>stewardship in particular climate change<br>but many other things such as a loss of<br>biodiversity<br>a tremendous rise in mental health<br>challenges amongst our students<br>we've referred to this regularly as a<br>tsunami and that's the way it feels<br>when you are confronting this challenge<br>in a university setting<br>and the inequality induced fractures and<br>social cohesion in our country<br>partly<br>playing out on our parliamentary<br>precinct at the moment<br>partly driven by those type of<br>challenges<br>and then strong headwinds for the<br>elitist self-centered global corporate<br>type of university the university that's<br>all about itself and not about its<br>communities and it's that global civic<br>university that we've spent the last<br>eight years trying to build that<br>university that focuses on its community<br>first<br>and on itself second with a view to<br>sustaining that community and that<br>university through that virtuous cycle<br>of a relationship of a strong community<br>and a strong university<br>so briefly on covert those<br>the covert crisis has sharpened or<br>certainly<br>expanded on many of those challenges<br>i've just mentioned in that strategic<br>context<br>it has caused a large drop in revenue<br>that was exacerbated by<br>the particular challenges of closed<br>borders<br>it forced a rapid change to dual or<br>synchronous online learning again<br>picking up on that challenge of<br>universities moving to this<br>transnational education anyway<br>it resulted in a rethink of our<br>operating model because we did not have<br>the revenue to drive the current model<br>and so we had to think carefully about<br>how we might be more efficient<br>and how we might replace those lost<br>revenues<br>and that led to a few<br>changes that were already in the wings<br>the old idea about good ideas lying<br>around we picked those up and utilized<br>those very quickly that included things<br>like teaching intensive career paths<br>instead of research intensive career<br>paths and the launch of course of<br>wellington uni professional which is our<br>startup company focusing on lifelong<br>learning adult learning and something<br>that we're going to be very proud of in<br>the future as it develops a focus on the<br>lifelong learning needs of of wellington<br>and the wider wellington region<br>on the upside we weren't traveling and<br>so we found that we could our carbon<br>emissions reduce dramatically and we're<br>a long way towards our carbon neutral<br>plan<br>as a result of that simple act of being<br>able to travel less<br>through all of that we've managed to<br>maintain the academic progress of our<br>students which was our number one goal<br>we wanted to make sure that we could<br>predict their progress towards their<br>degrees and<br>overall that has been achieved<br>a lot of support required around the<br>dual learning approach which put a lot<br>of workload pressure on staff but also<br>on technology grants and hardship grants<br>and accommodation discounts and various<br>uh flexible approaches to assignment<br>deliveries and all the all the things<br>that we had to rework to ensure that<br>during that crisis we could keep people<br>going towards their degree<br>despite all those challenges our staff<br>have been marvellous 95 percent of our<br>teachers assist as as good or very good<br>or excellent by the students even during<br>those difficult times of covert<br>we provided fees free study to more than<br>420 wellingtonians whose work and life<br>were disrupted by the pandemic and we<br>did in the end improve the resilience of<br>our operating model opened up new market<br>opportunities by pivoting<br>transnationally into a range of<br>different countries and have returned<br>the university to surplus<br>but please note that was at a cost a<br>cost of about 200<br>full-time jobs through voluntary<br>redundancy<br>and now of course we're in the middle of<br>omicron uh we've gone from a handful of<br>positive cases on friday morning last<br>week to about 640 yesterday in the halls<br>and we're up to about 820 today<br>um<br>that's been a real challenge because<br>that means we've gone from about a<br>thousand sorry gone to it's from people<br>coming to our<br>now dining halls to eat to suddenly<br>having to find ways to feed a thousand<br>people in our halls of residence in<br>their rooms uh isolated to care for them<br>to make sure that they are not<br>misjudging their symptoms<br>uh to find ways to entertain and look<br>after them so that they're not going<br>spare in those rooms so the sudden rise<br>from that small number of cases to 1 000<br>people locked away in their rooms has<br>been quite a challenge<br>not so much from omicron more from the<br>fact that finally we got a hold of our<br>rapid antigen tests and were able to get<br>a true prevalence of<br>the positive cases in our student<br>population<br>we've also developed significant cash<br>reserves to weather this remaining year<br>so that will see the university through<br>this year we've got our vaccine mandates<br>in place all the public health protocols<br>as we need we needed to put in place<br>contingency plans for all of our<br>essential services we had to start up<br>some private diagnostic services once we<br>realized we couldn't rely on the<br>government services to<br>surveil our population their critical<br>services in particular and we've got all<br>of our in-house contact tracing in place<br>the occupation of the pivotal campus has<br>been a further complication because it<br>pressurized all of our facilities and we<br>needed those facilities<br>to be not under pressure so we could<br>achieve the social distancing so that's<br>added to the complexity of things<br>but there is light at the end of the<br>tunnel<br>omicron will peak soon by the look of<br>things in our place within a couple of<br>weeks we are seeing uh firm messages<br>from government about when the borders<br>will reopen and as long as the visa<br>settings are competitive with other<br>countries<br>we should be able to rebuild our<br>international education again and get<br>back to that stage of building that<br>global tolerance of our students by<br>exposing them to<br>people from up to 100 countries which<br>was where we were<br>when we finally had to move into this<br>current border closure situation<br>just a couple of recent highlights<br>from the<br>last few years i just touched on this<br>briefly i won't go into this<br>greatly but<br>it is very important when you're<br>competing with 18 000 other universities<br>in the world<br>included amongst those being the 30 or<br>40 elite university brands that can<br>reach your community that you know what<br>you stand for that you have an identity<br>uh and we have worked hard at that um<br>our identity has it began with a and the<br>picking up the idea from robert stout of<br>being a civic university supporting<br>wellington and the wellington region we<br>revitalized that saying actually modern<br>universities aren't just about our city<br>we want an impact on their world we want<br>our new zealand ideas to be considered<br>and promulgated internationally we want<br>our staff to be world leading and so we<br>coined this term global civic<br>but we've finally come home with the<br>most recent iteration of that and that<br>is a global civic university with our<br>mariah at our heart this is our eho our<br>essence<br>it is solidly supported by the members<br>of our university community and i feel<br>that we have finally coined who we are<br>with that term<br>we aren't just a western institution<br>we're a western institution in new<br>zealand and our bicultural society<br>embedded in that treaty framework that's<br>who we are and that's who we need to<br>live<br>when we talk that when we talk about<br>that essence and we talk about it in our<br>marketing language our positioning if<br>you like in the market we refer to<br>ourselves as new zealand's globally<br>ranked capital city university a phrase<br>um this was touched on briefly by john<br>but our research is flourishing uh we've<br>retained the crown of being the top<br>ranked university for research quality<br>in new zealand<br>uh this is critical as i've mentioned<br>because that brings those latter-day<br>explorers those enthusiasts with the<br>cutting edge of their knowledge into the<br>classrooms<br>giving a world-leading education in our<br>city<br>we've also managed to grow our research<br>and come dramatically from about 32<br>million in 2017 up to 87.4 now<br>that is important because that's a<br>measure of research relevance you don't<br>grow your research revenue unless you're<br>asking the big questions in your<br>disciplines and therefore getting the<br>marsden grants you don't grow your<br>research revenue unless you are<br>undertaking work that solves the<br>problems and captures the opportunities<br>of government of business of society and<br>so this measures research relevance pbrf<br>measures research excellence and we've<br>got both you have a world-class research<br>our teaching too is thriving in spite of<br>those closed borders we've continued to<br>grow we need to grow we need to grow for<br>our city to bring the um<br>talented minds into our our city so that<br>we have access to talented labor uh we<br>also need to grow for the university<br>because we're only just at scale now we<br>need to be<br>probably<br>about a third bigger than we are to be<br>comfortable uh with our<br>with the current funding model in new<br>zealand and so we do have to steadily<br>grow over time to ensure the<br>university's financial sustainability<br>but each time we we add students we add<br>staff and we add our ability to<br>contribute to our country and to our<br>city uh into the research that's<br>required across the world<br>we've been very committed to uh having a<br>role that mimics the society in which we<br>operate<br>uh we now have finally uh reached two<br>thousand maori equivalent full-time<br>students<br>uh that's um equivalent to just under 12<br>of the domestic student role and<br>similarly we're up now at six and a half<br>percent of the role as our pacifica<br>students we still have work to do here<br>uh that's not where we should be as a<br>nationally ranked institution that's<br>around about where the wellington region<br>is<br>but that we still need far significant<br>uh increases over on our maori and<br>pacific enrolments to mimic the national<br>demographics around us which is our goal<br>why are we thriving in our teaching well<br>the key reasons is that<br>the students who come here love not just<br>the university but they love our city<br>it's that combined experience that draws<br>students to our city<br>we also have been being able to expand<br>the the subject offerings that we offer<br>so we meet subject-area preferences and<br>and the notable thing here has been the<br>growth of engineering<br>yes we have an engineering faculty here<br>we have an amazing engineering faculty<br>here but most people in wellington still<br>would not be aware of that and of course<br>the addition of the new faculty of<br>health which is going great guns and<br>that broadens the choices students can<br>make<br>this institution has always been very<br>good at providing the flexibility to<br>students 70 percent of our students who<br>arrive here in the first year do not<br>know what will inspire their future<br>they're still searching for themselves<br>they're still searching for the subjects<br>that will be the things that will<br>inspire their next career and their life<br>from here<br>we provide them the flexibility to<br>explore and to discover that and when<br>they do look out you see them just<br>thrive once they've struck that area<br>that inspires them<br>we also work to find this very difficult<br>balance between the employment readiness<br>required by employers<br>but the future employability required by<br>a graduate that is going to spend 40<br>years in the workforce and of course<br>those are two different things<br>and the idea of citizenship<br>and universities feel very strongly<br>about that but particularly this<br>university<br>our job is not just employment ready<br>graduates it's also citizens who<br>participate in a democratic society who<br>are global citizens and understand<br>what's happening in the world<br>to do all of that we have a mantra<br>around not just cultivating intellectual<br>capital i.e knowledge<br>but also social capital and that<br>creative capital that comes from being<br>challenged in the lectures challenged in<br>the tutorials challenged in in in our<br>city and being part of that creative and<br>entrepreneurial city that we have a<br>privilege to work in here<br>one thing for the future that i've<br>i've challenged john with us he touched<br>on<br>we are now working through taking that<br>eho that essence of being a global civic<br>university with our mariah at our heart<br>and saying how does that translate to<br>our graduate outcomes and our curriculum<br>how are we going to ensure that all of<br>our graduates have a knowledge of today<br>maori<br>of the treaty the history of troa<br>throughout our curriculum and so that's<br>a big challenge<br>one that will be an interested bystander<br>watching from the sidelines<br>at the heart of a civic university is<br>engagement and partnerships i'm proud of<br>the progress we've made on on on this<br>with our city and our region and with<br>people and organizations across the<br>world<br>there are far too many to mention but<br>just to give you a flavor of that the<br>miramar creative center in the film<br>industry in in wellington<br>the taihana partnership program we now<br>have signed agreements with 80 ewe and<br>eb related organizations where we<br>co-fund<br>scholarships teaching initiatives<br>research initiatives with those ewe and<br>that's by far the most successful<br>partnering program<br>with euwe across our nation it's a<br>fantastic achievement<br>that rohini higgins and her team have<br>created<br>for our university and for our community<br>our alumni have got together in the<br>innovation booster partnership with<br>wellington uni ventures to fund some of<br>the intellectual property that comes out<br>of the university so it takes root in<br>wellington this is critical local<br>funding helps the ideas generated<br>generate here go into local startups and<br>employ local people and continue to<br>develop the city from here the wonderful<br>partnership with the malignant institute<br>that's long standing a fundamental<br>science partnership that's played a very<br>important role in the management of the<br>covet epidemic here<br>and internationally where we're in<br>partner partnership with berkeley around<br>ensuring a good student experience for<br>research intensive universities we're in<br>the harvard mit led edx program<br>which is the<br>a platform whereby now 60 universities<br>provide international online education<br>and share each other's<br>courses<br>and numerous offshore universities the<br>one i'll pick out is just a relationship<br>with a university in beijing<br>which allows us now to have a study<br>center in beijing to support that<br>transnational education and provide<br>pastoral care to our students offshore<br>that i touched on earlier on<br>and another thing that's been very<br>important to me and that is ensuring<br>that we get the voice of our academics<br>as an engaged university<br>in to the public discourse and so<br>through that to achieve that we've<br>developed partnerships with the newsroom<br>and of course the conversation and that<br>those those opportunities have been<br>been our staff have availed themselves<br>of and we are much more present in those<br>conversations than we used to be<br>i mentioned the challenges of the<br>environmental future we are going to be<br>at zero carbon university by 2030 uh net<br>car<br>net zero that'll include a 40 reduction<br>in our gross emissions in that short<br>period of time we're well on the journey<br>it's not just the air travel that i<br>mentioned but switching out our boilers<br>from gas boilers to electrical use use<br>of offset to buy our time buy us time to<br>make those changes<br>and in sitting through<br>the<br>development we hope of a carbon forest<br>which will be coming to john's council<br>in the not too distant future as one of<br>the new initiatives to help us get to<br>carbon zero that's an indigenous forest<br>of<br>up to 600 hectares to to help us on this<br>our facilities of course are improving<br>as well a massive capital renewal<br>program helped by that controversial uh<br>corollary campus sale we're able to<br>reinvest that in our scholarship<br>programs and in<br>strengthening our buildings and<br>modernizing our building and getting<br>onto the leaky roofs that were plaguing<br>our staff<br>and of course you see the signature<br>programs such as as those that many of<br>you have been involved with who are on<br>national music center in civic square<br>with the wellington city council in nz<br>so<br>we are planning still uh that new<br>engineering and science precinct and<br>access route uh to calvin through 320<br>the terrace i'll come back to that<br>briefly in a moment the living par<br>developments<br>to underpin physically this idea of<br>having the mirai at the heart of the<br>campus and our commitment to<br>sustainability<br>and of course for our pacifica community<br>getting behind<br>the<br>the farley trust<br>that a number of you on the school are<br>involved in to ensure that we can anchor<br>this city's<br>role uh in the pacifica uh communities<br>of new zealand but also in the pacifica<br>uh communities of uh the wider pacific<br>that we<br>are part of so this is an amazing and<br>inspiring project that i'm sure<br>will eventually get across the ground on<br>our waterfront here<br>national music center i won't say much<br>about you probably will know about it<br>but i'm very pleased with progress now<br>we are now masters of our own destiny we<br>can get on and get this done<br>our council has signed off on the<br>investment required<br>and through kerry and the foundation we<br>have raised<br>very significant funds<br>to ensure that<br>we are able to complete this project<br>without<br>making the university destitute so thank<br>you very much gary for that<br>um the terrace this is what the<br>design of the building looks like and we<br>do hope to still achieve this<br>we have been set back by the<br>heritage status that was recently<br>accorded to the gordon wilson flats<br>but we are working through that and we<br>do do still intend to be in the<br>environment caught in the not too<br>distant future<br>with a view to demolishing that building<br>so that we can begin to create<br>front door for the university<br>on the<br>edge of the city<br>enlivening that edge<br>but also providing this pathway through<br>to the university that's a safe pathway<br>for our students and staff to get up to<br>the kelvin campus<br>and then getting near the end folks just<br>a a big thanks to our alumni and friends<br>um we have a very generous alumni and<br>friends group<br>when we got when i got to the university<br>we were um plotting away at this making<br>uh steady progress but we did decide uh<br>with the ambition of the council at the<br>time to launch a campaign<br>we targeted a hundred million dollars<br>and a given that was our first campaign<br>we've had to stretch that stretch target<br>up to 150 and this year we will hit 150<br>million dollars<br>raised<br>by<br>and from the members of our alumni and<br>friends group in wellington and new<br>zealand and around the world<br>so that's a very inspiring thing for<br>staff<br>uh and students to see the uh the<br>investment uh and and through that<br>investment the investment in the public<br>good<br>mission of a university<br>but to see the fact that people care<br>about uh students and about their<br>futures and about the research that we<br>do and the issues that we're confronting<br>so beyond the money<br>it's the fact that people are caring<br>about our mission caring about our<br>purpose and caring about those students<br>and staff so thank you very much for<br>that and thank you to all of all of you<br>who contributed<br>your own investments into those outcomes<br>then lastly we're coming up to 125 years<br>in december this year<br>i am confident that this university will<br>thrive into the next 125 years<br>and i'm sure that the city and region<br>will continue to benefit from the<br>incredible staff and students of this<br>institution<br>who year in year out enrich the life of<br>our capital<br>and that wider region and simply make<br>this world a better place so thank you<br>very much<br>that was all i wanted to say thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
