did you study<br>at university and how did it prepare for<br>the real world i started with a bachelor<br>of science down here at otago university<br>and that gave me the opportunity to<br>work out what i wanted to do and<br>and to learn quite a lot about the<br>techniques and disciplines behind<br>science<br>that's been part of what i've used in my<br>career i then did a bachelor of commerce<br>and entered the sort of commercial world<br>after that<br>on the way through i've always kept on<br>studying so gone to other universities<br>overseas<br>to sharpen up my knowledge<br>so the original<br>degree<br>gave me lots of disciplines about how to<br>manage and do things and the other thing<br>to note was it allowed me to meet a lot<br>of people that have become lifelong<br>friends and actually i've helped them<br>and they've helped me in my career<br>you serve on a number of boards how did<br>you establish yourself as a director and<br>what are your key responsibilities i was<br>quite fortunate when i came back to new<br>zealand in 1988 that the company i<br>started up was an investment bank and<br>i had arranged with my<br>employers from australia<br>to be allowed to do one governance role<br>beside my ceo role in the investment<br>bank and i did that for the 21 years i<br>was the ceo<br>my first<br>official role was an appointment by the<br>government onto the auckland district<br>health board which was renamed auckland<br>healthcare and is now called the<br>auckland district health board<br>and so um i i sort of was very lucky to<br>get into governance at the age of 30 and<br>have been in it ever since uh in terms<br>of<br>a director and and what you do that's a<br>big question the clearly the governance<br>of an organization whether you're a<br>director or the chair is the single most<br>important thing<br>the roles have changed over time but the<br>what has remained constant is your job<br>is to govern the company set the<br>strategy<br>get the people working together doing it<br>what's changed a lot is the various<br>calls on accompanied by stakeholders now<br>have to be met by that company and the<br>directors have to make sure that those<br>things happen in the very old days<br>really the focus was on only on<br>shareholders and outcomes nowadays it's<br>customers community your social license<br>to operate and all of the other inputs<br>that go into your company so it's quite<br>a it's it's forever changing in terms of<br>the role of a director in some ways<br>how do you see the insurance sector<br>addressing the risks of climate change<br>well the refining new zealand board has<br>been reporting on<br>carbon and emissions for quite some time<br>now<br>also as a company because it is a<br>company that's heavily exposed in those<br>areas<br>they have spent a lot of money over the<br>last 10 years upgrading facilities to<br>reduce the carbon footprint of the<br>company<br>we will absolutely report to any<br>required reporting standards uh in the<br>future and totally committed the second<br>or third point is that the um<br>refining new zealand has announced a<br>strategic review of what they're doing<br>and how they're doing it and that is in<br>part in relation to the carbon footprint<br>and climate change that review is in<br>conjunction with customers<br>and staff and everyone and we're<br>pursuing that strategic review as we<br>speak<br>how is the insurance sector addressing<br>the increased risk to physical assets<br>due to climate change<br>well that is at the heart of insurance<br>and we are heavily involved in<br>assessing climate change effect um what<br>we do is we ensure the physical assets<br>of the people of australia and new<br>zealand and iag is the largest insurer<br>in australia and the largest insurer in<br>new zealand<br>what we have<br>observed and we agree that the climate<br>change effect in the long term is going<br>to see things like<br>water level rising it would surprise a<br>lot of people to know that by the end of<br>the century on accepted science<br>120 000 houses in new zealand will be<br>inundated with water<br>unless<br>society adapts and mitigates the risks<br>to those houses<br>we have quite a strong public program<br>now of educating local government and<br>government<br>that<br>they should move<br>re start moving reasonably quickly on<br>adaptation and mitigation of issues<br>relating to climate change now in the<br>shorter term which affects insurance<br>companies more year by year<br>six out of new zealand's seven most<br>expensive<br>weather events<br>not including earthquakes have actually<br>occurred in the last seven years so the<br>frequency and severity of those types of<br>events<br>has gone up and that does go to how an<br>insurer responds to it but firstly<br>with price and with other levers<br>but again i come back to the insurance<br>industry in conjunction with the people<br>has to<br>make sure that we mitigate<br>and reduce risk and reduce losses so<br>that we don't end up having to pay too<br>much for insuring those assets in the<br>future<br>you have been involved in many<br>government and industry collaborations<br>which role was the most challenging and<br>why probably the most rewarding and the<br>most challenging and the biggest was the<br>establishment of crown fiber holdings as<br>chair back in 2009 and building the<br>ultrafast broadband network to<br>most of the houses of new zealand and<br>that was a very rewarding but<br>challenging<br>exercise because it involved<br>civil works of over six billion dollars<br>building that network out to new zealand<br>our organization designed a process<br>which procured the private sector<br>to build that network what are your<br>three most important life lessons<br>first one is<br>enjoy<br>and and nurture<br>the people that you work with and play<br>with<br>and in the work environment the people<br>are the most important thing to you<br>whether you're working for them with<br>them or they're working for you and more<br>and more it's a team effort<br>in terms of outcomes<br>the second thing is i spend a lot of<br>time planning uh and planning means in a<br>company sense strategy and planning in a<br>personal sense it's planning<br>and if it's not planned it sort of might<br>not happen<br>um included in the planning is<br>creating optionality so we're not when<br>when things come along or opportunities<br>come along<br>you are able to grab them and that's<br>that's really valuable and maybe the<br>other thing is you've got to work hard<br>and play hard and<br>and<br>have a reasonable amount of work life<br>balance<br>what keeps you awake at night<br>uh it's a different answer<br>today from when i was young<br>when i was young i would worry about<br>everything all of all the time<br>i've probably got so many things to<br>worry about nowadays that i<br>i do<br>not stay awake about individual things<br>unless there's actually a crisis on<br>um<br>if there's a crisis on yeah i'll worry<br>about it if if if the staff are at risk<br>from a health and safety perspective or<br>there's been a<br>major<br>problem in a company that i'm involved<br>in then i will it will affect me but one<br>of the main techniques is to make sure<br>that i do get a reasonable amount of<br>exercise which means that helps me sleep<br>at night who do you admire and why<br>it's not one person it's it's a group of<br>people<br>that took the internet to the world and<br>the<br>and the techniques and the machinery<br>that uses the internet because in my<br>view it's like a modern day industrial<br>revolution we take them for granted<br>today and we're only 30 years in from<br>the internet starting up and they<br>really do<br>have my great greatest<br>how do you find balance between work and<br>personal commitments<br>nowadays i<br>plan for<br>time out plan for<br>time with the family plan for<br>time away<br>when i was your age i didn't have<br>work-life balance i just worked once<br>once i went to<br>and got a job i worked and<br>yes did a bit of exercise but<br>work-life balance wasn't<br>a focus actually of employers in those<br>days but it also wasn't<br>a focus for you know groups of us that<br>were working very very long hours so<br>i've been through both phases of no<br>work-life balance through to proper<br>work-life balance i retired from<br>full-time<br>uh employment in the<br>in in 2009 so<br>since then as a governor of companies<br>i'm able to plan<br>my time a lot better than<br>you can when you're working very long<br>hours full time<br>and i enjoy it and and<br>and<br>plan regularly on new things to do<br>what advice would you like to give to<br>students at otago i think you will find<br>when you're<br>old that you'll look back on this time<br>as one of the greatest parts of your<br>life it's the beginning of your learning<br>journey it's not the end of your<br>learning journey and so<br>your next phases<br>when you're going to work or whatever<br>you're doing<br>you'll continue to learn one of the<br>things you hopefully have got out of<br>being here as a hunger for learning<br>and that turns into you finding the<br>areas of passion the passion the things<br>you like doing and if you find those<br>and you work hard at them<br>it's very hard not to succeed<br>and so<br>my lesson is search for those things<br>that really interest you<br>leverage off all your friends and your<br>people on the way through because they<br>will help you more than you think<br>and uh and with that passion and that<br>effort and the learnings you've got<br>and the people<br>you know life should be pretty good<br>thank you very much simon for coming to<br>chat to us and for sharing your<br>knowledge and insights and all the best<br>for the rest of your year and hopefully<br>we keep in touch cheers thank you and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
