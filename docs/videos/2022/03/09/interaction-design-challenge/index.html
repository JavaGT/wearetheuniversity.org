We are challenging you to create a digital version of a physical interaction such as a high five, a tap on the shoulder, or a hug.  You can submit screen mock-ups, a video or a storyboard of the interaction, you don't have to actually make it work.<br><br>Submit photos or videos of your designs to YouTube, Instagram, or Twitter using #futuredesignersnz for full details about the competition, go to our website: https://futuredesigners.nz/interaction-design/<br> <br>Detailed instructions, terms & conditions and info about prizes on https://futuredesigners.nz <br> <br>Future Designers is a design community for New Zealand high school students & teachers hosted by the School of Design Innovation. <br><br>Study design at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington: https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/explore/study-...</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>For this competition, we're challenging you to  <br>make a digital version of a <br>physical interaction such as<br>a high five a tap on the shoulder or even a hug<br>your digital interaction doesn't <br>have to replicate the physical one<br>but it should have the same <br>sentiment and the same use<br>so take for example tapping someone on the <br>shoulder you can do that quickly or urgently.  <br>You can do that in a gentle way but you want <br>to replicate both getting someone's attention  <br>and the emotion that you're using <br>with how you're tapping the shoulder  <br>in the digital interaction. You don't <br>even have to show a hand or a shoulder  <br>it's just that emotion and the use that <br>you would use that interaction for. <br>You can use any of the features of your <br>phone or a computer to make your interaction.  <br>You can think about vibration, you can <br>think about the lights, you can think  <br>about visualizations on the screen. Anything <br>to get your interaction across to your user.  <br>You can design your interaction <br>You can design your interaction<br>to be for an existing app or platform or <br>it can be a whole new app based around your<br>interaction. We want to know what <br>physical interaction you're replicating  <br>the more unique it is to your friend group the <br>better. We're also interested in what your new  <br>interaction looks like, feels like, and sounds <br>like. Now you don't actually have to make it  <br>you can draw it in storyboards you can do screen <br>mockups to show us what it would look like  <br>or you can fake a video of how that <br>interaction would feel and look.<br>Post your designs on Instagram Youtube or Twitter<br>Or email us at futuredesigners@vuw.ac.nz<br>We look forward to seeing your designs</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
