i'd got<br>this award and<br>uh neil knew i got the award as well but<br>it wasn't made public and<br>it had to be officially released and i<br>was driving to raglan and i came back i<br>got a stone chip in the window<br>and so i went to get the next day the um<br>window replaced<br>and i went in and the guy was like doing<br>that thing he looks at the window and he<br>goes doesn't look good it's going to be<br>expensive and lucky he knew it had to be<br>a replacement window he said just sit<br>down over there and i'll work out the<br>cost and so i went and sat down over<br>there and as i'd sat down i opened my<br>phone<br>and um neil had released the information<br>that i'd been made critical conscience<br>and in the process of that that space of<br>time there was like a hundred emails of<br>people who were just expressing their<br>admiration their<br>support their love and i got a bit<br>tearful because and then the guy looks<br>over at me and he goes don't worry it's<br>not that bad<br>and<br>like i it was like one of those moments<br>we were just on different planes and i<br>said but i'm the critic and conscience<br>of society<br>um i have to begin with a a series of<br>thank yous uh first of all um my wife<br>claire<br>uh my children jamie connor and renee<br>my wider family<br>my friends<br>uh and most of all i must think tonight<br>that the gamma foundation which provided<br>the support and the<br>award which i was lucky enough to<br>receive<br>what i'm going to do tonight is<br>talk for a little bit but mainly get<br>questions because people hear me talk<br>all the time<br>and so i'm just going to plant a few<br>ideas and then hopefully<br>get questions from the audience<br>for those who are pre-tick-tock<br>generation that thing up there that<br>little square if you put your phone at<br>it it this actually works i've tried it<br>take a photo of it and you can send me a<br>question and the question will come up<br>here straight away afterwards i'll put<br>that up again at the end so i'm just<br>going to hit a few topics about<br>what i'm thinking about because where i<br>am today is considerably different to<br>where i was six months ago when this<br>talk was first planned<br>this world is changing so fast<br>so first of all the idea of the critic<br>and conscience of society it's a<br>it is as neil said it's something which<br>is in the education act and it's<br>something that we want the academics to<br>do whereby we are<br>where we are somewhat of a compass point<br>where we can sort of like say we think<br>this is right or this is wrong<br>we only exist because of the privileged<br>position that we have<br>whereby society supports the<br>universities<br>the universities support us<br>and we can then in my case try to call<br>it irrespective of whether it's left<br>wing or right wing or red blue or green<br>we just try to say it as we see fit<br>but importantly this possibility<br>is only viable when you have support<br>from university and in that regard i<br>must acknowledge the support of neil in<br>particular because there are times when<br>the<br>when you speak out publicly you'll be<br>amazed how much hate you get and<br>sometimes the hate can be vitriolic and<br>quite threatening but the university's<br>always had my back and i'd like to<br>acknowledge that<br>so<br>things i'm going to talk about i'm only<br>going to talk about<br>two things and<br>and this is kind of the topics that are<br>occupying my brain at the moment<br>and<br>it's<br>i can't remember what i was doing three<br>years ago<br>it's kind of like if i had gone to a<br>fortune teller and said to her tell me<br>what the future's going to be and she<br>looks in the crystal ball and she says<br>there's going to be two terror attacks<br>there's going to be a global pandemic<br>which is going to completely gridlock<br>the country and then russia's gonna<br>invade the ukraine i'd say i want my<br>money back<br>i i wouldn't believe the the world that<br>we've ended up in<br>it's all changing so much sometimes i'm<br>almost scared to turn on the news to see<br>what happens next it's a difficult age<br>and i spend a lot of time trying to<br>reassure my students and younger people<br>that this is just a phase that we're<br>going through but it is it is difficult<br>but the first topic um<br>i've been<br>writing on and working on<br>since it broke<br>is covert 19<br>and the<br>whole idea of what happened to our<br>society<br>that if there's one word that you need<br>to think about with this it's emergency<br>it's a it was a pandemic a global<br>pandemic<br>and our generation had never had to<br>experience that kind of<br>tension or fear or choices<br>previous generations have gone through<br>it ours hadn't and then it hit us and we<br>had to respond with emergency<br>legislation<br>whereby everything that we were used to<br>had to change and change quickly where<br>the government had to act for the<br>collective good as opposed to the<br>individual and we all had to become<br>experts in science<br>and trying to understand a lot of<br>different rules<br>as they came about us<br>things like isolation things like who<br>would have thought the word miq would be<br>one of those woods you would know<br>or the idea of mask wearing<br>or the idea of vaccination<br>all of a sudden we were thrown into a<br>very different world<br>and the<br>the position for me was one was were the<br>restrictions justified<br>were they something that was legitimate<br>and everything came down to the bill of<br>rights act<br>and what we could reasonably demonstrate<br>as justifiable than a free and<br>democratic society<br>and so our country for two years has had<br>to balance<br>our freedoms of association<br>a number of freedoms of choice limits on<br>considerations of vaccines<br>and we've had to to struggle through<br>and that that's been difficult that that<br>has been difficult and the i think the<br>culmination of that period is what we<br>saw in wellington last week<br>whereby we saw a type of protest which<br>was something which was<br>unprecedented in this country protest is<br>it's part of who we are as kiwis we we<br>all protest we've all done it we've all<br>been somewhere<br>but the way that this one was different<br>was in the the vitriol<br>the death threats to politicians to<br>journalists<br>and then the occupation of parliament<br>and so previously we've had protested<br>occupation but they were always on<br>disputed land land that belonged to<br>maori that this was parliament was<br>something which belonged to us and it<br>was kind of odd because like as a group<br>we generally don't even like freedom<br>campers yet all of a sudden there were<br>these people there that were just trying<br>to occupy our parliament<br>and so even though we need to protect<br>the freedom of protest which i firmly<br>believe and we must be as tolerant as<br>possible<br>protests can only ever be protected when<br>it is both orderly and peaceful<br>and yet what we're starting to see is<br>that boundary shifting so the<br>government's got a whole lot of work to<br>do there i mean i'm not an expert on how<br>to find rabbit holes or block them up<br>but that's part of the work but the<br>other part of the work we've got to do<br>is show<br>less<br>less tolerance to people who say they're<br>going to kill you<br>we need to be rethinking about the way<br>that we use parliament because<br>parliament to me there are two sacred<br>sites in new zealand one treaty of<br>waitangi grounds two parliament we don't<br>recognize parliament as that kind of<br>area which should be recognized for its<br>national significance<br>because it wasn't just that protest it's<br>where<br>women got the vote i think of the land<br>marches i think of the anti-nuclear<br>marches i think with the seabed and four<br>shore marches it's part of our democracy<br>yet what we saw down there was a<br>transgression of that so we're gonna<br>have to go back to think about what's<br>going on<br>one of the things i've been arguing uh<br>with professor breen is that what we<br>need is a royal commission<br>and<br>we we argue for a royal commission not<br>not because we think that the<br>government's done a bad job i think the<br>government's done a great job if i'm<br>honest and when i say a great job the<br>criteria i use for that<br>is that out of 6 million deaths globally<br>there's only been 65 in new zealand and<br>to me that's the bottom line with how<br>you judge success or failure is how many<br>kiwis died and most kiwis didn't die<br>but apart from that we've gone through<br>this period whereby<br>miq kiwis couldn't come home and so what<br>we've been arguing for is that we we<br>take a step back not because we think<br>the government did good or bad<br>but there will be more pandemics and i<br>believe that the goal for this<br>government now should be to get the<br>lessons correct for the next generation<br>because the uncertainty we have is that<br>this will occur again and we need a<br>stock take to see what worked and what<br>didn't<br>the last time of course we did this was<br>after the 1918 pandemic and that that<br>was a a complete disaster and that one<br>nearly 8 800 kiwis died and so they had<br>the influenza<br>epidemic commission and they same thing<br>they came in they looked at the<br>situation they looked at the<br>considerations of uh<br>murray settlements quarantine masks<br>ventilation health education kind of<br>sounds like today and i just said this<br>worked this didn't work this spot needs<br>to change and then the law changed and<br>in that generation with this health act<br>built on subsequent ones and so that's<br>what we're advocating now so it's<br>irrespective of whether we did right or<br>wrong it's how can we do better for the<br>future because that's coming<br>but the other thing that i'm working on<br>and this goes to the picture in the top<br>corner and that's the international<br>sphere and i've been working with um sir<br>peter glockman and sir jim mcclay on<br>this<br>and this is the international response<br>because the challenge here is no matter<br>how good we are at home at our own<br>self-isolation we're only a very small<br>corner of the world<br>and so the international negotiations<br>which started last week on a new<br>pandemic treaty is where some of my<br>energy is going<br>now the problem here is that we've had<br>international rules on how to<br>deal with pandemics how to share<br>information how to give early<br>notification there's something bad<br>coming close your border since 1851 and<br>every generation another pandemic<br>happens we change the law<br>and then we we add one and so like after<br>again the spanish flu there's a new<br>convention and the one we've got now is<br>from 2005 and they're called the the<br>international health regulations<br>and the the amazing thing about them is<br>they look really cool on paper<br>but the problem was was that even though<br>we had all this great international law<br>and all of these really strong sovereign<br>obligations<br>we missed somewhere between four to five<br>weeks before the<br>the birth of the disease and before the<br>time it was noted by the world health<br>organization<br>and we're never going to get to the<br>point where you can reduce risk to zero<br>all we can argue about is trying to get<br>a better time response<br>and so now we're in a process of trying<br>to negotiate what that looks like<br>but it's hard<br>and one of the main reasons it's hard is<br>that the there were three individuals<br>involved in warning<br>humanity about covert 19. there was a<br>chinese scientist there was a canadian<br>scientist and there was an australian<br>scientist and there was a there's<br>actually two chinese scientists but the<br>whole process happened<br>outside of state-based responsibilities<br>it was individuals who triggered it and<br>so we're trying to have a situation now<br>where governments and states control<br>things<br>but the world through the internet and<br>globalization and individuals move much<br>quicker<br>and trying to reconcile these two things<br>in a new treaty<br>is very hard<br>so that's<br>one half of my brain and trying to work<br>out what's best for new zealand how we<br>can deal with covert 19 how can we can<br>stop this in the future because that<br>we<br>we know<br>zoonotic that zoonotic is a fancy word<br>for disease that jumps from an animal<br>what we know this is increasing we know<br>our proximity is increasing we know the<br>speed of them generating<br>is increasing we know it's coming but<br>our law and our policy is reactive it's<br>not predictive<br>we're at a point where we have the<br>science where we can pretty much say we<br>think that's going to come out over here<br>but we're not linking it up we're not<br>linking together the people who are<br>experts on plants with the people who<br>are experts on animals with the people<br>who are experts on human disease we can<br>do it but the global cooperation<br>is proving problematic<br>so that's one thing that keeps me awake<br>at night<br>now here's the other one<br>the this<br>it's really strange because sort of like<br>six months ago when i was planning this<br>talk i was going to talk to you about<br>china<br>and i was going to talk to you about<br>human rights in china and how we should<br>be concerned and respond to allegations<br>about genocide<br>and i was going to talk to you about<br>taiwan<br>and the difficulties that we deal with<br>and how we respond to taiwan<br>and then this happened<br>how do you respond i<br>for someone who i have as neil said i've<br>written a lot of books i know a lot<br>about war and history<br>and<br>what happened when putin's tanks rolled<br>over<br>into the ukraine is unprecedented<br>because you've got a superpower<br>that directly violated the obligations<br>of the u.n charter not interfere<br>militarily in another country<br>it his tanks went right over the top of<br>it<br>and so all of a sudden<br>we find<br>how do you respond to this threat and<br>many of you will know your history and<br>many of you will start thinking this<br>reminds me of world war ii you know like<br>poland 1939 munich 38 some of you are<br>thinking belgium 1914<br>and this<br>man has just put all of the most basic<br>fundamentals of international law into<br>the bin<br>we've had invasions before you can think<br>of saddam hussein in 1991 small dictator<br>not really entertaining not really that<br>important but that this kind of thing is<br>different<br>and so what he's done now is introduced<br>what we would call the the lawless world<br>where and for a small country like us<br>this is critical because we rely on law<br>and order we can't survive without law<br>and order we need it to for our economic<br>prosperity we need it for our trade we<br>need it for our social relations our<br>diplomatic relations<br>yet what putin's done and this my<br>concern here is not just what's happened<br>with the ukraine but what happens next<br>if you look into the top corner one of<br>the pictures i've actually highlighted<br>there it's a little panda bear in yellow<br>and<br>if there was a couple of sleepless<br>nights 12 nights ago that i had it was<br>what was china going to do<br>because we were in a point whereby in<br>terms of<br>military strategy it would have been the<br>perfect time to strike if you were going<br>to strike<br>and we've already know that that china's<br>been very direct about how it views<br>taiwan<br>but the great news is is that china<br>didn't china has sat on the fence and<br>that's the best we can hope for and<br>right now they're kind of they're not<br>going to do sanctions against putin but<br>on the other hand they haven't said what<br>he's done is okay<br>so that then throws us to sort of like<br>well what do we do as kiwis how do we<br>respond to this<br>and this is a hard topic because kiwis<br>by nature are quite<br>removed from the rest of the world we<br>know our geographical limit we know<br>where we are and so we don't want to<br>think that maybe we have to do something<br>more<br>today um<br>parliament unanimously has created a new<br>sanctions bill<br>and what this means is is that we are<br>now going to start putting sanctions on<br>a number of russians and russian<br>entities that are connected to the<br>military effort or connected to mr putin<br>and for a country like new zealand<br>that's difficult because our whole<br>foreign policy focus for the last 30<br>years has been through the united<br>nations and so the un would say um<br>al-qaeda they're bad guys these are the<br>particular the rotten apples of all of<br>them this is who you're going to target<br>this is how you're going to do it this<br>is where you're going to do it by<br>and we would follow the u.n process<br>and now we can't do that and we can't do<br>that because the whole un process worked<br>through the security council and that<br>gentleman there on the left has got a<br>big stamp that says veto<br>and so the u.n the security council is<br>now gridlocked<br>and for a country like us it means that<br>we have to start thinking<br>what does our security look like outside<br>of the u.n<br>and we have to think of our friends and<br>our allies<br>and for many kiwis these are<br>conversations we haven't had since 1945<br>but we have to start thinking about who<br>are those who have the same values as us<br>the same things that we're willing to<br>defend and how to do it<br>so we've got the new law and the refugee<br>law not the review the sanctions law<br>looks good<br>as a rule and it's important this does<br>not develop into anti-russian hysteria<br>there's many excellent russian people<br>out there<br>but right now there's a<br>misapprehension that all russians are<br>bad and it's not true there's many<br>russians that we should support we're<br>trying to stand up to putin<br>and it also means that when it comes to<br>sanctions here<br>it must be done fairly and with due<br>process and as transparently as possible<br>just because someone is wealthy and from<br>russia doesn't necessarily mean that<br>we've got a difficult debate one of the<br>things i've been arguing for is that we<br>should give military aid to the<br>ukrainians<br>when<br>that one<br>terrible mistake would be if there were<br>boots on the ground if there's any nato<br>boots in the ukraine if there's any<br>no-fly zone<br>made by nato aircraft we will be in<br>world war iii and so we can't do that we<br>can't put boots on the ground<br>we can't let nato planes defend the<br>airspace we have to watch this terrible<br>situation the sequence of war crimes<br>that happens before our eyes we can't<br>intervene but we can still give them the<br>weapons to defend themselves<br>and other countries in america britain<br>canada australia have all given over<br>kit military kit for the ukrainians to<br>defend themselves and i've been trying<br>to argue that<br>military kit comes in two forms it comes<br>in lethal and non-lethal what i've been<br>arguing is that give the ukrainians body<br>armor give them helmets give them<br>communications equipment give them food<br>packs give them something<br>it's not a question of scale we can't<br>support the ukrainian army we're we're<br>petite but we can give a crate to<br>australia and then the australians can<br>carry it over for us<br>right now the symbolism of standing up<br>for a country in support of its<br>integrity its autonomy its sovereignty<br>and its freedom is uppermost<br>but people don't like these discussions<br>many people think right now let's just<br>leave this alone let's just pretend it's<br>not happening it is happening<br>and there's two other questions we've<br>got to consider as well for the ukraine<br>the first one<br>what are you going to do about the<br>refugees<br>people are so tired of this conversation<br>but we are in a global catastrophe right<br>now we've got refugee numbers at a<br>global peak we've never been desired<br>before<br>we managed to get through afghanistan<br>but we didn't open our doors then<br>because we've already increased our<br>quota to 1500 people per year<br>we've got one of the lowest per capita<br>refugee intakes in the world<br>it's easy to talk about giving aid but<br>it's hard to let people in<br>and so we've said no to afghanistan but<br>now you've got the ukraine<br>and you've got the biggest escape of<br>people<br>1.7 million people in 12 days<br>it's insane<br>and it could go to five it could go to<br>seven million we have to think how do we<br>respond to that as a community<br>we are a country of so much wealth and<br>prosperity and space<br>but we have our own social costs that<br>we're going to have to balance<br>and then the second thing we're going to<br>have to work out now<br>is what do you do with the volunteers<br>who want to go and fight<br>we<br>know i i know people have already<br>contacted me not to fight i'm too old<br>but<br>but they've been saying to me what would<br>happen if i went to go and fight over<br>there<br>and the answer is legally i don't know<br>and the reason i don't know is because<br>we've got two bits of legislation in<br>this country the first one is you can't<br>be a mercenary which means you can't<br>volunteer as a kiwi to go and fight in a<br>foreign conflict and get paid above and<br>beyond what a normal soldier would get<br>the second one is the foreign fighters<br>bill and so for the last five years<br>we've been trying to stop the foreign<br>terror fighters from going to join syria<br>or iraq and cause mayhem and then come<br>back but now we've got this third<br>category of person<br>they may be russian they may be<br>ukrainian if they've got dual<br>nationality they can fight but then<br>there's the other option of just kiwis<br>who want to join the conflict because<br>they feel so upset by what they've seen<br>we haven't been in this position since<br>1937 in the spanish civil war<br>and at that point a number of kiwis went<br>to fight<br>and the government could either have<br>stopped them or turn a blind eye<br>but this is the other area now that the<br>so<br>it's uh so here's the conclusion and<br>we're gonna have to start<br>i'll okay<br>the i'll give you your your question<br>i'm sorry it's got so difficult if it<br>was up to me it wouldn't be this bad i<br>keep trying to tell the young people i<br>miss monica lewinsky and they go who's<br>monica lewinsky<br>and and<br>that there was that kind of time when<br>international relations was just about<br>bill clinton and his<br>episodes<br>and and you've gone from that period<br>when we were looking at a almost utopian<br>society<br>where the cold war was over where we<br>were healthy and prosper and we could<br>feel prosperity and we thought<br>everything was going to be good looking<br>forward right now i see this glass half<br>full glass half empty<br>for a country like new zealand this is<br>difficult because<br>to my mind<br>we have to keep one eye on what's<br>important here<br>and we have to keep one eye on the<br>international world because we can't do<br>any<br>more or deal with it just by ourselves<br>and so there's a consciousness that's<br>required<br>that will take this generation down a<br>very long road ahead<br>and so<br>so<br>this is for the questions and this is<br>cool you should really try it it's quite<br>so the the first question is do i expect<br>to see china play a role in mediating<br>between russia and the ukraine and peace<br>talks<br>and extend the mbs soft<br>power as a major player in that sphere<br>um<br>i think the answer is maybe i think<br>china has a role to play my expectation<br>is that china right now is<br>right on the fence trying to work out<br>which way it's going to orientate itself<br>the problem with the mediation<br>if it's not china it's likely to either<br>be france and germany who i would put my<br>money on or it could be israel as well<br>but the problem with the mediation isn't<br>who is the mediator it's what are the<br>terms of the agreement<br>and so right now<br>putin before he invaded the ukraine put<br>two treaties on the table<br>and he said and one treaty was for nato<br>and one treaty was for america<br>and he said this is what i want and what<br>he wants is<br>he<br>there was a promise there was a promise<br>made in 1991 an oral promise and the<br>oral promise made<br>by george bush senior in 1991 was that<br>nato won't move towards the east it's<br>true he did say that we know that<br>and then other presidents said it<br>afterwards as well but it was never<br>written down in a treaty it was never<br>something that was actually recorded as<br>legally binding<br>putin now wants the eastern parts of<br>europe that were once under the soviet<br>union to become autonomous and neutral<br>disarmed and not part of nato<br>so that's one thing he wants<br>the second thing he wants and this came<br>onto the paper yesterday<br>is he wants the ukraine to be neutral he<br>wants the ukraine to give up the crimea<br>like seed it to the soviet uh to russia<br>and he also wants the the two areas<br>that are in dispute uh<br>donetsk and luzansk he wants those to be<br>made independent countries so it's not<br>the question of the mediator it's the<br>question of whether you're willing to<br>let a country be forced to be neutral<br>and then the second question is are you<br>willing for the other nato countries<br>that have already signed to give up that<br>protection the problem is is that<br>and i know the answer to this is that<br>those other eastern european countries<br>are not going to give up the protection<br>of nato<br>that they know it's the only thing that<br>will give them complete security<br>and if there's one mistake and this is<br>the most bizarre conversation but if<br>there's one mistake that the ukrainians<br>would now like to go back on it was in<br>1994 when they gave up their nuclear<br>arsenal<br>to russia because and they said we'll<br>give it up and russia said we will sign<br>a treaty that you guys are safe and<br>independent and secure they signed it<br>they gave over the nukes well now the<br>ukrainians would like their nukes back<br>because the nuclear security is the only<br>thing that would have kept putin out and<br>for someone who spent his life arguing<br>against nuclear weapons it's a terrible<br>situation because every dictator on the<br>world will see that if you remove these<br>nuclear weapons and you imagine you're<br>in north korea right now watching what's<br>going on they know if you disarm the<br>over the years is critical conscience on<br>which which issues have you had the<br>biggest blow back<br>um<br>i did a lot of work on gun reform um and<br>i i got into a field of strife with the<br>gun lobby<br>and that was a good training ground for<br>talking about covert 19.<br>and the<br>on talking about covert 19 when i was<br>talking about<br>the idea of potential mandatory<br>vaccinations<br>there was<br>a<br>extreme waterfall of blowback<br>but the university to its credit really<br>how many seconds to midnight are we at<br>now<br>so this is a<br>um there's a clock a<br>it's a metaphor it's called the atomic<br>it comes out it's the atomic clock some<br>of you may have seen it and it's a it's<br>a symbol of where humanity is to<br>extinction it's not real it's not the<br>kind of thing that's actually in a place<br>and every month a group of nobel<br>laureates get together<br>and they they alter where humanity is<br>next to midnight midnight being<br>extinction with nuclear war<br>um<br>at the best point we were at 17 minutes<br>the clock got wound back in 1991<br>everyone remembers some of you remember<br>1991 that was a great year<br>um and and we all thought we were gonna<br>live happily ever after<br>and in the time since then it it it's<br>ratcheted all the way back up where we<br>are today 100 seconds to midnight<br>and in terms of precedence<br>100 seconds to midnight is where we were<br>last year<br>when trump was in power but biden's now<br>in power but nothing's really changing<br>we're just in a holding pattern and in<br>fact what you've actually seen in the<br>last 10 years is just a sequence of<br>bad adventures and collapsed treaties<br>and so we're seeing and if you're<br>looking at the russian example you go<br>chechnya<br>georgia syria<br>you talk about<br>putin removes his signature from the<br>international criminal court in 2016. he<br>quits the additional protocol which is<br>like laws of war some laws of war in<br>2019 the convention that dealt with arms<br>limitations in europe is ended in 2015.<br>trump quits the intimate intermediate<br>nuclear<br>forces treaty in 2018 the overflight<br>treaty also goes in 2018<br>and so where we are today is not<br>something that just came out of the blue<br>it's a sequence of time<br>that we've been running the clock down<br>could i speak more with why i think it<br>could be israel versus france and<br>germany um i think<br>if it was israel<br>israel has the advantage of being<br>very close to america<br>and in terms of uh its connections to<br>the white house and so they were perfect<br>intermediary<br>the advantage of france and germany is<br>that they are now that boris has left<br>europe that france and germany are the<br>the powerhouse of europe and they were<br>at the forefront of what we called the<br>minsk accords and the minsk accords were<br>agreed in 2014 and 2015<br>and this would have given substantial<br>autonomy to the two eastern regions that<br>putin now wants to be made independent<br>nations<br>the good thing about the minsk accords<br>is that they were agreed by the security<br>council<br>but they were never acted on and so<br>in some ways putin's now saying we want<br>this to happen as promised in 2015. but<br>i think also france and germany<br>are at the forefront of the european<br>response<br>and if it's going to get more difficult<br>in terms of sanctions which it will and<br>it will go from gas to petrol and you<br>will see that at the petrol pump it will<br>be those two countries that drive it or<br>not<br>uh<br>you stated that as a country we should<br>have less tolerance to people those who<br>say they're going to kill you<br>what law and policy changes would you<br>like to see to give bit of less<br>tolerance um it's already in the crimes<br>act it's seven years in jail if you're<br>threatened to kill someone<br>and i think what's happened is we've<br>become so loose with our language that<br>sometimes it's thought well maybe you<br>can just say that but you can't and so i<br>don't want to see a law change here i<br>want to see the police just arrest those<br>people who are threatening to kill the<br>journalists or threaten to kill the<br>politicians and deal with them<br>through a normal legal process<br>it's a<br>a hard topic but and i firmly believe in<br>free speech but not to the point of<br>your work exposes you to the worst<br>aspects of society terror war pandemics<br>how do you cope emotionally and having<br>to continually engage<br>i don't think my family would agree on<br>that um<br>can comment objectively on these issues<br>i i i love the ocean i spend a lot of<br>time surfing i spend time<br>with my family trying not to talk about<br>certain issues we try to carve out space<br>where it can't just preoccupy you i<br>think one of the<br>great virtues of being an academic is<br>that you get the time to<br>to study things and see a length of<br>history and so then when something comes<br>up which is different you can say well<br>that that's different but hopefully you<br>do you think the police's response<br>what do you think of the police's<br>response throughout the occupation of<br>parliament um one word excellent<br>um i think the<br>there was a point when the occupation of<br>parliament and the surrounding streets<br>was<br>very difficult and there was soft talk<br>about sending the military in because<br>there were so many people that had to be<br>dealt with and vehicles removed and the<br>government to its credit<br>did not entertain that idea<br>and then the police went forward and<br>dealt with it as they did so when i say<br>the word excellent i i say that because<br>even though it got stressful towards the<br>end<br>i see the the police efforts today in<br>comparison to what would have happened<br>to sort of like saying consider the 1981<br>springbok tour some of you will remember<br>what that was like and the tensions that<br>we saw in our country<br>and when i think about the police in<br>that point the the police acted with<br>such a heavy hand in 1981 there were<br>points when the police didn't put<br>identification numbers on themselves so<br>that they couldn't be<br>identified afterwards<br>and there were some<br>no one was killed no one was seriously<br>hurt but there was a lot of civil<br>disturbance but<br>the lack of trust in the police from<br>1991 was so great that in 1984 we had a<br>riot down queen street with the at the<br>end of the year and they just lost<br>control and they had a they had a review<br>commission over why did it happen<br>and the review commission said was that<br>there was no respect for the police<br>because they'd become so alienated from<br>the public<br>today i see the police are part of the<br>public i think they've worked very hard<br>with new legislation we have the<br>independent police panel so that they've<br>got an oversight body to make sure that<br>they're acting<br>to the highest standards<br>and the professionalism and dealing with<br>a very difficult situation so i would<br>what do you think the government should<br>do next in terms of the vaccine mandates<br>i think<br>no restriction on liberty<br>should stand for one minute longer than<br>it is justified<br>and so i think the onus of justification<br>is on the government and as soon as it<br>is no longer justified it should be<br>removed and this is a burden that we<br>should keep on them to make sure as soon<br>as it's not necessary it comes off<br>but we should never just take it for<br>granted that it's legitimate we should<br>what might you assess the problems of<br>misinformation and how might they be<br>counted um<br>this is a common question and i'm not<br>the one to answer it but i am aware that<br>there is a<br>a large part in our society which is<br>alienated from many people in the way<br>that we use science and the way that we<br>use reason<br>and the way that we use civil behavior<br>i think the way we deal with it<br>starts off on a personal level with<br>people around us and trying to engage<br>and not let go and i'll be honest<br>sometimes it's very hard when you've got<br>friends and family who just drift into a<br>very different kind of world<br>but<br>this time will pass<br>and it's about trying to find those<br>things we have in common so that we can<br>come back together<br>for the government<br>that's beyond my pay grade but there's a<br>lot of work to be done in education<br>uh i think that<br>the way that we learn to interact with<br>each other as citizens<br>tolerance for diversity<br>listening to people that we don't always<br>agree with and this is this is hard but<br>sometimes even if it is painful we still<br>need to try to hear what they're trying<br>how could the ukraine situation be<br>resolved from here<br>well<br>if you want peace you can you can have<br>peace tomorrow<br>and the deal tomorrow is<br>the ukraine<br>loses its foreign policy autonomy which<br>means that it has to stay neutral for<br>the rest of its existence<br>it has to give up the crimea and it has<br>to give up the eastern part of the<br>country's independent countries<br>so you can have peace the question<br>you've got to work out is is that a<br>price that you're willing to accept<br>and then the other question you've got<br>to ask after that is what do you do with<br>the other european countries<br>are you willing to accept them being in<br>a situation where they may be next<br>my guess is i don't think<br>putin is kind of a little bit unhinged<br>right now<br>and when you hear this trying to talk<br>about nuclear war it is disconcerting<br>but i don't think he would push into a<br>nato country i think even he knows that<br>do you feel that new zealand government<br>has lent or required more experience<br>than what they had<br>held in governance<br>when navigating their way through the<br>past two to three years<br>um<br>no one it's that crystal ball thing that<br>no one could have guessed it would be<br>this bad<br>there was one period when i was so proud<br>of that i'm not going to tell you if i'm<br>left with my right one i can i can go<br>both<br>but<br>there was one period when i was so proud<br>of the government and that was when they<br>created the epidemic response committee<br>where we went into a situation of<br>emergency where legislation was given<br>and the oversight was created to a<br>committee that was chaired by then simon<br>bridges and power was shared<br>and i'm a firm believer that in times of<br>emergency it's best to share power as<br>much as possible we saw more sharing of<br>power<br>in the the first term of the government<br>not so much in the second and i think<br>that's a regret to the country even when<br>you have the numbers and you don't need<br>to share i think in times of emergency<br>it's better that you do<br>the the law itself i think was<br>good but drafted quickly and we've seen<br>a couple of court cases lately where<br>it's come back and it's bitten the<br>government where they exceeded their<br>authority or they didn't justify certain<br>things even though they had the power it<br>was expressed wrongly so i think they<br>why has trust in the dominant narrative<br>gone for covered protesters<br>why don't they believe the press and<br>government and commentators like<br>yourself um i don't know that<br>i'm the wrong person to ask that but but<br>there is a gap<br>i think part of it has to do with the<br>availability of information on that<br>doesn't require you to necessarily be<br>critical<br>and i think one of the skills that we've<br>lost we can be lost easily is the<br>ability of critical thinking that you<br>can actually look at things and say<br>there's this and there's that and this<br>dazzle doesn't add up<br>but that's a task for new zealand that<br>what key areas do you think policy<br>resources need to be dedicated by the<br>i'm concerned about the the gap<br>with poverty in new zealand i think<br>there is a<br>i think it's going to get worse<br>i'm concerned about rising inflation and<br>that that group of people at the bottom<br>and child poverty in particular<br>and<br>it will be hard<br>because right now the discussion in the<br>media is about whether we reduce taxes<br>whether we keep them the same but for me<br>the biggest thing i see right now going<br>forward<br>post pandemic post russia<br>is how do we maintain the cohesiveness<br>of as a society and to me the test of<br>cohesiveness is that everyone has the<br>young people in particular have the<br>opportunity to partake equally and that<br>how do you foster the values of critic<br>and conscience in your students oh i<br>don't<br>they they just go<br>it's pretty hard when you but one thing<br>students are not short of especially at<br>our law school is an opinion<br>and and that they will tell you very<br>forthrightly and that that's what you<br>want i try very hard not to tell my<br>students what is right or wrong i try to<br>always say this is the evidence this is<br>the material<br>and i won't grade them on if they've got<br>a right or wrong opinion but i will<br>grade them on what the evidence is and<br>how they marshal it<br>i think the best quality we can give as<br>educators is critical thinking and<br>do you think there is a risk that sweden<br>and finland may be invaded by russia<br>um<br>this is a code question and that's<br>that's because finland and sweden are<br>not yet members of nato<br>i think that the finland has a difficult<br>relationship with russia<br>and sweden also but i think the one<br>thing that putin didn't want was<br>countries to join nato but now you're<br>going to find those countries that were<br>sitting on the fence like sweden and<br>finland will suddenly join nato but the<br>thing that we need to be thinking about<br>here is not just whether the europeans<br>join nato but whether we ourselves<br>extend and deepen our relationship with<br>nato so we're kind of like mates with<br>nato but we could have a deeper<br>engagement like australia took in 2014.<br>and then the other debate that the<br>europeans are having that we also need<br>to have now is are we spending enough on<br>the military<br>we're currently at 1.5<br>of our gdp which is a lot of money and<br>we have a housing crisis and we have<br>social crisis and there's a lot of<br>demand for that money but we have to<br>start thinking now do we need more do we<br>need to raise that or are we happy the<br>the good news here is that both labor<br>and national in the last five years have<br>steadily increased the spend on the<br>military but other countries are<br>spending more and we have to ask is that<br>what we want to do<br>and not just do we spend more but do we<br>become more interoperable with our<br>friends and allies<br>and this is like thinking like what it<br>was like in 1939 do we need to be<br>prepared to actually<br>put our soldiers in a more difficult<br>position<br>and we're already seeing that not just<br>with regards to the ukraine but also<br>with regards we sent our frigate through<br>the south china sea one of our frigates<br>we've only got two<br>but we sent one of them uh through the<br>south china sea with the the british<br>flotilla a few months ago<br>and so for a country which for a long<br>time has said like we're nuclear free<br>we're on the side all of a sudden the<br>world's coming towards us and we have to<br>what's your opinion about some<br>presidents such as that from brazil<br>that intend to face this war with a<br>neutral position<br>as they say it is a really dangerous<br>situation<br>with what's happening between russia and<br>ukraine<br>it's um some of you would have seen the<br>news before you came in new zealand has<br>just been put on the naughty list by the<br>kremlin there's 22 countries it means we<br>do not get a christmas card this year<br>for mr putin<br>and the the reason we're on the naughty<br>list is because we we're passing<br>sanctions<br>some countries like brazil<br>like india<br>like the united arab emirates<br>potentially like israel are trying not<br>to be critical of russia because there<br>will be there will be economic<br>repercussions there will be diplomatic<br>repercussions<br>there may even be social repercussions<br>in some regards<br>what do i think i think it's time for<br>new zealand to stand up and say this is<br>where we are this is our values we<br>believe in the united nations charter we<br>believe in democracy we believe in<br>freedom we believe in the sovereignty of<br>these countries to determine their own<br>future i think that's where we should<br>stand others will take a different point<br>of view and then say this war is<br>happening all the way over there<br>can new zealand actually influence or<br>have any impact on the russian situation<br>or is it just words that won't make any<br>difference in putin's eyes<br>which countries will take notice of new<br>zealand's new sanctions um mr putin's<br>not going to be lying awake tonight to<br>look at new zealand sanctions bill<br>and<br>what we do will make that that much<br>difference<br>on russia and the decision to go left or<br>right<br>but what it does do is it's symbolic it<br>shows where we stand as a country and<br>what values we can contribute<br>right now it's not about the scale of<br>our contribution because we haven't got<br>a lot to give but it's about standing as<br>we always have in times of difficulty<br>with countries which share our values or<br>don't<br>the alternative not to stand up to go<br>for a neutral position<br>is that<br>the risk is<br>that the ukraine may be digested<br>but my concern is it's not the ukraine<br>because i think the ukraine will battle<br>but what happens next because we enter<br>into a lawless world<br>because other countries are learning<br>what do i think about china's human<br>rights record how should new zealand<br>respond<br>there are many<br>allegations about<br>china's human rights record and<br>particularly the concerns of what may or<br>may not be genocide<br>one of the<br>concerns about the sanctions legislation<br>is that<br>it some people call up your autonomous<br>sanctions and that means that the<br>government can now set its own sanctions<br>on anything it wants outside of the un<br>system but the law is crafted just to<br>cover russia and i think it's very<br>important that it just covers russia<br>because if a country gets into a<br>position where they can start<br>sanctioning<br>anything they disagree with that they<br>may discover that the list of things<br>that they don't like is is very long and<br>always controversial and so my hope is<br>that we go back to the un system and so<br>when i want to go back to the un system<br>what i want with china is i want china<br>to open up its doors to accredited<br>international human rights observers<br>from geneva<br>and these people can go in and they can<br>assess it critically and they can say<br>this is happening or this isn't<br>happening so i think the new zealand<br>response is support the un system for<br>independent observers rather than us<br>making a guess that it is a genocide or<br>should we be worried about china's<br>the problem with the pacific is that<br>we've<br>never given it enough attention<br>and we've always said to these people uh<br>you need to support us because we're<br>australian or we're kiwis and we've<br>taken it for granted that they will<br>support us and then we got grumpy when<br>they haven't supported us<br>and that's been reflected in our aid<br>budgets for how much money we've<br>supported for humanitarian for<br>environmental for social projects<br>and now other players are coming into<br>the pacific like china and they're<br>saying we're going to give you a whole<br>bucket load of cash and you can build an<br>airport or you can build a port<br>and it's very easy for us to say don't<br>do that you shouldn't take that you<br>don't want to build that school don't<br>take that money<br>if we don't want the chinese influence<br>in the pacific we have to step up more<br>we have to fill that void and we have to<br>be realistic about the relationship with<br>them<br>and our obligations and their<br>responsibilities towards us<br>and this will get hard because again our<br>aid budget is not great<br>but if you are concerned about china you<br>have to make sure that our own<br>engagement in the pacific deepens much<br>at this point in time with everything's<br>going on do you spend more time as a<br>critic or a conscience<br>um<br>uh i think it's 50 50.<br>i try to be neutral<br>but sometimes the government drives me<br>mad sometimes the opposition drives me<br>equally mad<br>i think one of the things i've been<br>working on mostly in the last couple of<br>years is<br>trying to be more neutral and trying to<br>get kiwis to see the global picture and<br>will the who treaty be based on<br>information gathered through<br>the suggested royal commission what are<br>the implications<br>was it being part of the treaty<br>formation process that i i don't know if<br>the government will do a royal<br>commission i i don't think they like the<br>idea even though i'm trying to explain<br>it's<br>a neutral idea<br>but with the who treaty i'm not even<br>sure we'll actually get there because<br>normally what happens in international<br>law is you have a disaster and when<br>there's a disaster you get a response so<br>for example in 1986 chernobyl blew up<br>and when chernobyl blew up within five<br>months we got a new treaty whereby<br>everyone agreed to share information<br>very quickly saying if this nuclear<br>wreck is going to blow up i'll tell my<br>neighbour cool<br>the problem<br>now<br>is that we are two years past covert<br>and that period where you<br>gather all that energy of humanity and<br>say let's bang out a new treaty is<br>starting to dissipate and what each<br>country wants with the new treaty on the<br>pandemic is very different and so for a<br>country like new zealand the only thing<br>we're really what we really want is we<br>want to extend or shorten that time<br>sequence<br>so that we can find out quicker and<br>close our borders and so we want we want<br>information exchange we want informal<br>routes we want uh genetic sharing of<br>pathogens and so we want to we're all<br>focused on early notification<br>but if you go to africa africa isn't<br>concerned about early notification<br>they're concerned about the covert<br>vaccine and equity and why they have to<br>pay such a large amount of money over<br>this product<br>other countries have different concerns<br>some of them want to build their<br>infrastructure<br>and so what you're seeing now is 160<br>countries coming together<br>with different objectives and so will we<br>actually get a new treaty that has any<br>teeth in it that will actually make it<br>safer for the next generation i don't<br>know<br>but right now it's going to get<br>difficult but we should get an idea<br>could new zealand provide recognition<br>and lethal or non-lethal support<br>that opposed to russian-backed<br>militia military junta in myanmar<br>it is closer to new zealand's backyard<br>but receives little attention compared<br>to the ukraine in just last year<br>and that that's true it is what's<br>happened in myanmar or burma<br>is a travesty but<br>it's an absolute travesty but the the<br>difference between what's happened in<br>myanmar and what's happened in the<br>ukraine is one is an internal conflict<br>and one is an external conflict<br>it's for a while it was more common for<br>countries to implode and when they<br>implode they're difficult to disentangle<br>but this is different because you've got<br>a traditional country where one has come<br>right over the border trying to destroy<br>the sovereignty of that so i think it's<br>it's legitimate to have a very strong<br>you spoke about the bill of rights and<br>the collective good can i expand on this<br>when i spoke about the<br>bill of rights<br>the funny thing about the bill of rights<br>is that when we think about the bill of<br>rights we think we're in america<br>and you've kind of got these individual<br>absolute rights<br>but in new zealand we don't we have a<br>law which isn't entrenched which means<br>it can be repealed<br>and we have a balancing act and so where<br>the americans tend to think of absolute<br>rights<br>in new zealand it's more nuanced<br>and all of the rights we possess pretty<br>much every right apart from torture<br>can be limited if it is and i'm quoting<br>article 5 here<br>demonstrably justified in a free and<br>democratic society<br>so you may have a right to freedom of<br>assembly or you may have a right to<br>freedom of association<br>but parliament can push through<br>legislation or can put that right if<br>it's proportionate and balance to one<br>side for a short period<br>and when i talk about the collective<br>good<br>what i'm saying here is that with covert<br>19 the government acted in a way<br>of what was good for the majority of us<br>and that meant that some individual<br>rights were pushed to one side not<br>completely extinguished but certainly<br>made more<br>we're a small fish but close to home<br>councils can they do anything on these<br>big issues that are national or<br>international<br>uh<br>we all can and i i think the councils<br>have a large responsibility to play<br>and<br>sometimes it's not about the concrete<br>actions it's about the symbolism of what<br>we do about the support for<br>a cause of the ukraine<br>sometimes it's about an offer of what<br>you can do it maybe in terms of offering<br>has the new zealand media lost its<br>independence and do you think they are<br>playing a role in spreading the division<br>well<br>i think the new zealand media is one of<br>the best medias in the world<br>i think we ran rank about eighth on uh<br>the various indices of where our freedom<br>is that the the freedom of new zealand<br>media is also<br>governed by law over what we should and<br>shouldn't do and the importance to show<br>both sides of the story<br>to be balanced and to be as factual as<br>possible so i think new zealand media on<br>the whole is doing good but it could<br>potentially do better<br>amanda have we had the end time i feel<br>like i'm going to pop up here<br>uh colin has asked me with my last<br>question should we be stockpiling seeds<br>um<br>sure<br>uh you can you can springs just around<br>the corner and it will be a good time to<br>start thinking about the next government<br>the next season<br>uh<br>i don't these are stressful times i i<br>don't believe<br>that we are heading to a cataclysmic end<br>i think we're starting to i think the<br>pandemic is largely under control<br>there's certainly going to be<br>difficulties going forward but i think<br>we're past the worst event<br>i think the ukraine situation will get<br>difficult for a year perhaps<br>but i don't think it will spread into<br>something else the best news as i said<br>is that china decided to sit on the<br>fence and that's given us a breathing<br>space to actually work out what values<br>so i<br>do i say feel well<br>okay feel well thank you um</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
