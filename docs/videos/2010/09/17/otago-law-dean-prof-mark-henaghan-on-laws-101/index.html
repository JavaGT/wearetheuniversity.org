font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so what we're going to do today is look<br>at the um outcome of Dudley and<br>Stevens's case and the first thing we<br>need to do is work out the ratio of the<br>case work out what what can we extract<br>as we saw Dudley and Stevens were found<br>guilty of<br>murder<br>I think the most important thing for me<br>is to see in their faces and in their<br>kind of as they're listening hopefully<br>and when they take down notes that<br>they're actually thinking about it and<br>learning something you can see their<br>minds working I mean you can actually<br>see it so what we have to work out is<br>what principle or rule can we get out of<br>the case from What was decided and the<br>way you want to ask them to to engage<br>their mind and see them one side of the<br>brain work other side of the brain work<br>they can actually start to think about<br>yeah so you're really trying to I<br>suppose in a sense infiltrate their<br>thinking process which sounds a bit<br>dangerous but that's what we're trying<br>to do so let's look at a possible ratio<br>and I think this one um is probably too<br>narrow and then we'll look at what I<br>think is probably the arguable ratio for<br>the case I think that's the key to going<br>to let you've got to free your mind up<br>and just you've got your material but<br>but go with it in terms of how you see<br>things and sometimes a response in the<br>class can be can just put their finger<br>on it what he said aha now it's clear<br>who should die would that have made a<br>difference to him if we go back to his<br>reasoning no you're right tell his why<br>even if it was to let's assume it was<br>certain would have made any difference<br>to Lord colid um you can tell that he<br>really loves the topic and really loves<br>talking about it and and explaining it<br>and trying to you know get his points<br>across and getting us to understand<br>which is you know makes it interesting<br>makes it really easy to learn um very<br>engaging he he seems to manage to make<br>eye contact with almost everyone which<br>is really nice you feel like he's<br>talking at you rather than just to the<br>to the masses and he's um quite quite<br>sort of dynamic in his movement does he<br>just stand there and<br>yeah he really makes it a bit more<br>tangible than just a just spoken what I<br>want to do now is put a little video<br>clip on the first one's from a movie<br>called Vertical Limit and that that's<br>based on a scenario of someone being cut<br>off a mountain the second one's from a<br>real case about two Englishmen climbing<br>in the Andes and one had to cut the<br>other one and and and we we'll see a<br>little clip and he talks about what it<br>was like when he cut that rope I've<br>always been a Monty Python fan that<br>everything has a ridiculous side to it<br>and if we can see it kind of releases us<br>it freezes up to sort of say<br>we can survive this and I suppose the<br>first thing he says I won't be your<br>friend if you try that sort of trick on<br>me again but no he didn't say that he<br>actually said you did the right thing<br>but the question is did he do the right<br>thing a lot of people have the<br>impression that Law's just a lot of<br>rules but it's a human thing so there's<br>a lovely human element to it so how we<br>interpret those rules and how we apply<br>them so you learn a lot about the kind<br>of society you are it's not just the<br>black and white thing that's the that's<br>the one thing about L I really like and<br>you have to fight for every position<br>position and say why is this more<br>important than that and that's the way<br>life is I think there isn't if we all<br>knew the answers to everything it was<br>all black and white it'd be a little<br>scary wouldn't it so you did the wrong<br>thing and don't do it again but on the<br>other hand we're going to excuse it<br>that's in a sense what happened in the<br>real case wasn't it it was said not to<br>be it was the wrong thing to do the<br>court said but it was excused by The<br>Sovereign in a sense so it's it's a<br>great skill for thinking it's great to<br>learn about your society and and I think<br>also you learn about the values that you<br>think are really important and the<br>values of your Society and you can<br>challenge<br>them</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
