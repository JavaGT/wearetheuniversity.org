In a 'Thesis Idol' style set-up, the judges commented on the quality of the presentations. Each heat was judged by three people including faculty academics and communications experts.<br>The entrants were judged on the following criteria:<br>1. Communication style <br>Was the thesis topic and its significance communicated in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience? <br>2. Comprehension <br>Did the presentation help the audience understand the research? <br>3. Engagement <br>Did the oration make the audience want to know more? <br><br>More information can be found at www.auckland.ac.nz/3minutethesis</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>at this very moment<br>there is an electronic device that is<br>able to see<br>and is able to hear recording everything<br>i do<br>and everything i say<br>but unless you have one hidden in your<br>pocket<br>there is no electronic device recording<br>my smells oh<br>gee i used it yesterday not very good<br>master of ceremonies ladies gentlemen<br>and anyone<br>who doesn't like going through the<br>airport and being sniffed<br>by a dog have you ever seen an<br>electronic device<br>that can smell electronic noses or<br>solder noses exist<br>but the reason you haven't seen them<br>around is because they are not very good<br>or they are very big<br>my phd research is about trying to make<br>a portable sovereign notes<br>by using smell receptors from insects<br>insects have an exquisite sense of smell<br>and they smell<br>with their antennae i'm illustrating<br>here with pablo de vie<br>in their antennae pablo de vie and other<br>insects<br>have smell receptors with the function<br>to capture smells<br>floating in the air we also have smell<br>receptors but can you guess where we<br>have them<br>when these receptors are sitting in the<br>antennae<br>and when a smell comes into contact with<br>them they go from open conformation to<br>close conformation<br>that is the signal that tells the brain<br>that a particular smell is there because<br>the receptor has<br>captured it and the brain can detect<br>that the<br>the receptor has changed conformation if<br>that smell<br>is coming from a flower pablo debbie<br>will move closer to the flower but if<br>that smell was coming from a predator<br>pablo de vie will fly away<br>if we manage to put those receptors<br>in an electronic device that is able to<br>detect<br>that change in conformation from open to<br>close<br>then we will have given the first step<br>towards the cybernodes because<br>now it will be the electronic device<br>being able to tell that a particular<br>smell<br>is there<br>a part what i'm trying what i'm doing<br>right now bless you by the way<br>what i'm doing right now is i'm trying<br>to make those receptors<br>making making sure they are still able<br>to capture smells<br>and studying how the changing<br>conformation from open to close<br>occurs so we can detect it<br>electronically<br>a portable sovereign knowledge would not<br>only have applications in security</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
