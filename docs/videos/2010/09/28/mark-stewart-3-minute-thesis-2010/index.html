In a 'Thesis Idol' style set-up, the judges commented on the quality of the presentations. Each heat was judged by three people including faculty academics and communications experts.<br>The entrants were judged on the following criteria:<br>1. Communication style <br>Was the thesis topic and its significance communicated in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience? <br>2. Comprehension <br>Did the presentation help the audience understand the research? <br>3. Engagement <br>Did the oration make the audience want to know more? <br><br>More information can be found at www.auckland.ac.nz/3minutethesis</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>anybody who's watched Television over<br>the last 15 years will acknowledge that<br>television has changed in some ways it<br>might still look the same but there have<br>been important shifts in key areas that<br>have changed the nature of<br>Television firstly people are watching<br>television in different ways there are<br>now a large range of channels with many<br>dedicated ten Niche interests<br>people can also access that programming<br>with a lot more flexibility using<br>devices like my sky or to online on<br>demand services or watching TV on<br>DVD there is more television and more<br>ways to watch<br>it but what people are watching has<br>changed as<br>well at the end of the 20th century<br>reality TV became a powerful programming<br>force in a variety of different formats<br>many dramas became became more serial<br>requiring a much higher level of<br>Engagement and attention from Their<br>audience and thirdly the economic basis<br>of television has been forced to shift<br>in the past television was funded by<br>networks selling audiences to<br>advertisers the changing viewing models<br>have meant that there are fewer viewers<br>for any given program and no guarantee<br>that any of those viewers are actually<br>watching the advertising<br>marketers have had to find new models<br>such as reverting to product<br>placement what makes my research novel<br>is the integrated approach I take<br>providing evidence of how closely these<br>three separate concepts are<br>interrelated for example narratively<br>complex dramas weren't feasible before<br>the technology existed for repeat<br>viewing reality television provides huge<br>marketing opportunities and outside of<br>the traditional 30C<br>advertisement my research is based on<br>four case studies as representative<br>dramas I've chosen Buffy the Vampire<br>Slayer and<br>lost Buffy was one of the first of the<br>new generation of Dramas working with<br>the new technologies to find successful<br>modes of Engagement when lost launched a<br>year after Buffy ended the narrative<br>landscape had completely<br>changed I'm also analyzing the two<br>American reality TV juggernauts American<br>Idol and<br>Survivor both launched early in the 21st<br>century and while both utilize in-depth<br>product placement they draw on very<br>different forms of audience engagement<br>in order to create some of the best<br>ratings on broadcast television in 20<br>years the media's made much over falling<br>ratings calling it the end of broadcast<br>television but my research suggests that<br>instead we are just seeing a Rec<br>configuration a move to understanding<br>the new landscape television is dead<br>television</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
