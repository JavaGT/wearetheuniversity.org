In a 'Thesis Idol' style set-up, the judges commented on the quality of the presentations. Each heat was judged by three people including faculty academics and communications experts.<br>The entrants were judged on the following criteria:<br>1. Communication style <br>Was the thesis topic and its significance communicated in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience? <br>2. Comprehension <br>Did the presentation help the audience understand the research? <br>3. Engagement <br>Did the oration make the audience want to know more? <br><br>More information can be found at www.auckland.ac.nz/3minutethesis</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so do you think that angelina jolie has<br>everything<br>well she certainly snagged brad pitt but<br>even she couldn't escape the potentially<br>deadly disorder of preeclampsia<br>when she was pregnant with her beautiful<br>twins so what is this horrifying disease<br>that even one of the sexiest riches and<br>most famous women in the world can't<br>avoid<br>well preeclampsia is a disorder where<br>mom suffers from dangerously high blood<br>pressure during pregnancy<br>it has no known cause and can strike any<br>pregnant woman as unexpectedly as a bolt<br>from the blue<br>which is how it was first described by<br>the ancient greeks over 2000 years ago<br>and yet to this day it has no effective<br>cure the only way to save mom<br>from developing seizures and eventually<br>dying<br>is basically to deliver the baby far<br>before it is due and completely removed<br>the placenta from inside of her<br>now the placenta or after birth is an<br>amazing organ<br>that anchors the baby to mum and<br>nourishes it throughout pregnancy<br>a healthy placenta is absolutely<br>necessary for a healthy pregnancy<br>now normally during pregnancy large<br>clumps of dead placental cells called<br>sensitive knots<br>are shed straight into mom's blood<br>usually these don't have any effect on<br>mum<br>in fact they actually help her to<br>recognize the baby as part of her own<br>body<br>and not as a foreign object some<br>sometimes however<br>in some pregnancies mum can produce<br>certain inflammatory factors<br>that cause inserial knots to become more<br>toxic to her<br>now some scientists and by that i don't<br>mean just me my supervisor<br>believe that these toxic sensitive knots<br>could cause a further inflammatory<br>reaction in mum<br>giving rise to even more toxic sincere<br>knots and<br>eventually leading to a kind of vicious<br>cycle or catch-22 situation<br>the end result of which is high blood<br>pressure in pre-eclampsia<br>so my research specifically looks at how<br>mums inflammatory factors<br>change the genes and proteins expressed<br>in sensitive knots<br>i'm also looking at the effects of these<br>changes in sensitive knots<br>on mom's immune system during pregnancy<br>so to actually collect these sensitive<br>knots i use a micro manipulator<br>which is a fancy pants device that's<br>mostly used in fertility<br>clinics to create test tube babies um<br>and this is something that nobody in the<br>world has ever done before<br>not to talk myself up too much or<br>anything but i'm actually working on a<br>completely new protocol<br>so so far my research has shown that<br>mum's inflammatory factors<br>cause changes in 118 different genes now<br>these gene changes<br>could upset the delicate balance<br>required to maintain a normal healthy<br>pregnancy<br>causing harmful reactions in mum<br>eventually leading to high blood<br>pressure and previously<br>so why am i doing all this fantastic<br>cutting-edge research looking at genes<br>and proteins and what have you<br>the answer is pretty simple my work<br>could help to identify new therapeutic<br>targets<br>and develop a cure for pre-eclampsia<br>that doesn't put either mum or baby at<br>risk<br>my research has one single goal and that<br>is to contribute to understanding the<br>cause of preeclampsia<br>understanding the cause of preeclampsia<br>will help us to better manage this<br>disease that doesn't just affect<br>angelina jolie<br>but affects almost nine million women<br>and their babies worldwide year after</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
