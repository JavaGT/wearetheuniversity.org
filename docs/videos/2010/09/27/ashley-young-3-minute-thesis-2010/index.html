In a 'Thesis Idol' style set-up, the judges commented on the quality of the presentations. Each heat was judged by three people including faculty academics and communications experts.<br>The entrants were judged on the following criteria:<br>1. Communication style <br>Was the thesis topic and its significance communicated in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience? <br>2. Comprehension <br>Did the presentation help the audience understand the research? <br>3. Engagement <br>Did the oration make the audience want to know more? <br><br>More information can be found at www.auckland.ac.nz/3minutethesis</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good afternoon the project that i'm<br>going to talk to you about today<br>relates to an activity that you're going<br>to spend more than six years of your<br>life doing<br>you've probably done that already twice<br>today at least and if you haven't<br>why haven't you now your body needs it<br>it's a gratifying process<br>sometimes you'll do it by yourself and<br>sometimes it'll be more of a social<br>activity<br>that's right it's mastication<br>mastication is a complex set of<br>processes involved when you take a piece<br>of food into your mouth<br>and you break it down and you make it<br>into a bolus that you can swallow<br>and by the term bolus i'm simply<br>referring to a mixture of food particles<br>and saliva<br>okay so everyone eats but how many of<br>you actually think about what you're<br>doing when you're eating<br>how do you know how many chews to take<br>and how do you know when to swallow<br>well my project involves looking at the<br>life of a bolus<br>so something like a biscuit starts off<br>as a solid but when you go to swallow it<br>it's a semi-solid that can flow so what<br>is happening during this transformation<br>and how does the way the food fields<br>change throughout that whole process<br>and how are these two things related<br>please note i'm not interested in the<br>biscuit after the point of swallowing<br>i'm not interested in nutrition i'm not<br>interested in taste i'm interested in<br>the mouth feel of the bulbous<br>so the way it feels when you're eating<br>it so how am i going to study these<br>things<br>well a food bowl is at any point in<br>mastication is a complex<br>material as an engineer i'm going to<br>take principles that are usually applied<br>to materials such as metals<br>ceramics and polymers and apply it to a<br>food bowlers<br>so the structure of a food bolus this<br>might be the size of the particles in it<br>is related to its physical mechanical<br>and rheological properties<br>for example how well does it flow and<br>these physical properties are related to<br>its mouth feel<br>but then its mouth feel is involved when<br>you decide how to masticate your food<br>and hence affects<br>the structure of your bolus so we've got<br>a loop of these three things<br>now to investigate these interrelated<br>areas and work towards the goal<br>of being able to design a food with a<br>certain mouth feel<br>i'm going to get people to chew and<br>expectorate biscuits that have been<br>masticated<br>for varying degrees i'm then going to<br>study the structure of these boluses by<br>quantitatively analyzing images<br>that have been obtained using techniques<br>such as optical and scanning electron<br>microscopy<br>but my main challenge is to develop a<br>suitable instrumental test<br>or tests that's capable of measuring the<br>properties<br>of the bolus that are changing with<br>mastication now currently i'm looking at<br>tests which are based on principles such<br>as rheology<br>viscoelasticity and fraction mechanics<br>okay<br>so if you take just one thing from my<br>talk today please do me a favor<br>next time you're eating think about<br>what's happening to its structure and<br>think about its mouth feel<br>just a bit of food for thought for all<br>of you enjoy your pizza tonight thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
