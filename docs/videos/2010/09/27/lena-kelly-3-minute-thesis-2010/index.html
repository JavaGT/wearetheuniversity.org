In a 'Thesis Idol' style set-up, the judges commented on the quality of the presentations. Each heat was judged by three people including faculty academics and communications experts.<br>The entrants were judged on the following criteria:<br>1. Communication style <br>Was the thesis topic and its significance communicated in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience? <br>2. Comprehension <br>Did the presentation help the audience understand the research? <br>3. Engagement <br>Did the oration make the audience want to know more? <br><br>More information can be found at www.auckland.ac.nz/3minutethesis</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good afternoon ladies and gentlemen<br>my name's lena and i'm a civil engineer<br>and this here<br>is why you should care about my thesis<br>this is the skaheri bridge<br>a concrete and steel bridge built in the<br>1950s that's part of the highway that<br>links new york city<br>with buffalo but 35 years after it was<br>built<br>the bridge collapsed into the river<br>below killing 10 people<br>and cutting the highway so my question<br>for you<br>is why why did this bridge collapse<br>was it simply not strong enough did the<br>water erode away some of the concrete<br>were the supports not correctly attached<br>to the top of the bridge<br>the actual answer is not something you<br>can see<br>from first glance it lies at the very<br>bottom of the<br>bridge at the base of the supports the<br>answer<br>is bridgegaar which is the topic of my<br>thesis<br>i aim to improve the method of<br>predicting bridge tower<br>so that incidents like this don't happen<br>to people like you<br>think back to the last time you're at<br>the beach you're standing in the<br>shallows gazing out to sea<br>and a wave breaks across your ankles the<br>next thing you feel<br>is the water surging back past you<br>towards the ocean<br>and if you look down at your feet you<br>will notice that the sand behind your<br>feet has been washed away<br>by scouring your feet are then left<br>unsupported and your heels will sink<br>back into the sand<br>bridge scale is exactly the same thing<br>it's a process by which the sand<br>surrounding the supports of the bridge<br>is eroded away in the case of the<br>scohari bridge<br>the depth of the scour reached 3 meters<br>causing the supports of the bridge<br>to tip towards the hole and topple the<br>this is not one isolated case in fact<br>bridgeguard has been found to be the<br>cause<br>of 60 of all america's bridge failures<br>the existing bridge the existing bridge<br>scout prediction equations<br>only apply to certain types of bridge<br>designs<br>and water depths my research involves<br>modeling<br>different types of bridges and gathering<br>a range of data<br>so that these equations can be modified<br>so they're applicable<br>the results of my thesis will improve<br>both the accuracy<br>and the scope of these bridge scour<br>equations<br>with the results designers can then see<br>whether bridge scout is going to be a<br>critical factor<br>in their design and if it is they can<br>choose to<br>change the shape of the pairs change the<br>location of the supports<br>they can even choose to armor the area<br>where the scale will occur<br>this will lead to efficient designs<br>cheaper bridges and ultimately fewer<br>failures<br>so next time you're driving across the<br>harbour bridge looking for a crack<br>feeling its way just remember it's</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
