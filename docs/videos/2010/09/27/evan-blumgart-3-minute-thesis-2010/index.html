In a 'Thesis Idol' style set-up, the judges commented on the quality of the presentations. Each heat was judged by three people including faculty academics and communications experts.<br>The entrants were judged on the following criteria:<br>1. Communication style <br>Was the thesis topic and its significance communicated in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience? <br>2. Comprehension <br>Did the presentation help the audience understand the research? <br>3. Engagement <br>Did the oration make the audience want to know more? <br><br>More information can be found at www.auckland.ac.nz/3minutethesis</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the heart is a very complicated machine<br>an incredibly immensely insane<br>complicated machine and I cannot express<br>possibly the complicatedness of the<br>heart it's made up of millions of heart<br>cells all clumped on top of each other<br>connected together electrically coupled<br>and inside every single one are long<br>long strands of these things called<br>sarir which have proteins in them<br>filaments that contract every time<br>calcium binds to them this is what makes<br>your blood pump around your body and<br>keep you alive every second of every<br>single day where does this calcium come<br>from that binds to these muscles that<br>contract that make you alive they come<br>from this big sack you can think of it<br>as called the psychop plasmic reticulum<br>that wraps around all the filaments and<br>how does the calcium leave the psychop<br>plas reticulum there's this receptor on<br>it this protein called the Ryan Indian<br>receptor and a little bit of calcium<br>that comes from outside of the cell bind<br>to this receptor thus opening the big<br>sack letting all the calcium out and<br>making you live my thesis focuses on<br>modeling the spatial distribution in<br>three dimensions of this receptor this<br>ring receptor I do this using insane<br>amounts of maths and physics and<br>statistics so essentially I take images<br>of rat Hearts over here and turn them<br>into bizarre shapes and colors and<br>graphs and numbers over here then I<br>reverse engineer using those numbers to<br>produce stock mathematically expressed<br>model of a heart so you could have a<br>mathematically described 3D model of<br>what a healthy heart should look like I<br>can then look at diabetic cells cells<br>with heart failure any other kind of<br>illnesses and you can do the same kind<br>of analyses on them and then you can get<br>a mathematical description of these<br>illnesses and compare them with the<br>healthy cells and then you're able to<br>see how how it went wrong and how to fix<br>it and that is how you can fix a broken<br>heart and build a heart<br>this this is application to be developed<br>to to clinics where you can take<br>biopsies of living heart cells and<br>illnesses and you can diagnose without<br>with only looking at the 3D spatial<br>distribution of these hearts of these<br>rining receptors this approach has never<br>ever been taken before and has the<br>potential to be applied to all different<br>proteins and all other kinds of<br>cells it's it's quite amazing let me<br>assure<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
