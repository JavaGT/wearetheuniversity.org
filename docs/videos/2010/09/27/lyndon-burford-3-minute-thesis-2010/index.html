In a 'Thesis Idol' style set-up, the judges commented on the quality of the presentations. Each heat was judged by three people including faculty academics and communications experts.<br>The entrants were judged on the following criteria:<br>1. Communication style <br>Was the thesis topic and its significance communicated in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience? <br>2. Comprehension <br>Did the presentation help the audience understand the research? <br>3. Engagement <br>Did the oration make the audience want to know more? <br><br>More information can be found at www.auckland.ac.nz/3minutethesis</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the most common theory about nuclear<br>disarmament<br>is that nuclear sum is good in theory<br>in practice of course nuclear<br>disarmament is often seen as a pipe<br>dream<br>now this uh goes very nicely with<br>traditional international relations<br>theory which says that essentially<br>human nature is insert appropriate<br>expletive here<br>and as a result we should expect the<br>spread of nuclear weapons and not<br>nuclear disarmament or people getting<br>rid of nuclear weapons so why on earth<br>would a small country<br>put a lot of political capital into<br>promoting nuclear disarmament and really<br>what good does it do well ladies and<br>gentlemen my name is lyndon burford and<br>in the next 150 seconds i will give you<br>the why<br>what and how of my research into this<br>topic for a phd in political studies<br>here at the university of auckland<br>so why study nuclear disarmament well in<br>the 1980s when new zealand became<br>nuclear-free we were shunned by the<br>entire western world<br>when france blew up the rainbow warrior<br>in auckland harbour<br>none of new zealand's friends or allies<br>even acknowledged the incident<br>however in the last 25 years the world<br>has moved a lot closer to new zealand's<br>position<br>than the other way around to the extent<br>that the united states president<br>is now one of the world's leading<br>cheerleaders for nuclear disarmament<br>so the issue is back on the<br>international agenda and it's being<br>taken seriously<br>so what will i be studying exactly well<br>i'll be looking at three countries that<br>don't have nuclear weapons<br>but do have strong policies promoting<br>nuclear disarmament<br>are we looking at why how and with what<br>results<br>they do this my three case study<br>countries are norway<br>a nuclear weapons ally through its<br>membership in nato<br>new zealand a self-declared nuclear<br>weapon-free zone and mexico<br>host of the world's first ever regional<br>nuclear weapon-free zone<br>now how will i be conducting this<br>research well i'll be carrying out field<br>research in my three case study<br>countries<br>i'll be conducting interviews with<br>governmental non-governmental<br>and academic experts i'll be applying a<br>constructivist<br>theoretical framework which is to say<br>rather than simply focusing on material<br>factors such as<br>military strength or the economy i'll be<br>looking at how the international<br>social environment affects the behaviour<br>of states<br>now ladies and gentlemen this research<br>is vitally important for two key reasons<br>first because it is<br>novel now the international community<br>has set the goal of eliminating nuclear<br>weapons but most<br>scholars in this field tend to study why<br>states build nuclear weapons<br>not why they get rid of them secondly<br>it's important because of its relevance<br>to today's world<br>in the post-9 11 world there is a<br>growing consensus on the need for<br>nuclear disarmament<br>even arch realists such as kissinger now<br>are calling for nuclear disarmament<br>saying that we desperately need nuclear<br>disarmament<br>in order to ensure international<br>security my sincere hope is<br>that in some small way this research<br>will help to contribute to the goal of<br>eliminating nuclear weapons<br>sound idealistic naive that's what<br>people were saying about new zealand 25</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
