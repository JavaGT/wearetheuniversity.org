accurate.</p><p>from The Faculty of science measuring<br>the ion Flux Of An elect<br>electrochemically actuated conduc poly<br>using<br>everyone it was a bit of a mouthful so I<br>changed it a bit um this<br>my name is cos malaza I'm from the<br>Department of Chemistry I'm a second<br>year PhD student and what I'll talk to<br>you about today are two very exciting<br>topics live onor chip Diagnostics and<br>artificial muscles I worked on these two<br>using a specialized tool called scanning<br>onon conductance microscopy and this is<br>it right here I built it during my first<br>year and I'll talk a bit more about it<br>later on but much more important are the<br>two applications that I worked on using<br>it so so first up live on a chip<br>Diagnostics this is a technology that's<br>all about making doctors Mobile for some<br>very important reasons I'll explain to<br>you how this technology Works how the<br>sicm fits into the picture and I'll show<br>you some the results that we've been<br>getting the second topic is artificial<br>muscles this is all about restoring and<br>improving movement in people from all<br>walks of life I'll explain to you how<br>actes work how the sicm fits in and<br>again show you some new<br>results so we started with a lab on a<br>chip this is about the point of care<br>diagnostics for the developing world and<br>I can introduce this importance to you<br>with one number that number is 4<br>million each year there are 4 million<br>neonatal deaths a neonatal death means<br>that within the first 28 days since the<br>baby's birth it dies 99% of these deaths<br>are are in high outside of high- inome<br>countries so we're talking about places<br>like subsaharan Africa and South and<br>Central<br>Asia there's a multitude of reasons<br>behind this number a major problem is<br>inadequate diagnosis you can imagine in<br>a country with a fragile Health Care<br>System that's understaffed and that<br>has poor equipment and on top of that<br>it's favoring Urban dwellers and<br>privileged Elites so that you end up<br>with really logistical nightmares like a<br>refugee camp where they are far moved<br>from a hospital and so as a healthc care<br>provider how do you do rapid diagnosis<br>to these people at the point of<br>care and one solution might be the lab<br>on a chip this is a technology that<br>miniaturizes lab tests to bring them<br>outside of the hospital to allow the<br>healthcare providers to do this work in<br>the field so here we have a<br>prototype you can see the size is<br>designed to fill within the palm of your<br>hand it's designed to be lightweight and<br>after you apply a sample say a jop of<br>saliva it can be read out with a<br>portable Computing device like a laptop<br>or even a<br>smartphone and now I'll introduce to you<br>how this works in Greater detail so here<br>we have the Prototype down here and at<br>the heart of the device we have this<br>component which is made up of conducting<br>polymer<br>spots what do these consist of so to<br>actually make it you start with a<br>chemical called the monomer and you link<br>them up through a process called<br>electropolymerization so that these<br>deposit into these spots here that's the<br>first step the second step is called<br>functionalization and this will allow us<br>to make a link between the conducting<br>polymer and the disease that we're<br>looking for the third step is attaching<br>the compliment ment DNA that's actually<br>going to be used in the analysis and<br>these are all part of the sensor design<br>the fourth and final part will be the<br>actual sensing event when we detect what<br>we're looking<br>for now all around the world researchers<br>are working on all parts of this problem<br>even within the research group that I'm<br>part of my particular PhD focuses on<br>this part right here of the basic<br>electropolymerization and these are the<br>chemicals that I work with the details<br>the reason that I focus on this is<br>because there is no good way currently<br>to actually do electropolymerization<br>this first step at very small scales so<br>how do we solve this problem and I'll<br>tell you by way of analogy consider how<br>an artist paints so she might have a<br>tool like a paintbrush uses certain ink<br>the movement is through a hand and the<br>result are dabs or Strokes of paint now<br>what we do is analogous just 10,000<br>times smaller so so instead a of a<br>paintbrush we use a glass pipet that's<br>been pulled to a very very fine tip<br>that's 10,000 times smaller than a<br>paintbrush we then fill this pipet with<br>the monomer ink th the chemical that I<br>described on the previous<br>slide and then we move it down using a<br>device called a piso actuator which is<br>capable of very fine precise movement so<br>we lower this pipet towards the surface<br>that we want to draw on and then the<br>fourth final step by applying a voltage<br>we can actually draw the polymer onto<br>the surface and these are the results<br>that we've been getting so we can vary<br>the size we can control whether or not<br>they're solid or Hollow and we can<br>actually position them with great<br>prision into arrays which is very<br>important for lab on a<br>chip how does this compare with the<br>existing literature um we are the first<br>to demonstrate this technique at such a<br>small scale so we're pretty excited<br>about these results and why do I keep<br>talking about small things well it's<br>because Size Matters some of you might<br>recognize this this is a single human<br>hair it's been magnified 2,000 times and<br>I want to compare that those spots that<br>I just showed you on the previous slide<br>how do they line up well it's this<br>little red dot right<br>here that's the kind of scale that we're<br>working<br>at so why is this important because we<br>can now do high density work so that on<br>a labant chip you have the potential to<br>put down thousand of these spots and<br>really have a broad range of Diagnostics<br>that are<br>possible and at this point I want to<br>introduce to you more the technology<br>that's behind this Electro spotting so<br>the sicm is a fairly rare instrument<br>there's less than 100 in the world ours<br>is the only one in New Zealand um to<br>actually buy one is about a quarter of a<br>million dollars there's a company that<br>will sell it to you but um my supervisor<br>thought I should Channel some C<br>Ingenuity and put one together myself<br>save some money so it took a lot of<br>systems engineering we started with the<br>part that moves so the pzo crystal<br>actuator on top of that we need some<br>stages to mount everything together<br>including the<br>sample the PIP head and it's Associated<br>wiring is very important then we have uh<br>Vision to actually see what's going on a<br>high magnification camera it all needs<br>to be very well isolated so we have the<br>whole setup floating on an air table and<br>it's also enclosed in a fad cage which<br>blocks out electrical noise and finally<br>it's all computer controlled so I did a<br>lot of computer programming to control<br>all<br>this and uh have to mention the<br>wonderful talented uh supervisors and<br>collaborators that are helping<br>me also an important detail uh the glass<br>pie pets so to actually make these you<br>start with a capillary tube you heat the<br>Middle with a laser and you snap them<br>apart you end up with a very small tip<br>and here you see it from the side if we<br>tilt it and then look down it you can<br>see just how small it is this is again<br>about uh 100 times smaller than a single<br>strand of hair and very recently just in<br>the past few weeks we've also been<br>working on double barreled pipets which<br>we very excited to start work with<br>because they'll open up a whole new sort<br>of range of possibilities but that'll be<br>results for next year I'll move on now<br>to the second part of the talk which is<br>about artificial<br>muscles now why do we need artificial<br>muscles I'll go through a few<br>examples here's an ason not in outer<br>space he's doing very complicated and<br>stressful work and 80% of his energy he<br>has to spend just on moving the<br>suit soldiers going into battle carry as<br>much as 45<br>kg this results in half of Battlefield<br>injuries that was a very surprising<br>figure for me when I first saw that and<br>for 30% of veterans it results in<br>lifelong chronic<br>pain and finally perhaps a bit closer to<br>home after the age of 30 every decade we<br>lose between 5 to 10% muscle mass M so<br>that by the time we HD you know 80 years<br>old we might only have half the strength<br>we once did resulting in very diminished<br>quality of<br>life so what we're trying to do is use<br>those conducting polymers to develop<br>artificial muscles that are thin and<br>lightweight and that's really our Focus<br>there thin and lightweight what I show<br>here in these first two images are the<br>materials that we've developed here's<br>the cross-section and you can see again<br>just how thin they are this is an<br>animation from another research group<br>showing how these um conduant poers can<br>actually<br>move now how does this work at the<br>fundamental level it's all has to do<br>with ion flux an ion is a atom or<br>molecule that is charged so positive<br>charge or negative charge and when we<br>make these conducting polymers you'll<br>have some of this ions embedded what we<br>then do is we apply a charge the system<br>is unhappy in this case and wants to<br>equilibrate so we're going to have<br>positive ions coming in going into the<br>material and causing it to expand this<br>is why it grows in the opposite case you<br>might have some that are small and able<br>to leave so that when we apply a<br>negative charge they'll actually cause<br>the polymer to<br>shrink now that's the basic idea but in<br>terms of the details of this ion<br>movement it's still not well understood<br>and this stands in the way of developing<br>artificial muscles so for example how<br>quickly does ion Flex occur that will<br>tell us how quick the muscle can move in<br>what quantities does the ionx occur<br>that'll tell us how strong the muscle<br>can be and how does it correlate with<br>actuation now to solve this<br>problem the idea was fairly<br>straightforward we would just park our<br>tip right above the conducting polymer<br>as it moves and we would observe the ion<br>flux in practice it turns out that<br>nobody has actually done this in the<br>scientific literature before so we had<br>to solve a lot of problems like custom<br>components and uh new phenomena<br>I can't go into details right now I'm<br>going to skip to the results here's our<br>characterization of it and I'll take<br>these one by one so we start up here<br>this is the oh this is the voltage that<br>we applied to make the uh conducting<br>polymers move what you have in Part B<br>are the results you would get with a<br>conventional technique part C is our new<br>technique and you can really see a much<br>greater level of detail you can see<br>transients and you can<br>quantitatively describe the on F very<br>well what we did in part D is we used<br>another instrument which is called an<br>atomic Force microscope to measure the<br>height change very precisely and by<br>lining these two<br>up so the underlying mechanism and the<br>resulting actuation we can really Define<br>regions of this Behavior really<br>well so I'm going to wrap things up what<br>have we done we've looked at using<br>conducting polymer technology for<br>healthcare in the first part I talked<br>about a Labon chip chip devices with<br>applications to Portable diagnosis and<br>how we developed a new way of electr<br>polymerizing very tiny<br>spots in the second part we looked at<br>artificial<br>muscles and how we are thoroughly<br>characterizing the iron flux that is<br>responsible for<br>it so that said I thank you for the<br>opportunity to speak here and also all<br>the wonderful people and organizations<br>that support<br>me<br>mention<br>right the strategy behind that to do<br>many tests on one ship or is the<br>strategy to be able to<br>many measurements of the same thing for<br>cases<br>right yeah I think that's a very good<br>question and the answer is probably a<br>bit of column a bit of column B um when<br>you're working with things as such a<br>small scale repeatability can be a big<br>problem so definitely having the same<br>measurement done maybe 100 times and<br>trying to obtain say an average is<br>definitely something to do but also<br>having the possibility to have multiple<br>tests in the same<br>question<br>do oh right ah very good question yeah<br>that was a big problem where we had some<br>surfaces like glass that just have the<br>droplet that's contained within the pipe<br>head all just sort of spell out and then<br>even though your tip is a certain size<br>you end up making a much larger spot so<br>we had to do some work on uh the surface<br>controlling so the hydrophobicity of it<br>and so forth and um also it helps if the<br>walls of the PIP pad itself are<br>hydrophobic so that the liquid can creep<br>up so that's definitely an issue with<br>yeah um in terms of stability I can only<br>comment on the first part which is the<br>electropolymerization and then there's<br>subsequent steps to lay that down um it<br>has to do first with the nature of the<br>surface that's underneath on some<br>surfaces it'll simply flake off after a<br>while and it also has to do with the<br>number of Cycles you do so it might<br>respond very well on the first couple of<br>Cycles but then on the 50th one for<br>example it it wouldn't do a very good<br>all<br>get um I think versus micro fluidx it's<br>a bit of um system integration where<br>part of that would actually play into<br>this<br>technology um in terms of conducting<br>polymers I think the field has been<br>working on it for about 20 years and<br>it's getting to a point where we really<br>have a lot of options for um you know<br>the types of conducting polymers you can<br>use the demonstrated diseases that is<br>capable of looking at um and certainly<br>there's there's a lot more interest<br>these days<br>from uh you know corporations and also<br>institutes that do a lot of sponsorship<br>for example Bill and M the gates um are<br>sponsoring live on chip projects all<br>around the world so I think it's<br>definitely getting close to the point<br>exciting<br>right oh absolutely cost yeah um there's<br>a big there's a big gap between doing<br>this research in the lab when you have<br>chemicals that you know can cost a<br>couple hundred dollars and actually<br>getting to the point where you have a<br>device<br>that I think for it to actually be<br>successful it has to be less Le than<br>$100 um and we're not quite there yet<br>but there has there have been some<br>companies like uh there's a company<br>called agilant that have started<br>commercializing this so they actually do<br>sell some very basic lab on chip devices<br>so I think that's a promising first step<br>and that they can actually see a market<br>that um I highly recommend buying<br>it if you have the<br>means but no it was good fund actually<br>it's a challenge and uh it's good to try<br>to do it myself but in terms of uh you<br>know when you have a company that's been<br>developing for 10 years and you have a<br>whole team behind it versus trying to do<br>it in one year and then getting on with<br>the rest of the PHD but do you think<br>capabilities<br>inst<br>yeah I think that's a that's a good<br>point so from day one we knew sort of<br>the application that we were going<br>towards and we were able to tailor it<br>towards that so even if we bought one<br>off the shelf we would still have to do<br>further work to modify it to our<br>purposes<br>yeah</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
