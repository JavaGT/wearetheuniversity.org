for the past six months or<br>so so today going to be presenting what<br>I've done so far my project is entitled<br>The characterization of the globous<br>padus and vental pal and huntingt<br>disease but before we get started let's<br>talk a little bit about Huntington's<br>disease<br>itself now Huntington's disease is a<br>neurodegenerative disorder now what that<br>basically means is it leads to the death<br>of cells within our brain now it's also<br>got a genetic component which of which<br>means that if you have the gene that<br>encodes for hunting disease you're<br>likely to pass it on Next Generation so<br>it's<br>inherited now if you're unfortunate<br>enough to develop Huntington's disease<br>there are three characteristic hallmar<br>symptoms that are very typical of this<br>disorder this includes Progressive<br>involuntary CH form movements now<br>Huntington's disease is also known as<br>Huntington's Korea Korea is Latin for<br>danike so what actually had happens in<br>some patients is that they start<br>developing these danike movements that<br>they're unable to control that becomes<br>very difficult in the later stages of<br>the disease in addition to that they can<br>also suffer from cognitive decline and<br>changes in their<br>personality this disease can also be<br>further classified into affecting<br>predominantly motor pathway so this is<br>more so affecting movement or more so<br>affecting mood so this is the<br>personality aspect of the disease it can<br>also be a combination of<br>both what's important to know is that<br>this dise predominantly affects an area<br>of the brain known as the basil ganglia<br>so what is the basil gangli well it's<br>best to look at it in the context with<br>the brain itself so let's Zoom right in<br>if I take my brain a bird's ey view<br>looking straight down on it cut it in<br>half so I have the two hemispheres and<br>then cut one hemisphere in half in this<br>orientation this is known as a coronal<br>section which is what you see here in<br>the gray now this side of uh this side<br>is a representation of a coronal section<br>from a patient who does not have<br>Huntington's disease whereas this side<br>is Huntington's disease positive now<br>straight away just by looking you can<br>see there's a size difference the<br>Huntington's disease side of the brain<br>is significantly smaller this is known<br>as atropy so shinkage of the tissue but<br>what I want to draw your attention to is<br>this area in the center this is known as<br>the basil ganger now the basil ganga is<br>a group of structures in the middle of<br>the brain that play a major role in the<br>initiation and execution of movement<br>so what I want to draw your attention to<br>with that knowledge in mind is two<br>specific areas in the basil ganga the<br>first one is known as the glob paladis<br>now this structure plays a predominant<br>role in the initiation of<br>movement so it's more associated with<br>the motor pathways in our brain however<br>in contrast to that the other structure<br>below it known as the vual pad plays<br>more of a role in the mood pathway in<br>the brain so more related to how we feel<br>we good or bad what gives us a a reward<br>what makes us feel good so with regards<br>to Huntington's disease not a lot is<br>knowing about these structures and what<br>happens in these areas not a lot of<br>detailed analysis has actually occurred<br>in the human brain in these regions in<br>particular the vental padum itself<br>hasn't really been looked at in any<br>neurological disorder alone so this<br>brings us to my aim to figure out what<br>we don't know about these two regions<br>and how they are ected by hunting this<br>disease how am I going to be looking at<br>this well the first thing to do is<br>figure out what's going on at the<br>cellular level is there an extent of is<br>there a cell loss in these areas of the<br>brain so I want to look at the extent of<br>the cell loss in these regions it's<br>already been documented there is a<br>little bit of cell loss in the glob<br>palis but the extent of it is unknown<br>how sever is<br>it in addition to that I want to look at<br>the specific subtypes of the cell lost<br>in these regions so maybe if we can<br>specify what groups of cells are lost we<br>can possibly develop Target therapeutic<br>intervention strategies to get these<br>specific<br>cells most importantly try to see if<br>there's a link with what's going on in<br>these regions with the symptoms of the<br>disease itself so is any extent of the<br>cell loss in the globe's pelus region<br>licked with the extent of the motor<br>symptoms that these patients suffer from<br>and likewise are any changes IND<br>eventual palad linked with the extented<br>the mood symptoms associated with the<br>disease what I want to reiterate though<br>is that for the first time we're looking<br>at these regions in the human brain in<br>such a significant depth this is why<br>it's the extent of the pH<br>project so how am I going about doing<br>all of this well the first thing I'm<br>doing at the moment is characterizing<br>the major cell populations in these<br>regions using a technique know as imun<br>chemistry so what is that well basically<br>we have our whole body is made of cells<br>right but the our gut cells for example<br>are different to our brain cells and<br>what separates them is that they have<br>different markers on them that Define<br>what they are what they look like and<br>what they do we can take advantage of<br>this property and actually Target<br>specific cell groups using those markers<br>so we can have these proteins that b<br>specific cell types and attach to these<br>proteins are label so this label in my<br>case is a color changing product so if a<br>cell is found there is a color change<br>and then we can visualize it under the<br>microscope in addition to that I want to<br>quantify these cells so once I can see<br>them I want to see what's happened to<br>the total number of the cells in these<br>regions in the hunting human brains that<br>I'm looking at and compare them with<br>corresponding controls now to quantify<br>all of this I'm using a technique nor<br>theology now what is theology basically<br>it's a fancy cell counting tool<br>it gives an unbiased estimate of the<br>total cell number through an entire<br>region of a given volume now what does<br>that mean okay our brain is three<br>dimensional which means if we're going<br>to do any sort of cell counting analysis<br>we want to get a number that's actually<br>relevant to the whole region of interest<br>because we need a free perspective<br>that's what this techniqu theology takes<br>advantage of it involves a fancy<br>microscope and some fancy software but<br>what's the beauty of it is that it gives<br>you a threedimensional answer and that's<br>directly relevant us as human<br>beings so what does theology require<br>well basically you need the full<br>uninterrupted region of Interest now the<br>globous padus isn't just one single area<br>rly plac in the brain it actually<br>occupies a long region which is<br>highlighted by this volume that are<br>placed in the middle of the brain it's<br>threedimensional now if we think of the<br>globous pelus as a big volume of<br>something say for example a big block of<br>cookie dough okay and if we consider<br>cells as little chocolate chips and I<br>wanted to quantify in a big block of<br>cookie dough the the total number of<br>chocolate chips without actually having<br>to spend my whole life counting them the<br>best way to actually do it which is what<br>serology does is I section the whole<br>cookie dough okay into different slices<br>and say I take um every 10th or 20th<br>section count the number of chocolate<br>chips and just that those particular<br>slices mult it out by the total volume<br>of the region of interest and that<br>allows me to give an accurate unbiased<br>estimate of the total number of cells<br>without having to count the whole entire<br>area that would be about 10 PhD projects<br>put<br>together this technique also relies on<br>having clearly defined regions so what<br>you need to do is the glob this is just<br>one structure surrounded by a whole lot<br>of other structures you need to separate<br>it out from everything else so you're<br>only counting that region of interest<br>and not accidentally counting anywhere<br>else in addition to that you also want<br>to know where the GP and VP I'll call<br>them the GP and VP from now start and<br>end so what you need a good markers to<br>actually delineate where they start and<br>where they end so that's what I've been<br>doing so far sorting out these<br>boundaries and one one such boundary<br>marker that I've been using so far to<br>characterize my boundaries is known as<br>andent now it's a marker of one of the<br>typical cells that dies in hunting<br>disease but in my case it's actually<br>very good and and labeling a section of<br>the globous pelus and the vop Pelin now<br>these panels here a b c and d have been<br>taken between these two regions these<br>areas of the brain so I've just I've<br>collected probably about 5 to 600<br>sections and I've just taken four random<br>sections from them but what I want to<br>illustrate is that through using markers<br>like in keyin which is that amuno<br>chemical marking technique I was talking<br>about before I'm able to Define where<br>the ventral Paladin starts so that's<br>this little brown over here so that's 7<br>mm into the series that I've sectioned<br>through 9.8 mm in the vental Palm is<br>still present but the globous padus is<br>now starting to make its appearance as<br>well however if we go 18.2 mm into the<br>series The vental padum is no longer<br>there so from this alone I already know<br>the ventral padum only occupies a few<br>millim of brain so if I'm going to look<br>at this region I need to be really<br>careful because the tissue is so<br>incredibly precious a small region in<br>contrast to that though 25 mm into the<br>series The globous pbus is still present<br>so this means in contrast to the vadum<br>the GP actually occupies 2 to three cm<br>of tissue so this is giving me a fair<br>idea as to spacially what I need to<br>count so this these sections are taken<br>from a control case but if we compare<br>that with a Huntington's case to the top<br>panel is that same control and the<br>bottom region is the Huntington's case<br>you can already see there is a<br>significant difference<br>um for example if we look at this region<br>here which is the Globus P which is the<br>Globus padus in the Huntington's case<br>and compare it with this region here you<br>can see not only is the label lighter<br>which means there are fewer cells being<br>labeled but it's also thinner which<br>means there's significant shrinkage of<br>the area that's just this type area<br>highl here so macroscopically these are<br>just photos taken this is not a<br>microscope or anything like that just<br>macroscopically alone using these<br>markers you can see significant changes<br>in the glob this is quite exciting<br>because clearly this means when I get to<br>the cellular level there's going to be a<br>lot of<br>difference another such marker I'm<br>looking at is called substance P now<br>this Mark labels another region of the<br>Globus padus it's divided into two<br>regions an internal segment and external<br>segment but what you can see this is the<br>same sort of seup here are the control<br>SE sections and here's the Huntington<br>sections the substance P marker labels<br>this area here which is another region<br>of the glob pelis it's very clear and<br>it's clearly separated from this region<br>here so I'm going to have a really good<br>region of interest that I can see<br>clearly same thing is over here the<br>Huntington stue same thing however at<br>this magnification we can't really see a<br>difference in this region um based on<br>this marker alone so this is why we now<br>need to go to the cular level so these<br>blue blobs all over the place over here<br>are actually brain cells now they're<br>labeled with the specific blue D and I'm<br>sure you can actually see is that there<br>are these very large Blue cells now<br>these large Blue cells are actually<br>neurons so they're the brain cells and<br>they're localized to the globous palous<br>region so they're known as pal neurons<br>however all of these little cells I<br>don't know what they are I can't really<br>see it as magnification anything even<br>going up in magnification if we just<br>look look at one particular sell you<br>really can't differentiate the<br>difference between all these little<br>cells so this marker that I'm using is<br>going to label my palal neurons and<br>that's one of the types of neurons that<br>be marking because it's a very good<br>generic marker clearly though I need to<br>zoom in even further because I want to<br>look at subtypes of cells so this is<br>when we get more specific markers such<br>as par Algin now par Algin is a calcium<br>Bing protein now we all drink calcium<br>because calcium um is something needed<br>for us to survive it's what helps our<br>muscles work for example now what you<br>can do is take advantage of the um of<br>calcium and actually Target particular<br>protein that b to calcium and Target it<br>into different cells so what we're doing<br>here is labeling specific calcium<br>binding protein cells with this marker<br>and here we're now zooming in on the<br>subt so that's what all these Z regions<br>are here we can zoom in even further<br>specific calcium binding protein cells<br>with this marker and here we're now<br>zooming in on the subt so that's what<br>all these that regions are here we can<br>zoom in even further this is what I'm<br>going to be counting under the<br>microscope what's interesting is at this<br>magnification you can even see the<br>projections so these are the little arms<br>that these cells um have that make that<br>make contact with other cells and this<br>is actually how they communicate with<br>one another so hopefully even along the<br>way I'll be able to look at the<br>communication between the cells as well<br>so what have I done so far well<br>apparently characterized the boundaries<br>required for my future studies so um<br>using this markers known as in substance<br>P pretty much without these markers I<br>would have no idea where to count I<br>would not be able to stereologically<br>analyze my data effectively as well as<br>that I'm now zooming in and looking at<br>particular cell types for example<br>characterizing those large big blue pal<br>neurons within thisle St and I'm zooming<br>in now further and looking at particular<br>subtypes so that's the AL Mark I was<br>showing that's more specific for some<br>cells so what's next pretty much I'm<br>going to be carrying out the very<br>similar staining procedure that looking<br>at more markers getting more specific<br>cells and eventually as of next month<br>I'm actually starting the theological<br>analysis I'm starting the counting<br>procedure in the long run i' actually<br>like to look at the different grades of<br>Huntington disease cases that I have now<br>early stages of the Huntington of<br>Huntington is actually known as grade<br>zero so that's when there isn't much<br>cell loss and it ranges of different<br>grades sequentially up to four when<br>there's pronounced cell loss and there's<br>a lot of cell death so if we can<br>actually look at what specific cell<br>types are lost along these different<br>grades of the disease Maybe we can have<br>early Target interventions and maybe<br>preserve X cell type that's lost in<br>grade zero region and POS possibly<br>preserve these cells have pharmaceutical<br>targets to those in particular later on<br>maybe a different cell type is loss<br>maybe we can preserve that cell type in<br>that um part of the<br>disease so in summary huntingt doesn't<br>have a cure this is why we studying it<br>this is why our lab group is looking at<br>it and my area of expertise is going to<br>be the pal and mutual palad that's why<br>I'm looking at them in detail and<br>hopefully by the end of my studies I'll<br>be able to get a better understanding of<br>the anatomical changes in these areas in<br>the Huntington cases and ultimately link<br>it to the symptoms is there a<br>correlation with the extent of the<br>symptoms involved so I'd like to ackn my<br>supervisors Dr Henry B and Professor<br>Richard Paul and the funding are receed<br>from the University of or doctoral<br>scholarship and my beautiful neuro<br>Anatomy group thank you very much for<br>listening<br>which which<br>it's actually combination but thear Sy<br>is the so that happens quite early on<br>but later on in the disease there is<br>more pronounced mood symptoms that you<br>can pick up so it is a it's a bit of a<br>not it's progression as the C continu<br>and as those projections to the<br>different<br>areas as far as I know don't know it's<br>more it's more combination case but<br>obviously the the motor symptoms are<br>more<br>early<br>assum um do you mean since the is a larg<br>structure do you think Mo would go first<br>um see most likely the problem is even<br>though the vent pel is a smaller<br>structure it plays a role in a big<br>pathway so if the connections to the<br>ventel are incredibly important we can't<br>rule out that maybe the mood symptoms<br>are less um strong or less early on or<br>anything like that we can't say that at<br>the moment um what I can say though is<br>since the H disease is mainly um a<br>disease of the basil gambl which is<br>typically involved with<br>movement the Imp on movements<br>we<br>possibly would<br>to so what would be the symptom that's<br>symptom I would say Sy is more typically<br>recognized by I'm assuming<br>by on but since it's a genetic disease<br>and the person now tends to know if they<br>do have the gene for the disease um the<br>motorcycle would probably be the first<br>onms<br>you compare your<br>control of many you look at before you<br>get confidence that you know what's<br>going on in those that's the problem<br>with hunting disease it's very very<br>variable science speaking the typical<br>sample size where you can have a decent<br>comparison for any sort of study in<br>general is six so if you have a sample<br>size of six um Huntington cases versus<br>six control<br>you are able to compare them but this<br>disease is a little bit more special we<br>really need to up the sample size and<br>that's actually why the study of this<br>disease is so time consuming because<br>there are times where we have plenty of<br>contous cases but not enough controls<br>because we don't get a lot of um control<br>brains donated to the center of brain<br>research here<br>so it's a single Gene disease yes but<br>the symptoms are so variable that we<br>really need a h to account for<br>individual<br>variability<br>coration so you guys<br>of try to fix<br>it probably quite a while because the<br>disease affects so many different areas<br>as we're now finding out the amount of<br>time it takes to actually study one<br>region is quite exensive I mean I'm<br>looking at a region of the brain that's<br>only about this big the is only this big<br>but people are looking at regions of the<br>entire cortex but that takes just as<br>much time so if we have plenty of people<br>working on the disease we probably move<br>towards a answer as to how it works<br>first and go on to the cures so that's<br>why we've got people working on the<br>genetics we've got people working on the<br>human tissue we've got people working on<br>animal models of the disease and if we<br>can<br>collectively come together which is sort<br>of what our group does then we'll<br>approach an answer faster there is we<br>are progressing quite quickly as<br>patients are now becoming more aware<br>that their future Generations are likely<br>to inherit the gene it's not a<br>spontaneous disease like Alim or<br>Parkinson's disease so with that in mind<br>would got more I guess more energy<br>behind us from the patients that have<br>more<br>um globally speaking the rate limiting<br>step is public awareness if people don't<br>know much about the disease and don't<br>recognize that they have the disease<br>then their future Generations when they<br>develop disease they won't know much<br>about it either so the key part globally<br>is education and then if people are more<br>inclined to understand that the best<br>thing we can do is work on postmortem<br>tissue so we need to go to the source to<br>find the problem then maybe that would<br>if people are more you know people<br>encourag to<br>that would help our research one of my<br>rate limiting steps is the number of<br>cases so there's I'm at a point now<br>where I'm actually waiting for control<br>cases to come through so I can process<br>as I said we're working in<br>collaborations with other groups we've<br>got some groups working with MRI studies<br>that are measuring volume loss in so<br>that's one type of stud you can look at<br>you can't really look at individual cell<br>L like individual cells in a living<br>human being um that's why we have to<br>because the techniques that we use<br>require a lot of tissue processing so<br>you can't really zoom into individual<br>cells but you can look at General tissue<br>um tissue loss in In Living patients you<br>can also do Behavioral Studies um so the<br>level of cognitive decline and the<br>impact on personality is being studied<br>by psychologists for example so we get a<br>lot of data from those living patients<br>that are going through the disease as<br>they progress through in relation to<br>those two areas and you can also do<br>motor testing like General Behavior like<br>what impact it has on the mo side of<br>things but science wise if we're going<br>to the cells if we're really looking at<br>we yeah can you<br>actually yes you can structures yes<br>because the resolution of M just<br>continues to increase as technology gets<br>better and better um there's also<br>different forms of M so you can actually<br>color code these regions now live in<br>patients as well um having said that<br>though that's about as far as you go you<br>can differentiate the structures really<br>can't get be on there as far as<br>it<br>the control center um of the basil game<br>players known as the strien now this<br>area has been extensive studied by many<br>groups we've got the proportion of C<br>we've got a threedimensional look at<br>that region they perform theological<br>analysis in that area now yes we've got<br>that region okay but there's there's<br>connections to so many other regions<br>that ultimately relates to the cortex<br>and T you to move so the the Stan says<br>um I want to move and then the rain the<br>cortex says I'm going to move so what<br>we're trying to do now is piece together<br>these parts of the puzzle so the direct<br>output regions of this main area that's<br>been studied this control center is the<br>glob pelis so now I'm the mix in line to<br>detail these regions and someone else is<br>detailing another region called the<br>felus someone else is going to be<br>detailing the region for the sub Subic<br>nucleus people are looking at the cortex<br>at the same time so if we colle<br>collectively just piece everything<br>together and because Huntington's<br>disease affects a<br>circuit hopefully if we work this out<br>this out this out and this out and this<br>out we'll get a better pict fix the<br>whole movement pathway so I'm the mixed<br>analysis that's that's the ultimate goal<br>CU then we're actually going to<br>diseas</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
