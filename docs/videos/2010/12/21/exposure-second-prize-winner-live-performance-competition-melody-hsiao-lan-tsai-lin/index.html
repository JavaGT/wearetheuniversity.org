guitar Peter doisy<br>he's a master of Music student and will<br>be performing with me this evening I<br>have chosen to perform a different<br>composition from my research topic um<br>because I decided to save East Wind in<br>as a premere for my final doctoral<br>recital so this evening um instead of<br>East Wind in ALA my presentation title<br>sea my research explores the years of<br>East Asian musical elements in<br>contemporary flute compositions<br>concentrating on the musical parallels<br>with the Japanese bambo flute shakuhachi<br>music the increasing Global cultural<br>flow and advances in electronic<br>technology since the mid 20th century<br>have fostered an ever closer<br>relationship between eastern and western<br>musical cultures manifested particularly<br>in the work of composers who have<br>integrated one one culture into the<br>another music written for the flute is a<br>fascinating example of this<br>phenomenon the shakuhachi Japanese<br>vertical Bamboo Flute became<br>increasingly popular due to their unique<br>tber and performance techniques the<br>shahaji is one of the most recognizable<br>traditional Japanese instruments<br>celebrated internationally at regular<br>events such as the World shakah haachi<br>Festival according a corresponding<br>academic interest has resulted in an<br>even higher profile for this instrument<br>research conducted since the 1990s has<br>demonstrated how contemporary flute<br>composition has been influenced by<br>Japanese flute music and performance<br>techniques for example in the works by<br>Japanese composer toru<br>takamitsu takam born in 1930 and died in<br>1996 is one of the most celebrated<br>modern Japanese composer and was<br>virtually self-taught as a musician he<br>was inspired by duzi Meson and John Cage<br>composers who were themselves deeply<br>influenced by Musical and philosophical<br>traditions of Asian culture taku often<br>Incorporated Japanese musical elements<br>in his compositions and had the unique<br>ability to create a sound world that is<br>west for this presentation I have chosen<br>to perform Tak mitus through the sea for<br>alter flute and guitar to demonstrate<br>aspects of traditional Japanese music<br>found in contemporary flute composition<br>this piece was composed in<br>1981 commissioned by Green piece for the<br>save the well campaign it was inspired<br>by Herman Melville's novel mob dig or<br>the whale this composition is in three<br>movements the first titled the night the<br>second movement is called mid dick and<br>the final movement Cape<br>Cod through my research I have found<br>three main Japanese elements in this<br>composition the first is the use of<br>shakuhachi like performance<br>techniques as you can see in this<br>example the opening of the first<br>movement starts with a hollow tone and<br>and takam to specify the alternative<br>fingering for this effect the same D is<br>played with two different fingerings as<br>now the timber of the hollow tone is<br>reminiscent of shakah hai's pitch<br>bending effect I brought my own um<br>plastic shakah haaji and attempting to<br>like<br>the next example shows the use of finger<br>tremolos also known as fingered vibrat<br>or Timber TRS finger tremolos is a<br>performance technique that use<br>alternative fingerings to play these the<br>same note this is an excerpt from the<br>second movement of toward the sea and as<br>you can see the same high sea can be<br>fingerings there also frequent use of<br>flatter tongue in toward the Sea and the<br>same effect is also similar to shako<br>Hatchi music here is an excerpt of<br>shakach flat Tong um taken from turun<br>Hashi and here's the way Shak Tak me to<br>incorporate the flatter tongue the first<br>movement of toward the<br>sea hopefully you can hear some musical<br>similarities here all these performance<br>techniques are used to add subtle color<br>and Timber changes to a single ndee<br>which leads to my next Japanese element<br>sea the importance of a single note is a<br>key element in all traditional Japanese<br>music especially in shakah haachi music<br>the shahaji was exclusively used by the<br>kuso mons of emptiness in the Ado period<br>during the mid 17th century they used<br>the shakuhachi as an integral part of<br>their spiritual practice in Zen Buddhism<br>shakuhachi playing is closely related to<br>two of the main aims of Zen Buddhism<br>suen ichino which is to achieve Oneness<br>in breathing and meditation and ich jutu<br>which is to reach bhood with a single<br>sound through controlled inhalation and<br>exhalation one can become sensitive to<br>the subtlest nuances of a single note<br>and in the process create a still and<br>focused mind takimit firmly believes<br>this practice and further suggested<br>quote the universe is explored in a<br>single sound so with some exaggeration I<br>might say God dwells in a single sound<br>end quote toward the sea each n has its<br>own unique tonal Dynamic and tal<br>variation there are numerous incidents<br>throughout the piece where a long note<br>is colored by Dynamic and tempal changes<br>the sense of timelessness in this<br>composition closely paralleled with<br>shakuhachi music as you can he we<br>demonstrate for you um the ending of um<br>of this first movement and you can see<br>that each note has a different time brow<br>and<br>dynamic so please remember to listen for<br>the satone color changes in the out of<br>part and the guitar part when Peter and<br>I play this piece later for you the<br>final Japanese element found in t the<br>sea is the importance of Silence the<br>rests form an integral part of the whole<br>composition and this is parallel to<br>traditional Japanese musical Aesthetics<br>in that the silences need to be felt<br>strongly in order to sustain musical<br>tension and<br>creativity the concept of time in<br>traditional Japanese music reflects the<br>deeply rooted Zen religion beliefs<br>within Japanese culture the ambiguity<br>between existence and non-existence<br>Perfection and imperfection and sound<br>and noise reflects the transitory nature<br>of Japanese musical art sound and<br>silences are not clearly defined and<br>constantly flow between one another as<br>Richard pgam explained the concept of ma<br>an important element in all Japanese<br>music means an interval between the two<br>um space social or temporal things and<br>events in classical solo shakuhachi<br>music ma describes the time and space<br>between sound and<br>silence achieving Oneness between the<br>two is an important part of shakuhachi<br>performance tension must be felt during<br>silences while sound produced must be<br>alive and creative the Zen Buddhism<br>believe that one should live in the<br>moment and the past and future are only<br>unre realistic constructions that exist<br>within our minds are also reflected in<br>shakuhachi plan similarly performing<br>towards the sea tension must be felt<br>during silences and as you can<br>see in this example taku even specifi<br>for the performers to rest for 3 seconds<br>music in summary through my research and<br>practical um research on the history<br>musical Aesthetics and performance<br>techniques of shakuhachi I have found<br>many um elements in this composition<br>that resembles the Japanese flu music<br>for example the use of Hol tones finger<br>tremolo and the importance of single<br>note and the Deep meaningful silences<br>through this research I help Hope aim to<br>help the performers to widen their<br>musical vocabulary and share some light<br>on the performance approach based on<br>true cultural awareness and appreciation<br>I also have help hope to help musicians<br>and audiences to go beyond the notes and<br>interpret contemporary fluk composition<br>from an expanded cultural perspective to<br>conclude this presentation Peter and I<br>would like to perform the first and<br>you<br>for<br>for<br>e<br>e<br>e<br>e<br>e<br>e</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
