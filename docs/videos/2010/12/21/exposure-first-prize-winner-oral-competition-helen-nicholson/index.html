the<br>department of management and<br>international business I have two our<br>wonderful supervisors Professor Brad<br>Jackson and Dr Bridget Carol so as I Was<br>preparing for this this presentation I<br>realized that it would be misleading of<br>me to craft my presentation in a way<br>that depicted my research as following a<br>linear Progressive stage of of<br>achievements rather um this word undoing<br>whilst it's relevant to my leadership<br>development participants is also<br>relevant to the way that I see and feel<br>research it can be a thoroughly undoing<br>process this word undoing is an<br>intricate one and it has at least three<br>layers of meanings so on the one hand<br>undoing means to open up to untie or<br>release it also means to discard or<br>reverse and at the more extreme end it<br>means bringing to ruination or to<br>destroy so as researchers we hope to<br>open up the mysteries of this world and<br>feel the thrill in unraveling those<br>ideas but at times we feel the loss of<br>having to let go our old our old<br>preconceptions and ideas and at times it<br>can bring us to our knees so whilst uh<br>my topic today speaks primarily about<br>participants in leadership development<br>programs I hope that some of you in the<br>room will be able to relate to it and<br>challenge it because undoing is an<br>integral part of being involved in<br>learning and Discovery in<br>universities so my presentation today<br>follows the feel more of an unfolding<br>story and My Story begins 2 and 1 half<br>years ago so 2 and a half years ago I<br>was doing a summer research project with<br>my soon to be um supervisor Bridget<br>Carrol and as part of this project I had<br>to read through screeds and screeds of<br>interview transcripts with people who<br>had been on leadership development<br>programs and I was astonished at the<br>amount of people who talked about<br>themselves in the transcripts there was<br>a lot of selft talk in them and I<br>started to think what is all this self<br>stuff for so I turned to the leadership<br>development literature and the hope that<br>they would explain to me what was going<br>on in leadership development programs<br>but I kept being confronted with this<br>assumption that organizations need to<br>develop their leadership it's necessary<br>for an effective<br>organization they didn't seem to be much<br>CR critical scrutiny about this<br>relationship between the South and<br>leadership<br>development<br>so<br>um the leadership development industry<br>is an interesting one in the sense that<br>it's estimated that approximately 50<br>billion US are spent globally around the<br>world in the pursuit of developing<br>leadership in this very in University we<br>have two institutes and centers<br>dedicated solely to the development of<br>leadership with many other initiatives<br>in the wings so it seemed bizarre to me<br>that there wasn't this critical<br>scrutiny especially given that<br>leadership development programs have<br>been positioned as identity workspaces<br>where um participants are encouraged to<br>work upon themselves often with their<br>organization footing the<br>bill at the same time there's<br>researchers like Scott saying that these<br>um these contexts in which identities<br>are reconstructed haven't been paid<br>enough attention to so my thesis<br>represents one attempt to try and halt<br>the surging tide and demand for<br>leadership development and instead ask<br>what is being done in the name of it so<br>I started my PhD research<br>with some guiding questions wanting to<br>look at why um identities were being<br>brought into leadership development what<br>is the consequence of doing identity<br>work in leadership<br>development before I move on to my uh<br>research I need to Define two words I've<br>used quite Loosely they're two very<br>contested terms so the first is this one<br>identity and I'm using it more from a<br>sociological perspective so what<br>identity means is is that pursuit to<br>answer that question who am I or who do<br>I want to become and it's often shifting<br>and for me it's linguistic and social in<br>nature so it's not just something<br>cognitive I'm not using the<br>psychological understanding of it<br>identity work is the term that captures<br>the Endeavors we engage in when trying<br>to answer that question so I've<br>highlighted these words because it shows<br>that how we understand identity work has<br>been framed in a particular way and in a<br>way that doesn't mention this idea of<br>undoing so those are the those are the<br>key terms I'm using<br>today so I started out um going to<br>Sweden actually to work with some of<br>these identity researchers and to be<br>raised in their particular research<br>methodology when it comes to Identity<br>studies so to to use some convoluted<br>academic terms um I'm following a social<br>constructionist Paradigm which is<br>perhaps different from what we've heard<br>so far today and essentially what this<br>means is that researchers following this<br>Paradigm believe that there is not one<br>objective reality out there that<br>research seeks to uncover rather the<br>research process is more interested in<br>how people come to understand their<br>world knowing that there are multiple<br>subjetive realities of which the<br>researcher has their own so we're<br>co-constructing<br>knowledge most importantly this Paradigm<br>pays an attention to language so how is<br>language used um in my context for IDE<br>identity and leadership development so<br>I've done what I call a hybrid<br>ethnography so ethnography is that term<br>for for days of old when researchers<br>used to put on a safari suit and carry<br>their notebook and go off to the<br>colonies and try to figure out what the<br>U the Savages were doing so I'm doing it<br>more in an organizational context it's<br>hybrid because on the one hand I'm doing<br>traditional forms I've observed people<br>face to face but it's virtual because<br>I've been observing these participants<br>in their online forum so I've covered<br>one leadership development program for<br>the last 18 months I've been observing<br>them and there's 36 participants from<br>across New Zealand from a diverse range<br>of<br>Industries to give you an idea of the<br>amount of data I've got I've got about<br>300 pages of field notes 500 pages of<br>their reflective journals and reflective<br>writing and 6,000 individual postings<br>have' made to these online forums so<br>it's profuse but the one of the things<br>that these Swedish research has taught<br>me is to try and look for breakdowns and<br>understanding so to try and look for<br>moments where you think that's just<br>bizarre so this Genesis of undoing comes<br>from the first residential funnily<br>enough where I was observing<br>participants and they were talking about<br>the nature of their leadership<br>development experience so far and one of<br>them said I feel like they've blown<br>everything to smiing I've been cut apart<br>that dissolved my foundations it's<br>shaken up everything I know<br>I say that it's bizarre because I really<br>hadn't expected them to talk in quite<br>destructive and violent terms in terms<br>of their identity so I started to trace<br>through my data these mentionings of<br>identity destruction but there was more<br>going on participants felt the thrill of<br>being opened up and learning more about<br>themselves some of them relished this<br>idea of Letting Go Old identities which<br>they felt had been holding them back and<br>others felt the loss of having to let go<br>those<br>so I scalled the leadership development<br>and identity literature wondering<br>perhaps has this undoing been done so<br>the leadership development literature<br>and the identity from org studies<br>literature tends to portray identity<br>work in a particular way and that is<br>that in our pursuit to understand<br>ourselves we add new identities or add<br>new aspects we build we construct and<br>once we get to that point we maintain<br>and protect protect who we are the<br>leadership development literature also<br>assumes that people progress from stages<br>of immaturity to<br>maturity whilst this work has<br>undoubtedly offered us some some real<br>advantages in this field of study I<br>started to Wonder Isn't there more to<br>Identity work and leadership development<br>than these movements particularly given<br>that this word develop has eological<br>roots in the word dveloper where death<br>means to undo and developer means to<br>wrap up so it seemed to me that<br>leadership development was looking more<br>at this wrapping up process and not the<br>undoing process which seems to be<br>implicit in the very word itself so my<br>thesis aims to temper this focus on<br>wrapping up and develop build this idea<br>of<br>undoing I then had to understand what<br>this undoing word means Shakespeare is<br>famous for using it in MC Beth What's<br>Done cannot be undone finally enough<br>that or studies literature is silent on<br>it we don't seem to talk about it in my<br>discipline so I traveled to various<br>Fields ending up looking at hippie<br>culture and special forces and this<br>crazy stuff and I realized that there's<br>about six different ways that undoing<br>can be<br>understood Coming Undone involves<br>moments where we feel unsettled opened<br>up or destroyed it also involves<br>stripping back aspects of who we are<br>even reversing who we are as Freud says<br>and then shedding aspects of<br>ourselves but it still didn't really hit<br>on what I was trying to accomplish in my<br>thesis until I found this one quote by<br>an American Scholar Judith Butler and<br>she she says we're undone by each other<br>and if we're not we're missing something<br>one does not always stay intact it may<br>be that one wants to or does but it may<br>also be that in despite One's best<br>efforts one is undone in the face of the<br>other by The Touch by the scent by the<br>feel by the prospect of the touch by the<br>memory of the feel Butler's quote is<br>important because she picks up on some<br>key themes in my research on the one<br>hand she sees undoing is this coming<br>apart of not staying intact she<br>references the undeniable relationality<br>involved in becoming undone we're undone<br>by each other it's not just a cognitive<br>internal private process she talks about<br>the different ways we can respond bond<br>to being undone we try to resist it<br>despite One's best efforts or we invite<br>being undone one wants to most<br>importantly though Butler says that if<br>we're not being undone we're missing a<br>fundamental part of human be of of being<br>a human if we're not we're missing<br>something so I propose that this quote<br>and this work of Butler although she's<br>talking about loss and sexuality cements<br>my topic as a vital area to understand<br>and greater depth for leadership<br>development literature so finally months<br>after doing my research my field workor<br>my data analysis I had my research<br>question following that more inductive<br>approach to<br>research I then had the the joyful task<br>of analyzing my thousands and thousands<br>of pieces of paper and in doing that I<br>was I was doing a technique called<br>discourse analysis where I'm looking at<br>the language participants use when they<br>talk about their identity and I'm also<br>looking at at how I how language is used<br>to undo them so things like questioning<br>or attacking or powerful language how<br>that can unravel you so I've come up<br>with six main what we call discourses<br>six different ways that undoing can<br>manifest in people some of these are<br>more energizing and the participants<br>really relished and delighted in the<br>opportunity to experience these so<br>participants talk of feeling loosened up<br>like they've been unfastened from a St<br>position they're able to move in more<br>ways than be than prior to the program<br>they talk about how they've been shaken<br>up and one of them uses the metaphor of<br>a glass um snow Dome so it's a gentle<br>agitating they feel has been done to<br>them they've been flipped upside down<br>but not in a violent way and they also<br>talk about letting go so one of them<br>relishes this idea of Letting Go her<br>engineer identity and adopting a new<br>leadership identity but there's also<br>some who really struggle with this they<br>feel the loss and wonder who are they<br>going to become when they give up this<br>engineer identity for<br>example there's also a set of discourses<br>that are more debilitating so I see<br>people on the program talk about being<br>cut apart being destroyed and the<br>problematic thing here is that it's the<br>facilitators who the participants give<br>the knife to do it to them they ask the<br>facilitators to cut them apart but then<br>feel um incredibly victimized when it<br>happened um this the second one slipping<br>back I've put an italics because it's<br>different to that undoing literature I<br>look at so I want to try and extend that<br>literature out slipping back refers to<br>how um in the pursuit of becoming a<br>different person we revert back to Old<br>identities and the problem here is that<br>participants castigate themselves<br>whenever they revert back so it becomes<br>quite a destructive um movement for them<br>and the last one is floundering so some<br>of them experience being shaken up and<br>then they just get lost they're not<br>quite sure how to make sense of it they<br>feel like they've lost who they are and<br>they're helpless so even when the<br>facilitators try to help them they still<br>don't know how to move forward so my<br>thesis looks at how are these created<br>who were involved in it and what are the<br>consequences so I'm entering into my<br>stage now of writing up my discussion<br>chapter and these are some of the<br>propositions and questions I'm holding<br>as I start to write the chapter I'd like<br>to position leadership development<br>programs of places of both identity<br>undoing and construction I don't think<br>we want leadership development programs<br>that do one or the other so coming back<br>to that definition of develop leadership<br>development programs wrap up and they<br>undo they settle and they shake they are<br>places some people escape to to deal<br>with their undoing that happens in their<br>organizational life but they're also<br>places people actively seek to become<br>undone because as Butler says they're<br>missing something so a question for<br>development becomes how do you move<br>between them how do you design programs<br>that can balance the tension of those<br>two I'm also wondering how can<br>leadership development programs<br>negotiate those debilitating forms of<br>undoing how can we how can we deal uh<br>with undoing so that it doesn't end in<br>self-destruction and finally though we<br>may be undone by each other I'm<br>uncomfortable with the amount of<br>participants who are placing that<br>responsibility in someone else's hands<br>and they're not taking upon the<br>responsibility to self undo or to<br>actively resist that<br>undoing so given that leadership<br>development seems as though it's here to<br>stay for at least the the the short<br>while I hope that my thesis shakes and<br>opens up how we understand leadership<br>development in a way that offers New<br>Alternatives in thinking thank thank<br>yeah that's a that's a common um<br>assumption that you're either born to be<br>a leader or you're not um operating from<br>a social constructionist Paradigm<br>assumes that nothing is fixed about your<br>identity so you're not born and<br>therefore you you have to stay within<br>that track for the rest of your life so<br>this leadership development program I<br>look at um they have a a large number of<br>academics working with them and they<br>also teach to a social constructionist<br>Paradigm so they believe that people can<br>certainly be developed As Leaders um and<br>that you can uh your your identity is<br>yeah yes gender<br>differences yeah yeah<br>that<br>iary<br>right yeah oh okay right gender<br>differences yes I've um I've been<br>schooled in gender Theory so it was an<br>active decision of mine to not look at<br>gender um why did I decide not to I felt<br>that there wasn't enough gender stuff<br>coming through um undoing seems to be<br>something that happens to both females<br>and M males<br>um in terms of even the destructive<br>forms there were certainly just as many<br>males saying that they felt um the the<br>pain of their character being um<br>destroyed as females were so I didn't<br>because I followed an inductive approach<br>which is to look at what the data is<br>saying and I didn't see much gender<br>stuff I decided to push that to the side<br>for my thesis but it's definitely on my<br>post PhD to-do list I think this<br>interesting stuff particularly given<br>female yes people running the program<br>yes yep yep so facilitators are they<br>both design the program and then they<br>run the residential workshops they<br>instigate a lot of this undoing um in<br>particular one facilitator and that's<br>another thing my my thesis looks at is<br>what are the implications of having one<br>per one facilitator shouldered with the<br>burden of having to undo people because<br>it's there's moments where she felt<br>that yes mentioned Very<br>onh<br>Yes of blind<br>is yes it's a very good question because<br>it's been one of my biggest challenges<br>to be honest I um and this talks to my<br>letting go I started my thesis thinking<br>we should demolish leadership<br>development and that it was symptomatic<br>of all the ills within our society so I<br>had a really strong framing of these<br>people are Engineers of the human soul<br>and there power dynamics and it's just<br>hideous but I guess as I've gone through<br>my my field work I've had to continually<br>test that assumption because I have seen<br>participants who have de developed in<br>really remarkable positive amazing ways<br>and they've been able to treat this<br>staff in in far better ways than they<br>did before and theyve opened up these<br>incredible opportunities for themselves<br>and negotiated their work life balance<br>in a far more um reasonable way so I'm<br>at the point now where I'm having to<br>write you know coming into my discussion<br>and I nearly I need to reframe all my<br>literature because I've written it with<br>that assumption that leadership<br>development programs are really<br>problematic and now I need to temper<br>that to look at um there is a place for<br>these and Society but that doesn't mean<br>we shouldn't critique them or challenge<br>them does that answer your<br>question I'm I'm my main concern with<br>leadership development programs is that<br>you're asking people to remove<br>themselves from the organizational<br>context learn a whole new language and<br>and way of doing leadership and then<br>inserting them back into that context<br>which is often quite bureaucratic and<br>doesn't allow for that translation and<br>that's been a really big struggle for<br>participants so we need to I'd love to<br>do a study with organizations where we<br>look at why are you sending people how<br>are you supporting them when they come<br>back<br>leadership<br>yes yeah it's a really interesting<br>question I think some who have struggled<br>the most are ones they're all they're<br>all University educated they're ones who<br>have been um taught in quite scientific<br>disciplines so the engineers and the<br>doctors and the scientists really<br>struggle with this social<br>constructionist approach that's asking<br>them to look at their identity and<br>experiment with who they are and most<br>importantly to let go of that expert<br>identity because for these people that's<br>how they've succeeded is by by becoming<br>a really brilliant surgeon or brilliant<br>engineer so to be asked to let some of<br>that go that's been you know that's<br>resulted in sort of floundering and<br>withdrawal from the program they just<br>said that's I can't I can't do<br>differences no sorry it was a it was a<br>new it's a New Zealand program um but my<br>training was in Sweden yeah so in Sweden<br>we have a university that's running a<br>concurrent a concurrent research program<br>so I'm going there in December and we'll<br>correlate some of our findings and see</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
