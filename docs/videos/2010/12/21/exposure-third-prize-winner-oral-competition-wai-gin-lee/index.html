many of these<br>people will progress on to end stage<br>liver failure or what we term as<br>therosis New Zealand has a high<br>prevalence of of um therosis<br>um due to the high rates of hepatitis B<br>and<br>C pictured here is aoic liver you'll see<br>that it has nodules and it just<br>basically looks<br>unhealthy sorosis results in about 420<br>deaths per<br>year the only viable cure at the moment<br>is liver<br>transplantation however because of as<br>you may be aware um New Zealand has a<br>difficulty and attaining Donal organs<br>and patients are having to wait on the<br>waiting list for longer and longer and<br>up to 15% of patients die on the waiting<br>list last year we were only able to<br>perform up to 40 transplants a year<br>looking at the difference between 40 and<br>420 we it is obvious that we have a long<br>way to go before we we reach um the<br>target of Performing as many transplants<br>as we can therefore there is a strong<br>need for any interventions that will<br>transplantation in a similar paper by<br>theica at all survival was shown to be<br>related to energy<br>expenditure however what in that study<br>the study was limited in the fact that<br>only viral stoic patients were examined<br>therefore our group chose to extend this<br>investigation and looked at all itic<br>patients what do we find in a large<br>cross-sectional study we found that 20%<br>of patients were hyper metabolic we<br>define hyper metabolism as the increase<br>of expected of um resting energy<br>predicted in agreement with the study by<br>theu at all we showed that elevated ing<br>energy expenditure was associated with a<br>PO<br>outcome if you look at this Captain<br>meire survival curve patients who were<br>hyper metabolic had about a third of the<br>survival of those who were normal<br>metabolic but more importantly what we<br>did find in that study was that even if<br>you looked at patients who were normal<br>metabolic so these were patients who had<br>normal resting energy expenditure and we<br>divided them up into quals<br>patients who had the highest<br>Cal had the worst<br>survival now this was a very significant<br>finding on our part because what it<br>meant was if we are able to reduce the<br>resting energy<br>expenditure we are able to benefit all<br>CTIC patients and not just patients who<br>metabolism in that same study we also<br>notice that patients who are on beta<br>blockers had about a third of the<br>prevalence of hyper<br>metabolism could it be that beta<br>metabolism going to the literature what<br>we do know is that short-term<br>intravenous infusion of be blockade does<br>reduce resting energy expenditure in<br>therosis in this paper by mu<br>adal where uh uh IV infusion was given<br>over 1 hour<br>a reduction in resting energy<br>expenditure was<br>seen also note that patients who are<br>hyper metabolic had a bigger decrease in<br>resling energy expenditure compared to<br>metabolic while we have data on<br>intravenous bet<br>blockade if we require data on oral bet<br>blockade that is only seen in pediatric<br>Burns patients in this study patients<br>who were treated with oral propenol over<br>a 2E period had a decrease in resting<br>energ energy expenditure compared to<br>treated oil V blockade or oil<br>medications are preferred to INF venous<br>medications because it is more tolerated<br>by the patients and also more<br>convenient so therefore to summarize the<br>points I've given so far firstly hyper<br>metabolism is common in<br>liosis increased resting engineer<br>expenditure is associated with a poorer<br>outcome stics on beta blockade are three<br>times less likely to be hyper<br>metabolic intravenous be blockade does<br>reduce resting energy expenditure in<br>sorosis but the only evidence in oral be<br>blockade at at this stage are in<br>patients with severe<br>burns these five key points led to the<br>hypothesis that o Bey blockade reduces<br>resting energy expenditure in adult<br>patients with liosis<br>in order to test this hypothesis the aim<br>of our study was to compare Nal against<br>Placebo for reduction of resting energy<br>expenditure using a double blind romise<br>crossover trial of patients with liver<br>curosis patients were recruited from the<br>hepatology or the liver clinics across<br>the greater Oakland region listed here<br>criteria clinically stable was defined<br>as<br>patients have not had a major<br>complication in the last month the other<br>inclusion criteria<br>are listed<br>there listed here are the exclusion<br>criteria we excluded patients with liver<br>cancer because it has been shown to<br>increase resting energy expenditure in<br>patients and so may have confounded our<br>results we also excluded patients were<br>listed for<br>transplantation because they are tend to<br>be unstable and may not have been able<br>trial sample size was calculated using<br>the absolute reduction of resting energy<br>expenditure from beta blockade that was<br>used shown in m at Al's<br>paper with that we calculated that we<br>would require about 10 patients per<br>group but we expected a nutrition rate<br>of about 20% mostly due to death and L<br>transplantation therefore the aim was to<br>recruit 12 patients per group<br>this is a schema of the study design<br>following ethics approval patients were<br>recruited and randomized to either<br>forber or<br>Nal they were treated for 3 months and<br>then crossed over and then there was a<br>wash out period of one month where they<br>were not taking any medications at all<br>and then cross over to Nal of PBO The<br>Other<br>Drug wrestling energy expenditure was<br>measured using the metabolic<br>cart an airtight Hood was placed over<br>the patient's head and air was drawn in<br>through the hood into the monitor oxygen<br>consumption and carbon dioxide<br>production was measured and with that we<br>were able to calculate the resting<br>energy expenditure patients were rested<br>for about half an hour prior to um<br>expenditure neol and Visually identical<br>Placebo was prepared by the hospital<br>pharmacy in Oakland and a randomization<br>was also performed by the<br>pharmacy Adverse Events were monitored<br>and the analysis was done on an<br>intention to treat<br>basis this is the consult diagram of the<br>progress progress of the patients<br>through the<br>trial 35 patients consecutively were<br>eligible for inclusion however nine<br>patients politely declined<br>two patients were asthmatics and one had<br>liver cancer and thus were<br>excluded 23 patients therefore entered<br>the<br>trial however one patient had to<br>commitments this table here shows that<br>both groups of patients were well<br>balanced I'll draw your attention to the<br>fact that we had a preponderance or<br>higher number of patients of hepatitis C<br>and B this was EXP expected due to the<br>rates we have in New<br>Zealand severity of therosis was graded<br>by child Pew grading you will note that<br>patients tended to be on the least<br>severe grading for this we only had one<br>hypermetabolic<br>patient what did we<br>find following treatment with three<br>months of of metalol patients had a<br>statistically significant decrease in<br>resting energy expenditure<br>those who Tre treated with Placebo did<br>not however when the groups were<br>compared the P value came to 0.07 and<br>was<br>borderline in terms of Adverse Events<br>there was no statistically significant<br>Adverse Events in the netol group one<br>patient in the group had to have netol<br>stopped due to severe headaches and<br>another patient had the dose reduced due<br>to low blood pressure<br>most of the other side effects were<br>related to mild Lethy or tiredness<br>although one patient had mild chest<br>tightness none of these required any<br>changes in the dosage of the<br>drug therefore in<br>conclusion oral beta blockade is well<br>tolerated by cerotic patients and in<br>this study we provide strong evidence<br>that oral beta blockade does reduce<br>resting energy<br>expenditure this finding has major imp<br>atients for prolonging survival in<br>cerotic<br>patients but it does need to be<br>confirmed by a definitive survival study<br>which are in planning thank<br>you are most serotic<br>patients not necessarily no um it<br>depends on the cause of the therosis um<br>therosis is where the liver fails and<br>there are many causes that can cause<br>that for example alcohol and um over<br>alcoholism tends to be in men rather<br>than women um whereas some other types<br>of um therosis caused by perhaps sort<br>autoimmune disorders where the body s<br>attacks itself um they tend to have more<br>women so it depends your study3 people<br>of which how many women um there were<br>about there were about five women so<br>yeah as far as we're aware no as far as<br>we're aware no um but the beauty of this<br>study was that because it was randomized<br>all right we try to take away any<br>potential Effects by chance um and also<br>um because it's a crossover study so the<br>patients had one medication and then<br>were crossover and had the other okay we<br>could compare the results with within<br>themselves and that gave a lot more<br>study I'm not sure I but um when you're<br>talking abouty metabolism normal what is<br>that in terms of like<br>any right so sorry I just try to get a<br>handle of your question so you're<br>wanting to know if the beta blockade<br>would have caused obesity in these<br>patients or might some of what is the<br>Hy<br>metabolic inic expend yeah they would<br>um I sort of prepared some other slides<br>we'll just um move forward to that it it<br>was a very busy table which I didn't<br>want to present here but I guess these<br>These are the um chloric um the resing<br>energy expenditure of the patients okay<br>at the beginning and end of each 3 month<br>period so I guess that sort of answers<br>your question but I mean the<br>significance of hyper metabolism is that<br>and and that was um where I started my<br>survival</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
