accurate.</p><p>and from of and health<br>science<br>presentation thank you very much um my<br>name is Andrew Wood I'm a doctor at<br>ockland hospital um in specialist<br>training in ear nose and throat surgery<br>um but I've chosen to take some time out<br>from my Hospital training to undertake a<br>PhD split between the department of<br>surgery and the department of Mo<br>medicine under the supervision of John<br>Fraser and Richard<br>Douglas now as um inos and throat<br>surgeons we get fairly used to looking<br>in the various holes of the head with um<br>microscopes and fancy cameras and all<br>sorts but I'm sure you haven't so this<br>is a little bit of video just to<br>orientate you this is the inside of the<br>left side of a patient's nose with<br>sinusitis little suction tube in there<br>and all sorts of gooey horrible looking<br>snotty stuff coming out of the<br>sinuses so I apologize ladies and<br>go so snotty noses so what I mean surely<br>there's more important things to look at<br>well as Richard and I have recently<br>reviewed the literature shows us that<br>chronic sinus disease is actually<br>extremely common and potentially one of<br>if or if not the most prevalent chronic<br>disorder in Western societies with<br>reported uh data suggesting a prevalence<br>population the main issue really there<br>however is that our patients are<br>miserable um they come to our Clinic<br>really frustrated with life and some of<br>them are actually reasonbly apologetic<br>they assume that they're just<br>complaining but it seems to be quite a<br>reproducible finding that patients are<br>extremely unhappy and there's some<br>reliable quality of life data in the<br>the disease is characterized by<br>inflammation essentially in the sinuses<br>and unfortunately despite the best<br>medical and surgical treatment that we<br>can offer unfortunately it's intractable<br>so it's a really significant health<br>problem and to try and summarize in two<br>words really there's been an awful lot<br>of work to try and understand what's<br>going on and why but I think it's<br>reasonably fair to say that the cause is<br>essentially unknown at the moment now<br>the disorder is divided up on the basis<br>of whether these things which are nasal<br>polyps are present inside the nose or<br>not and you can see this big swollen<br>poet it's blocking the entire nostril<br>the lining of the nose is all inflamed<br>there gooey mu mucus patient can't<br>breathe through their nose can't smell<br>and if you imagine that you got this you<br>basically feel like you've got a nasty<br>cold every single day of the year and<br>it's it's pretty<br>unpleasant all of our patients get a CT<br>scan this is a picture essentially<br>imagining a slice taken through the head<br>and CT shows bone to be white Air to be<br>black and everything else in between to<br>be gray so you can see the brain at the<br>top these are the eyes on either side<br>sinuses and then just catch the upper<br>teeth at the bottom so this is a scan<br>from a patient with essentially healthy<br>nose and sinuses and you can see<br>beautiful fresh air flowing through<br>their nose and all looks well you<br>compare that to a CT scan from one of<br>our patients and you can see that their<br>nose and sinuses are full of inflame<br>unpleasant now my my particular interest<br>in this disorder is focused around the<br>microbiology or the bugs that could be<br>underpinning the disorder and the<br>history of the microbiology of this<br>condition is dominated by this thing<br>which some of you will recognize is a<br>conventional bacterial culture swab<br>that's used everywhere in the hospital<br>and there's um a number of Publications<br>in the literature one of which I've<br>cited where people have come along found<br>a group of patients with sinusitis poked<br>these things inside their nose taken a<br>bit of a sample some sample from some<br>normal individuals and compare the two<br>and when you do that it's pretty clear<br>that the bacteria that exist in the<br>mucus in sintis and in everyone else's<br>noses is is really pretty similar and so<br>it's LED authors such as this one to a<br>conclude well if you can't find any<br>difference in the bacteria and the mucus<br>relevant however in the last few years<br>there have been two isolated<br>Publications describing the presence of<br>bacteria actually hidden away inside the<br>tissue itself so out of the reach of<br>where this culture swab is going now<br>both of the Articles um only<br>specifically look for one particular<br>type of bacteria called staff<br>orus neither of the Articles have looked<br>for other types of bacteria and whether<br>they exist and unfortunately neither of<br>the Articles have really given us much<br>insight as to what those bacteria might<br>there so the first objective of my<br>research in this particular study is to<br>try to identify all of the bacteria that<br>are present within the tissue itself in<br>in sinus disease um and not just staff<br>orus like these two other<br>studies to determine what the species of<br>these bacteria might<br>be and thirdly to correlate the presence<br>of bacteria to the presence of the<br>inflammatory cells that characterize the<br>disorder now we're all taught at Medical<br>School the standard Dogma which is that<br>bacteria are bad and inflammatory<br>inflammatory cells will rush to bacteria<br>are and chew them up and it's all very<br>straightforward but it's just starting<br>to become acknowledged in the literature<br>also with some work from John Fraser's<br>lab shown that actually the bugs might<br>not be just innocent bystanders in this<br>whole process and it may be that the<br>bugs are slightly more canny than we<br>for so during sinus surgery in the<br>treatment of this disorder we routinely<br>pull out large amounts of tissue out of<br>the nose as you can see here to open up<br>up the sinuses and make them look nice<br>and healthy so with eth ethical approval<br>it really wasn't a difficult job to<br>collect lots of tissue samples from<br>patients with sinus disease<br>unfortunately it's not quite so easy to<br>find some normal individuals who are<br>willing to provide samples from inside<br>their nose and sinuses to um collect but<br>luckily God had the good sense to give<br>the brain a fairly privileged position<br>right next to the sinuses and so there's<br>a small number of brain tumors like this<br>one here that are best approached by<br>going through the nose and out the back<br>of the sinuses to scoop out the little<br>tumor like you can see coming out and so<br>in these patients I come rushing along<br>comparism I've tried to summarize My<br>Method as uh simply as possible really<br>and these tissue samples what I do is I<br>cut them into very fine sections and to<br>mount them up onto little glass<br>microscopy slides so on my first slide<br>I'll put five separate bits of<br>tissue and I'll process this with a<br>technique that it's known as<br>imunohistochemistry so essentially it's<br>a technique that's designed to recognize<br>different cell types based on the<br>molecules that are present on their<br>surface and so I've got little I've got<br>antibodies that recognize these little<br>markers that Define the different cell<br>types for<br>me what I then do is I put another stain<br>onto all these sections called gmza<br>which stains bacteria a blue black color<br>so all of these slides I can recognize<br>where the bacteria are and I can<br>recognize where the inflammatory cells<br>are<br>this is a section of mucosa that I've<br>processed um this is infect stained with<br>saffrin which is a a red stain as you<br>can see but this just gives you an idea<br>of roughly what we're looking at so on<br>the surface of these tissue you have a<br>barrier cell layer called epithelial<br>cells and they've got tiny little hair<br>that sit on the surface that keeps the<br>surface clean called<br>cyia now I've represented that in a<br>schematic fashion here just to try and<br>illustrate things and so wherever I see<br>clust of bacteria that are existing in<br>the tissue then I focus my microscope on<br>those that cluster of bacteria and count<br>the inflammatory cells all the way<br>around in that microscope<br>field I'll then randomly select areas<br>from the same bits of tissue where there<br>are no bacteria present and do exactly<br>the same thing and count the number of<br>inflammatory cells there so it can be<br>directly compared areas where there are<br>bacteria as you saw there's a second<br>microscope slide that I prepare as well<br>and again I put five little thin tissue<br>sections onto that slide too now this<br>slide gets processed separately this<br>goes and I perform a technique called<br>fluoresence Inu hybridization which<br>essentially provides the ability to<br>recognize different species of bacteria<br>based on their genetic makeup and the<br>probes that you use have little<br>fluorescent tags so it can make the<br>bacteria glow nicely and you can work<br>out what's what and where they<br>are I use um one probe which is called a<br>u bacterial probe so in other words Iden<br>if Ying all bacteria or EU as you can<br>see on here and then probes specifically<br>designed to recognize staff orus like<br>everyone else has but also to look for<br>strep pneumonia and hemophilus influenza<br>which are two other common bacteria seen<br>sinuses in all good science you need<br>some controls to just make sure that<br>your techniques are working in the way<br>that they should<br>be so I use sections of human spleen<br>which as some of you will know a Jam<br>full of human inflammatory cells and<br>then process in exactly the same fashion<br>and you can see here this is my antibody<br>that demonstrates B lymphocytes one of<br>the types of inflammatory cells and it<br>works nicely to to show where they<br>are for the bacterial work what I've<br>done is I get little piece of lamped<br>liver put them into a pure broth culture<br>of bacteria so they get infiltrated with<br>different species of bacteria and then<br>again I process them in the same fashion<br>so this is a fluorescence insitu<br>hybridization picture so the sort of the<br>the brown green background is is the<br>liver tissue and then you can see the<br>shower of bright green dots which is the<br>staff orus that's been identified by my<br>fluorescent<br>prob so in terms of the results with the<br>sinus<br>tissue as a lot of you will know<br>bacteria are divided in general terms<br>into two broad groups so bacteria that<br>are spherical shaped or cocky and<br>bacteria that are Rod shaped or<br>basili it was immediately obvious that<br>there were actually quite large numbers<br>of cocky present within the tissue and<br>you can again see a cluster of bright<br>green dots the bacteria that's present<br>in the<br>tissue this is a gems are stained<br>picture as I described and this shows a<br>tissue looking at the particular species<br>there was some staff orus<br>present and I've also found some<br>homophilous present in the tissue as<br>well so sort of trying to put all that<br>together into a table form so it's a bit<br>more understandable the Striking finding<br>really is that in the two subtypes of<br>chronic sinusitis those with and without<br>nasal polyps the presence of these<br>little clusters of bacteria in the<br>tissue really is extremely prevalent so<br>in those without nasal polyps we saw it<br>in four out of five in those with nasal<br>polyps it was in six out of<br>seven when the normals were analyzed and<br>these were all processed in a blinded<br>fashion so I didn't see whether they had<br>sintis or not as I was analyzing them<br>there was only one colony found on one<br>indeed it does seem that the dominant<br>bacterial species is storus but there<br>seen but what's really excited us the<br>most is these clusters of bacteria that<br>are present in the tissue as you can see<br>here with the blue gemza<br>stain look extremely<br>happy as I've said standard microbiology<br>Dogma is that the human immune cell<br>should be rushing to where these are and<br>chewing through them and and having them<br>for breakfast<br>ready these little brown cells are are<br>macres so they're one of the immune<br>cells that are particularly proficient<br>or so we're taught particularly<br>proficient at chewing up bacteria and<br>yes they're in the tissue but they're<br>certainly not rushing around and<br>destroying this colony of bacteria in<br>expected when the all the numbers got<br>processed and put together the story<br>actually got more interesting in that<br>what I've shown here is the average<br>number of um these are T lymphocytes one<br>of the inflammatory cells that are<br>around these little cluster of bacteria<br>and when you compare it to the counts<br>from the same tissue samples but<br>elsewhere there is actually in fact less<br>T lymphocytes around these clusters of<br>bacteria so they're completely opposite<br>phenomenon from what standard Dogma<br>teaches<br>us in the same way there's less numbers<br>of B<br>cells and less numbers of eosinophils<br>and those three particular cell types<br>all reach the um test for statistical<br>applied so in<br>conclusion well the first thing to say<br>is that strikingly bacteria within the<br>mucosa or within the tissue seems to be<br>extremely prevalent in this<br>disorder I found colonies of bacteria in<br>10 out of my 12 sinusitis samples and<br>only one out of five of the normals<br>potentially suggesting that these could<br>disorder staff glus indeed see indeed<br>seems to be the dominant organism but<br>certainly not the only organism present<br>in the<br>tissue but what's really fascinated us<br>the most is this apparent ability of the<br>clusters of bacteria to somehow paralyze<br>the immune response and hold the human<br>inflammatory cells away so that they can<br>reproduce happily and this really is<br>what's going to direct the second half<br>of my<br>thesis I'd like to acknowledge the help<br>of an awful lot of people who have<br>supported me many of whom are here this<br>evening um and the garet past Rodney<br>Williams Memorial Foundation who founded<br>questions yes so is it possible that you<br>have a lot of IM cells there but they're<br>not<br>bad<br>so<br>um the um I guess the challenge is if<br>these things really are at the center of<br>it all is to work out how to get rid of<br>them and that's that's the the the<br>clinical context to make this really<br>worthwhile is to um be able to clear<br>them and if we can find a suitable way<br>to treat these patients and get rid of<br>them then we can start to discover in<br>screening um so there are finally in<br>2007 some agreed published guidelines<br>came out as to who has sinusitis and who<br>didn't before 2007 the published<br>literature was all just well I took a<br>group of people that I thought had<br>sinusitis so now there are um agreed<br>criteria which is basically you have to<br>have symptoms for 12 weeks at least um<br>and there are different criteria about<br>whether your nose is blocked and runny<br>and all these other things to to have<br>the have the<br>diagnosis um I lost the second half of<br>your question no<br>indic no so<br>um the the clinical experience that we<br>have the literature that's out there<br>shows that these are normal happy<br>healthy people who are walking around<br>enjoying life and something happens in<br>usually in their 20s or 30s and suddenly<br>they're struck with this disorder and<br>all the tests show that elsewhere in the<br>body the immune system is entirely<br>healthy but somehow there seems to be<br>this local immune dysfunction that seems<br>sinuses hasis been described elsewhere<br>what<br>are um I think it's fair to say that<br>this is not a complete surprise to us in<br>that there is some inv vitro data about<br>as I mentioned being about what how<br>bacteria can produce proteins that seem<br>to be um disrupting normal host immunity<br>um but actually in Vivo in in tissue<br>samples taken from from Human subjects<br>no it's it's not been described I mean I<br>don't think anyone has actually used<br>this sort of method to really go and<br>look for it so you know whether this is<br>applicable to other diseases as well<br>quite possibly um in terms of why as<br>I've mentioned there is there is inv<br>vitro data about different proteins that<br>bacteria can<br>elute um that we do know can disrupt<br>different um inflammatory cells so<br>that's they're the proteins that we're<br>youris<br>Rel<br>um a lot of people have gone looking for<br>a<br>single event or a single factor to blame<br>in this disorder and and nobody's found<br>it and I think there's increasing<br>understanding that it's it's a what we<br>call a multifactorial disorder so<br>there's a number of different things<br>that come together at the same time um<br>and as I hinted at a moment ago the<br>literature is now turning towards the<br>fact that it's not necessarily quite as<br>simple as just inflammation in the way<br>that we always assume lots of<br>inflammatory cells come bad things<br>happen but that potentially there's some<br>sort of immune dysfunction that happens<br>at a local level in the nose and sinuses<br>and I think that's probably where this<br>comes in is that it could be could well<br>be that these custers of bacteria are<br>somehow disrupting the normal immune<br>response and then there's a second<br>factor that is involved I I can't give<br>you a nice neat hypothesis whereby we<br>can blame everything on these but I<br>your<br>um one of the questions in my mind is is<br>where these are coming from now<br>there is recent evidence in the last few<br>years that um structures called biofilms<br>are sitting on the surface of the mucos<br>are in this condition and one of my<br>other studies is is looking more at the<br>presence and role of<br>biofilms one might intuitively think<br>that if there's bacteria that's stuck<br>onto the surface that they're the ones<br>that are invading into the tissue and<br>causing the bother now we haven't shown<br>that but that that's that's an<br>assumption that could be made now if<br>that truly is the case and it would be<br>nice to try and demonstrate whether that<br>is the case then potentially treatments<br>that will disrupt the biofilm from the<br>surface in combination with antibiotics<br>coming through the bloodstream may do</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
