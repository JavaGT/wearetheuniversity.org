achievement<br>data and during this presentation I'm<br>going to outline my research<br>questions um my methodology my finding<br>contributions and also the next steps<br>research now the aim of this study was<br>to do something useful with what is<br>becoming an increasingly large<br>collection of achievement data that we<br>collect about students at school and I<br>wanted to do something that was positive<br>that was something that was formative<br>something that raised expectations and<br>also raised achievement typically a lot<br>of data achievement data is collected<br>about students after they've done their<br>examinations and we look back I wanted<br>to do something that would allow us to<br>do something before it was too late so<br>what I did was I looked at patterns of<br>achievement and used those patterns and<br>Trends in the data to design um a system<br>students my study was Guided by three<br>research questions to what extent does<br>the development of individual academic<br>Target targets impact on student<br>achievement does the development of<br>those targets affect different subgroups<br>of students in the school differently<br>and what were the teachers expectations<br>of having targets for<br>students obviously when you do a study<br>books interestingly enough there is not<br>a lot of research about Target setting<br>per se but there's a lot of research<br>about goal setting now if you look in<br>the dictionary for the definition of<br>Target and goal they are the same and I<br>made an assumption that they were the<br>same now in the literature of which<br>there's a large amount of literature<br>being collected on the effects on<br>performance of having goals um<br>predominantly carried out by lock and<br>laam over the last 40 years for findings<br>that are particularly interesting the<br>more difficult the goal is the more<br>effort will a person will put into<br>achieving that goal provided within<br>their limits of being able to do it<br>specific goals are much more effective<br>than just do your best um and goals<br>Focus attention on the activity in<br>question and they improve<br>motivation the other literature that I<br>looked at were teacher expectations and<br>these two bullet points really kind of<br>identify a bit of a a kind of mismatch<br>one from Temple and Phillips found that<br>teacher expectations became the goals<br>for<br>students but in New Zealand research is<br>saying that we're actually as teachers<br>not that good we don't have perhaps the<br>highest expectations we could have for<br>some students so that is an interesting<br>problem the other research that I dipped<br>into was looking at feedback obviously<br>if you have a goal as feedback um is<br>very important in terms of monitoring<br>your process progress towards a goal and<br>to make sure you can change your<br>strategy or whatever you're doing to<br>make sure you reach that goal and hati<br>found that feedback was an important<br>correlate of student achievement<br>my methodology basically I used a mixed<br>methods uh predominantly quantitative<br>looking at um data and Trends in the<br>data and qualitative a small qualitative<br>study to look at the teacher effects on<br>um the experiences of the target<br>setting my participants were year n and<br>year 11 students from a large secondary<br>school about 500 students in each of<br>those year groups but I had comparative<br>data from five previous cohorts of<br>students to compare with and from nearby<br>secondary schools as well and for the<br>qualitative study uh selection of staff<br>from the<br>school now I wanted to be my goals for<br>students are to determine the targets<br>for students in real life assessments<br>not something that was made up<br>specifically for this study it had to be<br>real so the um the data that I Ed were<br>in um<br>data collected from midus which is<br>Middle years information system it's a<br>bit like an intelligence test students<br>um take a test to see um vocabulary math<br>skills but very kind of generic then<br>obviously the national certificates in<br>year 11 the targets were expressed in<br>terms of that and I also used<br>Asel which is an assessment tool for<br>teaching and<br>learning to to have a manageable thesis<br>really I had to break down my work in<br>into two studies a quantitative study<br>which was further divided into three<br>parts and the qualitative<br>study study one was in three parts<br>because of the nature of the targets I<br>had to develop the first Target study<br>was to do with gaining NCA level one or<br>not so the students were given a Target<br>that they would or in the current year<br>they would not gain level one the second<br>lot of targets looked at gaining<br>achieved Merit or excellence in the<br>English and maths external standards at<br>level one and the third type of Target<br>that I examined was gaining an astral<br>sublevel now the astral scores are<br>levels the method that I use to develop<br>my targets is based on something that's<br>used in business it's called data and<br>development analysis and basically this<br>model looks at rather than looking at<br>the average achievement it looks at the<br>outer envelope of achievement and the<br>next few slides demonstrate how this<br>works so in my study I looked at the<br>achievement of of um students in year 9<br>and on the horizontal axis these are the<br>the marks that you can get in the astal<br>assessment that students took at the<br>beginning of year 9 and then the<br>vertical axis looks at the scores on um<br>the end of year 9 test and each star<br>represents a student now you can see<br>that the tests are highly correlated<br>they um form a definite<br>packed now normally what happens with a<br>lot of modeling is we we put a<br>regression model now the regression<br>model looks at average<br>achievement so this is kind of a best<br>fit regression model and you can see<br>that if I was using this as a Target<br>setting method for these students here<br>the whole emphasis the whole design of<br>my target setting program was that if<br>you look at students who come in with a<br>score of 600 and then in previous data<br>they get a range of scores so some do<br>really well some don't do so well but if<br>we can have a methodology that or a way<br>of actually having an aspirational<br>Target based on what is happening and<br>using data development analysis what you<br>can see here is that I plotted Ed the<br>Target on the extreme boundary so if a<br>student came in with a 600 score then I<br>didn't see why there wasn't a reason why<br>an a Target would be 800 would be<br>reasonable if one person in that group<br>can get a score of 600 why can't<br>everybody that comes into the school get<br>a um com in with 600 get a score of 800<br>so the aspirational targets with an<br>the findings from my<br>study in terms of question one to what<br>extent does the development of IND<br>individual student academic targets<br>impact on student achievement there was<br>from the first study at looking at NC<br>level one um students in the<br>intervention were twice as likely to<br>gain level one than students who had not<br>been in the intervention on average<br>those students gained 99 credits before<br>uh during the intervention whereas<br>previously they'd only gained 89 or the<br>control group had gained<br>89 from study 1B looking at individual<br>Targets in English and math external<br>standards again students who came to the<br>school on average um prior to the<br>invention of getting an achieved<br>achieved achieved and Merit grades in<br>four of the<br>standards they resulted after the<br>invention of on average of coming out<br>with achieved and three merits in the<br>standards So Not only was the number of<br>credits improved but also so the quality<br>of the actual<br>standards in the third study that<br>involved 9 students um students improved<br>their performance according um compared<br>to the previous year n and also to<br>current uh students in year 9 at the<br>local schools in maths they did not<br>perform um better than those students<br>from the previous year but they did<br>perform better than the students from<br>schools my search question two the<br>findings that looked at the differences<br>in having targets for the different<br>subgroups there was some evidence to<br>show that they narrowed the gaps between<br>genders so boys did seem to improve<br>somewhat by having targets and being<br>talked to them about achieving a Target<br>and there was a significant reduction in<br>the gap between New Zealand European<br>students and Pacifica students but that<br>was not the case for Mari<br>students in the other two studies there<br>was no real evidence that there was a<br>difference poal effect or no Gap closing<br>gender my research question three which<br>looked at teachers experiences of Target<br>setting teachers said that they really<br>enjoyed talking to their students about<br>targets and having a conversation and<br>improved their relationships with the<br>student but they still had varying<br>degrees of support for the intervention<br>some liked it some f thought that U<br>relying on data they didn't like that<br>they preferred their own um<br>expectations and this particularly arose<br>when the teachers expectations<br>contradicted the information from the<br>target setting in intervention so for<br>example if um the data from from my work<br>said that the student should be aiming<br>for um an Excellence grade in one of the<br>standards and the student the teacher<br>thought they were only going to gain and<br>Achieve there was a little bit of<br>tension there they didn't believe me<br>Viewpoint so there are four themes that<br>emerged from my studies basically that<br>having goals um was useful and this way<br>of generating them did raise student<br>achievement although not explicit in my<br>study um having effective data<br>management structures that manage and<br>how you collect data and keeping it over<br>Target setting worked really well in the<br>in NCA a standards based assessment and<br>this is<br>because um the literature says that if a<br>Target is explicit or well defined it's<br>much easier to attain and some of the<br>standards most of the standards in NCA<br>the point of Standards based assessment<br>is that these are clearly defined what<br>the skills and level the students have<br>to do it's much harder to go for a<br>target of 50% when you don't know what<br>the skills are that you have to have to<br>50% teachers experiences of Target<br>setting um the Deans who were the voice<br>of the targets if you like so the<br>students came to see the Deans to talk<br>about their progress um they really<br>enjoyed their the new aspect of their<br>role instead of talking to students<br>about having the wrong socks on or being<br>naughty they could actually talk to them<br>about something positive about how they<br>were going to achieve and to monitor<br>their progress there was a difference in<br>response between the English and math<br>teachers English teachers got on board<br>and were really behind the project the<br>Math teachers were a little bit more<br>skeptical of using<br>data um which is<br>interesting um although as I said<br>earlier there was an improved<br>relationship between a student and<br>teacher not a single teacher reported<br>changing their practice to try and and<br>Achieve or to change to gain the targets<br>they saw it more as something that was<br>domain uh in my contribution I feel that<br>I have um looked at data rather than<br>focus on past I've looked at formative<br>use of a DAT of data I've tried to<br>tackle um a way of coming up with high<br>expectations for students in the form of<br>targets and I've contri contributed to<br>the<br>literature the next steps and further<br>studies well this process has been<br>trialed already in um about 10 schools<br>so they're looking at collecting data<br>and developing Target setting I'd like<br>to explore more the tension in the<br>detail between students expectations and<br>Stu uh the teachers expectations of<br>students rather and those expectations<br>generated by the Target setting process<br>and I'd like to um to talk to students<br>more and see what their opinions were of<br>the target setting<br>process um and that's it thank you very<br>questions I was curious how your um how<br>you implement like did the students<br>volunteer or was it like an after school<br>thing was it in the classroom um what<br>happened was it was um it was something<br>that was agreed with with the principal<br>and all students took part in the<br>project and what it is is I I in my<br>study I developed all the um kind of the<br>statistical analysis and the targets but<br>I wasn't allowed to talk to the students<br>so the um the school as part of an<br>academic counseling program had Deans<br>talked to students in more generic sense<br>and and targets to do with level one um<br>and the subject teachers were involved<br>in terms of the English and math targets<br>so they talk to the students about<br>yeah a little<br>abouts were conveyed to<br>influence um the way it was conveyed to<br>the students was as I said through the<br>Deans so they had a more academic role<br>and um the way that they conveyed it was<br>um in a sensitive manner obviously you<br>don't go to a student and say right<br>you're going to fail level won this year<br>according to this target um I don't<br>think that's appropriate so obviously<br>they discussed um they knew the<br>information and they'd start off the<br>conversation with the student by saying<br>well what do you want to achieve by the<br>end of the year and the students would<br>either say yes I want level one or you<br>know or whatever the conversation went<br>and the the the staff would um say well<br>you know where expecting from the<br>information about you so far that you<br>will definitely um achieve level one<br>this year or you know how it might take<br>a little bit longer that sort of thing<br>so it was it was um always tackled as a<br>positive not a you're going to fail and<br>off you go thing it was we had to manage<br>carefully<br>yeah school newal and<br>of<br>teacher<br>student why Haven you<br>go um they academic counseling and<br>Target setting program does involve<br>parents but was not part of my<br>PhD um so the parents are involved in<br>some of the<br>conversations um to do with um certainly<br>monitoring and and U looking at the<br>students aspirations that tends to come<br>from the academic counseling um part of<br>the program not from the work from my<br>se you give me an example of<br>um yes for example it would be um<br>oneid um I guess it's because of the<br>nature of the qualification so that was<br>one target that was the first study I<br>looked at and the second target was for<br>example in the standard of algebra and<br>math level one the target would be<br>achieving EXC U achieving the standard<br>with Excellence what's different<br>then what if teer would always say we<br>like get level one parents would<br>say was there anything more than just<br>saying we want you<br>pass um yeah I think it was related to<br>it was it was more in depth because it<br>was related to the actual achievement<br>and having those aspirational goals for<br>the student meant that we could track<br>really carefully how they were working<br>towards the in the school initially<br>there uh for example there was 55% who<br>gained level one so obvious obviously it<br>would have been inappropriate to have a<br>target of gaining 100% because targets<br>they need to be realistic so we looked<br>at the achievement patterns of our<br>students according to certain criteria<br>and then we<br>identified um a number of students that<br>we thought with an element of challenge<br>so we were really looking at pushing up<br>and ident pushing up the percentage of<br>students that gained level one and<br>identifying those students where we<br>could do that don't understand what are<br>you putting in front of the children the<br>kids to<br>passing uh from my particular study it's<br>more systems aligned obviously the in I<br>don't I don't teach the sub I don't<br>change what's happening in the classroom<br>other than providing information which<br>is a challenge a realistic achievable<br>challenge for students to gain and<br>um not not according to the study<br>obviously gaining the certificate but in<br>the school itself there was a lot more<br>discussion about you know gaining the<br>literacy aspect of level one gaining the<br>numeracy getting the credits I know many<br>form teachers they celebrated with the<br>students when they gained um because you<br>can gain level one as you progress<br>through the year and it's not all<br>doesn't all hang on the end of the year<br>exam so the many form teachers could<br>celebrate with the students about their<br>um the gaining of the certificate what<br>was asking was there was<br>join um no there was no um there was no<br>um Target group per se all students in<br>the year were yeah<br>yeah well the whole process of talking<br>about students achievement um the<br>literature suggests that if you talk<br>about students achievement in terms of a<br>long-term goal like becoming a doctor or<br>something like that it it works if we<br>can talk to students about those things<br>look at their achievement and encourage<br>them um to to get that long-term goal<br>successful<br>students students aware of<br>the um yes it was part of the the school<br>they knew that an academic counseling uh<br>project was being um introduced into the<br>school and they were aware of they were<br>part of that so they were told like ACC<br>to be a to do this<br>well yeah as I said in in a a sensitive<br>kind<br>yes num should yeah that that kind of</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
