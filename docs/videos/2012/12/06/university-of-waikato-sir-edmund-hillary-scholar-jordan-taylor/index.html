for the good<br>management school they have i wanted to<br>pursue accounting studies<br>so i came here back in 2008<br>and i was selected on the hillary<br>scholarship for my<br>endeavors in athletics so it's been an<br>amazing experience being on the<br>scholarship with the opportunities<br>that have arisen out of that and the<br>support that it's given me to be able to<br>maintain<br>competitive sport while still doing well<br>in my studies<br>well i finished my studies november last<br>year<br>and missed actually missed graduation<br>which is<br>may this year and because i was overseas<br>in hawaii of all places i was at the<br>university of the nations<br>which is a christian missionary<br>university<br>and i was doing a school that involved<br>three months of lectures<br>about how to be a missionary and i guess<br>how to practice what you preach as a<br>christian<br>and then going out to a foreign country<br>to put into practice and i went to india<br>so it was a an amazing opportunity to<br>start<br>putting i guess the values that i really<br>learned partly through the<br>hillary scholarship program and also<br>through my my christian beliefs<br>i guess what it really boils down to and<br>we see it with<br>serem and hillary is just the pursuit of<br>excellence in all areas of your life<br>that not to compartmentalise striving in<br>just sport or striving in just<br>academics but really that it's it all<br>forms<br>who you are all these different areas of<br>your life<br>and excellence and serving<br>i guess is the two values that i see<br>under gerds the hillary scholarship<br>i guess when i finished university i was<br>actually going to<br>further my studies and do my masters at<br>oxford through the rhodes scholarship<br>and i got through to the final stage of<br>that application process<br>and i was down in wellington and had a<br>disappointing result didn't actually get<br>the scholarship<br>but what that did was it kind of ruined<br>me for the ordinary i thought<br>if i almost got the scholarship to do<br>study at oxford<br>what can i do with my life what what<br>more is there that i can do<br>rather than accept this accounting job<br>which i'd already been offered and i<br>thought<br>the accounting job's always going to be<br>there i think i'd always be able to get<br>into that industry if i wanted to<br>i'm young let's try and see what i'm<br>truly passionate about<br>i enjoy accounting and i'm good at<br>accounting<br>i want to find something i was really<br>passionate about and actually make a<br>difference<br>so yeah i went to india and i just saw<br>things that<br>you don't you can't really get through a<br>picture or even through a video or a<br>movie<br>poor people in a slum and you they just<br>are so generous and they bring out their<br>best for you<br>when they have nothing it seems like the<br>more<br>poor they are the less they have the<br>more generous they are it's such<br>a such the flip side of what i see in<br>the western world sometimes<br>and just the impact even on myself that<br>i had from this time not just the impact<br>i got to have on others by<br>giving up my time and giving up my<br>resources was<br>was phenomenal and it really has changed<br>the way i view my life and view what<br>what i'm supposed to do while i'm on<br>earth<br>and the difference that i can make it<br>literally made a massive difference in<br>nepal<br>and even monuments to hillary in the<br>villages<br>in nepal the people in that area almost<br>worship him<br>just a person that really contributed to<br>the communities there and<br>the first person to climb everest an<br>amazing feat that i guess<br>would seem overwhelming seem impossible<br>but you know how do you climb everest<br>one step at a time how do you prepare<br>for it you do<br>you know one mountain climb at a time<br>and i guess that's<br>that's what i was doing in india it's an<br>overwhelming mountain<br>a summit that seems unconquerable but<br>i can offer what i've got and try and<br>make a difference in the place<br>i have a long-term goal that's really<br>pretty general<br>as i know that all these things i'm<br>doing with my life is<br>shaping who i become and i want to be in<br>a role that<br>is leading people so whether that is in<br>the business world<br>being a ceo of an organization and being<br>able to<br>have an organization that really<br>reflects what i believe honesty<br>integrity excellence or whether it's<br>being a volunteer<br>in a missionary organization so i know<br>that i want to be in a leadership<br>position<br>i know i want to be lifting people up to<br>reach their potential<br>and i think that true leadership is<br>really the role of becoming a servant<br>and serving the people under you and<br>making sure that they are getting<br>their needs met getting fulfilled in<br>what they do and seeing them<br>you know reach what they've been made to<br>become<br>so i want to get into that area but what<br>actual organization or where in the<br>world<br>i mean i'm not sure it means i get to<br>do things like this and talk on camera<br>and really support<br>and make sure the scholarship is<br>reflected for what it is<br>it really does equip people to excel in<br>any given area<br>i mean the surman hiri scholarship has<br>people from the sporting<br>arena and also the arts arena it really<br>is incorporating all different<br>spheres making sure we're not just<br>relegating some areas and saying you're<br>not as important<br>it really boosts boosts everyone gives<br>them the support they need<br>they're always trying to improve the<br>scholarship even while i was on the<br>scholarship i saw areas of improvement<br>getting speakers in getting feedback and<br>i get to<br>be an alumni i get to show you what the<br>scholarship can help you to become so<br>hopefully i'm a good role model for that<br>and just really give of myself and help<br>promote it and help promote<br>most of all just the underlying beliefs<br>values of what it is truly trying to<br>propagate within the individuals on the<br>scholarship<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
