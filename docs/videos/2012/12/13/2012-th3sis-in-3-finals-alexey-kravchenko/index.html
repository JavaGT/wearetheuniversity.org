Kravchenko.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I was talking about I was just thinking<br>about I had one of the most magical and<br>special experiences of My Life um in a<br>little village in the north of kabas uh<br>it was an hour and a half boat ride<br>across the harbor to this boarding<br>school where kids from all over the the<br>little atos had come and we were arrived<br>we were greeted by the students we they<br>took us through the school they showed<br>us where the students themselves just<br>High School age prepared all of their<br>own food and then they led us into this<br>a beautiful Meeting House out on this<br>Lagoon and they sang singularly the most<br>beautiful songs I think I have ever<br>heard in my life and there was not a<br>teacher to be seen anywhere the kids<br>looked after themselves entirely and it<br>was a a stunning and almost surreal<br>experience but what really struck me as<br>those kids sat there and they sang These<br>incredible songs was here was this here<br>is this wonderful gift that I think you<br>know and then I came back to New Zealand<br>and I I listened to particularly our<br>European culture singing in places and<br>when why why don't we have that anymore<br>where's that gone so you know I think I<br>don't know what I was get into at this<br>point other than filling time between<br>the judges marking but it's somewhere<br>along the way I think if you've got a<br>kid you know no matter who they let's<br>encourage them to sing because my God it<br>is a joyous experience and I think we<br>have really lost that part of pleasure<br>in our lives um D tribe over the judges<br>have deliberated ladies and gentlemen<br>from the White Management school where I<br>suspect there is not a lot of<br>singing there could be uh we're going to<br>be singing the Praises nonetheless of<br>this<br>thesis wow how did I do that<br>um on nothing trivial about New<br>Zealand's freshwater Sage shortage Alex<br>uh Kinko will introduce a counter<br>inuitive notion that New Zealand is<br>facing a freshwater shortage and then<br>we'll talk about his research aims to<br>help to address this issue will you<br>please welcome from wo management School<br>Alex<br>Kinko<br>taoto now when I mentioned that I<br>studied New Zealand shortage of water<br>the reaction I get from most people is<br>that of confusion and suspicion like my<br>youngest daughter right there most<br>people seem to think that it's not an<br>issue in fact please raise your hand<br>right now if you think that there is a<br>shortage of water in New<br>Zealand no hands well one well most of<br>you are correct in a sense uh because we<br>do have one of the highest levels of<br>renewable freshwater per capita in the<br>world the problem however is that most<br>of that water needs to be left in rivers<br>and lakes for the sake of ecological<br>recreational and cultural values and<br>only a small portion can be taken out<br>and used for anything else and in many<br>areas this small portion has already<br>been fully allocated between cities and<br>Farms but the demand from cities and<br>Farms keeps on growing<br>as the law stands now whoever got the<br>permission first to take out water has<br>essentially blocked out all the<br>subsequent<br>users um in in fact just recently a<br>number of dairy farms who are the<br>biggest freshwater users have been<br>denied permission to take out water<br>because no more allocatable water was<br>available this um first com for surf<br>method is not really an efficient method<br>of allocating scarce<br>resources in economics a common remedy<br>is to increase the<br>price right now the water in rivers and<br>lakes is essentially free but if you're<br>going to start making City Cs and Farms<br>pay for that water how much would you<br>charge them there are very few studies<br>even remotely looking at this issue and<br>one of them went as far as to say that<br>it's impossible to derive such a value<br>but that's precisely what I'm trying to<br>do here and so far I've been analyzing<br>financial and production data of about<br>th000 dairy farms next I'll be emailing<br>service to dairy farms and try to find<br>out how much are they willing to pay for<br>that water but without actually asking<br>them that because if you do ask them<br>they might no idea or<br>lie with the methodology I develop I'll<br>also be able to see if the responses I<br>get are truthful or um they're just<br>simple random click that nobody cares<br>about when they do<br>surveys uh my final goal My ultimate<br>goal is to use all this data that I<br>collected and to build an economic model<br>of New Zealand's water usage I'll then<br>be able to predict how any pricing<br>mechanism affects the different sectors<br>of the New Zealand<br>economy so in conclusion I'm not saying<br>that we all should pee in the shower to<br>conserve water that's what people in<br>Brazil are told to do true<br>story but I am saying that the current<br>allocation mechanism is significantly<br>inefficient and is inadequate to keep up<br>with the growing demand and I hope that<br>my model will help with establishment of<br>a better way to share our most valuable<br>yet ironically our most undervalued<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
