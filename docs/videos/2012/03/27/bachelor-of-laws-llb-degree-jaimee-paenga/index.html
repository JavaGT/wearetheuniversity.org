font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is jamie piner<br>and i am a law student and a faculty or<br>sorry a management student<br>so i'm in my fourth year now and um i've<br>actually come back to hamilton and come<br>back to waikato university<br>i spent um i was born in hamilton and<br>then i spent a lot of my sort of<br>childhood<br>wandering around new zealand i finished<br>my schooling in auckland<br>and then i decided and i purposely chose<br>to come to waikato so<br>the reasons that i came to to this<br>university and especially this faculty<br>was because i heard it had a really good<br>reputation for supportive students and i<br>knew quite a lot of<br>um i knew of quite a lot of the<br>lecturers so when i first came here that<br>was exactly what i got there was<br>straight support and one story that i<br>always tell um anyone who asked me what<br>law school i go to<br>is that in my very first class i had a<br>lecturer stand up in front of 250<br>students and say look to your left and<br>look to your right<br>those are your colleagues for the next<br>four years don't burn your bridges<br>now that story always gathers a couple<br>of laughs from other law schools<br>who um who don't get told that and who<br>are very competitive<br>but one great thing about waikato law<br>school is that we're not like that<br>there are student mentors and then there<br>are<br>obviously academic mentors so one good<br>thing<br>that waikido also does is that they<br>recycle their students into helping them<br>so once you get to your sort of third<br>and fourth year you end up getting<br>involved in helping the laws go out with<br>new students so<br>one a couple of things that i've done is<br>that i help out with the law student for<br>a day which is one thing that<br>i actually got into the first in my<br>first<br>coming into my first year and as well as<br>doing orientation days so<br>what's really great about that is that i<br>get to meet new students come in i get<br>to<br>help them out and see them through the<br>situations that i was going through<br>so that's really great as well so one of<br>the other great things about waikato law<br>school<br>is that all the extracurriculars so we<br>have two main societies on campus the<br>first one is<br>walsa who are waikato law students<br>association so they organize a lot of<br>events<br>a lot of networking groups a lot of<br>meetings with lawyers and they also do<br>some competitions they also provide<br>mentoring services so this allows<br>other students to be mentors to younger<br>students or your third and fourth year<br>so that's once the once again<br>cycling the students back into the into<br>the law school<br>the other one is the debating society<br>and so we're they're mainly<br>law students and they allow you to go to<br>different tournaments<br>throughout the university and compete<br>with other other law societies including<br>auckland waikato victoria canterbury and<br>otago<br>now this also helps with doing your<br>mooting and stuff like that because it's<br>good for really public speaking<br>getting your confidence up and learning<br>something new and getting a bit more<br>quick with it<br>now another thing about look like a law<br>student because the supports there we<br>have these<br>labs so we have our own little labs<br>where you can find students studying<br>until<br>four five six o'clock in the morning but<br>the good thing about it is that there's<br>always somebody there and there's always<br>somebody to help you<br>so there's always groups of people<br>working there and if you're sort of<br>finding yourself a little bit stuck<br>you can come in ask somebody who looks a<br>little bit more<br>experienced than you and they'll always</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
