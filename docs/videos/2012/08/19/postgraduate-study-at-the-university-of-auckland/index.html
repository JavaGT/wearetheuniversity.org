accurate.</p><p>the University of ockland offers<br>postgraduate students of world-class<br>education we've got great resources<br>great supervisors wonderful courses<br>students can do and a lot of<br>support the postgraduate Student<br>Association is a place where<br>postgraduates come together and they uh<br>meet people in other faculties uh who<br>are postgraduates and they do events<br>together and they also uh any concerns<br>that you may have you can bring to your<br>elected<br>representatives postgraduate study can<br>be lonely especially if you work in a<br>soulle author sort of discipline the<br>wonderful thing is there are 10,000 of<br>you out there including 2,000 doctoral<br>students so if you feel you're alone<br>you're not there are great opportunities<br>to meet other people through the<br>seminars and workshops offered in the<br>Library career services it and a whole<br>host of fun things you do too Center for<br>brain research throws events<br>occasionally like the Trivial Pursuit<br>night a couple of nights couple of weeks<br>ago Pub quizzes and stuff like that and<br>soccer we have Center for brain research<br>brain Auckland itself is a gorgeous city<br>which is very walkable and it has a very<br>warm populace between symphony<br>orchestras and movies it's just a very<br>vibrant City and it's an amazing things<br>to see<br>we have dedicated postgraduate areas we<br>have our desk here um as a master<br>student and as a PhD students we have<br>allocated desk so we have our own<br>workspace here which is really important<br>so I think that really helps to Foster<br>the research environment Tona wanang has<br>been really supportive and has got a MTI<br>postgraduate student space and with me<br>being on study leave at the moment<br>that's just been amazing there is the<br>strata lounge and that is specifically<br>for post graduate students to come and<br>to study and to just relax it's a space<br>where you can get lunch and hang out<br>with your<br>friends at the school of Graduate<br>Studies we look after all the doctoral<br>students right across the university so<br>at the beginning of your doctoral<br>candidature you come along meet with one<br>of our postgraduate advisors and they<br>take you through all the rules and<br>regulations you need to know we'll also<br>take your thesis at the end very happily<br>when you submit after 3 to 4 years of<br>study<br>over the course of my tenure as<br>University librarian we've been moving<br>the solid print Foundation that the<br>library had to the digital environment<br>we now spend over 70% of our very<br>substantial collections Budget on<br>digital<br>materials one of the things that gives<br>us great pleasure is academics who<br>return from sabatical overseas and let<br>us know how well the University Library<br>ranks with uh where they've been on<br>sabatical which are often in prestigious<br>universities and internationally and<br>they come back and say that in the end<br>they actually started using the<br>University of Oakland collection where<br>they were internationally rather than<br>using the local collection coming from a<br>European University I think the first<br>thing which was quite impressive for me<br>was the library um I think the library<br>has access to all um journals or<br>textbooks or books that have been<br>written um in the world so if if I know<br>of a book I would like to read I'm I'm<br>sure that I get it through our library<br>postgraduate students usually develop a<br>very strong relationship with their<br>subject librarian we see them when<br>especially when they come from overseas<br>when they do feel a little bit lost when<br>they come to University of Oakland the<br>subject librarian is their entry into<br>the library into the world of<br>information and information resources<br>here so they established these<br>relationships they come to them for<br>advice but particularly on how to use<br>this extensive library system that we<br>have here<br>the doctoral skills program is overseen<br>by the school of Graduate Studies we<br>work with people in Career Services<br>Library it all sorts of different forms<br>of support for students there's a<br>doctoral skills program that offers<br>courses on a whole range of topics like<br>Excel and end note to writing up your<br>thesis and you know giving presentations<br>and it's really easy just go along to<br>them if you kind of want a little bit of<br>help on<br>something we're about to go live with<br>our online scholarship applications<br>which means that students will be able<br>to find it much easier to find matching<br>scholarships once they give us a set of<br>information and data about<br>themselves well we have a pot of over<br>$30 million that we hand out to students<br>annually from the University of ockland<br>and of that 30 million $23 million goes<br>towards<br>postgraduates I got the University of<br>Oakland doctoral scholarship which has<br>been a huge help because it pays for all<br>my tuition fees and gives me you know<br>sty in for living cost<br>and one of our popular scholarships is<br>the Master's honors PG dip scholarship<br>that's usually applied for the year<br>prior to entry to one of those courses<br>and it's a very generous scholarship<br>allowing<br>$10,000 annually paid as a stien and<br>tuition fees to students and those uh<br>scholarships range right up to $25,000<br>per anom for a doctoral student and if<br>you are doing a PhD or another doctorate<br>we also have something unique to the<br>University of Oakland it's called The<br>Press account each year<br>each doctoral candidate is entitled to a<br>sum of money that they can use for<br>funding research trips overseas<br>conference visits and basically<br>supporting the research that you're<br>doing there are opportunities for<br>postgraduates to apply for tutoring and<br>you get to work with a professor you<br>work under a professor they're<br>incredible opportunity for you to be<br>able to learn how to teach and learn<br>what the actual life of an academic is<br>their great introduction to to this one<br>reason people do postgraduate studies is<br>because on average you earn more with a<br>postgraduate degree than you do just<br>with an undergraduate degree but I think<br>postgraduate study is a lot more than<br>the bottom line on the salary check it's<br>also about the intellectual challenge<br>it's about the opportunities it's about<br>pushing yourself it's about learning a<br>lot more in depth about the subjects</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
