Having grown up in a family with a strong focus on helping others, she decided a career in social work would fulfil her passion for social justice and her desire to help others in a practical way.<br><br>"I love studying in a smaller campus -- you get to know the people in your class really well and have more time to talk to the lecturers.<br><br>"I'm from a small town called Waitara in Taranaki. I've always loved the feel of Auckland City so I knew I would really enjoy living here. I feel like the city changes every week with new festivals and concerts; there's so much to keep you entertained here. I'm discovering new places all the time and every suburb has something different to offer."<br><br>Find out more: www.makeyourmark.ac.nz</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi I Milania pocket and I'm studying a<br>Bachelor of Social Work at the<br>University of Woolford I'm of T ottawa<br>in european descent and was born and<br>raised in tub hockey but moved up to<br>auckland and start of 2011 to start my<br>degree I thing in the evening papers<br>along with students and human services<br>counseling and education Gibson gave us<br>was a really cool place to study we have<br>our own library a swimming hope<br>tennis court<br>even a great shoot haha it's got a real<br>harmony five to us but it's also close<br>to the city if you're addicted to coffee<br>in my opinion love living in Auckland<br>and out of the city this is my favorite<br>at night I just comes out of my first<br>semester of college and as I'm 18 mother<br>straps i'm currently at the top of one<br>tree hill which is an amazing place to<br>come and sing a 360 degree view of this<br>awesome sitting this is kamal park I<br>love coming here to escape the busyness<br>of the city there's lots of scenic<br>walking tracks and there's some sweet<br>spot and attachment phenomenally chose<br>or grabbing coffee i'm using yeah and<br>that's that let's come in and check it<br>out before heading into this black I<br>don't know any of the girls but now<br>let's become like my family away from my<br>family back home I'm pretty excited<br>about the career opportunities i will<br>have once been planning my bachelor<br>social social it is such an interesting<br>field there's so many different areas<br>you can go into working for both<br>government and non-government<br>organization at the moment and thinking<br>hands after work with children and<br>school bus was getting my degree from<br>the University of Auckland and I'll be<br>recognized not only yet but overseas<br>which is really cool because I'd love to<br>it in England for a few years and travel<br>around Europe I chose the University of<br>Auckland because from its great facility<br>to city living it is so much sharper I</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
