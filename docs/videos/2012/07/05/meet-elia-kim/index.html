Elia chose this programme of study as he has ambitions to work for the United Nations and saw economics as something that affects everyone, managing the flow and administration of both countries and households.<br><br>"I chose to study at the University of Auckland because if I'm going to invest my time and money studying at any university in New Zealand, I want to be at the best. Moreover, I believed that this University would attract the most talented students in New Zealand, and I would have the opportunity to meet other inspiring and talented peers to form strong, lasting networks."<br><br>Find out more: http://www.makeyourmark.ac.nz</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi my name is aliia and I'm from Mount R<br>School Oakland I currently study at the<br>University of Oakland and I study a law<br>and commerce conjoint degree majoring in<br>economics and behind me is our new<br>business mod let me show you guys around<br>hey guys so I've just finished an<br>economics lecture here in one of the<br>many lecture theaters in the business<br>school um in the GL building there's his<br>lecture theaters computer labs and<br>okay so as a business school student you<br>get a lot of support from the University<br>behind me is the ASB career center and<br>this is where you can come to get your<br>CV and cover letter check but more<br>importantly if you have no idea what you<br>want to do as a career after your<br>studies you can come in and have a chat<br>and they'll s you down on the right<br>pathway and tell you all about the<br>different options that are open to you<br>after you finish your studies one of my<br>create aspirations as to go into<br>Consulting and by joining the management<br>consulting Club in the business school<br>this is definitely gotten me closer to<br>achieving that career aspiration luckily<br>this year I was chosen to represent the<br>university twice this meant that I was<br>put into a team and I had to come up<br>with different business strategies for<br>different business<br>issues the management concerting club is<br>a great way to get involved and apply<br>what you learn in your Commerce courses<br>but also to meet other people that are<br>doing a Commerce degree but maybe in<br>different years too and uh this is the<br>general Library I'd like to come here<br>just in between lectures to to get some<br>study done I especially like to go to<br>the sixth floor where there's a really<br>study so one of the main reasons why I<br>chose to come to Oakland was because I<br>received the University of Oakland<br>scholarship there PID for my fees all my<br>fees for 3 years and also I received<br>$2,500 that goes to helping with my<br>living costs um this is a huge support<br>for me and gave me the freedom and time<br>to focus on my studies get involved with<br>things such as you and you<br>and the management consulting Club also<br>Inland we have all the big commercial<br>and law firms here so there's definitely<br>a lot of opportunity for you once you<br>graduation hey so I'm here at the B<br>Theater at the University and I've just<br>finished watching The Crucible there's<br>heaps of shows and events always on at<br>the theater so you can take a break from<br>stud come over here and watch whatever<br>interests<br>you okay guys so I'm here at the union<br>rec center right now I like come here a<br>few times a week just to work out and<br>release the stress then here at the<br>University we got some mean equipment so<br>around hey guys so I'm here with my<br>friends from action group from student<br>cus um so we meet pretty much once a<br>week and just hang out and chill up um<br>once a week on Fridays and there's HS of<br>other support groups like student life<br>here on C<br>um it's a great way to meet other people<br>from different<br>faculties so university is in the Heart<br>of the City we're on Queen right now<br>which is like 2 3 minutes walk from the<br>uni and there's heat and Shop more shops<br>there<br>shops okay so our favorite day is<br>Thursday and that's cuz that's Market<br>day here at the University as you can<br>see this keeps the stools around um<br>but more poly Thursday means churos so<br>I'm sitting here in W quarter it's just<br>at the bottom of Queen Street and it's<br>one of my favorite places to visit when<br>I have spare time I hope I've persuaded<br>you to give the University of Oakland<br>and try personally I chose to come to<br>University of Oakland because I was<br>caliber of teaching and for the support<br>you get for your studies but also for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
