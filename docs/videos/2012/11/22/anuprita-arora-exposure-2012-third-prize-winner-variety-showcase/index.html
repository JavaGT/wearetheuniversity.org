day<br>while sitting down and having coffee<br>after all it could be an accident<br>but then it was the other day<br>mine was busy gardening where the wave<br>she soon stopped exercising as she saw<br>plenty of family in france<br>she lost a smile on the face she lost<br>the glow<br>and<br>urinary incontinence<br>it means the involuntary riches of<br>europe<br>around 10<br>of the population is affected by it<br>women are four times more likely to have<br>a supporter<br>two hundred thousand new zealand women<br>have this condition<br>and yes it goes unnoticed because of the<br>massive social statement<br>associated with it<br>this is a picture of the peninsula the<br>bladder as we know holds the fluid and<br>the urethra issue while is the fluid<br>flows out<br>and i'm going to demonstrate this<br>by using<br>so if this is a bladder<br>now during better filling the bladder<br>muscles are quite relaxed<br>it's the urethra which is a 2 million<br>here which is clear talk about strength<br>analysis it's only when we choose to<br>void<br>my area of research is to do with stress<br>urinary incontinence and this means<br>incontinence caused by exercise or<br>activity now as we go about doing a<br>daily exercises like we're coughing<br>relaxing we're jumping or we're sneezing<br>we create an increase in our<br>inter-abdominal pressure and that's<br>pressure inside your abdomen<br>now this pressure is translated all the<br>better you can tell but if something<br>else the bladder muscles or the urethral<br>muscles are not strong enough to oppose<br>this pressure so what we get is<br>involuntary leakage<br>now can you imagine the lives of people<br>who are affected by this disorder<br>someone like maya who gives out the<br>social life<br>and it's embarrassing women lose their<br>character they leave their personality<br>they're scared to talk about it because<br>it's almost a taboo in society today<br>and this is where your dynamics comes in<br>it's about measuring this<br>intra-abdominal pressure about measuring<br>the pressure in your bladder<br>so we can make diagnostics we can<br>understand what causes incontinence and<br>how can we treat it<br>and i'm going to demonstrate this<br>in my very own clinic here<br>for the next five minutes i want to be a<br>now<br>this recognition goes inside the patient<br>she's connected to her now she's<br>connected to this pressure transducer<br>this is like a pressure measuring device<br>and she's connected by a long to<br>waterfall to use this is now connected<br>to a computer where i can wash my<br>precious pressure signals<br>during your dynamics what happens is the<br>patient is asked to do a couple of<br>activities like coughing or jumping so<br>we can estimate what pressures and what<br>activities cause leakage<br>i'm going to admire to do a series of<br>course<br>small medium and big and you will be<br>able to see it on the screen what the<br>small cuts<br>medium<br>as you can tell<br>maya cannot take those pressures her<br>bladder cannot taste expression which is<br>now there are quite a few problems with<br>this regular system as i said if connect<br>location is connected to the sensor is<br>connected to this pressure transducer<br>while this long waterfall is used and<br>that's where you get the problems<br>first of all we have motion artifacts if<br>um<br>if we move the lives too much the<br>pressure signals<br>if they're evolved in the system if the<br>conditions are having a really busy day<br>they're not going to check it properly<br>but that causes inaccuracies in our<br>pressure readings you have paracelsus<br>respect for contraction because it's<br>interference most importantly that<br>pressure sensor going around goes up a<br>very uncomfortable role and most of our<br>patients are elderly females who often<br>complain about this procedure being<br>uncomfortable and sometimes painful<br>so the clinicians at melbourne hospital<br>they approached us and opened the open<br>bioengineering institute to see if we<br>can come up with a better solution<br>now we've known for a while that the<br>vagina is an excellent spot for<br>measuring infrastructural pressures as<br>well so what we have developed<br>is this<br>compressor device<br>the way it works is you have the silicon<br>balloon this is filled with water it has<br>a sensor in it<br>so let's see and that's connected to<br>this transmitter and battery the idea is<br>this part was inside the vagina<br>this part is taken for a woman's time<br>she said she has to repeat the same<br>protocol cough or jump and we can then<br>see what activities and what pressure<br>causes leakage the beauty of the system<br>wireless see all the signals are<br>transmitted wirelessly to a receiver in<br>the 10 meter release within the room<br>also the shape of this device is made to<br>follow the contours of the vagina it's<br>made from a material silicon thin and<br>compliant which aids in comfort and also<br>retention<br>and this is what my project has been<br>about let's it's been about developing<br>this device so we can take it into your<br>dynamics clinic and hopefully one day<br>provide an alternative way of measuring<br>infrastructure pressure and hopefully<br>replace that vector system at this point<br>so my job has been to redesign the<br>balloon i have been looking at ways to<br>probably make this a little bit better<br>what i have worked on is reducing the<br>length of it so that we have no<br>interference from pelvic floor muscles<br>any any interactions we have no<br>interference from that i've also been<br>looking at<br>making the production of these balloons<br>a little bit easier and faster the<br>previous method we used it took about a<br>day to make one balloon now with a new<br>machine we<br>bought<br>a one balloon takes about seven minutes<br>to reduce the production time by at<br>least 100.<br>future work that i have yet to do with<br>this device i now have ethics to take<br>this device into a proper euro dynamics<br>clinic and test it in 24 patients our<br>idea is to have<br>system in the patient along with our<br>horizontal sensor so we can estimate how<br>these two compare we can see how our<br>device fairs in terms of retention in<br>terms of comfort in terms of<br>measurements so we can fulfill a train<br>of providing a muscular system<br>i'm also looking at building a charger<br>so we can charge our device wirelessly<br>in the clinic i'm looking at building<br>user interface so that without a<br>collection representation so what i have<br>is my own system as opposed to an excel<br>system<br>i'm also looking at better ways to<br>connect my sensor to my balloon<br>our main idea is that these sensors are<br>actually 4 000 each so the tubing and<br>the balloon is is disposable so what we<br>are aiming to do is<br>have a good clickable system we provide<br>the clinic with the balloon and the<br>tubes and all the nurses have to do is<br>put it on the sensor and this cooks it<br>up but we still we still not there yet<br>we're still using ties and glue to put<br>it all together so that's another area<br>where we really have to work on so we<br>can actually make this a commercial<br>device finally i'm looking at<br>standards and regulations which are<br>necessary to take our device into our<br>commercial market<br>to conclude we have successfully created<br>a prototype to measure infrastructure<br>pressure<br>this is a long shot but our aim is to<br>one day replace the electrical system<br>with our system the women can have a<br>slightly better experience<br>now just to summarize<br>you say what i say pressure device you<br>say rare i say shove it out there<br>and goes to talk to acknowledge the<br>environment institute and our professors<br>and also the thank you for being wired<br>tonight<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
