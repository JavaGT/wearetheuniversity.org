I was thinking it was<br>more like the gaps the gaps oh yeah so<br>the guest<br>maybe the<br>system the kidneys as well because<br>it's yeah it'sing and it's draining a<br>society's relationship to its G system<br>is revealing a both a social and a<br>cultural level This research looks at<br>the psychosocial parallel between the<br>way we treat the human body in the body<br>of the city a city's Street gutter a<br>system of elimination<br>reflects society's ordered way of<br>dealing with certain functions and flows<br>likewise we have a certain hierarchical<br>Viewpoint of the body systems of<br>elimination the street gutter serves to<br>cleanse and drain or detoxify the city<br>but in its clumsiness it has become part<br>of a cycle of<br>toxification which circulates pollutants<br>from City to Sea to fish to mouth to gut<br>gut cigarette B this is our Collective<br>matters<br>think in the study of the correlation<br>between and dance I became interested in<br>how people relate to the gutter<br>environment as I walk through Oakland<br>City I notice how people walk alongside<br>the gutter how they step over the gutter<br>but I notic how they don't step into the<br>gutter and fact people seem to block out<br>the existence of the gutter as if it<br>wasn't there ignored forgotten not<br>seen I began to wonder what kinds of<br>human thoughts and feelings were driving<br>such human behaviors and did they<br>judgment the gutter becomes a symbol of<br>how Society hides denies and ignores<br>what is considered unclean dirty<br>shameful or private the recycling of a<br>society's underlying beliefs thoughts<br>and judgments keeps alive a collective<br>psychology of this system of<br>elimination kind of a nice letter<br>years my aim for This research then was<br>to rethink our relationship with the<br>gutter and to challenge its design and<br>function of<br>elimination the research questions how<br>might I reveal the culture of a gutter<br>system through dance thought<br>experimentation I have investigated this<br>question through workshops with dancers<br>and solo performance experiments at<br>local city gutter sites such as the GS<br>of Simon Street and karang happy<br>Road my understanding of what a g is<br>though began to expand to include the<br>fountain in Albert Park where people<br>gather to<br>psychically detox to cleanse and to<br>drain the gutter ology emerged as a<br>cycling of ideas manifested as human<br>behavior in regards to the binaries of<br>public for the dance the experiments I<br>have drawn upon Del and gitari's notion<br>of becoming to play with the possibility<br>of becoming gut I experiment with<br>becoming through shifting my attention<br>and focus to EXP explore the relations<br>of movement and rest speed and slowness<br>that are closest to what one is<br>becoming using my subjective experience<br>of a lived body as the site for<br>collecting data I have recorded and<br>Trace the experience of becoming gutter<br>in relation to the spatial Dynamics and<br>politics of a gutter<br>site here is one example of a dance<br>thought experiment into becoming G I<br>enter into co-presence with the scut<br>ecology through an orifice in the body<br>of the<br>tree a small hole just big enough to<br>squeeze<br>through I slow down to sense the scatter<br>spatial<br>Dynamics the GS<br>herey [ __ ] clean I trace the presence<br>of performative objects within the<br>ecology's parameter traces of human<br>behavior in a gutter environment portals<br>for channeling past present and future<br>gutter<br>cultures becoming gutter inside the<br>hollow tree is at first embarrassed it<br>is tight and nervous then it softens<br>dissolves it is majestic swooning<br>there's a little head here<br>too the Rocks kind of stuck in but I can<br>go into them what emerge from this<br>becoming gutter experiment was a gutter<br>metaphor in this case the gutter site is<br>named Meta gutter this would become part<br>of an archive of metaphorical gutters<br>nowhere further full block gifts from<br>the gutter mind in the gutter and you're<br>draining<br>me to the<br>ground this research project has<br>revealed two main findings becoming<br>gutter yields a shift and awareness from<br>self-consciousness to a profound<br>concentration on sensation and feeling<br>this shift and awareness opens up the<br>world of the gutter to instances and<br>encounters with Transcendence and<br>Grandeur the fluttering reflection of a<br>seagull across the watery surface of a<br>blocked<br>gutter the underworld of the cigarette<br>butf drain as it morphs to become a<br>palatial theater chain chamber with<br>elaborate sculptures and deeply moving<br>lighting<br>States the world of the gutter explodes<br>into multi-dimensional<br>spaces<br>Rock secondly an individual's<br>relationship to the gutter is subjective<br>psychological and complex through these<br>becoming gutter dance thought<br>experiments my subjective gutter<br>metaphor emerges as channels of<br>Shame reflecting the experience of a<br>heightened awareness of my gendered and<br>sexualized body when experienced in<br>proximity to the<br>gutter would the gutter system serve to<br>eliminate me or would I invisibilize my<br>this performance reverberates channels<br>of<br>Shame as a<br>my sh<br>my<br>my I got
