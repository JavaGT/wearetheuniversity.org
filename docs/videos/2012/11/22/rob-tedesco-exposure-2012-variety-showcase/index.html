study<br>methodology and PRI research comparing<br>two orchestras and the implications of<br>the<br>St orchestras are looked at and said to<br>be dying it said that orchestras are are<br>going bankrupt there there's nothing we<br>can do about them they're they're not<br>valued by<br>Society so I am researching this Valu we<br>have had the Philadelphia Orchestra the<br>um H Symphony and Detroit Symphony in<br>the United States all have serious<br>finding issues in the past DEC<br>um in Great Britain $300 million need to<br>be cut from ARS funding in the<br>on the value has changed and I intend to<br>before before it used to be 200 years<br>ago 100 years ago when the orchest was<br>now that is change little<br>today today when we think of popular<br>it now the objectives of my study are<br>this in this St I will argue that the<br>dynamic between Wellington and aen has<br>had a detrimental impact on orchestr in<br>the city from 1940 to 2012<br>and I say this for two reasons one<br>because Wellington is the capital the Au<br>um the nzso has been the national<br>Orchestra and two because only 11% of<br>the population actually go to PL which<br>means that it is a cultural minority<br>aspect because people say that we should<br>go to the orchestras and yet 89% of the<br>population doesn't actually go which is<br>problem so the the ways I'm going to<br>study this are I'm going to actually go<br>and watch concerts see who's going how<br>many people are going are they sold up<br>are they not sold<br>up I'm going to go and look at archives<br>I'm going to look to see you know what<br>is the history of orch how is the<br>history going to created what happened<br>in the past with orchestras that has led<br>to them being how they are today and<br>what's going to go on in the<br>future possibly I'm also going to look<br>at the economics of the orare as well<br>how have the economics affected on the<br>development orry in the city ofland and<br>on the global scale as<br>well now the research on this is is very<br>verying but there are a couple of uh<br>prent points that comes up the first one<br>is what is a syon concert you know where<br>did it come from how did it form to be<br>what it<br>is second<br>is what has music had an effect on<br>society obviously we all enjoy music<br>there's some effect of us fast some of<br>us<br>popular and finally we look at many<br>facets I've seen from Government funding<br>to building participation in<br>well for the theoretical aspects um I'm<br>using Timothy Taylor and William B<br>Bowman and<br>davidi for<br>pier um he has two cultural and social<br>capital and what he says is you have to<br>you have to learn to to enjoy this music<br>you have to build their participation<br>you have to have a special code and you<br>have to take Society has to take this<br>music and actually make it into<br>something um that is perent and relevant<br>to that Society so what he has done is<br>is with<br>the music with Taylor um he says you<br>need to reify it you need to take it<br>this is something that we bought to so<br>such as a CD such as an iPod such as a<br>recorded recorded news and ticket Sals<br>as well now there's something wrong with<br>the uh for the economics of Music uh you<br>can't exactly have an orchestra concert<br>without an orchestra really um and<br>there's a set amount of pots that go to<br>that especially since something like a<br>town hall or the a center have a very<br>fixed amount of seats that you can use<br>so there's a fixed CA there and your<br>amount of you sell you can't actually<br>here at least you get to see um an<br>orchestra you go to see an orchestra you<br>don't go to see one violist so I can't<br>take instrumentalists away and say this<br>is I'm just going to do M's 5ifth myself<br>I need an orchestra that's your us so<br>there are three ways to do this<br>governmental<br>support then there's where the<br>government actually subsidizes it which<br>is what New Zealand does then you have<br>private funding where private citizens<br>or private companies actually fund the<br>orchestr the third one that I identifi<br>is called the business Enterprise model<br>where an orchestra actually is able to<br>go out and sell enough tickets<br>recordings merchandise in order to fund<br>their<br>activities this no professional<br>Orchestra in the world is able to do<br>that it is 150 years ago yes they were<br>value of the music has changed no<br>Orchestra can do that not might be fil<br>just saw not the vi armonic not the<br>nzo so it's a problem you need some sort<br>of<br>subs for the New Zealand Symphony it was<br>created in 1946 as the<br>government the purpose was basically a<br>symbol of the country's cultural<br>maturity and it was to go around to all<br>of New Zealand and bring orchestral<br>music to cities and towns so it was<br>based in lton went to Auckland Umar it<br>went down to Christ Church toen wherever<br>and it traveled around now in<br>1940 the AUM string players were created<br>it was a very much a part-time Ensemble<br>and they did Lun time concerts but by<br>1967 they started they had added winds<br>and Brass in percussion by 1975 this<br>Orchestra was a full-time symphon<br>Orchestra the symphon of by 1980 it went<br>bankrupt and the city said we do not<br>want to save you you are not important<br>to us you were just going to let you go<br>bankrupt I'm sorry we don't have the<br>money to fund you the players decided<br>that they were going to form their own<br>Ensemble and own their own Ensemble<br>themselves they own the a fonia when<br>they when they started<br>it which is first in the world no organ<br>ever been owned by the players<br>before unfortunately at in 20 4 this<br>Orchestra was bankrupt again except<br>something happened the city said you<br>know what we're going to save you we're<br>you are important to us so creative New<br>Zealand a city and concerned citizens<br>banded together and they were able to<br>save the orchestra the players no longer<br>own it but it has a CEO and what they do<br>is they said we're going to go out with<br>the community we are going to become<br>relevant to our community so what they<br>did was they started something<br>called they give in it's based inara and<br>they give instruments to children and<br>they teach them music and they also<br>teach them um societal values how to be<br>a good person how to work together in a<br>team because that's what an orchestra<br>is so that's what they are doing to make<br>Community as I said Society has play<br>some sort of value music and the Au fony<br>is trying to become that valued in the<br>community because the so travels around<br>and they're based among them they can't<br>be the same type they can't have the<br>same type of community involvement as<br>the<br>APO<br>because the APO is is becoming centr the<br>community the N so travels<br>around<br>however the year funding foro is $4.4<br>million the NSO is 13.5 New Zealand<br>spends about $24 million in total on or<br>R every year so the nzso gets more than<br>half of that and the other money is<br>divided on three other or the APO the<br>Dena um Vector Wellington and also the<br>pr sh syy with the APO getting about 2.5<br>million and the a city donating about<br>2.5 as well for 48% of their total<br>revenue with the N that so the<br>government suppies<br>71% there is an orchestral review going<br>on right now where there said where in<br>the first time 70 years what they're<br>doing is they're looking at how do we<br>actually<br>get Equitable funding for orchest so my<br>research is looking at what has the APO<br>done what is Theo doing to to be<br>relevant to their communities and how is<br>this going to impact their orchestras<br>and other or can then look at this and<br>say these education programs are<br>actually working because no one's<br>actually ever looked at Systema programs<br>it's a worldwide movement from uh<br>Venezuela and no one has actually ever<br>looked at saying well it looks like a<br>good idea but we have no idea if it<br>actually is but the APO is doing it and<br>there are research this so my research<br>goes right into this so that you can see<br>it is actually<br>working and to help government figure<br>out how do we make sure that we have a<br>national orchest and a very strong op<br>well the void between classical music<br>and popular one music is an artificial<br>one all societies must have music<br>because there's been no Society we<br>actually found that does not have music<br>going around all over the world there's<br>some sort of musical<br>tradition so it is Central and if I were<br>to sing those to you and you were to<br>sing them back you'd be able to do it<br>because we are all part of this whole<br>musical field we have all listen to it<br>we all enjoy<br>it so it all relates to Value this<br>picture is from the AL F aronia when<br>they actually had rap artist come in and<br>discuss<br>um and they have rap Writers come in and</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
