style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hello my name is Emily and I am a PhD<br>student in materials engineering but<br>unlike most materials Engineers I don't<br>study those boring materials like<br>Plastics metals and Ceramics I actually<br>study a biological material cartilage<br>I'm interested in its micr structure and<br>material prop properties and how they<br>change in the disease<br>osteoarthritis now unfortunately I won't<br>be demonstrating my research to you<br>using interpretive dance but um I will<br>be doing a short science experiment to<br>demonstrate the purpose of cartilage<br>I'll also talk to you about some of the<br>treatments we currently have for<br>osteoarthritis why they aren't very good<br>and what Engineers like me are doing to<br>treatments so I'm sure most of you guys<br>know a little bit about cartilage for<br>those of you that don't it's the<br>material that lines your joint and makes<br>movement smooth and painfree so this is<br>a picture of your knee joint without the<br>kneecap in the way and that white<br>material and the ends of each bone is<br>cartilage cartilage is actually a really<br>amazing material there's less friction<br>generated between the two surfaces of<br>cartilage rubbing together then a<br>sharpened ice skate on ice then a steel<br>spatula on a Teflon pan then any solid<br>man-made materials we cannot make<br>materials as frictionless as cartilage<br>cartilage also doesn't contain any ner<br>which means that standing and moving is<br>pain<br>free cartilage acts to cushion your<br>joints imagine for a moment if your<br>joints didn't contain any cartridge and<br>Bone rubbed directly against bone now<br>bone is a hard material like um a hard<br>plastic chair or two pieces of glass so<br>these two pieces of glass are going to<br>represent our joints with no cartilage<br>bone is going to rub directly against<br>bone so this is one end of your joint<br>this is the other if we Liv in a perfect<br>world and our bone our bones were<br>perfectly aligned and our bones didn't<br>contain the imperfections rubbing them<br>together would be fine nothing<br>remarkable happens but we don't live in<br>a perfect world all living things<br>contain natural variability the surfaces<br>of our bones contain imperfections and<br>our joints are not perfectly aligned so<br>we can demonstrate these imperfections<br>by adding just a little bit of sand<br>between our surfaces of<br>garbage<br>together that sound represents the<br>destructive rubbing and pain felt at<br>bone were to rub against bone but<br>thankfully that's usually not the case<br>most of us will hopefully have some<br>cartilage left cartilage is a compliant<br>material like a cushion on a chair or a<br>piece of felt it compresses when it's<br>loaded so this piece of felt is going to<br>represent our cartilage we put it in our<br>joint even put some sand in there to<br>represent our imperfections in bone now<br>when we rub our two plates together no<br>sound that's great but in the disease<br>osteitis we lose our cartilage we go<br>back to the case where we have saved you<br>guys want we done let's break that sound<br>time so we know that osteoarthritis is a<br>degenerative disease of the joints where<br>the cartilage is lost and the underlying<br>bone is<br>exposed it's quite a common disease and<br>its prevalence increases with age so<br>that nearly everyone will experience<br>ostearthritis by the age of 70 even<br>Batman has ostearthritis in the latest<br>Dark Knight movie the most common joints<br>affected are the knee and the hip joints<br>and that's because they're the low<br>bearing joints of the body but we really<br>don't know what causes osteoarthritis we<br>know that some people have a genetic<br>predisposition to to developing it we<br>know that injuring your joint early in<br>life will make it more likely for you to<br>develop the disease later in life and<br>certain activities like long run and<br>certain types of dance like ballet will<br>increase your likelihood of developing<br>osteoid partis as well as diseases like<br>um obesity or metabolic<br>diseases there are currently no<br>treatments for<br>osteoarthritis let that sink in for a<br>moment no treatments for osteoarthritis<br>all of the treatments that we currently<br>have focus on reducing the pain once<br>from<br>osteoarthritis we have no method of<br>halting the progression of<br>osteoarthritis of the C degeneration we<br>have no way of repairing cartilage once<br>it's degenerate so when someone goes to<br>a doctor with joint pain from<br>osteoarthritis the general treatments<br>that are prescribed are medications so<br>you start with low dose medications such<br>as Panadol and as the pain increases you<br>move on to non-steroidal<br>anti-inflammatory drugs or strong<br>analgesics but it's only when patient<br>pain is too great for these<br>medications and um they can't perform<br>daily activities like walking around a<br>lot of pain the doctors will consider<br>performing a a surgical procedure and<br>the most common surgical procedure is a<br>total joint replacement and that's where<br>the bone and any remaining cartilage on<br>both sides of the joint is removed and<br>replaced with an artificial joint so<br>this is a human Femur from someone that<br>who is slightly taller than me um an an<br>AAL joint replacement of the hip all of<br>this bone here is completely removed and<br>replaced with this implant that they<br>Hammer into the bone<br>and this is your new hip joint on the<br>other side of the joint they remove the<br>bone there and replace it with this this<br>is lined with plastic a similar<br>procedure is done for the<br>knee if this is your knee<br>joint all of this bone is removed on<br>both sides of the joint and replace it<br>with something that looks like this it's<br>a metal joint also lined with plastic so<br>artificial joints are usually lined with<br>plastic but as I talked about earlier we<br>can't make plastic that's as<br>frictionless as cartilage also doesn't<br>compress as well as cartilage does and<br>it doesn't last very long cartilage can<br>last 80 to 90 years in some people but<br>plastic in a total joint replacement<br>will only last about 10 to 20 years and<br>replacement so all of our current<br>treatments for osteoarthritis are at<br>this stage of the disease after the<br>cartilage is already gone and the<br>patient feels pain but a potential area<br>for new treatments is earlier in the<br>disease before the car is degenerated<br>before the patient feels pain but we<br>currently can't do this because we can't<br>really detect this how do I know if you<br>have early ostearthritis if you don't<br>feel any pain so that's what I study I<br>study the earliest changes in<br>osteoarthritis and to do that I need a<br>supply of joints that have the carage<br>intact and aren't painful so if anyone<br>wants to donate a hip or a knee joint<br>that isn't painful um come see me<br>afterwards so instead of using humanin<br>tissue I Ed both Vine tissue I use the<br>kneecaps from cows and I go and I get<br>them from a meat processing plant and I<br>usually use the kneecaps from dairy cows<br>because they're kept alive long enough<br>that they start to experience<br>osteoarthritic changes so I can't really<br>use beef cows because they're killed too<br>young so what I do with these joints is<br>I look for microscopic changes that are<br>signifying early ostero rce so I take a<br>sample of the cartilage and bone of the<br>joint surface and I look at it in the<br>microscope so this is what a healthy<br>joint Sur<br>looks like on the top you have a layer<br>of cartilage and this is healthy because<br>you can see the surface of it at the top<br>is nice and smooth below that you have<br>the bone and between the two you have a<br>layer called calcifi cartilage I<br>actually studied this using a novel<br>microscopy preparation technique that<br>allows me to look at cartilage that's<br>fully hydrated the cartilage has water<br>in it um but most researchers when they<br>study cartilage they fully dehydrate it<br>embed it in wax and then look at it in<br>the microscope and this can alter the<br>structure of the cartilage and make it<br>harder to detect the small changes in<br>early<br>osteoarthritis so using my novel<br>microscopy preparation technique I did<br>mle small changes in the cartilage so<br>what does osto arthritis look like in<br>the microscope looks like this there's<br>no cartilage left that's just B um but<br>I'm not really interested in this I<br>can't do anything with this this is too<br>late so I'm interested in early<br>ostearthritis which looks something like<br>this these two pictures of a healthy<br>joint and early ostearthritis<br>or at the same magnification so you can<br>see that the cartilage on the right has<br>become thicker it's swollen and the<br>surface is no longer smooth it's IR<br>regular now this means that the<br>interconnections in the cartilage<br>holding it together have weakened I've<br>also been able to detect changes that<br>are occurring in the other tissues in<br>the bone and the califi cartilage so<br>this means that osteoarthritis isn't<br>just a disease of the cartilage it's<br>actually a disease of all of the joint<br>surfaces so if we zoom in on this area<br>here in the calcified carbage and Bone<br>we can really see what's going on there<br>are these strange structures that kind<br>of look like fingers the bone is growing<br>into the cartilage and these structures<br>resemble the structures that are in your<br>bone all the time replacing it 10 to 20%<br>of your bone is replaced every year by<br>structures that look pretty similar to<br>this but normally those structures stay<br>within the bone and don't start<br>traveling into the cartilage so<br>something is happening in osteitis<br>causing these structures to move into<br>the cartilage it thinner from underneath<br>as well as it being degenerated from<br>above so hopefully my research will<br>develop a better understanding of the<br>earliest changes in osteoarthritis so<br>that one day we can develop treatments<br>that we can apply earlier so that we no<br>longer need to treat the disease later<br>using treatments such as total joint<br>replacement and instead we can keep our<br>own carage that's much better than the<br>plastic stuff that we make thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
