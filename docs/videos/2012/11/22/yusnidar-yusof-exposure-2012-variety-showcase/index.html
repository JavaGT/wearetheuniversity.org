a<br>Scientist I won't save lives nor will I<br>find cure for<br>diseases but I do want to make a<br>difference I want to make a difference<br>to my children's<br>lives what I<br>is an<br>architect with an ability to design and<br>a passion for<br>education education Within<br>Myself and<br>education within my<br>children you would probably think well<br>surely educating children would be the<br>responsibility of schools and teachers<br>wouldn't you well of course they are<br>teachers are key to educating our<br>children<br>however are the school buildings and the<br>learning environment that teaches and<br>children in support the school pedagogy<br>teaching and<br>learning some teachers might think that<br>the learning environment is absolutely<br>the key to<br>realizing the education Vision as well<br>as their<br>pedagogy however some teachers might<br>might think that the learning<br>environment has very little significance<br>learning what you hear today are voices<br>the voices the real voices of school the<br>voices of<br>principls class teachers and<br>students these voices Express how school<br>buildings and their learning environment<br>support and respond to their learning<br>and<br>effectively their lives and the<br>community these voices educate me in how<br>to design schools<br>better<br>paper new buildings new designs don't<br>necessarily mean you get 21st century<br>education because you really have to<br>work with your staff and your teachers<br>they're more used to traditional type<br>things so we've tried to do a lot of<br>breaking out of those<br>aspects I would say the physical<br>organization of the school affects the<br>vision R it<br>okay I have to say that the organization<br>the school environment hasn't really<br>been a big factor in our thinking the<br>interior does work because it's all we<br>know education is generally made up of<br>19th century building 20th C Century<br>teachers and 21st century<br>children in our flexible learning spaces<br>you have to be a whole lot more<br>conscious of the fact that there are<br>other people sharing the space with you<br>pars are outdated they're not meeting<br>the learning and the teaching needs of<br>our young people and our<br>teachers two projectors in a space one<br>of which is in a presentation room that<br>you can actually close off but there's<br>also tables larger and smaller tables<br>because we are so transparent large<br>flexible spaces there is not a lot of<br>space to hang display material but the<br>advantage is that the teachers don't own<br>a space and not let anybody else come in<br>it groups of students<br>can work either independently with their<br>peers around or as a group and<br>collaborate on something interviewing<br>kids if we ask them what their perfect<br>classes they still have this concept in<br>their head that'll be everyone sitting<br>in rows teacher telling them what to do<br>on backing instruction and in this<br>fantasy of these they'll also respond<br>and do everything they're<br>asked that we've got technology where<br>students can access online resources and<br>that there are a bank of 10 computers<br>within our learning<br>Commons we get quite precious about our<br>teaching space we use phrases like this<br>is my room well it's not really I mean<br>it's the school's<br>room every session we not like if I go<br>to mass like on Tuesdays next Tuesday I<br>won't be like in the same exact same<br>pass in the same spot and everything<br>like move to a different area so I'll be<br>in always go back to a thing that we do<br>like when we go to the class we already<br>know where we're going to<br>start traditional schools often the<br>furniture is all set and set in out out<br>place the furniture could change on a<br>daily basis according to what the need<br>to<br>I don't think the school has any<br>cultural like aspects CU school is more<br>like it's like industrial technical<br>school cuz like more the design of the<br>school looks more industrial we do<br>school like events for like culturals<br>but that's not really the school<br>building reflecting on<br>it being C Al appropriate to me means<br>that you treat the person as being in<br>that culture then to try and build a<br>building that looks like their culture<br>and I don't feel that this country has<br>got that right<br>yet thinking that any students that come<br>from the other cultures needs to<br>understand and appreciate you know the<br>culture of New Zealand<br>so do you feel a sense of belonging when<br>you come to<br>school yeah<br>yeah of the places that I've ever been<br>like one the most accepting places<br>really comfortable yeah like I've never<br>I eat with my<br>hands right just me but it's not like I<br>wouldn't eat with my hands if I wanted<br>to it's not like anyone's talking me I<br>just choose not to<br>right how does it feel like to have this<br>it's from it's okay<br>for for the rest you kind of got the<br>like warer and<br>stuff the parents are very interested in<br>their students education a lot of them I<br>find will say well you're the expert you<br>know what you're doing we'll leave it to<br>you our teachers need to be aware that<br>the home environment of these young<br>people is different they're expected to<br>fulfill a whole lot of responsibilities<br>in the<br>home some of them are expected to care<br>for younger siblings do tours or go to<br>them parents think that their job from<br>is to get the kid to school and then<br>after that it's missed a job you know<br>and so therefore it's they don't tend to<br>question what we do either it's good and<br>bad and so therefore they're quite happy<br>to leave to leave the education and<br>responsibility they're not likely to ask<br>for clarification in the classroom if<br>they are not clear about<br>things when they go home there is no<br>quiet space for them to do their work um<br>we have a lot of kids who hang around<br>here after school and come to classes<br>and work because they know as soon as<br>they get home there's no choice more and<br>more of our successful students are<br>doing their work at 9 10 11 12 1 2 in<br>the morning when everyone's gone to bed<br>cuz that's when it's<br>Qui like in summer and breaks and stuff<br>it would be cool if you just go outside<br>and just like the grass and stuff but I<br>never had that kind of<br>opportunity but with the wireless we<br>also see kids who are you know who<br>sudden the car back by the library or<br>the sit outside because the wireless is<br>always open so okay they can sit around<br>the school and do work as<br>well what aspect of the school would you<br>remember and take with you when you<br>leave school and further your studies or<br>go to<br>work Freedom right we've got lots of<br>freedom and I guess the way like cuz<br>we're we're the first people to kind of<br>experience this kind of environment so<br>this whole thing the way they teach the<br>environment atmosphere cuz it's so<br>different two reasons why come to school<br>I but in school some of these children<br>coming to school is in achievement<br>considering what's going on in the home<br>the one thing that's constant in their<br>lives is school so we are kind of a safe<br>place for them you know because for<br>those kids the learning is the last<br>thing on them<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
