Arts)</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good<br>evening in case you're<br>wondering this person right here is this<br>person right here I'm a literary scholar<br>I'm doing my PhD in English here at the<br>University and when I tell people that<br>I'm doing a PhD in English I suspect<br>they've got a slightly different picture<br>in their minds than I have in my mind<br>it's a bit of an image problem we have<br>in the English Department uh I think<br>most of us see ourselves as these poetic<br>n creatures we we wander Barefoot<br>through the grass in the park and we<br>compose sonnets in our minds and we are<br>the keepers of the great secrets of the<br>human intricacies of the world and we<br>are quite proud of that the image that I<br>have in my mind when I think about what<br>I do looks a little bit like that<br>I quite like it it's quite<br>glamorous unfortunately it is not shared<br>outside my department when I tell people<br>a parties what I do I'm pretty sure they<br>see more like<br>this yeah not so<br>GL but it's not true anymore we have<br>modernized we don't sit under piles of<br>anchy TOS anymore we don't sit in stuffy<br>offices I've only fallen over in the<br>library like twice this year so that's<br>just not accurate anymore<br>and I want to give you a mental image of<br>the modern literary scholar<br>tonight next time someone says to you<br>that they are a literary scholar I want<br>you to see this next image and I want<br>you to picture them as a state ofth art<br>as a digital a 21st century creature I<br>want you to see something more like<br>this yes they have given us<br>computers we don't all know how to use<br>them some of us curse at them daily but<br>we are learning how to use them because<br>largely of the volume of digital texts<br>that are available online these days<br>things like Google Books and project<br>gber which I'll show you in a minute<br>give us a window into a new world of<br>digital and computational methodologies<br>that we just haven't had before so we're<br>playing a little bit of catch up I'm<br>going to walk you through a method that<br>I'm using at the moment um using<br>softwear to scan novels to look at how<br>they might be related to one<br>another so because my general research<br>topic is in genetics and fiction I'm<br>looking at how bioengineering characters<br>are represented in modern fiction I've<br>been doing a lot of reading on genetics<br>and reading a lot of articles in that<br>field and I came across one that does<br>this there's a team at UC Berkeley<br>who've developed software that compares<br>two genomes and these are genomes here<br>represented this text so you've got your<br>adamine your flaming your<br>so they're looking at these two<br>different genomes and they're using a<br>scanning software package it's a Unix<br>package it uses command line scripts if<br>you know what that means if you don'tget<br>to it um they compare these genomes and<br>they look for commonalities so if<br>they've programmed their software to<br>look for four character text strings<br>then the software will stand through<br>first four characters the second four<br>characters third four characters and so<br>on and when it sees the same characters<br>in two different genomes in that four<br>character string it will go fingo<br>TC<br>TC it will build those matches into a<br>profile that says based on X number of<br>matches between gen A and G B we think<br>that they might be X percentage related<br>and they end up with a philogenetic tree<br>so if you're a biologist and you know<br>what that looks like um you'll be<br>following me but if not it's a kind of<br>tells you how related different species<br>are and for instance you might see a<br>human on one of these Maps is 30%<br>related to a head of lettuce um Mak you<br>think about this<br>if but that's the kind of thing that it<br>builds so the people that developed the<br>software were quite clued on and they<br>realized that all they're doing here is<br>scanning text now it's not only Gom that<br>take the form of text and they were<br>quite F on to that as a kind of a test<br>of how well it would work they the<br>software to English novels and to<br>various other types of books and they<br>came up with this graph or this MTH that<br>shows you how different novels are<br>related to one another so because you're<br>looking at those character strings it's<br>picking up the types of strings or the<br>types of words that appear most commonly<br>in different books and it Maps the<br>vocabulary the linguistic and kind of<br>syntactic um traits of one book against<br>another so a couple of things come up<br>when you look at this you can see that<br>books by the same author like the atin<br>novels here tend to be related by a<br>branch and that's because both those<br>books will be subsets of Jane Austin's<br>vocabulary which will itself be a subset<br>of the vocabulary of um England at the<br>time she was<br>writing the other thing you can see is<br>that books in the same gen tend to be<br>quite heavily related so for the<br>religious texts here even though you<br>might think of those as being very<br>diverse in terms of what they're say<br>there syntactic St and their language<br>use is similar enough that their<br>relatedness comes up in this<br>map now if you're a bit of a book nerd<br>like me you look at<br>us interesting quite like it but it's<br>not really at this stage answering any<br>research questions so what I'm trying to<br>do is adapt the software so that I can<br>use it to answer specific questions that<br>come up in my<br>research that's all I've done so I<br>wanted to know for instance whether<br>there was a common lexicon common kind<br>of language and language use in novels<br>that are written about<br>orphans so I've gone through and<br>collected five texts about orph here and<br>as a control group I'm going to map<br>those on a tree against five orphans<br>that I'm not about<br>about so in order to control for um time<br>fluctuations as language changes over<br>time I've matched the dates as closely<br>as possible so that for every Oran<br>protagonist I've protagonist from the<br>same roughly decade or<br>two so I'm going to show you quickly how<br>I go about getting those texts into a<br>readable form for the software and then<br>another so first of all we've got to<br>actually get the no and make it readable<br>by software software does not read like<br>your eye and to be completely honest<br>when I get a text string that the<br>software will read it makes me want to<br>throw myself out a window cuz it looks<br>so horrible but basically what we're<br>going to do is get a digital copy of the<br>text first and to do that I've got a<br>Project Gutenberg which has if you<br>haven't been there it's got 4,000 free<br>digital texts that you can download that<br>you can use for your research purposes<br>that you can read online it's<br>impressive so I'm searching here for a<br>novel called Tom Jones this is not the<br>you know shaking singer but it's a 1700<br>novel by Henry field and I'm going to<br>copy that whole novel and dump the<br>entire text of it into a word<br>once I've got it in my word document I<br>can play around with it a little bit I<br>can get rid of some of the formatting<br>that would confuse the software I can<br>get rid of project bir's text and I can<br>get rid of a lot of the characters that<br>aren't really textual information so<br>things like punctuation marks um<br>spaces um any kind of information that<br>is not a text character is going to be<br>got rid<br>of looks like our video freezing up a<br>little bit but I'll show you what it<br>looks like once you get the finished<br>product that is my text string believe<br>it or not this one is actually<br>Frankenstein if you've ever read<br>Frankenstein in a book it's in the form<br>of letters uh this does not look like<br>it next thing to do is to take all these<br>digitized Texs that are now in the form<br>of um genomic like strings and to<br>actually run them through the software<br>so that I get<br>a but this is UNIX software meaning this<br>took me many months by the way I have to<br>figure out how to use this horrible<br>thing we call the terminal the name kind<br>of describes<br>how and in the terminal I'm entering um<br>commands that will call upon the<br>software I've installed and kind of tell<br>her what to do so for a text analysis<br>I'm not sure of you have there but I'm<br>telling it if ifp text I want to feature<br>frequency profile of text document I'm<br>telling it all the documents that I want<br>it to scan and then I'm telling it what<br>kind of format I want it to end up<br>in what it looks like in the end is<br>this so I've got in green here all the<br>texts that have protagonists<br>expectations J twist Frankenstein and<br>tomon and I've matched them against the<br>the scarlet and Jack sheer and I want to<br>see now whether there are any<br>significant relationships between those<br>texts so what I was kind of hoping for<br>which hasn't really happened is that the<br>orphan texts would be clustered off on<br>one side and they would have a lot of<br>shared branches and the non orphan text<br>would be clustered off on the other side<br>hasn't so much happened but we do have a<br>couple of shared<br>branches we've got a sh Branch for<br>inst in Tom Jones<br>now those novels are not a lot alike and<br>half the pleasure of this kind of<br>analysis is that throws up commonalities<br>that you would never ever have Pi if you<br>read the books so this would be a<br>research lead that I can go and follow<br>up if I want to but because I'm<br>interested in other things at the moment<br>I'm going to focus on this little sh<br>here Oliver Twist and Jack she are two<br>novels that were both first<br>serialized and I wouldn't have thought<br>that they were that closely related<br>but if I dig in a little bit deeper I<br>found out after following this lead<br>right here that they were both<br>serialized in the same periodical when<br>they were first released and that the<br>editor of that periodical was the guy<br>who wrote<br>this Charles Dickens has written his own<br>novel and then it's possible looking at<br>the similarity that comes up in this<br>analysis that he's also edited the other<br>novel he was in charge of serializing<br>and that his vocabulary and his<br>experience with the T<br>has come to play on both those novels<br>the one he wrote and the one he edited<br>that's just a possibility and I can't<br>conclude anything from this but what I<br>can do is follow a lead so this is<br>giving me that little inking of an idea<br>that I can follow up through my close<br>Brea now if this is all excited you and<br>you want to try some of this yourself um<br>Google has a product that you can use to<br>do your own analysis it's called the INR<br>Vier and it draws on 5.2 million texts<br>in Google Books<br>database so what you can do here is<br>enter any keyword that you're interested<br>in and it will spit out a graph showing<br>that word's frequency in all the books<br>and its database and it'll give you a<br>time series so we can see for instance<br>the frequency of our word parent in 1800<br>right up to 2000 and I'm trying a few<br>different words here so I've<br>and we can see that the frequency of<br>that word has kind of dropped off a<br>little bit<br>since<br>193 so this is another lead for me to<br>follow up I can then look at books<br>around that era and see is there a<br>changing attitude to the father are we<br>losing interest inity or have we just<br>changed the language we're using if you<br>look at the term dead there's a huge<br>exponential increase in it usage so is<br>it possible that we're casual our<br>understanding of what it means to be a<br>father<br>so this just gives you a bit of an<br>inkling of some of the new methodologies<br>that are coming out in English<br>departments and I really hope that next<br>time someone at a party tells you<br>they're an English major you see<br>something more along the lines of this<br>than the stuffy old guy in</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
