Antilles.<br>School of Environment (Faculty of Science)</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so before I begin this program I'm going<br>to just give you a brief introduction to<br>my research I study andm on island<br>called I specifically look at the<br>chemical evolution of the Ning of the Sy<br>I over time now when you speak to a<br>geologist and they say that they love<br>rocks it's kind of strange people who<br>don't know about rocks um but the truth<br>is is when you break a rock down it's<br>made up of a variety of different<br>minerals and what I look at is the<br>chemistry of those different minerals<br>and how they compare across different<br>Volcan now this can be quite complicated<br>for people to understand um but it's<br>actually really simple so what I've done<br>is into a metaphor where these minerals<br>that are in my um whose chemical<br>got um are pirate ships on the mag SE so<br>I hope you enjoy too fun um certainly<br>should be here we<br>go deep in the heart of the Caribbean<br>Sea lies an island shrouded in mystery<br>one of 11 Dominica is still unique she<br>has her own story of which we shall<br>speak the story is one retold through<br>the<br>ages of pirates and prisoners and<br>Volcanic rages alone on her surface the<br>Rocks sit and wait for geologists to<br>come and tell their F these rocks hold<br>the record of the Pirates washed ashore<br>by the for of eruptions whose other<br>evidence is no more locked in these<br>rocks pirate minerals be and lock in his<br>minerals is the story you'll see now<br>many of these Pirates don't quite belong<br>they've been picked up and carried by a<br>waves quite strong this happens sometime<br>on the anic sea where Pirates are thrown<br>at or picked up for free which St to<br>believe is a question to ask sorting it<br>out is the je task and so ladies and<br>gentlemen without further Ado here is<br>the story of the PIR minerals that sail<br>blue Our Story begins deep deep<br>underground at the Port where our<br>Pirates crew can be found it is here in<br>this place that elements Ro free looking<br>Sailors on the magmatic seam with the<br>crew that they need our minerals he away<br>they are ready for the journey and shall<br>not<br>delay the first ship to leave port and<br>the<br>D only Sil magnesium or iron will do all<br>of the are called and their present not<br>for they require quite specific<br>conditions to float they can't travel<br>far unless they do so with speed but<br>they come under attack should the<br>temperature rece their presence just one<br>mixing the ship to for are<br>fin they're often not special unless<br>they've been m in our case these ships<br>are an anomalous clue but they for the<br>same for survive every Russian like new<br>theist group suggest something strange<br>range the next ship in our party is a<br>second ortha she's named and this one's<br>not green in a s volcano her story is<br>quite boring she changes nothing when<br>she St to her<br>boring with the others and they'll see a<br>big change when present in different<br>centers or the has quite a range it<br>appears that this mineral is one of the<br>few that GRE with Magma and has always<br>been<br>true now D place is the last for and she<br>is a ship with many cour although silia<br>and alumina are her main crew we study<br>sodi sodium and potassium too The Rao of<br>these Sailors tells quite a tale they<br>keep excellent records of every<br>in most rocks this ratio would highly<br>variable be but in our rocks again<br>things are strange as you'll see when I<br>speak of PL place I actually mean<br>three three different ships of this<br>Crystal exist in every eruption not even<br>one Mist one one and<br>one and equilibrium from which we can<br>believe that two separate magn have been<br>on the SC<br>now fry face is quite a devious girl<br>she'll show you around around to the<br>your world to look from her evidence of<br>this mixing we must turn to other Pires<br>we know we can trust the best evidence<br>of mixing in temperature lies but<br>different Pirates tell different stories<br>surprise let's start with the simplest P<br>BYO and this the themometer takes n<br>andet as a p iron oxide their call but<br>they contain Titanium 2 you can tell<br>equilibrium by their main of FR their<br>story is simple it's one of prisoner<br>exchange magne SP iron that's how it's<br>arranged these Pirates are honest there<br>is no disgrace the story tells only of<br>now black car horn has a story to tell<br>of temperatures lower from the oxide<br>cell a s she is with a shiny exterior<br>recording both temperature and pressure<br>she think she<br>Superior toit temperature IND keeps<br>track compliments oful and love share M<br>these temperatures are lower than we<br>thought they would be but they're flated<br>with only as though she was free in the<br>antic ocean this is never really true<br>for horn enters later than all others<br>un<br>when<br>place there's an exchange of caps and<br>holling and blundy keep track of those<br>expells their records indicate<br>temperatures higher than before which<br>means we now have three temperatures to<br>which<br>and so dear audience it is now time to<br>review the completed story that we<br>true from P we know that through one<br>large chamber to all eruptions go and<br>next from or here we see that for each<br>volcano a separate chamber there must be<br>now ol of tells us that some mixing did<br>occur at the and extent are still a bit<br>of a blur from magnetite illite and an 2<br>we a picture of temperatures present<br>before the volcanoes blew from all this<br>we can Garner that our system is quite<br>complex much more work must be done to<br>show however if our model is<br>correct and so ladies and gentlemen the<br>story is no more the Rocks told us much<br>of those pirates wash the shore with h<br>ships and halfs and S the Lord</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
