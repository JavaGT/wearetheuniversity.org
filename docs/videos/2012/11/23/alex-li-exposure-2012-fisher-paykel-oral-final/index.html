Education)</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Kula my name is Alex and my doctoral<br>research project is on young Chinese<br>diaspora's experience of sexuality<br>education in New<br>Zealand now one good thing about this<br>project is um it's always a very good<br>conversation St you get a few raised<br>eyebrows when the word sexuality<br>mentioned and people would often ask me<br>why what makes you choose this<br>topic it's actually a very good question<br>so over time I realized my personal<br>background does inform my interest in<br>the topic and the kind of Investigation<br>I want to engage with so I arrived in<br>New Zealand more than 10 years ago as an<br>international student became a new<br>Chinese migrant four years ago and did<br>my masters in feminist psychology last<br>year so As I Grew increasingly aware of<br>my own identity as a Chinese woman<br>overseas I finally start to understand<br>the famous feminist slogan the personal<br>is political so given my position in<br>this research I'm able to offer some<br>reflexive critique of existing research<br>on the topic and I noticed<br>that<br>oops oops have I been pressing it yeah I<br>noticed that the ways Chinese um young<br>people's sexuality is is represented in<br>existing research is very polarized like<br>the P pictures you have here you have<br>the hardworking almost nerd looking<br>Chinese students featuring many<br>University websites including our<br>University website and you have the uh<br>sexual um exotic sexual bombshell that<br>you see on websites like find your<br>Chinese wife or SE Asian Asian<br>beauty.com so these um representations<br>they really come on to one seemingly<br>self-contradictory profile that Chinese<br>young people are sexually conservative<br>and simultaneously sexually Reckless so<br>together these two facets work to exal<br>defy Chinese young people as a a group<br>other to the ethnic majority in a given<br>Society in terms of sexuality so is this<br>profile really representative of Chinese<br>people's um sexuality and what is<br>underlying such<br>assumptions we look at these two<br>separates uh these two facets separately<br>according to research Chinese young<br>people are more conservative compared to<br>their white counterparts in these many<br>ways they're um generally less sexually<br>knowledgeable or experienced having more<br>conservative attitudes um experiencing<br>higher rates of anxiety from anticipated<br>sexual activities um this idea may be<br>linked to a perception of Chinese young<br>people people as ideal pupils highly<br>invested in academic Pursuits to the<br>point of being asexual um so there is<br>strong emphasis on education across<br>Chinese cultures so young people's<br>sexual or romantic relationships are<br>often deemed as interference to their<br>study by the parents so young people may<br>be under more supervision and may<br>exercise maybe less likely to be able to<br>exess their sexual autonomy<br>but what is wrong with this<br>representation firstly a major<br>limitation with comparative research is<br>is um it relies on imposing um Western<br>paradigms on ethnic minority groups by<br>assuming Western values and practices as<br>the standard and a lot of studies use<br>constructs or uh measures that are not<br>necessarily culturally Universal<br>therefore psychometrically<br>problematic secondly there is a<br>disparity between between chinese's<br>sexual um practice in private and public<br>expression of sexuality due to cultural<br>norms that decree against open<br>discussion of sexuality so the<br>conservatism we uh reported that we see<br>in research may actually be over<br>represented lastly Chinese dipor<br>sexuality is intersected with the<br>process of a<br>culturation some Chinese women um in<br>over overseas countries report rep<br>shifts in their gender role attitudes as<br>well as sexual practice uh in po<br>immigrant lives that very uh very much<br>diverge from<br>conservatism the other side of this<br>profile is sexual<br>recklessness um this often implied in<br>research driven by public health agenda<br>that focuses on negative outcomes of<br>young people's sexual<br>activeness so in New Zealand um Chinese<br>International students and uh recent<br>immigrants are seen as particularly<br>problematic groups in terms of sexual<br>health as abortion rates among these<br>groups have received a lot of media<br>attention in the last<br>decade so these young people are seen<br>believed to be lonely isolated<br>impressionable without Family Support<br>perm miscues and um ignorant about<br>sexuality so my critique about of this<br>representation firstly mainstream psych<br>um mainstream scholarship adopts a<br>eurocentric framework which tends to<br>accentuate um nonwestern groups<br>differences as the other such as the<br>construction of young people's sexual<br>activeness as<br>promiscuous also research assumes a<br>direct link between young people's<br>acquisition of sexual knowledge and<br>their safer sexual practice so it<br>follows that without proper knowledge<br>young people say sexual activeness is<br>deemed Reckless of course this<br>assumption is problematic as identified<br>by a knowledge practice Gap um observed<br>in sex education research<br>worldwide lastly sexual health research<br>in New Zealand is very much informed by<br>neoliberalism that um focuses on<br>individualized health rhetoric so it<br>it's basically saying you reap what you<br>sell vulnerable groups and individual<br>IND uh risk individual ual they are<br>vulnerable uh they responsib sorry<br>they're responsible for their own<br>vulnerability as consequences of their<br>Reckless<br>actions so together these two facets<br>compose a profile of an an exotic other<br>um Chinese sexuality in particular<br>Chinese femininity is often<br>problematized for being either um overly<br>passive or excessively wild now um<br>such constructions of sexuality are very<br>restrictive and limiting and operate as<br>oppressive<br>discourses it can be also detrimental to<br>young women's sexual health because<br>caught in the bind between<br>hypersexualization by racial<br>stereotyping and traditional cultural<br>messages demanding them to downplay<br>their sexuality chines young women they<br>they may struggle with developing<br>comfort with their sexual sexuality and<br>sexual expression and Research indicates<br>that sexual autonomy and efficacy plays<br>a crucial role in young women's<br>assertiveness in Intimate situations<br>therefore their sexual safety<br>additionally this exal defying tendency<br>in research assumptions May imped us<br>from developing a more nuanced and<br>comprehensive understanding of Chinese<br>young people's sexuality such as how<br>they conform to and resist dominant<br>discourses<br>how they make sense of their own sexual<br>practices healthy or risky or<br>otherwise and that is where I hope my re<br>my research would come in so I argue<br>that typing into young people's sexual<br>uh subjectivity open up critical ways of<br>representing their sexuality that are<br>alternative to the homogenizing<br>presumptions I mentioned earlier and<br>will review important implications of<br>their sexual health for for researchers<br>as well as in<br>Educators so that's my central research<br>question how do Chinese young people<br>become sexual subjects as diasporas in<br>New Zealand the research sample is<br>defined as ethnic Chinese of 18 to 25<br>from M China Hong Kong and Taiwan or<br>young people with parents born in these<br>places it's including both International<br>students and immigrant<br>youth this ecological model gives an<br>outline of the dimensions<br>involved in uh sexuality education so<br>different from sex education sexuality<br>education has a more holistic approach<br>um and it could occur in classrooms um<br>or elsewhere officially or unofficially<br>so young people's experience of it is<br>subject to influences from these<br>multiple levels and more importantly I<br>emphasize the individual level and I<br>want to find out how individual agency<br>operates in young people's negotiation<br>of these social uh<br>processes so this means I need a<br>theoretical position that allows me to<br>see sexuality as constituted by its<br>simultaneously simultaneously<br>acknowledges these young peoples um as<br>active subjects with agency to rework<br>and resist the power enacted in in um<br>social<br>institutions so as my research will be<br>uh informed by feminist<br>poststructuralism and Fuko and bat's<br>idea of<br>power so thank you thank you for</p></main><footer
