automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Namaste and a very warm good evening to<br>all of you my name is giri Raj sing<br>shakawat and the topic of my<br>presentation is transcranial direct<br>current stimulation intensity and<br>duration effects on th<br>suppression this slide pretty much<br>summarizes my entire PhD project I'm<br>using a combination of hearing aids and<br>transcranial direct current stimulation<br>for ten suppression however in my<br>today's talk I'll Focus about my pilot<br>study which was done to optimize the<br>parameters of transcranial direct<br>current stimulation for tinitus<br>suppression so what exactly is tinitus<br>tinitus is defined as auditory Phantom<br>perception of sound it's the constant<br>annoying ringing buzzing hissing sound<br>Source that's how it sounds like now can<br>you all imagine if you have to live with<br>this sound 24/7 in your head what would<br>be your<br>condition yes tenis can lead to anger<br>frustration poor communication lack of<br>sleep and on the whole the person gets<br>trapped in the Vicious Cycle between<br>constant state of anxiety and attention<br>towards tenus tenus can have detrimental<br>impact on the overall quality of life of<br>the sufferer and on extreme cases it can<br>also lead to Suicidal<br>Tendencies now these are some of the<br>famous people who suffer from tinitus<br>and what I want now is I want you all at<br>least to guess one or two names in the<br>picture can you say some<br>names there you go and well done yeah<br>these are just few of the people now as<br>far as the prevalence is concerned in<br>United States there are 50 million<br>people who suffer from some form of<br>tenus as far as New Zealand is concerned<br>approximately 15 to 20% of general<br>population suffers from tenus which<br>would be around<br>400,000 people and one in 10 sufferers<br>finds it really<br>catastrophic and here comes the most<br>unfortunate part majority of the times<br>when these ten sufferers try to reach<br>out for profession Health globally the<br>most common response which they get from<br>professionals is well there's nothing<br>much which can be done for your<br>condition you may have to learn to live<br>with it and I hope with advancement of<br>new technology and new techniques coming<br>in this trend should change and one such<br>technique which might be instrumental in<br>bringing in bringing this kind of change<br>could be trans cranial direct current<br>stimulation or<br>tdcs what happens in tdcs is we use<br>rubber electrodes which are then encased<br>in sponges and then placed on the target<br>area of the head we use these straps to<br>ensure that the electrode stays at the<br>right place and then with the help of<br>these wires we connect these electrodes<br>to this little device here which<br>delivers mild electric current to the<br>person's head now this is nothing like<br>electrocuting someone it's totally<br>non-invasive painless simple and most<br>importantly a safe<br>technique as far as the research in the<br>area of tinitus and tdcs is concerned<br>it's still in its infancy there are only<br>10 published studies done so far the<br>first published study came in the year<br>2006 and the latest one is my study<br>which recently got published and if you<br>look at all these 10 studies they have<br>used very different parameters about ten<br>suppression so basically there's no<br>uniformity about which setting works the<br>best for ten suppression and that was<br>the main reason of carrying out my pilot<br>study which is one of its<br>first So based on this review I had to<br>take four very important decisions for<br>my study the first one was what should<br>be the polarity of tdcs now based on<br>polarity tdcs can be anodal or cathodal<br>in anodal tdcs it increases the<br>excitability of underline cortex by<br>neuronal<br>depolarization and unanimously all the<br>Studies have shown that that it's the<br>anodal tdcs which leads to tinal<br>suppression as compared to cathodal or<br>sham so it was pretty much simple and<br>straightforward that I'll be using anal<br>tdcs for my study but as far as the<br>intensity and duration were concerned<br>there was lot of different values people<br>have used so there was no uniformity So<br>based on the literature I decided to use<br>1 milliamp and 2 millium current<br>intensities each for 10 15 and 20<br>minutes so in the total I had six<br>different settings to try and study<br>their impact contal suppression and here<br>comes the most puzzling question in what<br>should be the site of stimulation now<br>based on this aspect the existing<br>literature can be divided into two<br>groups certain people have used LTA or<br>the left temporal parietal area others<br>have used dorsolateral prefrontal cortex<br>with varied amount of success and I was<br>a bit confused that what should I do at<br>that moment you know so I want to thank<br>Pia and his colleagues for carrying out<br>this beautiful study where they studied<br>12 different head locations and the<br>impact of stimulating those location on<br>tinal suppression and it was the LTA<br>which emerged as a winning setting and I<br>thought okay fine I'll be using LTA for<br>my<br>study so the main objective of my study<br>was to find the interaction between<br>intensity and duration for tenus Relief<br>and as I mentioned before there were<br>total six different settings to try and<br>study their impact on tenor<br>suppression methods my study was<br>approved by univers University of<br>auckland's human participants ethical<br>committee there were total 25<br>participant with a mean age of 54 years<br>and the age range was from 28 years to<br>78 years um all the participant had a<br>minimum score of 25 on tenus functional<br>index now tenus functional index is a<br>standard questionnaire which we use for<br>assessment of clients with Tenors and a<br>minimum score of 25 indicates problem is<br>moderate and it needs some<br>intervention for safety reason all the<br>participant had to fill a neurological<br>checklist which was then screened by a<br>neurologist and only those participants<br>which were approved by the neurologist<br>were included in my study and the<br>evaluation tools which I used in my<br>study were clinical Global Improvement<br>scale and visual analog scale for tenus<br>loudness coming to the results now<br>before you look at this slide let me<br>explain what transient tenus suppression<br>means now it's defined as a minimum one<br>point reduction in tenus loudness as<br>measure measured on the visual analog<br>scale for tenus loudness this was the<br>standard definition used by majority of<br>other researchers working in this area<br>so I also use the same definition now if<br>you look at this graph here the x-axis<br>represents the point change in tetus<br>loudness and Y AIS represents the total<br>number of participants for some<br>technical reason I think it's it's not<br>coming here so on the whole there were<br>total 14 participants who experienced<br>transient in suppression and 11<br>participant didn't experience any change<br>change immediately after the<br>simulation as far as the overnight<br>changes were concerned there were 11<br>participant who experienced Improvement<br>four experienced worsening and 10<br>participant didn't experience any change<br>the important thing to note here is all<br>these participants who experience<br>Improvement or worsening they revert<br>back to their original symptoms after 24<br>hours which basically means that the<br>impact was transient it wasn't<br>longlasting<br>the x-axis here represents the duration<br>the y- AIS represents meitus loudness<br>change and the intensity is shown here<br>the 1 millium is the cross 2 millium is<br>circles and if you look at this little<br>Aster here the pink one it was the 2<br>millium current intensity and 20 minutes<br>duration which lead to statistically<br>significant suppression of tinitus as<br>results okay the slide is missing for<br>some reason similar results were seen<br>even for the mean clinical Global<br>Improvement scale as<br>well now here those par Sprint who<br>experience overnight Improvement of ten<br>symptoms are shown in the circles those<br>who didn't experience any change or<br>experience worsening are shown in the<br>crosses so this slide basically shows<br>that there was a marginal interaction<br>between overnight Improvement of tenor<br>symptoms and duration and similar kind<br>of marginal interaction was seen with<br>intensity as well which basically<br>basically means that those participants<br>who tend to respond positively<br>immediately after the simulation were<br>the ones who tend to experience<br>overnight Improvement as well so based<br>on these results it's safe to say that<br>tdcs can be a potential tool for clients<br>with tors and it was the 2 millium<br>current intensity and 20 minutes<br>duration which was the winning<br>setting coming to the limitations the<br>wash out period between my stimulation<br>sessions were 10 minute which may not be<br>sufficient enough to totally rule out<br>the cumulative impact of the overall<br>stimulation session and this study<br>wasn't a sham control design having said<br>that we should remember the fact that<br>the main objective of this study was to<br>find a dose response relationship that<br>what happens when we vary intensity and<br>duration on tin symptoms and now I have<br>the results with me and I'm already in<br>the middle of a main clinical trial<br>which is double blind sham control with<br>much longer wash out period and<br>long-term follow-ups and to be very<br>precise by the end of this month I<br>should have the data of the entire study<br>with me and hopefully I should be able<br>to share some groundbreaking results<br>with you all so I want to thank my<br>supervisors Dr Grant searchfield Dr<br>Kathy stinner and Josh up there thank<br>you so much for all the technical help</p></main><footer
