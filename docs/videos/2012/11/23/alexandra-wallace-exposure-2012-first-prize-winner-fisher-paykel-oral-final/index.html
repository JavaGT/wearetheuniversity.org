my name is Alex<br>Wallace and I'm a pediatrician currently<br>undertaking a PhD at The ligin Institute<br>I'm very pleased to talk to you today<br>about the fetal anemia study a project<br>we've undertaken to investigate the<br>influence of fetal anemia<br>on cardiovascular health and later<br>life to begin I'd like to tell you a<br>story about a remarkable New Zealander<br>by the name of William<br>ly I suspect few of you have heard of ly<br>however in the early 1960s while working<br>at National Women's Hospital here in<br>Oakland ly made a revolutionary medical<br>breakthrough when he pioneered the<br>technique of intrauterine blood<br>transfusion for fetuses afflicted by<br>Reese's hemolytic disease<br>in so doing ly became the very first<br>person in the world to deliver treatment<br>specifically to an unborn baby an<br>achievement that led him to become known<br>as the father of perinatal<br>medicine ly's technique soon became the<br>accepted standard of care for fetuses<br>with severe rees's disease saving the<br>lives of thousands of babies throughout<br>the<br>world so what is reesus hemolytic<br>disease well rees's disease occurred is<br>when a reesus negative mother develops<br>antibodies against the red blood cells<br>of her rees's positive<br>fetus her first baby is usually not<br>affected however in subsequent<br>pregnancies these antibodies can cross<br>the placenta and destroy the red blood<br>cells of her fetus this can make her<br>fetus severely anemic meaning that the<br>red blood cell count drops to<br>dangerously low levels in the 1940s and<br>50s rees's disease was an enor enormous<br>problem 50% of affected babies died<br>either before birth or soon after and<br>10% of all neonatal deaths were due to<br>rees's disease no treatment was<br>available prior to<br>birth however thanks to LY a new era of<br>reesus disease emerged in the<br>1960s with intrauterine blood<br>transfusion fetal anemia was treatable<br>and severely affected babies could be<br>kept alive in the womb long enough to<br>achieve a viable gestational age<br>concomitant improvements in both<br>obstetric and neonatal practice<br>contributed to the reduction in<br>mortality from rees's<br>disease the culmination of these<br>advances was the generation of a cohort<br>of babies who were the survivors of<br>severe reesus disease but what the<br>difficulties these babies had<br>experienced in their stormy start to<br>life have any influence on their health<br>as<br>adults which brings us to the top topic<br>of the developmental origins of adult<br>Disease an association between an<br>adverse intrauterine environment and<br>chronic disease was first proposed in<br>the 1980s by David Barker following<br>extensive epidemiological studies a<br>plethora of literature now exists to<br>support the fact that the intrauterine<br>environment plays an important role in<br>determining the risk of disease in later<br>life especially cardiovascular<br>disease most work to date has focused on<br>the role of unfavorable fetal nutrition<br>but could fetal anemia also influence<br>cardiovascular health in later<br>life so what do we already know about<br>the effect of fetal<br>anemia well we know that it is a complex<br>physiological stress or which reduces<br>oxygen supply to the fetus and causes<br>changes to Regional blood flow which are<br>most marked in the coronary blood<br>vessels the arteries which Supply blood<br>to the heart muscle in fact a six-fold<br>increase in coronary blood flow has been<br>shown to occur in anemic fetal sheep<br>compared to at most a two-fold increase<br>in blood flow to other parts of the body<br>this suggests that the coronary<br>circulation is more susceptible to the<br>effects of fetal<br>anemia very importantly changes to the<br>coronary blood vessels have also been<br>found in adult sheep who were exposed to<br>anemia prior to<br>birth whether similar changes occur in<br>hum who were anemic before birth is not<br>known thus the aim of the study is to<br>compare the health of adults who<br>suffered fetal anemia with an with that<br>of an unaffected sibling with respect to<br>cardiac function coronary blood flow and<br>cardiovascular risk<br>factors the so-called affected<br>participants in this study were<br>therefore adults who suffered fetal<br>anemia due to reesus disease and<br>received intrauterine blood transfusion<br>at National Women's Hospital between<br>1963 and 1992 and the affect the<br>unaffected uh group were siblings of the<br>affected<br>participants our recruitment Target was<br>80 sibling pairs cardiac function was<br>assessed using cardiac MRI scans<br>cardiovascular risk factors heart rate<br>variability and basic hematological and<br>biochemical parameters were also<br>assessed in total 473 fetuses received<br>intrauterine transfusion within the<br>prescribed time frame<br>of these 242 survived the perinatal<br>period and 228 were believed to be alive<br>at the time of the<br>study we successfully traced and<br>contacted nearly 90% of these<br>individuals 36 were unable to<br>participate and a further 56 had no<br>unaffected<br>sibling 95 of the remaining 107 agreed<br>to participate resulting in followup of<br>89% of potential index cases investig<br>ation are now complete on all 95<br>affected participants plus 92 unaffected<br>siblings equating to 88 sibling groups<br>and thus exceeding our original<br>recruitment<br>Target so what did we find well in terms<br>of Baseline characteristics there were<br>no differences between groups for sex<br>distribution however as rees's diseases<br>uncommon in the firstborn in a family<br>unaffected participants were older than<br>their affected siblings in addition<br>affected participants were born at an<br>earlier gestation and of lower birth<br>weight due to their difficulties in<br>utero in the graphs that follow affected<br>participants are represented by the red<br>columns and unaffected siblings by the<br>green<br>columns volumes for the main pumping<br>chamber of the heart the left ventricle<br>are presented here and these really are<br>very interesting findings as you can see<br>all three of the main measures of heart<br>volume are decreased in affected<br>participants these findings suggest that<br>affected participants also have reduced<br>cardiac output the amount of blood<br>pumped out by the heart every<br>minute affected participants also had a<br>trend towards reduced left ventricular<br>mass index which is a measure of heart<br>mass normalized for body<br>size with regard to cardiovascular risk<br>factors effective participants had an 8%<br>reduction in the concent ation of high<br>density lipoprotein the so-call good<br>cholesterol which helps to protect<br>against the development of<br>cardiovascular<br>disease we also assessed heart rate<br>variability which is a non-invasive<br>measure of the neurological control of<br>the heart the increase in the LF or low<br>frequency to HF high frequency ratio<br>found in affected participants indicates<br>increased sympathetic nervous system<br>activity which is in turn suggestive of<br>increased cardiovascular<br>risk we found no differences between the<br>groups for any other cardiovascular risk<br>factors or outcomes although as yet we<br>have no data for coronary<br>flow these findings are expected by the<br>end of this year and are eagerly awaited<br>given that the available animal data<br>indicates that this is where significant<br>differences between groups May<br>lie so what can we infer from this work<br>well these findings suggest to us that<br>heart growth is impaired by fetal anemia<br>resulting in smaller cardiac Chambers in<br>adulthood a relatively smaller heart<br>implies a reduction in cardiac cell<br>number and therefore greater work per<br>unit of heart muscle which may well be a<br>disadvantage particularly under<br>conditions of<br>stress in addition decreased high<br>density lipoprotein and increased<br>sympathetic activity also imply<br>increased cardiovascular risk<br>to conclude these exciting findings<br>provide us with the very first evidence<br>in humans that fetal anemia may have<br>deleterious cardiovascular consequences<br>in<br>adulthood asra's disease is now largely<br>preventable the question that follows<br>from this work is whether there are<br>cardiovascular consequences for adults<br>who were born early and exposed to<br>anemia while still pre-term a question<br>we are currently investigating with a<br>study in pre-term<br>sheep taken together the findings of<br>both these studies will not only have<br>implications for the adult survivors of<br>fetal anemia but may also influence<br>transfusion thresholds for both the<br>fetus and the preter<br>neonate it is outstanding that here at<br>the University of Oakland we've had the<br>opportunity to continue ly's Legacy with<br>this work if he was alive today I know<br>he would be excited by this new<br>knowledge and the impact it may have on<br>the health of future<br>Generations I'd just like to acknowledge<br>all the participants of this study who<br>were so enthusiastic about taking part<br>um and without whom clearly we could not<br>have done this work I'd also like to<br>acknowledge my fantastic supervisors<br>Jane Harding and Stuart delil our<br>collaborator in the stats Kemp thornberg<br>and our funders the health research<br>Council and the lottery Grant board<br>thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
