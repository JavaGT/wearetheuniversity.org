A CASE OF 'GREEN' BUILDINGS.<br>ARCHITECTURE (NICAI)</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi everyone good evening my name is a<br>on or you can call me<br>easy uh I'm studying um PhD in<br>architecture Department of architecture<br>nikai and my supervisor is Hubert and my<br>topic ask a simple question can<br>architecture improve productivity now<br>despite the fact that this question is<br>quite easy I would like us just hold on<br>case Okay the Green Building movement<br>which is actually what initiated green<br>buildings we have this um today started<br>in 1990s as a response to the<br>sustainability Crusade that came up and<br>then it was more of a moral imperative<br>no one was forced to have green<br>buildings and there was no legal<br>obligations to it as such the number of<br>green buildings we had were quite<br>minimal in the year 2000 um there came<br>up a new research that actually went a<br>step further by stating that if you have<br>a green building your occupants are<br>going to be very much<br>productive now at the heart of every<br>business is Success every businessman<br>wants to make wants to make success and<br>at the center of all business activities<br>is the human element which is the worker<br>or the occupant in this<br>case now for for so many years um<br>business owners have tried to see how<br>they can measure how productive the<br>people they are paying uh and if<br>possible increase this productivity as<br>such when the Green Building system came<br>up and said that if you have a green<br>building your your occupant is going to<br>be productive that seems so much like a<br>viable um Venture for them and they say<br>this in simple thms The Greener your<br>building is the more productive your<br>occupants are the more productive your<br>occupants are the more money you<br>make now the Green Building system<br>initiated the Green Building the green<br>rating tools now these tools actually um<br>specified an optimal um indoor<br>environment quality at which it's<br>presumed that occupants be most<br>productive if you achieve this um levels<br>of temperature and lighting your<br>occupants will work better and make more<br>money for you and um this was actually<br>um evaluated all studies studied and<br>they found out that more people there<br>were there was less absenteeism in<br>offices people were more productive and<br>if you actually put them through test<br>they will perform better but then when<br>you look into this research you find<br>that there's no there's actually no<br>substantial proof as such my research<br>asks these questions what actually makes<br>us<br>productive secondly really does where I<br>am actually affect the way I work and<br>thirdly the way we we have been<br>measuring productivity all these years<br>my research wants to make this very<br>controversial statements the first is<br>there is no correlation between the<br>indoor environment quality of an office<br>and my productivity the second one is<br>the optimal indoor environment quality<br>specified by this green rating tools<br>does not represent how I feel about my<br>about my environment and thirdly<br>productivity cannot be adequately<br>measured in an office<br>my research will focus on the Indo<br>environment quality of green buildings<br>and how they affect the productivity of<br>an occupant and I I'm I'm going through<br>this um through reviewing past studies<br>that have been done in UK us and all<br>over the world and also engage myself in<br>my own personal in my own um empirical<br>study to know if this is actually<br>true the first review I did which was<br>most important one is to look at our<br>green style rating to which is the<br>GreenStar andz office and they have<br>managed to follow um the UK and the US<br>system by specifying that if you have a<br>2.5 daylight factor in your office the<br>occupants are going to be more<br>productive now this is the minimum<br>daylighting that is expected and office<br>you have as you can see all over New<br>Zealand there are more glazing in our<br>buildings and you know what glazing<br>brings about clay it brings about so<br>many other<br>things secondly it states that we need<br>400 lots of light on a walking plane for<br>me to be able to see and walk but then a<br>very recent research has shown that we<br>don't need this amount of lighting to<br>see and work 100 LS of light is enough<br>and again what is being measured is<br>Lighting on a plane on a work plane but<br>the human eyes does not see light on a<br>plane we see light is reflected from all<br>four corners of the environment we're<br>working in thirdly it say that at some<br>particular temperature levels that um<br>occupants will work better you find out<br>that um if you go deeper into the rating<br>tool the temperature the temperature<br>range that is given for air conditioned<br>buildings is quite narrow and that given<br>for naturally ventilated buildings are<br>quite um wide as such if I am a designer<br>it would be easier for me to install an<br>air conditioner to achieve this if you<br>look at this drawing you find out that<br>this is um this kind of represents an<br>office environment and um there are<br>three different kinds of indoor<br>environment quality we have here one is<br>the exam this this is a situation where<br>none of us can work it's either too cold<br>or it's too hot the other one is<br>adaptable indor environment quality now<br>the adaptable one is come on where human<br>beings we are all adaptable we can adapt<br>to varying temperature but then you find<br>out out with this new optimal um indoor<br>environment quality is is flattening<br>this curve towards a straight line as<br>such you have most of our offices are<br>air conditioned and the temperature is<br>year okay so um<br>this this actually brought some thoughts<br>to me one is most of these Studies have<br>concentrated on comfort and not<br>productivity and we know that Comfort is<br>not the same thing as productivity and<br>most of these buildings are been<br>designed for comfort and not<br>productivity so for us to say that um<br>this building actually make us more<br>productive it's something we should<br>think about the second one is<br>absenteeism but I ask us a question the<br>fact that I am in an office does it make<br>me productive I can come to the office<br>and watch YouTube all day I am not being<br>productive the third one is reported and<br>actual productivity we are all workers<br>and I'm not going to say I'm not<br>productive even if I'm asked because I'm<br>paid to be productive so if you ask me<br>am I productive of course I am I'm a<br>super being but am I actually productive<br>the second thing is performance test if<br>you pull me through a test I will do my<br>best to to you know to perform well but<br>that does not represent my normal<br>working condition cuz most times we<br>actually don't work that well the third<br>is factors that affect productivity is<br>it only the lighting the temperature and<br>the noise in our environment that<br>affects the way we work are there other<br>things like our personal um<br>characteristics or our relationships or<br>even our experiences at home our<br>cultural values is just are do these<br>things actually affect our<br>productivity now I've carried out some<br>empirical evidence on some buildings and<br>I'm yet to do the third one and I seted<br>these buildings based on their level of<br>glazing and the kind of ventilation<br>they've used over here they are<br>naturally ventilated no form of air<br>conditioning this m it and this is<br>strictly air conditioned and um I used<br>um the universal questioner which is<br>used which has been used both in UK and<br>us and so many other places to actually<br>prove the of green buildings are more<br>productive and I noticed in this<br>questionnaire they actually ask the<br>question are you productive and all of<br>them say yes now I I I developed my own<br>question here which the question I asked<br>is what makes you more productive and<br>what do you understand as being<br>productive I have gotten a lot of um<br>responses and from the review of<br>literature I've done I've come to<br>realize that most of the results are<br>conflicting if you actually look look at<br>these uh papers if you go through them<br>you find out that they all have a lot of<br>variations indicating there are other<br>things that actually affected the<br>results they got rather than the<br>physical factors of the environment the<br>second one<br>is most of these results have most of<br>these Studies have concentrated on<br>comfort and not productivity as such it<br>is best if we say that indoor<br>environment quality affects our comfort<br>and not our<br>productivity thirdly the empirical<br>evidence I I<br>I I carried out I found out that<br>inadequate sleep has been the most<br>determining Factor when it comes to<br>productivity followed by poor equipment<br>then under being under valued at work<br>even before temperature which is a<br>fiscal Factor another thing I want to<br>mention here is the is being adaptive<br>and optimal I've also come to realize<br>that people have actually said that they<br>prefer<br>fa the environment being being um FL the<br>the indoor environment quality of where<br>they are fluctuating they enjoy the fact<br>that I can feel cold at uh sometime I<br>could feel hot sometime it makes me feel<br>alive a very recent study has actually<br>proved that air conditioned environments<br>stimulate bordom you tend to have this<br>flat you tend to have this stable indoor<br>environment and you tend to get very<br>bored<br>as such concentrating on this picture I<br>would like to ask the question again<br>does architecture really improve our</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
