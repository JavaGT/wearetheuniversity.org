Engineering)</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>all right um good evening so I Anora and<br>the title of my study do you squeeze<br>before you sneeze and this is to do with<br>measuring intraabdominal pressures for<br>urodynamics now I'm currently doing my<br>masters with the Oakland bioengineering<br>Institute um with the pelvic floor group<br>and before I answer any questions or I<br>answer anything about my research let's<br>just have a little role play for those<br>of you who are genetically or genal<br>incapable imagine yourself as a woman a<br>picture perfect dignified lady just like<br>andamp it's coming<br>up go from the very famous show<br>Desperate Housewives now now Bri is said<br>to be the definition of class Perfection<br>and<br>dignity and now let's imagine<br>hypothetically let's say Brie has a<br>secret condition urinary andc continence<br>this would mean she has absolutely no<br>control over when she would start<br>leaking or<br>urinating can you imagine the impact<br>this would have on the reputation of<br>Brie who is so prim and<br>proper urinary Inc continence about 10%<br>of the population is affected by this<br>condition women are four times more<br>likely to suffer from it New Zealand has<br>200,000 women who have this condition<br>and yet it goes unnoticed because of the<br>social stigma it<br>carries this is a picture of the female<br>bladder now the bladder as we know it<br>holds a fluid and the urra is the tube<br>wi which it flows out of our system in<br>the normal noral condition the bladder<br>muscles they're quite relaxed and they<br>hold the fluid really well and the urra<br>is clamped shut together by the fster<br>muscles it's only when we choose to void<br>that these muscles relax and the fluid<br>leaks out comes out more like<br>it now the area my project deals with is<br>called stress urinary incontinence which<br>means in incontinence cause because of<br>exercise or<br>activity now when we go about a daily<br>exercises like sneezing or coughing or<br>jumping for example we create an<br>increase in intraabdominal pressure<br>that's pressure inside our abdomen and<br>this can sometimes Place extra pressure<br>on a bladder now with females who have<br>weak bladder muscles or weak Ural<br>muscles they're not able to hold the<br>fluid against this pressure so what you<br>get is involuntary<br>leakage can you imagine the lives of<br>women who are affected by this disorder<br>women are not able to lead normal social<br>lives they stop playing with their<br>children they stop<br>exercising and what you get is basically<br>loss of personality and loss of<br>character and therefore I ask the<br>question for how long can you squeeze<br>before you<br>sneeze<br>now urodynamics is an area which deals<br>with measuring these intraabdominal<br>pressures and measuring pressures in<br>your bladder to see what causes in<br>continents and what treatment methods<br>can we provide for it now in a normal<br>euramic Clinic the way intraabdominal<br>pressure is measured is why is by<br>placing a rectal sensor up your rectum<br>and this is the area of my research<br>measuring intraabdominal pressure now in<br>the clinic as I said the sensor goes up<br>your rectum and is connected to a<br>computer via long water fill tubes the<br>idea is to get the patient to cough or<br>Jog and to see what activ activities and<br>what pressures cause<br>leakage there are quite a few<br>limitations with the system though as I<br>said the tubes are water filled and<br>they're long so the pressure signal can<br>get displaced or dampened as it moves<br>down the water tubes motion artifacts<br>also if nurses are having a really busy<br>day they're not going to check for air<br>bubbles in the system and this causes<br>inaccuracies then there is peristalsis<br>which means rectal contractions they<br>cause interference with the pressure<br>readings finally the goes up a really<br>uncomfortable hole and most of our<br>patients are females elderly females who<br>complain about the system being<br>uncomfortable and often painful so the<br>clinicians at midmore hospital they<br>approached us to see if we could come up<br>with a better way to measure this<br>intraabdominal<br>pressure we've known that the vagina is<br>also a potential source of measuring<br>this pressure so what we have devised is<br>this novel intravaginal pressure device<br>and the way this works is on the top you<br>have your Silicone balloon which is<br>fluid filled and it has a pressure<br>sensor placed in it the sensor runs all<br>the way down to your transmitter and<br>Battery the idea is the silicone balloon<br>goes inside the vagina the transmitter<br>is connected it's just taped onto your<br>thigh you repeat the same protocol but<br>the difference is because the system is<br>Wireless all the pressure signals are<br>transmitted wirelessly to a receiver<br>within a 10 m radius in the room the<br>other part um of this device that is<br>acceptable to us is the Silicon balloon<br>is<br>shaped is shaped to follow the Contours<br>of the vagina and the material we use is<br>thin and compliant so patients actually<br>don't feel this inside their body and it<br>helps in comfort and retention so my job<br>was to further develop this device<br>because a long-term aim is to provide a<br>different way or an alternative way to<br>measure intraabdominal pressure as<br>opposed to the retial system so I'm<br>looking at how can can I improve this<br>device and design so the first area I<br>dealt with was looking at the Silicon<br>balloon improving its design and<br>production<br>methods now the average length of a<br>vagina is about 8 to 9 cm and the<br>initial balloons length we had was about<br>5.5 CM that's for our first prototype we<br>had and we didn't we realized that<br>pelvic floor muscles they may cause<br>interactions or interferences with our<br>pressure readings which is why we<br>decided to reduce it to 4 CMS<br>my next part was to look at production<br>of these balloons the old method of<br>creating these balloons was now if you<br>can imagine water the way it sets in ice<br>cream I mean ice tubes ice trays the<br>same way we made a mold with perspect<br>sheets and we Mill the design of our<br>silicon balloons onto it we clamped two<br>sheets together we inserted some silicon<br>in the middle and we put this in an oven<br>but it takes 24 hours for the Silicon to<br>set cuz the oven we had only worked at<br>35Â° so over 24 hours all we got was one<br>balloon and that too we had two pieces<br>of silicon which we had to seal together<br>and then place the sensor it was highly<br>inefficient luckily for us the Institute<br>purchased a silicon transfer press<br>machine and my job was to create a mold<br>which would be compatible with this<br>machine that's the mold on top and<br>that's a picture of me holding a really<br>cool machine gun what this is is um it's<br>a silicon mixing machine and I'm using<br>it now to play in the picture to play<br>silicon into the transfer press machine<br>I then place my mold on top of it the<br>machine clamps together the pressure is<br>high enough to inject the Silicon into<br>my mold and within 2 minutes because the<br>machine operates at 135 degrees CI I get<br>a balloon which is sealed on three sides<br>and one side is left open for me to<br>place the sensor so this has helped us<br>improve our productivity by at least 100<br>times in terms of timing<br>so future work with this device now that<br>I know I can improve the production<br>method we did try it in a few volunteers<br>to see if it if it's retainable you know<br>we did reduce the size of the balloon<br>and it was so our next step is now to do<br>some clinical trials we have ethics to<br>test our device in 24 patients in a<br>proper urodynamics Clinic what we aim to<br>do is place it alongside the rectal<br>Clinic I mean the rectal system so we<br>can compare the measurements the<br>retention and the comfort also things I<br>aim to improve on I want to build um a<br>charger so I can charge my device W<br>wirelessly in the clinic I'm also<br>looking at building the user interface<br>so I can um so we can have data<br>collection and data presentation<br>remember we're trying to make our own<br>system so what we need is our own user<br>interface our own collection systems our<br>own<br>device um and because we aim to<br>commercialize this device sometime in<br>the future I'm also looking at what<br>regulations are necessary to do so<br>especially for the US and Europe<br>markets so to conclude we have<br>successfully created a prototype to<br>measure intraabdominal pressure and the<br>long-term aim as I said was to use it as<br>a replacement for the rectal catheter<br>method at least for women<br>only and a future extension of this<br>device could be to use it to check how<br>exercises affect the pelvic floor organs<br>just for a summary you say what I say a<br>pressure device<br>you say where I say shove it up there<br>and you say why well ladies it's because<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
