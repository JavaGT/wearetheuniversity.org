WITH RADIOLOGY (Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences)</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening everyone and welcome to my<br>presentation my name is Andrew Lee and<br>I'm a master of science candidate and<br>today I'll be presenting my Master's<br>thesis which is titled correction of<br>clinically important errors and MRI<br>measurement of blood flow which I've<br>been working on for the past 6 months at<br>the department of radiology anatomy of<br>radiology under the supervision of do<br>associate professors Brett Cohen and<br>Alis young so let's get right into it so<br>what is<br>MRI MRI or magnetic resonance imaging is<br>a medical diagnostic imaging technique<br>that allows clinicians to see<br>cross-sectional slices of the human body<br>the perhaps you've even been inside an<br>MRI scanner interestingly we can also<br>flow now so blood flow measurements<br>blood flow measurements are very<br>important clinically because um for<br>example we use blood flow measurements<br>to assess patients undergoing cardiac<br>surgery as well as uh babies of<br>congenital heart<br>disease<br>typically this is done using an<br>ultrasound technique called uh Doppler<br>echocardiography now Mr offers a<br>technique called phas contrast that also<br>allows the quantification of blood flow<br>and the face contrast scan sequence<br>produces two images the first is a<br>magnitude image and the second is a phas<br>image in the magnitude image you can see<br>anatomical structures and in the phase<br>image the pixel value of the phase image<br>represents the speed at which blood is<br>Flowing at that<br>location and using the phase image we<br>can calculate interesting statistics<br>like flow rate and cardiac output now<br>face contrast has recently gained a lot<br>of attention because it's actually a<br>more accurate method than traditional<br>methods such as Doppler<br>echocardiography however we have found<br>that there are still some problems with<br>the phase contrast technique<br>now the main problem with phase contrast<br>is a measurement error called background<br>phase this is a color enhanced<br>background phase contrast image<br>measuring the flow rate inside the<br>aort interestingly this is not the image<br>that we get from the MRI scanner what we<br>actually get from the MRI scanner is<br>this image here and as you can see that<br>the colors of the two images are<br>slightly different indicating that we<br>actually measuring slightly different<br>velocities now this difference or error<br>is called the background<br>phase so why do we get a background<br>phase appearing in our<br>images and the answer is because of Edie<br>currents Edie currents are electric<br>currents that get induced inside the<br>scanner as a result of the scanner's<br>rapidly changing magnetic field it's<br>basically the same idea behind how<br>generators generate<br>electricity during an MRI scan the<br>magnetic field inside the scanner<br>changes rapidly it it it pulses up and<br>down and in the phase contrast scan this<br>waveform has to be very accurate in<br>order to get accurate measurement<br>results however because of Eddie<br>currents this waveform actually becomes<br>distorted and as a result we get a<br>background phase appearing in our<br>images to give you an idea of how<br>serious this problem is a research group<br>in 2010 published a paper evaluating the<br>accuracy of MRI scanners in measuring<br>flow rates in the AA and Main ponary<br>archeries this graph shows the<br>measurement error of scanners made by<br>three different manufacturers tested at<br>12 different<br>locations the Threshold at Plus orus 0.<br>six shows what is the acceptable error<br>and as you can see all the MRI scanners<br>fail to meet this<br>requirement all the stuff that I have<br>presented to you is stuff that we<br>already know I've told you that<br>background phase is real and it's a<br>serious problem in Phase Contrast MRI so<br>how does my research tie into the grand<br>scheme of things The Next Step would be<br>to find a way of correcting this problem<br>in order to correct for background phase<br>we need to know the background phase<br>image because if we know the background<br>phase image then we can just simply<br>subtract it out and and that gives you<br>the true velocity<br>image however the problem is in all<br>cases we don't actually know what this<br>is so my research is about answering the<br>question well given any image or scan<br>sequence what is the background face and<br>interesting<br>no one has actually found a solution to<br>this<br>problem the way that I'm going to<br>approach this problem is to use a<br>mathematical modeling approach never<br>been done before the idea is that we can<br>actually describe background phase very<br>accurately using mathematical surfaces<br>for example here I'm using a<br>two-dimensional surface to describe the<br>spatial distribution of background pH of<br>the image on the left and we can extend<br>this idea into three four four or even<br>more<br>Dimensions the way to approach this is<br>to First measure the background phase in<br>all three dimensions of space and time<br>and this would involve running scans<br>that sample the background phase at<br>different slice<br>orientations we then fit this data to a<br>model and this would allow us to predict<br>the background phase for any scan<br>sequence so how do we measure background<br>phase<br>the idea is that instead of putting a<br>patient inside the scanner we put<br>something called a phantom and a Fantom<br>is a substitute for a human being for<br>example this orange ball that I have<br>made for my Master's project now this<br>Phantom here is stationary that means<br>that there are no moving parts inside<br>the Phantom so that means any nonzero<br>velocities that we register in our phase<br>contrast images must be purely due to<br>background f<br>phase the scan sequence that I used is a<br>special ed current scan sequence and you<br>can think of this as a simplified<br>version of the more complicated phase<br>contrast scan sequence what the scan<br>sequence does is that it produces a<br>single step change in the scanner's<br>magnetic field now this step change in<br>the in the scanner's magnetic field<br>deliberately induces any currents and<br>then which therefore induces a<br>background pH and we can measure this<br>background pH at different instances in<br>time and fit a curve to<br>it that would allow us to predict the<br>background phase in the time<br>Dimension now the reason for doing this<br>is because of the idea that any scan<br>sequence is really a whole bunch of Step<br>changes so if we can describe the<br>background phase for a single step<br>change then we can just use<br>superposition to find the resultant<br>background phase phase for any scan<br>sequence of course the output of the<br>scan is an image so we also get spatial<br>information after about 40 hours of<br>scanning and processing using some<br>software that I've written I was able to<br>produce this animation which shows the<br>background phase as a result of a single<br>step change in the scanner's magnetic<br>field at one slice orientation and how<br>it Chang changes in the spatial and time<br>Dimensions the more interesting features<br>of this animation is its variation in<br>the time Dimension so for example if we<br>take this point here and prod its value<br>in the time Dimension we get this graph<br>which shows that background phase<br>actually decays with time and we would<br>expect this because the Ed currents<br>responsible for background phase should<br>also Decay with time due to the<br>resistance of the scanner conductive<br>housing<br>however a more interesting or perhaps<br>concerning observation is that when we<br>repeated the exact same experiment on a<br>different day we actually get different<br>results and this seems to suggest that<br>background phase varies in time in the<br>long-term sense which of true would be a<br>major limitation to this method because<br>in that means we wouldn't be able to<br>predict it<br>anymore we think that this may be due to<br>temperature fluctuations inside the<br>scanner as temp back phase is also<br>sensitive to temperature however the<br>reason why the two results are<br>inconsistent remains uh work of ongoing<br>research so in summary I've told you<br>that phase contrast is a highly accurate<br>method for quanying flow provided we fix<br>the background phase problem current<br>research shows that background phase is<br>caused by unintentionally induced Ed<br>currents and<br>that background phase is the most<br>commonly common source of error and it's<br>caused by Edie currents now my<br>experiments have shown that background<br>phase is geometrically simple and that<br>we can also very accurately predict it<br>using<br>mathematical and the tability is UN<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
