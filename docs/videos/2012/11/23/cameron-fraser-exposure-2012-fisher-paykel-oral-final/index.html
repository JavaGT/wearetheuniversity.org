I'm here tonight to talk to<br>you about an exciting new technology<br>developed right here at this<br>University There's A New Concept in<br>Medicine of regeneration so instead of<br>treating diseases with drugs or surgery<br>the idea is you restore function by<br>repairing or replacing damaged cells and<br>tissues in particular there has been a<br>lot of research into developing better<br>treatments for common neurological<br>diseases some of these include glooma<br>stroke spinal cery and Park<br>which affect hundreds of millions of<br>people<br>worldwide in fact there are over 100<br>clinical trials currently underway<br>looking at regenerative treatments for<br>these<br>diseases however most of these new<br>treatments require a source of<br>cells and all of the current sources of<br>cells have a variety of<br>disadvantages you may have heard the<br>controversy surrounding embryonic stem<br>cells however they don't just have the<br>ethical concerns surrounding them they<br>also have the problem of tissue<br>rejection you're taking cells from one<br>individual and transplanting them to<br>another that's why people developed<br>induced plop poent stem cells and direct<br>cell reprogramming which overcomes these<br>advantages but it brings up new problems<br>because it involves genetic manipulation<br>and is a highly inefficient<br>process that's also with mentioning<br>adult stem cells that have their own<br>disadvantages like being difficult to<br>isolate and limited repair<br>potential however a new technology has<br>been developed at the University of<br>Orland to try and overcome some of these<br>disadvantages it's been found that cites<br>a cell from the eye can be reprogrammed<br>into neurons simply by exposing it to<br>three specific growth<br>factors this has the advantages of not<br>involving any genetic<br>manipulation it allows you to take cells<br>from a patient and in theory give it<br>back to the same patient and most<br>excitingly 100% of the cells start<br>reprogramming within 3<br>days however it has one major<br>disadvantage and that's quantity you<br>can't take many cells out of someone's<br>eye without compromising their Vision so<br>that's where I come in that's my project<br>find a way to make more neurons using<br>this<br>technology for those of you here that<br>aren't opthalmologists just to give you<br>some context the cornea is the<br>transparent structure at the front of<br>the eye where the CTO sites reside it<br>has three layers the middle layer is<br>called the stroma and it's jam-packed<br>with cites the cells that we're<br>reprogramming so there's a few<br>challenges to making more neurons<br>chiefly cites they don't<br>proliferate which makes making war of<br>them quite<br>difficult so the initial approach to my<br>research was find a way to proliferate<br>these Crites<br>however every time I got the cyes to<br>proliferate they turned into this other<br>closely related cell type called corneal<br>fiber blasts so I thought why don't I<br>let the problem be the<br>solution can I find a way to reprogram<br>these proliferative and abundant corneal<br>fiber blasts which will then solve this<br>issue of<br>quantity and the results from my<br>research strongly suggest that yes these<br>corneal fiber blasts can be reprog<br>Med so to answer these questions I used<br>a combination of mamalian cell culture<br>imunohistochemistry and I also formed a<br>collaboration with the neurophysiology<br>lab here at the<br>University I used both human and rat<br>tissue for my research in brief I<br>dissected the Eyes under a surgical<br>microscope to isolate the stroma where<br>the cyes reside I then released the cyes<br>from the tissue with a special cocktail<br>of enzymes and then I cultured the cyes<br>and serum containing media to turn them<br>into these corneal fiber blasts and to<br>proliferate them so I could make large<br>quantities of them and then finally I<br>reprogrammed<br>them so what I can tell you from a<br>research is that a highly proliferated<br>population of corneal fiber blasts when<br>cultured in those three specific growth<br>factors listed there take on a neuronal<br>morphology and start expressing neuronal<br>proteins<br>after only 5 days of reprogramming we<br>can see a striking difference in<br>morphology on the right here we can see<br>in the control group The Classic corneal<br>fi blast morphology and over in the<br>experimental group you can see<br>strikingly different morphology with all<br>these fine dendri processes which is<br>what you'd expect from<br>neurons after 7 Days of reprogram<br>reprogramming I start seeing neuronal<br>precursor proteins being expressed like<br>neston and neurofilament 200 and after<br>12 days of reprogramming I start seeing<br>mature neur neuronal proteins being<br>expressed like beta3<br>tubulin however there's one thing that I<br>haven't been been able to ascertain and<br>that's if these neurons are<br>functional neurons are electrically<br>active cells and this electrical<br>activity can be<br>measured however when we've gone to<br>measure this electric activity we found<br>that cell program for 7<br>days don't have the electrical activity<br>you'd expect from<br>neurons so my thinking is we haven't<br>reprogrammed them for long enough to get<br>that electrical functionality so the<br>current experiments we're planning is to<br>reprogram the cells for longer and then<br>see if they'll have this electrical<br>activity so that's the main current<br>direction of my research and also want<br>to quantify the<br>proliferation I want to see work put a<br>number to exactly how many neurons can I<br>make from a fixed small starting number<br>of<br>cites what well there's some exciting<br>implications for This research I mean if<br>these reprogrammed fiber blasts are<br>actually fun turn out to be functional<br>neurons this will be a novel source of<br>neurons unlike anything else in the<br>world that has been published to<br>date future directions of the technology<br>will be to move on to animal therapeutic<br>trials to see if these cells can be used<br>to restore function and disease and it's<br>also worth considering what other<br>reprogramming is<br>possible recently one of my colleagues<br>has shown that condr sites cells from<br>cartilage nothing to do with the eye can<br>also be reprogrammed into neurons using<br>the same non- gentic method so begs the<br>question what other useful reprogramming<br>is possible with the right growth<br>factors so in conclusion a novel source<br>of urance has been discovered at this<br>University it has some great advantages<br>like not involving genetic manipulation<br>being highly efficient with 100% of the<br>cells reprogramming in a short space of<br>time however it has the main stumbling<br>block of<br>quantity however my research with<br>corneal F Blas promises to overcome this<br>issue of<br>quantity looks like I have time tonight<br>to thank my supervisors Colin and Trevor<br>and also my Kylie Carol for all their<br>help this year I'd also like to thank<br>all the people who donated the ISA<br>science that made this research possible<br>and also all the sources of funding that<br>also without This research wouldn't be</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
