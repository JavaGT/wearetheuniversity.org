0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening<br>everyone uh in today's presentation I<br>will discuss some of my preliminary<br>findings on the tsunami damage to<br>Coastal structures this project is in uh<br>partnership with natural Hazard research<br>platform and supervised by Professor<br>Bruce Melville and associate professor s<br>m tsunami is a Japanese word consisting<br>of two terms Su means Harbor and Nami<br>implies wave therefore it can be<br>translated as the harbor wave H these<br>two figure illustrates the historical<br>understandings of Japanese and mores<br>from tsunami which goes back to 19th<br>century uh these two figures shows that<br>tsunami is not a new phenomena but after<br>the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami it became<br>the interest of coastal engineers<br>and recently the 2011 Japan tsunami<br>highlighted the need for tsunami<br>research uh here is Ring of Fire where<br>about 80% of tsunami occur and New<br>Zealand as a part of this region is<br>vulnerable to Tsunami events due to its<br>long coastline in this map I will show<br>you uh the expected wave heights from<br>local and dist stand tsunami that can<br>affect the New Zealand coasts and<br>gisburn is the most risky part of the<br>country<br>uh uh this is gisburn Har Harbor which<br>is flooded by 1960 uh Chile tsunami and<br>also napia affected by about 4.5 M<br>tsunami and this is a tsunami wave which<br>is approaching the littelton harbor<br>after 2010 Chile tsunami and also<br>recently because of the Japan tsunami<br>you can see the water level raised in uh<br>the name is very difficult Tut Kaka yeah<br>for about uh one meter uh so tsunami can<br>cause much destruction as Illustrated in<br>this graph you can see the uh Indian<br>Ocean tsunami caused uh death of over<br>250,000 people and this is considered as<br>the deadliest natural disaster of the<br>21st century uh similarly tsunami has<br>high uh cost I mean the high cost is<br>associated with tunami res tsunami<br>damage and here again the Japan tsunami<br>uh caused more than 200 billion US<br>Dollars damage cost so it shows that<br>there is a vital need to have a tsunami<br>ready Community with developing the<br>mitigation strategies and also with<br>improving the public awareness uh so we<br>need to know more about tsunami uh first<br>we need to know what CA Tsunami Tsunami<br>uh can be triggered by the impulsive<br>displacement of of large volume of water<br>due to the uh underwater landslides<br>earthquake volcanic eruptions or meteor<br>impact and okay because of some<br>technical problem we need to run it<br>manually tsunamis are series of uh long<br>waves travel the length of the ocean<br>with the velocity of 600 to 900 kilm per<br>hour uh as fast as the jet can flies and<br>then they uh get high as they reach<br>uh they get the maximum uh height near<br>the shorelines and eventually brecks and<br>become a tsunami boore this tsunami<br>boore rushes Inland and damage some<br>initial Coastal infrastructure and pick<br>as debris and then they carry these<br>piece of Dees then hit them to the<br>following structures and damage them and<br>sometime you can see that the uh<br>uh<br>sorry okay the whole building is<br>detached from the ground and becomes the<br>floating Dey so the research objectives<br>are to find and quantify the force that<br>applies to the front face of the<br>structure and uh this this has received<br>very limited attention and then uh sorry<br>a scale up of this result to the full<br>structural scale to be used for design<br>purpose uh in this photo this is one of<br>the few structures that survive the<br>recent Japanese tsunami the question is<br>why and how so we need to study more uh<br>to understand the design characteristics<br>of such buildings and this research will<br>uh generate valuable data for design<br>purpose and also will lead to improved<br>resilience of coastal infrastructures to<br>Cami forces and enhance recovery<br>policies and programming after uh<br>disaster for this purpose uh a physical<br>model is developed in Hydraulic<br>Engineering Lab at the University of<br>Oakland which is consisting of a large<br>Reservoir with an attached large wave<br>flum at the end of the wave FL an<br>automatic gate is designed and installed<br>to generate the tsunami bore the gate<br>system allows to rapidly Rising the<br>sliding gate together with sou opening<br>of the shutters and uh a scale of 1 by<br>17 um a scale model of a structure is<br>constructed and situated 10 m after The<br>Flume Inlet and the cross-section of<br>this structure is 300 into 300 mm and it<br>is constructed without openings just to<br>represent the worst<br>scenario uh to give an example of the<br>collected data uh uh multiple tsunami<br>Bard depth were measured with uh depth<br>transducers and this graph shows you the<br>Bard propagation along the length of the<br>channel uh for different experimental<br>runs then we measured the uh B height<br>and velocities in front of the structure<br>which is 100 mm and 2.5 m/s respectively<br>then we assume that this B height is<br>equivalent to height of one story<br>building it means that the tsunami can<br>cover one story building which is 2.5 M<br>and it gave us the geometrical<br>similarity to scale up these results to<br>the real case so which resulted in 1.7 m<br>b height and 10.2 m/ second velocity<br>then we compared these measurements with<br>the real case in the case of Indian<br>Ocean tsunami the war height was 225 M<br>and for Japan tsunami it was varied<br>between 2 to uh 7 m While most of the<br>structures they experienc 2 to 3 m and<br>also the velocity range 4 to 8 m/s for<br>the case of Indian Ocean tsunami and 6<br>to 9 m per second in the case of Japan<br>tsunami uh can you please run this video<br>this is a typical experimental run<br>during my experiments and as you can see<br>a tsunami board generated is just<br>rushing toward the structure and hit the<br>structure and exactly this is the time<br>we measure the force and pressure which<br>applies to the front face of the<br>structure this video captured with highs<br>speeed camera with uh 210 Fram per<br>uh<br>graph<br>is okay uh so I don't know just again<br>for technical purpose and reason we miss<br>this graph uh we measured the maximum<br>force uh equal to for 41.6 Newton and<br>this one is equivalent to the force uh<br>of 193 kilon which applies on its<br>geometrically similar prototype building<br>and results in 23 kilopascal pressure on<br>the front face of the building and then<br>based on these results we just defined a<br>multiplication to the tsunami sorry to<br>the hydrostatic force uh equal to 2.4<br>which shows that tsunami force is<br>equivalent to 2.4 times of the<br>hydrostatic Force the term hydrostatic<br>Force here refers to the force of stored<br>Water behind the dam that can exert to a<br>vertical wall of the dam uh so during<br>the test uh the generated wave uh caused<br>a mini tsunami in the lab and you can<br>see part of the uh wall of the channel<br>was broken uh fortunately there was no<br>loss of life and I'm Al live here so but<br>we spent around $1,000 in repairing the<br>damage Parts uh this is ongoing project<br>and we already we already done and<br>finished other uh experimental<br>configurations like uh testing on<br>different geometrical shape of the<br>structures at different orientations and<br>future plan is aimed uh to develop a new<br>instrument which we call it a smart<br>debris to measure the impact force of<br>floating debris on this structure in<br>conclusion uh experimental measurements<br>of the uh tsunami Force applied on the<br>front face of the structure presented<br>here which was equivalent to 240% of the<br>hydrostatic force that can be applied on<br>the front phas so at the end I would<br>like to uh acknowledge the following<br>organization and also thank you very<br>presentation</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
