accurate.</p><p>okay well I think we'll um start on time<br>so um a very good afternoon thank you<br>very much for coming to this uh Forum<br>organized and hosted jointly by the<br>center for Theology and public issues<br>and seasafe the center for<br>sustainability agriculture food energy<br>and environment my name is Andrew<br>bradstock I'm director of the center for<br>Theology and public issues and I'll be<br>chairing and coordinating the first half<br>and then we'll be throwing the meeting<br>open to questions and discussion and Dr<br>Janet Stevenson the director of seasafe<br>will be uh chairing and facilitating the<br>the second half um just a little plug if<br>you're interested in the kind of<br>meetings that we organize at the center<br>for Theology and public issues and you<br>aren't already on our mailing list do<br>take the opportunity to sign up on the<br>way out there's a sign up sheet there if<br>you'd like to be on our mailing list and<br>also some literature about the center if<br>you'd like to know more about it well<br>this is a an opportunity to discuss one<br>of the if not the big issues uh of our<br>time climate change and in particular<br>some of the ethical issues around it and<br>we're very privileged to have an expert<br>panel with us this afternoon and I'll<br>introduce them to you in a minute but<br>just what do we mean by exploring<br>ethical issues around climate change<br>well given what the global scientific<br>Community tells us is happening to our<br>our planet what kind of issues does that<br>knowledge raise for us how should we<br>respond well one response might be<br>actually of course to welcome climate<br>change to say bring it on it's going to<br>have lots of benefits and um you might<br>have seen recently for example the<br>comments by the chief executive of New<br>Zealand wine Growers Philip grian who<br>points to the fact that New Zealand has<br>long had trouble uh producing Wines in<br>significant EXP sport quantities due to<br>its weather budy says that may change<br>higher temperatures due to global<br>warming are expected to make cold areas<br>more temperate and better suited to<br>Grape cultiv<br>cultivation so it's no surprise he says<br>that wine Growers are upbeat about a<br>future that includes climate change the<br>big picture he says for New Zealand wine<br>is very very good or if that didn't<br>cheer you up perhaps some words from Tim<br>shad the mayor of inaro might do the job<br>he thought global warming would attract<br>more tourists especially to the South<br>Island shadbolt says we reckon with<br>global warming kicking in and all this<br>catastrophic climate change coming maybe<br>having a cold climate could work in our<br>favor shadbolt said that his fellow<br>towns people like to think they were<br>environmentally conscious but secretly<br>we're all thrilled to hear that world<br>temperatures were set to rise by 2°<br>there were cheers across the city it<br>will be warmer and this will be the<br>place people want to be so welcome to in<br>Caril tomorrow's tail Ranger now of<br>course there are big questions over how<br>realistic that is as a picture of New<br>Zealand's future but behind all that<br>there are some very fundamental<br>questions in this for all of us how will<br>we feel if our quality of life is<br>maintained here or even improved whilst<br>around us other people in other<br>countries including of course islands in<br>the South Pacific suffer terrible<br>consequences as a result of our inaction<br>on climate<br>change or what impact will leaving a<br>challenging Legacy for future<br>Generations have on the way that we see<br>ourselves<br>today and how might a decision not to<br>take a leading role internationally<br>impact on the psyche of new zealanders<br>well that's just a few questions and to<br>help us kind of unpack and explore some<br>of these big questions our our panel<br>this afternoon which I'm now going to<br>introduce to you in the order in which<br>they're going to speak to us Dr Jim<br>Salinger in the middle is wellknown and<br>much respected climate change scientist<br>who until early 2009 worked for the<br>crown Research Institute Nea the<br>National Institute of water and<br>Atmospheric research and as well as<br>Jim's high-profile work for Nea he's<br>best known for his involvement with ipcc<br>the intern intergovernmental panel on<br>climate change which as you know is the<br>body tasked with reviewing and assessing<br>the most recent scientific and Technical<br>information produced worldwide that's<br>relevant to understanding climate change<br>and Jim is a lead author with uh ipcc<br>and of course in that capacity Jim<br>shared the Nobel Prize in 2007 with<br>other members of ipcc and and Al Gore<br>um Jim was actually born here in denan<br>but he's now based in ockland and is<br>currently with Rod Oram and Professor<br>Caroline saers from Lincoln University<br>undertaking a Road Show going around the<br>country to raise awareness and promote<br>dialogue around climate change with uh<br>farming and other communities across the<br>country and they were doing that with<br>local farmers here this afternoon uh<br>earlier today at the Edgar<br>Center that leads me on to Rod nearest<br>to me here who will also be well known<br>to many of you as a<br>commentator uh in the media and a writer<br>on business and economic matters Rod has<br>a regular column in the Sunday star<br>times and good magazine and frequently<br>appears on radio and TV and rods has<br>more than 30 years experience as an<br>International Financial journalist<br>working both in Europe including for the<br>financial times in London and in North<br>America and since moving to New Zealand<br>in 1997 Rod has been an adjunct<br>professor in the business school at<br>unitech Oakland's tertiary technology<br>Institute and was recently commissioned<br>by the Royal Commission on the<br>governance of Oakland to write a<br>briefing paper on ockland in the year<br>2060 will we live to see that Rod is<br>author of Reinventing Paradise how New<br>Zealand is starting to earn a bigger<br>sustainable living in the world economy<br>and of course the theme of<br>sustainability will be Central this<br>evening and of course to the road show<br>that Rod is doing with Jim and<br>Caroline and the third member of our<br>panel is Laura black uh chief executive<br>and director of the Methodist Mission<br>based here in dedin Laura has 25 years<br>experience of working with community and<br>voluntary sector organizations and has<br>been involved in a whole host of of uh<br>of Nos and organizations including<br>Samaritans and welfare rights team<br>women's Refuge the Small Business Center<br>nmit tatari Mari program advisory<br>committee in Nelson and various other<br>bodies concerned with young people<br>housing which will be one of her themes<br>of evening um Outdoor Pursuits and<br>Community radio she's also been involved<br>at National level in the UK Trade union<br>movement and has also of course worked<br>here at the University of ataro as head<br>of our alumni and development office and<br>Laura is also currently a member of The<br>Institute of directors and a JP so<br>that's our expert panel who are going to<br>lead us in the first half of our session<br>this evening and I suppose I ought to<br>say since we're looking at ethical<br>issues and this meeting is co-hosted by<br>the center for theology ol olog and<br>public issues uh Jim describes himself<br>as ethnically and culturally Jewish uh<br>Rod is a practicing Anglican and Laura<br>Methodist work that one out anyway I'm<br>going to invite each to speak for 10 to<br>15 minutes max and um and and then uh<br>I'll sit down and Janet will chair uh<br>there'll be a roving mic going around<br>and we'll have plenty of time for<br>discussion and questions so without<br>further Ado what are the potential<br>impacts of climate change on our ethics<br>morals and national identity if we do<br>Jim thank you Andrew and Kiora Oto tooa<br>and it's nice to be in denan with the<br>northeasterly welting in the<br>northwesterly coming in so um so really<br>I will take aspects from the Jewish<br>tradition but um I just want to very<br>quickly say that temperatures are<br>warming up uh Glaciers are<br>shrinking uh so there's Antarctic sea<br>ice is disappearing rapidly so it's all<br>happening and sea levels are rising and<br>really the important ethical issue we<br>faces where we are now and we're really<br>at the Y Junction of making decisions<br>we can really hold back on rapid<br>development of new technology and just<br>keep temperatures<br>2° or we can just increasing use of<br>fossil fuels and off we are to a four or<br>maybe five degree future by the end of<br>the century and the impacts of that will<br>be dramatic last week I was in the<br>Pacific Islands we're looking at climate<br>and Fisheries but the issue there is<br>people in tuvalu and kurbas are going to<br>have to relocate now imagine if you have<br>to move you no longer have a sovereign<br>country what that means and this is<br>wisdom from Tim flery from the<br>Australian climate commission this is<br>the critical decade decisions we make<br>now to 2020 will determine the severity<br>of climate change in our children and<br>grandchildren experience we basically on<br>the roller coaster and we've set<br>planetary process a drift and we really<br>have to get active and these show you<br>fossil fuel emissions we are not doing<br>well we're very much on a business as<br>usual<br>scenario um so and then we spill the<br>planet into tipping points and you get<br>disappearing<br>Greenland one to two degrees actic sea<br>ice melts boreal forest ibec Continental<br>glazes go and West Antarctic ice sheet<br>these show you the various trigger<br>points which are pushing the climate<br>system beyond what civilized society is<br>known a Str civilized society so we are<br>very<br>much changing the climate system there's<br>no doubt about it so and<br>scientists when you put them together a<br>conservative as Naomi Arcus is who wrote<br>the merchants of doubt she's a science<br>historian so if you put Bunches of<br>scientists together they er on the side<br>of least alarm and here's Steve the late<br>Steve<br>Schneider uh estimating sea level rise<br>ipcc assessments went all conservative<br>20 to 80 M sea level rise suddenly<br>there's a whole lot of new science<br>saying um right you forgot to put in the<br>uh ice melting from Greenland Antarctic<br>Ice Sheets and new measurements come in<br>they just left them out and didn't put<br>in any error bars and<br>Whoopi you'll sea level rise estimates<br>and they're 50 to 160 cm which which are<br>very much like the early estimate so and<br>of course um Texas is burning so things<br>are happening so really I want to now<br>draw on the Jewish tradition and it very<br>much has humans of Guardians of the<br>planet and this is where I want to get<br>in to the ethics um this is the view of<br>the full Earth taken on route to the<br>Moon in December<br>1972 and what we see I think when people<br>could actually see the moon from above<br>they started thinking of the earth as<br>actual<br>system and this is from Genesis the<br>heavens and earth were finished and all<br>their<br>array um so creation basically this is<br>judaic tradition<br>is seen as a closed system it's complete<br>selfcontained and dynamic all actions<br>are integrated in God's universe and the<br>impact of these actions affects the<br>balance and system of life this is<br>showing you smoke from the 1980s Gulf<br>War with the Kuwait oil worlds War<br>satellite the massive plumes of smoke<br>with photograph drifting over Kuwait and<br>Saudi Arabian coastline so if you look<br>an ancient commentary from the Hebrew<br>Bible see that you do not spoil and<br>destroy my world for there will be no<br>more after you to repair it so very<br>much um judaic tradition doesn't tend to<br>look at life after death um it deals<br>very much with the here and now and that<br>we are<br>Guardians and really there are three<br>ancient<br>Traditions which come from the Jewish<br>midrash were reminded by God that we<br>were created after the mosquito that we<br>are but a part of life but not its heart<br>so so we weren't created above the<br>Hebrew Bible teaches us how to act to<br>maintain or to reinstate balance in the<br>world so that we may live and these ttic<br>laws of environmental balance and<br>protection come under three categories<br>of Jewish law<br>or B tashat do not destroy shamr Adar<br>guard the Earth tikum Al repair the<br>world and it's interesting when you um<br>compare<br>um the seven days of creational seven<br>epochs depending on whether you take a<br>geological view or biblical view but the<br>seventh day the idea of the Sabbath<br>which was to rest and the environment<br>needs to rest and repair so firstly do<br>not destroy secondly guard the world and<br>thirdly repair the world and this is<br>very much the three C categories of<br>Jewish law so it is clear from the texts<br>of the Torah that's the five books of<br>Moses that God originally created a<br>living<br>biosphere or something you know it came<br>into being where in all systems<br>functioned optimally and<br>dynamically though the repair of the<br>world may take many<br>generations we can begin today to find<br>our way back to the Harmony and diic<br>life seen in if we think of the<br>originally how the Earth was as the<br>Garden of Eden so really it depends on<br>each of us and all of us and the choice<br>is ours and the hard work will be ours<br>so<br>really it's really a matter of<br>Guardianship and whether we choose life<br>in a living biosphere or we choose just<br>to let shall we say the rot go on in the<br>destruction of the<br>biosphere so really I think that's my 10<br>minutes<br>um but I think really the whole judaic<br>tradition is about those three<br>principles and then you'll find if you<br>think about them they're thinking<br>intergenerational because you're<br>repairing you're protecting your<br>guarding so I'll leave my comments there<br>you good afternoon and thank you very<br>much and for in inviting me to<br>participate in this I mean it's also<br>wonderful to have a chance to talk about<br>ethics um and um morality when it comes<br>to climate change because those are very<br>very Central and Essential Elements<br>which are very hard to get any kind of<br>traction on um when we talk about<br>climate change and more as the pity<br>because if lots of people did understand<br>the issues um from an ethical or<br>spiritual point of view um then it might<br>be a lot easier to do something about<br>climate change issues and um and that's<br>the theme I want to um elaborate<br>on let me just deal first of all why we<br>probably don't um have much luck with a<br>spiritual perspective um I think that<br>the failure to must anything of a<br>spiritual response about climate change<br>uh probably comes down to the plain FL<br>fact that spirituality is such a<br>diminished facet of many people's lives<br>these days so any kind of sense of<br>relationship with or communion with or<br>um expressions of of life and a sense of<br>Greater purpose of being um is quite a<br>foreign notion to many people um when it<br>comes to a failure to must an ethical<br>response um I think this comes down to<br>the nature of the climate change problem<br>itself and here I've long been very<br>taken by a wonderful quote which goes<br>back now almost a decade um from Daniel<br>Abassi um who at that time was the<br>director of Yale University's School of<br>Forestry and Environmental Studies he<br>since retired and he wrote almost a<br>decade ago the problem of climate change<br>is almost perfectly designed to test the<br>limits of any modern society's capacity<br>for response one might even call it the<br>perfect problem for its uniquely<br>daunting Confluence of forces and he<br>names four um the first is that for many<br>people the issues seem remote in time<br>and place it's going to happen later or<br>it's going to happen to those uh people<br>out in the Pacific Islands not here the<br>second thing is that the issues are uh<br>of course incredibly complicated um but<br>the third one is the problems are<br>politicized and obscured by the cultural<br>filters we use um and I would argue that<br>um those cultural filters themselves um<br>are very faulty because of um a lack of<br>Greater spiritual or ethical um<br>Foundation to them and then lastly the<br>way we um organize Society politically<br>and economically means that um the<br>incentives and the motivations to seek<br>and deliver Collective action on this<br>are very much thwarted um it's kind of<br>um every person for themselves so in<br>other in other words we need to turn all<br>of those issues on their head if we're<br>trying trying to get any kind of um<br>response to climate change let a let<br>alone a um a moral or um spiritual one<br>so firstly we have to convincingly<br>demonstrate to people that the issues<br>here and now um and they are um we are<br>seeing um extreme um weather um with uh<br>patterns that are very much tied back to<br>climate change and as Jim has shown<br>temperatures and sea levels are<br>demonstrably<br>rising we also then have to explain<br>those um issues in very true engaging<br>and accessible ways now obviously I'm a<br>bit of a romantic as a journalist I<br>believe that if something can be<br>explained<br>and some things can't be um if they can<br>be explained they can be done so in ways<br>which are um still interesting to people<br>who know a lot about the subject but<br>they're also very accessible to people<br>who<br>don't the next thing is we have to try<br>to reframe this um very dysfunctional<br>debate um by um uh by shifting some of<br>those the political process away from um<br>its power as a force of denial and<br>inaction um into a driver of real<br>positive change and progress and I<br>believe that's only going to happen if<br>we develop um very strong Grassroots<br>response to climate change so people can<br>feel practical they're they're doing<br>something useful to improve their life<br>make this infimal change um because it's<br>not the point that their change that<br>they might make has any impact because<br>it is in infal but the point the real<br>point is the fact they are trying to<br>make a change um is the real is is the<br>real benefit and um so um once we got<br>that Grassroots response we could um<br>really push politicians locally and then<br>nationally to embolden them to go out<br>and try and do<br>more and um finally we have to find ways<br>to make Collective action rewarding and<br>that's essentially what um the likes of<br>an emissions trading scheme um or an<br>international climate framework um are<br>meant to do and we're still struggling<br>to um conceive of and to execute<br>incredibly complicated um sort of<br>intellectual constructs about how those<br>might work um because we we're dealing<br>in you know vastly unexplored territory<br>um but I believe we<br>can but I also believe personally that<br>we need to show um the way to some kind<br>of Sunny Uplands of success here rather<br>than threaten everyone with the dark<br>chasms of failure<br>in sooner probably rather than later we<br>will need to do the latter if inaction<br>persists um but I would still uh really<br>hope that we could at least make a start<br>um by offering that sense that there is<br>um a better life out there um for us all<br>so in response to the the priming um<br>examples that um Andrew um posed um I<br>think that if we get off more likely<br>here than in many other countries and<br>the climate modeling suggests we will<br>you know we're not going to have the<br>temperature extremes of the equatorial<br>areas or the drought um but but if we<br>did that of course many people I suspect<br>would um not feel guilty about that at<br>all they would be glad that they're here<br>um perhaps even being to the point of<br>being quite smug about being God's Own<br>though of course at that point um God<br>might have disowned us by then um so it<br>might be God's<br>disown secondly uh the question was what<br>impacts might um leaving a challenging<br>Legacy of for future Generations have on<br>us here and again I suspect that the way<br>things are at the moment most people<br>might feel vaguely badly about that but<br>it would fall into the same sort of<br>category as famine in the third world<br>look you know we're really sorry about<br>that but these are forces far beyond us<br>and you know we sent off a bit of money<br>to the missionaries or oxan but that's<br>probably about the best we can do heck<br>we even put a heart tax on our<br>cows um thirdly the question was if we<br>took a leading role internationally how<br>would that make us feel about ourselves<br>well we do have a track record there we<br>were in San Francisco um after the<br>second world war bringing real<br>intellectual horsepower um to the debate<br>about what should the United Nations<br>look like um and we've continued to play<br>roles like that whether in the U General<br>agreement on trade and tffs and trade<br>Gat or its successor the World Trade<br>Organization or now in United Nations<br>climate change negotiations so um it's<br>no um surprise that the current chairman<br>of the Kyoto Protocol is a New Zealand<br>Diplomat um Adrien<br>Macy um but I want to throw up a real um<br>Paradox about leadership and and it<br>comes down essentially to this back in<br>the 1980s uh we locked onto the cause of<br>nuclear free with great alacrity speed<br>and um enus Effectiveness we were proud<br>of Last Stand and it helped us to um<br>shape our sense of who we were now<br>carbon free should be even more<br>galvanizing but it isn't and it isn't<br>because it actually requires us to do<br>something um actually albeit I would<br>argue positive things whereas of course<br>nuclear free simply required us to say<br>no and if that made the Americans angry<br>at us that's even better um who wanted<br>to identify with those ugly bastards<br>anyway um particularly so soon after the<br>the Vietnam War um so that nuclear free<br>versus carbon free contrast um actually<br>gets a great deal more a great deal<br>Starker when you look at it more closely<br>because n our nuclear-free response was<br>to a threat that would have indeed been<br>utterly cataclysmic if nuclear Holocaust<br>had eventuated but the risks of it<br>happening were very long indeed or at<br>least they now seem so in historic<br>hindsight carbon free though should be<br>our response to cataclysmic consequences<br>which are already starting to unfold the<br>cost of doing nothing human Financial<br>material spiritual is going to be<br>enormous the cost of doing something<br>useful is actually small that's what the<br>stern report and others tell us um and<br>yet it's really hard to um um engage<br>people in that way we still won't act<br>how am I doing TimeWise I'm not paying<br>attention okay good just um give you a<br>couple of examples of the really uh<br>wonky thinking um first of all it's the<br>um example of Philip grean and the wine<br>Institute the problem with the wine<br>industry in New Zealand is not an<br>inability to produce a volume of wine um<br>it's an inability to produce enough<br>value from each bottle of wine um so um<br>there was a time until the global<br>financial crisis where wine in New<br>Zealand New Zealand wine sold in the UK<br>was per bottle average the most<br>expensive imported wine even more<br>expensive than French wine French<br>incredibly expensive wines but very<br>cheap wines so on average New Zealand<br>wine was the most expensive imported<br>wine um but since then um our um wine<br>industry has substantially trashed the<br>brand so you can now buy sort of three<br>liter plastic bladders of sovon Blanc um<br>I use the word bladder deliberately um<br>in UK supermarkets um so the problem is<br>not trying to produce more wine there<br>will always be people around the world<br>who produce more wine cheaper than us so<br>climate change doesn't change that at<br>all and I just have this life-size<br>picture of us being very insensitive of<br>perhaps a TV commercial in Europe for<br>New Zealand wine some decades hence of<br>perhaps a former all black who's known<br>now more for being a character Than<br>People vaguely remember about his rugby<br>but anyway fronting up to a withered<br>French Vine oh saying mate you know I'm<br>really gutted that you know somebody's<br>rooted your Vines but look here's<br>something to cheer you up a 2 L bottle<br>of New Zealand wine only $350 Euro well<br>you know I don't think that's quite um<br>how we would need to respond um secondly<br>B shadbolt in in in viago um it's going<br>to take more uh work for in viago than<br>simply a 3 Dee rise in<br>temperature um to make it a thriving<br>Metropolis of the South now I love I'm<br>actually down often in inag and I'm not<br>being rude about inag I'm a huge fan of<br>the um um Southern Southern Institute of<br>Technology and such people um but um<br>that is an an amazingly idiotic response<br>by Tim shadal um because um in Carle is<br>very very low line um and um temp sea<br>level rises are really important I'll<br>end very briefly can I still go on a few<br>more minutes five thanks um sorry thanks<br>for timekeeping I was worried about<br>wanting to say far too much let me go<br>back to the um the spiritual um<br>questions um<br>I like to use the example of um say a<br>tree um a tree uh absorbs water and<br>minerals from the ground and carbon<br>dioxide from the air it uses sunlight to<br>turn those into the building blocks of<br>life and it lives for hundreds of years<br>it cleans the air it gives shade and<br>habitat to plentiful life forms it is<br>self-cleaning self-repairing self-<br>reproducing dying it nurtures the soil<br>ah it also happens to be beautiful in<br>inspiring lovers artists poets and even<br>some of the less sensitive Among Us it<br>comes in a profusions of models and<br>varieties each brilliantly adapted to<br>its climate and terrain there is nothing<br>we humans have yet devised that comes<br>anywhere close to the cleverness<br>complexity and functionality and form of<br>a tree um so it seems to be that if you<br>don't have any sense of wonder about<br>that tree if you don't have any kind of<br>spiritual relationship with that tree uh<br>you are deep ly impoverished um and um<br>you and your community um are the worst<br>for it now we Christians are not very<br>helpful on this um our theology has<br>tended to revolve around um dominance<br>that God created us um so we could be in<br>charge of um stuff on Earth um or<br>stewardship we would kind of look after<br>stuff on Earth well those are both<br>deeply flawed um even the stewardship<br>one which is more benign um the sheer<br>complexity of nature um and life on the<br>planet is something that far transcends<br>human's ability to control or manage it<br>we talk about saving the planet um but<br>we'll actually only finish ourselves off<br>the planet will go on for billions of<br>years yet and different life forms will<br>evolve um because that's the nature of<br>the planet the planet is far more robust<br>than we are now like theologians I like<br>to try to explain the inexplicable say<br>as I'm a journalist so journalist so I'm<br>not but I'm going to be cautious about<br>trying to um suggest new theology other<br>than um uh very core Mari Concepts like<br>katanga are incredibly important because<br>they see um people as part of the<br>ecosystem and therefore what people do<br>um is an interaction with the ecosystem<br>um um we we become part of that<br>ecosystem so for me any kind of Theology<br>and any kind of climate change or<br>spiritual response um has to revolve<br>around that one last thought um in ter<br>terms of what might be our distinctive<br>contribution to this um in um the<br>Anglican Church worldwide um in late um<br>November we're starting to celebrate<br>more often um the Feast of Christ and<br>all creation um and I and starting to<br>focus on these um issues of ecosystems<br>and our relationships to them I find it<br>incredibly interesting that it is very<br>easy for all the great faiths of the<br>world to come together in the Interfaith<br>Dialogue on climate change to offer very<br>coherent views at Copenhagen they will<br>be back in Durban next month this year's<br>un climate change negotiations offering<br>a very coherent very consistent picture<br>drawing on all of those faiths and where<br>religion so often divides us or um<br>causes Wars or other great uh disasters<br>um I really believe that um a common<br>cause through um faith and spirituality<br>uh around the environment uh would<br>actually do wonders uh not only for the<br>environment but human relationships one<br>last thing about Christ and uh and the<br>Feast of Christ and all creation and of<br>course that was something really pushed<br>by the Archbishop of Canterbury up in<br>the Northern Hemisphere and ran Williams<br>has said marvelous things like we are<br>consumers of what God has made we are in<br>communion with it but of course it's<br>November it's a horrible time of year in<br>the UK I mean that's one of the reasons<br>I live live here um and um um and it's<br>about keeping what you have sown at that<br>time of the year well of course um and<br>that's probably appropriate for how<br>we've screwed up um the planet so far um<br>but of course here November is spring<br>it's um the season of new plantings of<br>New Hope so for us as we C celebrate the<br>Christ of the Feast of Christ and all<br>creation here in New Zealand in Spring<br>um I hope we think of it U not just as a<br>a religious a spiritual theological<br>exercise um but we are trying to um uh<br>create ideas real part of the creativity<br>to take out to the world um to help um<br>us work on these um otherwise<br>you thank you very much for the<br>opportunity to talk to you tonight about<br>um climate change it's somewhat out of<br>my ear of expertise but I will do my<br>best to link what I do know with what I<br>don't know here tonight um the ethical<br>framework that I want to propose to you<br>is that of the golden rule do unto<br>others as you would have done unto<br>yourself and in the Christian tradition<br>of course um Jesus instruction um for<br>those without sin to cast the first<br>stone is is but one reflection of that<br>in modern times um I'm particularly<br>attracted to the um uh people with<br>disabilities slogan nothing about us<br>without us which seems to to me to also<br>follow in that fine tradition and I<br>think this idea of connectedness is is<br>very important in the climate change<br>debate and I want to offer you um<br>thoughts from two notable um folk first<br>of all Elizabeth Warren who's a uh<br>United States politician particularly<br>interested in consumer protection who<br>recently<br>said there is nobody in this country who<br>got rich on his own you built a factory<br>out there good for you but I want to be<br>clear you moved your goods to Market on<br>the roads the rest of us paid for you<br>hired your workers the rest of us paid<br>to educate you were safe in your factory<br>because of police forces and fire forces<br>that the rest of us paid for you didn't<br>have to worry that marauding bands would<br>come and seize everything at your<br>factory and hire someone to protect<br>against this because the work the rest<br>of us<br>did now look you built a factory and<br>turned it into something terrific<br>God bless keep a big hunk of it but a<br>part of the underlying social contract<br>is you take a hunk of that and you pay<br>it forward for the next kid who comes<br>along of course the thing she neglects<br>to mention of course is they got rich<br>because other people paid for the goods<br>that factory produced and they tended to<br>people be people who were a lot less<br>Rich than those who owned the<br>factory the other person I'd like to<br>talk to you about is Robert putam who's<br>a researcher in the field field of<br>Social connectedness and social justice<br>who says that the strongest predictor of<br>crime rates is social capital and crime<br>is lower in communities in which there<br>is a high level of connectedness he also<br>says that as a rule of thumb if you<br>belong to no group but decide to join<br>one you cut your risk of dying over the<br>next year and a half if you smoke and<br>belong to no group it's a toss up<br>statistically whether you should stop<br>smoking or start joining<br>and so it's really clear that human<br>beings uh need connection yes that it's<br>not just an ethical position but it's a<br>biological position um practically we<br>cannot literally cannot function without<br>other people morally we should not try<br>to do<br>so so of course and inevitably we get<br>the argument the end about individualism<br>and that I don't want to be Shackled to<br>somebody else and we shouldn't all<br>operate at the level of the lowest<br>common denominator which is the great<br>fear of the collective and I don't<br>really think that that's a concern<br>because one of the other biological<br>factors attached to human beings is that<br>we adapt very very well to short-term<br>circumstance there's a distinct<br>evolutionary advantage to this of course<br>you you get your bad berries your<br>dangerous cliff and your frightening<br>tiger you you want to learn the first<br>time around that these are these are<br>things to be avoided yes um but it does<br>mean of course that our decision making<br>is predicated on short-term Focus<br>points and unfortunately short-term<br>Frameworks tend to be quite<br>selfish they're about my interests<br>that's all I've got time to think about<br>that's what I react to the group's<br>interests take<br>longer so that whilst whilst we are<br>needful of each other it is a loose<br>connection not a tight connection we're<br>not ants or termites but we are social<br>creatures and we'll come back to this<br>idea that selfishness has a short<br>turning Circle in a few<br>minutes so the challenge lies not<br>whether we are Shackled to each other<br>and will operate at the level of the<br>lowest common denominator because that's<br>not going to happen the challenge is<br>whether we'll invite others to share the<br>life preserver when it gets<br>thrown planting out the vines Andrew<br>asked us to consider the ethical<br>considerations of intergenerational<br>responsibilities of richer country have<br>responsibilities to poor countries<br>developed countries because we started<br>polluting first and and I confess this<br>is a little more globally conceptual<br>than I'm I'm used to so so I thought as<br>a way of sidling up to this I might try<br>and shrink it and get very very local<br>indeed and see what that might tell me<br>and possibly you about this debate so I<br>want to talk about South Eden because in<br>many ways the way that the comfortable<br>middle classes and deden think about<br>South deden is the way we we all think<br>about<br>overseas yes the most frequently<br>mentioned impacts of climate change are<br>more extreme weather events sea level<br>rise generalized warming of the mean<br>temperature and considerable<br>consequential changes to Flora and fora<br>increased desertification I'm not sure<br>I'm saying that right more sand less<br>trees so I'm going to pick one because<br>I'm trying to shrink this down into<br>something I can cope with and I'm going<br>to pick sea level rise and I'd like to<br>give you some local sea level statistics<br>about South denen well about about denen<br>as a whole but mostly South deden for<br>every 10 cm the mean sea level goes<br>up groundw goes up 9 cm and we<br>understand that mean sea level is the<br>bit between high tide and low tide yes<br>so it's it's not it's not the highest<br>the sea get current predictions are for<br>an average 1 cmet a year rise in the<br>mean sea level in the coast round denan<br>in South denan the water table is as<br>little as 25 to 40 cm under the<br>sod DCC is already pumping out salt<br>water at high<br>tide most of the houses in South deden<br>piles and the treny of children in the<br>Northeast Valley of denan can be<br>predicted on which side of the valley<br>they live on yes if you live on the<br>western side of the valley you only get<br>Morning Sun and your chances of having a<br>respiratory illness are that much higher<br>than if you live on the Eastern side<br>which gets after afternoon sun treny of<br>children in the Northeast Valley is<br>predicated on on which side of the<br>valley they live on there is an<br>immediate health impact that impacts on<br>their<br>lifelong experience primary school<br>education is absolutely critical to life<br>Performance Based on how damp their<br>houses<br>are I urge you to consider the<br>conjunction of these FS so it must be<br>obviously if you live in South needing<br>time to move fairly soon yes<br>but you<br>can't southon Eden is the second most<br>socially deprived urban area in the<br>South Island typically this means low<br>income low level of Education low access<br>to public transport low home ownership<br>poor health outcomes poor crime rates<br>all of all of those happy stories and<br>it's true in southon Eden 60% of<br>households have a total income of less<br>than $20,000<br>perom more than 60% of residents a over<br>15 are reliant on some form of income<br>support nearly 40% have no personal<br>vehicle three quarters have either never<br>married or now separated divorced or<br>widowed and only a third own their own<br>home so there's some consequences that<br>we can draw from this<br>information and they go like this it<br>would be unwise to assume that many of<br>those living in South deden are aware of<br>change possibly ignorant of of of of<br>climate change altogether never mind the<br>impact on them personally it would not<br>be wise to assume that they are<br>interested many will see themselves as<br>transitory or confused some are outside<br>of the system or believe that due to<br>their remaining life expectancy it won't<br>impact upon them they will not access<br>information about this in the same way<br>that connected and it's called um uh<br>cultivated or concerned cultivation<br>societies such as the middle class will<br>renters will generally assume that they<br>can relocate easily but of course it's<br>not possible for them all to do it at<br>once um because there is no<br>infrastructure to absorb them and if<br>anything Christ Church should have<br>taught us<br>that landlords will have no incentive to<br>keep their assets and good repair<br>because who are they going to sell them<br>to the economic argument for a landlord<br>is to let the asset run<br>down for those who do own the value of<br>their hard paid off asset will diminish<br>just as the cost of replacement stock<br>increases and if their house is their<br>savings they will not be able to buy<br>anything many older people of course<br>hold on to their housing in order to<br>have something to leave to Future<br>generations and it will make them<br>stubborn in the face of a threat to that<br>asset and for many of them southen is an<br>attractive place to live because the<br>features there suit the residence it's<br>on the flat you can get around on a<br>Mobility scooter you can mow down<br>hardworking Social Service workers on<br>your Mobility Scooter yes Denon doesn't<br>have a lot of other flat land what it<br>does have on the Tyre is at the same<br>mean height above sea level yes um so<br>where are we going to relocate them<br>to we know from endless initiatives to<br>engage with homelessness that simply<br>relocating folks doesn't work you<br>destroy what's left of their social<br>Fabric and the Rel recre ation of<br>ghettos as in the British housing estate<br>of the 60s is equally<br>problematic so that's South Eden I've<br>got a good grip on that I can probably<br>scale it up a wee bit now let's think<br>about sea level change it's just sea<br>level change is one of the host of of<br>outcomes of climate change and start<br>thinking about well not just the<br>Maldives but the<br>Netherlands<br>Louisiana manaco up north lower Hut<br>Bangladesh Mexico most of the Pacific<br>Islands and infant anywhere with a<br>coast it's not just going to be<br>us so what we can see is this if we<br>scale it up those lessons from South Den<br>Eden are the most affected are likely to<br>be the most<br>ignorant they will respond late and they<br>will have few if any Resources with<br>which to<br>respond the market will not deliver a<br>solution living conditions may actually<br>worsen as governments are unable to<br>finance the sustaining of necessary<br>infrastructure<br>and additional social problems will<br>arise as populations<br>move there will be hidden social costs<br>in the affected communities that will<br>play out over decades and the problem is<br>here<br>now so I'm going to tempt you with the<br>golden rule<br>again but then I'm going to remember<br>that we've all got a short turning<br>self-interest and so instead of thinking<br>about doing unto others as we would have<br>done unto us instead I ask you to<br>remember Elizabeth Warren<br>those who get and stay rich and we are a<br>supposedly rich country do so by having<br>others who buy our Goods work in our<br>factories pay our taxes that provide our<br>infrastructure to move our Goods around<br>and provide security for our plant and<br>goods and I ask you to remember that New<br>Zealand is an export-led primary<br>producing<br>economy our quality of life even in<br>South deden is dependent on folks<br>elsewhere<br>so this is a very very small world and<br>to par to paraphrase the disabled<br>people's<br>slogan the ethic right now is that it is<br>about all of us right now thank<br>you okay the question is um of the panel<br>um what are their perspectives on um<br>obligations to our Pacific neighbors who<br>are will be facing potentially forced<br>relocations um yes well we have the<br>largest Pacific island um communities in<br>the globe ockland is the largest Pacific<br>island urban center I think absolutely<br>um there's only<br>170,000 people we're looking at we we<br>understand the culture so I<br>think uh this is the place to go and<br>Helen Clark when she was prime minister<br>when approached by the prime minister of<br>TUV Val Lucid of course yet good old<br>Johnny H said no way so the I think um<br>brothers I would uh I absolutely endorse<br>that too I would extend it slightly<br>wider though um although the um the<br>number of people theoretically um are we<br>could handle in large part um just by<br>bringing them to New Zealand that maybe<br>not what they want to do because even so<br>Northland isn't necessarily particularly<br>attractive to them um so<br>um they it may be a question of helping<br>them move somewhere else um and um if<br>that's the case we should very much be<br>their Advocates and work with them um to<br>get the international support they need<br>so um I I I would love to see New<br>Zealand playing that that that wider<br>cases I I couldn't agree with with Rod<br>and Jim Moore I think they're absolutely<br>right I think there's a the the the<br>leadership opportunity and a friendship<br>opportunity and New Zealand has<br>considerable resources uh including our<br>political Connections in our<br>International standing to offer in<br>support of the solutions that the people<br>of those islands<br>uh should should be asked to to help<br>identify or or or suggest themselves<br>it's about their lives it's not for us<br>just to decide for them the question for<br>the for the AV is what what what is the<br>time frame involved in some of the<br>changes well the current sea level rise<br>estimates um the new estimates uh<br>between 50 and 160 cm by 2100 so if you<br>take the mid-range that's a meter by<br>2100 obviously it accelerates as you<br>approach 2100 so probably in terms of<br>serious<br>stuff for uh 2050 is probably when we<br>need to take<br>action and is that when we need to take<br>action on both fronts as as the question<br>uh questioner asked uh yes well now even<br>now tuu for example or kurbas you go<br>there there at King tides<br>um basements of houses are starting to<br>get flooded and certainly the<br>salinization of the atol so in a sense<br>time is very much running out for the<br>Pacific<br>Islands I mean my thought on that would<br>be that um unless we want to pay chicken<br>with Destiny now for all of them is is<br>is is the urgency but I take Rod's point<br>and I think he actually made it at a at<br>a previous presentation when the great<br>unlimited resource that human beings<br>have is our imagination and I I take his<br>point tonight that I think there is<br>considerable opportunity involved in in<br>all the change that's going to have to<br>result and and whether we see it as<br>opportunity or we we see it as sort of<br>um coping with problems really depends<br>largely on our mindset and what what we<br>think we can learn and I think already<br>we're seeing people learning a great<br>deal out of the Christ Church<br>earthquakes that that will have<br>long-term benefit There's an opportunity<br>here for us to look at South deden<br>tuvalu and and look at brokering new<br>technologies be they soft or hard as as<br>we move through it um you know I think<br>that the human race has always faced<br>great<br>challenges this happens to be the great<br>challenge we're facing now and out of<br>all of those great challenges we've seen<br>considerable opportunity for imagination<br>creativity and<br>Advance thanks<br>um but just to make sure we're not um<br>relaxed about this um it's whilst the<br>impact is some decades away we actually<br>need to make all sorts of decisions now<br>um based on the precaution that we are<br>expecting this to happen so for example<br>Christ Church city council is working on<br>a rebuild of the city factoring only a<br>half a meter rise in sea level uh that's<br>pretty um irresponsible because they'd<br>be making all sorts of decisions in<br>Christ Church with very very long<br>effects um and they should be planning<br>on a meter at least now that that won't<br>protect Christ Church when sea level<br>should it go this way end up being five<br>or seven meters um but but at least you<br>wouldn't be wasting resource at the at<br>the you know it's be money well spent<br>now because the cost preparing for a<br>meter now um is is minimal um versus<br>preparing for half a meter but you've<br>decision right the question question is<br>um what's the role of short-term<br>economic thinking in in in the political<br>response um I actually don't think there<br>is a um a problem with short-term<br>economics um it's only the way we're<br>using economics um and um there are<br>completely rational economic Arguments<br>for um believing knowing that fossil<br>fuels or let's deal with oil um will um<br>be heading 100 you know beyond $150 a<br>barrel<br>um and the um the need to move on to<br>other forms of energy which certainly<br>have climate benefits by not being<br>carbon based um make plain economic<br>sense so um the economics actually Stack<br>Up Now the the only thing that's not<br>working at the moment is short-term<br>understanding um so this is a failure of<br>humans not of Economics which I I'm not<br>sure I want to debate that issue but um<br>so don't blame economics just um blame<br>and I I'm not an economist but blame the<br>people trying to use the economics um as<br>an excuse for not doing<br>something and I think here this is the<br>understanding of Economics where it<br>hasn't costed in the environment and uh<br>Lord ni sterer said that has been the<br>biggest market failure um we've seen in<br>the 20th century so um and that really<br>thinking<br>yes ask see you're close I will give you<br>this a question about the our perception<br>of risk we focused on disasters as we<br>usually do as humans um are there other<br>things for instance changes in um global<br>climate mean wipe out of harvest in in<br>Russia Across America and the drop in<br>production of um basic um stop for the<br>industrial process which will affect our<br>trade much on a great much greater scale<br>um all sorts of other resource impacts<br>impact on on transport with um more<br>storms and cost of availability those<br>things are those the biggest elements we<br>should be concentrating on rather than<br>the um catastrophes which happen such as<br>in Christ Church and other ones that<br>will happen with some fast localized<br>places what's the context here what are<br>the bigger risks for New Zealand are the<br>reaction to climate change from other<br>countries forcing us to change the<br>reaction to the overall climate um<br>resource picture or our own individual<br>responses saying inago or whatever will<br>picture well I I'll I'll just color in a<br>bit of global picture and the biggest<br>impacts of the Arctic and and once that<br>goes this is the melting of sea ice and<br>the melting of the tundra and you<br>release a whole lot of methane and that<br>the critical levels about 1 to 2 degrees<br>we're almost the Asian Mega delers have<br>been talked about and there's lots of<br>millions of vulnerable people Coral at<br>all<br>islands and basically Africa which is<br>subsistence living drying out but<br>um yes we're in the world so and we're<br>at the bottom um so things are going to<br>Tumble on onto us um and it's really<br>hard<br>to Fathom how they'll tumble out but<br>it's basically a long slow burn it's<br>like<br>droughts people don't realize droughts<br>creep up on you and suddenly you're they<br>there so that's what we're dealing with<br>and we've got to get out of short-term<br>thinking<br>actually thanks<br>um I think that the least of the risks<br>that you identify there um is the one<br>around markets um where issues have<br>already Arisen like the uh very um<br>spurious uh food miles debate because<br>it's not an issue of how far the food<br>travels um if it um is produced very<br>efficiently pasture based rather than<br>feed lot based for example US versus<br>Europe um and um it travels by ship um<br>there is no that is very sustainable<br>food production and we can respond to<br>those sorts of Market issues the um by<br>by far the overwhelming um biggest<br>threat is one that um we would all share<br>in the world which is those sorts of um<br>very major climate change um impacts<br>that Jim's um<br>enumerating um but I think there's um a<br>a much nearer term impact um and it<br>looks like this we have an economic<br>model at the moment which is is um has<br>hit the wall in terms of how we earn a<br>living in the world um you know we can't<br>go on being a commodity producer you<br>know we we're hardly lifting exports<br>even though this is the best terms of<br>trade we've had in 37 years and our two<br>largest trading partners the fastest<br>growing developed country Australia and<br>the fastest growing developing country<br>and yet you know we're hardly shifting<br>exports so uh we've got a fundamental<br>problem um economically socially<br>environmentally with how we earn a<br>living<br>so in the short to medium term I.E from<br>now out over the next 10 15 years um I<br>argue very passionately we could um<br>significantly reorient what we're doing<br>we' still be big farmers um and all the<br>rest but we would reorient what we were<br>doing so we would be starting to build<br>in some true sustainability to how we<br>earn the living um and so for me the<br>shortterm impact five to 15 say from now<br>to years the the real point is that if<br>we don't move on that if we don't start<br>playing to these enormous shifts um of<br>global values and um Trends and all the<br>rest and we try to keep banging our head<br>against the wall with our current<br>economic model um we're in we'll be in<br>serious trouble so for me that's the<br>most immediate risk and and the way out<br>of that is to um start building a<br>different economy um that um brings<br>strong sustainability right to its heart<br>rather than just kind of a a spurious<br>bit of weak sustainability to um keep<br>people slightly<br>happier do you mean<br>self um no um because um we could never<br>be SE self-sufficient here in New<br>Zealand we could certainly produce all<br>the food we need um but we aren't going<br>to produce um drugs or computers or<br>aircraft or all sorts of other stuff so<br>so we need to be um you know connected<br>globally I also want to make a very big<br>Distinction on growth between good<br>growth and bad growth and bad growth is<br>that which is is rampant and has all<br>sorts of environmental social all sorts<br>of other impacts which is um or uses<br>resources in very unsustainable ways um<br>um I believe it's po I I believe that<br>good growth is not sorry this is rather<br>complicated good growth is not an<br>oxymoron and we actually need growth um<br>because there are already seven billion<br>people people on the planet many of whom<br>are not um properly fed or housed and<br>we're heading for 10 or 11 billion by<br>sort of 2050 and the only way that so<br>many people are going to live well on<br>this planet is by very radically<br>changing um the economics the technology<br>the values the systems by how we do that<br>you know humankind's got to make changes<br>of a scale and speed that dwarfs<br>anything he's ever done before um so<br>that's that's about true sustainability<br>uh rather than um thinking narrowly we<br>can just hunker down well we could but<br>life I I think the single um biggest<br>potential crisis facing us is the<br>political one and whilst have no<br>expertise to debate this on the economic<br>model may be working fine I'm not sure<br>that that the political model is working<br>fine in that um if we continue to have<br>short-term political decision making<br>and um retrenchment of initiatives that<br>are supposed to bring um us into our<br>responsibilities around climate change<br>then we're going to wind up having it<br>happen to us and there are already<br>people starting to scare Monger about<br>the kind of anticipated international<br>migration pressures that climate change<br>will bring and what will happen to New<br>Zealand if if we leave it to the last<br>minute we'll be steering down the barrel<br>of choices around politicians who either<br>don't have a clue or who are reacting<br>very very poorly to a whole set of<br>circumstan that it is now far too late<br>to do anything constructive about and<br>and those are situations where everybody<br>loses out quite<br>considerably think of Greece at the<br>moment question is is what are the<br>opportunities for motivating um lower<br>socio economic um groups to take action<br>relating to climate change on their own<br>lives and to do with their property um<br>the short answer is gosh I wish I<br>knew um the long answer is is I think<br>that one of the things that's happened<br>whilst people in my age group haven't<br>quite noticed it over the last 30 years<br>certainly since um probably the 88 labor<br>government is there has been a real<br>tearing at the fabric of New Zealand<br>society and a lot of the people you<br>speak of don't have any property and<br>many of them don't feel they have quite<br>the complement of rights that the rest<br>of<br>do um we're looking again at a very<br>micro level at South Eden roughly half<br>the people who live there have lived<br>there for more than 10 years and they<br>tend to be older retired and the other<br>half have lived there for less than a<br>year there there isn't a sense of<br>neighborhood they don't talk to each<br>other information doesn't move around<br>there is no connection out of which a<br>movement can be born and I think that um<br>you know South and Eden would be in the<br>sort of top top 10 um exceptional<br>communities for that level of<br>disadvantage and social dislocation<br>however they're not unusual in New<br>Zealand the protest movements of the 80s<br>seem to have been lost in the kind of<br>materialism and individualism we've now<br>gotten all U fairly well Stu with um and<br>and certainly agencies like mine work<br>very hard on the kind of community<br>building and Community organizing that<br>you speak of but we do it in an<br>environment of funding cuts and<br>increased complexity so it's it's a very<br>difficult question but I think it's a<br>really good question to ask because the<br>moment we ask that question we take some<br>responsibility for trying to find an<br>answer and that's I think the first step<br>towards what you're asking about<br>beginning to<br>occur I will talk about an ancient<br>solution and it's in<br>Genesis and it's the departure of<br>the Hebrews from Egypt and what was very<br>interesting about all that it was<br>decided that the people that had been<br>enslaved should not um return to Israel<br>and they shouldn't be the ones that<br>colonize and set things up because the<br>older people were too set in their ways<br>and really the whole idea of wandering<br>around the desert was to have a new<br>generation and<br>um I you you could yeah no no this this<br>is anyway um I'll develop this further<br>in South Oakland which I'm more familiar<br>with and that uh colleagues of mine have<br>been working on educating people in the<br>primary schools and the Des one and two<br>schools because then they take the<br>message home to their parents and that's<br>basically where we have to Target and um<br>uh A friend of mine has convinced me of<br>that forget about the desr 9 or 10<br>schools go to the desr one or two<br>schools in manaca and maybe South deden<br>and get it to the primary school kids<br>parents um absolutely believe it's ESS<br>essential to um build communities that<br>way um and so I'm a great fan of for<br>example of the transition Town movement<br>I I would have serious um um different<br>views about engagement with the world<br>economy in that sense whereas that that<br>that's not their thing at all but that<br>um building of community by doing things<br>together um by you know creating some<br>collective Goods like Community Gardens<br>and the rest I think incredibly<br>important so you could start to you know<br>build community that way and<br>and yes it you you wouldn't be saying to<br>them you know we're we're off on a<br>journey here to save you all from<br>climate change um you just be trying to<br>give them a hand to lift themselves<br>overall um and so we start to create<br>those communities that um can respond<br>far quickly to all these um challenges<br>and communities where we can start<br>moving at say the speed of the fastest<br>third um with courage um but also with<br>compassion to help along on the journey<br>um everybody else who's finding it<br>rather frightening or threatening so<br>that's the sort of community I would<br>imagine okay we've got space for one<br>complicated question or two simple<br>questions just repeating that what the<br>key questions to be asked I presume of<br>politicians um was that the idea yes<br>during the election<br>campaign um for me there's a litmus test<br>um which is whether a politician sees um<br>the relationship between environment and<br>economy as a tradeoff um the current<br>government talks of balance between the<br>two um or whether they see the<br>environment I.E the ecosystem overall um<br>actually as the only economy we have um<br>and understanding that we can um restore<br>the ecosystem at the same time as build<br>our economy if we go for good growth<br>that is sympathetic to all that um so<br>for me that's always the litmus test um<br>and that's all I need to ask in one<br>sense uh well a lot more flows from that<br>but for me that's the litmus<br>test uh for me I guess it's more basic<br>that we've just got to stop<br>emitting carbon dioxide into the<br>atmosphere and really keeping coal in<br>the ground and that's the big one<br>including liite yes oh definitely liite<br>but keeping coal in the ground I grew up<br>here I can remember at school we were<br>taught never to use liite and this was<br>in the 1960s it was very dirty<br>stuff um I'm slightly more of a radical<br>and I know I know that politicians<br>respond to what they think the voting<br>public want and so my recommendation<br>would be um don't worry about asking so<br>much but concentrate on telling this is<br>know R rumor has it that that that that<br>the labor party when in government used<br>to poll at least once a week and the<br>national party has taken that to extreme<br>and now poll most<br>nights um and very very evidently all<br>you have to do is watch 6:00 news<br>evidently deeply responsive to public<br>sentiment I think the challenge here is<br>to educate ourselves so that our<br>politicians will follow us yes not not<br>wait for them to lead they're too<br>frightened of being voted out um by<br>those who do have the very short turning<br>circle of selfishness deep in their<br>heart so I I think that's the challenge<br>here and we may not have enough time for<br>this election unfortunately but I think<br>unfortunately that takes us to within 2<br>minutes of our finish time and and these<br>people have to catch or two of them at<br>least I believe have to catch airplanes<br>um thus emitting a little bit of carbon<br>dioxide into the atmosphere but I'm sure<br>their good works are making up for that<br>very very warm thanks to to Rod to Jim<br>and to Laura for their very very<br>thought-provoking presentations tonight<br>um I think I think what they're offering<br>us are some really important some<br>critical insights into how climate<br>change is not just a physical exercise<br>it's not just something that is going to<br>be economically alarming to us all um<br>but it's something that we must think<br>about very deeply in terms of our our<br>Spiritual Beings and our ethical<br>positioning of ourselves um and for our<br>grandchildren ahead of us um so thank<br>you very much um you three you've really<br>um got the debate going and I hope we<br>have many more events like this Koda<br>ask</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
