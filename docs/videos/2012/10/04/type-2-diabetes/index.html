Director of the Liggins Institute Professor Wayne Cutfield and Health Sciences student Hannah Burgess talk about why people need to be more aware of the symptoms and take action before it's too late.<br><br>Find out more about the Liggins Institute: http://www.liggins.auckland.ac.nz<br>Find out more about LENScience - bringing students and scientists together: http://www.lenscience.auckland.ac.nz</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;
