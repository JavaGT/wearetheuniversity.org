<br><br>With just one Powerpoint slide and the clock counting down, each of the nine finalist had three minutes to communicate their PhD research to the audience and the judges in an engaging and easy to understand manner, using only one slide. <br><br>Could you explain a doctoral research project to your granny, a journalist or your old schoolmates in three minutes or less?<br><br>Find out about a

font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>and welcome to this event<br>this is the 2012 final of the<br>three-minute thesis competition or 3mt<br>as we call it this is the fourth year<br>that we've run this event<br>and i trust it will be as informative<br>and entertaining as usual<br>i'm rachel spronken-smith the acting<br>director of graduate research services<br>and we<br>oversee this event a special welcome to<br>our local schools<br>they will be instrumental in determining<br>the school's prize to the presenter that<br>they think<br>is the best and because we have our<br>schools here just a little word of<br>background really on<br>what it is that these students are doing<br>in terms of a thesis<br>when you embark on university study you<br>generally start off in a three-year<br>bachelor's degree<br>some people may opt to do an extra year<br>an honours year<br>and following that could be a two-year<br>master's thesis<br>which has one year of coursework and one<br>thesis year where people<br>undertake research on a topic of<br>interest<br>now if you get through all that you can<br>then go on to a doctorate or phd<br>so people can go there from either an<br>honours or a master's degree<br>the phd is three years of full-time<br>study<br>where students are following a research<br>that they're truly passionate about<br>we hope and and then they after that<br>they come out with<br>a doctorate or a phd when you do that<br>you get to wear a fancy gown like this<br>one<br>so mine came from the university of<br>british columbia in vancouver<br>this year we've had many entrants across<br>the divisions in the university<br>and today we're going to hear from nine<br>finalists we had hoped there would be a<br>tenth one but unfortunately due to<br>illness<br>she had to pull out a big thanks to<br>officemax for their generous sponsorship<br>and this is the fourth year running that<br>officemax have sponsored us<br>and uh towards the end of the session<br>today we'll be getting<br>the um two representatives there david<br>bennett the key account manager and<br>murdo ross the account manager<br>to help present prizes now to the rules<br>of the competition<br>each presenter has three minutes to<br>speak<br>and they're only allowed one static<br>slide<br>the presentation should be engaging and<br>pitched at the level of an intelligent<br>lay person<br>it should describe the research but also<br>communicate the enthusiasm and the<br>significance<br>of the work<br>and judging us today we have our panel<br>of judges<br>up here and i'd like to just introduce<br>them in turn<br>first we have our chief judge professor<br>richard is our deputy vice chancellor<br>research and enterprise so he has<br>oversight of research at otago<br>he's a graduate of otago he did an<br>honors degree in science and then went<br>to cambridge and did his doctorate there<br>his research field has applied<br>electromagnetics<br>his principal interests are the<br>development of low-cost nano-scale<br>imaging<br>using near-field light and other<br>sub-wavelength optical phenomena<br>for something lighter and perhaps more<br>easily understood<br>it's rumored that richard is a master of<br>the rubik's cube<br>so he can think fast which is a<br>necessary skill for a 3mt<br>judge our second judge is associate<br>she is in the department of politics she<br>did a bachelor of arts honours degree at<br>canterbury<br>and a phd at victoria university in<br>wellington<br>she's an expert in constitutional<br>politics and the media<br>so maybe she understands sound bites<br>and we gather that with her netballing<br>prowess she's definitely up for a good<br>competition<br>finally we have dr michael stedman<br>michael is our first ever guest judge<br>from outside the university<br>he has an otago university of otago<br>honorary degree<br>of the doctor of laws to recognise his<br>outstanding contribution to film and<br>media in new zealand<br>he's managing director of the natural<br>history new zealand<br>this is the largest producer of wildlife<br>films in the southern hemisphere so<br>we're very fortunate to have him here<br>today<br>and he knows all about the importance of<br>communicating science and research in a<br>what are the judges going to be looking<br>for well a few criteria that we need to<br>keep in mind<br>they're going to look for communication<br>style what's the thesis topic<br>and its significance communicated in a<br>language appropriate<br>to an intelligent but non-specific<br>audience<br>secondly comprehension did the<br>presentation help the audience<br>understand the research<br>and thirdly engagement did the<br>presentation make the audience<br>want to know more now a few other people<br>to introduce<br>firstly and most importantly is actually<br>susan craig here<br>of time keeping this is a very important<br>role<br>she will start the timing when the<br>president when the presenter starts<br>speaking<br>and will hold up a sign indicating when<br>there are 30<br>seconds left so take note our presenters<br>she will hold up another sign when there<br>are 10 seconds left<br>this is the red sign and then she will<br>ring the bell at three<br>minutes presenters must<br>stop talking as soon as they hear the<br>bell or they will be disqualified<br>at the end of the present to each<br>presentation we'll be seeing feedback<br>from the judges and will go in turn<br>to get their views and then most<br>importantly what about the prizes<br>the third place winner will receive 500<br>the second place 750 and the supreme<br>award winner will get a fifteen hundred<br>dollar prize<br>plus there's more a trip to brisbane to<br>compete in the australasian final<br>on october the 11th we also have a<br>school's prize<br>a special 250 prize to the presenter<br>that the school<br>pupils have thought was the best based<br>on their vote<br>what is your role as the audience it's<br>to be very supportive<br>and vocal in your appreciation for these<br>finalists<br>and very importantly we want to hear<br>from you but we don't want to hear your<br>cell phones<br>so if you've got cell phones please make<br>sure that they are switched<br>off all right now we get into the<br>exciting part<br>the presentations as i said we've got<br>nine finalists presenting today<br>we had hoped for a tenth ruth cunningham<br>from the department of public health<br>and wellington was supposed to be here<br>but unfortunately due to illness<br>i will now call upon our first presenter<br>andrew filmer comes to us from the<br>department of music<br>he's an international student from<br>malaysia who's on a prestigious new<br>zealand international doctoral research<br>scholarship<br>he transferred to otago from victoria<br>university<br>and<br>he started here in march this year and<br>his supervisor is associate professor<br>anthony ritchie<br>andrew<br>good afternoon i asked myself recently<br>why i'm doing a phd<br>the robes are fantastic of course and i<br>love this quest<br>for knowledge i think what i really<br>really enjoy is finding out all these<br>things which i've taken for granted<br>in the field of music nothing fits this<br>description<br>better than the tuning of stringed<br>instruments violins and violas and<br>cellos<br>have a standard tuning and where we<br>rarely<br>deviate from this standard tuning it<br>wasn't always this way<br>there's this wonderful lost art of<br>alternative crazy even you know just the<br>most unimaginable tunings you can<br>believe<br>in the 17th century there was a composer<br>who decided that if he could find the<br>most harmonious tuning of his strings<br>he could create music that inspired<br>people to be more spiritual<br>he even tried to do this in a visual way<br>if you look at the left hand side of the<br>graphic you'll see a violin<br>that has its strings crossed in a<br>metaphor<br>for the crucifixion of jesus christ 200<br>years later you had a composer who tried<br>to do something completely different<br>he tried to find the most dissonant<br>mischievous tuning<br>in order to conjure up the image of a<br>devil fiddler who comes to your house in<br>the middle of the night<br>playing the violin and steals your<br>children<br>i try to take this creative spark and<br>bring it to the 21st century<br>i experiment with tunings i bring it<br>into a lab<br>i record samples and i consult an expert<br>in acoustics to find out<br>why things work this way how do we get<br>new colors of sound<br>i also consult makers of instruments<br>including the world's leading innovator<br>in instrument design and you can see one<br>of his designs<br>on the right hand side of the slide<br>what do i do with this i create new<br>additions and bring it to the concert<br>hall<br>why is it significant if i could put it<br>in one word<br>it's creativity i try to provide new<br>channels of creativity for composers<br>and for performers it's about<br>understanding the instruments<br>to which they have dedicated their lives<br>and in doing so<br>realized that their new possibilities<br>literally at their fingertips<br>it's also significant because i've<br>helped answer<br>a hundred year old question that deals<br>with one of bach's most famous pieces of<br>music<br>he used an instrument which we do not<br>have in common usage today<br>but with retuning a common instrument<br>today i've managed to preserve<br>the kind of sound the kind of contrast<br>that he wanted in this very famous work<br>but it has just a personal significance<br>for me as well<br>at the end of the day when i finish this<br>and get this<br>lovely gown i'm going to ask myself<br>what's the next thing to do<br>and i know what it is it's to question<br>the things<br>thank you andrew and now we'll hear from<br>our judges and first up<br>richard yo andrew<br>hey i was told that this was like<br>i hope you're not simon cowell and you<br>no no no look i've got i've got randy<br>jackson quotes in front of me here and<br>and boy you were the right thing to<br>start this show because<br>with american idol i can say this one<br>was a hot one a bit pitchy here and<br>there<br>but i really liked it spiritual visual<br>mischievous jesus and the devil you had<br>it all man so<br>thank you so much andrew i haven't ever<br>watched american idol so i'm probably in<br>the wrong place<br>no it really was a great start for the<br>competition um i<br>thought it was great that you could be<br>spontaneous in what you were presenting<br>with adding in a few jokes very engaging<br>and really seemed to come<br>in a way that people could relate to and<br>certainly making it very personal for<br>yourself so thank you<br>great start<br>i think he was trying to do a simon i<br>really do<br>he read that whole thing from his iphone<br>so i'd be concerned about that<br>i thought you were just a wonderful<br>natural storyteller it was just<br>fantastic and you're engaged in a way<br>that was<br>very very connected with the audience<br>you know i watched you<br>you worked across the entire audience<br>you used humor you used<br>pace you were rose and fell it was just<br>wonderful so<br>congratulations and i wish i could do<br>that you know it's just<br>so clearly andrew has set a high bar for<br>the competition this afternoon<br>our second contestant is tim crawford<br>he comes to us from the department of<br>biochemistry and botany<br>he started his phd in may 2010<br>so he's been going two years and four<br>months his supervisors are dr tina<br>summerfield<br>and associate professor julian eaton rye<br>tim<br>albert einstein once said that<br>everything is energy<br>it is at the very core of our collective<br>civilization<br>and every year our thirst for it grows<br>even as our resources dwindle<br>and the prices skyrocket<br>for it is a process so efficient at<br>capturing and storing the limitless<br>energy of the sun<br>that it has changed very little in over<br>two billion years<br>so i asked what if we could tap into<br>such a process<br>what if we could somehow capture that<br>endless energy and convert it into forms<br>that we could use<br>for answers we turned to the<br>evolutionary pioneers of photosynthesis<br>the cyanobacteria when they first came<br>into existence<br>almost 3 billion years ago they<br>inhabited a world unrecognizable to us<br>and devoid of oxygen but they possessed<br>a microscopic innovation that would<br>change all that<br>photosystem 2 is a unique powerful and<br>intricate molecular engine<br>built of chlorophyll and protein in<br>place of steel and oil<br>powered by water and sunlight instead of<br>petrol and the oxygen that it releases<br>as exhaust<br>is now vital to almost all life<br>but the cyanobacteria have kept some<br>genetic relics from before their<br>machines had filled our atmosphere with<br>oxygen<br>my research is focused on a set of genes<br>that are switched on from time to time<br>to help them survive when they encounter<br>these stressful conditions once again<br>the key gene in this set is an<br>alternative form of the core component<br>in photosystem 2<br>psba1 looking backwards in time this<br>gene has implications for the evolution<br>of photosynthesis<br>but in today's aerobic environment we've<br>found that psba1 is still important<br>for the synthesis of chlorophyll and for<br>regulating the levels of photosystem 2.<br>more importantly we think that these<br>genes are crucial for the function of<br>another enzyme<br>the hydrogenase which when coupled to<br>the solar energy being channeled into<br>photosystem 2<br>could provide the solution we've been<br>looking for this tiny protein acts as a<br>safety release valve<br>taking some of the damaging excess<br>energy from photosynthesis and turning<br>it directly<br>into hydrogen gas now hydrogen is one of<br>the best fuels we have<br>it burns with a clean flame and it has<br>three times the energy per kilo<br>of gasoline if we could somehow<br>understand<br>and tap into this process then hydrogen<br>producing cyanobacteria<br>grown in bioreactors like these could<br>one day make our coal plants and oil<br>rigs<br>obsolete cyanobacteria have provided the<br>energy for life<br>on earth for almost three billion years<br>it is no stretch of the imagination<br>to envisage empowering our cities<br>vehicles<br>and industries in a sustainable and<br>completely natural fashion<br>okay tim let's hear what the judges have<br>to say for that<br>janine you have quite the support crew<br>here tim<br>thank you so much for that um you had a<br>hard job<br>with all the technical jargon and so<br>forth and i actually felt that<br>you connected it well to issues that lay<br>people could understand so well done<br>with that and made it interesting and<br>engaging<br>um you did seem to have a slightly shaky<br>start but made a really good recovery so<br>well done that's hard to do<br>thank you love the turnout fantastic 10<br>out of 10<br>for you know putting real effort um<br>good one the only thing i would say with<br>a couple of things i've got to say<br>um what you are doing i have often<br>likened the standing<br>naked in the octagon that's how tough it<br>is so well done<br>but what i would say is you know to<br>relax a little more and to enjoy<br>yourself<br>would have made the journey a wee bit<br>easier and you did you didn't do that<br>slight<br>slip but you picked it up and that was<br>well done there's great recovery<br>i would have just sort of walked out i<br>thought about it<br>i think that you know this was um in the<br>early part was aimed at an intelligent<br>person well i'm sub-intelligent and so i<br>rank myself somewhere about a<br>12-year-old and that's where you should<br>be pitching<br>and i felt that the end of your<br>presentation was what i would have<br>started with<br>because you can save the world from a<br>pretty bad<br>sort of outcome with what you're doing<br>and so you you sell that at the front<br>and then you talk about the how<br>so i would have turned it on its head<br>but i thought it was just terrific thank<br>you<br>thanks<br>hey dude you rock and uh remember i'm<br>i'm the randy jackson so you've got to<br>pitch it for the six year old as well<br>so everything is energy and you showed<br>good energy on the stage again<br>through through the good and the bad i<br>love that suit as well<br>and you know just sharp and smart and<br>confident and so<br>well done mate thanks<br>our next presenter is rebecca cook she<br>comes to us from the department of human<br>nutrition<br>she started her phd in october 2009<br>so she's been going at it for two years<br>and 11 months her supervisors are dr<br>rachel brown<br>associate professor rachel taylor and dr<br>paula andrews and i can see she's got<br>quite the support crew in the back<br>i'd like to take you on a short stroll<br>down great king street<br>16 years ago the only takeaways<br>available in the area were fish and<br>chips<br>now on a strip of less than 200 metres<br>there are two fish and chip shops<br>mcdonald's kfc pizza hut<br>domino's pizza house pizza and a<br>couplings bakery<br>not only that there are two rental<br>outlets where you can pick up a dvd or<br>game<br>to sit and watch or play while you<br>consume your calorie-laden food and<br>drinks<br>but wait there's more you can also pick<br>up some alcoholic beverages from the<br>bottle store<br>or stop in and for a few cold ones at<br>the bar<br>this is an example of the obesogenic<br>environment at work<br>the availability of high energy<br>palatable inexpensive food<br>combined with an abundance of<br>labor-saving and entertainment devices<br>designed to keep us from moving too much<br>has meant we've essentially evolved from<br>a society of hunter-gatherers<br>to a society of drive-through<br>picker-uppers<br>yet clear away the big mac wrappers and<br>discarded gym memberships<br>and you will find people that have<br>surprisingly managed to remain lean<br>somehow resistant to the obesogenic<br>environment<br>you know who i'm talking about that<br>person who seems to just eat and eat<br>whatever they want and never seems to<br>gain an<br>ounce while most of us struggle with our<br>weight and sometimes feel like we only<br>have to look at a piece of cake to gain<br>two kgs<br>what magic ingredient do the bodies of<br>these obesity and<br>resistant individuals contain is there<br>something intrinsic that they're doing<br>or not doing that somehow protects them<br>and most importantly can we use this to<br>develop strategies to help those<br>who continually struggle with their<br>weight<br>i've recruited groups of obesity<br>resistant and obesity susceptible<br>individuals<br>and compared a number of characteristics<br>that may impact on obesity risk<br>aside from genetics i've looked at the<br>usual suspects<br>dietary intake physical activity body<br>composition<br>and metabolic rate but more uniquely<br>i've also measured the body's hormonal<br>response to a meal<br>and even their sensitivity to fat and<br>food i've also developed questionnaires<br>to try and delve a little deeper into<br>what makes our bestie resistant and<br>friends different do they are they less<br>do they spend less time sitting doing<br>nothing do they only eat when they're<br>hungry are they just not that interested<br>in food and eating do they cope better<br>when you give them extra dietary<br>calories<br>did their parents refrain from using the<br>starving children in africa guilt trip<br>to get them to eat everything on their<br>plate<br>or are they just plain lucky i certainly<br>don't have all the answers<br>yet but for those of you that fall in<br>the susceptible to obesity camp<br>watch the space for those of you that<br>appear resistant to obesity<br>keep doing what you're doing but please<br>don't complain about how hard it is for<br>you to gain weight when the rest of us<br>can hear<br>thank you rebecca right we'll start with<br>michael this time<br>well done rebecca fantastic you know<br>tough<br>being out there in front not easy<br>the um what you have is something that<br>is so germane and so important to<br>every person in this room in this city<br>in this country and indeed in the world<br>and that this is we're looking at the<br>first generation<br>uh ever that will live a shorter life<br>span than their parents<br>as a result of obesity i got slightly<br>lost because i wasn't sure at times<br>where your research was heading<br>and again like your colleague earlier i<br>would have picked up the<br>headline and put it at the top because<br>what you are offering is a key<br>to a future that is about health<br>longevity<br>and a quality of life that's so<br>important so i<br>i think you are fantastic and again<br>thank you wonderful<br>um oh you've got um uh<br>he's got his uh randy he's got his ipod<br>i should say i'm going through this<br>little randomly the one i'm up to i<br>can't touch simon anymore but i<br>probably shouldn't say that one but<br>great<br>great rebecca look i i like it i like<br>you you're um<br>what you did at the start to draw us<br>into the talk you took us on a journey<br>through a visual uh that we could all<br>connect to and imagine ourselves going<br>past those<br>those take out joints um it was a very<br>good way to start pass i'm glad passed<br>yeah again<br>uh it would have been good to have some<br>take-homes to take home<br>um but that's that's a a reflection on<br>where<br>so keep up the good work really<br>thanks rebecca i want to check the rules<br>to see if i can give you extra points<br>for that fantastic banner<br>i've never seen a go nutrition banner<br>before i'm not sure that i ever will<br>again<br>um i actually really liked the structure<br>the way that you did it with the lead in<br>i did think at one point it perhaps<br>could have been slightly shorter but i<br>thought by the time you got to your<br>research<br>i was completely engaged in what you<br>were talking about and really wanted to<br>know<br>where you were going with the research<br>and exactly<br>well that was the only other comment i<br>was going to make was<br>you raised so many interesting questions<br>i'm dying to know some answers<br>even some guest answers on your part<br>would have been<br>good for that you know anticipation but<br>our next speaker is himakuma devan he<br>comes to us from the school of<br>physiotherapy<br>he's an international student from india<br>he started his phd<br>only in may this year so he's only four<br>months in so to get into this<br>competition four months in<br>is quite an achievement his supervisors<br>are dr alan carman and associate<br>good afternoon everyone let me start my<br>talk<br>by telling you a story of three<br>different people in this light<br>the one in the extreme bottom right is<br>oscar pistorius<br>he is called the fastest man with no<br>legs on the planet<br>next to him is mark ingles many of you<br>will be familiar<br>he's a kiwi of course he is the first<br>ever double amputee to climb the<br>mountainous<br>the lady next to him many of you won't<br>be familiar she is sudha chandran<br>she is one of the most acclaimed<br>bollywood dancers from india<br>so what is quite common of all the three<br>they all are quite famous<br>and they all look like quite active but<br>that's only the half of the story<br>on the other side it is only in this<br>group of people with lower limb<br>amputation<br>have the highest prevalence of low back<br>pain<br>lower back pain is a global problem in<br>new zealand<br>every second person with low limb<br>amputation suffer from low back pain<br>this percentage is approximately twice<br>that reported in the<br>general population such a high<br>prevalence made us to think<br>why is it so common and what are the<br>factors that could contribute to this<br>high prevalence<br>it has been hypothesized walking with an<br>artificial limb<br>could predispose them to asymmetrical<br>loading of low back regions<br>and that could result in low back pain<br>what is this asymmetrical loading<br>say for example a person with right<br>lower amputation<br>walking with an artificial limb could<br>walk or perform movements<br>with some degree of asymmetry like<br>leaning more towards this left leg<br>perhaps it is how they adapt to their<br>artificial limb<br>but how much of adaptation is good and<br>when it becomes a problem<br>is what we don't know and that's where<br>my thesis comes in<br>whether asymmetrical loading of low back<br>region is this a potential mechanism for<br>low back pain<br>to answer this question our initial<br>literature review revealed<br>that there is no study to investigate<br>the link between asymmetrical loading<br>and low back pain in this population<br>so we are planning to further<br>investigate this link by conducting<br>focus group interviews<br>and a national survey this will be<br>followed by a biomechanics or movement<br>analysis study<br>in a group of low level amputees with<br>and without low back pain<br>so why is it so important because our<br>study will be the first to inform<br>a new area of research investigating the<br>mechanics of asymmetrical loading<br>in this population it will inform the<br>clinicians and researchers<br>to better understand the link between<br>asymmetrical loading and low back pain<br>if we are able to find a link from my<br>thesis that will help us to device<br>prevention strategies<br>to prevent asymmetrical loading in this<br>population<br>although low back pain is not a life<br>threatening problem like a cancer<br>but just imagine the process of<br>undergoing an amputation itself<br>is a major life-changing event by<br>preventing the secondary disability<br>following amputation will definitely<br>help them to have a better quality of<br>life<br>come back after two years i'll be here<br>to show the results of this link in 2014<br>three minutes final i hope to see you<br>fantastic let's see what our judges have<br>to say about that<br>loved every minute of it dude you'd a<br>bomb<br>and certainly prize for best pressure<br>best job in the presence of competitor<br>cell phone interruption but again really<br>good<br>good style leading us in with stories<br>people we know people we don't know<br>again even with the technical language<br>coming back to what it means<br>you're a fantastic job for our youngest<br>competitor thank you very much<br>thank you you really seem to be enjoying<br>yourself and that's always very<br>infectious<br>the audience enjoyed it too really good<br>reference to your slides too i thought<br>to kind of keep people's attention with<br>that and engaging with what you've got<br>up there<br>and really nice translation of some of<br>that technical language to give people<br>something else to understand it by<br>before you started using those words<br>wow great energy unbelievable<br>you reminded me of one of those<br>i had to work really hard to keep up<br>because you you were going to get you<br>everything you couldn't with that three<br>minutes so you know sometimes<br>a little less can be more yeah so you<br>know there's a lot of information i was<br>really working<br>um the energy there was terrific um<br>and you know just congratulations and i<br>really loved the beginning because you<br>framed it in a wonderful context<br>i knew exactly where you were going and<br>you took me there<br>our fifth presenter is rebecca van amber<br>she comes to us from the department of<br>applied sciences again with a fan club<br>rebecca is an international student from<br>the united states she started her phd in<br>october 2009<br>so i was approaching three years her<br>supervisors are professor rachel lang<br>associate professor cheryl wilson and<br>rebecca<br>who here today is wearing socks<br>as i suspected it's nearly everyone in<br>the room<br>we don't know how many people worldwide<br>wear socks<br>but it's estimated that roughly 4.5<br>billion people wear shoes<br>so we can assume that a similar number<br>of people wear socks as these two<br>garments are inextricably linked<br>now the sock is a humble garment which<br>is critical to human comfort<br>and health as it provides a barrier<br>between the soft skin of the foot<br>and the relatively more rigid materials<br>of the shoe<br>this is to prevent the formation of<br>friction blisters which can be not only<br>painful<br>but they can impair locomotion and<br>provide an opening for infection<br>now many stock companies today are<br>promoting their products as having<br>unique<br>high performance properties and or<br>features and these claims can be<br>confusing or even misleading to the<br>consumer<br>so the aim of my phd is to determine<br>which common variables<br>affect the properties of socks for sport<br>and outdoor<br>activities to do this i'm investigating<br>three common fiber types<br>micron wool fine wool and acrylic<br>three yarn types single conventional<br>twist<br>and low twist and three common fabric<br>structures<br>single jersey half terry and terry and<br>you can see those different structures<br>on the upper right hand corner of my<br>slide now my research<br>is different from previous studies in<br>that i'm using<br>carefully controlled sock fabrics which<br>were made specifically for me<br>and this will allow me to directly<br>compare the variables that i'm<br>investigating<br>now i know you're all dying to know what<br>sort of sock<br>should i buy and can a superior stock<br>really be developed well so far<br>my research indicates that the most<br>important factor<br>on the thermal and moisture transfer<br>properties of sock fabrics<br>is the fabric structure yes the fiber<br>does have an effect<br>but this effect is small and it is<br>likely masked by the much larger effect<br>of fabric structure you can see this<br>clearly in the two graphs of<br>thermal resistance and water vapor<br>permeability that are behind me on my<br>slide<br>the fiber types are in blue the yarn<br>types are in red<br>and the fabric structures are in green<br>clearly the differences between the<br>different structures<br>are much larger than the differences<br>among the fabric<br>and the yarn types or sorry excuse me<br>fiber and yarn types<br>so what does this mean for you as a<br>consumer well it means that a terry sock<br>is going to be warmer and transmit less<br>water vapor<br>than a half terry or a single jersey<br>sock<br>so you might want a terry sock for cold<br>and dry conditions like skiing<br>and you might want that single jersey<br>sock for hot and humid conditions<br>maybe going on a hike so to sum it up<br>my research greatly improves our<br>understanding of sock fabrics<br>and we now have the knowledge base<br>required to develop<br>thank you rebecca let's take it to the<br>judges<br>thank you rebecca i have a son who<br>refuses to wear socks of any kind so<br>exactly i'm really interested to know<br>what's the best kind of sock so i can at<br>least try that out on them<br>um again the fan club's fantastic<br>i was interested to know where the sock<br>thing was going and now i do know<br>i thought that your presentation was<br>very clear you have a very clear voice<br>to listen to and i enjoyed listening<br>thank you i found the foot graphic<br>sufficiently disgusting<br>that i really didn't pay much attention<br>to the graphs<br>underneath you know that's probably my<br>fault and not yours but overall i<br>thought it was really a very good clear<br>presentation and you did a really nice<br>pitch<br>you certainly did did you pay all these<br>people<br>they did that on their own accord oh<br>yeah yeah yeah absolutely yeah<br>um one of the things at the beginning<br>you said that um there was something<br>like<br>i think it was four billion people wear<br>shoes is that right<br>that's what's estimated estimated and<br>most of those will wear socks well<br>i'm not sure about that because in asia<br>a lot of people don't wear socks<br>um and that i found that sort of an<br>interesting premise<br>from which to start but that said i<br>think what you presented was terrific<br>and i really really look forward to the<br>answer because i go through every<br>conceivable type of sock<br>for on the boat when i'm tramping uh in<br>the winter when i'm not in the winter<br>hand knitted not hand knitted<br>and i get the best merino and it still<br>doesn't keep me so<br>i really think that what you have has a<br>huge application to everybody in this<br>room and beyond<br>i thought in your presentation it was<br>good it was clear i understood it<br>and unlike some of the others because<br>i'm a simple person<br>not six for 12 i understood and<br>comprehended everything<br>every part of it so thank you thank you<br>so i've struggled with randy on this one<br>i'm like what<br>so i think absolutely best sock talk of<br>the day<br>in texas<br>i didn't wear my socks because i thought<br>that might be construed as a costume<br>and so i was like no really good um<br>i like i like the way you presented and<br>start i got a little bit lost again it's<br>it's one of these issues where you've<br>got a lot of variables you've got three<br>by three variables<br>but you bought it you started well i<br>thought well what are we talking about<br>here lots of variables you did bring it<br>back<br>very well at the end in terms of clearly<br>describing<br>what the main findings were so again<br>it's one of these things when you<br>when you give a presentation you can<br>lose people in the middle sometimes but<br>as long as you<br>bring them back at the end that can be<br>very good so<br>our sixth presenter uh is<br>neil valeri he's from the department of<br>english and<br>linguistics he's an international<br>student from northern ireland<br>and he's on a prestigious new zealand<br>also a good group of supporters there he<br>started his<br>phd uh relatively recently as well in<br>march 2012.<br>his supervisors are professor evelyn<br>neil<br>we flick a switch and our surroundings<br>are bearded than light<br>we go out at night and our streets are<br>lined with light<br>we go to the theater and our attention<br>is directed by light<br>for us light is everywhere it is such a<br>fundamental narrator in the story of our<br>daily existence<br>yet we are rarely conscious of its<br>defining beings<br>we depend so much on its ubiquity that<br>we dare not contemplate an existence<br>without it<br>yet it hasn't always been this way in<br>fact far from it<br>in the pre-industrial worlds of 16th and<br>17th century europe<br>life often had to be contemplated<br>without light<br>imagine a time before electric where<br>light was just a flame<br>imagine going to a theater where there's<br>little contrast between the lighting of<br>the stage<br>and the auditorium these are just some<br>of the conditions<br>in which the early modern individual<br>experience light<br>elizabethan playwright john marston<br>values candlelight so highly<br>that he personifies it as a poet but not<br>just any poet<br>a rare and skillful poet when we<br>consider the night time that marsden<br>would have experienced<br>we can see why light would have been<br>worthy of such high praise<br>for marston and his contemporaries light<br>was a precious material<br>that offered an escape from the acute<br>anxiety of night<br>my thesis argues that the ways in which<br>we experience light<br>are the ways in which we represent light<br>and language characterize the ways in<br>which we experience light in the world<br>since experiences of light differed so<br>vastly in the 16th and 17th century<br>then i call for re-examination of the<br>meanings of light<br>on the early modern stage we must ask<br>what was light what materials were used<br>in artificial lighting<br>who had access to these materials how<br>when and where were they used in what<br>ways did lighting differ between<br>outdoor and indoor theaters what was<br>daytime like<br>what was nighttime like it's through<br>answering these questions<br>that we come to understand the<br>conditions which the early modern<br>individual conceptualized light so<br>when byron states and shakespeare's<br>love's labour's lost<br>light seeking light the the light of<br>life beguile<br>i argue that we cannot simply interpret<br>these representations of light<br>in relation to the world that we<br>experience rather<br>their meanings are deeply embedded in<br>the conditions of the early modern world<br>it's through investigating how the early<br>modern individual experience these<br>conditions<br>that we come to understand shakespeare's<br>light and the rare furking satirist that<br>is martin's poet<br>show them the light neil yeah right<br>judges<br>excellent you are a storyteller<br>and you posed questions they're great<br>questions<br>and i felt engaged i felt entertained i<br>wasn't quite sure where you were taking<br>me but i was willing to go for the ride<br>and at the end of the dark tunnel there<br>was light<br>i really want the interpretation of<br>firking i'm not quite sure what that is<br>yeah<br>i had to be careful with that that's<br>right<br>well i was transfected transfixed might<br>but they're really wonderful questions<br>because<br>in in looking back we assume it is like<br>it<br>it was like it is and it isn't so i i<br>think that's a wonderful journey and so<br>thank you for that and um<br>yeah a little bit of dylan thomason<br>there i thought and just yeah<br>so for a scholar of your discipline the<br>language was immaculate and<br>it resonated with me because of my<br>background in optics and light<br>and the fact that you wanted to connect<br>the language to the<br>to the physical world that was was lived<br>i thought it was great<br>you used some very good techniques of<br>repetition<br>the word light then in the middle<br>imagine and imagine and imagine this and<br>then repeated questions at the end<br>indeed thank you very much neil i found<br>that enormously relaxing to listen to<br>in fact i was sitting here listening and<br>listening and i thought i'd written<br>anything down<br>suddenly so then i furiously wrote lots<br>of things down<br>um there was a little blip when you came<br>to talk about<br>what your phd is and i felt like saying<br>no stop say that again so i can<br>take it in and listen because it was<br>really important and i really wanted to<br>make that connection but<br>i thought it was an outstanding<br>presentation beautifully delivered thank<br>right we've got two speakers to go our<br>next speaker is alemanda<br>fatiosi she comes to us from the<br>department of medicine and the<br>university of otago christchurch<br>she started her phd in january 2008<br>and her thesis is currently being<br>examined<br>her supervisors are professor vicki<br>cameron and associate professor richard<br>troutham<br>alameda<br>um kiara now heart disease<br>is one of the biggest killers and is the<br>cause of about 40<br>of all deaths in new zealand but when we<br>look<br>at how heart disease affects different<br>ethnic groups<br>across new zealand what we see is that<br>maori have the highest rates of death<br>from heart disease<br>compared to non-maori and that when they<br>die of heart disease<br>they die on average 10 years younger<br>than non-maori<br>which leads me to the question why are<br>maori dying earlier of heart disease<br>well in new zealand we have the national<br>cardiovascular guidelines and<br>these guidelines inform doctors when<br>they should start screening for heart<br>disease risk factors<br>but also how to treat these risk factors<br>in order to improve heart health<br>so my project was to compare the levels<br>of heart disease risk factors between<br>two very different maori communities the<br>first<br>were a rural maori community up in<br>wairoa in the north island<br>and the second were an urban mighty<br>community in christchurch city<br>these were then compared to a non-maori<br>group<br>and the non-mighty group were living in<br>christchurch city<br>and they were age and gender matched to<br>our urban maori group<br>so we recruited approximately 250<br>participants<br>within each community group and they<br>were all randomly selected from the<br>electoral role<br>and aged between 20 to 64 years of age<br>now the findings of my thesis showed<br>that<br>even though 80 of all people within each<br>of these three communities<br>had regularly visited their doctors<br>there were very different rates of heart<br>disease risk factors between the<br>communities<br>and the key risk factors are shown in<br>that figure down the on the right hand<br>side<br>and in all cases as you can see these<br>risk factors were much<br>higher in maori than non-maori so<br>why are maori dying earlier of heart<br>disease<br>well again from our research it is clear<br>that maori are going to their doctors<br>just as much as don maori<br>but they are not being adequately<br>screened for heart disease risk factors<br>and that their risk factors are not<br>being managed well<br>so in order um<br>so i ask again you know why are marty<br>doing earlier well<br>you know we need to have uh adequate<br>screening for maori participants<br>and so what can the health system do in<br>order to improve heart health in maori<br>communities<br>well there's no need for new<br>interventions but simply that doctors<br>screen more for heart disease risk<br>factors and they effectively treat these<br>heart disease risk factors<br>in order to improve heart health amongst<br>all maori communities across new zealand<br>thank you amanda and for anyone to um<br>actually complete a phd<br>during what's happened in christchurch<br>recently that's a terrific achievement<br>so let's take it to our judges yeah hey<br>look that was great it's nice simple<br>compelling<br>question with good information along and<br>you've um<br>you've done what is a really good thing<br>for uh for a talk you've got me wanting<br>to come up and talk to you afterwards<br>and ask you a thousand questions and<br>about what we can do and<br>and what leads on from that so you've<br>provided a good a good beginning a<br>middle and an end a little bit shaky<br>towards the end but you've got me<br>wanting to know more so that was<br>thank you yes very clear beautifully<br>paced<br>that little shaky bit maybe at the end<br>but um<br>i thought the difference perhaps in<br>style was<br>that you kind of well i felt drawn in to<br>what you were talking about rather than<br>it being pitched at me<br>so it was quite a different style and i<br>found it really engaging so well done<br>i absolutely agree you you have a<br>wonderfully easy style<br>you're a natural communicator you took<br>your time<br>and you walked us through something that<br>was complex but i never got lost<br>you engaged so well with people and<br>as richard said or should we say yo<br>richard<br>i understood everything and and you<br>kept control and so it was just<br>wonderful so thank you for that<br>now we come to our last present for the<br>afternoon and it's fabuka finkler<br>she comes to us from the department of<br>tourism<br>she started her phd in october last year<br>so she's been studying at it for about<br>11 months<br>her otago supervisor is professor james<br>heim<br>and she has a spanish supervisor as well<br>who i'll try to pronounce it's professor<br>bienvenido leon<br>vetka<br>i remember going on my first<br>well-watching trip 16 years ago<br>dressed up in a red survival suit<br>traveling off the coast of vancouver<br>island in a small zodiac<br>no other boats around just us the sight<br>in the sound of the 14 meter gray whale<br>surfacing beside a small boat shortly<br>after<br>has stayed with me since overwhelming<br>experiencing such charismatic giants<br>four years later i'm standing on a cliff<br>top on nearby san juan islands<br>conducting field work for my master's<br>degree on whale watching<br>in the distance i noticed the flotilla<br>of boats approaching<br>shortly after i'm counting 25 kilowatts<br>and 120 boats what was going on<br>we had only just brought whales back<br>from the brink of extinction<br>and now it looked like we were loving<br>them to death instead<br>in 2008 13 million people went while<br>watching<br>in 119 countries generating<br>2.1 billion u.s dollars<br>since the save the whale movement of the<br>70s while watching around the globe has<br>developed into a mass ecotourism<br>industry<br>widely regarded as the antithesis to<br>whaling<br>and equal to conservation my phd will<br>challenge that perception<br>marketing by operators in<br>non-governmental organizations<br>has played a key role in the growth of<br>whale watching and how it is perceived<br>by the public<br>promoting close encounters and attaching<br>those to conservation<br>while this marketing wants us to believe<br>that whale watching is a benign activity<br>in reality that is not true a<br>significant body of research indicates<br>that whale watching can endanger<br>populations of whales and dolphins<br>mainly due to proximity of boats and<br>associated underwater noise pollution<br>yet management and communication of<br>science have largely failed<br>and there's widespread public naivety<br>about the impacts of whale watching<br>the solution requires that the public's<br>attitude<br>including whale watchers has to be<br>changed and that they become aware of<br>the need to keep that distance from the<br>whales<br>we need to manage expectations<br>my phd research is investigating a new<br>communication framework<br>based on the concept of a psy commercial<br>it's a commercial conveying science<br>drawing on elements of documentaries<br>and tv advertising i will produce<br>and test sci commercials and for the<br>consumer to buy into the concept<br>that sustainable while watching has to<br>be experienced from a safe distance to<br>the whales<br>only an informed public can make<br>informed choices<br>and this psi commercial framework is a<br>new science advocacy management tool<br>for the whale watching industry that can<br>be used<br>to bridge a gap between scientists<br>operators<br>and the public we have saved the whales<br>once before<br>and potentially my research can help to<br>good use of the full three minutes there<br>i was gonna say i'll discount the words<br>once again since they came after the<br>bell<br>but fantastic support crew again in fact<br>it has just been such great audience<br>participation and engagement and it's<br>really fantastic to see<br>i thought you gave a really compelling<br>and clear communication of the problem<br>that you're addressing which is<br>obviously a very important one<br>and one that i've often wondered about<br>myself so i'm really personally<br>interested in what it is you're going to<br>find<br>i suspect the challenge for you when it<br>comes to trying to apply your research<br>will be<br>how not to come across as the party<br>pooper but i hope that you do find a way<br>to do that really nice presentation<br>certainly a very very important subject<br>tourism is held up as the great answer<br>to a great many things and it isn't<br>it has a very dark side to it i thought<br>you started with a wonderful story<br>you engaged the audience you painted a<br>terrific picture<br>and you i fell in love with the whales<br>and then you put them back under threat<br>and i thought it was a very very good<br>device<br>you gave people a great context and<br>which to understand your research<br>and your arc from beginning to end was a<br>wonderful arc so it's a very very well<br>told three minute story<br>and you know 10 out of 10 for hitting<br>the bell with only two words over<br>and i absolutely understood everything<br>about it so well done<br>man the kids this time i think they want<br>it worse than ever<br>no really really great webca i uh again<br>the storytelling<br>and uh the one of the things about this<br>competition is that<br>you get the opportunity to use a visual<br>cues but you can only use one slide i<br>think everyone's done that very very<br>well of use of visuals and not<br>using it as a crutch because you used<br>some<br>modulation and pitch you use your voice<br>to signpost the talk just as<br>i was getting to the end of your story<br>and thinking well when are you going to<br>tell me what the solution is you say the<br>solution will be and then when i'm<br>thinking and<br>what are you going to produce you told<br>me what you would produce from your work<br>and you signposted that talk<br>very very well bringing me through from<br>the beginning again through a middle to<br>well i think you'll agree that's been a<br>fantastic set of presentations<br>um and we can see why they're all<br>finalists so well done<br>everyone now we're going to have a break<br>so that the judges can deliberate so<br>probably be up to about 10 minutes so i<br>suggest you stretch your legs and have a<br>chat to your neighbors and as soon as<br>the judges are back we'll get into the<br>okay we are now going to hear the uh<br>verdicts from the judges<br>and i will ask professor richard blakey<br>our chief judge to come up and say a few<br>words<br>and then he's going to get our officemax<br>staff here to come up and present the<br>prizes<br>thank you all susan can you start the<br>clock i should be timed for three<br>minutes for this<br>i need to say some general comments on<br>the afternoon impressions<br>of the judges i thought the judges did a<br>very good job i think that judge<br>it was an outstanding performance from<br>all three judges and i think you should<br>likewise to rachel chris andy and the<br>team who have put this together and<br>claire of course a big round of applause<br>let me tell you this is hard to do<br>a phd is a significant body of work<br>you have to make an a significant<br>contribution to knowledge<br>and you have enough material even after<br>four months in a phd to<br>talk for many many hours so distilling<br>that down into simple message that is<br>deliverable to this kind of audience<br>in three minutes is a very significant<br>task and<br>all of our competitors today did very<br>very well they've gone through some<br>preliminary rounds they're well<br>practiced and well-versed and<br>the the skills that you've learned in<br>doing this will serve you well<br>in whatever careers you have so i'm<br>really pleased to have been involved as<br>a judge this year and i have to say<br>it was a hard job deciding who<br>to award the prize to<br>and that must just about be three<br>minutes is it<br>well thank you to the sponsors as well<br>without our sponsors and<br>of course to our school student judges<br>um uh this would have been a lesser<br>event and<br>officemax who's here from officemax that<br>we can all give a round of applause to<br>without you it would have been a lesser<br>event particularly from the competitor's<br>i will now invite um the school student<br>representative<br>to present the school's prize which is a<br>250 um<br>award and it is emily gordon from<br>queen's high school i believe he's going<br>to come down and present<br>okay so the winner of the student prize<br>right and now i'll ask david bennett the<br>key account manager from office max to<br>come up and prince present the judge's<br>prize<br>third place which is a 500 study grant<br>from officemax<br>second place which is a 750 dollar study<br>grant from office max<br>goes to alemanda fa alla osei<br>and the supreme award winner which is a<br>fifteen hundred dollar study grant from<br>office max<br>plus the expenses paid trip<br>to attend the third australasian 3mt<br>company competition at the university of<br>queensland<br>that one sponsored by graduate research<br>services is<br>um so thank you all for attending i<br>think um<br>we've done that we've had a very nice<br>afternoon's entertainment and i think it<br>served a purpose very well<br>um i'd like you to thank uh the<br>organizers and the contestants again<br>and um<br>i just like all the other contestants to<br>come up we have a<br>certificate and a small gift of<br>appreciation for all of the other<br>contestants who performed extremely well<br>so<br>thank you all if you just want to come<br>hey<br>finally we do have a small gift for our<br>judges<br>so they've done a tremendous job i think<br>they've provided us with entertainment<br>and some very constructive feedback for<br>the contestants as well<br>it was a really tough job to judge that<br>lot i think they were all terrific<br>i'd also like to invite our audience<br>back to<br>um some drinks and nibbles at the<br>post-graduate lounge the gazebo lounge<br>in the um in the center<br>oh sorry in the union in the<br>isb so please come up to that all the<br>audience unfortunately we can't extend<br>that welcome to our school pupils but<br>but those of age are welcome to join us<br>for not only for some<br>refreshments there but to further<br>discussions with our presenters because<br>i'm sure that sparked our interest in<br>their research and it'll be terrific to<br>be able to talk to our presenters<br>and learn a little bit more about their<br>research so i hope you'll join us there<br>that'll be at four o'clock<br>finally we hope to
