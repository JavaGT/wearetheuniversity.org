font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>making friends when you're in Auckland<br>is actually quite easy especially if<br>you're living in one of the halls when I<br>came here I literally knew a friend of a<br>friend of a friend I found that people<br>were really genuinely interested and<br>very kind and easy to get along with so<br>making friends was an alien issue the<br>best thing about living in the hall for<br>me is being surrounded by people all the<br>time I'm a very social person so having<br>two hundred other friends right outside<br>your door I really like that whole life<br>offered me personally a good opportunity<br>to put myself out there because you're<br>living with so many people you're going<br>to bond with so many and for me last<br>another great thing about the hall life<br>though is all the activities that we put<br>on throughout the year<br>so there's like secret admirers week<br>there's a formal dinner there's dances<br>all different kinds of stuff<br>we have inter hall sports cricket rugby<br>hockey handball your door is always open<br>if you want to talk to people but you<br>can shut it if you need to study or you<br>need some alone time or you just need<br>some time to think you know you can<br>spend the whole day socializing and<br>stuff but then at the end of the day<br>when you realize actually I need to<br>knuckle down and get some serious study<br>done or something that you can always<br>just lock your door and you can be alone<br>when you want everything's provided for<br>you and it makes life so much easier<br>especially if you're moving away from<br>we are so close to the university that<br>you can just walk down there even if<br>it's late at night and you need to get a<br>book from the general library it's<br>the food here is really good and I was<br>quite surprised and impressed we've got<br>very talented chefs here they give us a<br>lot and there's always something there<br>you need a if you think you're better<br>off cooking by yourself we have the<br>kitchens we've got the fridges you know<br>people can get their own food and people<br>sort of get into groups even you know<br>outside of the meal plan and do their<br>residential assistants are here to help<br>you with a number of different things<br>that may come up our job is to look<br>after the residents whether it be<br>personal problems problems down at uni<br>or just any other matter moving out of<br>home is a fairly big step in a young<br>person's life so having someone who they<br>can talk to and just someone there to<br>support them is quite a nice thing to<br>have<br>they're also around to keep an eye on on<br>how things are going here at the hall<br>and that you're able to sleep they try<br>and make sure that people aren't being<br>structure to everyone else particularly<br>during exams times they really knuckle<br>down and make sure that everyone's got<br>an equal opportunity to study when and<br>how they want to help sort of enforce<br>the rules but at the same time they're<br>also there to make sure everyone's<br>having fun and there's no problems going<br>on so we go around and do lockup every<br>night just to make sure that the<br>security of the hall is maintained and<br>that people don't really have to worry<br>I love Auckland yeah I'm from quite a<br>small town so just being in the city<br>that has so much going for it<br>as Auckland does it's great love living<br>here because it is really the gateway to<br>New Zealand there's all these people<br>from other countries as well that you<br>can meet and make friends with them<br>learn lots about other cultures and<br>stuff everything's so close everything<br>is just so convenient and pretty much<br>every doorstep it's just a fun place to<br>be<br>one advantage to living in the halls<br>that a lot of students fund is that it<br>is a great place to find flatmates it's<br>also just a very supportive environment<br>I think you're getting emotional support<br>from all your friends so if you're<br>feeling bad people will notice and<br>they'll kind of like keep an eye on you<br>and make sure that your needs are being<br>met it really offers you a chance to<br>have the best balance of social life as<br>well as an academic life in the student<br>life it's an online application system<br>we have to do is jump online until<br>University website had accommodation and<br>you're away all the so fun I just knew</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
