Once food is secure, in the short or longer term, there is time for other things - investigation into how things work (the sciences) and the recording of events (the arts). The sciences and arts are the foundation of civilisation - as long as there is food. <br><br>Scientific developments during past century allowed unprecedented gains in food production, and society grew used to ever-cheaper, high-quality food. This century, population and poor harvests have put huge pressure on resources and we are now reaping the effects of 30 years of complacency. <br><br>What is New Zealand's role in food production in the future? In her Inaugural Professorial Lecture, Professor of Agribusiness Jacqueline Rowarth will discuss how we can encourage science - without neglecting the arts - for the benefit of our graduates, economy and future generations. <br><br>Professor Rowarth's Inaugural Professorial Lecture takes place at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, from 6-7pm on September 18, 2012. This lecture is FREE and open to the public.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I'm Declan Roe the professor of angry<br>business at the University of waikato<br>and an inaugural address and I've been<br>invited to give mine on the 18th of<br>September is a chance to talk about the<br>research that one has done and concerns<br>that one might have and though my most<br>of my research is to do with fertilizer<br>and soils and plant and therefore<br>productivity for New Zealand my major<br>concerns are the place that agriculture<br>has in New Zealand and the continuing<br>and perhaps misunderstanding about what<br>it takes to produce so it is my belief<br>that indeed my research that shows that<br>food security is what underpins<br>civilization<br>so once food is secure people have<br>enough to eat they have time to<br>investigate the world around them that<br>is the sciences and they have time to<br>develop the Arts that add to the<br>richness of life it's the culture that<br>is derived around the security of food<br>that makes life what it is makes it<br>civilization what I observe is that over<br>60 percent of the wars that have<br>occurred in the last 15 years have been<br>about resources it's water it's land<br>it's food when we start losing food<br>security or being quite sure that we<br>will be able to afford meal for food for<br>our tables there is unrest and in 2008<br>2011 concerns about the cost of food it<br>was the violent price swings that were<br>going on actually caused food riots in<br>different countries around the world two<br>dozen countries actually suffered and<br>what really is of concern is that we<br>haven't got the population now that<br>under stand how to produce food<br>sustainably part of my role at the<br>University of waikato is actually to<br>encourage next Generations to come and<br>learn about agribusiness agri-food<br>production angry well adding value to<br>our primary produce so that they can<br>contribute to what the world needs the<br>world is suffering a dire shortage of<br>Simply the talent that goes into<br>producing food and I think the more we<br>understand about what it takes to<br>produce food sustainably and that is<br>protecting resources making sure that it<br>is Affordable but also being<br>economically viable as well as socially<br>acceptable the more we will have a<br>vibrant agricultural community and that<br>vibrant agricultural Community is vital<br>for the waikato for New Zealand and for<br>the world I look forward to seeing you<br>there</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
