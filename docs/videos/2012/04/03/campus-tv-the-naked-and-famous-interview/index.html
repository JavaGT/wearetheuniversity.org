album how do you plan to<br>follow that up i mean what are you guys<br>doing this year what's 2012 hold for you<br>guys<br>um i mean we're just gonna keep doing<br>the same thing to be honest with you<br>like the things like music awards and<br>stuff like that is it's like<br>amazingly flattering and it's yeah it's<br>hard to kind of comment on<br>about you know like people always get<br>pissed off when they don't see you being<br>gracious and stuff but i mean like<br>it's not that like we're not in it for<br>awards or anything like that a success<br>it's like i've just always wanted to be<br>in a band everyone's always wanting to<br>be making music it's a<br>it's like a passion and a lifestyle so<br>it's not really about sort of<br>you know popularity and recognition that<br>kind of thing we're just going to keep<br>being<br>honest about what we're doing and trying<br>to do it for the right reasons and for<br>us it's just<br>creativity urge you know if if we<br>weren't feeling like writing music and<br>creating an album and like kind of<br>exploring<br>music as an art form and as like a<br>lifestyle then it was you know we should<br>we should give it up so<br>yeah but we still feel pretty inspired<br>we've been doing a bit of writing and<br>stuff and yeah<br>yeah we're in good spirits all right so<br>this year you know can we expect any new<br>material<br>to surface i mean i'd love to say yes<br>but like<br>most likely maybe yeah<br>not too busy it's um last year was<br>dedicated to<br>touring and promoting passively<br>aggressive you yeah and um<br>we've had a bit of time to write and<br>there's there's a lot of things that<br>we're working on now<br>so um about midway through this year<br>or i don't know april that's when we're<br>gonna start working like working on<br>finalizing new material and stuff yeah<br>and it will materialize<br>next year yeah yeah it's a big<br>university over there there must be<br>quite like a bit of pressure coming off<br>this album<br>and sort of like you know oh [ __ ] now<br>i'm gonna make a really good one you<br>know yeah well this<br>there's this sort of like saying um like<br>the<br>second album syndrome or whatever it's<br>called or like it's<br>this concept within the industry i guess<br>we sort of learned from<br>um i don't know just being involved in<br>the music industry<br>around the world where bands can often<br>have that like a lot of pressure and a<br>lot of lead up to album number two yeah<br>um and i think the sad thing is that i<br>think<br>that awareness that people have of the<br>difficulty to create album to the pitch<br>like that<br>perpetuates the whole yeah stress itself<br>so i think<br>because people are like oh the second<br>album is going to be going to be great<br>yeah even if it was really great people<br>will still<br>always be judging it on the basis of<br>that supposed to be better so<br>it's almost like you're stuck in this<br>cycle of like trying to<br>catch up to your own expectations or<br>other people's expectations so i mean<br>the pressure for us is more um<br>i think it's much more like industry<br>orientated like you know like we feel<br>pressure from our label<br>um to you know get it finished and get<br>it done on time and and they'll they'll<br>have certain expectations<br>and i think with with people are<br>involved in the industry like that<br>often their expectations can be<br>sort of like they don't actually almost<br>like understand what their expectations<br>are<br>like they'll hear a song and maybe they<br>don't get it right away but<br>someone like a music fan will really<br>really love it and they'll i think it's<br>amazing<br>but because the person at the label<br>doesn't quite get it right away they<br>think it's not good enough or something<br>or you know like<br>people's people's expectations are kind<br>of just they go up and down and they<br>vary and stuff so<br>i don't know i think we're just going to<br>try and ignore everyone<br>do what we want most material on on the<br>album that you released last year is you<br>know<br>it might sound like i have to say this<br>but it's really good stuff thank you<br>quite honestly<br>thank you um when you were writing and<br>recording the album did you have a lot<br>of stuff already that you sort of just<br>brought on that you'd already written<br>i mean oh yeah it was like it was like<br>the slow sort of accumulative process<br>for us because we were like working<br>day jobs and just you know like normal<br>lives just<br>scrounging to get money together to pay<br>for rent that was like horrendous living<br>in the city<br>um so yeah it was it was quite slow and<br>it sort of went from<br>when we found david and jesse who were<br>like old friends from college just<br>friends and friends and stuff we were<br>like<br>that was like david doing come play bass<br>and he was like oh we've got university<br>incredible i was like nah it'd be cool<br>come on yeah<br>and that's pretty much it yeah and<br>you're like okay<br>and then jesse the drummer was uh<br>working some job that he<br>so it was like you know kind of hated it<br>and stuff so we just had to like sort<br>out our lives at the same time as try<br>and do this bad thing so<br>from about the start of 2009 to<br>when we released young blood which was<br>yeah 2000 to end<br>start 2010 yeah it was kind of like all<br>that time we were writing and rehearsing<br>and learning how to be like a band<br>together because you know we never<br>played together and stuff so it took a<br>long time to<br>work out the communication and all that<br>it's been quite like quite a daunting<br>thing to sort of<br>leave job security behind and dedicate<br>yourself to a band oh totally like oh<br>what if we don't make it you know what i<br>mean no it's horrifying yeah it's the<br>most nerve-wracking thing but<br>very luckily for us by the time we up<br>and left the country to go overseas and<br>start touring<br>all these uh like security things had<br>been sort of in place like we had a<br>booking agent<br>we had a big record deal with like you<br>know tour support and loads of money to<br>throw around and stuff like that<br>and and it gets very like this you start<br>sort of like holy crap i can i can do<br>this we can do this full time<br>but even when you've got things like<br>tour support which is like guaranteed<br>money<br>that you're going to be given you're<br>kind of still like how does it work<br>where's it going to go who's going to<br>spend it<br>who's got the card where's the account<br>going oh my god you just don't know<br>what's going on<br>but then as it starts rolling and the<br>process starts happening you start to<br>kind of understand how things<br>kind of work and it's like any business<br>a lot of money comes in and then just as<br>much goes right back out<br>you know and it's kind of like this<br>constant you know the business side of<br>it<br>it takes a long but it's it is always<br>scary because you always wonder it's<br>like<br>[ __ ] i could just run out any minute and<br>i bought a lot of trousers this year<br>that<br>none of them fit so i had to go like<br>sell these trousers at this<br>second-hand store it sounds the complete<br>opposite of what people would expect<br>you to hear from like yeah a rock fan i<br>didn't buy any drugs i just bought uh<br>yeah<br>guitar pedals and trousers trousers<br>prostitutes or is that not<br>no no i'm a little bit as your rider<br>here<br>like no a lot of demands no see we have<br>like discussions about excessive<br>spending on the writer<br>it's like whether or not we deserve<br>chocolates yeah he's like<br>like chocolate on weekends only oh<br>really we're very particular about<br>there's a weekend rider and there's like<br>just in america every time you put down<br>corn<br>chips they give you this bucket like a<br>trough yeah of corn chips and it's like<br>it's not like a bag of cc's it's like<br>this giant<br>thing of corn chips is absolutely okay<br>so we've had this ongoing discussion<br>about<br>the [ __ ] need for corn chips on the<br>rider i reckon we've we've bought like a<br>packet of corn chips a day in america<br>and it's just been a waste in my opinion<br>yeah<br>fair enough okay well last question is<br>the obvious one<br>because i'm quite interested in this and<br>i'm sure um<br>what is what would you say your sound is<br>because it's actually it's quite<br>different<br>thank you thank you um i think we i<br>think we just like to<br>kind of try and be as unpretentious<br>about it as possible and i just like to<br>say we're either a rock band because a<br>rock band can<br>you know that community from from like i<br>don't know<br>music from the 70s to current electronic<br>bands now you know like that's all just<br>rock music and<br>is it essentially a rock band you know<br>um or an alternative pop band<br>yeah or a popular alternative band yeah<br>all these labels<br>oh yeah but i mean those are bigger than<br>saying we're like electro<br>rock yeah i think i think alternative<br>rock is a pretty pretty safe thing like<br>it encompasses all our influences and it<br>encompasses all the different sounds<br>on the record and stuff so i think<br>alternative rock is a pretty safe<br>safe place for us thanks dave that was<br>way more chilled out<br>cheers guys cheers keep chugging all<br>right</p></main><footer
