when considering a life on the road.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so I'm going to attempt to work the<br>clicker and my notes at the same time I<br>can't promise you it will go well but I<br>will do my best so a little bit about me<br>so I was born and raised in Auckland<br>I lived overseas the first time when I<br>was 4 my father was from Croatia so we<br>went back for 3 months when I was 4 I<br>don't remember much of that we went back<br>again when I was 8 and I had to go to<br>school so I remember that a lot more the<br>thing I remember most is that in the<br>summer school finished at noon so I got<br>to spend all of the afternoon on the<br>beach which I thought was a much better<br>system I then went on my first hour and<br>lived in Scotland for two years in 1998<br>and then in 2005 my bin boyfriend now<br>husband and I left New Zealand to go of<br>adventuring and we went to the<br>Netherlands because my husband has Dutch<br>parents so he had a Dutch passport and<br>we thought that would be a great place<br>to go we then moved to the UK and in the<br>US that should say and came back in 2017<br>so I have a lot of experience personally<br>of moving around and living and working<br>in different places and then in my<br>professional life I'm a talent<br>development manager and leadership<br>development specialist<br>so we used a lot of mobility as a<br>development tool so we moved a lot of<br>people to different locations to gain<br>work experience particularly with<br>leadership development if we're<br>developing leaders of global<br>organisations we want them to have<br>experience in different markets so I've<br>also kind of moved people around for<br>professional reasons since I've come<br>back I've started a blog called how to<br>have a happy homecoming which is<br>actually about repatriation and the<br>experience of coming back to live in New<br>Zealand and I interviewed a bunch of<br>people from all over the world who have<br>come back to live in New Zealand<br>both and I'm married with one care so<br>what I'm going to do tonight is talk you<br>through at quite a high level the<br>experience of being aglow med and to<br>start off as all good talks do with a<br>definition what is a glow med well it's<br>a made-up word<br>that I made up to try and kind of<br>describe what I mean so the first part<br>is global so this is to do with being a<br>citizen of the world or having a kind of<br>global outlook so it's about how do you<br>kind of see yourself you know are you<br>just you know from Auckland is that your<br>main identity are you a New Zealand ER<br>or do you see yourself as somebody is<br>kind of a citizen of the world and you<br>have an international orientation one of<br>the defining characteristics though if<br>you're going to be a Glo med is that you<br>have to also be really good at becoming<br>a local very quickly you have to be able<br>to grow where you are planted you can't<br>just go and live in other places and<br>kind of be a hostage until you get to<br>leave and then there's the nomadic part<br>Glo meds move around and so in that<br>sense they're quite different to<br>immigrants who move to one place and<br>stay there forever so how do you become<br>a Glo met the common path one that's<br>becoming even more common as the<br>self-initiated a lot of New Zealanders<br>kind of go off and do this they get<br>there are we they're working holiday<br>visa they go there to two years<br>somewhere they're not quite ready to<br>come back so they move somewhere else<br>and they move somewhere else and they<br>move somewhere else that can be quite<br>accidental usually because they're a bit<br>bored and they want to have a sense of<br>adventure or they're not quite ready to<br>settle down and get a proper job all<br>these kinds of things company transfers<br>are also very common as I said if you<br>have aspirations towards leadership<br>particularly if you're working for a<br>multinational firm you will probably get<br>the opportunity to make a move overseas<br>if that's kind of what you're interested<br>in then you know you need to be aware<br>that this is increasingly becoming a<br>requirement for multinational firms and<br>often if your partner is moved for their<br>career you will go with them to support<br>them and you are kind of considered the<br>appendage but you go through exactly the<br>same experience that they go through but<br>your happiness and lots of ways is<br>actually more important so the number<br>one cause of assignment failure someone<br>who's been sent to another country by<br>their company is that the spouse is<br>unhappy so when the employee has to<br>choose between their partner or their<br>job they'll usually choose their partner<br>not always usually so so they're a very<br>very important part of this process if<br>you are travelling as a couple or as a<br>family so what I'm going to do tonight<br>is I'm going to talk you through what I<br>call the Glo medic lifestyle cycle which<br>some of you will recognize as Mo's lows<br>hierarchy of needs and the reason I use<br>this is that a few years ago when I had<br>just moved to the US a friend that I'd<br>made in the Netherlands got in touch<br>with me and she had moved for the first<br>time ever to another country she was<br>about 41 at the time and her partner had<br>got a job in Indonesia and Jakarta so<br>she had gone thinking it would be a<br>great lark and three months and she sent<br>me this email saying you have to help me<br>I don't know what I'm doing I can't cope<br>how do you do it<br>and she's got a similar background to me<br>issues and leadership development and<br>kind of organizational development and I<br>thought how can I explain it to her in a<br>way that will make sense and also kind<br>of give her a some structure with which<br>to understand this experience so this<br>was<br>of doing the rounds on Facebook and I<br>thought actually that's perfect that's<br>exactly what it's like every time you<br>move to a new place you start at the<br>bottom of the pyramid again and you have<br>to work yourself back up it so this<br>process that I'm going to walk you<br>through tonight that's something that<br>you will go through regardless of how<br>you got there so it doesn't matter if<br>you took yourself it doesn't matter if<br>the company transferred you it doesn't<br>matter if you're the trailing spouse the<br>process of getting settled in a new<br>place of establishing yourself in a new<br>place that's going to more or less<br>follow this I'm going to talk about how<br>you can increase your globality quotient<br>another made-up term don't look for an<br>EOB textbook it won't be there but it is<br>a set of skills and an ability a set of<br>abilities that you can learn and you can<br>develop so the more practice you get the<br>better you become at it members of the<br>same family may experience the process<br>and different ways and of course you do<br>need Wi-Fi to do anything these days so<br>I'm just going to give you some examples<br>from my own experience obviously this is<br>a massive topic what we will have at the<br>end is about 20 minutes of Q&amp;A so if<br>you've got something specific that you<br>want me to go back to write it down and<br>ask me at the end so the first thing<br>that you're probably thinking is well if<br>I'm going to go and live in another<br>country I'm going to need a job and jobs<br>are interesting because they're related<br>to the safety element they're related to<br>security and for a lot of people they're<br>also related to self-esteem practically<br>in order to work somewhere in another<br>country you need the legal right to work<br>there so that means that you need to<br>have some sort of work visa now whether<br>or not you if you take yourself you will<br>be responsible for making sure that<br>you're legally entitled to work<br>somewhere so you need to do your<br>research and find out what kind of visa<br>you need and I'm going to talk a little<br>bit more about this when I give you some<br>kind of advice on practicalities if you<br>have a residence visa you may be<br>entitled to live somewhere but you may<br>not be entitled to work there and that's<br>particularly important point for some of<br>the trailing spouses so for example when<br>my husband and I moved to the US he was<br>on a intercompany transfer executive<br>visa an l1 which means I was on an l2<br>which gave me the right to apply for a<br>work permit so that I could then apply<br>for jobs if he'd been at a different<br>level he would have been employed given<br>an HB visa which meant I would have got<br>an hv2 visa which would have meant I<br>couldn't work so the technical aspects<br>of visas are really important and you<br>need to do your research if you're going<br>to live and work somewhere if a company<br>employs you and they sponsor you for a<br>visa that also means that your right to<br>live in that country is tied to that job<br>so if you leave the job you may have to<br>leave the country so lots of kind of<br>technical things to do with visas my the<br>main takeaway from this is really really<br>do your research so if you are being<br>moved by your own company you want to<br>find out what VZ Iran and what that<br>means for any partner you might be<br>taking with you if you are applying for<br>a job overseas and you're having to sort<br>out your own visas you know sometimes<br>it's actually worth employing a<br>consultant to actually help you with<br>this and then there are the cultural<br>norms around jobs so timeframes I<br>remember a few years ago there was a<br>number of articles in The Herald from<br>young people who had gone to London and<br>they are really disappointed by how long<br>it took them to get a job you know it<br>was taking them three months to get a<br>job six months to get a job and they<br>thought this was outrageous but the<br>reason it takes you six months to get a<br>job in the UK is that if you are<br>professional your notice period is three<br>months so do the math<br>so I resigned from my job I give a<br>3-month notice my company then decides<br>okay we need to advertise to find<br>someone new so it takes them a couple of<br>weeks to put the job ad out there there<br>are you know applications come in they<br>do the long listing they do the short<br>listing you know maybe a month six weeks<br>go by then they're ready to do some<br>interviews they do the first round of<br>interviews they do the second round of<br>interviews and then somewhere maybe two<br>months after I've resigned they make an<br>offer the person considers the offer<br>they accept the offer and then they<br>resign and they have to work out a three<br>months notice period so we very easily<br>get to six months now of course if you<br>are looking for quick employment you<br>might consider doing some temporary work<br>but if you're like no I'm going and I'm<br>going to get the perfect job do some<br>research find out what's actually going<br>on in the field that you're going into<br>don't assume it's going to be the same<br>as New Zealand because it probably won't<br>be tax and other deductions are totally<br>different and if you move around a lot<br>if you're a true Glo med and you're<br>moving every three or four years you<br>have this fabulous thing they call a<br>trailing tax liability which follows you<br>for many years to come and it means that<br>every tie every year you may have to do<br>two or three tax returns so we're<br>currently we've just moved back from the<br>u.s. we do a UK tax return we do a US<br>tax return and we do a New Zealand one<br>and I say we I mean a why does it but we<br>have to provide the paperwork and just<br>to make things even more fun New<br>Zealand's tax year runs from winter in<br>1st of April to 31st of March the UK is<br>6th of April 2/3 of April and the US was<br>the 1st of January to the 31st of<br>December so lots of fun so jobs I would<br>say talk to your employer if you work<br>for a multinational firm find out what<br>their policy is on providing overseas<br>opportunity what kind of relocation<br>packages they offer and really ask them<br>some you know deep questions on the<br>visas you can get in touch with local<br>recruiters than any other country and<br>kind of say this is what I'm thinking of<br>doing and then of course there are the<br>expat forums and I'm going to talk about<br>those a bit more coming up finding<br>somewhere to live is also probably<br>pretty high on your priority list it may<br>be the first thing that you want to do<br>but in lots of countries until you've<br>got a job you're not going to be able to<br>get a flat so looking into how you're<br>going to do this I would suggest if<br>you've got a place in mind you find a<br>Kiwis in the group so there's lots of<br>them Kiwis and Switzerland Kiwis and<br>Barcelona Kiwis everywhere and start<br>asking questions about how do I actually<br>find a flat you want to double-check<br>things like minimum lease and notice<br>periods again you know in countries like<br>the Netherlands and the UK you normally<br>have a fixed term lease and if you break<br>the lease you are still liable to pay<br>the rent until the end of the lease and<br>even if you give notice is probably<br>going to be something that you have to<br>give them three months notice on so even<br>with the leases set to end on a<br>particular day you still have to say<br>three months ahead of time whether you<br>want it to end on a particular day so<br>you know the New Zeeland kind of rental<br>market is very very different it's quite<br>fluid and then buying houses overseas is<br>even more complicated so I'm not going<br>to go into it if you want to find out<br>what it's like to buy and sell a house<br>in different countries go to one of<br>these Kiwis and forums and start asking<br>questions so just to give you some<br>examples of what might be different so<br>in the Netherlands if you get a flat and<br>unfurnished led it literally means there<br>is nothing in there when people move<br>they take their light fittings they take<br>their floorboards they take the kitchen<br>you so if you're only going for a short<br>period I'd suggest you find a furnished<br>flat pay a bit more it's definitely<br>worth it our one-year lease is standard<br>and be aware you are most likely going<br>to be signing a contract in a foreign<br>language so you want to find out you<br>know what you're actually doing so<br>multilingual lawyers are your friend and<br>the UK furnace flats are more common<br>again the one-year lease and the minimum<br>notice clauses are strictly enforced so<br>if you say you're going to leave earlier<br>you will still have to pay and the UK<br>buying and selling process is very<br>complicated so you know don't<br>necessarily assume that you're going to<br>move somewhere buy a place flip it when<br>you want to leave and it's all going to<br>go easily so do a bit of research in<br>America basically you can do whatever<br>you want you just have to pay for it so<br>if you have a one-year lease it'll be a<br>certain amount per month if you want a<br>six-month lease it'll be a little bit<br>more per month three months at a little<br>bit more month by month it will be more<br>expensive you want to check your lease<br>agreements to see what's included<br>because some will include your utilities<br>and some won't include your utilities so<br>shopping this is not rude this is Dutch<br>and lemonade MIT prick is just fizzy<br>lemonade so one of the things that I<br>kind of want to convey tonight is how<br>the little things are the things that<br>can be the most challenging so going to<br>the supermarket and you might sort of<br>think well if it's a foreign language I<br>kind of get that you know I'm not going<br>to be able to understand what it says<br>but even in English you may find that<br>there's different words for things the<br>brands are certainly different at the<br>moment you probably go to the<br>supermarket you go to the shop<br>you have your preferred brands and you<br>know you know what they say about you so<br>you know what you want<br>by so that it reflects the kind of<br>individual that you are and the values<br>that you have and then you turn up in<br>this foreign country and those brands<br>aren't there and all of a sudden you<br>know you're having this identity crisis<br>because you don't know what to buy so<br>you have to kind of start again allow at<br>least three times as long to do your<br>shopping and so so again in a foreign<br>country a foreign language you think<br>well that makes sense so you have to<br>learn your survival language you have to<br>learn what are the kind of basic things<br>that I need to understand you know if<br>you buy in still water or fizzy water<br>you want to know what the difference is<br>but even in an english-speaking country<br>you might be reading the labels more<br>closely than you do here so when I moved<br>to the States I would go to the whole<br>food shop because I knew that was<br>healthy and you know the one thing I<br>knew about America is that you can't<br>trust the food so I thought well I'll go<br>to Whole Foods because at least then<br>I'll know it's good food and I would<br>pick things up like I would pick up a<br>block of cheese and it would say no<br>added hormones and I think that's what<br>weird does that mean that if it doesn't<br>say no added hormones I should assume it<br>has added hormones ah so I put it back<br>and then I look again at the cheese and<br>then I try and find one that was an<br>American and I would buy that I put a<br>lot of Irish cheese and I trust the<br>Irish so you know you've got to allow<br>time to get used to things at this very<br>very granular level so and to be you<br>know kind of flummoxed and overwhelmed<br>and go with the shopping list and come<br>home with three centons the other things<br>that can happen quite often is that<br>things are sold in a different shop to<br>the one that you might expect so you<br>don't know where to buy certain things<br>and if you don't have any friends there<br>if you don't know anybody to ask you<br>spend a lot of time either trying to<br>find things online or wandering the<br>streets kind of wandering and shops and<br>sort of hoping that you stumble across<br>the<br>I'm not going to spend a lot of time on<br>safety other than to say that it's<br>really common to feel anxious and<br>unsecure because everything is new and<br>actually the people that I've<br>interviewed for my blog actually cite<br>feeling safe is the best thing about<br>coming back to New Zealand so some of<br>that to do with I think you know the<br>geographical isolation but a lot of it's<br>just psychological safety it's just<br>being that things are familiar so if you<br>kind of know what are the dodgy areas<br>you can avoid them you move to a new<br>city you don't know what the dodgy areas<br>are you'll be blissfully unaware as you<br>wander through them and it's not until<br>you know a local friends is I can't<br>believe you went there but you realize<br>that you were actually taking your life<br>into your hands ignorant can be bluffs<br>and you will adapt so we live we were in<br>London on 7-7 we were meant to go to<br>Cambridge that day we missed the Train<br>but you know you kind of adapt you like<br>oh well people are blowing up tubes to<br>just get on with your life<br>we were in Ealing during the Ealing the<br>London riots I was actually standing at<br>my window watching groups of young men<br>run up and down the street and on the TV<br>you know there were cars being burnt I<br>was in my pajamas I was looking at the<br>neighbours car thinking wonder if<br>someone's going to burn that car I<br>should probably go and get dressed<br>what will I do with the cat you know<br>these are the kinds of things you know<br>now my parents are watching it freaking<br>out thinking oh my god you and I'm and<br>in danger and I'm thinking well actually<br>my biggest concern was should I put my<br>clothes on and what am I going to do<br>with the cat you just adapt so don't<br>worry whatever you're seeing on the news<br>about what's going on in other parts of<br>the world if you live there this becomes<br>your normal and you you just hope you'll<br>be fine<br>belongings now I'm going to spend a bit<br>more time on this because this is<br>actually the thing that will make or<br>break your experience of bling blow made<br>and this is to do with a sense of<br>belonging to a place being part of a<br>community and at a very basic level<br>having friends now most of us haven't<br>had or hadn't had to make a new friend<br>as an adult you know we went to school<br>with people we went to university with<br>people people were sort of wonderfully<br>provided for us and close proximity with<br>shared interest and it was a relatively<br>simple thing to kind of find someone<br>that you like them you know form a<br>friendship and do things together when<br>you turn up in a new place and you don't<br>know anybody your phone never rings you<br>know you never get such an invitation to<br>do something so you actually have to go<br>out and literally meet dozens and dozens<br>of people proactively to try and make<br>new friends and there's some be really<br>daunting for people so a lot of people<br>don't do it and we see the impact of<br>that and the expat community we have<br>quite high levels of some mental health<br>issues around depression and anxiety we<br>have high levels of loneliness so it's<br>really really critical if you're going<br>to go and embark on this kind of<br>lifestyle that you actually get good at<br>putting yourself out there and<br>proactively meeting friends so I'm just<br>going to walk you through how I met some<br>of my friends and the 12 years that I<br>was overseas so you see some ideas about<br>how you might do this so if we start up<br>the top here that's me on the left the<br>girl in the middle of Viviana she's from<br>Mexico and this is Jocelyn she's from<br>New York and I met them in Rotterdam and<br>the way I did it was I actually met them<br>online so I sort of I was working in The<br>Hague for an international organization<br>that supported the international<br>community lots and lots of expert groups<br>in The Hague none that I knew of and<br>Rotterdam so I said you know is there<br>any group that you know of and they<br>people this was group<br>Rotterdam glam you know you could try<br>them and they've got an online forum<br>this is 2005 so this is before Facebook<br>this is before Meetup this is before<br>smartphones so I went online and I found<br>the forum and I wrote in hello I've just<br>moved to Rotterdam would anyone like to<br>meet for coffee and Viviana and Jocelyn<br>replied and so did a girl called Mary so<br>we all went out for coffee and Mary was<br>recalled to her home office a couple of<br>weeks later but the three of us became<br>best friends for probably the first two<br>years that I was in Rotterdam and we did<br>everything together and what was really<br>interesting is that when we got talking<br>we found out that we'd all move there<br>within a week of each other<br>so what had happened is that we'd all<br>got to that kind of same stage of the<br>cycle where we thought settle down we<br>found somewhere to live found jobs we<br>figured out how to do the shopping and<br>then we were ready to make some friends<br>who really kind of do that next step of<br>starting to build a community and that<br>actually rang true for all the friends<br>that I met so over the five and a half<br>years that I was there the ones that I<br>met in that first year had all arrived<br>and Rotterdam within a week or two of<br>each other so we all kind of went<br>through that process together so here's<br>a question for you if I was to say to a<br>bunch of you let's go out to dinner what<br>seven seven FETs okay one of the fun<br>segments about living abroad and having<br>international friends is that you<br>realize dinner is a cultural concept so<br>this is a group of friends and the<br>netherlands and when you say to them<br>what time shall we let's go for dinner<br>what time should we go the Dutch will go<br>six o'clock because you know that's when<br>dinner is the Dutch have lunch at 12:00<br>and dinner at 6:00 the Argentinians say<br>well not before tea<br>in because oh my god you know who would<br>eat before 10:00 the Italians are very<br>clear at 8 o'clock you have dinner at 8<br>o'clock and you have a spirits before<br>you eat and then you have your dinner<br>and then you have a digestive the Brits<br>are kind of like well you know 8 or 9<br>and we have to meet for drinks first<br>and the antipodean become like I don't<br>care I'll just set them with anybody and<br>the Canadians are kind of the same<br>although they probably go for 7 so you<br>know you meet these fabulous people and<br>then you suddenly realize that all your<br>assumptions about what's normal is<br>actually not true they're just<br>assumptions so this is our leaving party<br>so we've got Dutch Mexican Italian<br>Australian and Canadian this lovely lady<br>in the middle she's actually a Kiwi but<br>I met her in Rotterdam but this is her<br>wedding and in mark so the way that I<br>met her was that she developed a website<br>for Rotterdam and when she was moving to<br>Denmark she got in touch with the<br>International Organization I was working<br>with to ask if we wanted to take it over<br>and then we worked out that actually we<br>love five minutes apart from each other<br>and Rotterdam we could have been best<br>friends the whole time but we are good<br>friends now she now lives back in New<br>Zealand having gone through various<br>countries and I went the other way so<br>when we moved to London the only person<br>I knew was this girl her name's<br>Katherine and I knew her because she<br>worked with me and Rotterdam and she'd<br>come over she's English but she'd come<br>over to live was a Dutch boyfriend and<br>the relationship had ended so she's gone<br>back to England but she wanted to keep a<br>job so I said well our boss said you can<br>work remotely if you come over every<br>month or so so she would come over and<br>she would stay with me so we became<br>friends and when I moved to London she<br>was the only person that I knew so when<br>we were trying to figure out we were<br>going to live she was the person I was<br>emailing going what are the good areas<br>Adam up the top there I met him and his<br>wife through a friend in London when<br>they came to flat set for us we were<br>going overseas I put a little note on a<br>message board saying does anyone know<br>someone who'd want to flats that Adams<br>Australian but that's actually us from<br>Seattle because he travels about 25 days<br>a month and so when he was passing<br>through Seattle we would catch up for a<br>coffee so you're starting to see how you<br>meet these people through all sorts of<br>different cycles and then you kind of<br>they become part of your friendship<br>world and they're very international<br>this is Casey she I met her in Seattle<br>at an international event and the<br>toilets and she's actually seriously<br>beggars can't be choosers you will<br>befriend anyone not emotion it's one of<br>my favorite feasel in the world<br>originally from New York but she had<br>been living in the north of England for<br>25 years and her and her husband had<br>decided as their kind of you know last<br>hurrah they were going to come to<br>America and have this adventure<br>especially my cousins in New York who<br>now lives back in Auckland and this is<br>Joe who's a New Zealander that we met in<br>Seattle and he now loves beckon rail<br>Mattie and we met him at a Seattle<br>Christchurch sister city association<br>yono went on up from Christchurch but<br>they went bit buggy and we needed<br>friends so off we win so when you when<br>you move to a new place<br>if you move somewhere like London the<br>tendency will be to stick to your own<br>there are hundreds of thousands of New<br>Zealanders and you could probably spend<br>decades would never actually meet anyone<br>other than a New Zealander I would<br>really encourage you not to do that if<br>you're going overseas to have an<br>overseas experience but there are times<br>in the process where you will just be<br>feeling like you need a bit of<br>familiarity and you know someone that<br>you don't have to translate for<br>so that can be quite handy to have a few<br>Kiwi friends the other thing that you<br>will get used to is that you just leave<br>a piece of your heart everywhere that<br>you go<br>you know whenever you move you make<br>these friendships they're often quite<br>deep friendships because you've gone<br>through some challenging times together<br>and then you leave them and start again<br>you know so their life goes on you're<br>not really a part of it you're now<br>making new friends and vesting and the<br>relationships that you have now do you<br>kind of get used to that as you move<br>around you leave a little bit of<br>yourself everywhere you go the other<br>thing that kind of happens is that you<br>get really good at filling at home<br>everywhere you know growing where you're<br>planted doing this quite quickly but you<br>also feel at home nowhere because you're<br>kind of always temporary you're always<br>transient and often the people that you<br>befriend and the relationships that you<br>have are with people who are very very<br>similar to you so it can be a kind of a<br>strange existence and that sense and<br>then something I'm going to talk about<br>and a little bit is that this kind of<br>lifestyle can also put an enormous<br>strain on relationship so if any of you<br>are thinking of kind of heading off with<br>a new partner wait till I've done my bit<br>on relationships and then self esteem so<br>ever think what makes you feel good<br>about yourself right now like how do you<br>know that you're a good person that<br>you're a worthy person and how much of<br>this is dependent on external settings<br>so how much of your sense of self do you<br>get from where you enter University or<br>where you went to school or your<br>position and the community or who your<br>family is so now imagine all of that<br>stripped away you've turned up in this<br>new place no one's even heard of New<br>Zealand let alone the University you<br>went to let alone the school that you<br>went to<br>maybe you don't even have your job<br>anymore<br>maybe you're the trailing spouse and<br>you've just gone along so you have none<br>of that<br>what do you where you get your<br>self-esteem from where you get your<br>sense of self-worth that's another<br>really important set of skills and<br>abilities that you need to develop if<br>you're going to embark on this lifestyle<br>you need to be able to figure out who<br>you really are independently of all<br>these kind of external markers around<br>you and for a lot of people it's a good<br>self-actualization I'm not going to talk<br>about this those who know this model<br>know that when you star factual eyes you<br>become yourself some people do become<br>themselves they go overseas and they<br>find that once they're stripped of all<br>those external markers and all those<br>influences that form to them they can<br>actually be themselves other people lose<br>themselves and they kind of become a<br>turd about by the wings of change to the<br>point that they don't really know who<br>they are if you get to this point you<br>probably if you like me you've probably<br>just got to kind of level four and then<br>you're off to the new place so it<br>doesn't matter because you're going to<br>be back to figuring out where to live<br>and you know what cheese to buy so why<br>do it well I think the best metaphor<br>that I like for this is to think of<br>yourself like this little plant down<br>here so when you start off you're kind<br>of this little pot little plant and a<br>pot and you fill the whole pot and then<br>every time you move somewhere you go<br>into a bigger pot and the pots are bit<br>big for you so we have to grow to fit<br>you have to put down some roots you have<br>to expand you know you have to kind of<br>grow and the more that you do it the<br>more you kind of grow yourself as a<br>person you learn more about yourself you<br>learn what you're capable of<br>it's the most humbling and<br>confidence-building experience I've ever<br>had an equal measure so humbling because<br>you get stripped of all your external<br>attributes so it's really your<br>personality and character that will<br>determine your experience so if you go<br>out you know hunting for new friends and<br>these people don't know anything about<br>you they're not friends of friends they<br>haven't been introduced you're not part<br>of the same social circles your ability<br>to make close new friends to meet these<br>people from different cultures to kind<br>of you know develop these sorts of<br>relationships that comes down to you and<br>when you work out that you can actually<br>do that that's an enormous boost to your<br>self-esteem constantly being put in the<br>position of the novice helps you get<br>really good at learning so then nothing<br>becomes unmanageable over time the first<br>time you have to do any sentence and<br>when you live as a glow maid you're<br>always having to do things for the first<br>time you learn how to do it so when you<br>then get faced with a new challenge or a<br>new dilemma you have some confidence<br>that you're going to be able to figure<br>it out because you figured everything<br>else out up until that point every time<br>you do something new and scary you add<br>to what you're capable of<br>so you build your self-esteem from the<br>inside out so a lot of people get<br>self-esteem from external markers so<br>they get it from you know their job or<br>what they achieve or what other people<br>think of them but when you start to kind<br>of do these things for yourself and set<br>those challenges for yourself that<br>really builds it from the inside out and<br>it doesn't matter all that external<br>stuff is in stripped away from you again<br>you carry that with you you develop the<br>skills of agility and resilience because<br>when you move to a foreign place you<br>can't control anything<br>nothing works so when will first moved<br>to the Netherlands we still had our kind<br>of key<br>mentality with us we thought anything<br>could be solved with a quick phone call<br>to somebody and you know you just<br>explain the situation and she'd be right<br>mate no this is not how it happens in<br>the Netherlands and the Netherlands you<br>just have to fit in and follow the<br>process and so after a while you work<br>out that that's what you do when we move<br>to England things were done differently<br>again and you you know you're kind of<br>bash your head against it for a few<br>months thinking well like figure out you<br>know kind of the right thing to say but<br>no that doesn't work and of course what<br>you're carrying with you now is normal<br>is not the New Zealand way it's the<br>Dutch way so now you think the Brits are<br>weird because they're not like the Dutch<br>who you used to think were weird because<br>they weren't like the Kiwis resiliance<br>experience is what you get when you<br>don't get what you want living this kind<br>of lifestyle will put you through<br>enormous challenges you know there will<br>be times that you're thinking I don't<br>know what I was thinking doing this but<br>you get through it and you learn that<br>you can cope interestingly these are two<br>of the most sought-after competencies<br>and the business world today for exactly<br>that reason and the business we never<br>know what's coming so we have to be<br>agile we have to be able to adapt and we<br>need to be resilient lots and lots of<br>setbacks so one of the reasons that we<br>send young emerging leaders off to<br>foreign markets to get this experience<br>is to build these various skills because<br>if we know that somebody has been you<br>know moved from you know London to<br>Jakarta or moved to China or moved to<br>the Middle East and they've been able to<br>work there they've been able to live<br>there they've been able to be effective<br>in their job then they're going to have<br>some really valuable skills that mean<br>that if they go into the kind of role<br>that's really uncertain they're dealing<br>with a lot of ambiguity they're going to<br>be much better at that than somebody<br>who's never actually had to deal with<br>that kind of ambiguity in their own life<br>and you get to be you so this is a kind<br>of interesting one so some people<br>find this a real challenge but if you<br>discover your self in a foreign land<br>with snow no one has any expectations of<br>you nobody knows who you are you get to<br>figure out what you actually like and<br>what you don't like and what you stand<br>for so for some people it can be kind of<br>a process of figuring that out for the<br>first time if up until that point<br>they've always kind of done what their<br>parents expected of them or they've<br>always kind of followed the crowd in<br>terms of what their friends have done<br>and so it can be quite a liberating sort<br>of experience so the practicalities if<br>you are between 18 and 35 and you want<br>to have a taster I would suggest that<br>you get a working holiday visa now<br>there's about 30 countries I think it is<br>in the world that New Zealanders can get<br>a working holiday visa to so you don't<br>have to just go to London you don't just<br>have to go to Australia you can go to<br>all sorts of interesting places lots of<br>countries in Europe the Netherlands<br>Germany and it's pretty straightforward<br>always double check with the embassy<br>because things can change and I would<br>say still on what's happening in Europe<br>and America at the moment like really<br>triple check and just make sure that the<br>old regulations you know that the<br>regulations are not out of date if you<br>are older than 35 then you're probably<br>going to need to find either an internal<br>company transfer and so let HR know that<br>you're keen I know from my own<br>experience as a talent manager that we<br>were always at the strategic level<br>wanting to move people around our<br>different markets but if people didn't<br>tell us that we couldn't look out for<br>opportunities for them so if I would<br>talk to people and they would say you<br>know I've got a real interest and you<br>know being in the Asian market or<br>something then I could kind of point<br>them in the right direction or have<br>their name and my<br>if something came up but if you're just<br>sitting there thinking god I wish I<br>could go and work overseas and you don't<br>tell anybody it's very unlikely that<br>they're going to come to you with that<br>opportunity also have a look in your<br>internal job boards if you work for<br>multinational companies they'll probably<br>post all the vacancies internally and<br>you know kind of keep following up on<br>that check out job boards and other<br>countries if you have a real skill set<br>most big companies will pay to relocate<br>you sub headhunters and other countries<br>will even contact you for job<br>opportunities abroad so you know keep<br>your LinkedIn profile up-to-date if you<br>are interested in working overseas you<br>might even want to I don't know if you<br>can do that indicate you're interested<br>in jobs overseas or if you just need to<br>you know for interested in jobs and see<br>what comes up one of the good things<br>about New Zealand is that we can have as<br>many passports as we want so if you have<br>a parent or a grandparent who has a<br>passport for a different country you can<br>probably get one of those and then that<br>will take care of your visa issues as<br>well so kind of tour through the family<br>tree see what passports you can get in<br>terms of housing customs<br>social networks that sort of things I<br>would read up on what to expect on some<br>of the local forums so there's a website<br>called expat accurse calm and Europe it<br>covers a number of European countries<br>and it has all sorts of information<br>everything from jobs to housing you know<br>there are all sorts of little articles<br>like you know why does the Dutch do this<br>why does the Germans behave like that<br>give you little insights into some of<br>the cultural nuances and often they will<br>have kind of boards that you can post a<br>question so if you've got a particular<br>question you can usually get it answered<br>my blog is mainly on repatriation but in<br>the interviews you can read some of the<br>stories of people who have gone overseas<br>and<br>I think the most interesting thing about<br>those is how few of them actually none<br>of them did what they thought they were<br>going to do so they all went off<br>thinking that their overseas experience<br>is going to go one way and it went some<br>very different directions so I think<br>it's good to kind of have a just a<br>flavor of what might happen if you are<br>thinking of heading off you can go on<br>Google and just type an expat and put in<br>the country name and find other forums<br>there's pretty much always in Australia<br>New Zealand group everywhere you go in<br>the world so you can kind of tap into<br>them again as a source of information<br>and when you first arrive you know<br>they're good for social engagements and<br>the Netherlands I don't think the<br>Ambassador had much to do because I was<br>having parties at their house and if<br>you're one of the New Zealanders and<br>Holland you always get invited so you<br>know it's worth kind of connecting up<br>with these New Zealand societies aboard<br>here network is anyone already a member<br>of the Kea Network anyone heard of the<br>Kea Network okay so I'm going to tell<br>them they'll be horrified the care<br>network is a global network which<br>represents the kind of Kiwi diaspora and<br>their focus is mainly on trade and<br>creating opportunities for New<br>Zealanders who want to do business<br>abroad so if you were trying to get into<br>the American market or the European<br>market there'll be some representatives<br>who would kind of help you do that they<br>also hold lots of social events overseas<br>they have some interesting speakers and<br>then they publicize New Zealand events<br>in your local area<br>so when I was in Seattle it was from Kia<br>that I would always know when breeds<br>were in town playing in you know the<br>revamped LMNOP you know all this kind of<br>stuff so if you join these networks you<br>can kind of get us<br>sense of what's going on and connect<br>them that way<br>informations anyone a member of<br>intonation here so this is another<br>international organization and they have<br>an Oakland chapter and it will be mainly<br>foreigners who live and work in New<br>Zealand and I would go along for a<br>couple of reasons one it's a really good<br>place to practice hello will you be my<br>friend and two it's a really good place<br>to find out from people who love this<br>kind of globe mad at lifestyle you know<br>what it's like and you know you can even<br>just ask them what was it like when you<br>came to New Zealand you know what did<br>you find that was different what was<br>unusual to give you a sense of the kind<br>of experiences that you might have when<br>you go somewhere else<br>okay relationships so normally when<br>you're talking about careers you don't<br>talk about relationships but if you're<br>going to be aglow mad and if you're<br>going to either travel with a partner or<br>you know have fine people when you're<br>over there you actually have to consider<br>this so from a practical perspective<br>look into the visa regulations as I said<br>before some countries will have<br>different variations on whether a spouse<br>can work depending on the level of the<br>visa that the person gets some countries<br>will only allow one member of the couple<br>to have a work visa so when I was in my<br>job in London we were moving someone<br>from America to our Istanbul office and<br>her husband was coming with her or her<br>partner was coming with her and he had<br>sourced a job and we thought this was<br>fabulous and then we found out that if<br>they were married the Turkish government<br>would only give one of them a work visa<br>so the race was odd we wanted the visa<br>for our person<br>and then we found out that they weren't<br>married which solve the visa problem but<br>which brings me to my next point some<br>countries will only allow you to bring<br>import your partner with you if you are<br>legally married if you are not legally<br>married and that means married<br>it doesn't mean de facto your New<br>Zealand standing has no bearing and<br>other countries you need to you know<br>kind of way that up not all countries<br>acknowledge same-sex marriage so if<br>that's you and you're wanting to travel<br>as a couple you might need to look into<br>which countries are going to be safe for<br>you to go into and then if you do have<br>children you want to consider schooling<br>options for children and who will pay<br>for this<br>now most most glow meds most people that<br>move around a lot every three or four<br>years put their kids in international<br>schools and that's for a couple of<br>reasons one is the international schools<br>generally have a curriculum the same<br>curriculum in every country so it's<br>easier for the children academically to<br>kind of move from faced from place to<br>place the other reason is that they be<br>usually all taught in English or French<br>there's a French Network as well or<br>German but the language of instruction<br>is the same so the kids don't have to<br>kind of become proficient in every<br>language of the country that you move to<br>but of course you know these are<br>fiercely expensive you know we're<br>talking hundreds of thousands of dollars<br>over the course of that assignment if<br>you've got you know a couple of kids so<br>if you are moving yourself and you want<br>to put your kids into the international<br>schools then you need to think about<br>negotiating that kind of enter your<br>package if you're accepting a job if the<br>company is moving you then you want to<br>make sure that's a part of your deal if<br>you want to put your kids into the local<br>school<br>and some people really want to do this<br>because they're like no we want to have<br>the full emotion experience want because<br>- they're in the language and all the<br>rest of it you need to do some research<br>and find out whether that's actually<br>going to be possible because not all<br>countries will allow a temporary<br>resident and their kids to kind of go<br>into the school and then if there's a<br>language issue you need to think about<br>how you're going to work around that as<br>well so all solvable hundreds of<br>thousands if not millions of people do<br>this every year but they're just things<br>to kind of consider and do your research<br>on the deeper stuff so the divorce rate<br>in each community is higher than in the<br>general population not surprising<br>considering that the strains that your<br>relationship can come under especially<br>if it's just the two of you and you<br>haven't gotten the other friends and<br>then all of a sudden you have to be<br>everything to each other and it's all a<br>bit new and difficult and you know you<br>take it out on each other so it's really<br>really important if you're thinking<br>about doing this and you have a<br>significant other to be honest about<br>your priorities and your values you will<br>be tested and - safe - personal<br>experience my husband and I did get<br>married while we were overseas and we<br>are still together so it can make you<br>stronger as a couple but it can also<br>kind of show up any cracks that you've<br>got in the relationship so you need to<br>be really clear on whether you have the<br>same priorities and you want the same<br>things out of life because if you're<br>kind of going and you're dragging<br>someone with you who doesn't really want<br>to go that's probably not going to end<br>very well yeah so the most common cause<br>of assignment failure is an unhappy<br>spouse and of course that can have<br>career implications so if you do choose<br>the spouse over the job and you leave<br>the assignment you know you have to<br>think about what what might that<br>actually mean in terms of my future<br>prospects with this company so you know<br>kind of lots to think about<br>increasing your globality quotient so<br>you can actually develop some of these<br>skills while you're here in New Zealand<br>so practice making new friends<br>managing loneliness is the hardest part<br>about being a go meant we see high<br>levels of workaholism alcohol and drug<br>use depression and anxiety and the expat<br>community if you are thinking of doing<br>this I would start trying to make some<br>new friends now to kind of develop some<br>of those skills and put yourself out of<br>your comfort zone<br>it's very tip now so when in has a<br>problem problem when I went because<br>there was no social media so I couldn't<br>stay in touch with my friends online but<br>what I hear now is that some people kind<br>of are doing this and they're trying to<br>maintain online relationships with old<br>friends rather than making new ones and<br>that's actually making them even more<br>lonely and depressed for a couple of<br>reasons one they have no sense of<br>belonging and the community where they<br>love and the other is that they feel<br>like they're on the outside looking in<br>to what their old friends are doing so<br>they kind of feel betwixt in between and<br>are not part of anything there's lots of<br>ways that you can meet new people and<br>internationally focus people in New<br>Zealand there's lots of meetup groups<br>now there's intonations you know there<br>are care events so you can start to kind<br>of get a little bit involved in this<br>kind of international climatic community<br>while you're here and get a sense of<br>what it's like and you know whether<br>you'd like to be a part of it the other<br>thing you need to do because if you move<br>overseas and you're setting up and you<br>haven't got any friends you don't have a<br>lot of time on your hands so you can<br>need to cultivate the ability to be<br>alone so if you had a whole week for a<br>whole month to yourself and you knew<br>that the phone wasn't going to ring no<br>one was going to invite you anywhere<br>there's going to be nothing kind of no<br>family events to go to there's kind of<br>nothing you had nothing to do how would<br>you spend your time<br>what would you actually do so I think<br>one thing that's really important if<br>you're thinking about embarking on this<br>kind of life is to think about some<br>location and dependent hobbies and<br>interests starting a mindfulness<br>practice is useful because it helps you<br>manage the kind of rollercoaster of<br>emotions and that's something that you<br>can do now yeah so one thing about this<br>was kind of interesting so remember my<br>friend who moved to Jakarta overladen<br>her name was so this was three years ago<br>and I said to her you know what makes<br>you feel like you you know what makes<br>you feel like you're yourself because<br>she was totally you know a lot and I did<br>for me it's yoga so I can go anywhere in<br>the world I can walk into a yoga studio<br>get on my mat and I feel like I'm home<br>and she has a lot coming Swimming's how<br>I feel so she went awesome she joined a<br>German she started swimming and she<br>started working out and all the rest of<br>it and she discovered that in Jakarta<br>this was actually quite difficult to do<br>because you know she's female and you<br>know the norms are very different and<br>all the rest of she kind of went through<br>this process and she kept it up and<br>that's here she köppen daddy male-only<br>gym with a local Indonesian woman so she<br>actually took her location under pendant<br>hobby that gave her her kind of sanity<br>made her feel like herself in this new<br>place and she's actually ended up making<br>that into a business<br>so her career as a talent managers<br>probably over she wasn't allowed to work<br>in Jakarta she couldn't get a work visa<br>she had to figure out who she was<br>independent of a very successful career<br>that she had for the past 15 years and<br>this is kind of where she's ended up so<br>you know life when you go on the road<br>you never quite know where the roads<br>going to take you but sometimes it can<br>take you to some pretty cool places so<br>one kind of final slide before I open<br>the floor to questions when you start<br>talking to people about their overseas<br>lives they will tell you lots of horror<br>story<br>so for example you might have been in<br>Holland six weeks you've applied for a<br>residence permit you've been turned down<br>the Dutch government's threatening to<br>deport you TV doesn't work keeps<br>threatened to sue your landlord you're<br>not sure if you'll be a vectored give no<br>friends and Sunday closing is driving<br>you mad six months time sponsored as a<br>knowledge migrant you've got a great new<br>job fabulous circle of friends in the<br>Albert Heijn that's local supermarkets<br>just announced I'll be open on Sunday<br>afternoons and the lead-up to Christmas<br>or you're in the u.s. supporting your<br>husband's career only to find that why<br>do you have a work permit the UK<br>qualification you have isn't recognized<br>so you can't actually do what you were<br>planning to do two years later you're<br>headlining at a national conference<br>talking about global perspectives on<br>work-life balance having being talked<br>into it by your new friend and<br>award-winning author and documentary<br>maker both of those things happen to me<br>and I survived and these sorts of things<br>will happen to you too and you will get<br>through them and you will survive and in<br>your you know tell people about it at<br>parties and they'll think it's hilarious<br>you know there's become some of your<br>best stories of the time I almost got<br>deported remember the time I was held up<br>at the Dutch border and put in the room<br>with all the other illegals while they<br>checked so paper would look great cool<br>all right so I think we've now got about<br>20 minutes for questions anyone want to<br>hmm negotiation so you so in Holland<br>that was actually quite easy because all<br>the kitchens and the restaurants closed<br>at 9:00 so we sort of had a window and<br>we would normally kind of go sort of for<br>the middle ground and then sometimes you<br>do like a rolling dinner so some people<br>would come at 6:00 I mean some would<br>come as season and some will come at<br>8:00 so you just kind of negotiate and<br>and just really roll roll with us I<br>think yes thank you yeah yeah so for me<br>just the same reasons that we left with<br>it were the reasons that we kept moving<br>and it was to do with when things became<br>predictable I got bored and so I wanted<br>to go somewhere new so that was what<br>prompted us to leave New Zealand that's<br>what sent us to the UK and then when we<br>were in the UK we were actually going to<br>come back to New Zealand and then we got<br>asked to go to the US and it fit diddly<br>so we just thought well why not so we're<br>kind of good and the priority was always<br>the experience rather than anything else<br>so if someone offered us kind of an<br>interesting opportunity to go and live<br>somewhere we would take it and the<br>timetable of it you kind of go after<br>four or five years or you tend to stay<br>so those friends that I made who arrived<br>at the same time as me most of them are<br>still there the viana took the glymed<br>thing to a whole new level and she would<br>kind of move countries every three<br>months I have no idea where she is at<br>the moment I've lost track because she's<br>not on site<br>Media you've been and again she emails<br>me say hello I'm living in the Maldives<br>Wow<br>but the others they stayed and they're<br>essentially immigrants now they love<br>them they live in Holland it takes a<br>year to go through there's a<br>well-documented cycle you can look it up<br>online of the first year and you kind of<br>go through a honeymoon period then you<br>hate everything then you kind of remove<br>yourself from the host culture so you so<br>that's when you retreat into anything<br>that's kind of familiar so you hang out<br>with lots of Kiwis and Ozzy's because<br>overseas are these are honorary Kiwis<br>they'll do close enough and then by the<br>end of the year you're kind of well it's<br>you know I like this but I don't like<br>that and then you sort of start to<br>settle them properly but I think it's<br>probably not until your third year that<br>you really feel like I live here things<br>are familiar you know I I know my way<br>around and you've done most things that<br>you're going to do for the first time<br>you've done most of them so you've you<br>know done a tax return and you've and I<br>got a haircut and you know all these<br>kinds of things so all those things that<br>you're doing for the first time you've<br>usually done most of them by the time<br>you're in your third year it doesn't get<br>faster but you know what's coming and<br>that I for me makes it easier you so<br>rather than thinking oh my god I've made<br>the worst mistake of my life I'm you<br>know I don't know what I was thinking<br>you just think oh I'm in that phase<br>where I had everything you know so you<br>still go through it you still hate<br>everything but you understand better<br>the biggest challenge making friends<br>making friends is the biggest challenge<br>because you I'm not a natural extrovert<br>so I had friends who were just the motor<br>just amazing at this they would be out<br>every single night and a different group<br>kind of meeting people you know forming<br>friendships whereas I would kind of go<br>and then I would you know I talked to<br>like 300 people only like one of them<br>you know and it's kind of difficult to<br>sort of do that so you really have to<br>put yourself out there and just a lot of<br>frogs until you actually meet the people<br>that are going to be your friends yeah<br>that's a good question<br>um it depends a bit on how you're moving<br>so if you are being moved by company<br>they will probably pay your relocation<br>cost so your furniture they might put<br>you up for the first couple of months<br>and corporate housing but you do go out<br>and buy quite a lot of stuff I don't<br>think there's a figure that's going to<br>apply to every country so what I would<br>do is get on to the forum and the place<br>that you're thinking of going and ask<br>people how much is it going to cost<br>because for example if you are renting<br>you might have to provide you know first<br>and last month's rent plus a bond and<br>that might be you know for somewhere<br>like New York or Hong Kong there might<br>be tens of thousands of dollars and if<br>it was a few into Cambodia or Burma<br>would probably be a lot less so you need<br>to kind of do a bit of research and find<br>that out but I would if you don't have a<br>guaranteed job to go to you'd also want<br>to do some<br>Sergent kind of living costs I mean<br>maybe allow for so six months that you<br>could support yourself yes most of your<br>country see room were speaking yep in<br>Holland the to learn the language much<br>or was it much of an obstacle I mean was<br>it did it make it that much harder than<br>being in an Anglo country no actually<br>most foreign country I lived in was the<br>u.s. not Holland and so I learned<br>survival Dutch so I learn how to<br>recognize food so I could order food at<br>a restaurant and do the shopping if you<br>learn a language you could understand a<br>lot more than you can speak so often you<br>would have conversations with some they<br>would speak Dutch and you would speak<br>English and you both understand each<br>other professionally I worked in an<br>International Business School where the<br>business language was English and one of<br>the reasons I was employed was to raise<br>the standard of English in the<br>department so we weren't allowed to<br>speak Dutch but I think socially it<br>would have helped of my Dutchman's<br>better because the Dutch has this great<br>tradition of clubs everyone belongs to<br>clubs and if I if I'd had been<br>profession I probably could have gone to<br>more things socially like that and the<br>reason a miracle is the most foreign<br>place was actually not just the politics<br>but it's because they have the imperial<br>system so I couldn't understand the<br>weather forecast so or and every time I<br>went to cook something you know using a<br>recipe I would have to Google what is<br>180 degrees centigrade and Fahrenheit so<br>that I would know what to temperature to<br>set the oven to so as little lots of<br>little things like that you know make<br>any other questions up from down the<br>back here what about when you're<br>preparing to leave a country visit your<br>home country or yep one that you've been<br>living on what are the practicalities<br>about outside of talk to the tech<br>modules yeah yeah it's not a good tip it<br>relates a little bit to your point I<br>would say take half as much stuff and<br>twice as much money so you know that<br>kind of old adage about traveling so<br>even if you try not to you will<br>accumulate things and often people will<br>put them in storage thinking that<br>they're going to want them in the future<br>no one ever wants it right so just get<br>rid of it all if you are so that would<br>be my first thing so look at your things<br>and think okay what do I really need to<br>take with me other practicalities are to<br>do with I mean really<br>little things like changing your<br>addresses and stuff like that so for<br>example I've got a situation now we've<br>got you know American Netflix while we<br>do have new is New Zealand Netflix but<br>it's linked to our u.s. credit card and<br>our u.s. credit card and bank accounts<br>still have our Us address because the<br>way that the credit cards are verified<br>is via your address so if I change it to<br>our New Zealand address and then I<br>wanted to buy something I wouldn't it<br>would cancel the card so I left<br>everything in the American situation but<br>the cards are expiring so they've seen<br>new cards to our old address so I'm kind<br>of like well what do I do now do I kind<br>of put out the credit cards or so it's<br>these little things which are not very<br>important but they're just kind of stuff<br>that you might want to take into account<br>so if you're thinking about leaving New<br>Zealand and going overseas it's that<br>sort of thing like when you what are you<br>going to do with your bank accounts here<br>you<br>are you going to take your credit card<br>with you do you need to talk to your<br>bank here about what happens what funds<br>set up over there can I change the<br>address the what you take with you<br>really have a good look at what you're<br>thinking of keeping this is what you're<br>going to take yes someone had a question<br>here and here you were changes the u.s.<br>this new administration<br>I am aware that there is a lot of<br>discussion about changing the visas and<br>so I would at the time that you're going<br>to get it that would be the time to ask<br>the questions and find out what's the<br>current status and the US has dozens and<br>dozens of categories of visas so it's if<br>you're doing it yourself I would hire a<br>lawyer who can actually advise you an<br>immigration consultant if you can<br>actually advise you someone that's in<br>the US if your company is doing that<br>they should have somebody doing that for<br>you so it's usually ey or KPMG who does<br>the the tax and immigration for company<br>moves and you were talking about<br>trailing tax liabilities you're moving<br>around different places is that only<br>relevant if you're still generating<br>income in those countries or why is that<br>that you still liable protection ah yes<br>I use it somewhere yeah so yes it's<br>depends on whether you are still<br>generating income and that can be for<br>all sorts of reasons so you might have<br>cashed in some shares or have if you<br>have a property in New Zealand and you<br>have rental income so there's all sorts<br>of reasons that you might have it and<br>then you may have no income but you<br>might still be required to file a tax<br>return and that year<br>so it's something if you're moving a lot<br>and you if you think that applies to you<br>I would say get a good accountant<br>someone that is experienced and the<br>international kind of tax law and if you<br>are moving with a company it's like the<br>number one thing to ask for when you're<br>negotiating your relocation package that<br>you want that tech support for at least<br>you know a year or two after the<br>assignments finished Thanks all right<br>well you have a tax during the country<br>that you live in so how did you manage<br>to deal with starting all over again I<br>was attached to people in the different<br>countries and I think the way I managed<br>it was to to maintain those<br>relationships so when I moved from the<br>Netherlands to London I would go I<br>actually was quite funny I ended up<br>becoming a client of my former employer<br>so I would go to Holland and I would<br>catch up with my friends by that stage<br>Facebook had come along which was<br>remarkable and you know Skype<br>conversations that kind of thing but the<br>countries themselves you to stay sane<br>one thing that you really need to be<br>able to do is to move somewhere and life<br>instantly kind of forget that you ever<br>lived there because otherwise you spend<br>way too much time living in the past and<br>then you can't really start to live in<br>your new home all right any other<br>questions<br>excuse a optimum age or like changing<br>the life to do this nope<br>now any age when I was in London there<br>were women coming over in their fifties<br>and you know they kind of had their kids<br>because growing up gone they've had<br>their career here and they just wanted a<br>bit of time to explore they set<br>themselves up they traveled they got<br>great jobs you know so I think any age<br>is a good age to do it on the back of<br>that do you think once you become as<br>glow mat is ever strong they feel better<br>he can imagine you do like you said and<br>yeah do you feel settled or do you still<br>feel like it's going to be in your<br>opportunity at the site I I think it's<br>it's a great lifestyle one of the<br>reasons that we came back was you know<br>so there were some cool factors to do as<br>parents and all the rest of it but for<br>me it had become predictable so coming<br>back to New Zealand this is actually<br>really different but I've got no doubt<br>that we'll go somewhere in the future<br>and I think most people who live this<br>way kind of feel the same so you know<br>they might go back to their home country<br>for a number of years but they'd never<br>rule out going and living somewhere else<br>overseas<br>going to this country what did you like<br>the reason no well I mean as I said I<br>mean my first experience was when I was<br>four so I think the die was kind of cast<br>fairly early on and then my my Oita<br>Scotland I didn't do that very well I<br>didn't you know I was in Edinburgh and<br>my boyfriend at the time was Scottish<br>and we didn't we knew a couple of people<br>but we didn't really know people we have<br>worked all the time and travelled and we<br>didn't kind of really establish<br>ourselves there so I knew that that was<br>the wrong way to do it so when I went to<br>the Netherlands I kind of worked out<br>what I hadn't done and my previous<br>experience so I was really really<br>proactive about invest<br>that time and then I took that as my key<br>learning so when I moved to London I<br>negotiated with my employer to work<br>virtually for them for six months so<br>that I would actually have time to go<br>and put all the you know time and energy<br>into meeting people so that I wouldn't<br>just be kind of working you know there's<br>12-hour london days and it was an ant<br>allied established a social network that<br>i was like okay well now i can go and<br>get a you know a local job where i don't<br>how much of a disadvantage is that to<br>the person looking yeah do you sort of<br>push it well with one side that's a<br>candidate with someone there's not<br>present or my able to be present it<br>depends on on your skill set and how how<br>sought-after you are so I mean there's<br>no doubt that being physically present<br>as an advantage because what that shows<br>is that you're serious and you're you've<br>made that commitment to move because<br>sometimes people will say that they're<br>coming but you know that they're not<br>they haven't even spoken to their wives<br>I said be in recruitment before I left<br>New Zealand and we would recruit a lot<br>of people over from the UK and Australia<br>and we often get to sit a third<br>interview stage and be ready to offer<br>them the guys in a bit a talk this over<br>with my wife who's been completely<br>oblivious the whole time so I would say<br>if you are really serious and you can go<br>go and apply on the ground but certainly<br>get in touch with recruiters overseas<br>and kind of let them know that you're<br>around because they'll be the ones who<br>send you the opportunities and for sure<br>companies will bring you over if you're<br>the right person and you've got a rare<br>skill set that they're looking for<br>because the alternative is they don't<br>hire anyone and you know there doesn't<br>work well depends on the country so that<br>is so there's the ease of there's<br>different elements so there's the energy<br>s was the easiest because it's public<br>and it's free at the point of service so<br>you just rock up to a doctor or a<br>hospital but every country has its own<br>rules so in the UK and in the<br>Netherlands for example there are only<br>certain medical centers or hospitals<br>that you can go to depending on either<br>where you love or what insurance you<br>have in the US your health insurance<br>will usually be provided by your<br>employer and then that health insurer<br>will tell you which hospitals that<br>covers in which practitioners that<br>covers so again if particularly if<br>you're going to go to the US even Canada<br>but the u.s. in particular you know this<br>is something that you really do want to<br>look into because there is no safety net<br>so if you don't have health insurance<br>then you will have to pay for any<br>treatment that you get and it will run<br>into the tens of thousands you there are<br>also some reciprocal agreements between<br>certain countries so you again you know<br>maybe you want to look into that but if<br>you are living in a place and you're<br>paying local tax to that country and it<br>has a social welfare system that<br>includes health then you will probably<br>be covered but you might just need to<br>find out whether you need to register<br>with a particular doctor's surgery or a<br>particular dentist according to the area<br>that you love and these are the sorts of<br>questions that are really good to ask<br>the expert forums the people who are<br>living there because they will have<br>found this all out before you get there<br>so you can really learn from their<br>experience Dennis oh I see I've got a<br>question who is still going to go of the<br>you busy engine stall so thank you and<br>welcome or gift a token or Bell Ave<br>thank you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
