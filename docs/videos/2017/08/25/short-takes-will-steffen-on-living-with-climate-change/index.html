University, argues that we must develop societies that are in sync with Earth's natural cycles.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>it's very easy to be pessimistic when<br>you see the trends that are going on now<br>emissions still going up<br>certainly co2 concentrations still going<br>up biodiversity still being lost however<br>I think there's some extremely<br>optimistic signs and that is when you<br>look at complex systems and our thing<br>about human societies is complex systems<br>when you approach a tipping point you<br>often see a lot of chaotic behavior in<br>the system as it's getting ready to<br>reorganize whether it's a natural system<br>and ecosystem or whether it's a<br>planetary atmospheric circulation system<br>that's happening by the way in the in<br>the northern hemisphere Jetstream for<br>example it's very chaotic at the moment<br>but it happens in human systems too<br>before we change just in the last two<br>years I see a lot of real sort of<br>excitement a lot of stuff bubbling up in<br>the private sector in a lot of<br>government sectors around the world<br>unfortunately not not quite yet in<br>Australia although underneath at the<br>state level and lower jurisdictions<br>we are approaching a tipping point where<br>people internalize this the climate<br>change and the bigger planetary issue<br>and I think particularly younger people<br>it's going from being sort of an<br>intellectual problem that's so vast and<br>so far in the distance you can't get it<br>your head around it just something that<br>people are starting to internalize<br>conceptually it's starting to feel part<br>of that is because we start to<br>experience it in terms of the biased<br>Earth had to mass bleaching events on<br>the Great Barrier Reef and I think<br>that's actually shook up a lot of<br>Australians who were complacent to say<br>oh this isn't gonna happen or it'll be<br>so far in the distance well in two years<br>you've wiped out 50% of the world's<br>biggest marine ecosystem but they all<br>but people also feel it in terms of<br>bushfire threats I've talked to fire<br>ease for example out in Perth and they<br>said for the first time we're seeing<br>fires that we have to give up and run<br>for our lives<br>they are so intense so threatening that<br>even with the best equipment we can't<br>fight them and so now we've got a new<br>category in our bushfire rating system<br>in Australia which is catastrophic which<br>means get the hell out of there<br>whether you're a resident or firefighter<br>and that's only because we have higher<br>temperatures hotter days drier<br>vegetation the tipping point we need to<br>get over now is for people to realise<br>that there are solutions on the other<br>side that isn't this isn't we've got to<br>give up everything we have and go back<br>to Stone Age or whatever and I think the<br>the biggest positive there is the<br>renewable energy boom because not only<br>is this clean energy its undercutting<br>the incumbents economically as well<br>rather than this being doom and gloom<br>rather than this being impossible this<br>is turning into a challenge an<br>opportunity and a chance for humans to<br>do what we're best at which is to be<br>the thing we have to understand is to<br>get out of this notion that we are<br>somehow going to be massive geo<br>engineers and manage this planet because<br>we don't understand this complex system<br>enough we're disturbing it but we can't<br>manage it top-down and the most<br>important thing that we have to<br>understand is we have to manage us and<br>we have to make sure that by us I mean<br>our societies I don't just mean<br>individuals changing a light globe I<br>mean we have to think of the structure<br>of our societies beyond that we have to<br>think of what's what's most valuable in<br>our societies quickly in the anglo-saxon<br>world we have narrowed down so much of<br>life and tried to stick it in a<br>market-based economic system that we are<br>headed headlong for failure if we don't<br>realize that we have to put limits on<br>what isn't an economic system and what<br>we manage elsewhere outside based on<br>fundamental principles and values so we<br>have to understand that we actually have<br>to manage ourselves in a way that we<br>take pressure off the earth system for<br>example Indigenous Australians their<br>main goal in life was to manage the<br>cycles of life that they came into it<br>and they modified Australia and they<br>built structures and they had fishing<br>systems and they grew grains and so on<br>but they did it within the cycles of the<br>Australian system and when Europeans got<br>there this place was like an incredible<br>garden on the most arid continent on<br>earth so I think that really is our our<br>challenge now is to say how do we<br>develop thriving societies where there's<br>a high level of human wellbeing that are<br>in sync with the cycles of the planet<br>and that's not and that's in a emphasize<br>that's not managing the cycles of the<br>planet it's managing us so that we fit<br>in with the cycles of the planet and<br>when I look around the world and<br>I have the great pleasure of being<br>director of an international global<br>change research program that 50<br>countries on every continent so I got to<br>see a fair spectrum of how countries<br>cultures people are thinking about this<br>and you got the big gorillas out they've<br>got the United States which is hugely<br>important economically and very very a<br>very vibrant scientific community as<br>well and you've got the European Union<br>you've got China but you've also got<br>really innovative small countries I'm<br>thinking here mainly of the Nordic<br>countries I had the pleasure of living<br>in Sweden for six years who are<br>incubators for really innovative ideas<br>and they can do that because they're<br>small they're nimble there's a lot of<br>connectivity across disciplines in<br>science and so on because they are they<br>are small knowledge does not scale with<br>the size of your economy it scales with<br>your education level your social systems<br>and the cleverness of your people so<br>maybe there are opportunities for New<br>Zealand to come up with maybe approaches<br>to carbon neutral aviation fuels for<br>example something we've talked about or<br>certainly we have to have new systems<br>for managing agriculture to reduce the<br>pressure of agriculture not only on the<br>climate but on the water systems and so<br>on agriculture is big in New Zealand but<br>New Zealanders they're innovative<br>maybe some new thinking about how we<br>manage agriculture then could be a huge<br>knowledge export from New Zealand this<br>is a way we need to think I think of<br>becoming a an incubator for innovative</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
