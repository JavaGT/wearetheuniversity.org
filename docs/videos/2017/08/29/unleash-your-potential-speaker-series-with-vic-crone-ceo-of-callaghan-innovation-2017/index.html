and understand we were<br>going in terms of change you know how do<br>you overcome some of the obstacles<br>through that and also how do you create<br>an lead teams that can thrive through<br>change so I'm going to just kind of<br>touch the surface of each of those<br>topics and then leave a really good<br>amount of time for Christians and that's<br>because I believe actually the power is<br>not on me standing here talking at you<br>it's in the conversation that we're<br>going to be able to have and the<br>questions that you have at the end so I<br>really really hope that I stood be like<br>some Christians on the way through and<br>we can have a really good discussion and<br>if I haven't covered stuff then do feel<br>free to ask me and in terms of questions<br>at the end because there's a lot of<br>information that I haven't covered in<br>this I thought I'd just start by talking<br>about me<br>so and a little bit about my backstory<br>so you can kind of understand where I'm<br>coming from for the rest of the<br>presentation tonight so I was born<br>Matthew number three so I was the third<br>child everything was sold so I was<br>completely a mistake and my parents<br>wanted a boy and that's cold they wanted<br>in you know because I was messy number<br>three so they had tried before so I<br>didn't feel alone on that and why do I<br>say that because actually your<br>circumstances shape here and I wasn't<br>going to talk a bit about that<br>throughout tonight and so I was brought<br>up to do everything so we chainsawed<br>chop trees painted fences I mow the<br>lawns which actually I did find the more<br>interesting but rather than the ining in<br>polishing the silver but the point is<br>that I could do it all and so in my mind<br>that task split between men and woman<br>you know male-female just kind of didn't<br>really exist for me growing up and it's<br>been really important in my career<br>particularly being in a more male<br>dominated tikkun innovation industry so<br>that was kind of the the start I guess<br>the other thing that's important about<br>you know how my childhood shapes me<br>we have no claim to fame in our lineage<br>my mum's been doing genealogy for about<br>two decades now got back to about 1400<br>the only claim to fame I have is that<br>I'm like Mick Jagger's Eights cousin<br>like that's it so we don't come from a<br>lot of money we didn't come from a lot<br>of lineage and my parents both grew up<br>in state houses my dad never owned his<br>house<br>my grandparents with my mum they bought<br>their house after coming out of a state<br>house but what my parents taught me was<br>the value of learning and the value of<br>teamwork and again that's something that<br>I've carried right throughout my career<br>and we'll talk about the value of<br>learning as we go through kind of I<br>headed into university because there was<br>no option for me not to go to university<br>coming from the family that I came from<br>and I just I don't really have any idea<br>what to do so my dad was a businessman<br>so I picked that I was like yep let's do<br>business this looks interesting I was<br>also really really good at music but I<br>knew I wasn't good enough to be a you<br>know a world-class classical performance<br>pianist and I knew that I probably<br>wouldn't need much money in there<br>so I chased business um I did my degree<br>BCA I kind of didn't know what to do I<br>did my honours not that well to be fair<br>and then I went under my masters but all<br>through uni I actually worked as well I<br>cleaned houses I waitressed so I had<br>this you know really interesting time of<br>getting some work experience and<br>learning then I finally realised I had<br>enough went into the workforce and<br>landed on Telecom they kind of started<br>the next phase of my career so my dad<br>was my role model so he went in as the<br>postman at his company and he came out<br>as the managing director and so that was<br>my life through Telecom for about 18<br>years was a wind turn as an analyst and<br>I got to the executive with telecoms<br>flooding in terms of when intercourse<br>and then I kind of thought chart the<br>world's changing in this whole thing of<br>being with one company for life that's<br>all gone so there was no way that I<br>wanted to continue that journey so if<br>someone said to me when they when you're<br>offered a seat on the rocket ship<br>you don't actually ask how much you know<br>if you don't dictate the conditions you<br>just go and so I jumped on to 0 and<br>that's a bit about my life I guess is<br>there<br>I've always just jumped done without<br>thinking about it too much it started<br>when I was two I jumped into the deep<br>end of the pool clearly I didn't know<br>how to swim when I was two I just jumped<br>done and and I worked out how to make it<br>work and it was the same with the mural<br>tee and I took it not much about the<br>mural tee tonight but a little bit in<br>terms of why I went for that like if I<br>had thought deeply about this there's no<br>way in hell I would have done there and<br>I've actually got Alain who's here<br>tonight from my campaign team who was<br>just where is she she was amazing<br>throughout the whole thing and so the<br>value of having an incredible support<br>team around you I would never have done<br>it but in hindsight was the most amazing<br>incredible most expense of myself paid<br>personal development course but you know<br>as people would say to me do you feel<br>like you failed and I go general failure<br>would be never trying that and that's<br>how we need to think as a country is<br>it's not about failure it's about not<br>trying so we'll talk about more about<br>that as well so the final thing I just<br>wanted to share about my story is that I<br>remember very early on in my twenties so<br>I'm 44 now and I just tell you that<br>because everyone knows my age from the<br>mortise I'm 44 and so in my early 20s a<br>CEO said to me you know Victoria you'll<br>never have a family and be a CEO I was<br>like oh that's really sad I bet so said<br>why do I have to pick a career and a you<br>know an ambitious and ambition over a<br>family and I was like nah this is not<br>okay I'm going to be really successful<br>and I'm going to have a family so this<br>is my beautiful family so I am now a CEO<br>and I have a family and I'm a woman and<br>it's about actually saying no that's it<br>may have been applicable 20 years ago<br>but I'm gonna chart a path that works<br>for me and for my family about how I'm<br>going to balance you know my ambitions<br>and life in my family in life and I'm<br>really personally quite proud of not of<br>how I've been able to navigate through<br>that and while staying true to my family<br>and family values and my kids so a big<br>big part of what's going to come through<br>in my my talk with you tonight<br>is nothing great as achieved in your<br>comfort zone<br>I have never achieved<br>my best work and my comfort zone the<br>best work that I have ever achieved has<br>been when I've shoved myself out of it<br>literally running jumping and leaping so<br>starting with the pool and telecom I<br>went into the retail sales area running<br>all of retail sales for now spark I've<br>never run a sales channel in my life but<br>that was one of the most successful jobs<br>that I did and we'll talk a little bit<br>about the elements of building teams and<br>how that creates six six years for you<br>for the melty I didn't add in one but I<br>actually got 110,000 votes and I'm<br>really proud of there and I learned so<br>much and it's created a whole new way<br>for me to think about my job my life how<br>I work with my customers it's<br>unbelievable<br>so getting yourself out your comfort<br>zone will come back to there a few times<br>so the first thing I'm going to go<br>through is leading for change and I<br>think the first thing that is really<br>important and leading for change is that<br>you understand it so this is just a bit<br>of a timeline of the major changes that<br>we've been through studying with the<br>Industrial Revolution over the past the<br>1st and 2nd through the 18th century in<br>the 20th century and then of course<br>we've been going through the actually<br>that food one sorry that should say<br>internet revolution so that's very much<br>around how the PC came in and the<br>internet came in and and everything that<br>we've been going through over the last<br>40 to 50 years and we're just starting<br>to inter the industrial internet<br>revolution so that is where meta so<br>that's people and that's animals that's<br>Iroquois<br>it meets the internet and things like<br>seem to senses and so that is going to<br>completely change the world that we're<br>going into so why is this important and<br>why have I raised this because we as<br>individuals are shaped by our<br>experiences and there's people in this<br>room of all different ages which is<br>fabulous<br>I was kind of born in the 70s so that's<br>like you know computers went around I<br>had like the TV in<br>you know the Walkman and stuff<br>but-but-but how I was brought up was<br>completely different on how my children<br>are and completely different on how my<br>parents are and so yeah another big<br>thing that will come through to that<br>today is the value of emotional<br>intelligence so being able to understand<br>someone else's experience is really<br>important and one of the things that<br>frustrated me around the maratti and the<br>housing debate is how we're slugging<br>each other off so the older generation<br>is legging the younger generation off<br>they're having too much epicotyl on<br>toast and the younger generation is<br>legging the older generation off for<br>sitting on assets and I break that down<br>and I say that's just rubbish actually<br>because my parents which is the older<br>generation they grew up and the<br>depression coming off the back of that<br>so they scarcity was huge for them that<br>wasn't grained in them from their<br>childhood and so they see me eating ever<br>cat on toast and they question that and<br>I understand why they question that um<br>and the other way around I look at my<br>parents and many of their friends and<br>they've worked so hard their whole lives<br>to get where they've got and to get<br>their house and it's just flippin luck<br>actually that the housing market has<br>gone up like it is and so I'm really<br>interested in how do we create<br>conversations that bridge the<br>generations not divide them and I think<br>understanding people's experiences and<br>when they've come from is so important<br>to do that you can't judge a<br>seventy-year-old based on your<br>experience as an eighteen year old and<br>like n vice versa the other way around<br>so for me having spoken to groups of all<br>ages from kids through schools right to<br>Probus the most challenging talk I ever<br>gave was to Probus and that was the<br>value of and trying to help them<br>understand what cloud technology was<br>that was I was exhausted and needed<br>about three whines after I came out of<br>it but the great thing was using this<br>model they got through it and they could<br>start to see it so I think for me you<br>know the important thing around this is<br>this shapes our experience and it's<br>really important to understand it why is<br>it important because it's about to like<br>our world is about to change<br>significantly and I'm really part of why<br>I've come to Callaghan is to help<br>educate New Zealanders too that when you<br>look at the latest MYOB report 44% of<br>businesses the biggest tech<br>oh gee that's going to shape their<br>business over the next decade does<br>anyone know what they think it is and<br>you're not allowed our answer Rosalie<br>because you probably know Rosalie set<br>course better broadband connectivity you<br>go right okay so that's kind of where<br>we've been in the last decade<br>things like Big Data drones artificial<br>intelligence machine learning and 4d<br>printing a whole new way of thinking<br>about you know genetic engineering all<br>of that that's what's going to shape the<br>next decade of your business but we've<br>quite frankly as a country got our heads<br>in the sand around that so this is<br>important for me because what we have<br>experienced in you know you look at our<br>you know my mum and dad and what they've<br>experienced and what's going to go<br>through just completely it's going to<br>blow their mind completely for those who<br>are coming out of university you've<br>grown up in the age of the internet<br>mobility and all of that you you you'll<br>be able to navigate this about quicker<br>than the rest of us but this is an<br>exponential shift in what we are going<br>to be able to do and why is that because<br>our computing power is doubling every 12<br>to 18 months so when we think about life<br>forty years out that's about five<br>million time Irish it's not that's 40<br>million times I think the computing<br>power that we have today so who can<br>actually imagine what are we going to be<br>able to do with it so for me a big part<br>of it is trying to educate people as to<br>what the heck does this mean so when you<br>say what I miss there when you say what<br>is life going to look like in 2050 like<br>I actually don't think any of us know<br>like I really don't think anyone knows<br>so let's talk a little bit about what<br>are some of this mean this is a little<br>bit hard to see so let me just share<br>some of it with you so in 2014 cell<br>phones have more processing power than<br>the computers that put the man on the<br>moon so that's you know how far we've<br>come on that at 2021 the iPhone 7<br>technology can fit in a blood cell so<br>that's how quickly we are moving so you<br>think about how we can fit that level of<br>computing power inside inside our bodies<br>and this is what the likes of Orion are<br>working on now is chips that sit inside<br>your body in a everyday<br>every minute of every day sharing the<br>information that is coming out of your<br>body with actually how if you want to<br>share it with and 2026 the ability to<br>put men on Mars 2033 the ability to<br>reverse age I reckon I might just make<br>that and in you know in terms of<br>possibilities who knows we nun terms of<br>actually being able to completely mimic<br>who we are now I'm not going to stand<br>here and talk about all the ethics of<br>all of this what I'm doing is raising<br>this curve with people to say we need to<br>start talking about it you need to start<br>thinking about it in terms that what it<br>means for your life your career and<br>we'll cover some of that we need to<br>start talking about it as businesses in<br>terms of where is this going to take our<br>business because it's guarantee that the<br>businesses that understand this will<br>create global opportunities out of this<br>and the rest of us who don't get it<br>we'll be lucky to survive the next two<br>decades<br>it creates huge huge issues for our<br>ethics and morals so when you're in a<br>driverless car situation and you're<br>facing a deer and a human or you're<br>facing two humans and you're gonna hurt<br>one which one does the car hit and it<br>failed and it provides mess of<br>regulatory challenges for us but we<br>can't even regulate in terms of New<br>Zealand government for existing<br>technologies let alone the curve looking<br>like that and so that's why I'm raising<br>it is not because I have the answers we<br>have the answers is New Zealand as as<br>groups of people here as industries as<br>businesses as people passionate about it<br>so what are the sorts of things that<br>we're going to be able to creative at<br>create out of it and I've just covered<br>just a few of them so for me why did I<br>go into the mural - because it was a<br>bitly field to be fear it's a bit weird<br>is actually because I in Xero I looked<br>at I looked after 190 countries around<br>the world and it was and they weren't<br>the biggest country so UK US and UK had<br>separate country managers I had<br>everything else and it was unbelievable<br>to see on the world stage how cities<br>were investing in the next generation of<br>cities so smart cities and then I looked<br>at Auckland and just go where is it<br>where is the smarts<br>here at that stage India had announced<br>1919 smart cities they're investing<br>about a billion in each city at least<br>they're now up to a hundred smart cities<br>we are completely at risk of being<br>annihilated by developing countries who<br>get this stuff they have passionate for<br>education they have an attitude that the<br>developed world don't have and they have<br>technology in the new world and new<br>business models that they don't need to<br>worry about the old stuff that we have<br>so I look at looked at that and just<br>when we've got to get Auckland on the<br>map on the path towards smart cities and<br>what we can do when we integrate sensors<br>into our water systems sensors into our<br>environment sensors into our traffic we<br>keep building there's these traffic<br>lanes that are completely underutilized<br>if you're in a business that is the<br>worst utilization of your business<br>assets and resources is to have<br>something empty for 95 percent of the<br>day so how do you use sensors to feed<br>real-time information to shift<br>trafficked around in a smart way that's<br>what's happening globally and so I'm<br>passionate about how do we get that<br>happening here another one is autonomous<br>vehicles and when I first done launched<br>the campaign man that I get my head<br>chopped off for talking about driverless<br>vehicles by the end of the campaign I<br>talked to uh 19 15,000 people about it<br>and people started to get it in EM so<br>what's the benefit of that it's the<br>90,000 PS there are 90,000 injuries<br>every year around the planet that are<br>predominantly caused by human behavior<br>so you imagine if we can reduce some of<br>that it's the likes of my parents who<br>are getting you know not yet but five<br>six years away from not being able to<br>drive they can keep the mobility it's<br>the likes of people who don't have sight<br>who suddenly have a range of mobility<br>available these are the conversations we<br>need to be having not looking at<br>driverless vehicles from a technology<br>perspective but how do we apply them<br>into our society and the next one is<br>food to point naught so thinking about<br>the some of the thoughts of thoughts are<br>the things here and last week I went up<br>to Stanford with the Tejano group which<br>is a AG agriculture group for New<br>Zealand and trying to shift our entire<br>industry from high volume to value it<br>2/3 of that the people in there that<br>room have the heads in the sea<br>around what is going to happen to our<br>industry in the next five to ten years<br>so impossible folks who set up<br>impossible foods yeah so let's do a wee<br>little thing who would eat a plant-based<br>burger hands up<br>sadly very progressive audience behavior<br>you could have heard a nail drop in the<br>kind of death with the distrust from the<br>room of the impossible food scientist<br>was unbelievable that is going to come<br>and shake our beef and lamb industry in<br>a way that we in chicken in a way that<br>we just don't we are not understanding<br>it's the same with synthetic milks which<br>all commoners have our dairy industry so<br>it's not whether this stuff will happen<br>it's going to happen and it's whether we<br>have the ability to one be open-minded<br>to see it and to to transition our<br>industries to survive it there is of<br>course the ability to thrive and we can<br>talk of a little bit about that as we go<br>through so that's some of it um the<br>biggest thing for me in all of this is<br>as individuals and as businesses as<br>universities you need to disrupt<br>yourself when you disrupt yourself you<br>have a much better chance at controlling<br>the rules of the game when someone else<br>comes in and does it you don't get too<br>safe in what the rules of that game<br>looks like either as a person or either<br>as a business so this is just what<br>there's plenty plenty of examples of<br>curves and models and terms of how you<br>disrupt yourself and this is just the<br>s-curve basically says you don't even<br>get comfortable when you have mastered a<br>skill they always get yourself into a<br>learning mode and a conscious competence<br>mode and if you are always operating in<br>that mode the return for you either as<br>an individual was you've got six times<br>higher the chance of success and as a<br>business you've got twenty times greater<br>the chance of making more money than<br>everybody else and so that's where you<br>see some of the biggest disrupt excuse<br>me the disruptive players playing and<br>I'll come back to them to a few examples<br>of that so this is a this is a really<br>really big thing I've you know in my<br>business career I've never stayed in a<br>role where I felt comfortable<br>it's always what do I need to do next<br>what do I need to do next what do I need<br>to learn next how do I keep shoving<br>myself out of my comfort zone and to<br>keep going just the other one let me<br>just say it's go back to that just a<br>couple of other things on this one I<br>think it's really important in<br>particularly if you're in business or<br>government or university because<br>governments by the way are not immune to<br>any of the stuff coming<br>we are completely wide open and<br>vulnerable to all of these changes<br>coming it's really important that you do<br>take considered at risk so like you've<br>got to be a little bit careful around<br>what you just go and chase and it is<br>important to be considered in that um<br>and I think the the interesting one for<br>me is zero having spent time in there I<br>was really surprised there about seven<br>years and I think and they will already<br>talk about talking about replac forming<br>their entire business so this is a<br>company that seven years old that is<br>prepared to chuck the entire business<br>platform out the window because they<br>recognize that it was starting to become<br>obsolete so that's the kind of mindset<br>of disruption and disruption and<br>exponential disruption so when we think<br>about okay so what are the skills that<br>you need you know have you know in terms<br>of operating in this new world and<br>there's obviously the foundation skills<br>that you know many of us have and the<br>interesting one that's starting to come<br>through and a lot of the demands for<br>leaders is not just diversity but as a<br>cultural diversity so it's not just<br>gender it's actually it's it's much<br>broader than that and I think you know<br>Auckland has such an incredible<br>opportunity here but the work that's<br>been done by Magian and some of the work<br>that we did at zero just shows we aren't<br>tapping under there at all as a as a<br>city the second one is the competencies<br>in terms of how we approach things so we<br>are shifting big time so as our jobs get<br>automated and around 40 to 45 percent of<br>jobs in New Zealand are at risk of<br>automation over the next 10 to 15 years<br>so personally that rips my heart out to<br>know there for some companies and for<br>some companies half of the workforce are<br>going to go for my company probably 10<br>to 15 maybe 20 percent will go in I feel<br>an immense responsibility to help those<br>people understand actually do you know<br>what your job is looking like it will go<br>I don't know exactly win but let's start<br>to prepare you for transitioning to jobs<br>that won't be around as we go through<br>this change and so what kind of skills<br>do we need we've need critical problem<br>solving because there can be artificial<br>intelligence machine learning that will<br>do a lot of the basic repetitive stuff<br>for us we need to be really creative we<br>need to be exceptionally strong<br>communicators and we need to collaborate<br>the other one that's not in their book<br>that I will talk about is the importance<br>of emotional intelligence and we'll come<br>back to that and then character<br>qualities which is another big part in<br>terms of a number of students often ask<br>me what do you hire for and I say I hire<br>for attitude way over your skills and I<br>hire for diversity so if you've done a<br>wider range of things and then I'm like<br>more likely to hire you so the old<br>traditional models of hiring and are<br>starting to break down so there's a<br>whole range of stuff in there in regards<br>to skill setter that are going to help<br>us get through the next decade or so so<br>I thought and we just talked about some<br>of the obstacles so that's leading for<br>change understand the context understand<br>what you're going I'm talk the language<br>of people who are at different stages in<br>this because we don't have one language<br>and one experience around this society<br>is very broad and get yourself out of<br>your comfort zone over over over and<br>over again so what are some of the<br>obstacles and I love this quote because<br>this is about how I thought in my early<br>20s like all I need to do is just ignore<br>you know like mum said you know you<br>can't have a baby and go back to work<br>and I'm like you know I can I can I can<br>do that you can't have any no I can have<br>a nanny and because you know that was<br>horrific like one she was so excited I<br>was pregnant and having a child she's<br>gonna be green to Grandma um and also I<br>was pregnant out of marriage which was<br>just a really seriously bad and my<br>family and but then the tow the thought<br>of me going back to work from my parents<br>perspective was absolutely not then all<br>I need to do is be ambitious that's<br>natural sit at the table sometimes work<br>hard<br>yep that's natural and it's smooth<br>sailing all the way so what could<br>possibly go wrong and as I've learned<br>through my career a lot goes wrong and<br>the first one actually that's been<br>probably one of my biggest realizations<br>through my career is<br>starts with me actually it's not about<br>blaming everyone else it's about me and<br>as I went through the global woman<br>program which is where I think I met<br>true what I that this quote was put up<br>in front of me and it was actually<br>life-changing and I just fundamentally<br>agree with that I don't think all of our<br>younger generation feel like this but I<br>know a lot of people feel like this so<br>our deepest fear is not that we are<br>inadequate our deepest fear is that we<br>are powerful beyond measure<br>it's our light not our darkness<br>frightens us and we ask ourselves Who am<br>I to be brilliant gorgeous talented and<br>fabulous and actually the questioner<br>should be who are you not to be that and<br>so a lot of the work that I do with my<br>teens is about getting them into this<br>space is about making success wonderful<br>about understanding where their<br>potential their capability is and not<br>just being afraid to go and achieve that<br>and attack that and shine in that but to<br>actually want to go and chase that and<br>make that really important a lot of it<br>is around internal voices that just<br>appear on the on our shoulders and a big<br>one for woman over and over again is we<br>just let confidence so in terms of<br>diversity in your team's how you can<br>bring confidence out particularly in<br>terms of woman in terms of cultures and<br>in terms of LGBT so that that's a big<br>part of what I focused on at my role at<br>zero was an incredibly diverse team and<br>improving the confidence of every member<br>of the team particularly the ones who<br>tend to be less confident the second one<br>is attitude so just on the right-hand<br>side open-mindedness and diversity go<br>together and what I often observe I let<br>me put it another way I fundamentally<br>believe someone once said that great<br>leaders have the ability to hold<br>multiple opposing views in the head for<br>long enough to gather enough information<br>enough inside enough facts enough<br>qualitative information to make the best<br>decision and what I observe happening in<br>society is that we don't do that<br>actually we're shutting down<br>conversations particularly in the<br>political arena<br>we're just firing arrows at each other<br>rather than holding conversations open<br>and saying well you<br>interesting you could be right we've<br>punished our politicians for changing<br>their minds that's a good thing<br>that they actually were open-minded to<br>get new information to say I've got to<br>change so for me that's a really big<br>part of leadership it's being able to<br>understand OTT just have the people<br>around me but be able to hold their<br>views enough so diversity brings that<br>and what's really important with it as<br>emotional intelligence so we'll come<br>back to that the other one that's coming<br>through really really strongly and I'm<br>noticing big time not just in the<br>political space is social<br>entrepreneurism and in social impact of<br>businesses and so things like impossible<br>foods so the scientists and Stanford<br>stood in front of the room of egg tick<br>people no wonder they were pissed off<br>and said I'm gonna eliminate animal meat<br>by 2025 because that's the right thing<br>for the planet because it uses less<br>water less land and you just listed off<br>you know the amount of protein you can<br>get pure anchor out of beef is 20 grams<br>the amount of protein you can get a car<br>out of plant-based food is 200 grams now<br>like hello that's a pretty compelling<br>proposition for the environment and<br>socially so you know we're definitely<br>seeing a big part of this raising which<br>i think is super exciting and I actually<br>believe as our job losses go through<br>that what we'll start to see is people<br>will contract for one two three<br>organizations and do a lot of social<br>based community work as well and I think<br>that's a really exciting model um you<br>know the thing about diversity though is<br>that we ain't embracing it so I've never<br>launched a person into space today she<br>could soar past Mars travel all the way<br>to Pluto Pluto return to Earth ten times<br>before we'll have equality and the<br>boardroom around the c-suite in you know<br>it's just far too flippin long we and<br>that's just for a woman let alone<br>cultural diversity you know<br>accessibility diversity and all other<br>forms so we're not moving on this fast<br>enough I guess is my message here the<br>next one is just the value of lifelong<br>learning so you know that'sthat's what<br>I've really learned I think Trudy you<br>talked about that a little bit with<br>Debbie who's doing the mindfulness yes<br>we were talking about who's Debbie's<br>just come out of corporate and set up<br>her own business with<br>put yourself through education to set<br>herself up for that that's exactly what<br>we need to be doing I think in my<br>lifetime I'll have three to four<br>different careers I was on a path to one<br>cuz that's what my dad did and kind of a<br>you know I've opened my life up and dad<br>wasn't wrong it was just what they<br>that's just what he did I'll have three<br>to four and my kids will probably have<br>seven to eight different careers and<br>what I've learned is that linked in to<br>the confidence that you create a whole<br>lot of skills as you go through and do<br>different things and that skill set is<br>equally applicable as you go through so<br>just having the confidence to know that<br>you can step out and do something quite<br>different and all of the skills that<br>you've accumulated are entirely relevant<br>and useful for that and you're just<br>going to go and check another ten skills<br>and your skill set from this completely<br>different thing that you've got so that<br>whole attitude to lifelong learning is I<br>think one of the biggest things that our<br>country can start to talk about and<br>encourage is how you do that and if you<br>don't have that you won't get through<br>the next 20 years in terms of careers<br>and businesses next one for me is around<br>the tall poppy syndrome and so I think<br>New Zealand has two major obstacles to<br>navigating this next decade and to<br>success on the world stage one is we<br>only be articulate this way so in<br>America someone described if you have a<br>failure in America it's a scar<br>you just got if you have a failure and<br>New Zealand like you're chopped down<br>like that's it and it's really hard to<br>come back from there and that's wrong so<br>our fear of failure we need to turn and<br>- that is the place where you learn the<br>most and your ability that'll take that<br>and learn from it and build something<br>greater is where the magic happens and<br>so this is a good example you just move<br>it before going into the last Rugby<br>World Cup these are the headlines the<br>first - Carter has none of that<br>old all black magic it's like for<br>sake did you see that man on the field<br>and the finals and the second one is you<br>know is Richie McCaw a spent force well<br>I think we all knew that he wasn't um<br>and you know the great thing that I<br>think is you know Richie lost the World<br>Cup he won two straight out of there we<br>lost the America's Cup we<br>came back and away with Finn gents that<br>we just built something that could not<br>be beaten and while the country is going<br>on with 6-1 up and oh my gosh are we<br>gonna make it<br>those boys didn't give a toss they knew<br>they had developed technology teamwork<br>in ways that they couldn't be beaten so<br>for me it's about time we stood up as a<br>country and see if failure is okay<br>learn from it because we've got some<br>incredible examples of let's start with<br>sports people who have done it and gone<br>on to achieve more so I think the hole<br>the hole and there's some interesting<br>thinking going around at the moment<br>around hash tag ROP tool poppy<br>I'm so in for that because we've got to<br>get over there we've got to get a get<br>got to get over our fear of creating<br>great success on the world stage we've<br>got to lift the ambition of our country<br>so I think that's a really major<br>obstacle for us moving forwards through<br>the next decade or so so the last one is<br>creating Loyola winning teams and then<br>I'm going to kind of wrap up and open up<br>to questions so hopefully you've got<br>some and so for me there's basically<br>three things to it so hit the hand on<br>the heart so it's the what are you doing<br>it's the how do you do it and the why<br>you do it and when you put those three<br>things together then you can create some<br>incredible teams I'm obviously having<br>the context of where the world's going<br>and helping people understand why change<br>is important is is super important to<br>success so let's just go a little bit<br>through there the big change and the<br>head which is basically your strategy<br>your goals that's that's basically the<br>heat is that we're shifting business<br>models entirely and for me this is not<br>just an application to business this<br>equally applies to government so what I<br>observe you know in the someone's<br>smiling you that's why I've got you okay<br>good this way so what I observe in the<br>government space is this platform player<br>is equally appropriate so Callaghan is<br>it te indeed ver MPI we need to start<br>working as a platform for innovation for<br>New Zealand rather than individual<br>companies around it has it still doing<br>funny things no good okay I'll just<br>stand over here okay um sorry zero is a<br>great example of a platform play not<br>yeah about here okay zero I'm good with<br>a feed bet you just keep giving it to me<br>zero is a great example of a platformer<br>play and so they've created a whole<br>ecosystem around them why did they do<br>that because it takes work out of it for<br>customers and because it's incredibly<br>sticky<br>you know once you're on that platform it<br>becomes really really hard to leave it<br>and the other big shift that we are<br>seeing and kind of a strategy is the<br>shared assets so exponential thinking is<br>about abundance our thinking of<br>incremental innovation is about how do I<br>do more with what I've got<br>but Airbnb and uber some of the greatest<br>examples of exponential abundant<br>thinking they were not constrained by<br>the resources they had they just said it<br>right we're going to go and get as many<br>homes as we can as many other people's<br>cars as we can and so that's the<br>difference between incremental<br>innovation and exponential and so I'd be<br>really encouraging you to think about<br>how do you take an abundant mindset you<br>don't have to own the resources how do<br>you tap into those resources and a<br>win-win way so there some of the big<br>shifts in regards to the heat part of it<br>the hand is very much what how do you<br>get this done in amazing tools many of<br>the students here would have been<br>exposed to it there's a few exposed to<br>agile Design Thinking lean processes all<br>of their leads to thinking about<br>business in terms of the how you take<br>your stuff to market and that will<br>fundamentally shift it will shift you<br>into the space of customer experience<br>you know user experience all of that<br>stuff so some amazing tools there to use<br>and then the last one actually the<br>second second one around the house for<br>me as emotional intelligence so kind of<br>in my late 20s early 30s I started to<br>realize that I was you know wonderfully<br>ambitious and you know had some good<br>skills and that got me promoted and then<br>suddenly I hit this wall and it was<br>because I started managing teams with<br>layers in it and so my individual<br>functional skill see it was no longer<br>what made the success as a team so<br>emotional intelligence which is the<br>ability to manage your emotions to<br>create relationships it equates to in<br>this study 58%<br>and other studies up to 80% of your<br>success and your job and so being able<br>to tap into emotional intelligence which<br>the great news is when I started my<br>emotional intelligence journey and I got<br> it wasn't flesh wasn't great I<br>wouldn't call that success and you know<br>seven eight years later you know I'd<br>built my skills and I was at the you<br>know heading towards the top of the the<br>emotional intelligence bench max you can<br>learn the you don't have to you<br>know you don't have to be born with it<br>you can learn it and but it is<br>fundamental to unlocking and some of the<br>potential the rest of it of course is<br>about your IQ and about your skill set<br>but the biggest part of what we do is<br>about our emotional intelligence and<br>when you're working with diversity when<br>you're being a more open-minded<br>you need to control your emotions and<br>then the last one is the heart this for<br>me is actually the most important and<br>I've been blessed to work in<br>organizations that are purpose and<br>values lead and people who people want<br>to follow something bigger a bigger<br>cause it's not just about the money<br>and so I chair a social enterprise<br>called figure New Zealand we're about<br>democratizing New Zealand's data that's<br>an incredible purpose and we have over<br>the last year increased our revenue by<br>three hundred percent the year before it<br>was by a thousand percent and we're all<br>where social enterprise so we're all<br>externally funded so people's wanting to<br>buy into the purpose of what we're doing<br>there is another great example which is<br>purpose and values lead so that is the<br>the heart side of it so when you get<br>those three together that's where you<br>create the opportunities to create teams<br>that can lead through change so the last<br>one I just thought I put up is just the<br>Callaghan innovation because I probably<br>should talk about Callaghan somewhere<br>and this is the leadership framework<br>that we fry which is very much around<br>you got to know yourself so that's all<br>around emotional intelligence your<br>strengths your weaknesses all of that<br>you know your journey on that journey<br>and mindfulness and mindfulness is a<br>really important factor and the<br>wonderful thing that we're seeing is<br>that more people are owning up to the<br>importance of mindfulness and all these<br>as we talked about closeted meditators<br>and now suddenly coming out as leaders<br>because it's no longer embarrassing to<br>say that you lead and you meditate<br>because mindfulness is an important part<br>to manage your energy to manage your<br>power to manage change in the world and<br>then it's about showing people the<br>future and the next one for us is about<br>how you take your team on the community<br>for that and the last one is it was<br>actually about delivering so you're<br>delivering what you're promising that's<br>just an example and we're about to roll<br>this out very quickly<br>hopefully my team's seen it actually<br>have you seen it you know there you go<br>they haven't seen it yet transparency<br>right so I think um I just can't kind of<br>kind of leave this up here so in terms<br>of what I think some of the interesting<br>attributes that we need to be charging<br>ahead with over the next decade I very<br>much around curious you gotta be curious<br>like and have courage to Christian the<br>status quo and don't be put off by<br>people who say no you got to keep going<br>I'm commitment to overcome the<br>challenges that is the message there<br>compassion for other people like just<br>chucking grenades at each other between<br>the young and old generation around<br>housing actually won't even not get us<br>anywhere that's it's a rubbish<br>conversation we need to change the<br>conversation and we need to be far more<br>compassionate than that collaboration<br>for win-win purpose and values is<br>incredible place to start to create<br>win-win sustainable partnerships if you<br>start your partnership with a business<br>goal in mind you won't get as far as if<br>you start with a purpose for the next 20<br>years in mind in an agreed kind of<br>similar way values of how you go about<br>achieving that so that's the big shift<br>we've also seen and caliber and<br>community minded so the whole ecosystem<br>approach the ecosystem around innovation<br>New Zealand is way too hard it is too<br>hard for entrepreneurs and innovators to<br>find their way around us so we can talk<br>about that in questions that people want<br>to and then you've got to have the<br>communication skills to motivate so just<br>to kind of finish on a story when I was<br>15 16 I kind of told my music teacher<br>that I wanted to do performance piano he<br>kind of laughed at me because I you know<br>he never played the piano to him and he<br>made me play and I did all that and he<br>said right you're playing at assembly<br>next there next week and I said no no no<br>no I'm not playing at assembly next week<br>and he said you are so next make sure<br>enough I'm turn out with my shop end<br>piece of music<br>in them and he does this introduction we<br>had and I had about 600 kids in the<br>school and he introduces me and<br>literally I'm on the wall over and I'm<br>literally going down like this and I<br>ended up sitting on the floor<br>I hated attention I was incredibly shy I<br>didn't want to speak in front of lots of<br>people I didn't want to perform music<br>and lots of people but here I am<br>20-something years later talking in<br>front of all of you and you know so we<br>can grow we can develop and it's about<br>it's important it's important that I am<br>a good communicator for what I do so I<br>just have to bite my tongue I've just<br>hit to learn how to do it and persevere<br>through it so thank you so much for your<br>time I think we have plenty of time for<br>questions now so my experience is that<br>often it takes woman a little bit longer<br>to raise their hand up so my challenge<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
