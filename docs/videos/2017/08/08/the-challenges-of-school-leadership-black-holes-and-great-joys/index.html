feedback back<br>from internationally recognized experts<br>in his field of<br>expertise now these referees um<br>highlighted the caliber of Ross's work<br>including his research record his<br>mentorship of graduate students and his<br>collaboration with local National and<br>international research<br>groups but these referees also<br>highlighted the impact of Ross's work on<br>professional practice in particular they<br>highlighted the importance of his work<br>for the recruitment selection training<br>and assessment of school<br>leaders these referees were also very<br>clear that Professor notman is one of<br>the best known scholars in his field for<br>educational Administration um in New<br>Zealand so Professor Ro notman on behalf<br>of the University of atago I would like<br>to congratulate you on your very<br>well-earned promotion to professor and I<br>will now call on Professor Tony<br>Ballentine who is the proce chancellor<br>of humanities to tell us just a little<br>bit more about your journey to<br>ten tenot Cur as proce chanc of<br>humanities is my great pleasure to<br>introduce Professor Ross notman uh Ross<br>is a professor at the College of<br>Education and since April uh this year<br>he has also been the college's Dean Ross<br>has very strong Roots he was born in<br>denan and spent many of his formative<br>years in north otago and also on the<br>tyre and I think his knowledge of and<br>attachment to rural communities has been<br>a formative influence on his academic<br>work uh Ross is a a very proud otago<br>graduate originally with an honors<br>degree in French uh after training as a<br>teacher he had a full and richly<br>textured uh career in schools around an<br>Eden teaching everything from classics<br>to physical education I'm not sure if he<br>combine those two subjects in the same<br>class but a full range of activity um<br>turning to his current role Ross is not<br>only uh dean of the College of Education<br>but he also serves as the Director of<br>the center for educational leadership<br>and<br>administration he has worked very<br>extensively in school leadership on<br>principal appraisal and on principal<br>support groups he was the foundation<br>head of Department educational studies<br>and professional practice at the newly<br>merged University of otago College of<br>Education for 20072 2008 in 2009 he was<br>a visiting fellow to the teacher and<br>Leadership Center at the University of<br>Nottingham and this is just one example<br>of his very strong International uh<br>connections uh he has been awarded a 4B<br>travel scholarship that was in 2011<br>which he took up in Indiana and Alaska<br>to study and compare Innovative<br>leadership programs for rural principles<br>in 2014 Ross had a period of sabatical<br>leave as visiting academic at the<br>University of Edinburgh also at<br>Nottingham and Oxford prior PRI prior to<br>taking up the role of<br>NZ visiting scholar he was also<br>appointed as a visiting research fellow<br>at the Asia Pacific Center for<br>educational leadership and policy in<br>2015 so these are just a few of the<br>distinctions that really show the full<br>intern scope of Ross's activity Ross's<br>major research interest focus on the<br>teacher and School principal development<br>particularly in the field of personal<br>dimensions of leadership he is a New<br>Zealand Project Director of an<br>international research study across 25<br>countries and to the leadership<br>practices of successful School<br>principles and a 12 country study of<br>leadership and high needs schools Ross<br>has recently completed a joint research<br>project on teacher leadership ship with<br>the University of Edinburgh he has also<br>been the director of a New Zealand<br>government funded uh tlri research<br>project which has examined values<br>teaching and learning in the New Zealand<br>School<br>curriculum he is incredibly active<br>professionally he's heavily involved in<br>editorial work he has given many<br>Keynotes and addresses at International<br>Gatherings and he has published<br>extensively on a whole range of<br>educational leadership issues um so it<br>is really great that we're here both in<br>person and also online to be gathered to<br>celebrate Ross's promotion and to hear<br>his Reflections this evening which are<br>titled the challenges of school<br>leadership black holes and great Joys so<br>Ross<br>K thank you Tony for that introduction<br>words those opening lines of my Mii<br>share with you my strong rural<br>background beginning as Tony kindly said<br>with the backstory in Kura north of<br>tago marvelous place to grow up in and<br>where you learn a lot about being part<br>of a<br>community you're also aware that the<br>were the OD person who did great Deeds<br>coming from that place as well uh and I<br>think of uh Arnold<br>nordmeer uh who uh formulated the New<br>Zealand social welfare<br>system and of course I can see the<br>sporting mind working there one Richard<br>mcco who happened to play some Rugby<br>school my topic this evening as Tony has<br>said looks at the challenges of school<br>leadership black holes and great jewries<br>the topic will interweave past and<br>present leadership and learning and<br>research experiences<br>and also some future thinking at the<br>end have you ever wondered like I have<br>from time to time where some of these<br>topics ever come<br>from you look at professorial lectures<br>you sometimes look at conference address<br>topics and it seems to be quite clear<br>until you get to the<br>colon where we have the challenges of<br>school leadership and then it breaks out<br>to something sort of esoteric and quite<br>personal and vaguely complicated it's<br>not really in my case but it does have<br>some personal images in the back of my<br>mind when I put this<br>together the black hole simply<br>represents particular challenges<br>obstacles that confront School leaders<br>today but in the back of my mind it also<br>has a vivid word picture and picture<br>image for when I was a student here at<br>this University doing my honors degree<br>in French one of our number insisted on<br>wearing an orange T-shirt very brightly<br>colored with the words inscribed on the<br>front black holes are far<br>out it's always struck me and never left<br>me<br>clearly uh as Tony kindly backgrounded I<br>have a diverse range of teaching<br>experience uh I started off with a<br>degree in French and English but as<br>sometimes happens in teaching I ended up<br>teaching PE Classics and<br>Latin and in case you're wondering Tony<br>it is very easy to go from one to the<br>other I recall teaching a fifth form<br>Latin class dressed in a tracksuit to go<br>in period four to go and teach for Zed<br>in Period 5 the anacronismo my students<br>I can assure<br>you I'd also want to say too um to my<br>university colleagues that as you can<br>see in that picture there that uh<br>University students at at too do not<br>have a mortgage on toga parties it does<br>stretch to motivating students I'm quite<br>lucky in a way I think when I look back<br>and that<br>my promotional pathway didn't go through<br>the normal way of uh curriculum and<br>being a head of department but rather it<br>went through pastoral care as a year 11<br>and a year 12 Dean at tar high school<br>when I began my<br>career uh some might say well you're<br>still a dean and you haven't gone very<br>far at all I also enjoyed working and as<br>leading learning with advice and<br>guidance programs I think we were one of<br>the first schools in 1977 to put<br>together an advice and guidance program<br>for year one and two<br>teachers uh I was a third-year teacher<br>when the boss asked me if I would put<br>together a program for a group of eight<br>new uh year one students arri teachers<br>sorry arriving in our school um it's a<br>source of great amusement and local<br>knowledge out on the T that at the end<br>of that first year supervising the year<br>one teachers I got engaged to one of<br>them um which created some consternation<br>espe amongst the women on the staff who<br>didn't know we were in fact going out<br>together so that was a great joy and uh<br>is I also went on to get involved in<br>other sorts of leadership with with<br>adults both were School parents of the<br>students I was working with who used to<br>tell me lots of different things that<br>were happening at home uh including<br>their children not coming home on time<br>and indeed not coming home at all<br>my other past uh reveals something about<br>my sporting background and I must<br>confess to being a sports fanatic and my<br>Rugby career got curtailed in this<br>University with concussion for the third<br>year in a row so I took up rugby referee<br>and uh really enjoyed that to provincial<br>level through the<br>1980s I share this slide with you<br>because it was quite a special moment<br>and my refereeing career and Allied to<br>my current employer and that I was asked<br>to referee the Centennial game for the<br>University of atago Rugby Football Club<br>playing the what was in atago 15<br>masquerading as<br>assassinx I don't know if any of you<br>here have anything to do with the school<br>of physical education but if you look<br>quite carefully at right in the middle<br>row kneeling just in front of Mike<br>Brewer with the colored sash neck<br>uniform on there's a rather thin down<br>version of Professor Ken<br>Hodge uh had a beard in those days<br>I'm still waiting to be thanked by Ken<br>because I allowed him in that game to<br>run 25 M unimpeded for a try and he<br>thanks the leadership then took a turn<br>into the spiritual element in terms of<br>my leadership experiences when Julie and<br>I had two years leave to go and teach in<br>OE I ended up in a school called the<br>Catholic uh gunnersbury Catholic boy<br>School in brenford in London my<br>employment status was rather diverse as<br>you can see rugby coach tennis coach<br>teacher of English and<br>fored and I got to teach math when the<br>Australian math teacher left to make<br>more money as a brick<br>player the black hole however did appear<br>in terms of being asked by the<br>Headmaster to be an upper six form<br>tutor it turned out and I didn't realize<br>that this was a rather Plum job that the<br>Oxbridge boys of the staff were eagerly<br>anticipating Oxbridge meaning those who<br>were educated at Oxford and<br>Cambridge to have a kiwi get the job was<br>just a bit below the belt there was<br>consternation amongst the staff and I<br>had the odd comment like you're our<br>antip ofan friend and do you wear a<br>grass skirt in your<br>country when I went to the Headmaster<br>whose name was unsurprisingly<br>Mick I said to him what's the story<br>you've appointed me to this Plum job<br>when the troops back in the staff room<br>are pretty anxious about it and his<br>reply was well you can see that uh<br>already they are a very refined group of<br>young men and and that was true um one<br>of them had his wrote his own plays and<br>had them performed in Pub<br>theaters uh three were doing religious<br>education to a level so they were on the<br>way to Rome if you<br>like so uh he said yes they are a very<br>frying group I said why me and the<br>response was with a wicked grin on his<br>face I thought you might give them some<br>rough<br>edges my research Journey began after i'<br>finished my term as assistant and Deputy<br>principal at Bayfield and moved to the<br>denen college in<br>1990 with my Master's study which looked<br>at how Boards of trustees and primary<br>schools were appointing their new<br>teaching principles a pretty exact<br>exacting task and you can read in the<br>Board of Trustees newsletter of one of<br>the schools I observed and worked with<br>in<br>1994 that they were looking to share<br>their principal qualities with the<br>school Community we emphasize it's not<br>an exhaustive list the task has been<br>compared with trying to design God so<br>there's plenty of scope which I thought<br>was marvelously broad thinking of<br>them what I did find was that yes they<br>did have good selection processes and<br>systems but there was still very much a<br>place for The Human Side in terms of for<br>example best fit how will this person<br>fit our<br>community I'd have to say also for some<br>of the trustees it was will this person<br>be a threat to us<br>in addition there was also a certain gut<br>feeling that they kept referring to that<br>were outside the strict criteria of uh<br>what they felt about people uh in this<br>in this regard as a as a complete aside<br>if any of you are thinking and weighing<br>up the merits of whether to put a<br>photograph in a job application uh i'<br>suggest be careful on one of my Board of<br>Trustees selection processes one of the<br>candidates furnished a magnificent I<br>thought photo of himself and his wife<br>and two children underneath a blossom<br>tree this particular School we're<br>looking for families and and all the<br>rest of it for two other trustees he was<br>always going to be having a quite a task<br>why look at him he's got a beard we're<br>school I was very lucky in terms of my<br>leadership experience to be part of a<br>joint University ofar the needen College<br>of Education twinning program and<br>contract with the Malaysian Ministry of<br>1993 the aim of the contract was to<br>bring out to New Zealand EO young<br>students aged 18 groups of teachers with<br>5 years teaching experience to be<br>trained in esol and college lecturers to<br>be supported in a professional<br>development program for adult teaching<br>uh I worked alongside as the college<br>coordinator Professor Ellis Fox from<br>English and Professor Keith Bellard from<br>education uh quite a dynamic duo for<br>someone to work with who was still uh<br>about to start their own<br>PhD when I said to Lester Taylor why<br>have you asked me to be the college<br>coordinator to work with these two<br>professors as part of this program I<br>know nothing about English language<br>acquisition and his response was well<br>you teach French don't you isn't that<br>close<br>enough I'd have to say it was a<br>marvelous experience and a very very<br>steep learning curve for me which I<br>thoroughly<br>enjoyed that's a photograph there of<br>some of the original College lecturers<br>from Malaysia and some of the denen<br>college staff some of whom you might<br>recognize derivation of the great Joys<br>part of the title for this lecture where<br>does the that come from well of course<br>it's the opportunities it's the positive<br>things that happen for school leaders<br>but where does it certain in my memory<br>in terms of a of a colorful<br>image when Alistar and Keith and I went<br>to Malaysia to start the contract<br>negotiations we got taken out on the<br>second night to a very August dinner<br>hosted by the Malaysian<br>authorities I got to sit beside uh a<br>very important<br>man who said to me<br>um have a look at the menu and I would<br>suggest Ross that you try the first soup<br>that's there and it's called fish lip<br>soup and great<br>wonders um I found the fish lips but I<br>have no idea where the great wonders are<br>yet I couldn't really complain because<br>the man turned out to be Sal and D uh a<br>former uh AO dental school graduate who<br>also fortunately for us was the then<br>minister of Education for<br>Malaysia at the end of the dinner he<br>said and how were the were the fish lips<br>and the soup and I was a bit dumbfounded<br>and all I could think of was simply a<br>wonderful my research Journey continued<br>into my PhD when I joined the University<br>of atago at the end of<br>1999 to set up the itaga university<br>Bachelor of teaching secondary program<br>a little bit about the<br>PHD it's based around values based<br>leadership I followed two secondary<br>principles for three<br>years interviewing them considerably<br>plus significant others and including<br>their<br>spouses observations of them at work<br>within their school at different<br>meetings within the school home group<br>meetings and also Regional principal<br>just to see how it was that their<br>personal and professional values<br>impacted on the way that they LED their<br>schools one of the key findings of<br>particular interest I'd like to share<br>with you is that in those moments when<br>principles have awful major decisions to<br>make they're invariably for example when<br>a student will they stay at school or<br>will they be um put aside suspended or<br>moved<br>on what was interesting was that both<br>principles before they got to that<br>dilemma management and decision stage<br>always referred back to significant<br>others around them the deputy principal<br>their Board of Trustees<br>chairperson about the value stance that<br>sat in behind the decision not the<br>actual decision itself but did they have<br>it right in terms of what they all<br>agreed with was the value stance behind<br>it and often it was individual interest<br>versus the common<br>good and both principles said to me that<br>why they did that was they they felt<br>they needed to feel fortified by the<br>values that set him behind so they could<br>deal with the parents and the students<br>in particular in the board meeting that<br>followed and it made them feel so that<br>there were other people sitting on their<br>shoulder that they were making the right<br>like as a result of that<br>research I developed a model for<br>principal uh<br>self-awareness uh which is now being<br>used by a number number of leadership<br>facilitators in New Zealand and some of<br>my colleagues in the United States as<br>part of their principal preparation<br>programs just to share with you what<br>occasions sometimes when I've gone<br>through this exercise with principles<br>they tell me it's one of the hardest<br>things they've ever had to do to stop<br>and think about themselves and take time<br>and give permission to themselves to<br>reflect on themselves and the job<br>the first stage we look at is what I've<br>called values interrogation it sounds a<br>bit like the Gusto with Arch lights but<br>it's really it's not it's just<br>encouraging our principles and our<br>leaders to think about themselves and<br>what indeed are their personal and<br>for we then move to look at values<br>alignment where those values that They<br>hold personal and<br>professional align with their staff and<br>the community that they live in<br>as you could imagine the flip side of<br>that is a third stage where we look at<br>where their values are contested or<br>where there is conflict of values with<br>staff with some parents with wider<br>Community I'll share an example with you<br>some number of years ago working through<br>this model with a group of principles on<br>a Saturday one principal was stretched<br>out on the floor of the room that we<br>were in and said to me you have no idea<br>how useful this exercise is for<br>me nothing further was said until the<br>end of the year when I ran into him and<br>he said um I just want to share with you<br>I've<br>resigned and why have you resigned he<br>said you remember that exercise I did<br>with you lying on the floor I said yeah<br>he said I then realized the cause of the<br>difficulty I was having with some of my<br>staff and my parents and my school<br>community that were just simply not on<br>the same wavelength in terms of what we<br>believe in should be happening about<br>education in our area so rather than<br>prolong the difficulty for myself and<br>for them I resigned I'm now teaching my<br>curriculum area another school and I'm<br>perfectly happy and I think they are<br>too the last part of the model is an<br>optional one where I invite principles<br>and Senior leaders if they want to form<br>up a values Le philosophy about<br>elves I returned when we merged to the<br>college in 2007 as an hod and as Tony<br>said director of the center for<br>educational leadership and<br>administration just want to share with<br>you very briefly uh some of the<br>international collaborative topics that<br>I've been involved with along with other<br>uh case study investigators around New<br>Zealand this is a really interesting one<br>called the international successful<br>school principalship project<br>ispp there's quite a number of countries<br>involved and looking at how principles<br>across different contexts can be<br>successful and how they maintain that<br>success over time and I should mention<br>that the features there that I'll<br>mention briefly that have asterisks<br>beside them are the ones where the<br>principles believe uh across the board<br>that that makes a difference in<br>sustaining success over<br>time so I've grouped them under three PS<br>if it was rugby it would be Pace<br>possession and power but it's not so we<br>have pedagogical leadership first of all<br>whereby the principles Focus very very<br>keenly on teaching and learning as they<br>should professional leadership includes<br>those features there having a vision and<br>direction that you can share with your<br>staff and your<br>community clearly an emphasis on quality<br>teaching and professional<br>development Distributing leadership<br>which means encouraging your staff to<br>take up different responsibilities<br>according to their strengths and<br>expertise there is a difficulty with<br>that of course that it makes a big<br>assumption doesn't it that the teachers<br>will have the wish and the capability<br>and the time to take up those<br>responsibilities and that clearly works<br>well in very large schools but if you're<br>a two or three teacher primary school<br>there's not too many other teachers you<br>can distribute leadership too and<br>contextually responsive leadership is a<br>real theme coming through how much uh it<br>is really important to be able to uh<br>understand the context of your community<br>the context of your educational agencies<br>and the political and social context in<br>which we live and work personal<br>leadership is the third feature<br>interpersonal you would understand would<br>go through most organizations it's the<br>inpersonal which is my particular area<br>of<br>Interest again featuring strong<br>educational values sense of moral<br>purpose sense of resilience against the<br>obstacles that we encounter our<br>integrity and the last one was pretty<br>crucial that was came up first of all<br>with all our uh sample principles the<br>ability to self-reflect both the thinks<br>of what sort of things did they think<br>about they thought about the<br>preparedness of teachers to teach the<br>willingness of students and preparedness<br>to learn and they also thought about<br>their own performance uh in terms of<br>leadership in some of the decisions that<br>they'<br>made this resulted uh the study which we<br>began in 2008 resulted in an edited book<br>in<br>2011 uh of case studies across New<br>Zealand I also added much to the<br>surprise of the international director a<br>case study about ear Early Childhood<br>Center in the north Ireland which was a<br>mai immersion Early Childhood Center<br>because I wanted to give recognition uh<br>to The Marvelous work or the leadership<br>work that is happening in that sector as<br>sector second topic of uh International<br>research involved High needs not high<br>needs of students but High needs in<br>terms of schools the environment they<br>find themselves in so for example in the<br>local region here in the Deep South uh<br>we did some pilot studies looking to see<br>what uh were some of the factors that<br>caused the school to go into a high need<br>situation not unsurprisingly there were<br>features like social disadvantage a high<br>proportion of children with behavioral<br>and mental issues low levels of literacy<br>and numeracy and one should never forget<br>the challenges face by our rural schools<br>in terms of geogy graic<br>isolation in fact in one year one of our<br>primary schools reported up Central that<br>30% of this school population left at<br>the end of the ski season which kind of<br>makes it rather difficult to staff and<br>get continuity of<br>programs but what I wanted to share with<br>you just very briefly was that high<br>need is generally long-term situations<br>but it can also be episodic in terms of<br>uh personal tragedies or in the case of<br>two Christ schools post earthquake that<br>I work with uh episodic in terms of a<br>natural<br>disaster the aim of this project is to<br>look at high needs ramifications and how<br>we might better prepare principles in<br>terms of their preparation for<br>that so in Christ Church I work with two<br>schools a primary and secondary post<br>earthquake to see what sort of things<br>were going on there in terms of their<br>resiliency what's ort of things keept<br>them going a focus on their students<br>learning determination that that would<br>proceed as normal especially with the<br>secondary school with ncea exams coming<br>up when they felt valued by colleagues<br>and parents they work with positive<br>people interestingly they got a lot of<br>resilient uh uh Force if you like from<br>watching the children cope positively<br>with the situation probably better in<br>some cases than the adults<br>especially the younger ones who while<br>there were things happening at home were<br>still eager to run around push each<br>other in the mud and yell and scream and<br>have a good time and eat their lunch<br>funny the things that stick in people's<br>minds that keep them going there are<br>also examples<br>of Staff courage of situations that<br>happened with uh with different staff<br>members I had two informal conversations<br>interestingly with two caretakers of the<br>respective schools<br>the secondary school caretaker told me<br>that uh and the staff told me that they<br>really admired him he was one of the<br>only one who was left to clear the first<br>floor of the school a school block while<br>they were evacuating outside he said he<br>was tossed from one side of the<br>classroom to another repeatedly and<br>wondered if his time was going to be up<br>I got a similar story from the caretaker<br>of the primary school who said he'd been<br>clearing students out to go and have a<br>roll call out on the grounds and their<br>teachers along with the principal as the<br>school buildings were creaking as the<br>spouting was breaking apart and he said<br>I just said to the principal what the<br>hell are you doing here you need to be<br>out there with your children and your<br>teachers you're no good in here he said<br>the principal wouldn't shift until I<br>told him to get lost in appropriate<br>colorful terms and I just said to him if<br>somebody needs to go it needs to be me<br>not<br>you how courageous and inspir ational is<br>that I'd also like to share that quite a<br>number of uh the interviewees that I<br>interviewed in the senior leadership<br>teams mentioned they ate an awful lot of<br>resilient my last research project has<br>been really marvelous they say sometimes<br>you should never work in the<br>entertainment world with animals and<br>children but children are great<br>especially<br>preschoolers uh American colleague of<br>mine have been working jointly looking<br>at successful leadership in a high needs<br>Early Childhood setting here in denen<br>we've done some pilot studies of three<br>Early Childhood<br>centers one of the key findings there<br>and you should never estimate young<br>children as that young fellow's t-shirt<br>there<br>says and a teacher pointed this out very<br>vividly that when in a high need setting<br>parents are is related if they don't<br>have much money if they don't have a job<br>if they don't have<br>transport then the Early Childhood<br>teacher and the head teacher become one<br>of the major adults in their lives<br>certainly Monday to<br>Friday and so the teachers were very<br>aware that they were meeting parenting<br>needs and personal needs and financial<br>advice for parents as much as they were<br>the educative needs of their<br>children working with Pres school was<br>experience there was humor in doing<br>research by the way and there's a real H<br>special occasion to work with young<br>people I'll give you an example by one<br>young man that was running outside who<br>was staring at a window and there was a<br>raindrop coming down the window pane and<br>he turned around and said to<br>me how come that raindrops small<br>I'm an education researcher I'm not a<br>scientist what do I say to this kid<br>there's no good point talking about<br>precipitation and<br>condensation so I said well I'm going to<br>tell you a story that's a madeup one and<br>it's not true but it's the best<br>explanation I can come up with he said<br>like that said well here it goes there's<br>holes in the sky where the rain gets in<br>but they're ever so small that's why<br>rain is<br>thin and he gave me a look that really<br>wasn't<br>convincing but I thought to myself thank<br>Radio I'd like now to talk briefly about<br>future challenges and opportunities that<br>there is in my particular field of<br>education and school leadership what are<br>some of the challenges but also what are<br>some of the<br>opportunities I think for too long we've<br>concentrated on traditional eurocentric<br>views of educational leadership and<br>Concepts what about now looking at<br>indigenous concepts of leadership and<br>how that might inform the way we think<br>about leadership in<br>schools my colleagues in the Asia<br>Pacific tell me that they're Awakening<br>to this idea especially my Chinese<br>colleagues who now talk about the hidden<br>literatures that sitting behind their<br>reading and their culture that might<br>assist their understanding of how they<br>lead in their particular cultural<br>setting I discovered relatively recently<br>that in the late 1800s in this country<br>two Mali Chiefs described<br>characteristics independently of tribal<br>leaders as to how they should manage<br>their<br>operations and also their moral and<br>ethical obligations to maintain the<br>well-being of their tribe they call that<br>pum Manoa the eight talents are I<br>haven't listed them all there but there<br>are three that I have put up which I see<br>as having parallels with my field of<br>organizational and educational<br>leadership and you can probably see the<br>Parallels for yourself there in terms of<br>Human<br>Relationships having the knowledge of<br>tradition and culture which equates to<br>organizational culture in schools as<br>ethnicity bravery and courage to uphold<br>the rights of hapu and e sits nicely<br>with my field in terms of advocacy for<br>social justice for every child in our<br>school I've had discussions with ha<br>holes my colleague and local<br>kataa about these Concepts and how they<br>impact and he often talks about also the<br>concept of way he or respect even for<br>people that you don't particularly<br>like he tells me that the mai language<br>has no word for enemy but the closest he<br>can get is a loose translation called<br>wild<br>friends I've used that term with rather<br>unhappy and nervous School principles<br>before an education Review Office<br>visit that they shouldn't regard the<br>people coming in as the enemy at all but<br>just being perhaps occasionally widely<br>friendly but also deserving of our<br>respect<br>working for social justice in schools<br>there was still plenty of work to be<br>done there and lots of opportunities to<br>what one can call scholarly activism<br>both through our research and through<br>our practice there's a nice quote there<br>in an edited book that was coming out<br>with my colleagues shortly uh Michelle<br>Morrison and Rachel McNay from W<br>University they had the social justice<br>part of our isln project while I was<br>looking after the high needs<br>and I think it rather says it rather<br>nicely the Relentless P pursuit of<br>social justice outcomes required in<br>addition to strategic and managerial<br>skills a willingness to speak out<br>educate and Advocate both within the<br>school and Beyond such a commitment<br>demanded of these School leaders<br>considerable resolve courage resilience<br>self-sacrifice lots of issues there and<br>I guess we can think of numerous ones uh<br>one that came through was of a principle<br>having $1,000 to spend and the two<br>choices that the principal had was to<br>give it to a gifted and talented program<br>that the parents were of those children<br>were very keen on or did the principal<br>spend it on English language acquisition<br>and teaching for a group of refugees uh<br>who just come in to the<br>area often the lemas are between not<br>necessarily between right and wrong<br>right Challenge and opportunity three as<br>you'll all be aware in the room we do<br>have uh a succession planning problem<br>and challenge in New Zealand schools uh<br>a lot of our uh senior teachers and<br>principes uh within 10 years of retiring<br>age and so what are we doing to create<br>the confidence in schills with our<br>younger teachers is coming<br>through I like in Scotland where the<br>looking at teacher leadership uh very<br>closely giving support to teacher<br>leaders and giving them credit towards a<br>master's degree from all their<br>professional development work that they<br>do it's something I'd like to see us<br>look at here in New<br>Zealand I'd also like to see us extend<br>the the entry pipeline for our<br>leadership framework in New Zealand<br>traditionally we've had at the other end<br>experien principles we've had um new<br>principles and we've had aspiring<br>principles but there's a huge gap in the<br>pipeline leading up to that which at our<br>Center uh we are trying to fill at the<br>moment in terms of giving support to<br>Middle leaders giving support to teacher<br>leaders through courses that we're<br>running but I'd like to take it one<br>stage further back again and think about<br>what can we be doing with our student<br>teachers primary secondary Early<br>Childhood in our initial teacher<br>education Institution in their colleges<br>of Education to encourage them to think<br>about where they would be going and<br>believe me they are thinking about it<br>I've run probably three sessions now<br>over three years with our secondary<br>people at our College of Education in<br>particular and each year it's one of the<br>most dynamic sessions that I run tons of<br>questions about<br>leadership at the end of my most recent<br>one I got an email from one young man<br>that said thanks for the session Ross<br>enjoyed that I know I haven't been in a<br>classroom yet and it's a bit<br>presumptuous on me but I've got one<br>question how do I become a<br>principal that's Gen Y so we have to go<br>with<br>it and finally which is a thread through<br>my session with you tonight the human<br>dimensions of<br>leadership who is the person behind the<br>principle how do people find their<br>success in terms of their<br>authenticity and often the the phrase<br>you'll hear is I know where I<br>stand uh she's the sort of person where<br>uh I can get in behind because I know<br>what they stand for and where they're<br>going we do have opportunities to build<br>on existing structures in New Zealand<br>our school leadership framework does<br>have concepts of makaki Tanga leading<br>with moral purpose and a concept called<br>doing in the middle of my own doctoral<br>study thinking back my supervisor asked<br>me a key question halfway<br>through I want you to write down in the<br>single sentence what you think the nub<br>of the problem is in your<br>thesis fantastic thing to do and I've<br>since used it with every person I<br>supervised as some of you in the room<br>will<br>know and my answer was how do we nurture<br>the the human Spirit of the school<br>principal as one of them said in the<br>face of the emotional and embrac of the<br>face that's not contained to education<br>only and sports people amongst you<br>especially rowers will know of a<br>well-known New Zealand coach called Dick<br>Tonks who apparently I'm told has a<br>dilapidated office in a shed beside Lake<br>kapiro but in amongst all his rowing<br>gear there is a very inspirational old<br>coffee cap full of pens but on the<br>outside of the coffee cap is inscribe<br>cried rowing is simply about the human<br>Spirit it does make you think about the<br>it I'd like to start to draw my lecture<br>with you<br>tonight with a word of appreciation I<br>can't thank everybody that's been part<br>of my journey but there are some I'd<br>like to make mention of first of all to<br>Julie and my two children<br>uh I've really appreciated your support<br>and patience especially when I've been<br>doing uh Masters and doctorates and the<br>doctorate um while holding down a<br>full-time job I really do appreciate<br>that you only find out sometimes too<br>what your family's put up with after<br>it's all<br>over to the students that I've had over<br>the years and still continue to have for<br>their constant questioning things like<br>why do we have to do it that<br>way which I find invigorating and it<br>makes me reflect about my own practice<br>and my own thinking and<br>research student inquiring minds too as<br>I've shared with you about the young man<br>with the Raindrop in the Early Childhood<br>Center the highest Accolade I should say<br>with the Early Childhood Center wasn't<br>that incident but on my last day having<br>lunch with a group of young men just<br>before 12:00<br>and one of them said to me just before I<br>left are you going are you coming back<br>no I've finished I'm I'm going home and<br>I'm having my lunch and I'll leave you<br>to it with an Earnest look on his face<br>the young four-year-old looked up at me<br>and he said would you like to come to my<br>birthday party<br>want there' be many leadership role<br>models that I've had in my professional<br>life and I'm sorry I can't acknowledge<br>them all but I would like i' to make<br>mention of two one Emeritus Professor<br>Keith Bellard who not only uh came in<br>partway to supervise my PhD but taught<br>me to have utter respect for the<br>research<br>process I'd also like to acknowledge<br>Lester Taylor former principal of the<br>the needen College of Education not only<br>for sending me to<br>Malaysia but also helping me to<br>understand uh the real effect in of a<br>high trust model of educational<br>leadership and finally to those many<br>teachers and leaders that I have worked<br>and still working with who show<br>remarkable resilience absolutely<br>inspirational in the face of the<br>challenges they face their ability to<br>bounce back from<br>adversity and to make a difference for<br>young people's<br>learning and I include in that group<br>also the staff at denen and inago<br>campuses of of the University of atago<br>College of Education you people are<br>quite<br>amazing in<br>conclusion leadership is not only about<br>doing it's also about<br>being it's about understanding what it<br>means to lead and also what it means to<br>be<br>human it's also about confronting the<br>challenges and thinking about the opport<br>unities the positivity that can come out<br>of wrestling with those challenges and<br>the advantages both for staff and<br>students that can arise from it in this<br>regard I'd like to conclude by finishing<br>up with a four-line refrain from one of<br>Leonard Cohen's songs called Anthem<br>which seems appropriate in light of what<br>I've just<br>said ring the bells that still can ring<br>forget your perfect offering<br>there is a crack in<br>in Teno Teno Teno<br>for those of you who don't know me I'm<br>Professor Lisa Smith from the University<br>of atago College of Education thank you<br>so much Professor notman for this<br>enlightening and entertaining talk I'm<br>truly honored that you asked me to<br>provide the commentary for your lecture<br>tonight for your inaugural professorial<br>lecture tonight tonight

Zealand and in<br>England I have a copy of Ross's<br>PowerPoint slides so Ross fair warning<br>don't be surprised if that Claudius<br>picture shows up someday somehow<br>someway but seriously your research on<br>selection of School principles and<br>values based leadership has not only<br>guided you but has also pointed the way<br>for effective leadership practices in<br>New Zealand and Beyond I can speak<br>personally to how much your work with<br>the original twinning program with<br>Malaysia helped to lay the foundation<br>for the very successful program the<br>college recently shared with Batu<br>lintang you've also presented for future<br>challenges that are certain to expand<br>not only your research but our knowledge<br>base so Professor notman on behalf of<br>our vice Chancellor Professor harleen<br>Hayne our Deputy Vice chancellors<br>professors Helen Nicholson and Richard<br>Blakey and Deputy Vice Chancellor<br>Professor Vernon Squire who sends his<br>apologies
