font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I started my literature review when I<br>was 4 years old I was given the book The<br>Little Engine That Could and I was<br>fascinated by the story for those of you<br>that don't know it's about the smallest<br>engine in the yard given the job of<br>taking the toys over the hill to the<br>children waiting on the other side<br>as he goes up the hill it gets harder<br>and harder and harder and he says to<br>himself I think I can I think I can I<br>think I can and of course eventually<br>makes it to the children and delivers<br>the<br>toys so how does this relate to my<br>PhD well it started a lifelong<br>fascination with self-efficacy or<br>confidence I've always been interested<br>in this idea of self-belief and its<br>power so when I had to choose a PhD<br>topic I was teaching accounting at the<br>time to First Years I thought I want to<br>investigate the role of self-efficacy<br>within accounting<br>education now I'm going to tell you<br>something at this point that might shock<br>you not all students want to learn<br>Accounting in fact accounting as a<br>discipline is often seen as a little bit<br>dull who knew and yet all<br>students learning about business need to<br>know at least a little bit of accounting<br>before they<br>graduate some students want to be there<br>they're excited it's interesting other<br>students well they see it as dull boring<br>and hard but they all have to be there<br>it's not<br>optional so what I've done is I've<br>surveyed thousands of students across<br>multiple semesters at two different<br>universities all enrolled in a firste<br>accounting course I've asked them about<br>their level of selfefficacy with<br>different aspects of the course such as<br>how confident are you with asking asking<br>for help from your lectures for studying<br>for the exam organizing your notes what<br>about how confident are you to pass the<br>exam and what I've found is that their<br>level of self-efficacy to do with the<br>academic success is actually the most<br>powerful predictor of whether they do<br>succeed in the course over and above all<br>of the other variables that I gather<br>data on including whether they're done<br>accounting at high school or not meaning<br>that self-efficacy is more powerful than<br>prior learning in this context which is<br>really cool for me because it means I've<br>taken this wellestablished Theory<br>brought it in and shown that it holds in<br>an accounting education space but<br>excitingly it also has a practical<br>contribution for Learning and teaching<br>accounting because it doesn't matter if<br>you think it is dull boring or hard what<br>really matters at the end of the day is<br>can</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
