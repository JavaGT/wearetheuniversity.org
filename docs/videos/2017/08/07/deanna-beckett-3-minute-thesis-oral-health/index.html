font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>dental diseases are the most prevalent<br>chronic diseases worldwide with an<br>estimated 2.4 billion people globally<br>suffering from untreated dental decay<br>alone but what does that actually mean<br>take a look at the image of this young<br>woman she has dental decay that has<br>spread to the nerve and blood supply of<br>her tooth the tooth has died and become<br>infected the infection is spread through<br>drained out of the root of the tooth and<br>is pooling into the side of her mouth<br>that is why your face is swollen at the<br>top you can see untreated dental decay<br>it doesn't look good it doesn't smell<br>good and it's often painful if your<br>teeth or mouth look like this it is not<br>easy to eat sleep or concentrate people<br>make judgments and this impacts on the<br>way that you're treated now in New<br>Zealand if you have a sore throat or the<br>sniffles you can go and see your GP and<br>your treatment is subsidised but if you<br>have teeth like this and you're over the<br>age of 18 there is no government funding<br>and that means that unless you have the<br>money to pay for private intil care<br>there is nothing you can do about it and<br>that is not okay so how do government's<br>decide how to split the health dollar if<br>you had to decide between treating one<br>person with cancer or 20 people with<br>tonsils getting me France without what<br>would you do<br>to make this process as fair and<br>transparent as possible many governments<br>are relying on economic evaluation one<br>method is using a quality of life<br>questionnaire with an algorithm that can<br>calculate a quality adjusted life year<br>or quali<br>a quality is a unit of benefit<br>measurement that considers not just the<br>cost of treatment but the length of your<br>life and the quality of your life is<br>what these guys need to help them make<br>really big decisions there are currently<br>no oral health related quality of life<br>questionnaires<br>with their algorithm that can calculate<br>a quali and that puts us on the back<br>foot when trying to make a case for<br>funding my research is looking at how we<br>can get that quali I conducted dental<br>examinations for 87 people and gave each<br>of them to quality of life question is<br>to complete one with oral health<br>specific and the other was generic I<br>wanted to know whether or not the<br>general health measure with the<br>algorithm was reading the same as the<br>oral health measure and whether or not<br>it was sensitive to actual oral health<br>status because if so we have something<br>tangible that shows government oral<br>health is important people are suffering<br>they need and receive treatment and at<br>the least that should be subsidized</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
