font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Wittig is is a family-owned New Zealand<br>company founded in 1896 by James Henry<br>Whitaker in Christchurch the business<br>subsequently moved to two Wennington and<br>the factory was situated just off Vivian<br>Street and then in 1969 the business<br>moved out to tapara and that's where<br>it's the position of the company today<br>still a small company in terms of the<br>the overall market and we're up against<br>some formidable competitors in Cadbury<br>thing that really sort of not only sort<br>of helps us defend our share but grow<br>our share in markets is the quality of<br>our chocolates and were absolutely<br>rigorous about that we are the only<br>major chocolate company in New Zealand<br>that imports the cocoa beans and does<br>the roasting refining the whole<br>manufacturing process through to the end<br>product Andrew and brandy that the<br>current owners of the of the business<br>invest heavily in the factory the<br>quality of the machinery that we have<br>the refining machinery molding machinery<br>the packaging machinery is all world<br>class we use Ghanaian cocoa beans which<br>amongst the best in the world and also<br>the inclusions that we have in in our<br>products over the years and room Brian<br>have built up the knowledge of where to<br>source the best hazelnuts best almonds<br>best peanuts and we are very selective<br>in the people that we choose for the<br>company and we invest heavily in the<br>social media now is is very important<br>part of our communications television is<br>still important but the whole digital<br>area is it's very important successful<br>brands build a community around them<br>because people like to be in communities<br>and successful brands act as a as a<br>magnet and build communities around them<br>and social media is very very strong in<br>helping to build those communities we<br>have over 700,000 followers on Facebook<br>now and that is a community focused on<br>on Whitaker's and it's fabulous because<br>we can tell them about products that are<br>coming out about things that are<br>happening within the company and people<br>involved in digital media love new news<br>and they love telling in other people<br>about it and that's why it has become<br>such a powerful communication tool for<br>the company we still use television a<br>lot and I think the good thing about<br>television it certainly helps drive the<br>emotional values of the brand and<br>obviously we've had very successful<br>campaigns using Nigella Lawson which is<br>and we can see how that has has driven<br>particularly the creamy milk product<br>creamy milk product and you know to<br>become the number one chocolate selling<br>SKU in the country now it's a<br>combination and each has a role within<br>the overall communications of other<br>company<br>voted New Zealand's most trusted brand<br>for last six years and most loved brand<br>for the last five years we haven't got<br>the 2017 results yet but we are hopeful<br>it comes back to having a very clear<br>vision you know the world eating<br>world-class chocolate from poor era and<br>staying true to that vision and one of<br>our products has a the barium biscuit<br>has a biscuit in it biscuit piece in it<br>and you know we had to go to<br>extraordinary lengths to get a biscuit<br>peace without palm oil in it and we have<br>to import that from the UK believe it or<br>not and that costs you know that that<br>does cost but it goes back to that the<br>belief of a company you know world-class<br>chocolate we don't believe world-class<br>chocolates should have have pollen and<br>and you know we have made a position on<br>that and we are consistent about it<br>intuition is very important to us we<br>don't do consumer research we obviously<br>by retail data but we don't do consumer<br>research we rely very much on the<br>intuition and the talent of our people<br>and I'm not saying research is wrong but<br>I think a lot of companies tend to sort<br>of hide behind research we don't and I<br>think if you have the right people the<br>talent working on the business use your<br>intuition because nobody should know<br>your business better than you because in<br>in the end consumers really don't know<br>generally don't know what they want you<br>know and they will play back history<br>because that's that that's their<br>reference in the end you know you have<br>to take the responsibility if you're<br>driving a company through innovation and<br>the chocolate market is very much driven<br>through you know innovation<br>although the chocolate market you know<br>chopped has been around for a long time<br>there is still good growth in the market<br>and that's driven by innovation and you<br>get innovation through the the intuition<br>and talent of your people that's what we<br>believe<br>and you know that that's that the way</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
