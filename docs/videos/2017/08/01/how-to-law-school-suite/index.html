Here are some helpful tips for students entering into Part I Law at the Auckland Law School.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so I'm just walking down to the law<br>school mouth which is in the heart of<br>the legal precinct right behind me here<br>is the High Court pretty exciting so the<br>things to think about when approaching<br>the University of Auckland law degree is<br>not only to think about a potential<br>legal future for you or potentially what<br>a challenge this degree might be to<br>undertake think about all of the great<br>transferrable skills that you'll acquire<br>which almost too many to list so if the<br>going gets tough and you're feeling a<br>little bit overwhelmed don't worry we've<br>all been there what's most important is<br>just remember why you're here<br>the first year of uni and especially<br>your first semester is always going to<br>be a little bit tough at times I<br>personally like to take some time away<br>from all of my studies and all of the<br>intense necessities of what's going on<br>academically and just take a walk or go<br>through the city sit in a park or<br>something like that because there's so<br>much greenery around and it can really<br>help to refresh you in the middle of<br>this hustling bustling CBD<br>don't hesitate to take advantage of<br>couple more things to remember about<br>your law degree and officially part one<br>is that you shouldn't compare yourself<br>to what everyone else seems to be doing<br>don't worry about what grows other<br>people are giving and to focus on how<br>you yourself can do well yes that's<br>going to seem like there are 10,000<br>cases and you're going to be a little<br>bit daunted by the whole thing let's<br>just remember it is daunting but it's<br>doable and you will pull through just<br>keep your focus and remember why you're<br>here<br>this is general library pretty hard to<br>miss that's just across from the quad<br>and off some Street as a parlor until<br>you've expending all your time here for<br>your lectures and doing some studies so<br>this is the quad I've come here a few<br>times if the chill would make that it's<br>just a custom the general library and a<br>really good spectral point if you're<br>trying to never get your way around<br>campus it's also got a lot of different<br>food places you can come to if you want<br>to find some lunch this is the law<br>students common room and part one you<br>probably won't come here but definitely<br>part two and onwards it's a good place<br>to chill get some food and study where<br>to find me we have redux feeling most at<br>home in part one it's the lecture<br>theatre and that's all the magic happens<br>I'm not actually meant to be in here as<br>a part one student but next year so this<br>will be where your part one tutorials<br>are here is where we kind of lose new<br>topics we go things we go there were<br>talked about in the lectures and and<br>just addressing different ideas and<br>different things that happen in the<br>medium with legal system I just love<br>this room taking them Majesty creative<br>unique or less got costume plays<br>listening Samoan so there's so many cool<br>little places around campus that you<br>definitely check out while you're here<br>you need to go exploring to find all the<br>cool little pockets around the unique<br>and exploring you'll be able to find<br>your way around a lot easier<br>hey guys how's it going great so can't<br>find a vacuum cleaner though yeah<br>obviously one of the most important<br>parts about university is actually<br>hitting the books especially if you're<br>looking to get into part 2 law and<br>succeed in part 1 so here are some study<br>tips that I've accumulated over the<br>first semester in hopes that they might<br>help you to some top tips from take if<br>you will as follows do your readings<br>before class that way you know what the<br>lecturer is talking about and it's not<br>just a bunch of ketchup information you<br>can actually start to synthesize ideas<br>which a lecturers like that<br>take notes don't be a passive passenger<br>start just be like oh I'm here so I'm<br>learning okay not how it works my friend<br>sorry if the lecturer if there's<br>something interesting write it down it<br>will probably help you with an<br>assignment mixed up find good methods<br>that work for you not just cool methods<br>like what you've seen on Instagram like<br>if a certain type of study plan looks<br>aesthetically pleasing but doesn't work<br>for you don't use it for most of your<br>time if you study smart you may not need<br>to study hard go somewhere you won't be<br>distracted learn that the hard way big<br>most of the semester in my bedroom turns<br>out I just end up on Facebook maybe go<br>to a study room or a library with a<br>friends who can hold you accountable or<br>hold each other accountable so you don't<br>inevitably end up taking each other and<br>leaning on Facebook trishul why are you<br>tagging me in means you've got an exam<br>tomorrow<br>budgeting is an everyone's favorite<br>topic that when you're a student it's<br>really important to try keep on top of<br>your spending thankfully at the<br>university there's plenty of places that<br>say your cheat meals just to get you by<br>with a little bit of extra money in your<br>pocket at the end of the week I live in<br>uni Hall which is the first year fully<br>catered for so don't seem to get out too<br>much for lunch but if so classes that<br>run over lunchtime and I want another<br>option there's always the vegan lunch<br>every Wednesday this smells really good<br>the food's cheap its healthy it's<br>delicious what else because you want to<br>do on a Wednesday afternoon so now we're<br>just going to head over to get one of<br>those budgie meals just something that's<br>a little bit cheaper if you like me and<br>on a student budget and can't afford a<br>whole lot let's go ahead a look this is<br>just one of the student heck's for just<br>China spend as little money as possible<br>in course books because trust me it's<br>worth all your money ends up going at<br>the beginning of the year my key tip to<br>usually something would fall out of this<br>bin not today trying to get the<br>toothpaste all the way up to the top<br>because you've got to make sure you use<br>it every last bit of what you've got but<br>unfortunately when you're a student you<br>might be able to afford the toothpaste<br>but not the toothbrush<br>so the transition from high school to<br>uni can be a bit daunting because<br>oftentimes you won't know anybody going<br>from intermediate school to high school<br>you may have already had a<br>pre-established group of friends but<br>coming to uni can be a very different<br>story especially with the course like<br>part one law it can be pretty daunting<br>when it's competitive and not knowing<br>anyone can make things a bit more scary<br>than they need to be but making friends<br>at uni is super easy and keeping that<br>support system with part one law is<br>really important<br>joining clubs is a really great way of<br>making friends here at all commuting the<br>first-year law students and part one<br>loss is the a ul SS and debating<br>societies which both really helpful ways<br>which I can't one students how to get<br>into part two other options include<br>things like spheres the music the meat<br>club is anything the ever dream of in a<br>classical music so we try going into<br>lectures just take a seat next to<br>someone and make conversation<br>when you're studying you tend to spend a<br>lot of time just sitting down so let's<br>go the German just burn off some energy<br>I'm just climbing my water success<br>because I want to take care of my<br>personal house just like you should if<br>you're going to do a law degree strong<br>body strong mind how do I get down so<br>it's really important if you're not<br>feeling too hot the stress of the law<br>degree which I know from personal<br>experience can be quite demanding<br>I hate that there is a university house<br>in two on campus that you can go to a<br>few meeting things from counseling or to<br>see a doctor so if you're in a hurry and<br>on the go and you need a quick snack or<br>an exam sex too much you might as a<br>place to use this is where I'd come to<br>hand in and pick up assignments or tests<br>or if I need advice I can come and talk<br>to student advisors like jimana so<br>here's your tip if you have any<br>questions about lob part-1 or getting<br>into lob patches we're here to help<br>thanks Jemima<br>it wasn't scripted at all there's more<br>to your well-being just kidding<br>physically said you also have to take<br>time out of your day and your week just<br>to be by yourself and have some u-turn<br>so just to remember keep active make use<br>of the services at uni like the health<br>center and remember to take some time<br>out for yourself<br>you</p></main><footer
