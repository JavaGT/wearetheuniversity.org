I'm working the Center for<br>International Health and it's a great<br>privilege to have Fulton Shannon here<br>from Liberia Fulton was trained in with<br>the Bachelors of Science and he has two<br>masters qualifications he did his<br>master's degree in Ghana at the<br>University of Ghana and I've seen his<br>thesis which was a case-control study of<br>the risk factors for acquiring Ebola<br>disease in health care workers and it<br>had some very interesting results<br>suggesting that there was critical<br>components of health care that were<br>lacking in the facilities after a<br>patient said before and after patients<br>were admitted he's now coordinator of<br>the strategic information analytics<br>group in the Ministry of Health Liberia<br>which is slightly different from how I<br>advertised it in the flyer because we<br>were in a ration I couldn't remember all<br>those words at once so I just like to to<br>welcome fulton it's a it's a fantastic<br>privilege for us to have someone from<br>liberia from a wonderful country of<br>Liberia and who's experienced so many<br>different challenges that many of us<br>will never have to face in in your life<br>and it's going to tell us about one of<br>them and give you a person to give you a<br>feeling for the country of Liberia as<br>well as the Ebola situation and and<br>what's what we look forward to in the<br>future so please say welcome<br>laughter thank you very much<br>froth hell well I think the introduction<br>was quite in detail and just to repeat<br>what I was said I'm photon Shannon I<br>work with the Ministry of Health in my<br>area so at the strategic information<br>analytics initiative is one of our new<br>projects that enable us to bring<br>together all of our subsystems on our<br>overarching health information system at<br>the Ministry of Health so I is fairly<br>new we have barely started some of the<br>detail workings but we actually will get<br>there as we go along<br>so Liberia is a very small country<br>probably may go into New Zealand maybe<br>once or twice and we cover a land space<br>of about 600 kilometers long and 200<br>kilometres why we have a population of<br>4.5 million and this is actually a<br>projected population based on our growth<br>rate of 2.1 the last time we had a<br>sensors in Liberia was in 2008 so we're<br>supposed to do that every 10 years<br>so next year we're not preparing for<br>another sensors a next year image is the<br>official language in Liberia and we have<br>16 indigenous groups or tribes or<br>different languages in Liberia that in<br>addition to English<br>I spoken unfortunately I cannot speak<br>any of them though the largest city in<br>Liberia is Monrovia and Monrovia is our<br>capital city so we divided into 15 sub<br>political divisions we refer to us like<br>our counties and within those counties<br>we have the Health Ministry for<br>oversight and supervision divided those<br>sub counties into 90 health districts so<br>this is a map of Liberia and we bordered<br>on the west by Sierra Leone just for the<br>sake of information there's some natural<br>disaster happening now in saloon and we<br>hope that we can all keep them in our<br>prayers in the love by gaining the east<br>by the Ivory Coast and we have a lot to<br>take ocean just by the soft so I taught<br>to just give you a feel of the Liberian<br>storages so we understand where this<br>country has how this country has evolved<br>over the years so we actually was<br>founded in nineteen M in 1847 by a group<br>of free slaves from the United States<br>under the banner American Colonization<br>Society and we gained independence but<br>you won't agree with that but we<br>actually gained independence in 1847 and<br>the first major political Tamil<br>experience in Liberia was in 1980 when<br>there was a military coup d'etat and<br>this was actually based on the fact that<br>the indigenous people thought the<br>so-called miracle Liberians were<br>enjoying everything that the country had<br>in what is the best schools best<br>healthcare and they were lagging behind<br>so they thought the best way in their<br>mind at the time was to take power by<br>force so the top power in 1980 on the<br>12th of April and the rule up until 1989<br>within that that group of people there<br>was some another form of disagreement in<br>terms of even though the indigenous were<br>ruling but again a segment of them did<br>not feel to be part of they enjoying it<br>so Chad Silla led a revolution in 1989<br>and that civil war went over to 1997<br>there was an election he won the<br>election landslide but just after two<br>years there was another outbreak of a<br>civil war which ran until 2003 when<br>Taylor left Liberia in August and then<br>in October on the 11th 2005 we elected<br>the first female president in Africa<br>ever and did that also in 2011 so her<br>term actually ends this year we have an<br>election in October and<br>we can relate a better leader and then<br>came they Ebola outbreak in March of<br>2014 so this is a slide view of the city<br>Monrovia and this is West Point if some<br>of us has been following the outbreak<br>development West Point is actually the<br>largest slum community in Monrovia and<br>doing outbreak this entire community had<br>to be quarantined because there was some<br>huge spread of EVD among the population<br>we also have some very beautiful beaches<br>the picture right here is the Lee basa<br>eco lodge that we usually go for<br>relaxation and tourists I invited to<br>come over this one shows the locals do<br>some celebration on a beach we have some<br>wildlife in Liberia the chips are<br>available we have natural reef with this<br>and this is the highest form of the<br>highest land form in Liberia the Nimba<br>mountain<br>very well known to concession companies<br>that work with - and order Liberia play<br>host to the Firestone rubber plantation<br>one of the largest rubber plantations in<br>the world over 100,000 acres and they<br>made your source of feeding with a lot<br>of our families is true subsistence<br>farming and our step of with rice so you<br>see here in this picture they being<br>they're planting rice also in the next<br>one they have a still after some time<br>and then they sad pictures of the civil<br>war in Liberia and the Ebola outbreak so<br>as we all may know Ebola is a zoonotic<br>disease though largely the natural<br>reservoir of this virus is unknown but<br>MOCA bats specifically fruit bats<br>I mean implicated as a reservoir and a<br>host over the period of time that had<br>been spilled over events of Ebola<br>transmission from animals to humans and<br>subsequently between humans to humans<br>it's very fatal with case fatality rate<br>of between 45 to 90 percent and was<br>first detected in 1976 in southern Sudan<br>and northern the air which is now called<br>in an acute second stance they an onset<br>of signs and symptoms is between eight<br>to ten days but generally it stretches<br>between two to 21 days and some of the<br>common signs and symptoms include fever<br>muscle pain and after five days the<br>science of gastrointestinal symptoms<br>headaches conjunctivitis and studies has<br>shown in about 18 percent of those<br>infected with Ebola<br>we have hemorrhagic symptoms now in a<br>country like Liberia where malaria<br>typhoid and other diseases are endemic<br>detecting Ebola is is kind of difficult<br>because some of the signs and symptoms<br>early signs and symptoms that manifest<br>in a an infected patient resembles that<br>of malaria for example which may most<br>likely lead to differential diagnosis in<br>so when infected the virus tends to<br>present itself in the our body fluids<br>and escrita in in someone who's infected<br>and there are opportunities for human<br>transmission through direct contact with<br>a person who sick or person who has died<br>from Ebola indirect in contact with<br>cooking utensils eating utensils medical<br>waste like used needles and other<br>medical equipment that may have been<br>used on an infected person there are<br>some limited the ace limited information<br>on domestic animals like dogs and cats<br>being hosts or being susceptible to<br>Ebola infection we there's still some<br>studies on going to to understand<br>whether that is actually true a person<br>is only infectious if he or she starts<br>to show symptoms so if within the<br>incubation period 2 to 21 days someone<br>may be infected but may not be able to<br>transmit because they at that point in<br>time and not showing signs and symptoms<br>until that on said you are not<br>contagious and there has been some<br>studies to understand whether one can<br>get infected with true inhalation of<br>aerosols<br>but that hasn't really been established<br>or took now don't outbreak there were<br>three main metals used to diagnose Ebola<br>in Liberia the PCR real time which<br>requires a collection of about four ml o<br>blood from a suspected patient and over<br>swap of a post motivatin and there was<br>also the Eliza that we also collected<br>whole blood but this time in a different<br>medium where because you require to use<br>the serum for testing and then there was<br>the rapid diagnostic test<br>our aditi that was also used in the<br>field now when it's sample is collected<br>by the SOP states that within 24 hours<br>72 hours max because if you look at the<br>topography of Liberia and the challenges<br>were bad rules and inaccessible<br>communities we thought to step down up<br>to 72 hours so that we gave some<br>leverage in time for transport to for<br>transportation of these samples for<br>testing and once the specimen reaches<br>the point of test is between 8 to 24<br>hours to have the lab results after<br>testing<br>so when a case is detected or a case is<br>suspected<br>it requires that they help work out we<br>get that case collect example as<br>described in the previous slide and that<br>person in a hot spot community at that<br>point in time because we wanted to<br>actually manage transmission we set up<br>what we called at the time community<br>care centers those were usually<br>makeshift centers other in a room a<br>makeshift room in a health facility or<br>school depending on which infrastructure<br>was available at that point in time that<br>we could use quickly so that person gets<br>moved to a CCC if is a hot spot<br>community or the person will get<br>actually transported to an Ebola<br>treatment unit which we term as etu the<br>primary mode of transport was the use of<br>ambulances but there are cases where<br>ambulance at a point in time may not be<br>available some other vehicles were used<br>known cure for Ebola so a case of Ebola<br>will actually go through some supportive<br>care IV fluid resuscitation electrolyte<br>replication oxygenation those are the<br>clinical management that I personally<br>would like to go into because I'm not a<br>clinician but these are just some of the<br>few therapy that we use to manage Ebola<br>patients during the outbreak so within<br>the<br>we also established what we call a<br>probable and suspected war so you<br>wouldn't just come to an ETU<br>and get moved to where confirmed cases<br>where so because after some time even if<br>your tests come positive we run it for<br>another time to make sure that you<br>actually a true positive before you get<br>moved to the actual treatment unit or<br>treatment war within a etu so what this<br>is a picture showing a patient who's<br>bedridden being taken into an ETU<br>the elwa to one of the most famous ET<br>used during the outbreak this is a<br>little picture of it and in one of our<br>counties bombing this is a picture of<br>one of our community care centers and<br>you see these people here there were all<br>suspected cases of EVD and their<br>pictures are in there so the the Ebola<br>outbreak in West Africa was actually the<br>largest ever since the 1970s when it was<br>firstly detected statistics show that<br>over 28,000 there were twenty eight<br>thousand infections and 11,000 deaths<br>spread across 10 countries and three<br>continents and only 8th of August in<br>2014 with every issue declared the<br>outbreak public health emergency of<br>international concern so this map<br>actually shows a history of Ebola the<br>ones in red showed two sporadic<br>outbreaks that occurred before 2014 in<br>the congo gabon<br>of the Sudan Uganda and then the one on<br>they right at the left actually shows<br>they are breaking Liberia as of the<br>fourth of August about nine of the our<br>tech team up in 15 counties already<br>reported cases of Ebola by August that<br>time and this is actually a map of<br>gaining saloon in Liberia but this map<br>shows the epicenter of the outbreak<br>where the origin of the average where<br>the outbreak originated actually in a<br>place called giggidy in Guinea and they<br>our index case went for a failure in<br>Giga do because in like Liberia Sierra<br>Leone and gaining especially within this<br>region they speak a common language or<br>common digital language of kisi so here<br>was this person came for funeral and in<br>Africa we have our own different<br>practices funeral rites when a person<br>dies so that individual actually a<br>female got infected here and got in a<br>public transport and drove all the way<br>down here to Monrovia and along the way<br>there were some transmission occurring<br>so basically we had one big wave of the<br>outbreak in Liberia and two smaller<br>clusters between 2040<br>to 2016 the larger one was in March<br>which was the first one after almost a<br>year actually a year from March 2014 on<br>the 9th of May 2015 there we should<br>declare like variable I free but then<br>there were still we had something we<br>call heightened surveillance so we were<br>still on the alert because there were<br>still transmissions and gaining and<br>certain so because our borders about 80<br>percent of our borders are porous<br>there's no control or movement and<br>people walk in at any point in time so<br>there was heightened surveillance so on<br>it was around the 29th of June I<br>actually come back to do one of my<br>outputs from Ghana I was in school I<br>actually come back to do one of my<br>outputs surveillance system data<br>analysis when this outbreak was reported<br>and I was actually one of those<br>investigating this one in June the small<br>cluster of six cases which occurred in a<br>smaller County called Maggie V and then<br>little spill or having three cases in<br>monserrate oh there was a third one in<br>November which we have like three cases<br>that actually occurred in a community<br>called the foot road<br>manraja Monserrat oh so on the overall<br>we had over 10,000 600 cases or vvd in<br>Liberia about 3000 160 of those were<br>confirmed and we had over 4,800 deaths<br>including suspected there's probable and<br>confirmed and the overall case fatality<br>rate for the outbreak in Liberia was<br>so this graph actually shows the<br>national picture of confirmed cases of<br>EVDO<br>with the big way the first one the one<br>that happened in 2014 and it shows that<br>by the time we were in August there was<br>this sharp increase in the number of<br>confirmed cases which peaked in October<br>and then started to drop down until me<br>the next year this one shows the number<br>of suspected cases that were reported<br>over time from the 15th of April 2015 up<br>until the fifth of me that seen here and<br>the red dots here show that of all of<br>these suspected cases of<br>EVD that were being reported because we<br>obviously broaden the case definition<br>for a suspected case because we were in<br>an outbreak situation so obviously we<br>have most suspected case has been<br>reported but they were all being tested<br>negative hence the red dots you see at<br>the bottom of the graph<br>so this is actually a flow of our<br>routine surveillance information in<br>Liberia so the health system is broken<br>down into different levels we have the<br>community level where we have our<br>community health workers or community<br>health assistance that have been trained<br>in what we call triggers community<br>triggers related to the 14 conditions<br>that are under active surveillance in<br>Liberia so they then we put if the<br>diagnose or not diagnose but if they<br>identify or suspect any case or an event<br>they report that to the health<br>facilities which is the next and formal<br>level now a health facility has two<br>individuals at least two persons<br>responsible for surveillance so at the<br>health facility there are clinical<br>standard case definitions for those<br>conditions and they will verify whatever<br>alert that they get from the community<br>and if that alert meets the case<br>definition for the condition for which<br>has been reported<br>that information goes to the district so<br>at the district level we have district<br>surveillance officers who are charged<br>also with the responsibility to verify<br>whatever information coming from the<br>community and subsequently report to the<br>county at the county again this county<br>surveillance officer and then the<br>Ministry help where we have the division<br>of disease prevention control and which<br>where the Debbi issue<br>so during the outbreak we thought to<br>actually mimic what what is here with<br>our routine information but just this<br>time around we were dealing with<br>different data sources so we had a lab<br>that was responsible to give us lab<br>results we have the CCC's which I<br>explained about earlier the community<br>care centers that were reporting<br>suspected cases suspected and probable<br>cases of EVD at a point in time then we<br>had the dead body management team DVM<br>for short<br>they were responsible to give us<br>accounts on suspected deaths they were<br>responsible to give us information on<br>how many persons died because they were<br>taking dead bodies from communities also<br>taking dead bodies from health<br>facilities ETU CCC's so they were giving<br>us on a daily basis information on how<br>many bodies they were collecting from<br>the different sources and then there was<br>the ETU giving us information on how<br>many cases they receive how many cases<br>survivors they just discharged over a<br>period of time how many persons are<br>still in KN treatment and all those<br>information King other in an Excel line<br>list form or a tabular form in in<br>Microsoft Word and then that information<br>was manually tribe you later to come up<br>with an aggregate daily situation report<br>which recorded le separate and also put<br>into the district health information<br>system - which is the DSS to our overall<br>data management for health information<br>system in Liberia<br>at the county level they were also<br>collecting similar information but for<br>their own operations and delay objects<br>they were developing their own real<br>estate reps and having their own<br>coordination meetings for operations on<br>the other side the County people were<br>doing case investigations so there was a<br>case investigation phone and a contact<br>reason list there was a form also for<br>contact reason and these functions were<br>given to the counties so they will<br>actually tabulate them and there was a<br>version for this is two at the County<br>Health Team people were trained on the<br>use of das - and those information were<br>manually entered into the overall this<br>is - for aggregate data analysis so<br>because there was an influx of partners<br>different NGOs individuals everybody<br>wanted to do something and I during the<br>onset everything was just in this array<br>we did not know where to start we did<br>not know where to place resources we<br>didn't know how to solicit resources so<br>then the idea of establishing an<br>incident management system IMS came<br>around so this diagram shows the<br>coordination structure for the response<br>at a point in time so on the top there<br>was the presidential Advisory Committee<br>on Ebola that was set up purposely by<br>the president Liberia for the sole<br>purpose of giving hall a day-to-day<br>report what a progress were the<br>challenges where the needs it did a<br>report on everything that happens with<br>the Ebola response efforts in<br>three and then there was IMS which was<br>headed by the assistant minister for<br>preventive care in Liberia at the<br>Ministry of Health and then there were<br>made three major pillows on a Imus<br>there's our medical and planning medical<br>and planning had five major thematic<br>areas that's how we term it and there<br>was lab there was episode valence which<br>I was a part of at some point before I<br>left for school there was social<br>mobilization contact trees in case<br>management and honor case management we<br>had the psychosocial committee and the<br>divided management committee so for<br>support<br>we had another pillow for I am a support<br>which actually covers logistics<br>operations finite and procurement<br>monitoring evaluation and planning and<br>then there was the operation part where<br>the counties were given they<br>responsibility to run the day-to-day<br>affairs of response with India counties<br>from the standpoint of communities and<br>then we had national international<br>consultative groups that actually had<br>the CDC which of those international<br>agencies to provide technical support<br>and insightful response like I said<br>there were so many individuals and<br>organizations involved we could only<br>keep tab and if you look here we have<br>like 20 and this list is not even<br>exhausting we just on top of my mind<br>some of those that we could recognize at<br>the point in time during the day<br>putnis specifically international<br>partners that were actually involved<br>with the response efforts in the country<br>now Ebola came and hit a health system<br>our health system generally was we were<br>still building it was generally weak so<br>to speak I I wouldn't bite my tongue on<br>this part of it because first hand I<br>know what was happening there was first<br>a limited trained human resource for<br>health our doctor to our doctor to<br>patient ratio is one of the lowest in<br>Africa and even in the world we have<br>even Midwife to patient ratio is also<br>very low<br>we had very poor infection and<br>prevention control system and country<br>and I actually personally did this for<br>my master's thesis to actually look at<br>transmission risk factors to<br>transmission amongst health workers in<br>country because of this this actually<br>late was losing around seven percent<br>seventy eight percent of our trained<br>health workers during our break we also<br>had very limited<br>lab capacity that is something that even<br>after the EVDO break we are still<br>working on I did a lab assessment at the<br>national public of reference lab and the<br>school using the deviation lab<br>assessment tool was 45 percent and when<br>I presented that to the National Public<br>Health Institute<br>there was some concern I was even trying<br>to be good in a sense because they<br>thought that obviously missed<br>a lot to do and if that was if with all<br>of the efforts now that if that is true<br>then even before the outbreak there was<br>something very very big that we did not<br>have we did not have the equipment to do<br>test CDC they were issued they actually<br>physically brought some of these<br>equipment in the PCR I'm talking about<br>the you know to do with larser tests and<br>all that they were actually brought in<br>during our break in order to speed up<br>the turnaround time we did not have<br>those involved we did not have trained<br>people to even use them the at one point<br>we had the US Army and CDC setting up<br>mobile apps that were operated by<br>Americans and other foreigners who at<br>the point in time only because we wanted<br>to speed up the turnaround time for<br>results to be able to respond adequately<br>we have very poor referral system I just<br>before the outbreak I can tell you we<br>did not even have up to 15 functional<br>ambulances in country nationwide so that<br>was actually very poor in fact even its<br>system that looks at referral in itself<br>wasn't very violent in in a sense our<br>surveillance and preparedness capacity<br>was weak we did not have that in place<br>and running for reporting on a daily<br>basis it was done through cell phone<br>someone from the Department of disease<br>prevention and control well on a very<br>beautiful day just take his face off<br>human core 15 persons in the county and<br>with the listing of those 14 conditions<br>hello how many cases of suspected cases<br>of AFP do you have zero that person max<br>that's how reporting was done<br>before the outbreak and which we know in<br>a standard sense that is not the best<br>way to go we also have their poor<br>communication strategy at this point in<br>time when the average stroke there<br>wasn't a single message to communicate<br>with the communities on how to prevent<br>and control we had messages coming from<br>the media and because the Ministry of<br>Health at the time did not have a more<br>structural way of communicating so there<br>were different messages from all around<br>the place and one individual would just<br>go on the internet download anything<br>about bola pasted anywhere else for<br>people to see so there was no formal way<br>of communicating and which led to some<br>of the other challenges that may come up<br>in the next at the start of the outbreak<br>there was some serious issue with<br>finances and I can remember I was in the<br>first-ever meeting that we had and they<br>were just communicate to our first<br>branch of government the legislature to<br>ask them to review upon the Ministry of<br>Finance to make available around 2<br>million United States dollars for<br>initial efforts to respond and there was<br>this senator who has so much influence<br>and he told us Ebola was a scam he did<br>not believe that Ebola exists and in<br>fact the Ministry of Health and many<br>stores held his cohort of people were<br>trying to con them into eating money so<br>that was the initial understanding of<br>what this was about and because we did<br>not have that at that point in time<br>to make some necessary adjustments for<br>initial response that led us to be<br>actually open a more vulnerable for<br>spread so on the initial phase there was<br>this serious issue and then there was<br>this international Rick Morrow between<br>Debbie heo and MSF and other big<br>organizations in understanding how they<br>too could get their hair around response<br>efforts which delayed the availability<br>of the necessary funding for response<br>and then there was the political which<br>are touched on and at the community<br>level some segments of the population<br>felt that this was again another form of<br>corruption that the Ellen Johnson<br>Sirleaf leg of men was trying to create<br>fear in their minds and trying to get<br>money out of the system to enrich<br>themselves so they did not believable I<br>was real and there was serious lack of<br>adherence to messages for prevention and<br>control which one of the major ones was<br>our barrier rights okay in Africa and in<br>Liberia there's this certain group of<br>people who believe that if a person's<br>die<br>if a person dies that person should be<br>washed the body should be washed before<br>burial<br>yes so and after doing that and the<br>those in charge of doing that are very<br>close relatives so they take the body<br>and that person is washed from here too<br>and the family members if this person<br>was great in a sense maybe a religious<br>leader or so each family member had to<br>actually I don't wash his or her hands<br>or face with their meaning what I was<br>used to date their body this was<br>actually a major issue for transmission<br>as we know that when a person dies from<br>Ebola<br>the level of officiousness<br>is almost four times when he or she is<br>alive so you know they the risks of<br>being exposed to infection so this was<br>actually one of the issues that we were<br>faced with and there was a specific<br>strategy crafted and that was done in<br>line with traditional leaders that was<br>done in line with religious leaders to<br>actually talk to people and make them to<br>understand in view of our traditions and<br>customs but there was something that is<br>that exists at the point in time was<br>actually real and was causing people to<br>die and we should try and understand<br>that the Ministry of Health was in place<br>to provide safe and and safe and better<br>barrier for the air relatives so even<br>this after this was put in place there<br>was serious issue with secret barriers<br>so someone dies here and if the<br>community would not pick up that person<br>that okay there is a death in this house<br>the weight on to is night for around<br>midnight and then we go and<br>and so I when that started coming to our<br>knowledge then other operators of the<br>come of the government and the society<br>started getting involved we started<br>getting the police community vigilantes<br>involved to keep watch on secret<br>barriers these were some of the ways<br>that we were able to put some of these<br>on our control and then we had this<br>resistance from the communities I mean<br>it did not believe there was something<br>called Ebola so a person who is maybe<br>suspected of Ebola in this community<br>would move to another community<br>overnight and that's how transmission<br>was actually moving hence they<br>quarantining of West Point at some point<br>in time and then there were also<br>movement of contacts so you have a<br>positive case in a household but this<br>contact were at all contacts were<br>actually move to a different place so<br>keeping in touch with them during<br>contact region activity was actually a<br>challenge for us and then there was the<br>lack of coordination duplication of<br>efforts and all that but then there some<br>lessons we learn over time after this<br>outbreak we actually understood that<br>they need to have an effective Public<br>Health surveillance system that looks at<br>timely detection or<br>cannot be overemphasized we also learned<br>that in all of the biomedical approaches<br>in terms of treatment and all that we<br>shouldn't neglect a human behavior in<br>prevention we also learned that it is<br>important to have messages or message<br>that speaks directly to your target<br>population in terms of their social<br>traditional context and then we learned<br>the need to have this basic PP ease<br>available and to set up a very vibrant<br>and strong infection prevention control<br>mechanism in country which we know that<br>if these things are not put in place<br>tends to result in spread of infection<br>the way forward now in Liberia we are<br>building human capacity for surveillance<br>there have been up to seven cohorts of<br>frontline health workers venturing in a<br>few epidemiology using the CDC and Emory<br>curriculum we've revised our our ideas<br>our strategy there has been two<br>successive<br>training since 2015 with piloted one<br>disease early warning system which I was<br>a part of we did that in four counties<br>and 75 facilities but at the end of it<br>after we evaluated we thought it was too<br>cost-effective<br>not cost-effective I was too costly to<br>run in a country like Liberia because<br>involved using Android phone and the<br>internet and all that so we then came<br>back to establish something we think<br>will be more cost effective and this is<br>pending right now I'm actually one of<br>the coordinators for this project Dei<br>ideas are initiative we're supposed to<br>start in two counties and around 77<br>health facilities hopefully in the next<br>month<br>we have developed some SOPs for IPC we<br>have this bp's been pre positions and<br>encounters and health facilities we have<br>triage facilities and all of our health<br>facilities now which we did not have<br>before we have isolation facilities also<br>in all of our health facilities that we<br>did not have before we have a<br>preparedness plan national one and they<br>dip down several simulations or peer of<br>time there's a national risk reduction<br>management strategy that have been put<br>in place so i actually taught to show<br>you this initiative the e ideas are that<br>i've talked about this is just a diagram<br>of how is going to look like<br>there's primarily two major components<br>of it<br>SMS bit that initiates from the health<br>facility and in this what we call an<br>offline tracker the offline tracker is<br>an app that was developed by a group<br>called ear of africa is basically<br>computer-based desktop based so to speak<br>and then we're actually using the DSS 2<br>which is our overall overarching Asia s<br>platform and basically with the<br>different levels that we have in our<br>health system a an SMS is initiated from<br>a health facility if one suspects a<br>condition and this red lines show where<br>the notifications will go when a person<br>send an SMS so there's a short code and<br>then short code for the disease<br>short code for the hair facility that<br>goes the notification goes to the<br>district have officer the County Health<br>Officer district surveillance officer<br>County surveillance officer and the<br>National Public Health Institute as well<br>as the national reference lab they<br>counted diagnostic officer and riders<br>for health riders for health after the<br>outbreak CDC contracted them they are<br>solely responsible for transportation of<br>specimens from the point of collection<br>to our laboratories so for example if<br>one suspects the case of measles and<br>send that SMS alert it goes to the lab<br>so that the lab is a way that sample<br>have been collected for that condition<br>so they get prepared to receive it it<br>goes to the County diagnostic officers<br>charged with the responsibility of<br>diagnosing diseases in County and then<br>rattles for help for pickup and then<br>that notification also goes to the D s<br>all the CS go for verification and to<br>make sure that this conforms to the case<br>definition<br>now that's something the bill does take<br>a guys they call st. sailor it's<br>actually a cloud-based server that syncs<br>information or data from SMS to the<br>offline tracker<br>now this DSO we use whatever information<br>from the SMS and the case alert form<br>that they as normally fill out when a<br>case is suspected to populate and<br>complete a line list for that case<br>and up here there's another version of<br>the offline tracker that is used by the<br>lab and the lab actually input only<br>results for that condition which is then<br>sent in here and up to the deasia s2<br>tracker this thi s2 tracker is like an<br>extension of the DHS - that works are<br>specifically individual sub databases<br>within DHS - and in this case is for<br>surveillance<br>people usually at times they can develop<br>tracker for HIV treatment they can<br>develop tracker for maternal and child<br>health<br>so those are just soft databases with in<br>that they the overall thi s - now this<br>information is up here and ready for use<br>I'm told<br>like Bureau will be one of the few<br>countries that at the end of the day<br>this works we'll have some form of<br>patient based information for<br>surveillance ready for data analysis and<br>decision making so then I'm happy to be<br>sitting up here and hopefully being able<br>to look at some of these analytics as<br>they come what we want to do for our<br>next step is to actually evaluate this<br>Eid cell system basically looking using<br>the CDC framework for surveillance<br>system evaluation that looks at<br>assessing seven system attributes and<br>ensuring that the southern system is<br>meeting its objectives and you can<br>pretty much identify strengths and<br>weaknesses and address them as as we go<br>along<br>now we want to take this one step<br>further so we know that the surveillance<br>system as it is now we're only looking<br>at human the human aspect of the health<br>system so we think we want to step it<br>one step to have a one health approach<br>to surveillance in Liberia and one of<br>the reasons why I'm here in New Zealand<br>today is because true professor Hill and<br>professor Roger Maris there was this<br>project that started last year Trueba<br>the involved building a risk profile<br>mapping system for transmission of<br>infection from animals to human using a<br>software called handi - so we're trying<br>to see how in the very near future we<br>can have a link between our human<br>surveillance in one place as well as<br>Eric's mapping surveillance in another<br>place and having the true to talk to<br>each other<br>so as to have an enhance surveillance<br>within within the country with this I<br>want to recognize the University of<br>Otago department of prevention and<br>preventive and social medicine professor<br>Hill and dr. Crum and I also want to<br>recognize the master University and<br>episode of international of Morris and<br>his team the World Bank was actually<br>paying for this project and the Ministry<br>of Health Liberia<br>and I want to thank you all for<br>listening thank you for your patience<br>have some indication that I may have<br>gone beyond the allocated time but thank<br>yeah I think I read that and like one of<br>the things I said some of the reasons<br>why there was very limited resources<br>available during a start of the outbreak<br>we blame our government locally and we<br>also blame the international<br>institutions like the reshow so one word<br>order responsible for provision of<br>somebody's support so I guess I I read a<br>report that Debbie issued to blame for<br>the initial spread because they were not<br>curious of the system in your clinical<br>case definition so what sort of patients<br>trigger a little baklava retails for a<br>bowl of virus disease is it just paper<br>and the existing lots of people is it<br>fever yes so it's fever was at at least<br>three of the other symptoms that I show<br>in one of the slides so you have fever<br>may be vomiting intestine gas content<br>intestinal symptoms to include nausea<br>vomiting and also his fever plus at<br>least three order that will well<br>actually for lack of a better word<br>certified a person being a suspected<br>case for a meeting okay I think we're<br>being pushed out of here so if you want</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
