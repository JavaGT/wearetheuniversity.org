and Green Lane and then came down<br>here and set up the southern thoracic<br>unit to treat man.you tuberculosis in<br>those days with other inflammatory<br>diseases those of you who knew John John<br>was a wonderful human being he was<br>passionate about a surgery but he was<br>passionate about life he had some<br>fantastic sayings but he always had as<br>his main purpose in life to help to aid<br>people to help students to teach and to<br>help people get through the careers I<br>understand that he admit he was man who<br>got me into cardiothoracic surgery and I<br>attended with our doctor John or people<br>people might have a lot to John but that<br>he was the person who pointed me in the<br>right direction John comes from past<br>present and future medical royalty you<br>look in the phone book and find many<br>bodies with doctor before their name and<br>I think that's still continuing just<br>speaking to some of the current members<br>who's next progeny are also going into<br>the profession of Medicine so we wanted<br>to set this visiting professorship up<br>and honor of John when John said to the<br>trust up he then enlisted the help of<br>the hair slops John and Barbara and as<br>you know John and barber passed on but<br>we made a significant contribution to<br>the hizzle OPTrust - in terms of what<br>it's and trying to do<br>we have 60 to 90 students that come to a<br>six-week course from Australia New<br>Zealand that is the most successful<br>course in Australasia you want to pass<br>your surgical exam and that's all come<br>from the embryonic see that John Barry<br>sewed in 1957<br>so this professorship is to honor John<br>and a place to see and a significant<br>number of members of the bar family here<br>tonight when Jim Reed is also driving<br>force behind this weed nutted out who<br>would be the ideal recipient of a John<br>Barry traveling professor then Murray<br>Brennan's name was come right to the top<br>it is true that if you're down at<br>particular profession and not widely<br>known outside the profession people<br>don't quite understand the immunes<br>contribution that some people have made<br>to their endeavors it's fair to say<br>without embarrassing Murray he's<br>probably as young as most famous medical<br>export in terms of what he's achieved<br>overseas he's a graduate of the tag of<br>course comes back here well oddly<br>frequently he played a few games for<br>Tiger with a larger number on his back<br>out on the three quarters was very<br>successful rugby player he then went to<br>a very prestigious hospital could the<br>peeterman Brigham Hospital in Boston and<br>Harvard became a fellow there did<br>research an association with Harvard and<br>the Joslin clinic I've got interested in<br>metabolic disease a surgical metabolic<br>diseases mu self and the ended up being<br>here to surgery at the memorial stone<br>Kuhn Hospital which is one of the most<br>prestigious hospitals in America his<br>name appears on 1,000 publications he's<br>a man who can talk about 10,000 sarcomas<br>and the treatment and so in terms of<br>experience and in terms of expertise<br>heals without peer in terms of what he<br>can bring to any discussion so as I said<br>it was a no brainer who the verse the<br>first professor would would be and it's<br>my pleasure to to welcome Murray here we<br>thank him very much for taking time<br>you're still very busy and he's taking<br>time out to come and be part of this<br>occasion for those of you who drink wee<br>bit of wine you might note that the name<br>Brennan Pinot Noir who's just voted one<br>of the top tea and Pinot Noirs in New<br>Zealand slightly hit a rock burn I have<br>to say but we're also in the top ten but<br>having<br>but having said that there that's Merri<br>son who's growing grapes and making wine<br>up the Gibson Valley<br>so thank you all for coming there'll be<br>a very interesting evening and now I'd<br>good evening everybody my name is<br>Michelle Coleman I'm from the division<br>of Health Sciences at the University and<br>and can you hear me now<br>sorry my name is Michelle Coleman I'm<br>from the division of Health Sciences at<br>the University still can't hear okay<br>I'll try and speak very loudly it's my<br>job to introduce you to two wonderful<br>people who are at the completely other<br>end of the career cycle briefly speaking<br>to you tonight are going to be two PhD<br>students at the University and they are<br>the first recipients of the MacGibbon<br>travel fellowship this is a new<br>fellowship which has been enabled by a<br>donation from one of our alumnus one of<br>our alumni dr. John McGivern John<br>McGivern spent most of his life living<br>and working in America at the John<br>Hopkins University and we're very<br>grateful to sir Murray for reminding<br>John Gibbon that this would be a very<br>useful thing for him to do so this<br>funding has enabled and will continue to<br>enable in prepare in perpetuity students<br>from this university to go and work in<br>America during their PhDs for between<br>two and six months or maybe even up to a<br>year and this is fantastic opportunity<br>for these students and we have two<br>people here tonight who are going to<br>give you a little bit about their<br>experience of working in America in<br>research so firstly I would like to<br>invite Deana barwick who is currently<br>doing PhD in the Department of anatomy<br>with dr. Andrew Clarkson and she has<br>spent some time at the University of<br>California so I'd like you to welcome<br>Deana<br>Thank You Michelle<br>and I firstly just want to again<br>introduce myself so I am Deanna Barwick<br>and I'm doing my PhD here at Otago<br>University for my PhD topic I am<br>investigating ways to improve<br>post-stroke recovery by targeting the<br>molecular mechanisms sorry is that the<br>volume again no oh okay okay<br>like is this alright okay thank you so<br>firstly so I just want to start with<br>what actually is stroke so a stroke<br>occurs when there is a disruption of<br>blood flow to the brain and this<br>disruption causes a lack of oxygen to<br>reach the brain cells which results in<br>cell death which can be the impairments<br>we see in the patient so there are two<br>types of stroke we have an ischemic<br>stroke which is from a blockage of the<br>blood vessel and is also a hemorrhagic<br>stroke which has when the vessel bursts<br>so roughly 90 percent of strokes we see<br>are ischemic strokes so why is stroke<br>important it is a leading cause of death<br>in disability worldwide with millions of<br>people suffering impairments each year<br>so in New Zealand currently 60,000<br>people are living with a disability from<br>stroke so that account accounts to<br>roughly 2% of the population so it's a<br>very big statistic so when investigating<br>recovery there are three important<br>factors first is rehabilitation which<br>could be things such as physiotherapy<br>this can be either physical or cognitive<br>there are therapies which we can apply<br>which could be drug or cell mediated to<br>improve recovery and thirdly this<br>plasticity of the brain which is the<br>brain's ability to form new connections<br>or remove ones which are already there<br>so it's been seen older people suffer<br>larger impairments when the stroke size<br>doesn't differ this suggests that there<br>may be an inability for the brain to<br>form new connections or to remap old<br>ones it has been shown that if we can<br>manipulate external spreading when<br>tracing we can improve a patient's<br>outcome<br>so while motor impairments have been the<br>main focus with physiotherapy cognitive<br>impairments haven't really been looked<br>at and here in Otago at the Clarkson lab<br>we're trying to establish a model of<br>cognitive stroke so during my time<br>abroad I was based in Los Angeles at the<br>David Geffen Medical School of UCLA and<br>I was working under the supervision of<br>Professor Tom Carmichael in Neurology<br>Tom is one of the leaders in the field<br>of stroke recovery and he is that expert<br>in post stroke repair so in particular<br>the sprouting of new connections so the<br>fellowship allowed me to travel abroad<br>and work closely with an incredible<br>postdoc and Tom's lab dr. Tina joy and I<br>worked on two and vivo experiments<br>investigating ex-owner sprouting and<br>stroke so there were two aims the first<br>experiment we did to test a novel<br>treatment on external sprouting<br>following motor stroke and the second<br>experiment was to investigate changes in<br>connectivity following prefrontal stroke<br>so the fellowship was an extremely<br>useful opportunity and allowing me to<br>learn new techniques from the most<br>experienced in the field I spent many<br>hours in the lab perfecting these<br>techniques and applying them to the<br>experiments at hand preliminary findings<br>show a loss of connectivity between<br>regions involved in cognitive processing<br>and there's an early indication to show<br>that we can rescue this impairment with<br>a novel treatment and since returning to<br>New Zealand I'm now in the process of<br>establishing these methods here at Otago<br>to do further studies and also to<br>confirm our findings I would love to<br>thank the alumni of University of Otago<br>in America and also the Margaret big<br>terrible trust for making this trip<br>possible also an acknowledgement to mbae<br>for funding the project and I like to<br>acknowledge dr. Andrew Clarkson at<br>University of Otago my supervisor for<br>your support<br>very Institute in particular dr. Olga's<br>of Cova<br>she's the one who's creating the<br>compounds which I'm testing and also<br>special thanks to the University of<br>California Los Angeles in particular Tom<br>Carmichael posting me and dr. Tina joy<br>for all the mentorship yeah thank you so<br>much<br>Thank You Deanna this is the biggest<br>group she's ever spoken to secondly I'd<br>like to introduce you to Amy Dowdle Amy<br>Dowdle is working in the Department of<br>Pathology at the Dunedin School of<br>Medicine and under the supervision of<br>associate professor julia horse build<br>and she has been working at the stars<br>Institute in Kansas City so without<br>further ado Amy<br>thought I'd give it a go can you hear me<br>yep okay great okay so um first of all<br>again I just want to thank the alumni of<br>the University of Otago in America for<br>providing the fellowship to go to the<br>United States for six months it was a<br>wonderful opportunity I enjoyed it very<br>much and as you will see it was a really<br>excellent way to kick off my PhD so I<br>went to Kansas City as Michelle<br>mentioned and when I told people that I<br>was going to be spending six months in<br>Kansas City I invariably got two<br>responses<br>the first being some kind of Wizard of<br>Oz reference and the second being why so<br>the first I usually responded with a<br>polite laugh despite having heard the<br>same joke dozens of times already and to<br>the second I answered it was quite easy<br>why Kansas City Kansas City because<br>that's where the Stowers Institute is so<br>the Stowers Institute is this fantastic<br>amazing basic Medical Research Institute<br>it's one of the leading basic medical<br>research institutes in the United States<br>and if not the world so it's a really<br>really great place to go and just do<br>science they have lots of they have so<br>many resources and and wonderful<br>incredible talented people that you are<br>just able to go and knock on the door<br>and pick their brains when you feel good<br>excuse me whenever you've got any type<br>of problem any type of issue you want to<br>troubleshoot an experiment everyone's<br>doors always open it was an incredible<br>time for me and for my science so the<br>Stowers Institute highly recommend it<br>especially if you want to do any type of<br>sequencing which is what I did I spent<br>time in the lab of Jennifer Gerson and<br>and she works on cohesin which is a<br>protein complex so we are also<br>interested in an our lab but if I talked<br>a little bit about my research first I'm<br>in the lab of Julie our host field in<br>the pathology department Julie is here<br>tonight and we investigate zygotic<br>genome activation in zebrafish so we use<br>zebrafish as our model organism but<br>psychotic genome activation is a process<br>that actually happens in all animals and<br>it actually also happens in some plants<br>so what it is it's a time it's a time<br>and development in early development<br>where the genes switch on in the embryo<br>so you might be interested to know as I<br>was when I began this project that the<br>embryos genes are in fact off right at<br>the beginning of development<br>so following fertilization of the egg<br>and and in early development<br>developments being driven by maternal<br>factors so proteins that were prison in<br>the egg at the time of fertilization<br>they're telling the embryo what to do<br>how to divide how to develop and the<br>embryos genes are off they're not doing<br>anything but at a certain point and as<br>you can see on this graph here at this<br>figure along the bottom this is showing<br>zebrafish development across time so the<br>rid is where the embryos chains are off<br>but you can see at the end a couple of<br>small waves the embryos genes begin to<br>switch on and they take over in Matera<br>they take over from the maternal program<br>they shut down the maternal controller<br>development and they take over for<br>themselves which if any of you in the<br>audience of parents you might like that<br>sounds a little familiar right so that's<br>what happens it's like garlic genome<br>activation but the mechanism for that is<br>actually unclear we've got some clues as<br>to what might be happening but we have<br>no real picture of what the actual<br>trigger for switching those genes on is<br>so that's what I was looking at during<br>my time in Kansas City so for the<br>purposes of time because of course I<br>don't want to take away any longer from<br>Mary's talk I'm just gonna talk a little<br>bit about why the McGovern fellowship<br>was so great and what I gathered as a<br>fellow during my time so of course the<br>the the the biggest thing certainly that<br>Julie is really excited about and my<br>supervisor and of course to me for my<br>PhD is that I was able to produce just a<br>stack of data I was able to produce so<br>much data because of the resources<br>available there and the people I was<br>able to enlist to help and so I was able<br>to produce data in six months I would<br>have taken at least 12 maybe 18 months<br>in New Zealand to have done the same<br>thing so the same with the same level of<br>quality so that was that's very exciting<br>secondly I was able to learn new skills<br>and again go and pick people's brains<br>learn these new skills that I<br>immediately brought back to New Zealand<br>and started using straightaway<br>particularly in the areas of<br>bioinformatics which is sort of a<br>notoriously a school it's quite<br>difficult to pick up unless you've got<br>people who are willing to be emailed at<br>2:00 a.m. which happens so that was<br>great I was also able to establish<br>collaborations so with Jennifer Griffin<br>the PA whose lab I spent time in at<br>Stowers who have now formally got a<br>collaboration between our two labs and I<br>also personally was able to establish my<br>own<br>network of connections people who I can<br>now call on to help with countering<br>problems or in future if I might like a<br>job and finally it was really great to<br>spend time in a different culture and in<br>a different way of life so Kansas City<br>of course is very different to Dunedin<br>in many ways and America itself is<br>vastly different to New Zealand as I'm<br>sure many of you can appreciate so I<br>just want to leave you oh okay well I'll<br>leave you with a few photos that have<br>been mysteriously rearranged but there's<br>a few photos of my time in Kansas City<br>or in Kansas the wider Kansas area I'm<br>really you're just missing some prairie<br>grass so it's okay you can imagine what<br>that looks like<br>and this is the nelson-atkins museum<br>which is this is like a symbol these<br>shuttlecocks on the lawn or a symbol of<br>Kansas City and I would walk past them<br>every night on my way home and so for me<br>that's a real reminder of my time we<br>like at the Stowers Institute so finally<br>I can I just want to thank the<br>University of Otago alumni in America<br>I'm Mary Brennan for the fellowship and<br>all of you here tonight for allowing me<br>to spend some time talking to you thank<br>you well it's now my pleasure to<br>introduce my friend Murray professor<br>summerlee Brennan who I think is<br>probably the the most lustrous living<br>graduate of the deleting School of<br>Medicine he does come from okay he's a<br>graduate here just just before my time<br>and he's the holder of the inaugural<br>John burry professorial fellowship and<br>we hope that this will be an annual<br>event we're going to have a John burry<br>professorial fellow each year from now<br>on Murray spent most of all of his<br>professional career in the United States<br>and he's held many prestigious posts he<br>is a grand companion of the New Zealand<br>Order of Merit and one of only eight in<br>this country I'm really going to<br>introduce him without with a story which<br>I promise you is a true story and I'm<br>sorry Murray has heard this before and I<br>hope I don't embarrass him my wife and I<br>were in London and the early<br>and we went to I think it was an Angus<br>Steakhouse but it might have been a Tony<br>Roma's or somewhere like that and we<br>were going out for a show and we sat<br>down in the restaurant and there was a<br>young man sitting just right in the next<br>table to us and my wife got up and went<br>to the to the bathroom and I got talking<br>to him just and it transpired that he<br>was a young surgeon from New York and he<br>had come to London to do a surgical<br>course and I said wait where do you<br>where are you working in New York and he<br>said I'm I'm very junior he said but<br>I've got myself a job at the Sloan<br>Kettering and as Derek has told you the<br>Sloan Kettering is one of the foremost<br>cancer cancer hospitals all cancer<br>institutes in the world and I said are<br>you working at the sloan-kettering I<br>said you you might know if my heard of a<br>friend of mine he said ah<br>it's a very big place and he said I'm<br>very I'm very junior and I said well if<br>you've heard of Marie Brennan and he<br>said Marie Brennan<br>I thought you gave me this thing to make<br>thank you very much I hope those of you<br>with any kind of faith look to a<br>different God than me John McGivern it<br>was an interesting man he was a graduate<br>okay does that work does it work if I<br>speak loudly okay so John McGivern was a<br>graduate of the school he spent 50 years<br>at Hopkins and when I was talking to him<br>about giving some money to Otago I<br>didn't think that he and before I can<br>finish the sentence so that was the<br>so thank you very much for this very<br>distinguished award john-boy was a<br>teacher of mine and there's only two<br>people there's only one person to be<br>more surprised than him that I'm<br>standing here fifty years later talking<br>to you and that's me but he did he did<br>teach me a great deal I must say he had<br>a lot more faith in me than I had at<br>that time you know he founded the<br>training program that you heard he was<br>awarded several Mountain medals he<br>retired in 1980 and of course he died at<br>91 and you heard dr. Banton refer to the<br>fact he wrote a book about his<br>experiences as a prisoner of war during<br>which time he actually studied I believe<br>for the exam he passed so quickly<br>in in London so barri family the trust<br>the foundation thank you very much how<br>are we doing on the sound all right<br>I've pleased someone in the room if the<br>talks no good it's your fault what I'd<br>like to tell you a little bit about is<br>the role of the institution I've worked<br>at for 30-plus years and it's very<br>interesting Memorial sloan-kettering was<br>founded exactly the same year as the<br>denied an art gallery art galleries<br>first started 1884 and it was founded by<br>a man who was a gynecologist and it was<br>founded because in those days woman with<br>gynecological malignancy were not<br>admitted to public hospitals because it<br>was assumed to be an infectious disease<br>so J Marion Sims suggested we needed a<br>cancer hospital predominantly for woman<br>with gynecological malignancy he<br>actually died before the hospital was<br>opened and it was predominantly<br>supported a by the Rockefeller family<br>and B by the Astor family and they<br>provide a lot of the resources and we<br>can talk about that over cocktails I'm a<br>surgeon this is John Hunter surgery is<br>like an armed savage who attempts to get<br>that by force which a civilized man<br>would get by stratagem<br>250 years ago and I'm still a surgeon I<br>still believe that 75% of all patients<br>cured of cancer have a surgical<br>operation of one sort or another what<br>hunter was actually telling us though<br>was not really how bad surgery was it<br>was the fact that biology almost<br>invariably if not always will defeat<br>technique and I'll tell you about how<br>that works the evolution of surgery<br>particularly in the United States and it<br>really did develop for the world was led<br>by this gentleman William halston now<br>Halsted<br>like Gibbon of course was at Hopkins he<br>was the foundation professor of surgery<br>and he wrote a memoir in 1907 about the<br>results of radical operations for the<br>Cure of cancer of the breast the Halsted<br>radical mastectomy and this was a<br>radical operation this was taking the<br>female breast the muscles beneath it the<br>lymph nodes in the axilla the armpit the<br>lymph nodes in the supraclavicular fossa<br>now he was a professor and he wrote and<br>he documented his data you don't need<br>the details but you can see he said what<br>he did he said how many people survived<br>and then of course he told what he did<br>either the lymph nodes in the neck and<br>the lymph nodes in the armpit were<br>negative and those patients did a lot<br>better than people who had what we'd<br>call nodal metastases no surprise<br>knowing what we know now but horse dead<br>like me was a professor so he then<br>decided to interpret his own data<br>completely unsubstantiated<br>for instance interesting to note how<br>late metastasis occurred in those cases<br>without auxilary involvement another<br>reason for wide operating of course the<br>first statements true the second one is<br>false and neither a mother are related<br>the other thing he said was that the<br>liability now there's no data to address<br>this in the manuscript it just says the<br>liability of a boned or cancerous mattel<br>increases with its proximity to the site<br>of the primary growth well that would<br>mean that every woman had a breast<br>cancer would get a<br>metastases in her clavicle or humerus he<br>had to know that wasn't true but didn't<br>matter the other thing that was very<br>surprising he said the liver may be<br>invaded by way of the deep fascia Linea<br>so for those who are not anatomist that<br>means that you have a tumor in your<br>breast<br>it grows down the abdominal wall somehow<br>gets through the wall jumps across the<br>perineum into the liver<br>now what was even worse he was had spent<br>time in Europe and more than 25 years<br>early zappy and described the actual<br>lymph node drainage of to the axilla so<br>here's an example of what I'm going to<br>do to myself a little bit later it's a<br>great temptation if you're a professor<br>and you supposedly have some authority<br>to provide the data and then interpret<br>and decide something completely<br>different and every physician in the<br>room has seen that happen at the same<br>time of course Vercoe who was a<br>pathologist had suggested that the<br>reason you got spread of a tumor the<br>reason you got a metastasis was the<br>tumor went to small blood vessels lodged<br>there and grow and that was sustained<br>for a very long time<br>however Paget had described the fact<br>that the the body was not and we know<br>this very clearly now independent of the<br>environment in which the cancer was<br>going to grow and remote organs cannot<br>be passive in other words a tumor<br>whether it's from the breast or it will<br>actually see C select the environment<br>they want and are favorable to growth<br>and we know that very clearly now but as<br>you'll see Memorial sloan-kettering did<br>not accept that for a very long time<br>plant goes to seed at seeds are carried<br>in all directions<br>they only live and grow if they fall on<br>clean your collegiate con genial soil<br>and we know that now and we'll come back<br>to it but I'm getting sidetracked<br>at Memorial sloan-kettering they<br>actually embraced the whole sted<br>philosophy it was a hospital of<br>incredibly aggressive surgery and these<br>three people to the right urban bronx<br>wagon Peck were surgeons that saw bigger<br>and better operations with a solution to<br>cancer really aggressive<br>operations a pelvic examination is where<br>you take out the bladder the colon the<br>bowel you end up with two stomas it's a<br>huge operation and it was done<br>predominantly at that time for custom of<br>the cervix because there was no other<br>treatment but they did have long<br>survivors Brunswick is interesting for<br>me as a surgeon because we have an<br>operation it's called removing the<br>pancreas in the Jordan 'm that's always<br>attributed to Whipple a Whipple<br>operation Brunswick actually a<br>gynecologist did that operation before<br>Whipple but he rarely is God of course<br>the Americans are fantastically good we<br>are fantastically good ignoring the fact<br>that Kraus had done it about 40 years<br>earlier but no one talks about it as the<br>Kraus operation it's about the Whipple<br>operation<br>now George Peck was a very interesting<br>man a similarly very aggressive surgeon<br>now he was an upper abdominal surgeon he<br>did operations on the stomach he should<br>have been the one that did the pancreas<br>operation Brunswick was a gynecologist<br>he should have been the person that did<br>the gynecological procedures but it was<br>Peck who went to define aggressive<br>operations and was he was the one that<br>did the hysterectomy on Eva Peron now<br>that in itself is interesting because<br>now we have an upper GI surgeon because<br>of his promise going to buy nurseries to<br>remove Eva perón's uterus at a time when<br>she already had metastatic disease<br>something that we know is completely<br>absurd to remove the primary in the<br>presence of extensive metastases and of<br>course she died quite quickly thereafter<br>and there's a great story about the<br>accusations that she brought it on<br>herself because of her prior activities<br>when in fact it was probably mr. Peron<br>who was the villain because who know it<br>was HPV the first alternative to these<br>radical operations of course was as a<br>consequence of the development of<br>radiation therapy and Marie Curie first<br>woman to win on nobel prize first person<br>to win two Nobel prizes and of course<br>went on to die of leukemia almost<br>certainly radiation<br>in juice and that's James Ewing now<br>Ewing was the first clinical director<br>after the turn of the century at<br>Memorial so he's a pathologist he brings<br>radiation to Memorial sloan-kettering<br>he's got all these incredibly aggressive<br>surgeons he doesn't believe in<br>aggressive surgery he believes in<br>radiation he has to deal with people<br>like Peck and Brunswick Ewing in fact<br>Challenge pageant he wanted Vercoe to be<br>right he wanted to say that these tumors<br>went and they got into small vessels and<br>then they just grew there and as you<br>appreciate that's not true<br>merely by the lodgement he wrote a book<br>on neoplastic diseases probably one of<br>the finest early treatises of the<br>pathology and he described a tumor that<br>bears his name the Ewing sarcoma<br>something that I'd been interested in<br>for a long time he was one of the first<br>people to recognize the potential for<br>radiation therapy suggesting in this<br>incredibly aggressive surgical hospital<br>that there was an alternative a most<br>unexpected source experimental physics a<br>new and powerful weapon brought into<br>play now there was a gentleman James<br>Douglas a mining engineer a very<br>powerful wealthy philanthropist in New<br>York who was the first to bring radium<br>to the United States and it came to<br>Memorial sloan-kettering the other<br>person which is of great interest now<br>given what we know almost what 80 years<br>later William Coley was the pioneer of<br>immunotherapy he recognized this is<br>Coley in 1892 that patients who got<br>their tumors infected some of them went<br>away and so he developed a series of<br>toxins which were bacterial toxins which<br>were directly injected into the tumor<br>and described several and this is an<br>example of his first case in 1899 after<br>63 injections you can see this<br>gentleman's tumor of the faces<br>essentially disappeared that was almost<br>certainly a sarcoma and initially again<br>great great prominence but of course it<br>fell into disrepute when it other people<br>couldn't<br>produce it that's his original paper<br>that's the description of what he did<br>and if you look carefully it's probable<br>in later life for them physicians in the<br>room he almost certainly had a pituitary<br>adenoma by the look of him he's got he's<br>got big mandible this woman I met she<br>was his daughter she was a woman who<br>promoted the cause of quote Coley's<br>toxins was laughed at by many but funded<br>a lot of research at our place and now<br>of course immunotherapy is finally<br>finally coming of age and now we know<br>this is Judd ballcock is a melanoma guy<br>at our place the evolving aspects of<br>doesn't matter anti CTL a just looking<br>at things that interrupt the body's<br>response you know whenever we get an<br>infection we have immune response it<br>goes away the body has a way to turn<br>that off so this is the converse that<br>body responds to a tumor and we stop the<br>immune response from turning off and<br>it's truly immunotherapy because the<br>patient gets treated nothing happens of<br>anything the tumor grows you stop the<br>treatment and then 10 weeks later it's<br>gone so that's a true immunological<br>event so Coley deserved considerable and<br>this is another example now the other<br>thing that happened of course at that<br>time was the evolution of chemotherapy<br>and that of course came from another<br>tragedy because that came from World War<br>one where we noticed that nitrogen<br>mustard knocked out the white cells of<br>people they died because they had no<br>immune response they had no white blood<br>cells so the thought was maybe that<br>would work for white cell tumors<br>leukemias the reason I put Cushing and<br>Rosalee here is because of course<br>Cushing who was the professor of surgery<br>at the Brigham where I trained was the<br>person who was present at the time of<br>Revere always Osler's death from a brain<br>injury in World War one and he actually<br>then went on to write the great<br>definitive biography of OWSLA although<br>he was a surgeon and won a Pulitzer<br>Prize for that order by for that<br>biography this is the first example of<br>that<br>it's an example of the use of nitrogen<br>mustard it's hard for you to see but<br>this man has a big big tumor here in his<br>exile or most certainly in retrospect it<br>would be a lymphoma as we now know and<br>that disappears with the use of nitrogen<br>mustard and that was done at Yale and<br>they described the use of that in 1946<br>now remember we've got all these<br>incredibly aggressive surgeons at<br>Memorial doing bigger and greater<br>operations Ewing believes in radiation<br>therapy and along comes Goodman and<br>Gilman to say there is another way and<br>they found that in these patients and<br>you can see they're all what we'd call<br>lymphoid or blood based tumors that this<br>agent could make a difference and it<br>nearly every age some benefit was<br>obtained now at Memorial that they were<br>the first to actually use a new anti<br>metabolite it was a something called 6mp<br>Sigma cap toe peering and again in the<br>treatment of leukemia Burstyn all<br>karnovski inroads and for the physicians<br>in the room now can offski described a<br>scale of how well a patient could<br>tolerate it now if you look carefully<br>this this is in November 1953<br>so in the background we've got Ewing is<br>promoted radiation therapy in<br>immunotherapy has been ignored and the<br>surgeons are still doing this bigger and<br>bigger and greater operations now this<br>doesn't sound great does it of the 55<br>children with acute leukemia aged 2 to<br>12 hematological and clinical remissions<br>after 2 to 9<br>these remissions have lasted from 2 to<br>22 weeks that doesn't sound very good<br>does it but no one had ever seen a<br>response to child or leukemia and this<br>was the basis of the development and<br>treatment of childhood leukemia this is<br>the James Ewing Hospital this is where<br>Ewing's there and this is very typical<br>of New York after a little while someone<br>else comes along with a little more<br>money so he knocked the name off the<br>building and now it's called the<br>Schwartz building and I expect by the<br>time I get back someone else will have<br>given more money it'll have another name<br>but here we are 1952 I've just told you<br>about radiation therapy chemotherapy<br>immunotherapy in the same<br>here's urban saying oh the operations<br>not big enough we need to take out more<br>of the female breasts the female chest<br>wall we need to take out the lymph nodes<br>behind the the the ribcage behind the<br>sternum something that dr. Bari could do<br>but certainly I hope never did now<br>there's an interesting New Zealand side<br>light to this this here you all know the<br>story of the Chariots of Fire and many<br>of you will know the basis of that was<br>of course the Olympic Games in Paris in<br>1924<br>now 1924 arthur part from new zealand<br>ran third in the hundred meters that was<br>the basis of the Chariots of Fire story<br>the person of course who's supposed to<br>have won the hundred was Eric Liddell<br>the Scotsman but of course Liddell could<br>not run in the hundred meters because<br>the seats were on a Sunday and his<br>Presbyterian faith would not allow that<br>and Liddell of course went on to die as<br>a medical missionary of a brain tumor in<br>in China but that meant that Arthur<br>Porat distinguished New Zealand had<br>Liddell one would not have come thirty<br>would have come forth but Porat was one<br>of the very purpose people to suggest<br>that there was a lesser operation for<br>breast cancer female he wasn't the only<br>one but he was at a time where he<br>practiced the idea that a lesser<br>operation had equivalent outcomes and he<br>wrote a very thoughtful single author<br>people in the British sir Sir G and in<br>The Lancet summing up one can fairly say<br>without decreasing survival a simple<br>method has been employed eliminated<br>deformity and reduce morbidity now that<br>wasn't a randomized trial but he made<br>that observation wasn't the only one but<br>he was one of the really pioneers and so<br>there's a contribution of another New<br>Zealander and this is says simple<br>down-to-earth and therefore probably<br>contentious contribution how thoughtful<br>that is increasing knowledge of the<br>essential nature indicate each interval<br>as a natural growth you get that feeling<br>of Padgett it's it's about the host<br>tumor interaction and here he<br>articulated it very well and of course<br>he came ultimately to be the government<br>general I met a pirate part<br>as a visiting professor at the Brigham<br>when when I was a resident he's one of<br>only two people was ever to be a pro<br>temporary visitor at the Brigham twice<br>and this was before any randomized trial<br>this was 25 years before we began<br>randomised trials in in the United<br>States so that piece that says you<br>should recognize people who went before<br>you just checking the time um and a<br>number of examples of that these two<br>gentlemen Stewart was a pathologist<br>Reeves was a breast surgeon and in the<br>first edition of cancer in 1948<br>described an entity that occurred after<br>these aggressive operations and I'm not<br>quite sure you'll be able to handle all<br>these pictures but nothing I can do<br>about it<br>so they described a that called lymph<br>angiosarcoma that developed in the<br>presence of these complications of these<br>big operations these big radiation<br>fields this is a patient of mine this is<br>not radiation induced sarcoma because<br>you can see this woman has a lesion<br>there she has one there the radiation<br>field is up here has it there and this<br>is essentially a death sentence it's<br>important because we now know that there<br>are both lymph edema swelling of the arm<br>and radiation and Guice sarcomas if you<br>just look at these patients followed at<br>the Institute Korea where when you<br>expect one but there's multiply it by<br>four there's only three thousand four<br>sarcomas thirty-five was seen so we know<br>very clearly that radiation is<br>associated with the development cancer<br>it's uncommon but it's very important<br>because in fact in the United States and<br>perhaps in in New Zealand the majority<br>of woman with this disease ductal<br>carcinoma in situ which is called<br>carcinoma but really isn't<br>receive radiation and they receive it<br>based on very good information<br>randomized control trial of the use of<br>radiation or not following an operation<br>for this disease and there's no question<br>the incidence or prevalence of<br>or occurrences haft a good event but if<br>you look carefully there is no<br>difference in ultimate metastasis which<br>of course is the cause of death but<br>what's even more important is that of<br>those that received the radiation and<br>recurred 90% 90% could be rescued by a<br>single operation now this is standard of<br>care in the United States but for those<br>of you with high school math just think<br>about it if everybody received radiation<br>12% we recur 8% cannot be resected less<br>than 1% actually can be salvaged and the<br>converse of everyone gets radiation 27<br>if nobody gets radiation basically the<br>numbers say that the overall benefit<br>actually is less than 1% why is that<br>important well it's important because<br>there are lots of side effects of<br>radiation and here's a typical example<br>apologies for those you're not<br>comfortable this is a patient of mine<br>young woman as DCIS comes in and she's<br>got a large sarcoma involving the breast<br>and chest wall no problem I can remove<br>that I can resect the chest wall Reap<br>and place it put it back together but<br>six months later a chest is full of<br>tumor and we've replaced a non lethal<br>disease with a lethal disease now I'm<br>not saying that people should not get a<br>radiation I'm saying and we'll come to a<br>solution to this problem it has to be<br>done much more objectively than we've<br>done in the past because we're actually<br>making this diagnosis 31 16 times more<br>than we did just 25 years ago the<br>disease was always there and if we know<br>that we're going to make this<br>complication then it's it's exaggerated<br>fortunately people are beginning to<br>realize that and it's going to change<br>one of the things has allowed me perhaps<br>to have some success was that I was<br>fortunate enough during medical school<br>to do a degree in mathematics and that<br>helped me enormous Lee I didn't know<br>what I was doing I did a certificate of<br>statistics I was not the number one<br>student in the class by any means if I<br>was in the first upper 50% I'll take it<br>but I did have this background to begin<br>looking at things and subsequently began<br>to examine sarcoma and we recently<br>described our first 10,000 cases of a<br>tumor why is that impossible because it<br>illustrates the value of prospective<br>databases and you're just in the process<br>nationwide as I understand it beginning<br>to invest in big data management in the<br>medical profession we began that in the<br>early 1980s the other great attraction<br>we didn't even know when we began we<br>didn't even know when began to bank<br>tissue putting it in a freezer that<br>subsequently we would have all these<br>genetic analysis which would be<br>correlated to databases that are now 30<br>years out and mature I don't need to<br>what I want to demonstrate is that the<br>databases actually provide knowledge<br>based care and the future of cancer care<br>is not about whether I'm a surgeon or<br>radiation therapist it's about the<br>knowledge of the disease and that's<br>sometimes hard to get across the<br>surgeons hopefully not to you but if you<br>look at these databases we can show<br>things it's man and woman get the same<br>we can show where the tumor goes we can<br>show what kind of thought but if you<br>examine outcome just of a database<br>without any interference<br>it actually can tell you about how the<br>treatment might be designed<br>let me slowly illustrate this so here<br>sorry so here are patients I've just<br>taken local disease the person who gets<br>a local recurrence the tumor comes back<br>at the local site and if you look at the<br>Purple Line that happens to be what we<br>call visceral tumors 2000 cases and here<br>is another different entity what we call<br>retroperitoneal and they're clearly the<br>likelihood of local recurrence is very<br>different now when I was a medical<br>student I was told that if you got out<br>to five years you're cured but look at<br>this disease it never quite goes away so<br>we immediately<br>recognize that five-year survival is a<br>relative event but more importantly this<br>tells us if we now look not at local<br>recurrence but who dies disease-specific<br>survival who dies of this disease well<br>suddenly the the purple tumor is down<br>here remember the local recurrence of<br>the purple was up here and the red line<br>is pretty much the same so what that<br>tells us immediately these people must<br>die of metastatic disease spread<br>elsewhere and these people must die of<br>their local tumor it's no point in<br>giving intravenous chemotherapy if for<br>the local recurrence and there's every<br>reason to give systemic overall<br>treatment for those who die and all<br>we've done is record the data so I'm<br>very much encouraged by this<br>governmental design you have to invest<br>in Big Data<br>now we began this 30 years ago but the<br>opportunity to learn things whether it's<br>by any form of analysis but big data<br>mining is is here is coming that just<br>says the histology but what it also<br>tells us is I can just look at the site<br>and tell you what's the likelihood of a<br>particular histology and that will<br>change how I treat people that if I look<br>at that I can look without anything else<br>just looking at the grade which is the<br>degree of aggressiveness of the tumor<br>and the size of the tumor something<br>that's available before an operation and<br>say well if you have a high-grade tumor<br>your chance of dying of the disease is<br>40% you have a low-grade tumor not a<br>very sophisticated observation look down<br>the microscope say looks bad look down<br>the microscope doesn't look bad but the<br>fact that matter it translates into an<br>extraordinary difference you don't want<br>this patient to receive essentially any<br>treatment but you want this patient<br>particularly if they're sitting down<br>here to receive some form of treatment<br>and all we've done is write down their<br>records we haven't done anything<br>different we haven't intervened<br>doesn't matter the other thing that that<br>says is that a local recurrence<br>something that comes back at the site<br>where the tumor is moved is not<br>necessarily the cause of the metastasis<br>because think about this disease if a<br>local recurrence of a tumor that occurs<br>in your leg or your arm is the cause of<br>your death then I take off your arm you<br>can't recur you can't die and we know<br>that's not true<br>and so that changed how we began in the<br>nineteen seventy five every patient I<br>saw who had a sarcoma of the limb lost a<br>limb they had an amputation a morbid<br>amputation often losing that bone<br>everything but the fact of the matter is<br>the local recurrence was not the cause<br>of the recurrence we have to get over<br>that concept now that just says the same<br>thing these variables that we can see<br>are not independent they come together<br>so we have to think again in a data<br>mining sense how do we put these<br>conflicting events together and that<br>says the same thing I realized that time<br>the other thing we've learned is that<br>these are recurrences how how does a<br>tumor<br>get a metastasis well if it's an<br>aggressive lesion a high-grade lesion<br>then the majority occur 50% recurrence<br>within the first five years so the way<br>in which we look at these tumors is very<br>aggressive follow-up here but these who<br>go on and at 20 years are stilling<br>having some recurrence we don't look at<br>them so aggressively but we never stop<br>looking at them and all I've done is<br>written down the data<br>I haven't interfered or done anything as<br>yet that just says the same thing<br>Molecular diagnosis is when we look at<br>the tumor and we find a gene that<br>describes that tumor this tumor it's<br>called synovial sarcoma I was given that<br>name because when I was growing up it<br>was a tumor that occurred in young<br>people it occurred around<br>joints and it was said to come from the<br>lining of the joint we now for sure it<br>has nothing to do with the lining of the<br>joint but until we had a genetic<br>signature which it happens to be it<br>doesn't really matter it's a fusion gene<br>it's two genes coming together we<br>wouldn't have made the diagnosis but<br>because in 99 percent of these they<br>express one of these fusion genes we now<br>make the diagnosis completely<br>differently and what that means is I<br>excuse me what it means is I was taught<br>it was always a disease of young people<br>but now we know because of that genetic<br>signature<br>it can occur throughout lifetime<br>something we never would have done<br>without that signature and the same<br>thing well I was told you're not only<br>occurs in the extremities but you can<br>see it because everywhere and in fact<br>we've seen it in places like the nasal<br>cavity or the product or the brain so a<br>genetic signature allows you to make the<br>distinction and that's the future<br>genetic signatures for most most tumors<br>oh that just says the same thing the the<br>pattern of metastases where the tumor<br>goes will actually tell you how to treat<br>them haven't done anything if the tumor<br>has a propensity to go to a lymph nodes<br>then removal the lymph nodes may be<br>valuable but if in fact as in sarcoma it<br>really goes to lymph nodes then what I<br>was taught take out the lymph nodes<br>makes no sense and we now know that and<br>that just says the same thing the other<br>thing that we know of course is that the<br>site of metastasis where the tumor goes<br>if you know that then that guides your<br>investigation if the tumor is in the<br>extremity almost invariably goes to the<br>lung then it's a chest x-ray or a CT<br>scan if the tumor is a visceral sarcoma<br>which almost always goes initially<br>anyway to the liver then it's an<br>examination of the liver so these ideas<br>of blanket Oh doctor don't I need a PET<br>scan don't I need a whole body scan<br>don't make sense and we can guide that<br>much more carefully I think tomorrow I'm<br>going to talk about what's wrong with<br>the<br>u.s. medical system and one of the<br>things that's wrong just one there are<br>many is that we over investigate and<br>that's expensive and doesn't help the<br>patient the other thing we can do if<br>we've got big datasets which you will<br>begin is we can begin to decide about<br>how people what defines response and how<br>well they'll they'll they will respond<br>we can do lots of different ways the key<br>thing is the first thing is easy how do<br>I look at your tumor and tell you what's<br>going to happen to you and the first<br>thing we did this is just one of our<br>fellows years ago it depends on what you<br>want to know everyone says well I want<br>to know how well I'm going to do or how<br>badly I want to go well what do you want<br>to know do you want to know whether<br>you're going to recur with the local<br>recurrence or do you want to know if<br>you're going to die of the disease very<br>different observations and they're<br>intriguing it's no surprise you're going<br>to get the tumor come back in the same<br>place if you leave some behind or you<br>already had one previously that's easy<br>but if I'm gonna die of the disease what<br>I told you aggressive tumors causes your<br>death but how is it that the original<br>tumor with a positive margin let<br>microscopic disease behind is a cause of<br>event or a certainly associated event<br>with a disease specific survivor death<br>or disease that has to be biology it<br>can't be any other answer it's not a<br>failure of the surgeon because I can get<br>rid of this if it's in your leg I take<br>off your leg but if you're still gonna<br>recur then that's of no value the other<br>thing we can do is and you'll see more<br>and more to there is is to actually take<br>these mathematical models and this has<br>helped me a great deal actually take<br>factors that we wouldn't have thought<br>made a difference put them into a model<br>and actually predict not just how you<br>will do as a group but how well as I do<br>as an individual patient this describes<br>what we do but basically it's a tool<br>that says I want to be able to say that<br>the predicted outcome here is the same<br>as the observed outcome and if this is a<br>straight line that's a good nomogram<br>that's a good model then all we have to<br>worry about<br>let's make this tighter and tighter so<br>it's an extra model and we've done that<br>in multiple diseases in our own<br>institution and what it does say it says<br>for a patient for a hundred patients<br>exactly like you we would expect X plus<br>y to recur that's not like saying you're<br>in a bad stage of tumour that's about<br>saying what's going to happen to you and<br>as long as this plus y the variance is<br>small that's a powerful predictor for<br>the individual patient who's sitting in<br>your office and we've spent a lot of<br>time doing that that says the same thing<br>we've validated the other thing you can<br>do you can take these nomograms these<br>predictive models and make them whereas<br>my tumor it's a lung cancer is it a<br>specific histology how will I do is it<br>time Alton doctor I took out my stomach<br>a year ago for a cancer of the stomach<br>how am i doing how am I going to do<br>cynical answer is you're here today so<br>you're going to do a lot better than if<br>you weren't here today but you're not<br>allowed to say that but you can then say<br>has my survival been altered and the<br>answer is of course but more importantly<br>you can say how much has it been altered<br>if my risk of dying was 90% two years<br>ago and I'm here today what is it now<br>well it might in fact be 30% a very<br>powerful at all again emphasizing this<br>data management now we have a big<br>problem in the United States because<br>this we can't possibly afford the health<br>care that we're providing so how are we<br>going to fix that these are some of the<br>things the one I want to talk about<br>briefly now briefly is self critique<br>because I've been critical of others<br>I've said others have made lets<br>criticize some of the things I've done<br>now I did what's called a randomized<br>trial<br>I took a P book group of people that had<br>this sarcoma and I randomized them in<br>the operating room flip of a coin you<br>get radiation or you don't and I was<br>delighted to know that I made a<br>difference in terms of local recurrence<br>now about a 20% difference and I've<br>followed these patients out 10 and 15<br>years it's sustained<br>so I congratulated myself I done made a<br>difference but then I looked at what<br>happened to survival there's no benefit<br>to survival<br>so that says the same thing as I said<br>before if local recurrence was going to<br>kill you then take off your leg take off<br>your arm and you won't recur but it<br>doesn't so that made me think about<br>something that I should do that I really<br>began my career only interested in the<br>benefit and most doctors do that we want<br>to make a difference you want to help<br>people but the fact of the matter is<br>none of these treatments and the details<br>don't matter for the non physicians are<br>without some risk<br>there's no intervention that is without<br>risk even doing nothing is not without<br>risk and people get complications from<br>these disease and what it says is that<br>when you read trials the number one<br>grade one evidence is a randomized trial<br>but they only apply to the people in the<br>trial and we don't seem to be able to<br>get over the fact that we do a trial and<br>we tell you this works does it work for<br>me would I have been in the trial and<br>I'll illustrate that very simply we<br>looked at this trial I told you that we<br>have the local recurrence rate but I<br>looked at all the people that could have<br>got into my trial but didn't and in fact<br>their local recurrence was exactly if if<br>we treated so these people must have had<br>a much greater risk but into the trial<br>and we never talked about that so I<br>began to think about how do I change<br>that how do I think differently and I<br>thought about this idea doesn't matter<br>what the trial is but we've got a trial<br>and this is one of you are sitting on<br>here and you were never going to recur<br>or die or anything and so you could not<br>benefit from anything you weren't going<br>to recur anyway these people up here got<br>a benefit from it but the people above<br>the line they died or they recurred<br>doesn't matter so they didn't benefit<br>these people couldn't benefit because<br>nothing was going to happen so it all<br>came down to how big is this difference<br>how significant is that<br>what does it mean to have deathly<br>majority it's not the benefit but the<br>consequences cuz everybody gets side<br>effects so let's just walk through again<br>a little mathematics doesn't matter what<br>the trial is it's my trial so I'm able<br>to criticize it so 70 percent didn't<br>recur they only got the side effects 10<br>percent got the side effects and they<br>recurred so it's this 20% in the middle<br>is the only thing that matters and we've<br>got a trial it works and we say standard<br>of care so that means a hundred percent<br>of people going to get it knowing that<br>eighty percent could not benefit either<br>because they don't respond or they get<br>only the side effects the whole idea of<br>informed consent do we talk to patients<br>like this we say we are sure that we<br>have an intervention that will improve<br>your survival by 20% that's what we say<br>we don't say we have an intervention in<br>which there is an 80% chance it will<br>make no difference because 70% of you<br>don't need it and 10% won't benefit<br>that's not what doctors do and if you<br>think about it it's not what I did I do<br>now but I didn't then if you make those<br>numbers very small 90% of woman with<br>early stage breast cancer will never<br>occur but we know with an intervention<br>we can get that to 92 or 93 we say<br>unequivocally we can improve your<br>survival it's true<br>what we don't say is for anyone of you<br>to benefit 49 have to be treated<br>we don't talk like that and that's what<br>we need to begin to do that's one of the<br>things that's wrong with our system 20%<br>benefit may not be so great it sounds<br>great it's what I want but if you take<br>people who have already got metastatic<br>disease to a particular organ that 20%<br>of benefit not my data may in fact be a<br>survival benefit that's measured in a<br>month is that valuable well it might be<br>but we don't talk about it net that<br>sense this is one of my favorite slides<br>this is a very good journal peer<br>ujong very respected author and he<br>remember in the US you have to do a<br>randomized trial to get the drug<br>approved so that the FDA will pay for it<br>and then if your Medicare Medicare's not<br>now allowed to negotiate they must give<br>it to you so all that the drug company<br>wants is that this p-value is real that<br>it's significant but walk through it a<br>little carefully it's measured in months<br>now this is advanced pancreatic cancer<br>bad disease I've spent a lot of time<br>like six point two four months now why<br>would you describe survival as two<br>decimal places of a month one decimal<br>place of a month is three days as I<br>understand it two decimal places is<br>seven hours I know I can have a positive<br>trial I will just delay the CT scan by a<br>week and my trial will be positive and<br>doctormick nights will be negative and<br>yet this is what we do it's not that<br>we're telling lies that we're just that<br>we're not being honest we're not<br>interpreting the day and this is the<br>same thing now we've got a problem we're<br>measuring survival in weeks<br>sorry that's and we measured it in<br>decimal places randomised trial<br>seven point three versus eight<br>incredible significance but it's all due<br>to the high numbers that wouldn't happen<br>if there was twenty and either group<br>would it and we don't that's not how we<br>describe it so having been incredibly<br>critical let me describe the good news<br>the solution is we've been focusing on<br>the wrong end of the curve now we didn't<br>know that we set out to make a<br>difference I wanted to make a difference<br>but now we have the tools to focus not<br>on this end of the curve but to focus on<br>this end of the curve we now have tools<br>to predict who isn't gonna recur or who<br>is going to occur so he can make better<br>judgments and I can spend a long time<br>talking about that but there's lots of<br>ways we can talk about predictive<br>variables based on risk we can talk<br>about nomograms we can talk about<br>genetic signatures this is an example<br>this is a randomized trial of a<br>particular drug that works for a<br>particular tumor who has a particular<br>mutation<br>but then we look at the mutation and<br>within that mutation there's only one<br>variation of that mutation that responds<br>and yet in our community if you had this<br>gastrointestinal stromal tumor it's<br>called if you went to the doctor in the<br>u.s. you would get this drug if you came<br>to our place you'd have mutational<br>analysis and you'd only get it if you<br>had the mutation we know it's going to<br>respond and that's the future we just<br>published the institution not me the<br>analysis of 10,000 cancer patients in<br>the last eight months with a gene<br>signature of 480 genes identifying<br>targets that we never knew existed<br>before that's the future that's<br>beginning to be starting back here and<br>there's lots of other ways we can do<br>that we can use a PET scan that says at<br>the start here you've got a very active<br>tumor it takes up glucose we treat you<br>and if it one month that take up of<br>glucose hasn't halved you will not<br>respond to that regimen stop change<br>different direction so we have lots of<br>lots of ways to approach it looks like<br>I'm in time so what's happened well I<br>started out I'm a surgeon<br>discipline-specific you have a tumor I'm<br>a surgeon I can take it out then began<br>to say well wait a minute<br>maybe it's organ specific maybe we<br>should only focus that on the colon<br>cancer then it became disease specific I<br>want to understand your disease and then<br>it is and you've got a molecular<br>signature but even beyond that now<br>you've got a pathway that drives you<br>tuna not just the signature not just the<br>accelerator but the combination of the<br>accelerator and the brake and that's<br>really where modern cancer care is it's<br>between the accelerator and the brake<br>we're not in the main where you can turn<br>the switch off the engines still running<br>but you're not going anywhere and so<br>instead of dying your cancer you're<br>living with cancer and that in the short<br>term will be the future this just says<br>the same thing in genetic signature<br>because what it says is that now we may<br>treat a person who has a lung cancer and<br>a person who has a head and neck cancer<br>or an ovarian cancer and because the a'<br>signature is the same they treated the<br>same way<br>as opposed to what we did historically<br>so I think that's probably all we need<br>to say I think just to complete the<br>evening first first of all I'd like you<br>just to show your appreciation to<br>summary once again and and I would just<br>would like to introduce dr. Phillip Bari<br>who is the son of John Bari summary I'd<br>like to thank you for a fascinating and<br>enlightening address on the evolution of<br>cancer care it's a tremendous honor for<br>the Otago medical school and for the<br>basic medical sciences Trust to have<br>such an illustrious person to be the<br>inaugural John Barry prophet<br>professorial fellow our family are<br>honored to have you here and we are very<br>moved by what those behind the trust<br>have done for our father in particular<br>I'd like to thank dr. Jim Reed who's<br>done the tremendous amount of work to<br>set this up mr. Richard Banton and also<br>to Sofia Mackay who's organized this<br>function tonight a huge amount of work<br>thank you there it was passionate about<br>his clinical practice research and<br>teaching from the mid 50s through to the<br>early 70s he carried out significant<br>surgical research using sheep to do hard<br>grab a heart valve allografts tracheal<br>restrictions with celesta chem plants<br>along with early work around lung<br>transplantation I couldn't remember on<br>occasions when we went to our family<br>retreat at weight Eddie there would be<br>one such surgical sheep that had<br>survived and it would be in the back of<br>our station wagon to be taken out to the<br>beach society who field and then<br>sometime later maybe six months or a<br>year later Michael Lewis and I was sent<br>out to count the number of sheep that<br>were there and report back to dead dead<br>always believed that you should look to<br>the future and embrace change marry your<br>eloquent address tonight demonstrates<br>the extensive change in cancer care has<br>just shown us something of the tip of<br>the iceberg as to where we're heading<br>and it's I think it's just amazing I'd<br>like to take you back briefly to 1899<br>and give you a brief insight into the<br>change in general practice over the past<br>century my grandfather William Henry<br>burry entered the otago Medical School<br>in 1889 three years later he sailed to<br>Edinburgh to complete his training in<br>1894 he returned to New Zealand in 1899<br>with the intention of setting up general<br>practice in Dunedin the general<br>practitioner in Port Charles at the time<br>dr. Cunningham died unexpectedly and<br>William Henry agreed to do a six-month<br>locum 26 years later he in 1925 he moved<br>to Dunedin to set up general practice at<br>age 54 I would like to read just a brief<br>2-minute extract from growl you may go<br>you must which includes 40 brief<br>histories of early New Zealand doctors<br>nurses and patients poor Chalmers at the<br>time was a very busy port but the<br>medical practice extended far beyond the<br>limits of the town to the north west to<br>the Camargue to the northeast arrow<br>Marana and then on the peninsula from<br>larnice castle down the Otago hits in<br>his house there was no radio it was not<br>even thought of then nor any<br>walkie-talkie to conserve effort just<br>three telephones downstairs in the hall<br>the first was the general telephone<br>complete with handles and batteries<br>number 10 for charmers<br>the second was a party lined for night<br>calls and the third was a direct line to<br>the poor charmers stables when the phone<br>went at night<br>my grandfather instantly awoke his call<br>was too long rings if it rang three he<br>would Cyrus relief and be asleep before<br>the seven long rings of the harbor board<br>had finished sounding but if he went<br>downstairs to answer the telephone<br>my grandmother listening and beard would<br>know by the prepositions he used just<br>where he was summoned if he said I'll<br>come down she knew it was to Deborah Bay<br>or beyond if it was I'll come out<br>she knew it was to Sawyer's bay or up to<br>cent Leonard's or Burke's if he said<br>I'll come round let me into near trip to<br>Port Charles Peninsula or Carey's Bay if<br>he said I'll come over<br>she knew that meant an all-night ride<br>over the hills to ytt or I'll come<br>across he had to make the crossing to<br>Portobello in an open boat with the<br>prospect of a grim ride to broad bay<br>Sandymount<br>or even cape saunders hit then ring<br>portabello on the night phone and she<br>would hear is that you boy can you come<br>over by launch for me but if the weather<br>was rough he would have to bring the SS<br>tearaway and most likely arouse the<br>engineer took as well to share the trip<br>for calls on the poor charmers side of<br>his practice he then rang a third<br>telephone direct to the stables is that<br>you mrs. Stevenson tell Asher to saddle<br>the horse I'll be down in a few minutes<br>having read that I can now understand<br>why my father was so keen to embrace<br>change the name Marie Brennan was<br>mentioned in the house from time to time<br>more recently and in recent years when<br>dared reminisce about people he admit<br>and taught at the Otago medical school<br>Murray he was so proud of you and<br>delighted to see that the Keene Yankee<br>we had scaled the heights of the<br>american medical system<br>he knew the determination the dedication<br>commitment and the sacrifice that you<br>gave to achieve what you've done I'd<br>like everyone to join with me in<br>thinking summary</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
