China is<br>likely to be the biggest economic<br>superpower in the coming decade so for<br>me to be able to put myself in a place<br>like China was absolutely phenomenal.<br>During my time in China I interned at a<br>company called Encompass<br>Procurement. Our base was out of a city called<br>Xiamen on the southeast coast of the Fujian province. The company I worked for<br>Encompass Procurement specialices in<br>organising international logistics and<br>distribution solutions. The project that I<br>worked on while I was in China was<br>developing a world first home automated <br>product that's involved doing a lot of<br>research on different factories the<br>capabilities and able to meet the<br>requirements that we're looking for. My<br>time in China was a very eye-opening<br>experience. Food that they have over<br>there is very much not like our own here in<br>New Zealand. Cultural norms, consumer<br>behaviour, the way they operate and live is so<br>distinctly different to what we have<br>here in New Zealand. After I graduate from<br>my Management Degree I'm hoping to work in a corporation and then going from<br>there to embrace my passion for<br>entrepreneurship and innovation; getting<br>involved in a sustainability start-up. I<br>feel a lot more confident than jumping<br>straight into the business world and<br>taking it head on.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
