students about the career path that led her to her current role.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thanks very much for coming to listen to<br>me today and it's great to be here and I<br>always enjoy talking to people about my<br>experience in the law because I think my<br>story is well it's a funny one because I<br>think it's a bit strange for the<br>Solicitor General to say as I say to<br>many groups and places that I never<br>wanted to be a lawyer and and I was just<br>talking to the Dean before that I think<br>if I had wanted to be the Solicitor<br>General I don't think I would have made<br>it so I feel like I've had a funny old<br>career path to the job which I think<br>surely is one of the most interesting<br>jobs a lawyer can have in this country<br>and it's certainly turning out to be<br>there what I talk about is something of<br>that career path and how I got to where<br>I got to in my role in my life as a<br>public servant and I'm really proud to<br>be a public soon I think it's such an<br>important calling to be a public servant<br>to New Zealand and then I'll talk about<br>my role is listed in all what does it<br>mean what do I do<br>what is the function and I hope we have<br>time for questions I will and you might<br>have to remind me to weave it or maybe<br>I'll weave it in but I will talk to you<br>about the GCSB because that year was one<br>of the most significant years for me yet<br>and what I learned about myself actually<br>not what I learned about the<br>intelligence agencies that will get<br>there so I didn't want to be a lawyer I<br>went to law school and I don't really<br>remember why but probably you know I was<br>no good at making science and I could<br>talk the legs of a table and I was good<br>at debating in English in my family<br>expectation was that I would go to<br>university so all of those things played<br>into sort of pretty obvious calculus do<br>law degree my brother did a law degree<br>too so it made some sense em but I<br>thought what lawyers did when you<br>finished law school was what I saw<br>lawyers on television doing working too<br>hard drinking too much having sex with<br>each other in the office<br>it was sort of like what it seemed to me<br>was the public version of luring the<br>publicly available version of lawyering<br>something I wasn't very interested in<br>and also the idea now maybe that came<br>later but the idea that you work for<br>somebody else's bottom line not<br>if I had that quite so clearly as a<br>young person that I didn't want to do<br>this but anyway so I finished law school<br>and I went around all the morphine's in<br>Wellington looking for a job and<br>unsurprisingly they didn't want me and I<br>didn't want them back and that was<br>probably obviousl interview so that was<br>like who didn't give any of those jobs I<br>don't think I would have thrived and the<br>private sector firm but we never know or<br>maybe it's not too late never say never<br>am I think I would do differently now<br>but anyway one of my friends said of<br>this agency of public service agencies<br>recruiting why don't you go and see them<br>so I went along the Ministry of Consumer<br>Affairs and got a job and my job then<br>was to answer the telephone and our 800<br>numbers they still exist toll-free phone<br>calls to my desk in a few others of us<br>from people who had consumer problems<br>you didn't have to be a lawyer to do<br>this job but it was a bit like Citizens<br>Advice bureaux sort of Zeiss line that<br>government used to run it and we used to<br>do some great things in that job people<br>who needed help who didn't know how to<br>get help who didn't understand the law<br>who didn't understand they're being<br>ripped off and buying rubbish cars on<br>punishing hire-purchase in illegal<br>credit deals and I really enjoyed that<br>work and I realised that my lawyer and<br>could actually do something useful and I<br>didn't have to be like the lawyers that<br>I saw on television but actually I was<br>something else I was really helping and<br>it gave me a great buzz to help<br>individuals in that way also I had some<br>very dreary times and their job one of<br>my sort of famous or and maybe famously<br>recorded or recounted stories is that I<br>had a phone call from a woman who said<br>I've got a complaint yes my husband and<br>I counting the matches and a box of<br>matches hmm having a good day and and<br>they're only 49 in the box but the box<br>is aprox 40 I thought hmmm I wonder if I<br>should be doing something different with<br>my law degree<br>but I knew that I was really enjoying<br>other aspects of this helping these<br>people that needed help and I moved over<br>into the policy function of my agency of<br>Consumer Affairs and that was realized<br>that when I realize that actually being<br>involved in how government makes rules<br>to help everybody and I didn't just have<br>to do this one on one thing I could be<br>involved in law reform in a way that<br>meant that I felt like I was doing<br>something good kind of like for the<br>community or for the society involved in<br>Consumer Affairs so a consumer law<br>reform hire-purchase reform and I think<br>that's when I came across you may and<br>hire-purchase law reform in fact I<br>remember may finding my approach to the<br>Official Information Act refreshing<br>because she would ring me up and ask me<br>for something and I would send it to her<br>and it's always been my approach the<br>Official Information Act that's how it<br>should work but then anyway it gets<br>complicated sometimes so that was a<br>really great experience and also the<br>experience of some only three or four<br>years out of law school being in the<br>House of Representatives sitting with<br>the minister we'll just before the line<br>with the Minister sits above the line<br>you sit below it but anyway when he in<br>that case he was in the chair leading<br>this legislation through the house and<br>in questions would come up or proposals<br>for amendment would be made on the floor<br>of the house and the minister would turn<br>to you the lawyer for assistance that<br>can we do that how can we do that you'd<br>scary often talk to the drafters we were<br>making law like really in the moment it<br>was really exciting and in a very<br>exciting new idea for me that's what<br>lawyers could do probably after a couple<br>of years maybe not two years and in that<br>job I thought no do I want to be a<br>policy advisor or do I want to be a<br>lawyer proper like I still had this idea<br>that there was a proper lawyer that you<br>might be so I applied for job at the<br>Ministry of Fisheries and got that as a<br>solicitor and that was boy working in<br>fisheries was fantastic it was so<br>interesting again you know I was<br>involved and of course fisheries<br>Laurence's the animal husbandry<br>regulatory framework around fishing but<br>also treaty settlements also devolution<br>of<br>fishing there who non-commercial fishing<br>rights to ie and drafting up the<br>regulatory framework that would support<br>that it was really a huge range of<br>things that we did you know an agency<br>that you might have thought was a bit<br>narrow fisheries but a couple of things<br>also started to happen to me when I was<br>at Consumer Affairs I was asked to<br>manage a small team and then as asked to<br>manage a slightly larger team one of the<br>fisheries I came in not as a manager and<br>then was soon asked to manage the legal<br>team and I also realized that I had<br>something of a propensity for managing<br>people and process and I quite like that<br>too so now I'm collecting up sort of<br>ideas that I can be a lawyer the thing<br>that I thought was a lawyer is wrong and<br>I can be a lawyer in my own way as a<br>manager of people of a legal adviser as<br>I was when I started to watch in those<br>days fisheries was highly contested its<br>fishing quota was allocated based on<br>fishing history and it was all very<br>contested there's a lot of litigation<br>and I used to go along and sit in the<br>back of the courtroom and watch clown<br>law lawyers represent the Ministry of<br>Fisheries and judicial reviews mostly<br>and that started to key into my old<br>habit of drama and acting that I'd done<br>all through school and I thought that<br>looks pretty cool because he's meeting<br>can item you know could I do that I<br>wasn't sure that I could but I was<br>applied for job I got a job at the<br>Ministry of sorry at the Krannert office<br>in 2002 as a Crown Counsel and I thought<br>right stop this management business you<br>know be a proper where and stop getting<br>involved in management which takes you<br>away from lawyering and sure enough soon<br>I was asked to manage a small team at<br>Crown Law and I finally stopped<br>resisting that part of my skill set<br>which was about dealing with people and<br>I should welcome to announce you might<br>forget I think one of the critical<br>things about lawyering is that you need<br>to be good with people to be an<br>effective lawyer you need to be able to<br>be clear to somebody you're talking to<br>you need to get or work some they need<br>to see that you can understand their<br>context that you can understand their<br>business priorities or their risk<br>tolerances if you are only good with<br>books you might not be so good with<br>people and that as a school you should<br>think about working on and developing<br>in my view that makes you an effective<br>lawyer when you're good of people so I<br>stopped resisting this idea that I was<br>good of people in flung myself at also<br>management roles so became a team leader<br>in Crown Law and the Deputy Solicitor<br>General it was about then that I started<br>to think well if I want me to do I think<br>was before I became the deputy I started<br>to be sort of clear about this until now<br>I hadn't really thought I want to do<br>this then this in there I had just done<br>jobs that I thought were interesting and<br>I thought I wanted to be challenged in<br>my jobs I didn't really particularly<br>care where I ended up my interest was<br>and perhaps in a slightly shallow way<br>having a good life where I did something<br>that I thought was valuable and<br>important and I never wanted to give up<br>my whole life to my work so a couple of<br>sort of strong values for me and that<br>lead me to take different roles but at<br>clam noir I thought maybe I could be the<br>Deputy Solicitor General I started to<br>think in a career planning way and the<br>deputy then was Matthew Palmer now<br>justice Palmer and he was a great mentor<br>to me about helping me be a bit more<br>structured about thinking about what did<br>I want what I want to do and then what<br>gets much I have that I needed to fill<br>and so he he was very good to me about<br>making these kind of work through a<br>process of thinking was it leadership<br>wasn't management was it different law<br>what about the private sector did I want<br>to think about that and anyway I became<br>the deputy assist you know after after<br>process at some point in there I thought<br>well as Helene replies if I wonder aim<br>to be the deputy why not aim to be the<br>Solicitor General and even now I feel<br>like that's slightly embarrassing that I<br>thought that because certainly then I<br>thought that I shouldn't tell anybody<br>else that because they would think we<br>know what sort of a dick he to you that<br>you think that you can become the<br>Solicitor General so I keep it really<br>quiet for a long long time and it was<br>part of my own kind of lessons about<br>myself that needed some courage for<br>myself to say I'm going to try for that<br>in my I set my sights at thinking one<br>day I want to be a credible applicant I<br>want to be an applicant who doesn't get<br>laughed off the page when she applies<br>for that job and it was sort of how high<br>I set my standard then<br>so Mike Heron was the Solicitor General<br>harmonized the deputy his master here in<br>Auckland QC here not canal and he was<br>another great mentor to me about helping<br>me kind of undo this crazy view that I<br>had of myself that I wasn't capable of<br>doing what he was doing and and he was<br>very very good and very generous with<br>his time and we cooked up this plan<br>together that I needed to find a way to<br>go out and do something different and<br>I've come up through public services<br>you've just heard I've been at Crown or<br>since 2002 everybody was telling me well<br>not everybody but the public service<br>kind of Center the state services<br>commission the leadership development<br>programs that I was doing was saying you<br>need to do something else to show us<br>that you're capable of something a bit<br>more broad because people often think<br>that lawyers have a very narrow skill<br>set absolutely wrong but that can be of<br>you especially if you have just come up<br>in a certain line of lawyering<br>so Mike and I came up with a plan that I<br>would look for an opportunity to show<br>that I had a bigger skill set and I went<br>along of course a common opportunity<br>came up we're the deep EMC Department of<br>Prime Minister and cabinet who has an<br>intelligence function and wanted<br>somebody say they want to senior public<br>servant to work with the intelligence<br>agencies to determine what the<br>intelligence agencies might strive for<br>if they wanted to be an agile joined-up<br>intelligence community then what is the<br>sort of a think piece I thought well I<br>can do that and it has a few things for<br>me senior public service to Center role<br>being exposed to a wider range of senior<br>public servants showing I can do<br>something other than lawyering best of<br>all it was an 8 week gig and I really<br>liked my job as deputy Solicitor General<br>and I didn't really want to do this<br>thing to show I had briefs I thought I<br>have got Brits and I don't I like it<br>here I don't want to go and do something<br>different so 8 weeks was retracted so I<br>went ended that piece of work<br>it was great what's really interesting I<br>wasn't being a lawyer I realized I had<br>other skills it was great best of all<br>eight weeks passed and I was heading<br>back to the Deputy Solicitor General<br>role when somebody said to me the<br>director of the<br>his b-roll has just become vacant and<br>we're looking for a short-term secondi<br>are you interested and I thought at the<br>time I should say that I was interested<br>because even though I wasn't interested<br>I thought it was a good opportunity to<br>say I have nobody no sensible and power<br>watches this video but anyway I thought<br>I should say in a show willing like I am<br>yeah okay I'm interested so I see I was<br>interested and I was very shocked and<br>slightly horrified when it came down to<br>you sooner could you please be the Jew<br>to the GCSB what was I thinking thought<br>I I you know I'm a lawyer I don't know<br>what was I thinking I was very anxious<br>and I won't bore you about that with one<br>of my lessons is that if you have this<br>internal narrative and you should listen<br>to it that tells you that you are not<br>good enough or that you're not able to<br>do this or that somebody else should do<br>that because you might mock it up ignore<br>it if you can you know like I am a<br>confident person and I've always been a<br>competent person it took me I was about<br>46 in that job in that year to realize<br>that I also had a really unhealthy<br>internal narrative that was telling me I<br>wasn't capable of stuff when I said<br>being in the bureau was the biggest year<br>of my life<br>it was realizing that so go along to the<br>bureau<br>I'm incredibly anxious just anxiety and<br>sort of worrying about whether I was<br>going to be any good it was all very<br>well to now have a good where I was<br>going to show through what I've capable<br>of but you know like the opposite was<br>possible to write that that this was<br>going to be the end of my career and I<br>would really mock things up and and I<br>had just been on a course I think it was<br>called leading for strategic success and<br>it was a really great course and it<br>revealed one thing to me<br>what revealed few things to me the one<br>thing that really revealed to me was<br>that my approach to life was that if I<br>didn't know what was happening if I<br>didn't know what was coming next I<br>didn't like it I felt nervous and<br>anxious about not knowing what came next<br>and as they often do in these courses<br>they got me to write to myself we all<br>had to write to ourselves that what is<br>the revelation that you've had and what<br>is the thing you're going to do<br>differently and three months later they<br>send it to you and it just so happened<br>that my letter arrived the day before I<br>started at the Bureau and I was such a<br>relief to read and my own hand right<br>but I had learned the symbolism I had<br>forgotten it of course instantly and all<br>the fuss and anxiety that are you're<br>worried because you don't know what's<br>going to happen just don't worry about<br>it and for some reason that just made me<br>actually calm enough I went in the first<br>week in that job whole lot of new Edward<br>Snowden revelations came out in the<br>media I ok good oh but you know I know<br>about preparing for litigation I know<br>how to prepare to front what I had to do<br>my second week which was appear in front<br>of a select committee in a public<br>hearing about what the hell is going on<br>in the bureau so it was a real baptism<br>of fire and I learned that I had to rely<br>on my skills that I had some that I<br>wasn't just a lawyer actually I was also<br>eloquent of persuasive I was smart I was<br>tough you know I learned all these<br>things about myself in that year and to<br>answer the person's question about what<br>else that I learned in the bureau what I<br>learned was the Bureau is sort of really<br>dedicated public servants who work for<br>the government like any other public<br>servant and just because we can't always<br>see what goes on below the radar they're<br>working to government priorities they're<br>accorded working according to law and<br>the oversight that the bureau and the<br>SAS have over them was then and is now<br>more so stronger than any other public<br>servant they've got the Ombudsman the<br>Privacy Commissioner the Auditor General<br>like everybody else the courts like<br>everybody else they've also got the<br>Inspector General of intelligence and<br>security who has complete power to come<br>and look at anything ask for anything I<br>think that has actually just been<br>increased in the new legislation with<br>I'm not as familiar with it and you know<br>she would she had the pass to the<br>building and she would she could indeed<br>walk into anything at any time and you<br>know that doesn't always mean she can't<br>see everything but actually just like<br>heaven and awareness that a judge is<br>looking over your shoulder when you're<br>an administrative decision maker<br>thinking about how do I do things<br>having the Inspector General on the<br>other shoulder it was a really good<br>discipline and so what I learnt was that<br>what we needed to do about those<br>agencies was talk to people I spent most<br>that year out you know in another in a<br>different advocacy roles the one I'm<br>used to talking to people regular people<br>to UM to flick you know he's going on<br>the radio going on the television<br>talking<br>what does the agency do that I can tell<br>you you have to trust us that this stuff<br>you can't see but the Inspector General<br>can see it and the Select Committee of<br>Parliament can see it ministers and the<br>Prime Minister see it an authorised<br>through a warranting process you should<br>trust that process the other thing I<br>learned deal was that I was a really<br>good leader and admit mainly anyway we<br>door was a surprise to enough I don't<br>know but I ended up in a job for a year<br>was supposed to be for two months I<br>ended up just on a year running an<br>organization where I pretty much knew<br>nothing about the subject matter and you<br>know I had ceded my job interview for<br>that temporary role that I did know<br>something about the Bureau which I did I<br>had been a lawyer for the bureau and he<br>says-- before but was only when I got<br>there that I realized who I actually<br>know nothing about what goes on here and<br>and so what my job was was to lead<br>people was to make sure that the right<br>people were making the right decisions<br>the right advice to me if I had to make<br>a decision and so on another point about<br>that agency was that the Snowden<br>revelations spying on Kim calm and<br>lawfully those had been huge hits to<br>their agencies kind of sense of its own<br>place in the world and in the SAS had<br>always been under the radar and you know<br>and they liked it that way and that the<br>cultural change of coming out into the<br>open in a way they'd never been before<br>was a really uncomfortable thing for<br>lots of those intelligence practitioners<br>and so I thought that it was part of my<br>function to really push that helping<br>them see that openness was a was of<br>strength in helping the community see as<br>much as they could in event was a<br>strength for us so that's what I learnt<br>from the Bureau when then Michael here<br>and you know couple of times in my<br>career none answered not very helpful<br>curry advice black played a part and and<br>I don't say that in a disrespectful way<br>to myself because I worked hard and you<br>know I'm here because I'm the right<br>person to be here now but going into the<br>Bureau it happened that the director<br>left out of sort of sequence so the<br>system wasn't really was the new sort of<br>set of people to consider and I was<br>lucky to be really at a place in time<br>with a career<br>development plan that said do something<br>different so career plans can be useful<br>even though I haven't had one thinking<br>about what is it that I might want to do<br>next in those last few years when I've<br>had that that has served me well the<br>other bit of luck was that Michael here<br>and lift slightly also out of sequence<br>so when I was coming to the end of my<br>year and the bureau and thinking what do<br>I do now do I really go back to being<br>the Deputy Solicitor General or do I<br>want to apply for the permanent director<br>of the Bureau role Mike resigned and it<br>was really clear to me Justin how I felt<br>about that that my passion job was the<br>one he had just left I really like my<br>time in the bureau it was a really cool<br>job I actually want that one it was<br>really powerfully clear in me it's a<br>little of stuff about myself all these<br>insights into myself and I felt much<br>better prepared Arthur's people were<br>right all along that I needed a bit of<br>bricks and a bit of distance from what I<br>had done for the last 12 years to kind<br>of really draw out of myself that what I<br>needed to be the first general so I went<br>through that process I hadn't correctly<br>you know don't be anxious I was very<br>anxious nervous and still am from time<br>to talk about what the things they have<br>to do but we'll get to the but that we<br>all know that I was appointed into that<br>role at the beginning of last year and<br>so now if I may in a segue into talking<br>about what that role is all about so<br>with several functions and the Solicitor<br>General so you probably know or maybe<br>don't that the solicitor in the<br>Solicitor General is sometimes called<br>the junior law officer of the crown and<br>the senior law officer of the crown as<br>the Attorney General the Attorney<br>General currently the Honorable<br>Christopher Mason<br>attorney general politician junior law<br>officer public servant in this law<br>office concept is the idea that<br>government successive governments and<br>democracy like ours will always operate<br>according to law and part of their part<br>of governments credibility and<br>legitimacy is that they govern according<br>to law and it is the law offices<br>function to make sure that that happens<br>so<br>subject only to what the attorney says<br>the Solicitor General's view on what the<br>Crown's view of the law is authoritative<br>and determinative as within the crown so<br>to the Solicitor General's view of how<br>the crown needs to behave and argue in<br>the courts I'll come to that advisory<br>role in a minute I'll just run through<br>what the other functions of the law<br>officer are oversight of all<br>prosecutions to the crown of course is<br>the prosecutor of crime through the<br>crown solicitors Network the crown<br>solicitors are private sector lawyers<br>sixteen of them and firms all around the<br>country who act on warrant and under<br>Solicitor General guidelines to conduct<br>a most serious prosecutor most serious<br>crimes so violence murder sexual<br>violence those big tariff crimes the<br>ones that the Crown prosecutor through<br>Crown solicitors also in the Crown<br>Prosecution function are the regulatory<br>crimes if you like public prosecutions<br>so MPI you know fishing breaching<br>fishing rules say or discharging water<br>we shouldn't those sorts of regulatory<br>crimes also done by prosecutors in the<br>solicitor it's actually the Attorney<br>General who constitutionally has that<br>function of oversight responsibility for<br>all prosecution's but because of the<br>fact that that person in our system and<br>has been for the last 180 something<br>years been a politician it tends to get<br>left to the independent public servant<br>there's a couple of things that you<br>might think your intention you know how<br>can a minister who presumably has<br>responsibility collectively for<br>advancing government's policy interests<br>have independent function to be able to<br>say how you can't do that the law says<br>you can't do that or you need to do it<br>in a different way and practice it gets<br>left to the Solicitor General not<br>because I think the attorney any<br>attorney not just the son but not<br>because I think necessarily that they<br>won't be able to think independently and<br>then law officer function but partly<br>because it does it might look like they<br>can't and I think part of our country's<br>constitutional framework so a<br>constitutional credibility is about<br>people you had to see the frameworks and<br>that people can see<br>oh right I don't have to think I can't<br>think New Zealand as a corrupt place or<br>that government is corrupt and just does<br>what it likes and it rides over laws and<br>it doesn't care if they can see the<br>functionaries who are there to say this<br>is what the Lord should be I'm one of<br>those functionaries so it's pretty<br>exciting demanding role for for me and<br>obviously I don't know myself I have a<br>whole office of people who assist me in<br>that and more than that we now operate<br>very much as a network throughout the<br>government lawyer profession being a<br>lawyer and government now more so much<br>more so than when I started will you be<br>will you bid part me into lawyer your<br>loyalty would be to that department and<br>you would be as trying to assist that<br>department achieve what it needed to<br>achieve we are now working in a very<br>much more networks way so that we are<br>making the best use of that some eight<br>hundred lawyers that work in government<br>and core government if you add crown<br>entities about 1200 lawyers and you know<br>the idea that in-house lawyers bring<br>this particular benefit to lawyering<br>which is that they and how to know<br>you're not in a firm you're employed and<br>the business that you're advising and<br>house advantage is that you understand<br>the context you understand that business<br>or agency's objectives you understand<br>what risks they are prepared to take<br>lawfully and you understand what<br>opportunities they'd like to pursue so<br>the Crown's<br>in-house counsel cohort is eight or<br>twelve hundred lawyers and we have to<br>harness that to make sure that the crown<br>through executive government can do what<br>what each individual government wants to<br>achieve but also bears in mind the<br>Crown's long-term interests and<br>obligations and it is critical that we<br>have that wider view that we don't get<br>caught up too readily than transactional<br>arrangements to make sure that yes that<br>can I help you achieve that and I'll<br>help you achieve this you know my<br>brother is a lawyer actually he was just<br>wanted as a high court judge yesterday<br>and he'll be sitting here open from<br>Monday<br>he was a lawyer and and he was telling<br>me one day that when he was in practice<br>he was arguing for a point for a client<br>ex arguing this point he argued the<br>opposite of that same point for a<br>different client you know a few weeks<br>later it just seems so bizarre to me<br>that the crown can never do that even if<br>just using examples even if the Ministry<br>of Primary Industries wants to win this<br>case and it can by arguing that point my<br>function is to make sure that it will<br>not be allowed at that point is not<br>something that serves the Crown's<br>long-term interests and obligations it's<br>quite challenging and this idea that you<br>come I often say to people Crown Law<br>endless lists general where your worst<br>kind of lawyers because you have to come<br>to us on lots of things like since 1950<br>they've been a set of rules called the<br>cabinet directions for the conduct of<br>crown legal business that say certain<br>types of things if a department needs<br>lawyers to help it outside of its own<br>cohort of lawyers it has to come to the<br>Solicitor General and it seems like the<br>criminal law revenue exercise of power<br>most litigation you have to come through<br>the slits general it's not that we do it<br>all ourselves that sets supervisory<br>function it's so important so that we do<br>have this view about the crown and what<br>it's up to and so I say to people where<br>your worst kind of lawyers because you<br>have to come to us on certain things and<br>when you do we might not do what you<br>want us to do because you might say you<br>can't argue that point even though in<br>your moment you might win because either<br>the Crown's already decided the right<br>view of the law is something different<br>or for another long-term reason and we<br>don't think that's right in the best<br>example near slightly relation point I<br>think is easier to explain in the<br>prosecution function now there's this<br>expression that the crown enjoys no<br>victories and suffers no losses and I<br>used to think that we just said that to<br>ourselves to make yourself feel better<br>when we lost a case and certainly we do<br>say that but actually it means something<br>else<br>the Crown's interest is different from<br>any particular individual decision<br>makers immediate interest in the moment<br>take prosecutions for example the<br>function of the prosecutor is not to<br>learn the fact<br>the prosecutor is not to get a<br>conviction the function of the<br>prosecutor for the crown is to make sure<br>that trials are fairly held and<br>conducted that defendants have fair<br>process applied to them as they are<br>brought before the court for the court<br>to determine what happens and the<br>application of the criminal law and we<br>do our job well when we recognize that<br>the crown has a particular function<br>there and it is of course we can argue<br>well and forcefully for a particular<br>conviction or a particular outcome we<br>don't have to be supine about it but<br>unlike the defense lawyer his function<br>is to avoid the prosecution for their<br>client our client is and this might<br>sound a little bit knobby actually the<br>people of New Zealand our client is the<br>crown our client is this bigger interest<br>not just the individual agency that's in<br>front of us that's a real you know<br>that's a great thrill what a what a<br>crazy mayor job it is that that is my<br>function but it's also a real burden too<br>and I've said this before and you might<br>have heard me say that I see my job as<br>both a burden and a huge privilege it's<br>a huge privilege to be continuing my<br>public service career in this job which<br>is just absolutely about how does this<br>country continue to have legitimate<br>government and lend us in an obvious<br>constitutional structure that people can<br>trust and it's a burden and that as I've<br>said sometimes we get to say to people<br>young up I disagree and we're not going<br>to argue that point or you can't take<br>that point and as ever how we go about<br>that how we discharge that burden is<br>critical to me anyway in a successful<br>tenure for me as Solicitor General<br>because what I need to be is influential<br>and called upon in a favori day I'm<br>saying to people no you can't in it and<br>though the rule of law says you know you<br>can - - see we're gonna stop calling me<br>and so it's this real tension of being a<br>good practical jobbing lawyer and being<br>able to identify where is the line that<br>I need to make sure that nobody goes<br>past and sort of it's really quite easy<br>to say at you today it's actually really<br>hard to even practice and I'm not sure I<br>will not get it right every time<br>and in some ways the litigation part of<br>that is easier because there is somebody<br>else there who determines what is the<br>meaning of the law of the court of<br>course gets to determine what is the<br>meaning of the law and some ways it's<br>the advisory function that is the real<br>burden because like that old saying and<br>you know you know the real character of<br>a person through by what they do when no<br>one's watching<br>I think the real strength of the of my<br>what's the word of my allegiance to the<br>rule of law is what we advise and how we<br>can achieve rule of law compliant<br>decisions based successive governments<br>and when no one challenges it maybe no<br>one knows and I have had an example<br>where a person said when I was saying<br>well you can't you know you actually<br>can't do this that way we can help you<br>find a different way the answer came<br>back cool it doesn't really matter<br>because by the time anyone finds out<br>that it's not right it'll be too late<br>saying it's too late I've already found<br>out and you can't do it and most times I<br>must say they are pretty rare you know<br>ministers do not want to break the law<br>ministers in government also put huge<br>stock and the legitimacy that comes to<br>them from operating according to law<br>sometimes they need help in vigilant<br>spot where is the line where is it<br>coming and as we see I've told another<br>group of people this morning saying we<br>haven't seen the New Zealand Bill of<br>Rights completely flicks its muscle yet<br>I don't think we're anywhere near<br>through seeing how far the Bill of<br>Rights will take us and what we will<br>understand to be the legal framework<br>into some things that the crown does and<br>argues are may seem unpopular they may<br>seem strange and that is when the<br>Solicitor General should be turning up<br>in the court to explain why the crown is<br>taking an argument that you know people<br>might argue up hill and down dale about<br>whether or not it's right and one thing<br>you'll have learned with law students<br>and lawyers is that the law is<br>contestable right you can you can always<br>find somebody who will argue the other<br>point may be successfully and it's so<br>obvious when you're in litigation that<br>you might persuade one person the high<br>court judge that to go with you you<br>might not be able to persuade all three<br>at the next level and that might go the<br>other way you can<br>another correct perhaps at the next five<br>and you might get a different result we<br>were counting up recently a case it's<br>been the newspaper the minister of<br>conservation route uh no sir damn<br>challenge went right from the High Court<br>Supreme Court when we counted up which<br>judges went to which way I think we have<br>five judges that overall through the<br>layers disagreed with the Crown's<br>position four judges that agreed with<br>the Crown's position and now the law is<br>that the Crown's position was wrong but<br>I think it's useful for us to think<br>about that because sometimes the crown<br>will have to put points push points<br>argue from extension of the law argue<br>for things that might not seem<br>attractive if you see them in the<br>newspaper and we've got to have the kind<br>of internal fortitude to know why we're<br>arguing it what purpose we're serving<br>and make sure that when the court is<br>dealing with it they get everything from<br>the crown and they get determine what<br>the law is and then if they change you<br>know if it's a change then that is the<br>law and we can place the law and on we<br>go so my functions are advisory advocacy<br>appearing in the courts and running<br>which Crammer offices the chief<br>executive but also being the<br>professional head of those 800 or 1200<br>depending how you cut it lawyers that we<br>have working government and the really<br>exciting thing for me and then I'll stop<br>in a moment and you can ask me some<br>questions the really exciting thing for<br>me is being able to harness that whole<br>crown capability to rip I mentioned<br>before you might sort of think is a bit<br>of a tension here about politician<br>senior law officer you know maybe even<br>public servant junior law officer are we<br>really have we really got the<br>independence that we need for law<br>officers to look at what's going on I<br>mean I'm not appointed into my role I<br>hold it at the government generals<br>pleasure so I can't be sect or promoted<br>by government and I don't get paid by<br>government I get paid by the independent<br>remuneration Authority at work that's<br>who sits my salary and I don't sit<br>within the usual structure of chief<br>executives performance pay and I don't<br>get paid by the government so these are<br>the features that make sure that the<br>role holder is independent and can<br>fearlessly advise governments that is<br>critical that ability to fiercely advise<br>government<br>I think it's a huge advantage that I sit<br>right within the system of public<br>service lawyers because it means that<br>people have access directly to the<br>solicitor I think it's a real advantage<br>another jurisdictions Australia for<br>example the solicitors general there are<br>one for every state and in a<br>Commonwealth one they are private sector<br>lawyers have met the bar usually<br>sometimes in firms and who act on<br>instruction and I think this is just my<br>own view that that distance that ability<br>to not ask the law officer a question<br>might not be a great advantage because I<br>don't have to wait to be asked a<br>question and I do and people find it<br>annoying I know broke my nose and where<br>I know will think that I need to be<br>either informed or these risk arising<br>that's not being managed or as I saying<br>to a may and Andrew before listening to<br>the radio in the morning is now so like<br>a health hazard because you listened to<br>the radio anything for I need to know<br>about that and you can and you are<br>entitled just to go and I think it's a<br>great advantage for our system so<br>political place to actually have any<br>questions or I ask you a question about<br>your vision and so you just started in<br>the throg it's a hugely important role<br>and and you know sometimes crowler will<br>can appear just to be the ambulance at<br>the bottom but again it's interesting to<br>hear you talk about your advisory role<br>but quite a lot of times you know it's a<br>fait accompli before it comes to you<br>that's only it's a new end up in court<br>and that's what you do and I just<br>wondered it's kind of the vision that<br>you had for Cranmore going forward was<br>to was to put more about how these<br>amazing lawyers that you've got so huge<br>resource talk about how different<br>vendors to private practice I mean the<br>difficulty for private practitioners is<br>that you can't see they have had the<br>money to be able to I mean even the<br>listening to the Solicitor General<br>talking about oh well you know take us<br>to high court and then you could always<br>go the court of appeal menu convertible<br>supreme court was most yeah point<br>significant if you can't get me on the<br>high court that's a I mean they've spent<br>all the money there isn't anymore so I'm<br>just wondering whether there's a vision<br>on your part and to have more of a<br>proactive role in problem solving if you<br>think that was a pepsi question that as<br>mater asked me because I've got an<br>answer bit<br>but I didn't ask you asking it but<br>absolutely I didn't bring my a three of<br>my vision but we absolutely have a<br>really clear vision about what we're<br>doing when I started in the crown office<br>I you know my pitch to the agent to the<br>place that was you know doing the visual<br>the shortlisting and interviewing and<br>Inter Minister was to say my vision is<br>that the sister General has to harness<br>the capability of all of the lawyers in<br>the crown in order to allow the crown<br>and exhibitor executive government to do<br>what it wants to achieve its policy aims<br>lawfully with the views of the future<br>and in a way that means that you're not<br>constantly having to battle backwards<br>through the courts to achieve what you<br>want to do in the end you know if I put<br>it on a bumper sticker it would say<br>lawyers ask us in Italy because if you<br>wait till the end<br>and ask lawyers to help if the court<br>lawyers can help we can say only you've<br>gone terribly wrong and we can help you<br>and you know it's pretty like nice<br>Superman complex to be able to help but<br>actually if we can show that we can help<br>more if you have start us here than if<br>you come when things have gone wrong or<br>the bitter and we're all in the one<br>crown I mean as madness that we would<br>wait to the end right so when I got into<br>the Crown Law Office I started to ask<br>this question what is the Crown Law that<br>New Zealand needs and we had never asked<br>that question before we had often<br>thought while we're here and what are we<br>about and we served the rule of law we<br>serve the crown actually if you went out<br>to you know suburbs in Auckland<br>Cambridge where I grew up and said we're<br>Department we serve the rule of law and<br>we serve the crown I don't have no idea<br>what we did so we started as what is the<br>Crown Law that New Zealand needs and we<br>came up with three outcomes that we are<br>now entirely focused on the first<br>demonstrably better government decisions<br>we argued long and hard with each other<br>about whether or not we should be saying<br>what we wanted was to achieve betterment<br>better government process we could map<br>back a debt we want actually better<br>decisions out of government and yes<br>process is a big part of it but you can<br>connect the process that looks nice and<br>that you might not have the decision<br>that's complied with the law well that<br>actually advances us and all sorts of<br>important areas like recognizing<br>Rights of the Bill of Rights act like<br>advance in the crown my relationship all<br>these big questions for New Zealand as a<br>society might not be answered by good<br>process we can't worry about one of our<br>outcomes we don't control these outcomes<br>lots of people contribute to them to<br>multiple EB the government decision<br>increasing the credibility or enhancing<br>the credibility of the rule of law<br>now my bumper-sticker version of that<br>was that what is I think the Chief<br>Justice the other day is making the rule<br>of law cool again you know she looked a<br>bit anxious but you know when lawyers<br>come around and this may be from my own<br>history of being an awful long time and<br>lawyers come around say oh the rule of<br>raw sewage can't do that actually most<br>ministers and other decision-makers<br>spent a lot of load of Bosh I want to do<br>that and you're not helping me by<br>talking about this thing that I don't<br>understand we must make sure that people<br>understand that the rule of law is a<br>benefit it is not a burden it is a huge<br>benefit of people can see that that is<br>how this country runs we can see<br>democracy right happens right in front<br>of us can we see the rule of law I don't<br>know I want and so in my role one of my<br>visions is that the crown speaks more<br>about what it's doing and why and in the<br>past it's always been very much we don't<br>talk about what's going on often we<br>can't because it's in front of the<br>courts but when we can I think we owe it<br>to people to say the reason that that<br>decision perhaps for agreeing that we<br>won't proceed with the murder charge but<br>that we would accept a plea to<br>manslaughter<br>what's for these reasons you might<br>recognize that story from last year<br>where we did come out and say why did it<br>happened the third thing we're doing is<br>our contributing to bitter criminal<br>justice outcomes and as I said before<br>making sure that we understand our<br>critical role in the criminal justice<br>system being a fair process by which we<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
