font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I left high school and went to work to<br>look after my grandfather when my<br>grandfather died he wanted me to be a<br>better man and he wanted me to get an<br>education and God directed towards the<br>TFC I applied for a to Yousef because at<br>that time it's been a while that I<br>finished my high school and I still<br>wanted to continue this study I applied<br>for TSA because when I came from England<br>my a-levels didn't quite match up with<br>what was required for studying health<br>sciences here I was a refugee and I've<br>ever brought my academic transcript from<br>my country so I had to do TFT to gain<br>university qualification to enter<br>mainstream courses I've been working for<br>a couple of years<br>needed to get back into academic study<br>and I don't have university insurance<br>chemistry and biology were very<br>interesting subjects I had never taken<br>them in high school taking them here and<br>learning them in quite vast lectures<br>will someone who has dedicated their<br>life to that subject you know it really<br>fuels your own passion I started I'm<br>English mave chemistry and biology first<br>were really different to how I got<br>taught during high school period<br>obviously it's more like university<br>style where the students and have a<br>choice of eight courses they go into<br>either science or arts and science they<br>can study chemistry biology and physics<br>and maths and English are compulsory and<br>an arts they have the choice of history<br>and geography and there's also a general<br>arts course in semester two all of those<br>courses aim to introduce students to the<br>basic academic skills that they need to<br>study at University and also given the<br>content relevant content that will help<br>I thought it was gonna be a lot more<br>heart out than it is but it definitely<br>it wasn't there it was a lot more<br>welcoming then what it seemed like it<br>was going to be and even the tutors and<br>everything like now that I'm in my first<br>year you can see the difference how much<br>it transitions you I wasn't quite sure<br>what to expect but it was almost like<br>high school but in a university setting<br>I thought it was just going to be one<br>year of intense study and then give me<br>two degree but I mean more than that I<br>think I've learned a lot about myself I<br>learned that I could do much more than I<br>thought because I thought I'd just come<br>to uni maybe do and that's degree but I<br>ended up realizing I could do law and go<br>and do all these other things much more<br>than I was expecting and I made a lot of<br>good friends but have to be independence<br>academically your lecturers will look<br>after you will teach you but only if you<br>look after yourself teasing really gives<br>you the skills to use all of the<br>resources that you need you'll learn<br>about that sls workshops which help you<br>with English writing things like that<br>NTC kind of helps you into there you've<br>got specific courses where you have to<br>go and use the library resources which<br>extremely helpful for first year they<br>teach you a lot of the basic skills of<br>essay writing and how to structure them<br>things which is really good for<br>for me challenging part was dealing with<br>the stress but I learned how to manage<br>my time and doing multitasking like<br>juggling the Bulls around one of the<br>biggest challenges that I faced and TFC<br>was the first assignment season and I<br>meant semester tests and then your first<br>round of exams I wasn't really prepared<br>for this kind of learning I think that<br>the biggest challenge would be<br>socializing because I'm new to the<br>country and I think they're very<br>international students and Micra and<br>refugees they do have the same issue of<br>socializing I think that I just overcome<br>that issue by making more friends and I<br>was engaging with more cultural<br>activities the final day when you used<br>to forgets annoying families at the end<br>you're together because we know how hard<br>you've worked to get there you've all<br>been through something that's made you<br>all come to tear see we finally see that<br>you've done it and then you've all made<br>it together<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
