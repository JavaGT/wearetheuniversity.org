Schultz, explains how mindfulness can make us more resilient and effective in an increasingly demanding world.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>well the growing interest in mindfulness<br>has been prompted I believe because of a<br>variety of factors first of all our<br>increasingly frantic pace of life it's<br>not okay anymore to do one thing at a<br>time we have to do 15 things at a time<br>and not only that but the way that we're<br>using technology we check our phones on<br>average 150 times a day and there's a<br>number of reasons that were enticed by<br>our technology often it's out of habit<br>or the need to keep up with what's going<br>on but also the reward center of our<br>brain releases a small amount of<br>dopamine which is a feel-good hormone<br>every single time something new or novel<br>pops up on our screen and that's<br>actually addictive so the pace of life<br>and the way we're using technology I<br>believe is pushing us to operate in a<br>state of what we call continuous partial<br>attention and that gives us that feeling<br>of friend tech nurse distraction in a<br>fragmented sense to our lives but I also<br>feel like we're operating on this flawed<br>notion that too busyness means happy and<br>successful and yet if you think about it<br>we're all racing around busy but I don't<br>see us all rolling around deliriously<br>happy<br>in fact the health consequences are<br>staggering depression is now the most<br>widespread illness globally a quarter of<br>us will suffer from some form of anxiety<br>in our lifetime stress-related illness<br>is the number one reason that people<br>visit the doctor today but it's not just<br>about the health consequences but<br>mindfulness has been proven to be<br>effective in all of those three areas<br>it's also about what we're missing out<br>on that ability to really connect with<br>each other that ability to do meaningful<br>real work so<br>think the pace of life and the<br>technology and the way that we're<br>running our lives are having a real<br>impact on our success and Happiness well<br>we've got this kind of frantic pace of<br>life that we're living and yet we've<br>still got this primitive part of our<br>brain which is operating and it's very<br>similar in fact to the fight-or-flight<br>response that you might see in a zebra<br>for example so let's imagine you've got<br>a zebra just relaxing on the plains of<br>Africa in next minute a lion leaps out<br>of the bush and the zebra is running for<br>its life activating its fight-or-flight<br>response<br>dumping cortisol and adrenaline into its<br>bloodstream shutting down its digestion<br>and its immune functionality now let's<br>say the zebra survives to live another<br>day and it's able to activate its<br>relaxation response and that is a form<br>of natural resilience and I think we've<br>lost our ability to be able to activate<br>our own natural resilience because our<br>fight-or-flight or panic button is being<br>pressed constantly all day just from<br>little things that the flood of email<br>coming into our inbox and we come to<br>work in the morning right through to<br>that horrible feeling that you're never<br>going to get to the bottom of your to-do<br>list so we're having this almost<br>constant reactivity to stress that's<br>happening throughout the day and I think<br>that is contributing to our health<br>health conditions as well so we've got<br>this sort of friend at pace of life<br>there's primitive part of the brain<br>activating our threat response<br>constantly throughout the day so we've<br>got a more on the executive functioning<br>part of our brain which is kind of<br>coming in and offering to help us out<br>and that gives us the ability to operate<br>on autopilot or to think about what<br>we're not doing so you probably have had<br>an experience of that we've driven home<br>from work you've pulled into the<br>driveway and then you've realized you've<br>not seen a thing on the journey home<br>because you've almost been operating<br>like in a trance but the problem is<br>we're spending so much time because our<br>lives are busy thinking about what's<br>just happened or planning or worrying<br>for what's about to happen that this<br>kind of direct experience that we're<br>having in any given moment is getting<br>squished in the middle<br>research has proven that we actually<br>only spend 47% of our time and our<br>direct experience and the more time we<br>spend thinking about what we're not<br>doing the more unhappy we are so right<br>now is really the only moment we have to<br>experience things like happiness and<br>success so for example a participant on<br>a recent course that I ran said for her<br>it was the little things like for<br>example recently in at work and a public<br>seating she was commended for a project<br>that she did and she just took a moment<br>for that praise to really sink in or<br>when she arrived home from work and was<br>greeted by her young daughter hugging<br>here having a moment to just feel the<br>warmth of that hug so mindfulness<br>training has a load of benefits but it's<br>really important to look at the<br>evidence-based research around the<br>benefits there's been a lot of hype<br>around mindfulness lately so it's<br>important to remember that there is 35<br>years of clinical research to support<br>the benefits of mindfulness and things<br>like anxiety depression illness and a<br>chronic pain we also know through<br>research that has been conducted on in<br>the area of neuroscience that<br>mindfulness actually makes physical<br>changes to our brain so it actually<br>increases the gray matter of our<br>hippocampus and that is the part of our<br>brain that's responsible for emotional<br>regulation it also decreases the gray<br>matter in our amygdala now there is our<br>bodies houses our threat response so<br>that's that trigger button so we're able<br>to react less to moments of stress<br>because of that so we've got some great<br>clinical research we've got some great<br>neuroscience data there is some really<br>promising research on mindfulness and<br>organizations the research is still in<br>its infancy but a review of all of the<br>Space Research conducted recently<br>concluded that mindfulness can have an<br>impact on areas of well-being of<br>performance and of relationships so<br>mindfulness can have a real impact on<br>our work experience and effectiveness<br>and I sort of see it happening over<br>three different levels if you build a<br>mindfulness practice up over time it'll<br>have an impact on your attention on your<br>awareness and on the way that you act so<br>on your attention increasing your<br>concentration span so you can manage<br>distraction in terms of your awareness<br>much more aware of what's happening<br>internally in terms of your tendency to<br>be thinking about the past or worrying<br>about the future but you're also able to<br>take in the full context of what's<br>happening around you and see things as<br>they really are and in the last area is<br>your actions so being able to manage how<br>you respond to pressure and stress and<br>conflict and not react but react but<br>rather respond more skillfully so<br>increasingly organizations are turning<br>to mindfulness based programs to support<br>things like in emotional intelligence<br>leadership and resilience but if it is<br>something that you wanted to explore<br>further then my advice would be first<br>off look for something that has<br>scientific evidence base behind it to<br>support its benefits and also look for<br>something that is going to give you<br>support over a period of weeks because<br>mindfulness training is like training at<br>the gym for your muscles it's not a<br>quick fix so you'd actually need<br>something to strengthen your mindfulness</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
