Mike<br>Duke uh it's a particular pleasure to<br>welcome Dr John and glenice Galler uh<br>who are here this evening and uh uh they<br>provided uh the generous endowment uh<br>which created uh the Dr John gallaer<br>chair in engineering that Professor Duke<br>tonight U we're acknowledging Mike<br>Duke's appointment to a professor in the<br>School of<br>Engineering Mike completed his design<br>apprenticeship uh studied mechanical<br>engineering at London southback poly<br>Technic uh graduating with a bachelor of<br>engineering honors in<br>1987 for the next year he was a graduate<br>engineer at Smith's Industries in the UK<br>developing fiber optic temperature<br>sensors for jet engines<br>for 17 years from 1988 Mike was a<br>research assistant lecturer and then<br>Senior lecturer at South Bank University<br>was the course director of the<br>international mechatronics degree and<br>The Bachelor of mechanical engineering<br>he was the founder and manager of the<br>South Bank University solar racing car<br>team and the sustainable transport<br>research group he completed his PhD at<br>South Bank University in<br>1998 during 2001 and 2002 Mike was<br>seconded to solar Century limited as<br>their new product development manager<br>and devised their product development<br>strategy he went on to become the<br>co-founder and technical director of<br>Solon limited a spinout company that<br>developed photo photovoltaic products<br>including the internationally patented<br>and widely used sunmount<br>system Mike came to the University of<br>wart in 2005 initially appointed as a<br>senior lecturer then becoming an<br>associate professor in the School of<br>Engineering he went on to become the<br>mechanical engineering program leader<br>founder and leader of the Agri<br>engineering research group and solar<br>engineering research group and the<br>leader of the electric vehicle research<br>he's actively involved in product<br>development and Innovation through<br>research and teaching with a number of<br>local<br>companies during his time at this<br>University Mike has received over $4<br>million in external research income<br>including a $2.6 million MB subcontract<br>for robotics in<br>Horticulture currently his main focus is<br>leading Agri engineering research in the<br>area of smart Automation and<br>Robotics the agriengineering group<br>comprises four academics five PhD<br>students three Masters and one<br>post-doctoral researcher the group Works<br>close mostly with end users engineering<br>companies and other research providers<br>to develop solutions for the primary<br>Industries Mike was appointed to the Dr<br>John gallahad chair in engineering at<br>2016 ladies and gentlemen uh will you<br>please welcome Professor Mike Juke to<br>give his inaugural professorial lecture<br>entitled robotics in primary Industries<br>uh thank you Vice Chancellor I think<br>when you you hear your CV being read out<br>you realize how old you are which is uh<br>always a bit of a worry um today I'm<br>going to talk about robotics in the<br>primary Industries um I believe we're at<br>the beginning of a revolution in this<br>sector and I'm hoping that by the end of<br>today's presentation or lecture you will<br>maybe believe the same thing um it's a<br>controversial issue because some people<br>say if we introduce robotics we're going<br>to take away people's jobs but I'd like<br>to hopefully show make the case that<br>that that isn't what's going to happen<br>Okay so uh the first thing I'd like to<br>do I'd just like to reiterate what the<br>vice Chancellor said and really thank<br>the Gallagher family for the support of<br>the uh the chair Dr Dr John Gallagher<br>chair in engineering it's a big uh it's<br>a big bonus for the School of<br>Engineering because we we are still<br>relatively young and we really do<br>appreciate the support that we've got<br>from the gag family so thank you very<br>much for that okay okay the first thing<br>I'm going to do is set the scene because<br>there's a bit of a story behind why<br>we're even talking about robotics in the<br>prime industry and what we have here is<br>a uh a pie chart of New Zealand's<br>merchandise exports for<br>2016 and what if you look at it it's<br>broke into different sectors and what's<br>quite interesting that if you draw a<br>line that little white line breaks it<br>down into two parts one is other and<br>metals and so forth and manufactured<br>goods the big chunk on the right hand<br>side which comprises over 60% of new New<br>Zealand's exports is the primary sector<br>The primary sector being the dairy the<br>wood the um meat industry all of the all<br>of those what we call the primary<br>Industries so uh even though there's a<br>push that we might move to a more uh<br>manufacturing based economy we are still<br>highly dependent on the primary<br>Industries which is hence why I'm<br>interested in how we can improve the<br>primary Industries using sort of<br>Robotics and smart<br>automation uh couple with that the<br>ministry for primary Industries have got<br>a goal to double primary industry<br>exports relative to 2012 by the year<br>2025 so this is a very demanding very<br>challenging goal to achieve so that<br>means we've actually got to double the<br>exports since then in in the in the<br>primary sector and it's a sector that is<br>actually already running at quite what<br>you might consider quite hot so you're<br>thinking well how are you going to make<br>these different efficiency gains to get<br>that um to double the export by that<br>time uh and of course coupled with that<br>this is where we come in as Engineers um<br>we've identified that the problems are<br>being faced by The primary sector are<br>things like this this is from 2016 Fruit<br>Growers face huge labor shortage for<br>bumper Harvest uh it's the old adage<br>that it's really difficult to get labor<br>in The primary sector for example<br>harvesting and a lot of the companies<br>who we deal with will come to us saying<br>can you sol our problem we cannot get<br>the people to do the work so that's one<br>of the issues so so in one way we've<br>been told you got to improve your<br>increase your exports and then you've<br>got these issues which stop you from<br>doing it uh the next one is uh change in<br>labor legislation so this is another<br>news article saying that people are<br>using seasonal workers suddenly have are<br>facing problems with uh meeting the the<br>requirements of care for the workers so<br>it's a good idea to increase exports but<br>you've then got barriers being put in<br>front of the producers that can hinder<br>them getting that growth that's required<br>and so one is labor shortages that's one<br>of the biggest problems being faced the<br>second one we get is labor cost because<br>of the labor shortage a lot of New<br>Zealand primary sector companies are<br>actually importing labor from overseas<br>and we see this all the time if I go off<br>looking at KY fruit picking or seedling<br>tree harvesting I will not see many<br>kiwis there or hardly any it's all being<br>uh all that work is being undertaken by<br>imported labor okay and it costs a lot<br>of money because there's a whole series<br>you actually going through middle middle<br>people middle companies to provide you<br>with that labor and it becomes very<br>expensive the other one is labor<br>legislation so now got things about L<br>care which is good for ethical reasons<br>but it adds another layer of complexity<br>and cost to those primary sector<br>providers and it gets worse you've then<br>got quality control uh for example if<br>you're harvesting<br>forestry seedlings then you have to do<br>the quality control check when you're<br>doing the harvesting and sudden you've<br>got these imported labor who don't<br>really understand quality control and<br>really don't have any buying to the<br>company so you've now got a quality<br>control issue with the uh with the<br>harvesting for example harvesting you've<br>then got labor reliability we've spoken<br>to companies where one day they need 20<br>people to turn up to harvest all this uh<br>for examp seedlings for example and only<br>six people turn up so they then have to<br>turn to the hired Labor uh bringing in<br>imported labor which then needs more<br>training so in fact it's their biggest<br>problem they don't have a problem with<br>the technology side of things really<br>it's a problem is of of actually growing<br>the crop it's a problem of the people<br>that they're having the workers are the<br>biggest issue and finally not quite<br>finally but one of the other issues we<br>add to that is health and safety<br>legislation so uh certainly the comp<br>again the companies we've been dealing<br>with they're saying look we've now we<br>now want to come up with ways where we<br>can mitigate or or reduce the amount of<br>uh health and safety injuries because<br>it's going up the line in the company<br>through to the directors so it's become<br>another big problem and the last thing<br>that we've seen and very interesting for<br>us as Engineers is this one which is<br>obsolete uh Machinery so we'll go around<br>to many different Farm areas or primary<br>sector uh uh places and you'll just see<br>old Antiquated Machinery that doesn't<br>match the needs of the modern uh the<br>modern era it's really out of date and<br>it needs to be completely redeveloped<br>and of course for us Engineers that's a<br>that's a good way forward and so what<br>I'm going to do with this talk I'm<br>actually going to use a series of case<br>studies which we'll move to in a minute<br>uh to show how we can sort of address<br>some of these issues that we've uh that<br>we've identified and so the question<br>we're going to ask is can Robotics and<br>what we call Smart automation help solve<br>some of the issues that I've just<br>outlined okay and at that point everyone<br>knows that I'm a bit of a a history fan<br>so I'm going to move to a bit of uh<br>hopefully if everything works well uh a<br>bit of History this is a this is a<br>factory of 1930s which is a Ford<br>factory and if you just look at that<br>you'll see that there are literally<br>thousands of workers in that factory and<br>that's the way it used to be you'd have<br>tens of thousands of people clocking in<br>every morning there would be uh they'd<br>all be doing very repetitive jobs often<br>they were dangerous they were boring<br>there's a lot of dirt involved and I<br>mean with if we're really honest do we<br>really think that is the way for the<br>modern worker to be and I'd say no<br>that's what we expect from a modern<br>Factory all those jobs have been<br>replaced with robots and here you can<br>see if you look around here you'll just<br>see there's a few people wandering<br>around maybe a dozen or so whereas in<br>the old days there were thousands and<br>we've we've accepted that in a factory<br>environment robots are the norm and even<br>in China that's becoming there there's a<br>lot more robots being used in the<br>Chinese industry do we really want to<br>see people doing a mundane boring job of<br>for example sorting fig on a day in day<br>out a Mindless task no we don't want to<br>see that and in fact if you go to a pack<br>house in New Zealand you won't see this<br>what you'll see is this which is an<br>automated system for sorting and Grading<br>apples now this machine was actually<br>developed in New Zealand uh by a company<br>called<br>Compact and what it actually does this<br>is a Machine Vision system as the apples<br>pass along uh these lines they're<br>rotated round and they go through that<br>little camera there and they take about<br>57 56 pictures of each apple and they<br>spread the skin out on a computer screen<br>and then a computer algorithm looks to<br>see where the different uh quality of<br>that apple is and from that it can<br>decide whether is this an a grade apple<br>or is it a a juicer the PO you know if<br>you're lucky a grade Apple you come<br>really expensive so the challenge we've<br>got is to is about can robotics move<br>from factories where it's all very<br>controlled to the<br>fields okay<br>uh minut so one of the issues we've got<br>with this is if you uh think about a<br>factory everything is controlled you've<br>got control over the um the space you<br>have and the same with the pack house<br>but if you look at this environment in<br>the field you can see that there are a<br>lot of uh it's not a controlled<br>environment at all you've got dappled<br>sunlight coming through you've got the<br>kiwi fruit in this case in different<br>positions you've got leaves you got<br>vines in the way it could be raining so<br>you know you are moving from a<br>controlled environment to a much harsher<br>environment that you have to work within<br>and this is one of the reasons why it's<br>taken a while for for robotics to to<br>move into the primary Industries in the<br>field good in the pack houses good in<br>the factories but it's a big issue when<br>you start moving it into the fields and<br>that's the challenge of our research<br>group so what I'm going to do is I'm<br>going to start with a a simple case<br>study of what we call Smart Automation<br>and this work was undertaken uh in<br>partnership with a company called aragen<br>who grow forestry seedlings and they<br>came to us with a problem of quality<br>they said we cannot produce um uh<br>seedlings of the right quality we got a<br>lot of rejections and this work was<br>undertaken by Ben MC Guinness and it was<br>in partnership with Callahan Innovation<br>and it was all about dibbling and for<br>those of you who don't know what<br>dibbling is it's making holes in the<br>ground so you can plant uh seedlings for<br>example and here's a picture of a this<br>is this is a uh forestry Nursery in<br>tokoroa here you can see the worker<br>there is he got loads of little holes<br>and he's putting seedlings in these<br>holes what a what a what a pretty bad<br>job so the next one of the jobs we'll be<br>looking at is how to replace that with<br>an autom at system but you can see it's<br>very very tedious job and this is the DI<br>so we talk about obsolete Machinery this<br>thing is basically a wheel with spikes<br>in it and you might think well that's<br>great nice and simple but as that Spike<br>goes around it actually tears the dirt<br>so you end up with a v-shaped hole<br>rather than a straight hole which is<br>what they need to do the planting with<br>and so because of that you end up with<br>the seedlings all at funny little angles<br>they're all sort of ski whiff and when<br>they grow they grow<br>if you see here you see where the<br>seedlings have all been put into the<br>little holes they're all at different<br>angles and then they can as they grow<br>they grow with the sweep on them and a<br>sweep is rejected during the Quality<br>Control process so this is the type of<br>thing that we're getting faced with by<br>companies and it it least a very nice<br>little contracts for example a good<br>Callahan Innovation contract with a good<br>researcher like Ben mcginness means that<br>we can come up with solutions to that<br>problem and this is the solutions this<br>is a replacement for the spoked wheel<br>now I've deliberately got bended to make<br>a nice computer graphic model of this<br>cuz the way that we actually design this<br>type of Machinery is done using what we<br>call 3D CAD so this is a virtual model<br>of a of a dibbling machine so this is an<br>automatic machine instead of having<br>spiked Wheels you've now got drill bits<br>on it it's got a little wheel at the<br>front which which can as it moves across<br>we can with it with an encoder we can<br>pick up the position of it and once we<br>take that CAD model we can convert it<br>into a physical dibler and the engineers<br>amongst you will be saying well how do<br>you drill a hole when the actual tractor<br>is being pulled behind it and what Ben<br>has done here he got a little computer<br>on board hence the smart Automation and<br>it senses the speed of the of the<br>tractor so it knows the speed and it's<br>got a Pneumatic Ram that actually<br>travels at the same speed of the tractor<br>as it goes forward as it goes down so it<br>does like a little vshape and that<br>dibbling machine has now been in<br>operation for 4 years and I think today<br>we were estimating that it's drilled<br>over 12 million holes for aragen and<br>it's a classic case of how smart<br>automation can dramatically improve the<br>quality in The primary sector a<br>relatively simple one but I thought I'd<br>leave this in just to give you a bit of<br>an idea of where it comes from look at<br>that perfectly straight seedlings a<br>beautiful flat bed it took us ages to<br>make this and uh and that's really what<br>we're aiming for and of course the<br>company were very happy and it had lots<br>of side effects for example with this<br>one we found that they could actually<br>plant two at a time because they didn't<br>have to sort of figure out what<br>direction it went in so they got<br>productivity improvements quality<br>improvements and if you look at the<br>state of the bed it didn't damage the<br>bed as much either so it was a very good<br>solution Ben mcginness who did this work<br>is a wake at a<br>graduate such a good job did Ben do uh<br>that aragen said could you build a<br>lifter grader machine for us<br>and we're that's how hard can it be we<br>said and so this uh again it's with aren<br>and with Callahan Invasion and Ben was<br>also been helped by three other wetto<br>students uh Gordon uh uh and Jerry I<br>forgot the middle one that Malcolm here<br>we go this is the problem lots of<br>seedlings planted in in lines Millions<br>upon millions of them six million<br>roughly and what you have to do if you<br>want to harvest that seedling it's done<br>by hand you pull the seedling out the<br>ground<br>you knock off the dirt you take your<br>hand up it like this you then trim Off<br>The Roots and then you have to look at<br>the root structure and decide is that uh<br>a good one or a bad one and just<br>remember now that there's very strict<br>criteria for<br>this and so that's problem and so the<br>way we do this is often we'll build what<br>we call Dirty prototypes and this is<br>something that any of the engineering<br>students know that are very uh believ so<br>we'll come up with a solution for this<br>so we're going to lift them using belts<br>we'll remove some dirt dirt and we then<br>build a prototype which is really crude<br>and dirty take it down and see if we can<br>lift out the seedings and here we go<br>we're quite happy with this we're not<br>saying the belts was our idea but um uh<br>ultimately we've used this idea and<br>we've managed to pull the seedlings out<br>of the bed and we can start to knock the<br>dirt off it and in effect it's a part of<br>that part of Applied research is also<br>good for aret because then they can<br>decide is it worth going ahead once<br>they've decided we'll produce a general<br>Arrangement drawing and here's what we<br>think the final machine will look like<br>which then goes to the client so this is<br>the lift deg grader General drawing once<br>we have that we're now moving to the<br>phase where we have to build something<br>but originally but but next thing is we<br>got to actually turn it into a virtual<br>3D model and this is it it's a factory<br>being pulled behind a tractor that will<br>lift out the ceedings with the belts it<br>will knock off the dirt it will trim the<br>roots and then it does the really clever<br>bit which is where you get your PhD work<br>from it drops them into a little box<br>where it will grade them and the grading<br>is done using uh computer vision so it's<br>a computer vision control system so up<br>in this little box up so after the roots<br>have come off it'll sit into a little<br>holder a camera will take images of the<br>roots and the top and the side and it<br>will decide whether that's a good one or<br>a bad one based on the criteria given by<br>aren so there you can see the little<br>little device on the side so it's got<br>lights in it and cameras and that all<br>feeds into a computer which then<br>undertakes an algorithm to decide<br>whether it's good or bad once we've done<br>that we have to manufacture the machine<br>and I'd like to make a plug here for our<br>local company stainless design who are<br>excellent we can go from our virtual<br>model of or virtual design of a lifter<br>grader and we can send data file<br>straight to sustainless design B up to<br>wrapper they'll L cut all out they even<br>weld stuff together for you and<br>basically we can have a kit of parts for<br>our lifter grade which is really that's<br>a modern way to do it and it's another<br>reason why we can do this type of work<br>in the primary<br>Industries we also use a lot of 3D<br>printing that's become pretty commonly<br>known and right now this is a this is<br>not I wish it was false I wish this was<br>actually as fast as it goes but it isn't<br>uh this is a a time lapse takes about<br>eight hours to build something um<br>typically with our 3D printers and it's<br>actually building this at the moment and<br>this is a part of a kiwi fruit<br>harvesting robot and you can see here<br>that once it's basically actually built<br>using additive technology rather than uh<br>removed like the old<br>way this is this is the machine as it is<br>as of a few few days ago so it's in in<br>the test phase down in the lab and you<br>can see all the belts and everything are<br>working and uh so we're probably two or<br>3 weeks away maybe a month from having<br>all the wheels on and to go down and<br>trial it at aragen to me this is a very<br>very ambitious project and is a tribute<br>to to Ben in particular as a good old<br>ycat graduate who can design one of the<br>most complicated sort of INF field<br>systems that I know this is a smart bit<br>so what Ben's done here he's used<br>something called uh open CV which is a<br>computer vision software and it's a<br>library and he's importing images of all<br>the different different tree uh SE Lings<br>so they've come off they've been<br>harvested and he's putting him through<br>his little system he's taking images of<br>the root and the height and the stem and<br>from that he's developed an algorithm<br>based on the needs of aragen for grading<br>and he's basically got a tick or a cross<br>depending on whether it's a good one or<br>a bad one okay and uh so that took B<br>obviously quite a lot of time to do that<br>and it's a very smart piece of uh<br>programming and it's directly linked to<br>the hardware if it's good it gets<br>flipped off to the left if it's bad it<br>gets flipped off to the right into into<br>a into a Mulcher so we did a study so<br>what we did U we took uh 200 seedlings<br>and we took the three best graders from<br>aragen and we compared the results of<br>them grading the seedlings as uh<br>compared to to the algorithm developed<br>by Ben uh and what was amazing was that<br>Benz could grade as well as they could<br>so we've actually that's already been<br>achieved the other thing so here's the<br>final machine obviously we're going to<br>try and test this in a a few weeks time<br>we have to come up with a name and we've<br>called it the Beast because it's big and<br>scary okay so that's the machine and<br>hopefully within a few weeks time we'll<br>see that operating another company comes<br>this is new research I'm just going to<br>give you an idea of what we're up to uh<br>asparagus harvesting so uh tender tips<br>came to us who grow asparagus and said<br>we having real issues harvesting<br>asparagus and so did boids and this was<br>a really good opportunity to work with<br>our partners robotics plus with a bit of<br>funding from Kahan Innovation and all of<br>these people involved in the work so we'<br>got Matthew Peebles and Mike Min as phds<br>supervised by myself uh Dr Lim and Al<br>plus four year four fourth year<br>mechanical students the objective is to<br>robotically harvested asparagus and why<br>do you want to do that because of this<br>uh if you if you had a 100 hectares of<br>asparagus Farm you have to walk that<br>every day during the harvesting season a<br>distance of 600 kilm now you can't do<br>that with one person while you could try<br>or you have to employ 80 workers all of<br>whom are imported there are no kiwis who<br>do this work it is backbreaking Medieval<br>work and it's very expensive for The<br>Growers so this is uh objective of this<br>is to replace what is happening here<br>with some sort of robotic system system<br>so and how do we do that one of the<br>biggest issues we have is is actually<br>trying to detect or find where the<br>asparagus is and so that's the current<br>state of this work so it's very new<br>stuff so here is a 3D printed bit of<br>asparagus and uh it's being moved by the<br>way on the bottom left is a sensor<br>called a<br>liar which is a light detection ranging<br>sensor it's basically scanning a laser<br>like this and it's picking up the<br>distances and what it shows is that with<br>the liar we can actually locate that KY<br>through and that's the work of Matthew<br>and and uh Mike at the moment and with<br>our new robot thanks to capex uh we can<br>demonstrate the uh the performance that<br>we can actually detect this uh asparagus<br>so it's just early days for that piece<br>work quite cool and now what we do is<br>have a little look at what the liar sens<br>is actually giving us so if you look at<br>it um on the right hand side those<br>little dots you see are actually the<br>robot body and the little dots you see<br>gradually which occasionally move are<br>that asparagus so it just gives you an<br>idea of what the sensors are picking up<br>and because of that you can actually get<br>the XY coordinates of that piece of<br>asparagus which can then be fed back<br>into the robotic software and a new bit<br>of software uh a new uh systems been<br>called Robot Operating System which is<br>being used by both Matthew and Mike for<br>this work and you can just see the way<br>that you can control see the position of<br>the asparagus and you can move the robot<br>to that location which now means you can<br>start to detect these robot these this<br>sort of asparagus in the Real<br>Environment moving on now this is the<br>biggest research project we have which<br>is the Horticultural robotics project<br>funded by MB the ministry of business uh<br>Innovation and<br>employment it's a a partnership between<br>the University of ockland wo University<br>plant and food research and the<br>industrial part partner robotics plus so<br>how much is this project worth well it's<br>with the input from robotics plus it's<br>over $10 million so this is a very big<br>robotics in The primary sector uh<br>project the objective is to harvest and<br>pollinate uh to harvest kiwi fruit app<br>pollinate apple and kiwi fruit flowers<br>what I would like to the other thing on<br>this one is if we're going to do this<br>work we need to have something to put<br>the robots on and most of you are<br>familiar with driverless cars<br>and what we can see here is the Google<br>driverless car and how it's Drive<br>navigating around roads now if we're<br>going to have robots that are going to<br>harvest kiwi fruit and apples we're<br>going to have to have something that can<br>navigate around<br>Orchards and so that's a key part of<br>this research work is to develop<br>something that you can put on this this<br>pollination equipment or the harvesting<br>uh equipment and it can drive drive<br>around and here it is this is called an<br>ammp an autonomous multi-purpose mobile<br>platform a very catchy name and it's<br>developed as a part of the uh the<br>research work that we're doing and the<br>uh it's basically a large electric<br>vehicle so what we have on the on the on<br>the uh the back there are two there's<br>two electric motors at the back two<br>electric motors at the front you see it<br>driving along here so it all works and<br>it's so basically a four-wheel drive<br>electric vehicle all batteries are<br>sitting under under that area there<br>under the flat bit with the controllers<br>it's got a little generator on there for<br>generating electricity for running all<br>the computers and for and for compressed<br>air so we've actually achieved one of<br>the Milestones of the MB contract is to<br>have an autonomous platform that can<br>self-navigate around an orchard using<br>liar again so it scan canopy of the of<br>the Orchard and then it can self-drive<br>around and that's a collaboration<br>between Oakland University and wetto<br>University in particular with with a lot<br>of input from robotics plus our major<br>industrial part and I'll say it's a<br>pretty cool machine okay it weighs about<br>one and a half ton that's one of my<br>favorite things then got to harvest<br>fruit so how do we do that well we know<br>that we if you just look at this you can<br>see one of the problems of The primary<br>sector you've got all these Ki fruit at<br>different angles different heights<br>there's leaves in the way there's uh you<br>know you get dappled light coming<br>through which can affect the sensors and<br>this is one of the early robot OTS which<br>was used to move from place to place<br>this is an early prototype of the kiwi<br>fruit harvesting arm and this is the<br>team so what I'd like to point out is<br>the one between the robot is Dr Alis<br>scarf the CEO of the company robotics<br>plus and here we got the team from<br>Oakland and this is the first prototype<br>arm that is being that was that is<br>pictured here to to harvest kiwi fruit<br>and we believe we actually applied for a<br>world record on this but with the<br>Guinness book records didn't get back to<br>us on it and this is the robot working<br>so what is happening at the moment is<br>that there are cameras down below which<br>are looking up at the canopy they're<br>using something called stereo Vision<br>these these digital images go into the<br>computer software and using open CV<br>which is O computer vision um the um a<br>3D map of the canopy is created with the<br>kiwi fruit so you get the XY Z<br>coordinate of each kiwi fruit it then<br>goes through a system system of<br>scheduling where it works out which<br>doesn't get them all it's a<br>prototype got to be fair it's pretty<br>tough stuff it's doing<br>here it's uh you<br>know sometimes it makes the odd mistake<br>but uh it's this was this was the first<br>one too of AD you do we were pretty<br>happy that we actually could Harvest<br>that many kber fruits successfully and<br>the other thing you might know we talk<br>about 3D printing those gripper ends<br>that you see were actually all 3D<br>printed in titanium CU we wanted you<br>know why we did that because we could<br>right cuz we're engineers and we went oh<br>we could 3D print them in titanium let's<br>do that and was it expensive yes would<br>we do it again no but it was it was fun<br>you know we've all had a you know what<br>we've now printed we're now printing in<br>carbon fiber we've actually got a 3D<br>carbon fiber printer so it's a very cool<br>robot and this was the first time it<br>actually worked uh but after that um you<br>know you have to go back and look at how<br>to improve that fruit you might notice<br>so we think it's squishing too much on<br>that on the kiwi fruit which we've<br>addressed with the new design so there's<br>the the latest design of kiwi fruit<br>Harvester and this was actually done by<br>uh they took we had a group of three<br>mechanical engineering students here<br>they are there's Catherine and uh parum<br>and Kanan and they their job for the<br>last year was to take the old kiwi fruit<br>um and turn it into a commercial one and<br>they did it they did a fantastic job<br>they've basically got it to the point<br>where it's commercial and now there<br>really is just a case of a few minor<br>changes very small changes and then it's<br>ready to uh be commercialized and I'm<br>very proud of what these students have<br>achieved that they you know they come in<br>at wetto and they could go out and they<br>can design and build Machinery of that<br>level we should be very proud of what<br>we've achieved it makes me feel good as<br>a lecturer known that we that we produce<br>such high quality<br>graduates this is the current state this<br>was only taken a few days ago so what we<br>have here is<br>the we've we're going to actually have<br>four kiwi fruit harvesting arms on this<br>robot but what we have here is just<br>three and it's a test we're now we've<br>now looking up can we control where the<br>arms are using the software and and this<br>platform you see the big black bit<br>underneath that's where the computers<br>are that run the robots they are going<br>to be bolt that's going to be bolted<br>onto the platform the aous mobile<br>platform the grippers will be put on and<br>then it will be ready to go and harvest<br>uh kiwi fruit in a couple weeks time so<br>it's very close to having a full forearm<br>otic system working okay and we're<br>really excited to see if that will<br>actually work out so this is very much<br>the testing phase where we're just<br>literally running each one of the motors<br>and the actuators just to see if where<br>we're saying it's going does it actually<br>go there<br>okay so the after this we've now got to<br>this is what the final Beast is going to<br>look like it's another Beast it's going<br>to have four arms on it mounted on the<br>autonomous platform and that is then<br>going to go around the orchard<br>autonomous ly and harvest kiwi fruit how<br>crazy is<br>that a little side issue to that we have<br>do apples as well I don't know if you're<br>aware but apple orchards are being<br>redesigned at the moment instead of<br>having those lovely little round trees<br>they're being linearized they're not<br>being linearized because of Robotics<br>they're being linearized because that<br>you can get increased yield by pointing<br>them towards the Sun and linearizing<br>them it just so happens that it's also<br>beneficial for harvesting because um<br>it's much easier to harvest on a linear<br>system for robotically than it is on<br>round trees so we had a group of fourth<br>year students top quality students who<br>developed a prototype Apple harvesting<br>Scara arm and what it does that they did<br>a lot of work with uh plant and food<br>research with on how to develop it this<br>is the Prototype note beautifully laser<br>cuton anodized with lots of 3D printed<br>Parts the way we like to work and the<br>little arm at the end will go in pick up<br>the Apple suck it onto the little vacuum<br>cup twist it and then drop it down into<br>the slot so that's for that's actually<br>sorry four final year mechanical<br>students who did this and they ended up<br>their project was one of the top three<br>mechanical engineering projects in New<br>Zealand and here it is little prototype<br>sorry about the quality of the film but<br>this was done at the engineering design<br>show and you can see here that Zara<br>who's one of the students is just<br>demonstrating the little the little cup<br>goes onto the end with a suction it does<br>a rotation that's all controlled by a<br>computer it then does a Twist and drops<br>it down to the shoot what they did was<br>they showed that it's possible to<br>develop robotics for that<br>application the last well one of the big<br>ones left over is is flower pollination<br>so this is a kiwi fruit uh Orchard with<br>all the flowers in them and you've<br>basically bees don't like kiwi fruit<br>flowers so it's pollinated in two<br>different ways one way is someone goes<br>around and squirts each flow<br>individually and the other way is powder<br>is thrown all over it so one of the<br>issues we had was to try and robotic<br>pollinate them and this is a game Cher<br>for us this is something called Deep<br>neural networks uh you've got to<br>actually locate 200 flowers for every<br>meter that you travel and you're<br>traveling at a meter per second and so<br>this this method which is like<br>replicating the way the human brain<br>works was u a Training Method and it<br>could actually recognize the the flowers<br>in real time very quickly it completely<br>was a game changer and it replaced A<br>system that wasn't working properly<br>which was called stereo vision which<br>just wasn't quick enough so you know<br>words like Game Changer I know they're<br>used a lot but it really is going to be<br>make a massive difference to The primary<br>sector at robotics by the fact that you<br>can recognize these strange shapes uh<br>very quickly and then you can Target<br>Target<br>them so the only thing with this is we<br>actually literally that is on The<br>Cutting Edge of Technology we had to buy<br>special computers that had the graphical<br>uh power to do this and they would<br>basically you can only buy them like one<br>at a time they were so brand new off the<br>production line<br>you put it all together and suddenly uh<br>you know this is a part of Robotics plus<br>you've got your autonomous mobile<br>platform you've now got your deep neural<br>network Machine Vision system and now<br>we've got the pollination system on it<br>it's not a full pollinator it's only got<br>two two booms but this is a self-driving<br>robot that is looking up at the canopy<br>recognizing flowers and then hitting<br>them with a spray of pollen how mad is<br>that and it's actually happen happening<br>this isn't like something this has<br>actually happened just a few months ago<br>so this is brand new research results<br>and uh you know there's still a lot of<br>work to be done to really refine it to<br>the point where it's commercial but it's<br>close to that commercial Tipping Point<br>The Tipping Point for these is you've<br>got to travel over a meter per second<br>and probably hit about 90% of the<br>flowers it's not there yet but we're<br>hoping that will be achieved about um<br>sort of November December this year so<br>you have a look you can see the you can<br>see that the spray is going up and<br>hitting the flowers it's probably a bit<br>too spr spray at the moment a bit too<br>vicious and is hitting the flowers but<br>the concept works okay other people have<br>tried it but this is probably the best<br>example that we've seen interesting to<br>note if you've got a robot it doesn't<br>have to go to sleep this thing can run<br>night and day you're Illuminating the<br>canopy anyway and now you can literally<br>uh spray them uh night and day and<br>therefore get the value back on that<br>very expensive piece of equipment and<br>you all probably going L me how does<br>this work and the other thing you notice<br>how it misses a canopy that's all done<br>again using liar and it literally will<br>will scan the canopy and then move up<br>and down relative to it so here's the<br>look sprang so you just see it moving up<br>and down and that's just keeping a<br>distance from it we've calculated that<br>when it's at full speed it'll have to<br>you'll have to fire 200 shots a second<br>to hit the flowers so it's pretty uh<br>pretty<br>challenging but uh yeah it's uh very<br>impressive and this work the the<br>pollination side of it it's being done<br>by plant and food all the hardware is<br>done by WETA graduates okay and then we<br>work with Oakland University to link the<br>Deep learning so we got Mark Jones of<br>wetto linked with Oakland University<br>researchers to get that<br>working this is a great<br>opportunity uh for New Zealand to export<br>high value machinery and services and<br>that's one of the things that's been<br>overlooked is it's not just that we can<br>produce you know we can improve primary<br>sector efficiency and hopefully exports<br>but it's also an opportunity to export<br>new uh products and services overseas so<br>you get two bangs for your buck and so I<br>think what I'd like to hopefully said in<br>in in a talk today I know we only it's<br>quite a short talk 35 minutes is that<br>what we talk about as a vision for<br>robotics in the primary industry as<br>something we're thinking in the future<br>well I'm I'd like to say to you now that<br>a it's needed and B that that revolution<br>has already started it's on its way<br>there so anyway I'd like to thank you<br>very much for listening and I hope you<br>enjoyed a little review of robotic<br>H so good evening everybody Kora<br>Koro um as the dean of<br>engineering gives me enormous pleasure<br>to actually give a vote of thanks for uh<br>Professor uh M duk's inaugural<br>lecture um certainly before this lecture<br>I never knew the word dibbling I thought<br>I knew a little bit about agriculture<br>but you know that was a new one for me<br>but um You probably sensed many of you<br>probably know Mike anyway um but the<br>talk I think encapsulates his enthusiasm<br>energy and dynamism really in this area<br>of engineering even to the extent of<br>using titanium to make some gadgets or<br>whatever you want to be doing um and<br>actually for us um that enthusiasm is<br>really important because it's um um from<br>the short period of time I've known Mike<br>for three months I can see it translates<br>into both um his teaching on the<br>undergraduate program uh research<br>projects um and the research major<br>research programs You' just just heard<br>about um and actually just reflecting on<br>what you actually you showed Mike I<br>thought the the black and white movie of<br>car production in the<br>1930s as a comparison with fruit and veg<br>picking in the 2000 or 21st century was<br>very telling um I hadn't seen that<br>before and I I think that emphasizes the<br>need to um um to incorporate this sort<br>of um the automation of small thinking<br>and in terms of exports of course it's a<br>no-brainer really that you can see the<br>same pressures on a much larger scale<br>are going to be facing countries like U<br>the UK who no doubt are wanting to um<br>strike some very good trade deals in the<br>near future thought um so it's um<br>probably the last thing I should be<br>saying really is that I could see that<br>that that enthusiasm and dynamism that<br>you AB<br>uh is going to be pretty critical really<br>for the School of Engineering um at<br>workato U because uh for those of you<br>who know of us um we're going through<br>quite a period of growth and I would say<br>rediscovery rediscovery in the sense<br>that it's um emphasizing more about us<br>being problem solvers uh and problem<br>solvers engaged in the outside world<br>which means in the short time I've been<br>here I've been very impressed in going<br>around and seeing the work you've been<br>caring out Mike in the likes of robotic<br>press and RAM 3D where you see quite<br>aming amazing research being carried out<br>and often those companies are very<br>grateful for what you're doing because<br>your research team are embedded in those<br>Industries in their labs and their<br>offices and even the field workor so<br>that's a very impressive um impressive<br>um contribution to make in US defining<br>ourselves and really differentiating who<br>we are con outside world so if you could<br>um join me now really and give our</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
