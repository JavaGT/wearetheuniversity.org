Pre-clinical models developed at the Liggins Institute have been invaluable in providing empirical evidence to support the programming hypothesis and increasing our understanding of the mechanisms involved and potential strategies for intervention.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is Professor Frank Bloomfield<br>and I write to the ligand Institute and<br>it's my real pleasure to welcome you to<br>this evenings in oval lecture or<br>professor mark because before we get<br>underway just a few housekeeping<br>announcements<br>could you please all turn your phones to<br>silent or turning off bathrooms if you<br>should meet them outside across the<br>foyer or down the corridor and should<br>there be an emergency the red lights<br>will flash and silence will go off and<br>we should all meet outside and in the<br>quarter please so the annual inaugural<br>lecture series is an opportunity for the<br>university to showcase its new<br>professors and this is of course the<br>highest rank of the University and an<br>honor well worth celebrating and this<br>evening of course we're here for the<br>inaugural lecture of professor Marc<br>Vickers an accidental journey journey<br>into developmental programming so<br>professor Vickers has elected to deliver<br>his lecture in his academic regalia this<br>evening I mean that I had to wear mine<br>also and this mode map arel dates back<br>to the late 11th early 12th century when<br>all of the academics of course were<br>members of scholastic or monastic orders<br>and in those days the copes were<br>completely closed so that they couldn't<br>show off the finery of their clothes and<br>could maintain their modesty but in the<br>time of Henry the eighth that as<br>academic robes became more formalized<br>that fell by the wayside and robes<br>became open precisely so that people<br>could show off their finery and we'll<br>see that from festivities this evening<br>so the robes of the University of<br>Auckland are based largely on those of<br>the universities of Cambridge and Oxford<br>and the introduction of specific colors<br>for specific degrees is actually quite<br>late that invention only the last couple<br>of hundred years so professor Vickers<br>career actually in science started when<br>he took on the role of a research<br>assistant<br>in the research center for developmental<br>medicine and biology the precursor of<br>the ligands Institute really which was<br>in the department of pediatrics under<br>the supervision of Professor Bernhardt<br>Breyer and Mark work worked for been hot<br>for three years before going on his OE<br>to Germany and then returning back to do<br>a master's and then a PhD under the<br>supervision of Bernhardt and so Peter<br>Blackman and I'd really like to welcome<br>professor bent out Breyer back to the<br>ligands Institute it's great to have you<br>here this evening<br>Bernhard so marks PhD was awarded the<br>best doctoral thesis at the University<br>of Auckland perhaps not surprising when<br>the first publication from his PhD was<br>published in the American Journal of<br>physiology and resulted in a paradigm<br>shift in the field of the developmental<br>origins of adult disease it's been cited<br>almost a thousand times with the most<br>cited paper of the decade in the<br>American Journal of physiology and it<br>reported the effects of the post natal<br>amplification of a prenatal phenotype<br>with post natal diet and I think it's<br>fair to say that the images of mark<br>Vickers fat and lazy rats has been<br>flashed up on conference screens around<br>the world not always by mark subsequent<br>to his PhD he continued his research at<br>the University of Auckland and undertook<br>research into interventions to try and<br>reverse these adverse effects of the<br>entry to an environment and this<br>resulted in the award of the Hamilton<br>prize which is a very prestigious award<br>from the Royal Society for a really<br>seminal paper by an early career<br>researcher so in his career to date<br>professor mark Vickers has published<br>over 130 peer-reviewed articles and<br>sixteen book chapters presented its work<br>widely in international conferences and<br>has numerous international<br>collaborations and his work of course<br>fits perfectly with the work the ligands<br>Institute into how the alterations in<br>early life environment can lead to<br>increased risk for development of<br>metabolic and cardiovascular disease<br>later in life so professor Vickers is<br>going to tell us today about how his<br>research has provided invaluable<br>empirical evidence to support the<br>metal origins of health and disease<br>paradigm and although that was initially<br>treated skeptically by many not Marx<br>research of course but the hypothesis in<br>general I think the contribution that is<br>made has meant that has now become<br>firmly established as an important<br>mechanism so mark we're looking forward<br>to hearing about your unexpected journey<br>into the field thank you very much thank<br>for that wonderful introduction so I've<br>been around for a long time as many of<br>you made yes<br>I've stuck to a good thing I've had a<br>had a good formula and I've been very<br>well mean tilden supervisor over my<br>career so I never actually saw the need<br>to leave what is now the Liggins<br>Institute and hopefully I'm around for a<br>while to go yes as well so he looked<br>back at my university entrance this is<br>to prove that I used to have here making<br>the old days if you look at where I<br>started back in school I wasn't heading<br>towards a sort of a science background<br>that will whereof ended up now so I was<br>doing the arts types of Lexie English<br>economics geography history and so forth<br>so I sort of fell into this by accident<br>so a lot of you who know me will know<br>how it got into this role through our<br>Bernard Brahe who I basically own my<br>whole career to basically so thank you<br>again Burnett for being here today<br>this by alacra I landed on your disc and<br>I think this is why I was single for so<br>long<br>so basically hey there's streets painted<br>all fall out doing a PhD so I start off<br>with my BSC in geography because I did<br>geography course it was a subject I<br>liked I was one of those suckers at the<br>time who fell into a subject I liked so<br>I carried it through the university but<br>there aren't many options available with<br>with geography so I had a bit of a brick<br>wall<br>so I was there I was actually unemployed<br>for a period of time and then I fell<br>into a government work scheme whereby<br>they placed people and I was managed to<br>get a position with Bernard Bryant and<br>then I worked as a technical assistant<br>at part of Pediatrics for a while for<br>three years and also through Bernard<br>Breyer he found me a contact in Germany<br>through doctor Verna bloom I'll talk<br>about in a minute so win over the<br>Germany and worked as a technical<br>assistant at the Children's Hospital in<br>Germany I saw a there are two three<br>years in to begin which is us that sort<br>of stood carrot and then I spent about a<br>year industry for physiology as a stat<br>side of Munich so I had a great time<br>overseas and then I'd got the bug about<br>research so I decided to come back and<br>then follow my research interest so I<br>came back to Auckland and once again<br>through support from Bernadin neglect<br>when I managed to get into a master's of<br>science and medical science which I did<br>in reproductive biology and then I<br>passed on to went on to do a PhD in<br>pediatrics<br>so all under the guidance and leadership<br>of Bernhard Breyer so here's a picture<br>up here of Bernhard in the old days and<br>I think that's Peter Gluckman<br>it isn't yeah so these jumpers wouldn't<br>have gone amiss from the the midwinter<br>party we had this year at the ligands so<br>that's where I started off it's my first<br>lab this their Research Center for<br>developmental medicine neurology and I<br>went to work for dr. Verna bloom who was<br>very very well noted in the growth<br>hormone igf-1 area and also professor<br>micro ranky who many of you may know as<br>well in the growth of in biology area so<br>I was very lucky to get a position at a<br>hospital in Germany and we know Germany<br>not speaking a word of German so this<br>fell into this position luckily<br>everything and then the lab there was in<br>English so it all worked out quite well<br>and after after German tubing in here I<br>moved on to the lab doctor<br>Alvis Alvin and I did some sort of large<br>animal stuff looking for either BST and<br>so forth in in cows and where I work<br>there also happened to be the home of<br>the oldest brewery in the world so it<br>actually fall into into almost a perfect<br>work environment there and I was also<br>only a couple of train stops away from<br>the Munich Oktoberfest so that was great<br>but at some point that fund had to stop<br>so what I did here is I spent a lot of<br>time sitting up ready of many ways and<br>so forth and that I've learned how to do<br>back and Bernhard's lab so come back to<br>Auckland got serious and did my other<br>degrees but while I was in the lab over<br>in Germany I did pick up the bag for<br>doing research and I did manage to get a<br>co-author ship on a couple of papers we<br>looked at old methods like FPR see<br>looking at nephrotic syndrome and these<br>kids but when I started in Berners there<br>was actually completely lab naive I'd<br>never been there before I made a few<br>mistakes so I don't even think burn and<br>those about a classic one was doing free<br>fatty acid sa is the old way with it yet<br>to shape the tubes manually and I use<br>the wrong kind of tubes and came back<br>after lunch and they'd all melt it all<br>over there the lab bench quickly kind of<br>hide those away but what I did learn<br>back then was attention to detail if<br>somebody told you a protocol that says<br>shake for five minutes you shook for<br>five minutes you didn't try and take a<br>short gun do three or three and a half<br>because I lit the hard way that things<br>don't work if you don't follow detail<br>and that's an aspect of my career that I<br>followed through to all my animal<br>studies and so forth to make sure they<br>were designed to the enth degree so I<br>did my PhD thesis with Bernhard Brier<br>along with a couple of a neurologist<br>Curtis Kravitz and Patrick Casey and we<br>looked at the effect of growth of an<br>igf-1 on sperm characteristics so<br>primarily the effect of growth of an<br>igf-1 on sperm motility<br>sperm morphology and so forth as well<br>and obviously there was a highly<br>successful projects who managed to get<br>five papers out of my master's project<br>so I knew I was actually working in the<br>research environment was going to<br>nurture me through my PhD studies so<br>that was a great introduction to<br>postgraduate study so then I fell into<br>this era development of programming so<br>about the time I finished my master's<br>work there was<br>a lot of burgeoning interest in this<br>whole their idea of fetal origins of<br>adult disease or Foe it as it was called<br>at the time and the definition of that<br>most of you new audience will know a<br>stimulus or insult operating in a<br>critical or sensitive period of<br>development that results in the<br>long-standing effect on the structure or<br>function on the organism so I moved away<br>from the sort of a neurology the sperm<br>work and wanted to get into this whole<br>idea of what happened in the early life<br>environment dictated largely what<br>happened in later life and david baca<br>who sort of popularized this work i was<br>what's enough to meet there was quite a<br>few times during my career and he knew<br>what we're doing back here in Auckland<br>and the oil always had some constructive<br>advice on how you should be looking at<br>this it should be looking at that so I<br>was very fortunate to meet the person<br>who actually popularized the science on<br>a number of occasions and this is one of<br>the prime examples of the work that<br>David Barker did in the early days<br>showing the link between birth weight<br>and impaired glucose tolerance so as<br>birth weight goes down when peak glucose<br>tolerance ink goes up back in these days<br>it was a heavy emphasis on on birth<br>weight the birth weight is just a proxy<br>for a programming phenomenon and we also<br>know there's a kick in the tail here so<br>we know at the other end of this birth<br>weight spectrum B is also problems in<br>terms of macrosomia and large babies as<br>well so programming over the years<br>initially it was met with some<br>skepticism<br>now people didn't believe how important<br>that early life environment wasn't they<br>couldn't believe believe that such an<br>early life environment dictated such a<br>large degree of later disease but<br>obviously as we know programming has<br>become a major area of science<br>internationally it's been popularized in<br>the press such as here and it's even<br>grown enough now to have its own journal<br>that a lot of us contribute to so in<br>terms of critical windows opportunity so<br>I'm going to talk about my journey into<br>setting up these models to provide<br>empirical data to support the<br>programming work and also how then we<br>went into doing intervention strategies<br>so now we have our genotype and we've<br>got our environment feeding into a<br>period whereby an early life where we<br>developmentally malleable we're plastic<br>so we're very very susceptible to the<br>cues we're picking up with external<br>environment<br>and the combination of these feeds into<br>our adult phenotype in this graph you've<br>seen many many times I think it's been<br>rejoined a lot of times as well but it<br>simply shows how important this early<br>life period is in terms of plasticity<br>and how it this is the optimal time to<br>intervene if you're going to we all hear<br>about these treatments for diabetes and<br>obesity in a their life and they're<br>largely ineffective so I concentrated my<br>most of my career on this period here we<br>have a the greatest chance of<br>intervening with some effect so the<br>earlier their intervention the bigger<br>the effect on later risk reduction so<br>what does determine a half potential we<br>know that what we eat and how active we<br>are feeds into disease risk we also know<br>what happens now in the early life<br>period provides the first tip the<br>primary hit then we have this sort of<br>one-two sort of second hit hypothesis so<br>one of the first studies we did which<br>I'll talk about in a minute was<br>combining early life adversity with post<br>natal high-fat nutrition and there<br>amplified the post natal phenotype and<br>where the ligands were the first group<br>internationally to do that and that kind<br>of approach now is used widely around<br>the world so we also know we have this<br>vicious cycle of disease you've got your<br>fat boy Ice Cream Sandwich and your<br>chocolate coated potato chips here so<br>you've got maternal undernutrition<br>I don't think we can buy these here this<br>is in the states so maternal adversity<br>it could be under nutrition we've done<br>both ends of the spectrum maternal ended<br>nutrition and paternal obesity and we<br>have to remember that maternal obesity<br>in itself can be a form of malnutrition<br>as well leading to altered fetal<br>neonatal nutrition feeds into this with<br>Daiya physical activity childhood<br>obesity and as we go around and around<br>we see this official cycle ensuing and<br>we need to break this cycle because as<br>we know from reports a couple weeks ago<br>New Zealand's actually now of the third<br>fattest country the OECD behind us a in<br>Mexico so the programming work we does<br>is a key element in breaking the cycle<br>across generations of disease and where<br>I came in with was animal models and<br>once again I was very naive I think my<br>experience with my first experience was<br>working with rats was with Sonya Woodall<br>who's also here<br>and I think it was just let loose in<br>Sonya's room there was no health and<br>safety no legislation training no<br>nothing here's a room there's some rats<br>in it<br>go and play that was it basically and I<br>think it suddenly came and saw me after<br>and said what did you do to those rats<br>remember that a long time ago now but<br>that was my introduction to working in<br>NMR models so preclinical models are a<br>key tool for the investigation of<br>mechanisms that underlie the early life<br>development of obesity and related<br>metabolic disorders so what actually can<br>be programmed oh I went in to make that<br>sorry their eyes came out first so what<br>actually kept me looked a bit sad if she<br>sorry so what actually gave me program<br>nearly every aspect of physiology we<br>looked at during my career anyway and<br>that with collaborators can be<br>programmed we've shown evidence of<br>altered cardiovascular system blood<br>pressure obesity we've done some work on<br>lying stress axes puberty polycystic<br>ovaries depression type disorders<br>inflammatory disorders changes insulin<br>sensitivity bone density glucose control<br>hepatic steatosis renal function nephron<br>deficit and unsurprisingly all these<br>things are perturbed that you get<br>reduced lifespan so we always have this<br>ethos of making the most of the animals<br>that we've used in their experiments as<br>well and either through our group<br>directly or through collaboration we've<br>looked at nearly every single aspect<br>from central down to the gonads and<br>through dip sobota we've done a lot of<br>work actually in the ovary as well as<br>showing altered ovarian aging and<br>reproductive disorders for example so<br>when we first started back with burners<br>in my PhD it was looking at maternal<br>undernutrition because that was at the<br>time that was what most people were<br>developing so models of maternal or<br>fetal growth restriction and it's very<br>easy to mimic this experimentally<br>obviously if you under narrows your<br>mother you get short lighter pups II see<br>quite significant growth restriction<br>here which mimics quite nicely that the<br>clinical setting of ieg are well what<br>happens is this pup here grows into this<br>one here and these guys are eating the<br>same diet these guys that has got a<br>programmed disorder a thrifty phenotype<br>they store energy for a rainy day but<br>that rainy day never comes so these guys<br>are eating the same food and what we did<br>then through the guidance of bernhard<br>briar we<br>coupled that with the postnatal high-fat<br>diet to amplify the phenotype and at<br>that time nobody had done that before<br>so did shows become some considerable<br>insight from as well and that was that<br>was the paper at the time fetal origins<br>of hyperphagia there's been zepa tight<br>disorders overeating obesity and<br>hypertension and postnatal amplification<br>by high perchloric nutrition as Frank<br>said there was the most cited paper of<br>the decade 2001 2011 and ajp it cited<br>almost a thousand times now and it was<br>the first study to use a high-fat diet<br>to implement any type and this approach<br>is actually now standard if you look at<br>the literature 99% of the papers you see<br>you'll see a programming model coupled<br>with a high-fat diet to amplify the<br>phenotype and you'll see another couple<br>of ligands authors here at the time<br>Wayne Cal Phil and Paul Hoffman<br>I think Paul T so you remember that<br>and this is just an example of some of<br>the data that so that came out of that<br>paper look at systolic blood pressure<br>fasting plasma insulin lifts these are<br>our control animals fed a standard diet<br>so dis offspring of a normal pregnancy<br>normal normally nourished mother blood<br>pressure's normal<br>you give them a high-fat diet blood<br>pressure goes up a bit as you'd expect<br>but this blue line here represents the<br>effect of the maternal nutritional<br>environment on offspring blood pressure<br>so the so called programming effect I<br>mean I don't like using the word<br>programming a lot but I've got a<br>alternative at the moment so you see<br>quite a marked programming effect so<br>these these animals become hypertensive<br>purely on the basis of what their mother<br>ate during pregnancy if you give them a<br>high-fat diet<br>you mplet phenotype even further and<br>very similar here for insulin maternal<br>diet makes your offspring<br>hyperinsulinemic air the high-fat diet<br>into the mix and they're even worse off<br>and as they age this sort of mismatch<br>I'll talk about in a minute actually<br>amplifies with age so the greater the<br>nutritional disparity between early life<br>and later life the greater the effect on<br>phenotype and also at this time we had<br>access to some pretty high-tech<br>equipment the time for looking at<br>locomotor activity so in these boxes<br>using an array of infrared beams we<br>could actually measure locomotor<br>activity in these animals and nobody<br>looked at the locomotor activity as a<br>consequence of programming before so we<br>put these animals in the spa<br>and looked at their activity and we were<br>the first to show the animals that were<br>born undernourished mothers actually had<br>reduced physical locomotor activity this<br>is voluntary locomotor activity and<br>concomitant with that they had increased<br>appetite so they were high pathetic and<br>lazy basically and if you had added a<br>high-fat diet into their mix you<br>amplified that phenotype so they became<br>very inactive and they spend a lot of<br>time into sitting around and eating and<br>we also show that this phenotype was<br>actually present as early as day 35 and<br>that's about two weeks after weaning<br>sort of very young age before the<br>presence of obesity these animals both<br>females here Mouse here we're showing<br>reduced physical activity levels so we'd<br>programmed this thrifty phenotype this<br>reduced locomotor activity and we<br>thought this was really exciting at the<br>time through actually for the first time<br>submitted this to science and I don't<br>know if you remember that some of the<br>communications around this bird and we<br>know it's a bit pissed off at the time<br>but that's life and I've learned to get<br>used to it now 20 years on but if you<br>see the editors feedback you will see<br>that the sets of comments are positive<br>and recommend publication after mine the<br>revision unfortunately we do not we<br>that's that's sort of the start of a<br>sort of sentence of death the guy did<br>not believe in program he said it's hard<br>to reconcile the effects of the early<br>life environment on later life outcomes<br>they even made us go away and do another<br>study and we actually went away into<br>debt and they still come back and if you<br>look at the nature of some of the<br>comments from the reviewers stunningly<br>important paper widespread influence and<br>endocrinology so we couldn't get him to<br>science despite a lot of chewing and<br>throwing with the editor so ended up<br>being in a JP I think it was again ends<br>up on the front page of the New Zealand<br>Herald born lazy blaming mother type of<br>thing so got a lot of widespread press<br>but what's annoying is it's been cited<br>about 300 in something times now but<br>it's also been cited a lot in science<br>and nature from people who've done<br>similar experiments a bit later on so he<br>may have this come along at the wrong<br>time to get that and because we also had<br>a sceptic in the in there and the editor<br>editor that we had at the time but<br>frustrating so if you want to kept cite<br>all the work we did on maternal<br>undernutrition<br>a few years work even kept in kept state<br>here and a lot of this work was derived<br>from some of the initial work that son<br>you had done<br>and a nutrition model and the rat as<br>well so it's good one thing that's<br>actually quite comforting is over the 20<br>years or so I've been doing rats and<br>I've even changed this the strain of<br>rates across the phenotype is as<br>consistent as ever I can predict what<br>the blood pressure will be and the<br>environment I've put these animals so it<br>shows the stability of these animals<br>over time if you look at this range of<br>outcomes here offspring of control<br>pregnancies here offspring of mothers<br>that were undernourished you can see for<br>every aspect of what we looked at here<br>there's a marked perturbation in their<br>program phenotype and each one of these<br>is actually worsened in the presence of<br>a high-fat diet high blood pressure<br>hyperendemic leptin resistant fat<br>hyperphagia increasing peptide lazy and<br>they've even got reduced rectal<br>temperatures as well and together with<br>some work that and Byrne instigated<br>along with them Michael Davidson and<br>Jason Landon we even looked at some<br>measures outside of our typical<br>phenotype measures and we looked at some<br>learning and we also showed that<br>offspring of undernourished mothers had<br>quite significant learning deficits so<br>in addition to all the basic phenotype<br>we looked at in terms of adiposity and<br>diabetes and leptin resistance related<br>matters we also showed that they had<br>learning deficits which is very similar<br>to what is seen in some clinical<br>scenarios as well around SGA and so<br>forth this is what I was talking about<br>nutritional mismatch this double pit I<br>showed you for about this double hit<br>there in utero environment and the<br>postnatal environment creating this<br>double hit and this is a book that<br>people collect on the markets and put<br>that a few years ago now called mismatch<br>well this is an example that's used<br>quite widely and that's plasma leptin so<br>once again you have got offspring of<br>control animal pregnancies here<br>undernourished pregnancies here these<br>guys are eating the same diet but you<br>see there's a there's an increase in in<br>liptint as a result of programming but<br>if you put these animals that were born<br>to an undernourished mother on a<br>high-fat diet you see this miss of<br>increment in the amplification of<br>circulating leptin levels so the greater<br>the nutritional mismatch the greater the<br>effect on later phenotype and this is<br>what's typically seen are things such as<br>nutrition transitions and rural-urban<br>migration 'z<br>where people are moving into the cities<br>with the getting access to western-style<br>diets they may<br>been born in an area relatively<br>impoverished but they've actually then<br>moved into a region with this plentiful<br>supply of western-style diets and that's<br>when you get this explosion of diabetes<br>and obesity but in the field change we<br>started putting grants into HR Co so<br>forth and under nutrition wasn't an<br>issue they didn't like them the models<br>of undernutrition the rodent and a more<br>pressing problem at the time was that of<br>the increasing rates of maternal obesity<br>so he went away and similar to the<br>undernutrition models we went away and<br>developed some models of maternal<br>obesity using quite moderate high-fat<br>diets throughout pregnancy and lactation<br>once again offspring of a controlled<br>pregnancy offspring of a mother that was<br>fit a high-fat diet through pregnancy<br>and lactation once again eating the same<br>child diet this guy's developed a marked<br>and profound phenotype related to<br>hyperphagia and obesity leptin<br>resistance and so forth and the results<br>are quite similar for both genders so<br>was quite easy to set up another animal<br>model looking at maternal - feeding on<br>offspring phenotype and if you want to<br>look at some of their sort of more broad<br>phenotypic outcomes look at body fat as<br>assessed by Dixie scan offspring of<br>controlled pregnancies offspring of<br>obese pregnancies see a marked increase<br>in body fat remember these guys are<br>eating the same diet postnatally and you<br>can see if you look at their just their<br>body weight growth curves<br>there's a map divergence and body weight<br>and those offspring who are born to high<br>fat feed mothers and not unsurprisingly<br>they've got high leptin levels and high<br>insulin levels as well and we've started<br>looking at some of the mechanistic basis<br>I'm looking at taste receptors so we<br>even found programming effects and this<br>was also reported for the first time of<br>some work we did with Stephanie Segovia<br>and Claire Reynolds<br>looking at the gut taste receptors so<br>even the gut taste receptor expression<br>is different and offspring that are born<br>to obese mothers and that's going to<br>influence a glucose sensing and so forth<br>as well and when we give these guys a<br>food choice protocol so we in the cage<br>would give them free access to whatever<br>food they want to make whatever diet<br>they want to eat whether it's the high<br>fat or the jail whatever offspring of<br>obesogenic feed mother's always select<br>the wrong food that unhealthy food nine<br>times out of ten they'll go for the -<br>obesogenic diet and if you look at their<br>weight gain over just even a 10 day<br>period you'll see that the offspring of<br>obese mothers via selecting the wrong<br>type of food show a marked increment in<br>their body weight gain over time and<br>that's just a picture of me having my<br>first beer I think showing altered thrus<br>preference and me and central adiposity<br>programming effect so we know that<br>maternal diet can program appetite<br>preferences offspring similar effects<br>have been shown by Mike Symons over in<br>the UK and has also been albeit limited<br>date from the Dutch famine cohort<br>showing that the offspring in the Dutch<br>famine cohort have a preference for<br>fatty foods so once again we can<br>reconcile some of the animal work we've<br>done with some clinical outcomes or<br>epidemiological outcomes and also when<br>dips the voter will see we looked in the<br>literature so there's a lot of people<br>saying to work on high-fat high-sugar<br>type diets but nobody had really looked<br>at the effect of maternal sugar intake<br>in isolation on maternal outcomes so we<br>did quite a simple study where we gave<br>the equivalent of 2 cans of soda a day<br>so not a lot so that 20% of their<br>calories was derived from soda via via<br>fructose in these mothers and what<br>happened even this is one marker that<br>came out of it at birth and the<br>offspring they were already showing<br>signs of hyperlipidemia so this really<br>moderate intake of fructose by the<br>mothers during pregnancy<br>led to this programming of leptin<br>resistance in his animals I can't recall<br>a lift in the resistance so it's because<br>we didn't call it we didn't challenge<br>them but hyperlipidemia I should say so<br>they're already kind of hardwired to<br>fail in early life based on what the<br>mother had consumed you're in pregnancy<br>so a maternal fructose intake resulted<br>in increases in the BC rated hormones<br>and offspring at birth and this is<br>really exciting it got into in depend on<br>G and a follow up paper and plus looking<br>at some of the mechanisms but when the<br>press got wind of it there was a classic<br>example of we not to talk to the press<br>especially when one of the authors were<br>sitting in a bar in Mount Eden at the<br>time so this made the front page of The<br>Herald we've got the front pages here<br>for the second time and the basic<br>headline was pregnant women should not<br>eat fruit and the sounds funny but did a<br>lot of damage and people were very<br>serious about it and some of conditions<br>we had had<br>people coming and saying we were told<br>not to eat fruit because it contains<br>fructose so fruit juice apples linked to<br>fetus harm fruit fructose could harm<br>babies what was the other one<br>why pregnant rat should avoid apples ooh<br>some really weird lines that came out<br>but but it was quite serious because the<br>whole entire message have got wrong<br>fruit contains fructose thereby thereby<br>fructose is bad so we did a lot of<br>damage control I'm trying to trying to<br>educate people around what we mean by<br>the fructose we'd use in terms it was a<br>highly refined crystalline fructose high<br>fructose corn syrup for example but this<br>shows how a simple story can get<br>completely messed up in the press so we<br>set up these nice molds of Programming<br>there was no doubt that programming<br>occurred if you've nipple aided the<br>maternal environment you had an adverse<br>outcome and the offspring so we wanted<br>to see if with a week of reverse<br>programming and there was little done in<br>this field as well you see it from our<br>career a lot of the work of the ligands<br>we seem to be just ahead of the game all<br>the time in terms of our sort of<br>innovative thinking there were some<br>early work done on taurine back a couple<br>of decades ago looking at low protein<br>model but nobody really looked at<br>reversing agents and most people have<br>thought that developmental program amid<br>- a sort of a permanent change in<br>developmental trajectory so we started<br>looking at reversal agents in our lab so<br>yes we can reverse programming and we've<br>done at least an animal model there's a<br>caveat so we've done a lot of reversal<br>agents here I mean over the career<br>who've actually done quite a lot and<br>this doesn't list all of them so leptin<br>growth hormone igf-1 choline and supreme<br>oxidants in sensitizer taurine omega-3<br>CLA with the theory knows prevention of<br>catch-up growth and even more recently<br>we've done some insulin so we've done a<br>lot of agents that do effectively<br>reverse some of these programming<br>effects and I'll take you through a few<br>sort of key examples from these so the<br>first thing we did was leptin we know<br>these animals display signs of leptin<br>resistance and later life and we know<br>that hypo lipped anemic at birth<br>we'd also showed it's more work with am<br>Shiva patina at Karachi of one of the<br>students in a group and Bernhard<br>back in 2001 that the link between<br>Lipton insulin was perturbed as a result<br>of developmental programming you look at<br>these slides here of islets from the<br>pancreas you can see the islet from a<br>control offspring from a control<br>pregnancy offsprings one denars<br>pregnancy<br>is this an example of the dysregulation<br>the brown staining is for Lipton on the<br>periphery of the islets so we knew that<br>the adipose Alexus in these animals was<br>perturbed and we thought what if we<br>replace leptin in the early life pair<br>and see if we can rescue this phenotype<br>and at around the same time Sebastian<br>beret had looked at the ob/ob Mouse<br>which is a leptin deficient mouse model<br>and show that if he replaced leptin an<br>earlier period he could also rescue the<br>phenotype and that genetic model so we<br>did it quite a simple study using our<br>model of undernutrition and the rat once<br>again you can see quite a few leptin I<br>mean ligands authors up theory as well<br>so we gave them 10 days with a leptin<br>treatment in the neonatal period and<br>followed them up postnatally and as you<br>can see offspring born to undernourished<br>mothers that's got fatter and heavier<br>over time there to show this completely<br>everand growth profile and it was kept<br>laying down fed and so forth but in the<br>undernourished offspring that we gave<br>leptin to we completely normalized their<br>phenotype this is in females it's<br>important for a point offering up later<br>and in this case leptin treatment to<br>normal offspring of normal pregnancies<br>had no effect and every aspect of their<br>phenotype that we looked at whether it<br>was fat mass blood pressure insulin<br>leptin was completely normalized in<br>these animals and we appeared to reset<br>this phenotype through this early life<br>intervention so we completely restored<br>their postnatal growth patterns and<br>physiology and that led to quite a range<br>of papers that came out of there even<br>some stuff ground weights in the<br>audience here I mentioned that paper<br>later on even modeling some of the data<br>and through collaboration we had a lot<br>of in-depth work done on this through<br>University of Cambridge University of<br>Southampton as well and it shows a pair<br>of having a good animal cohort Bank<br>because together<br>Alvin Firth and dual-core nursery she<br>published a paper and a couple weeks ago<br>in this cohort which was generated back<br>in about 2005 so we've stored samples<br>from a precious cohort and are still<br>milking it basically and based on my<br>Master's work I had this interest in<br>growth or one no gf1<br>and we know from some of the work there<br>Sonya and Byrne had done the early days<br>that the growth of an igf-1 axis was<br>also perturbed in this early life<br>environment so the first study we did<br>was look at adult igf-1 treatment we've<br>also done adult growth hormone<br>treatments you see the titles the papers<br>down here you know like<br>before offspring of undernourished<br>mothers are hypertensive high blood<br>pressure but if you give them a GF one<br>you can actually lead to a marked<br>decrease in blood pressure so we've got<br>about 20% decrease in blood pressure so<br>normalize your blood pressure as a<br>result of IGF treatment and growth<br>hormone treatment to adults showed a<br>very similar effect but like I was<br>saying before this period of life<br>they're not actually that plastic so we<br>wanted to go back and see if we could<br>actually look during this critical<br>period of plasticity whether we could<br>intervene back then with components of<br>the growth hormone system so together<br>with people like clear Reynolds and dr.<br>Clint gray we did a pre weaning growth<br>or min treatment paradigm very similar<br>to the leptin one we've done and looked<br>at the offspring phenotype and later<br>life so as you can see once again we see<br>an increase in blood pressure as a<br>result of this programming phenomenon<br>increase in fat mass we also see a<br>pro-inflammatory phenotype this is il-1<br>beta as an example and this is around a<br>150 of age an adult life but you can see<br>that the animals we exposed a growth<br>hormone during that first period of life<br>have got a completely resolved phenotype<br>in adulthood and a lot of the features<br>we looked at whether was in the failure<br>dysfunction ventricular hypertrophy bone<br>marrow micro files information adipose<br>tissue insulin resistance we managed to<br>restore all of these features with<br>neonatal growth growth or min exposure<br>and this work got into a couple of<br>papers and also got a editorial feature<br>in the journal endocrinology which is<br>quite a an accolade for the work and I<br>can't go through all the interventions<br>we've done there is a caveat to a lot of<br>interventions we've tried they work<br>extremely well in the setting of<br>programming but they can have adverse<br>consequences if you test them in the<br>setting of a normal pregnancy so we've<br>done taurine methyl donors such as<br>choline folic acid with clear we've done<br>CLA conjugated linoleic acid fish all<br>have been Albert and also some more<br>recent work with Alan Firth and along<br>with Justin O'Sullivan as well so here's<br>an example of Motoring supplementation<br>there was an old literature<br>back in the 80s about giving taurine in<br>the drinking water to offspring of low<br>protein food mothers and it seemed to<br>restore the pancreatic phenotype and<br>those animals and there's also some<br>evidence that taurine can restore<br>instance in civet e in animals that are<br>fed<br>in normal non-pregnant animals theater a<br>high sugar diet so we went back to our<br>model of maternal fructose intake and as<br>you can see here mums that consumed<br>fructose during pregnancy become hyper<br>and cinnamic inflammatory profile and<br>they even show a max tour scores relates<br>to the hepatic steatosis so the liver is<br>actually quite damaged as well two of<br>those fructose even though it's only<br>between 20% load but relative to calorie<br>intake but when we put some taurine in<br>their drinking water<br>we completely rescued you all these<br>effects so we indicated this these<br>adverse effects of torreón<br>supplementation so it's quite exciting<br>data as well and similarly with<br>conjugated linoleic acid which is a<br>compound which has found a lot of meat<br>and dairy which is high in a lot of the<br>meat and dairy found in New Zealand if<br>you look at maternal insulin sensitivity<br>on the left here you can see that a<br>high-fat diet during pregnancy leads to<br>a change of maternal insulin sensitivity<br>if CLA is added to the diet we can<br>rescue that phenotype and also not this<br>paternal health but if you look at the<br>offspring once again we looked at the<br>gasp inflammatory profile here you see a<br>marked increase in TNF alpha and the gut<br>as a result of maternal high-fat diet<br>but once again CLA as a supplement in<br>the diet can restore that phenotype but<br>the caveat is that one size does not fit<br>all and the potential is there<br>interventions in the sitting of intake<br>systems may actually to adverse outcomes<br>and we've shown that for taurine for<br>example if you give taurine to a normal<br>pretty mother it can actually have an<br>increase in neonatal mortality that may<br>be due to hypoglycemic effects we don't<br>know the trouble is the old literature<br>which is a trouble with the animal<br>research field in itself a lot of people<br>don't give the intervention to a control<br>group so they have unbalanced study<br>designs and that's a point we'll come to<br>in a minute as well so leading on from<br>our work and given that programming can<br>actually happen at any birth weight or<br>across the spectrum as a continuum it's<br>how best to identify those at risk of<br>program disorders a tailored approach<br>use of metabolic markers for example and<br>we know that for example from our leptin<br>work that the effects of neonatal<br>heparin treatment are actually dependent<br>upon prior maternal nutritional status<br>and gender where she did a follow-up<br>paper using male neonates that were<br>treated and we showed that leptin<br>treatment to male knee and acts of<br>normal pregnancies can actually elicit<br>add various metabolic phenotype and at<br>the time we were doing ellipse and<br>worked through a few other groups in the<br>UK in particular who were doing some<br>maternal offspring our Lipton studies<br>and they actually thought about adding<br>Lipton to infant formula as a sort of a<br>panacea to curb obesity and they're<br>actually quite serious about at a time<br>but we know that would have been<br>disastrous if anybody'd ever taken it<br>seriously and another thing which is<br>overlooked and the NIH is coming down<br>particularly hard on this if you don't<br>look at six specific effects and grants<br>that are submitted the NIH for example<br>they'll ask for a reason why I said a<br>lot of people who set up programming<br>models looked at the the male and female<br>looked at the the phenotypes that<br>emerged and chose the one that best<br>suited their needs where sometimes the<br>lack of a phenotype versus a phenotype<br>is obviously very very informative in<br>terms of mechanisms and the old sort of<br>editor you can't use females because we<br>try to avoid the confounds of e stress<br>which is something I used early in my<br>career this is not able to be used<br>anymore so we're possible we should<br>always look at the effect of male versus<br>female and sexual dimorphism in<br>programming and here's a clear example<br>here if you look at the percentage from<br>males centers from females look at some<br>of these inflammatory markers you'll see<br>there's a very distinct and apparently<br>profile and the male centers but nothing<br>at all in the females so those studies<br>where they've actually discounted six<br>and they she merged the data you can see<br>why they get a lot of noise and what<br>about the father<br>a lot of work was actually put towards<br>the father the mother as being sort of<br>where the blame should go but there's an<br>increasing evidence about the role of<br>the dead in the program disorders some a<br>lot of this work was kicked off some<br>work by am Margaret Morris back 2010<br>where they gave a chronic high-fat diet<br>in a mouse model rep model and they show<br>that they could program beta cell<br>dysfunction the female offspring but<br>since then there's been dozens of papers<br>showing<br>transmission of these programming<br>affixed through the paternal lineage as<br>well and of course one of the benefits<br>of using animal models is that we can<br>very easily look at transgenerational<br>effects a lot of people use the term<br>trans generation and when they're<br>looking at F 2 but if 2 is not strictly<br>transgenerational because<br>simply reflects an impact of the initial<br>environmental insult to the mother so<br>for true transgenerational work you have<br>to go to f3 and beyond and with the rat<br>and mouse models you can do that quite<br>easily so it's one of the powers of the<br>small animal models and can we actually<br>model it yes we can so some of the data<br>went to fish a gram wake who's here<br>somewhere and I've got to be honest this<br>is the only paper I've ever been a<br>co-author on that I don't understand any<br>of it but I'd assign the authorship form<br>and that was as far as it went but we at<br>the dynamics of our leptin system how<br>that did reversal work we can actually<br>model and I'm led to believe these<br>formulas sort of lead to that conclusion<br>at the end but so I've had to take your<br>word for it<br>so we can model the dynamic systems that<br>result from some of their experiments as<br>well but our research doesn't all go to<br>the planners I've shown you some studies<br>that we've done over the years which<br>I've actually worked out perfectly we've<br>developed nice phenotypes we've reversed<br>but back in the old days we did some<br>studies a lot of studies actually which<br>haven't even been published and poor<br>done if remember one of these ones with<br>gorillas own which was one of the<br>instance sensitizers on the market at<br>the time a tease ad it was being taken<br>by thousands upon thousands of people<br>around the world as an instant<br>sensitizer one of the side effects of<br>growth hormone treatment is diabetes<br>genetic effects so the the animals<br>they've got the growth hormone treatment<br>show it increased some players for<br>instant concentrations so we thought<br>we'll give the growth hormone plus this<br>Vincent sensitize it was on the market<br>at the time FDA approved and worked<br>extremely well at normalizing their<br>insulin sensitivity but when we opened<br>up these animals it was all liver all<br>you could see was liver there were four<br>or five times the size they should be<br>and this was a drug that was on the<br>market at the time and abettor Tommy she<br>finished our animal study and there was<br>about 63 liver failure related deaths in<br>the US and in 2004 about time we did<br>some of this work Pfizer set aside about<br>a year's a billion dollars to cover the<br>lawsuits so we were testing a drug for<br>any for we believed to be approved but<br>it had quite disastrous effects in these<br>animals so we don't know how she got<br>through to that stage and given to so<br>many people because he effects on the<br>animals in terms of herpetic and<br>enlargement was<br>the biggest I've ever seen in my career<br>and things have changed since I started<br>as well so back in 2000 burn I don't<br>know if you remember that all those days<br>that Stephan and ice were in that little<br>room with our little Breville kitchen<br>was making diets 10 to 15 kilos a day<br>absolutely no health and safety<br>regulations at the time but now switch<br>forward to 2017 you can go online order<br>you die 25 kilos press a button but our<br>new problem is now that syquest is no so<br>maybe easier to go back might be easy to<br>go back to the stage here but it's very<br>very easy to get commercially available<br>research diets now and the good thing is<br>about these diets they're open source so<br>you know over a 10-year period I'm not<br>going to change you can you can get<br>batch to batch consistency and that<br>makes a big difference when you're<br>planning long term studies and another<br>big thing that's happened over the last<br>few years is so cool arrived guidelines<br>because there have been hundreds upon<br>hundreds of papers that have shown<br>beneficial effects of intervention<br>agents and animal models but a lot of<br>them we've done poorly they've been done<br>using unbalanced study designs you can't<br>look at the papers and get much detail<br>about how they've actually undertaken<br>the work so a lot of journals now are<br>actually signing up for these arrive<br>guidelines whereby they want animal<br>studies to be signed very much more like<br>clinical studies so balanced<br>experimental designs use of both sexes<br>controlled well for example and I think<br>that's going to really improve the<br>quality and relevance of animal models<br>to the clinical setting because there is<br>that barrier of translation so we're -<br>from here so I said we've done all these<br>animal models we've we've we've proven<br>that we can reverse programming so we<br>need to take the next step in terms of<br>either education or interventions in the<br>clinic<br>so the one thing that sort of is funny<br>in my career there's back here which I<br>think we can't see the date this is 1997<br>when I first got my walle scholarship to<br>start my PhD and that's what the<br>hospital kind of looked like back then I<br>don't know what was this a Wallis block<br>I came in board it was nothing has<br>changed I was giving a talk back here on<br>the importance of early life nutrition<br>and I give talks now on the importance<br>of<br>Patricia maybe I'm just really really<br>about it but people come up to me after<br>after talk especially when you go to GP<br>conference they go that makes so much<br>sense I've never heard of don't hit<br>before so that they're on board wants to<br>hear about it but we haven't maybe<br>communicated this idea well enough over<br>the years so it comes down to this<br>effective translation of research<br>knowledge I've started here I've done<br>quite a bit of work at this in now but<br>we haven't managed to effectively<br>translate any of our intervention<br>strategies to any clinical scenario yet<br>mainly based on the do no harm<br>philosophy because most of interventions<br>we've shown do not work in every setting<br>so more work is required and I'm also<br>been very fortunate to work with an<br>early life nutrition coalition which is<br>a panel of experts across Australia New<br>Zealand and over the years we've<br>actually managed to get some statement<br>papers out we've also put together some<br>resources which go into the bounty packs<br>in the hospitals here so tens of<br>thousands of women have received these<br>little books which give guidance to<br>optimizing nutrition during the first<br>thousand years and later in the year I<br>think we've got an official launch in<br>Canberra of an advert which I'll play my<br>generation may not be as healthy or live<br>as long as those in the past and it's<br>the first thousand days of life that can<br>make all the difference here's what<br>parents can do eat well and maintain a<br>healthy weight<br>especially during pregnancy breastfeed<br>for as long as possible<br>introduce solid foods but not before<br>four months we learn from you early on<br>it's gonna be an Australian New Zealand<br>there's two versions of the ideas an<br>Australian version with a slightly<br>different accent and one that was new<br>so I'm very lucky to be sort of involved<br>where I can actually look at some of the<br>work I've done in the enema Wallace of<br>basic science and actually try and help<br>and inform than some of the other end of<br>the spectrum so I'm very privileged to<br>be involved in some of those coalition<br>and another thing we've done is we<br>actually translated some of the<br>research technologies we've used so for<br>example with some work we did with dr.<br>Trent gray who's now left elegans we<br>looked at micro RNA profiles in our<br>model of undernutrition and showed quite<br>specific micro RNA signatures and the<br>offspring of undernourished mothers<br>which link quite nicely to the<br>ventricular hypertrophy and the blood<br>pressure we saw so we thought all do<br>these micro RNAs have utility as<br>biomarkers and clinical samples so<br>luckily we had access to scope samples<br>through Lisa McGowan and we looked at<br>micro RNA profiles in maternal plasma in<br>20 week pregnancy samples so this is 8<br>to 12 weeks prior to actual events these<br>are women who went on later to have a<br>spontaneous preterm birth at 28 to 32<br>weeks and what we found is at 20 weeks<br>we could pick up very very specific<br>micro RNA signatures I mean there's no<br>overlap in that group at all so that<br>sort of informs that those marker and as<br>we picked up and this this related to a<br>cluster of micro RNAs the 5 for 8 family<br>may be very early and very sensitive and<br>very specific marker for later preterm<br>birth and you can see some individual<br>micro RNAs here we saw here no presence<br>at all in the pre terms and it's got a<br>lot of press at the time but now we have<br>to go back and validate they're in<br>independent cohorts and a wider<br>experimental sample as well so it's just<br>an example of sometimes how we can<br>translate a bench our platform we're<br>using into a clinical clinical revelant<br>model so it's quite exciting at the<br>moment Rachna patel in our group is<br>looking at the 15-week samples from this<br>cohort as well and also together with<br>our Jackie Bay and and her group we're<br>also looking at some translation of doe<br>head into some of the small island<br>developing sort of states so we've done<br>a lot of work over in the Cook Islands<br>in particular where there's no evidence<br>for doe hair kisser I mean there's a lot<br>of work linking early life events with<br>later outcomes but none of us has work<br>has been done in some of these<br>developing nations at all and sometimes<br>it's hampered by lower experimental<br>power so we're doing some work in the<br>Cook Islands you can see here in<br>adolescence you can already see at ages<br>13 14 75 60 percent respectively amount<br>females are either overweight or obese<br>so this is a population we're 91 percent<br>of the adult population is overweight or<br>obese and you can see what adolescents<br>are probably the key window of<br>opportunity to say the next set of<br>parents<br>so we're going in into the Cook Islands<br>and we're actually doing checks on these<br>kids you can see a blood pressure here<br>we're doing glucose measurements suresh<br>informing and educating the adolescents<br>about their own health profiles but<br>we're also doing at the same time as<br>we're actually going back to Rarotonga<br>hospital and linking these outcomes<br>their BMI and so forth with the birth of<br>strict registries to see if there's any<br>early life influences on their later<br>life health so we're doing go head but<br>it's in a smaller island context and of<br>course over my career if your father's<br>not happy it's probably cuz I couldn't<br>find it there's a lot of people that got<br>to think I mean obviously Bernhard<br>Breyer and Peter Gluckman for actually<br>giving me a start if I hadn't walked<br>into that door there's an unemployed<br>person I don't know where I'd be now<br>this all worked out rather well I think<br>in the end but also I've been very<br>privileged the range of students Ellis<br>is my first PhD student I think she<br>there she is there and Alice is here<br>today so it's great to see you but a lot<br>of a range of students mentors and<br>colleagues and collaborators so it's<br>been a fantastic journey so far even<br>though I fell into it completely by<br>accident and also have to fund<br>collaborators have been around long<br>enough that I've actually got some<br>funding at some point an HRC MB I am a<br>RIF we've a couple of miles din grants<br>Callaghan a lot of funding in support<br>through gravida and we've also been<br>quite a bit of work for some commercial<br>entities such as Fonterra Pfizer and<br>Danone and also I've got to think the<br>long-suffering Emer and and and Lila who<br>put up with me sort of moaning on about<br>lack of funding but they know I'm an<br>optimist and things will always turn out<br>in the end so thank you very much for<br>listening<br>thank you very much much wonderful<br>journey through not only your career but<br>also that contribution you've made to<br>the field of developmental origins to<br>health and disease really advancing our<br>understanding of how some of these early<br>environmental effects affect postnatal<br>phenotype also how potentially may be<br>able to remedy those and great to see<br>that you're now that you've got a<br>professor you're managing to spend some<br>time in the ions so thank you very<br>much thank you okay that was a terrific<br>lecture<br>so that brings us to
