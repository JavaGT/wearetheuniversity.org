Auckland<br>Business School and it's my absolute<br>pleasure to welcome you here this<br>evening for for our short sharp event<br>and and just as a reminder this event is<br>brought to you of course by the<br>University of Auckland Business School<br>Alumni Relations team and also our<br>Graduate School of Management in<br>collaboration and for your information<br>we I think some of you already know this<br>because there are a few pieces here that<br>I've seen before in fact some that are<br>quite familiar to me and it's great to<br>see you here because we at the Business<br>School really do believe that it's<br>important to maintain our linkages with<br>alumni and we want to connect you with<br>the business school but more so with<br>each other as well and when I talk about<br>alumni I use the expression in the<br>broadest sense so yes alumni who have<br>qualified with formal qualifications<br>through the university through the<br>business school but also those of you<br>with with whom we have a relationship<br>for other reasons we we really<br>appreciate that it's important that that<br>we maintain contact with you and help<br>you along your journeys and so that we<br>achieve our own missions and we do<br>appreciate that in the current world of<br>Global Opportunities you have plenty of<br>other opportunities you could be<br>somewhere else tonight but of course<br>you've chosen to be here and you have<br>chosen wisely I am sure so you could be<br>anywhere though day or night and you can<br>actually connect with us via social<br>media and other means we see it as

are a collaboration<br>between alumni relations and between<br>executive education which is an arm of<br>our Graduate School of Management<br>because we recognize the importance of<br>professional development and we<br>recognize its importance to you as<br>professionals to business to the future<br>of management management capability more<br>generally and of course to the New<br>Zealand economy whichever category of<br>alumni you fit into I am glad that<br>you're here this evening and I hope that<br>you'll take away something new that will<br>help you in your professional lives and<br>I do as I said encourage you to stay in<br>touch with the school with the business<br>school that is to make the most of our<br>networks and events like this it's now<br>my very great pleasure to introduce<br>Devin Dean who is of course your speaker<br>this evening Devin Dean is an executive<br>education facilitator he is the director<br>of data and analytics at Enterprise IT<br>AIT and in this role he basically<br>ensures that customers can easily<br>navigate the complexities of<br>implementing data warehouses data<br>management business intelligence and<br>business analytic tools and solutions<br>his experience ranges from managing<br>multi-million dollar projects to leading<br>teams and starting businesses and he<br>attributes his success to being<br>proactive and having an inclusive<br>management style Devin's 25-year career<br>spans such roles as being in the United<br>States Marine Corps working with tech<br>startups in San Jose and Orlando and<br>locally the simple group and business<br>intelligence consulting firm Otis and<br>outside of AIT<br>Devon is active in New Zealand startup<br>community the tech startup community so<br>please I think we have a very<br>well-qualified speaker tonight please<br>join me in welcoming Devon Dean thank<br>you very very much right before I get<br>started I will give you some warning<br>about how I present and how I like to<br>teach<br>I'm very interactive I'm pretty full of<br>energy so if you came here just to watch<br>take some notes you're in the wrong<br>place I can tell you're gonna be very<br>active tonight so hopefully that's okay<br>with everyone also a quick show of hands<br>we started a little bit late is it okay<br>if we go to about you know seven thirty<br>five ish move past at 7:30 - that's okay<br>for people okay great and a quick show<br>of hands as well those with a technical<br>background raise your hand okay so about<br>a third awesome right so keep me on my<br>toes and make sure I'm not telling any<br>lies if you will I often speak to crowds<br>ranging from business to technical I<br>have to say thank you very much to the<br>University of Auckland this is a great<br>reception to come into the last<br>presentation I gave was a couple of<br>weeks ago down in Wellington and I had<br>to fight through a crowd of protesters<br>at the defense industry association<br>forum so this has been a nice<br>pleasurable experience so far okay so to<br>get into it I'm gonna teach a little bit<br>and hopefully you're gonna learn some<br>knowledge nuggets from me and I'd love<br>to learn a little bit from you as well<br>can I have your permission to learn from<br>you yeah<br>shaking heads yes anyone who not OK with<br>me to learn anything about yourselves No<br>okay cool<br>so the first thing I'd like to do many<br>people when you go to presentations or<br>workshops they say look please put your<br>phones in your pocket I don't when you<br>see them whatever that's not here I want<br>you to take your phones out if you can<br>yeah gone if you have your smartphones<br>going those who have them it's<br>completely optional but those who have<br>your smartphones pick them up and I'd<br>like you to go to a website for me first<br>okay<br>and the website name it's really easy to<br>to type in its demo de mo dot e - I T<br>that's where I work<br>and what that should do is take you to a<br>slide Oh area are you all there the<br>website address is demo dot e - I T dot<br>in Zed yeah should take you to a splash<br>page then you have a link to go to a<br>slide oh did you get it yeah all right<br>cool so I'm really interested to know<br>why you sat where you said that should<br>be the questions coming up on the slide<br>oh my colleague and - I see in the back<br>John would have an act enabled the slide<br>Oh poll going is that working<br>yeah cool so did you sit there because<br>you have friends did you sit there<br>because you wanted to meet new people so<br>if I could have one person from each<br>table stand up please one person from<br>each table stand up come on three two<br>one let's go quick and quick quick quick<br>one person each table great volunteers<br>fantastic all the poll working now is it<br>no okay we'll do this first and then<br>we'll get to the poll everyone else at<br>your table can you please take three<br>sheets of paper from in front of you and<br>sort of scrunch them up into balls all<br>right<br>and it's important that you get three<br>the person standing up doesn't have to<br>do this but everyone else scrunch up the<br>paper and the balls 3 balls yep every<br>person gets three balls hold on to them<br>don't throw them away no person standing<br>up doesn't need it<br>oh yeah yeah everyone have three balls<br>every person has three balls not the<br>table having three balls together if<br>you've got a table of four you should<br>have twelve paper balls a table of five<br>fifteen it's easy man yeah they're great<br>okay so before we moved into the age of<br>the Internet the way that we interacted<br>with our banks insurance companies and<br>the way that they interacted with with<br>us was it a little bit of a slower pace<br>so what I'd like to do is the person<br>standing up you're gonna have to test<br>your hand-eye coordination and going<br>around the table from left to right each<br>person will throw a ball one ball at the<br>person and they'll toss it back so go on<br>one ball to the person and toss it back<br>yep nice easy pace easy to deal with<br>awesome it's awesome okay stop throwing<br>the balls around that's good that's good<br>so what's happened that's how we used to<br>work with our thank you<br> that's where the that's how we<br>used to interact with our banks<br>insurance providers hospitals however in<br>the last 10 to 15 years things have<br>changed we've had the internet rollout<br>we've had lots of different systems such<br>as CRM systems social media come at us<br>right and now not only are we expecting<br>to interact at a faster pace with our<br>institutions at service but they're also<br>trying to interact with us at that to<br>match that pace to learn more about us<br>and provide more service to us so at<br>this time I'm now going to show you how<br>things work now the person standing up<br>right there everyone all at once throw<br>all three balls of them and they'll try<br>and throw it back right so go on three<br>two one go<br>Yeah right okay good<br>have you got it<br>this is hot spotted okay thank you that<br>you can thank you round of applause for<br>the people standing up yeah great hope<br>so with that visual metaphor hopefully<br>you can get an appreciation for your<br>service providers the banks that are<br>working for you and also yourself<br>remember that you're having that same<br>demand on them so it's really really<br>daunting to try and build up a<br>relationship and actually not only get<br>your services needs met but the<br>institution you're working with having<br>them understand you to make for them to<br>know what services you're asking for and<br>to how better to meet those needs have<br>we got the poll going we still don't<br>have the internet access okay we'll move<br>on and we'll get back to that one so why<br>be data-driven so you can understand<br>what that visual metaphor the balls<br>being data going back and forth that<br>it's really important to be able to<br>handle that data right so right now if<br>you could open up your workbooks on the<br>first page under the topics everyone<br>have a workbook cool just off the top of<br>your head list four five six whatever<br>you come up with in terms of why do you<br>think we've got a problem today with<br>with data and in working with the<br>service providers that we're trying to<br>interact with them for them to build up<br>a relationship you know do we have a<br>problem at all or what are the<br>opportunities for organizations today<br>from what you know in your own work life<br>what would you say those problems or<br>opportunities are so go ahead and write<br>you<br>so after you've finished listing out one<br>or two topics please go back to the the<br>demo dot e aí T dot in Zed site and then<br>that should take you to the poll on the<br>boards Cole and look be honest if you're<br>trying to avoid somebody we're trying to<br>get out of the get out of Derek the the<br>presentation quickly then please be<br>honest we so to let you know there's no<br>information other than your answers<br>being collected right so we're not<br>linking this in the Facebook yet or<br>LinkedIn cult right so a good view right<br>so what do we got polling most people<br>say that there was a good view from the<br>yep some people are meeting new people<br>great speedy exit out I love your<br>honesty that's good<br>no one opting for the I'm avoiding<br>people option liars you're all liars<br>okay fantastic okay that's good so today<br>what we're going to talk about is about<br>why be data-driven and what I tried to<br>do in the first five to ten minutes here<br>is really set the scene about you know<br>in a visual metaphor what is the problem<br>that organizations are facing today with<br>all this data coming at them from<br>multiple places I'm also going to help<br>you understand what to look for in a<br>project to an initiative that actually<br>might help you run your business a bit<br>better or interact with your customers<br>better using analytics of course the<br>foundation of those is data that pool<br>that gets pushed into those analytics<br>and lastly we're going to help you<br>select some of those ideas that you<br>might have and choose an analytic<br>project now today's short and sharp is a<br>very condensed version of a full-day<br>workshop that I run with the University<br>and if you want to learn more come back<br>come out of that training to get into<br>the details please join us then but<br>hopefully after today you'll have enough<br>knowledge to go back to your<br>organizations and maybe start triggering<br>some of these ideas and putting them<br>into motion<br>that's my hope today as well as a little<br>bit of entertainment hopefully most of<br>the kinks have been worked out so far<br>today so why be data-driven we talked<br>about that and now I just want to set<br>the scene in terms of what a I guess a<br>general definition a widely appealing<br>definition of what analytics is and<br>effectively when people talk about<br>analytics they're talking about finding<br>ways to understand the data looking for<br>those patterns right as an example in in<br>the previous days and anyone work in the<br>marketing crowd anyone here doing<br>marketing at all yep so you're well<br>aware of segmentation analysis<br>understanding the customers a bit better<br>well generally in the old days that<br>segmentation analysis was as good as we<br>could get because of the level of data<br>that we had available or the ability to<br>process that data limited us to be able<br>to create categories for these data's<br>nowadays with the processing capability<br>we have in things like big data or even<br>in the cloud you're able to process a<br>hell of a lot more data and as a result<br>the clustering technique is being<br>overcome by excuse me the segmentation<br>techniques being overcome by what's<br>called clustering so ultimately in a<br>perfect world you might have a cluster<br>of one an individual but generally you<br>find that patterns of behaviors exist<br>between people and those clusters can<br>come together when you're using these<br>large Big Data solutions and with the<br>modern analytics so that's what we'll<br>talk about today hopefully to tune your<br>radar in to pick up ideas from your own<br>organizations you can take back with you<br>so a little bit about the chronology and<br>unfortunately I don't have a great story<br>to tell about the ability to actually<br>execute on those ideas that you might be<br>having in the past as people started<br>gathering data it was good enough to see<br>what happened yesterday and I got to<br>tell you that's really still important<br>in the industry today I hear a lot of<br>vendors talking about forget about the<br>yesterday's reporting who needs a data<br>warehouse or bi system you should be<br>doing predictive stuff if you don't<br>actually know your history how do you<br>know where you're going right if you try<br>and overwrite that history you can't<br>actually understand that you were at<br>this point and now you're here in the<br>redirect you can just be caught in sort<br>of a circle of confusion so I have to<br>tell you that those techniques<br>and tools and a way of working is<br>actually still really important um but<br>what's more important is learning from<br>that history and then moving that<br>forward so over the years as technology<br>increased and new methods came available<br>you could see that it became a lot<br>easier as a businessperson to actually<br>do this myself<br>and fortunately it's turned around a<br>little bit so it's very Kody out there<br>right now in terms of software<br>development if you really want to tap<br>into this machine learning or what they<br>call advanced intelligence so artificial<br>intelligence<br>you still need a software developer to<br>do that the tools haven't matured enough<br>to keep pace with that we did have a<br>small turn when the data visualization<br>sort of revolution took over people may<br>have used tools like tableau or click or<br>even power bi and then it became a lot<br>easier to actually work with the data<br>yourself<br>but nowadays I have to tell you it's<br>kind of gone backwards a few steps<br>probably because everyone once has<br>higher expectations of what they want to<br>achieve and also because of the<br>revolution of how these things are being<br>developed in an open-source community<br>rather than being pushed by big vendors<br>which is actually really democratic and<br>you see a lot more technology evolutions<br>happening right so let me just give you<br>a few categories under this larger<br>category of analytics right I break<br>these analytics into four different<br>areas right the first one is business<br>intelligence we talked about that<br>earlier and really that's about it is<br>about looking backwards you can't do<br>away everything you absolutely need to<br>know that history it's especially<br>important when you're doing regulatory<br>reporting finance banks they have that<br>requirement insurance companies have to<br>keep data for seven years for example<br>you know that is very important and will<br>never go away that's really your your<br>dance card to be honest because in a<br>maturity matrix when you're looking at<br>hey where do I go from my organization<br>if you try to start doing machine<br>learning right now you don't have those<br>necessary ingredients to get there<br>you're gonna stumble and fall so you<br>really got to start at the top and sort<br>of work your way down so doing some<br>business intelligence is really<br>important the next area of analytics is<br>data mining in that you're actually<br>exploring you may not know what you're<br>looking for but you've got the<br>algorithms at your hand and you've got<br>the data sets to interrogate that<br>actually show you what those patterns of<br>behavior behaviors are and you might and<br>I've given you some examples here so you<br>know bi is like well how many<br>customers are buying this product this<br>month right the next one in data mining<br>is well who's actually buying the<br>product what do we know about the<br>purchaser and you know what are they<br>what are they buying it and why are they<br>buying it the next step of course is<br>natural isn't it how do we predict who's<br>going to buy those are very important<br>for doing forecasting and your supply<br>chain and sales especially and<br>forecasting is interesting because it is<br>a little bit of a crystal ball gazing<br>and sometimes especially if the people<br>don't know what they're doing with the<br>algorithms they might choose the wrong<br>algorithm and get a result and assume<br>that's the right answer when actually<br>it's not not all the algorithms work the<br>same on the data sets that you have so<br>it's really important to have someone<br>who's come from a statistical background<br>to actually help you and when you're<br>trying to get into the predictive<br>analytics and last is machine learning<br>who's heard of machine learning here<br>yeah so I started using it in the 1990s<br>everyone remember t9 I'm gonna date<br>myself on the old Nokia phones the<br>predictive text yeah oh yeah what<br>happened to that lol right that's what<br>took over so you know way back when in<br>the 90s we had predictive text and that<br>was a form of machine learning because<br>it it assumed what you wanted to talk<br>about often you know when you're trying<br>to write in slang or between friends you<br>maybe have you know may be doing you a<br>disservice there but it's gotten lots<br>and lots better<br>over time because of the natural<br>language processing algorithms that are<br>in use today it still gets it wrong<br>though doesn't it<br>not quite perfect yeah so machine<br>learning is really taking what you've<br>learned in the history from business<br>intelligence and the exploration from<br>data mining and the predictive nature<br>and then it puts action to that<br>prediction right so you can do it in a<br>large scale or you can do it in a small<br>scale and I've got some really cool<br>examples to share with you on that a<br>little bit later any questions so far<br>cool if you have them there's actually a<br>question Bank I think in the slider that<br>you can go to if the question strikes<br>you again here's some more examples here<br>to try and drive at home it's important<br>to actually look at these for a second<br>take them into into your mind because<br>I'm going to be asking you soon another<br>who's experienced themselves some<br>machine learning in those examples that<br>anyone applied for credit lately yeah<br>okay maybe that's a little bit too<br>sensitive you have so a lot of times in<br>the insurance industry bringing able to<br>predict who's actually going to be a<br>risk to you or not has been very very<br>important and so they've had a lot of<br>statistical people involved to<br>understand what that risk is and put<br>risk levels on individuals as they apply<br>for an insurance package nowadays and<br>you've heard of Yui is an example that<br>one heard of that these things are being<br>done automated right there's this<br>there's a machine learning algorithm<br>behind there that sort of looks at your<br>details ask you some additional<br>information about yourself and then<br>determines what your risk level is<br>that's taking the place of people doing<br>that at the moment right so you'll see<br>how this sort of thing is sort of coming<br>into our everyday life see a lot of<br>people taking pictures do you provide<br>the presentation afterwards you do not<br>so take your pictures if you want them<br>yeah there you go I won't be offended<br>lots of pictures so you want me a photo<br>bomb one no look yesterday was Halloween<br>right I have to tell you if you saw me<br>yesterday you'd probably not take me<br>seriously today but I'm an American if<br>you haven't picked it out so it's one of<br>the holidays that I really get into and<br>encouraging my children had a zombie and<br>I also had a the Dread Pirate Roberts<br>turday if anyone knows who the Dread<br>Pirate Roberts is yes yeah if you don't<br>go look up the Princess Bride and watch<br>it this week and it's a great chick<br>flick<br>not in the slide day see me see me<br>afterwards I'll share them around my<br>phone you talked to my clients they'll<br>think I'm absolutely bananas but that's<br>all right you got to have good work<br>stories don't you okay some example use<br>cases right so the first thing I'm going<br>to do I won't tell you a use case but I<br>will give you a reference and you want<br>to probably take a picture of this next<br>slide so this was from McKenzie this<br>report was put out in 2015 and what they<br>did they did a whole lot of research<br>over a couple of years and actually<br>looked at the value of this thing called<br>the Internet of Things in big data<br>you know why are we actually spending<br>time talking about this what's the big<br>deal we don't understand right so they<br>went and did the research so that we<br>could understand and this is a fantastic<br>reference guide for you there's a small<br>version and a big version and it really<br>goes into details industry by industry I<br>believe there's nine industries they<br>look at and they they try and examine<br>where the benefits are going to come<br>well it's really interesting in this<br>particular piece of research was that<br>the two areas that they really focused<br>in was on streamlining operations so<br>operational efficiency and also customer<br>interaction knowing your customer a lot<br>better those two categories rang true in<br>in all of the categories especially in<br>the smart city area where Politan excuse<br>me government and city government<br>especially wants to know more about us<br>so they can serve us a lot better and<br>that's where they see an explosion<br>happening there's a few data politics<br>involved in that but I'm that's a topic<br>of another another day right some<br>examples everybody can harken back to<br>2013 this year it didn't really pay off<br>for Oracle but in 2013 it did I had a<br>friend of mine he was the head of the of<br>the Oracle campaign from a technical<br>perspective and he ran all of these<br>systems and all of the analytics that<br>provided them the information they<br>needed to know to make the decision on<br>the fateful day to change the camber of<br>the wing so what they had on their boat<br>they were pretty wired up there's about<br>300 sensors on the boat itself each of<br>the sailors had a PDA and a sensor<br>motion sensor they could also hack in if<br>they saw something a little bit<br>different or weird they<br>a little time hack on their little their<br>watches the watches actually even though<br>they were sponsored by t SOT they<br>weren't to sots they're just knockoffs<br>like you know this Timex I have with 2<br>SOT on the front because Tesla didn't<br>have the watch they needed which they<br>actually built which had the inputs they<br>could put into the into the boat to<br>actually do time hacks on when certain<br>things happened<br>the sailors noted it what else they<br>allowed them to basically feed 30 up to<br>30 variables into a real-time system<br>which then gave them some ideas on what<br>to do gentlemen he's actually he's a<br>Kiwi he went over to New Zealand sorry<br>to America to run in the campaign and<br>he's back now working for the Ministry<br>of Health and using data and analytics<br>to improve our health services at the<br>moment but this was a really interesting<br>example and he tells me without the<br>numbers coming back on terms of the<br>sensors and the multivariate analysis on<br>the current and the weather they<br>wouldn't have been able to say alright<br>we're gonna have some soft wind change<br>the camber of the wing the boats not<br>going to tip over and go forth and you<br>know the rest of it right biggest<br>comeback not the second time well the<br>health system work asked the current<br>government I am NOT biased you know I'm<br>like I got no room to talk with my<br>country back home okay zero and that's<br>another use case in social behavior with<br>Cambridge analytic I could talk to you<br>about that later but today we're going<br>to talk about zero everyone's heard of<br>zero yeah and used it so what we find in<br>zero and this this is from a friend of<br>mine Sandesh he's the head of did in<br>analytics and zero and he gave this this<br>interesting case study a couple of<br>months ago it allowed me to recast it<br>and let you know what they're doing at<br>zero in this space so at zero what<br>they're doing is you small business<br>owners really many of them haven't come<br>through the university or gone on a<br>short course on you know finance and<br>accounting 101 so they're accounting in<br>the books that they have within Xero are<br>pretty shocking some of the statistics<br>they have is as as example about many<br>many different categories for sales<br>one in five invoices are recoded from<br>the sales<br>account everyone you familiar with<br>accounting<br>you know GL codes and stuff I can okay<br>cool um the challenge they have though<br>is about every month three million<br>recode x' happen in the in just a simple<br>sales category and that means as a small<br>business owner i'm recoding odd didn't<br>mean to go there and needs to go into<br>this category or whatever so it's a real<br>becomes a burden for the business owner<br>who may not really care about running a<br>clean set of books but more really<br>reliant on the trade and what they're<br>doing so they tried to figure out how<br>can we actually help the small business<br>owner in this regard what can we do to<br>help them and so what they thought is<br>well just like predictive text account<br>codes should be pretty generic let's see<br>what we can do to predict what people<br>may want to push this invoice into so<br>they get it into the right GL code to<br>the right category and unfortunately<br>where they found is because of this<br>problem the uniqueness of every<br>individual business that's within zero<br>they couldn't just write one big out of<br>the were them that dealt with everything<br>what they found is they had to write<br>little mini acronyms for everybody<br>within zero all the difference<br>individual businesses that are set up<br>we're very unique and different and so<br>they've trained the machine learning<br>algorithm individually on a select group<br>right now they haven't run it give me<br>rolled it out worldwide to all the<br>customer group but that's an interesting<br>fact that they found and they also found<br>that using a an algorithm called i won't<br>tell you what it is secret sauce right<br>but it was better than just rules based<br>so in the old days we used to have rules<br>if this then this then that and boom<br>there's an answer right but with the<br>algorithms it can be a little bit more<br>dynamic right and so they found that to<br>take be double so what's it just rules<br>it was about a 40% predictive rate with<br>the algorithms it was an eighty percent<br>so they decided to move forward with<br>that program right they're helping us<br>out they're helping small business users<br>ultimately what they want to do is not<br>have any coding at all code free is<br>where they're headed and this is a<br>little vision of what they see they're<br>headed to after that so you know as a<br>business owner I get this message and it<br>does something for me right and as a<br>business it's on my watch yep prove the<br>payment off you go off to the next next<br>deal so that's Sam desh you can look him<br>up on online and be glad to talk to you<br>about this the smart stuff they're doing<br>at zero another example is with with<br>Airlines so my business we do<br>the airline's this is an example of what<br>Boeing's done so you think Boeing makes<br>planes right everyone thinks they make<br>planes they've actually turned into a<br>data company one of the things they've<br>sold especially with this Dreamliner is<br>a data program and a data contract with<br>all the different airlines that they're<br>servicing where they are now providing<br>operational information and<br>recommendations on the data that's being<br>collected on these flying smartphones<br>it's about a hundred and forty thousand<br>data points or data collection points on<br>one of these beasts collects it<br>worldwide when it's in motion all that<br>data goes back to Boeing and they<br>provide that service for fee of course<br>to their airline clients airlines are<br>also so that's the manufacturer airlines<br>are also using information that they<br>haven't been able to do previously these<br>things generate a heap of heap of data<br>every time they fly up it's about a<br>trillion records okay to store all that<br>in the traditional fashion in a<br>relational database<br>takes a lot of time and money and<br>nowadays they have new techniques just<br>to put it into what's called a data Lake<br>in that data Lake they can now run the<br>algorithms on things on the data and the<br>flight information they previously could<br>only aggregate up so as an example I've<br>got a customer who has taken that<br>information sliced it up or multiplied<br>it by five times by by taking smaller<br>slices of a particular flights and<br>understand the schedule and on-time<br>performance a little bit better in order<br>to try and find where they can actually<br>squeeze the time off the flights when<br>we're out there in the internet picking<br>flights we're of course gonna go for the<br>shortest one so five minutes here ten<br>minutes there means a hell of a lot of<br>difference to this custard there's some<br>particular airline companies revenue<br>it's another example from flights again<br>that was around operational efficiency<br>and also with condition based<br>maintenance for Boeing anyone heard of<br>the IDI it's being looked after by stats<br>yeah<br>one person cool so there's a really cool<br>story with this and it's around ria<br>fenders so what happened here and this<br>was sponsored by Bill English what they<br>wanted to do is is as we know<br>departmental even in small departments<br>have a hard time sharing data think<br>about government departments bringing<br>their data together so there was an all<br>the government initiative it said right<br>we're gonna smash through these barriers<br>and these these tribal silos of<br>information we're gonna create what's<br>called an integrated data infrastructure<br>stats New Zealand as the Switzerland of<br>all the government departments has been<br>told they're going to be the data<br>right now they've got about 162 million<br>facts in it and it's a it's a beast it's<br>a 1.2 terabytes worth of data and it's<br>bringing data in from various different<br>apartments one great use case on this<br>and why that's important is because the<br>more data sets you blend together the<br>more context you get in the perspectives<br>think about it as looking sort of at a<br>three dimensional object one way and<br>then turning around the other corner and<br>seeing the other perspective if anyone's<br>seen the Ok Go videos where they sort of<br>do those weird things it's one of those<br>things you need to see the full<br>perspective to gain the full idea of<br>what's happening and that's what you can<br>do with the IDI so what got blended in<br>this use case was government from MSD so<br>a date of MSD data from Corrections and<br>also from justice and by bringing those<br>datasets together they could find and<br>predict the people who are going to<br>reoffending why they could predict it is<br>because they found that after a parolee<br>was employed we all know after the six<br>month mark what do we get as employees<br>sick days exactly so on six months and<br>one day the parolees who then took a<br>sick day were the ones that were more<br>likely to start reoffending again so<br>that was an interesting thing that they<br>were able to determine just by bringing<br>those three different datasets together<br>so now the parole officers can intervene<br>say how you doing you having a nice day<br>you like work to make sure that the<br>reoffending doesn't happen because<br>that's we don't want that in our<br>community and it's very expensive on the<br>government to deal with ok this is a<br>local example that my team have done so<br>in Christmas it's generally a quiet<br>period so I give my time my team time to<br>do hackathons and we've done one of<br>these this one is using publicly<br>available data from Auckland Transport<br>anyone tapped into that API feed no ok<br>so this is an interesting one<br>so they publish a their data available<br>to the web you just have to apply for it<br>you say look may I please see your data<br>it's public data they say yes and you<br>can make about 35,000 calls a week which<br>equates to about every 10 seconds you<br>can pull it if you do that you get a<br>general idea of where all the public<br>transportation assets are are at any<br>given time and if you then pull the<br>other data feed they have around the the<br>schedule of the buses and the schedule<br>you can start to work out a picture of<br>how they're doing performance wise so<br>I've grayed out the the offenders but<br>what my team have now done<br>has done a bit of predictive and<br>understanding which of the routes are<br>always going to be late which of the<br>stops gonna be late buy by the company<br>and by the routes and I haven't yet<br>published this on our website I'm sort<br>of trying to work with Auckland<br>Transport before I do that but maybe I<br>do<br>and maybe that's something that you want<br>to use to find out your how your public<br>transportation service is going a last<br>one I've talked about all the great<br>stories here's one that's not so great<br>this is an example for you just to just<br>to gauge where you are when you put your<br>ideas on analytic projects for your<br>organization on maybe it's a step too<br>far just yet natural language processing<br>has been in works for many many many<br>years right it's getting better and<br>better and better it's not quite there<br>yet<br>this gentleman max douche tried to take<br>all the Harry Potter books scanned them<br>so he did the optical character<br>recognition threw it into his NLP engine<br>and he asked it to write a book have you<br>guys seen has anyone seen this before<br>yeah okay so this is what the algorithm<br>after ingesting all of those books in<br>the context said this is a story that it<br>wrote automatically okay that makes<br>sense to you yeah really there yet is it<br>not really there yeah that's right I<br>don't want to read into that first line<br>but yes so it's not quite there yet so<br>when you're coming up with your ideas<br>and a second or two think about that as<br>well you know put your black hat on and<br>say well actually maybe that's a little<br>bit up to bridge too far okay<br>so the reason why I wanted to go through<br>all the use cases was to try and give<br>you an idea and sort of stimulate your<br>thinking about in your own organization<br>where you might find some opportunities<br>right so in your workbook going back to<br>your workbook you will have the second<br>page right list eight ideas where data<br>can make smarter we data but can use to<br>make smarter decisions so hopefully my<br>use case is a stimulated your thinking<br>on that and what I'd like you to do now<br>in your own space is to write down eight<br>ideas where you think in your<br>organization data can be used to make<br>smarter decisions I'll give you two<br>minutes for that<br>you<br>okay if you could go back through on the<br>margins of those ideas if you could<br>categorize them based on what we talked<br>about the four categories in analytics<br>either business intelligence machine<br>learning you know the deep data mining<br>or the predictive analytics just write<br>that down on the side and then we're<br>going to learn a little bit about the<br>audience and where their choices are so<br>back on the slide Oh site there'll be<br>another poll open where I'd like to<br>actually know where you where your<br>head's are at where do you think the<br>most value is by show of numbers in<br>those areas so if you've got for example<br>a bi one mark a bi one you should be<br>able to answer as many times as you have<br>ideas so if you got it's an open poll so<br>if you have eight ideas you should be<br>able to go yeah I got to be I one data<br>mining one predictive analytics and a<br>machine learning to go please yeah you<br>should just it's an open poll so you<br>just would just tick them tick them<br>twice to come three times we're really<br>so what I think will happen is everyone<br>will try and go for the sexy machine<br>learning and forget about VI but we'll<br>see how that goes<br>hopefully not hopefully you valued you<br>know bi okay there we go yep<br>some would say showing the answers<br>influence the outcome but I'm not a<br>okay you don't want to influence the<br>outcome John John's a philosopher by<br>schooling so we'll forgive them for the<br>hands<br>okay so the next topic I want to present<br>is really trying to give you an<br>indication of now that you've got these<br>ideas what are the ingredients that<br>that's an interesting fact<br>hoora business intelligence still going<br>strong pretty important okay<br>I'm gonna sort of give you some<br>information about that would hopefully<br>sharpen your radar in being able to<br>discern which of the ideas that you<br>wrote are actually going to be plausible<br>or not okay and by doing that I'll just<br>sort of share with you the necessary<br>ingredients oh there we go back again I<br>also will give a shout-out to a<br>colleague of mine he works for Dell EMC<br>and he's also a lecturer at the<br>University of San Francisco I met him a<br>couple of years ago at a data conference<br>in San Jose and he's been gracious to<br>allow me to recast some of his ideas<br>here either as a friendly knowledge<br>share or perhaps maybe to sell more of<br>his books I haven't figured out which so<br>bills he's got a couple of books one's<br>called big data the other is the I think<br>it's a Big Data MBA both of those are<br>powerful resource material for myself<br>and my team and maybe you'll find them<br>beneficial as well and he goes through<br>this recipe and will only be able to in<br>the time allowed be able to go through<br>the first one really is actually<br>understanding you know what do I need to<br>actually get one of these analytic<br>projects off the ground okay so the<br>first thing you really need to do and it<br>always starts with the business you know<br>many times I get approached by lots and<br>lots of people with ideas and say hey<br>Devin come help me you know you do some<br>startups come help me and sell this I've<br>got a great idea and I really say yeah<br>that's a great it's really it's<br>unfortunately it's disheartening but<br>inventors don't actually understand the<br>business context and how to put those<br>ideas in a way where you're gonna have<br>commercial success so that those ideas<br>grow and grow and grow so really you've<br>got to start with that business<br>initiative and often when those people<br>approach me I go back to them and say<br>okay how does it actually make sense in<br>business how can you actually turn this<br>into this idea into something that's<br>commercial where it can feed itself has<br>the cash flow and can grow and grow so I<br>really want to get it across the<br>starting point for any<br>these isn't the cool thing that you can<br>build it's really about why you're doing<br>it okay and it's about the business<br>initiative so here's a secret sauce<br>these are the things that you need these<br>ingredients here to actually make one of<br>your analytic projects come to life<br>right so you're looking at clear<br>business ownership you're often gonna<br>cross politics okay you're gonna get<br>territories are gonna be drawn up<br>information is power right you people<br>will come out of the Woodworks and try<br>and shoot you down and you're gonna need<br>that ally or allies to come in and help<br>you bring people together have a nice<br>informative and logical non emotional<br>conversation about why you're doing<br>things and you need that business<br>ownership there it has to be important<br>to the business enough to give<br>above-the-line most organizations are<br>really working hard to do a great job<br>and so the daily the daily tasks become<br>huge and huge you know bigger and bigger<br>so it has to be big enough to change the<br>scope of the business and for business<br>owners and users to actually provide the<br>time to whatever initiative you're<br>trying to get off the ground again a<br>certain sense of urgency is important<br>sometimes I look for what's called<br>blunder funding so sense of urgency can<br>be generated if there is for example a<br>security breach in in a data set that<br>may have personal identifying<br>information in there in that case that<br>will absolutely strike the fear in the<br>heart of any CEO because the minute you<br>learn you lose the trust of your your<br>customers your business is out of<br>business right so sense of urgency is<br>very important a big one is around data<br>security and data sovereignty a<br>compelling return on investment a<br>learning culture you need a culture<br>that's willing to adapt and sort of say<br>yeah well this worked a little bit and<br>then go the next next distance most of<br>these projects get started with small<br>initiatives they start as a proof of<br>concept moving to a pilot and then grow<br>rarely do I see a successful analytic<br>project starting as a big bang you might<br>see that sometimes in the banks does it<br>work I don't know they spend a lot of<br>money I don't know if it works some of<br>you who work in banks can tell me<br>subject matter experts are really<br>important so not the technical ones I'm<br>talking about the business subject<br>matter experts because they're the ones<br>who bring that real-life grass roots<br>how's this actually going to work in our<br>organization how are we going to change<br>processes how we're going to change<br>perhaps the people that we use and the<br>thing<br>we're doing with the analytic outcome<br>when we put it into motion a bounty of<br>potential data sources and usually this<br>isn't a problem these days and if you<br>don't have one you can go get one anyone<br>use flightradar24 yeah a few of you fly<br>around right so they had a problem in<br>that there was this enthusiast out of<br>Sweden came up with flight radar 24<br>they're limited in their resources and<br>how many transponders they can grow in<br>the community so what do they do they<br>went out and sold they got little<br>packaged prefab kits for the other<br>enthusiasts at around the world to buy<br>for $100 and then of course their whole<br>network grows worldwide so they didn't<br>have a problem with that they got over<br>their problem with having data sources<br>not available or the capital actually<br>fund that data quality is really<br>important can't stress that enough it<br>isn't until you get into one of these<br>projects we actually understand how bad<br>your data is I'll tell you it's always<br>worse than you think it is okay it's<br>always worse than you think it is<br>Analytics friendly which means it's not<br>pre it's not pre calculated it doesn't<br>have for example hierarchies it's really<br>what we call low grain low density of<br>information individual transactions for<br>events and technical skills available to<br>help you with that everyone who got a<br>picture wanted a picture this I got one<br>tree it's in the book it's in the book<br>thank you very much it's in the book<br>right good next exercise putting your<br>analytic project ideas together all<br>right<br>putting plotting right sorry about that<br>okay so on your eight ideas what I'd<br>like you to do now is pick three okay<br>pick three write them in their workbook<br>go to your workbooks pick three of those<br>ideas and then to the person next to you<br>I want you to tell them share with them<br>why you picked those three ideas over<br>the eight or more that you had on the<br>other page if you only had one idea well<br>you can say oh I only have one idea so I<br>made it to this next page but really I<br>want you to have a look at based on the<br>ingredients you need for an analytic<br>project filtered through your list and<br>pick three when you've picked those<br>three there's a few other categories for<br>you to fill in in your workbook do the<br>best that you can<br>and then once you've done that look to<br>your left or right pick a victim and<br>tell them why you picked those three<br>ideas please so I'll wait for the noise<br>level to get to a dull roar before we<br>10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1<br>thank you everyone wrap up your chats<br>great ok next exercise<br>so just springboarding off your fervor<br>for your ideas and your convincing<br>nature to your to your partner to your<br>left or right what I'd like you to do is<br>then flip over to the next page of your<br>workbook and plot those three ideas on<br>that graph it's a simple XY plot looking<br>at your relative ease and you're against<br>your return on investment again this is<br>all just your judgment plot those three<br>ideas on on the on the graph just little<br>scatter plot just a plot a dot maybe<br>write the name to remind you or one two<br>three<br>ABC z Y X if you like to go the other<br>direction<br>okay if you've plotted those pick one<br>that you want to do when you pick that<br>one I'll ask you to go back onto your<br>smart phones and type in the working<br>title for that idea what we're going to<br>do now is find a work that's going to<br>form a word cloud from those those<br>working titles that you type in and<br>we'll see what's popular so pick one go<br>to the slide Oh app and right in the<br>working title just type it in as best<br>you can<br>brevity is best so if you look up on the<br>screen you'll see where the commonality<br>may be and the size of the word tells<br>you the usage it's just really just if<br>it's used more than its bigger fantastic<br>just since of the only thing I didn't do<br>was bring in the venture capitalists<br>just at the door all the VCS to come in<br>and harvest these good ideas and work<br>with these bright individuals in here<br>awesome<br>awesome look as we wrap up I'd like to<br>start by first thanking you for your<br>appreciate your and appreciate your<br>contributions and your time and the<br>amount of effort that you have all have<br>put in today to hopefully well I love<br>thinking of ideas I love brainstorm so<br>hopefully there's been a really good<br>experience for you again I do appreciate<br>your time and your patience and the<br>initial technical difficulties that we<br>had my intention today other than just<br>to entertain and have a little bit of<br>levity in the day was to really help you<br>understand why we need to be data-driven<br>today what's the importance of that also<br>to help tune your analytics radar so in<br>your own organizations or in your<br>community you can have an eye out for<br>ideas where hey look if we do this a<br>little bit smarter use this data maybe<br>we can do some analysis and get a better<br>outcome right and so hopefully tuning<br>your radar on those projects that are<br>actually going to be feasible and move<br>forward lastly what I wanted to do with<br>you today is actually help you be a bit<br>real so plot those ideas against the<br>relative return on investment and also<br>the ease of getting it going so that<br>actually you can be your own personal<br>sanity check on those ideas and then<br>maybe to take that idea bring in another<br>person and move that idea for it so<br>again I appreciate your time today I<br>hope you learned a little bit I'm gonna<br>be here outside afterwards to answer any<br>questions actually I think we're gonna<br>take a couple of questions first yes yep<br>cool so if you have any questions how<br>much time do we have for those two or<br>three minutes okay great<br>any questions from the floor at all I'll<br>ask one first who's doing the tough<br>mudder this weekend right when we're on<br>the obstacles together help each other<br>out that's what it's about Cole<br>yes sir this is a a microphone no okay<br>cool right cool thank you for your<br>question I can't speak for the<br>Department of Corrections on this one<br>but I do know a few people there on that<br>and I think it's one of those what they<br>tell me it's actually it's because of<br>the the cohorts that they're involved<br>with so being able to say you know are<br>you ok on if they do take that sick<br>thing is important but also<br>understanding their cohorts could really<br>it's they fall back into the community<br>that they used to operate in from what<br>I've been told so I don't I don't work<br>for the department Corrections I I can<br>only tell you what I've been told it's<br>really about that's one indicator that<br>they may reoffending and there's<br>different social services to help them<br>with that to understand to prevent them<br>from reoffending so I don't know if I<br>actually I danced a little bit I don't<br>know if I answer your question sorry<br>about that<br>depends on the country depends okay<br>so New Zealand has some interesting laws<br>I won't purport to be a lawyer or know<br>them intimately right<br>but there are some privacy laws in New<br>Zealand which are probably a bit more<br>strict than other places such as the<br>u.s. so I can give you an example of the<br>US yep and so that may or may not relate<br>to what's happening in New Zealand on<br>the privacy laws everyone knows of the<br>campaign result a few months ago and<br>they've heard about how analytics were<br>used to influence decision makers on<br>that yep cool so in America you leave a<br>digital trail in fact John can you go up<br>and show that tab with the those<br>analytics so when I started this comment<br>that's a great conversation starter when<br>I started this event today I asked you<br>if I could learn a little bit about you<br>right I asked for your permission to do<br>that and most of the organizations you<br>still have to ask that permission but<br>once you grant that permission then it's<br>not one of those that some might have to<br>go over there and fiddle with it there<br>it's not on slide oh it's not on slide<br>out it's the demo II it1 it should be as<br>a favorite anyway<br>what he'll show you is when I asked you<br>for that and you gave me permission I<br>asked you to go to the demo deit<br>in zed website by doing so you left you<br>started leaving a digital trail okay so<br>that website captures your browser<br>information and actually captures the<br>operating system that you have on your<br>phone okay so if I were a marketer I'd<br>use that doesn't capture who you are<br>doesn't capture any personal indentify<br>you pull information about you other<br>than this is the browser and this is the<br>phone that it's using right and the and<br>the the release of the operating system<br>so let's say I worked for Apple and I<br>also looked in the poll that we had<br>earlier about where did you sit you know<br>did you sit because you wanted a speedy<br>exit did you sit because of friends or<br>did you sit because you wanted to meet<br>new people or was it because of the view<br>well I can actually use that information<br>and tie that to what I know about your<br>personal iPhone and then target a<br>message to you so let's say that you are<br>socially influenced by<br>others you like to be part of the group<br>perhaps you've got an older phone I<br>might send a message to you saying hey<br>did you know that so-and-so or your<br>friends or these people like you<br>actually have gone to the latest version<br>of the Apple iPhone or Samsung right and<br>I can target a message specifically to<br>you but because I asked for permission I<br>can do that I can harvest that<br>information most of the websites that<br>we're on today especially those social<br>media ones and I got to tell you I have<br>a couple of wonderful people from China<br>who used to work in these internet<br>Giants harvesting this information and<br>they are so scared about what they<br>they're so conservative about what<br>websites they join because they used to<br>do that as a trade is get that<br>information and the stories they can<br>tell you about what they found out about<br>how people were using your phones or<br>where they're using it or everything<br>else I mean talk about no data privacy<br>absolutely when you sign into is that we<br>chat whatever they capture everything<br>about you and those without an iOS or<br>even worse all those applications work<br>together and bring all that information<br>together to the application vendors<br>right so be sensitive be sensible do<br>your research that's a great question if<br>you grant permission they'll give<br>everything from you right it's the<br>trade-off between oh I like your<br>application you do me a service they're<br>collecting information about you all the<br>time especially location-based<br>information which is really really<br>important back on the topic of Trump and<br>brexit did I say that maybe I did so<br>what happened there is they collected<br>information and they bought it this<br>Cambridge analytic<br>from Facebook and other social media<br>sites they absolutely entitled to that<br>they bought it it's theirs they can use<br>it for their advantage and they target<br>their messages to people who would more<br>likely be moved who actually hadn't made<br>a decision now where it's interesting is<br>that for the u.s. campaign that<br>information was processed in in in in<br>England right in a data center in<br>England there's a professor in New York<br>City who's actually English and the<br>writes in in England is if if you're<br>using my information and I want to know<br>what you're doing with it I can ask you<br>and you have to tell me right<br>what Cambridge analytic I said is what<br>actually you're not in England so you're<br>not it doesn't matter but the point is<br>the data was processed in England so now<br>there's a lawsuit pending<br>if any of you are in the legal<br>profession I can tell you we'll make a<br>mint on prosecuting and this whole idea<br>about data sovereignty and individual<br>rights to our data it is an emerging<br>field absolutely absolutely<br>good question did you find the website<br>John no computer died what you don't<br>know is I left home without my laptop<br>cable and my battery life is out so<br>piss-poor planning prevents piss-poor<br>principal who had a good performance<br>anyway right one more question or that's<br>it one more quick question everyone<br>wants a beer you've been
