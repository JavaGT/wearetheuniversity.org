agency so that learners now take a more pro-active role in their own learning.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the circumstances that lead to us<br>working with team solutions was we got<br>our major overall teacher judgment data<br>and our writing data was quite a bit<br>lower than our reading data I think we<br>had about 38% of students below the<br>national standard worth a higher<br>Kuzco is a small rural school and it<br>came to us with a problem around its<br>writing data it's a problem that seen<br>across New Zealand on a regular basis<br>the particulars of motor purrs school<br>were very specific to them and we really<br>had to come to grips with what was going<br>on at multiple school but with the<br>teachers and what their learners for us<br>to make a change for them to begin with<br>we created a plan and it was a<br>three-fold plan it was looking at<br>developing understanding around data<br>looking at developing clarity of<br>teaching building success criteria and<br>developing agency for their learners<br>from out of this plan we're hoping to<br>dovetail all these things together and<br>start seeing some shift and what I am<br>seen is shift within teacher confidence<br>student achievement and also leadership<br>competence and I'm feeling that we're on<br>once we had a clear understanding of<br>what the data was telling us then we<br>could start really looking closely at<br>our learners pathways setting out goals<br>and success criteria specific teaching<br>like front loading etc processes and<br>really understanding what our students<br>needed to ensured they made shift<br>it's one of the beauties really of<br>working with team solutions as as not<br>just one-off professional learning it as<br>a team approach there as sustained over<br>time east we are work in progress but<br>there is that sustained urgency around<br>end expectation around teachers working<br>together discussion and our staff<br>meetings the target students and what's<br>worked for that teacher with the idea<br>that everyone hears and builds on their<br>own capacity and capability urgency was<br>a really big thing at moto proof getting<br>a consistent at rate of urgency for<br>teachers and for students while we<br>wanted to take a process that needed to<br>be embedded we want to make sure that<br>everyone understood this was really<br>important the first part of it was to be<br>really clear about what we were teaching<br>if the teachers were clear about what<br>they were teaching then the learners are<br>be clear about what they were learning<br>and this would make success criteria<br>setting learning intentions meeting<br>purpose and developing audience for our<br>students much easier from the clarity<br>around teaching and learning the<br>students think develop their own agency<br>agency became the big under pendent for<br>the whole journey in terms of teacher<br>agency and student agency having some<br>clarity for our learners meant that they<br>could start looking at their work and<br>analyzing it themselves and setting<br>their own goals for their next learning<br>research shows and we found too that<br>students who are below our passive<br>learners they sit there on wait to be<br>told what to do they're like spoon-feed<br>and within the classroom and so the<br>research shows that if students have<br>agency then they are more in control of<br>their learning they are taking ownership<br>of their learning and we've started to<br>see this across the school the students<br>actively highlighting and they're<br>writing box the evidence of the luening<br>in talking about we are the next steps<br>are and what they need to be doing<br>one of the big shifts at motor COO was<br>actually moving away from ability<br>grouping and we set it off on a<br>beginning process of taking groups off<br>teacher aides which seemed really<br>difficult for some of them to get the<br>head around and once they got it in<br>place they loved it and so did the<br>teacher aides because the teacher aides<br>then had a real role in a responsibility<br>within the class that didn't involve<br>having to work as tightly with children<br>and create shift for children but<br>actually enabled them to support the<br>teacher in that role moving away from<br>ability grouping meant that the children<br>could be mixed up they could learn off<br>each other they were sharing information<br>more and sharing their work more<br>purposefully one thing I've worked on<br>with marika is the acceleration of<br>priority learners in the classroom so<br>not teaching and remediation but<br>teaching to where they need to be at<br>this has been huge for my classroom it's<br>been really empowering for those<br>students and they are able to have the<br>same learning goals as their peers and<br>able to communicate these successes and<br>their success criteria with those around<br>them which is really awesome to see<br>their students in my classroom have<br>responded really positively to the<br>success criteria and they're focused<br>engaging activities that we've been<br>planning students I've noticed have felt<br>empowered when this year and with their<br>learning partners those successes that<br>they've had in their writing listen and<br>they're able to communicate that they<br>have had a successful writing lesson<br>which has been really awesome to see<br>they've become more responsible for<br>their learning and they're taking<br>responsibility for their learning goals<br>and how they can achieve those learning<br>goals this journey has been a great<br>success for Marsha Pugh in terms of the<br>teacher confidence the teacher<br>capability development and the<br>understanding of of actually what is<br>to see the teachers grow in their<br>confidence and we know to talk about<br>their teaching ability and their ideas<br>around how to lift their own capability<br>and alongside that seeing the shift in<br>student achievement is obviously a<br>highlight for us a matter poo and it<br>isn't us because I believe it's have<br>been a team<br>thus Junior is only just beginning and I<br>like to think that for motor poo the<br>journey will continue as they grow in<br>their confidence<br>I'm just so sold on what she's doing for<br>our staff and their kids you-know-who<br>passion is there as well it's not you<br>can see it's not just a job to hear in<br>the working together with myself and the<br>staff it's just making all the<br>difference it's linked to research good<br>practice who ability to model her<br>ability to have challenging<br>conversations and the staff respect and<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
