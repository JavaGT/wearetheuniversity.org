development including effective use of e-asTTle, learner profiles and more.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the first thing we did was we sat down<br>together and we actually came out with a<br>plan there was four or five of us<br>involved in that three senior leadership<br>and we also pulled out a couple of<br>teachers as well because I wanted to<br>make sure that the plan wasn't just what<br>the management thought was important I<br>wanted to make sure that there were<br>teachers involved in the process so that<br>we could actually identify what the<br>needs of the students were and make sure<br>that was put under the plan so we looked<br>at where we wanted to be in five or ten<br>years and a lot of it was just like big<br>goal dreaming you know this is what we'd<br>like to achieve and in this amount of<br>time and then from VA we actually worked<br>backwards and got it right down to a<br>3-year plan what we wanted to achieve<br>over the next three years and we<br>identified five main areas once we'd<br>identified what the five main goals were<br>we broke those right down and within<br>each goal we had to identify how we were<br>going to address the needs and what we<br>were going to do to make sure we got to<br>the big end results so initially we<br>focused on data analysis actually<br>because arrow also identified that we<br>had some inconsistency in our data so we<br>looked at the data we broke that down we<br>actually did that across the school so<br>that the teachers could actually<br>understand the breakdown of what it<br>actually looks like on a large scale<br>rather than just in their classrooms and<br>once we had identified where the<br>specific needs were we started working<br>we had to identify what we had what we<br>didn't have so we needed to do a lot of<br>foundation building so that we had good<br>systems and processes in which to gather<br>the information but also evaluate what<br>information we had and what was the<br>quality of it and how are we going to<br>use that to drive the improvement theory<br>within the school we started with es<br>door we'd actually already been using<br>air still in the school but it hadn't<br>been used as effectively as what it had<br>been previously<br>so we reintroduced that and made sure<br>that the teachers were trained to<br>once we gave it the a a store data and<br>had done some analysis of it it provides<br>a really good starting point for<br>teachers in terms of what are the things<br>that I need to find what are the things<br>my students don't have one of the things<br>that this a store tests are showing that<br>they don't have I found the analysis of<br>the data looking at it being able to<br>identify specific areas to focus on very<br>helpful in my own practice so it's<br>changed the way I've looked at the way I<br>teach writing the way I show children<br>the types of modeling I'm doing the<br>exemplars that I use a lot more thought<br>goes into that and a lot more narrowing<br>down the focus less as more because<br>especially a struggling writer it's easy<br>to look at it and said this child needs<br>all this done for them and it's too big<br>so narrowing it down breaking down those<br>learning intentions to something<br>achievable both for me as a teacher and<br>for the child as a student has made it<br>far easier to focus my teaching in a<br>more explicit way<br>from me we've also done quite a lot of<br>other work and writing like we've we<br>started with reading learner profiles<br>for our target students each teacher had<br>to identify five students who were below<br>and writing and who needed quite a lot<br>of support and we created printer<br>profiles for those students and them<br>from vo we also have been monitoring<br>those students so we've had regular<br>monitoring meetings every Monday to<br>guide and make sure that those students<br>are actually progressing<br>part of this process is that the<br>teachers have become a lot more aware<br>about what they're doing through those<br>initial practice analysis conversations<br>teachers really saw things that they<br>weren't sure that they didn't realize<br>that I did that and what they're doing<br>is they're making changes and they're<br>actually really going back and video in<br>themselves just for ten minutes just to<br>see are they being explicit you're<br>planning your listing and then you go<br>back and you're reflecting on that<br>lesson and it's like I didn't actually<br>quite do that or you know didn't quite<br>go the way I planned it and as a result<br>of these conversations I am a lot more<br>aware of you know if this is what I say<br>I'm doing in my lesson am I actually<br>doing this in my lesson my learning<br>intentions have become a lot more<br>specific well making sure my students<br>are more aware of what their learning<br>intention is as well as the success<br>criteria we've just filmed ourselves<br>again last week and analyzing that video<br>I did see an improvement and my teaching<br>and being more specific and what it was<br>I was actually doing with my students<br>what we've noticed for the students is<br>that they have a lot more awareness<br>about what they're learning and why they<br>might be doing it with her it fits into<br>the bigger picture they're able to talk<br>more about the role and the luening than<br>they have you know they could do a year<br>ago back in 2016 nokey was really good<br>to work with as their external<br>facilitator because she was really<br>honest and the key thing as she was able<br>to build relationships in our school and<br>it was really important because I needed<br>to know that the teachers weren't going<br>to feel like they were being judged I<br>wanted to make sure that they could work<br>with somebody that had that constructive<br>feedback but was also somebody that they<br>felt they could use as a guide or a<br>support that they weren't actually being<br>assessed on who they were as teachers it<br>was more about trying to get their<br>teaching practice improved so that we<br>could accelerate the achievement of our<br>students</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
