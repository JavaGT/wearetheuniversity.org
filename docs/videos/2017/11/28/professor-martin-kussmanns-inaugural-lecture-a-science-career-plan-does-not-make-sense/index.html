He thinks the professional path is a result of the interaction between passion and exposure â€“ similar to the gene-environment interactions that are studied today in life science. In this inaugural lecture, Martin shares his 'way of (professional) life', takes us on an 'omics' journey (that is, genomics and downstream) through human studies in nutrition and health, and thanks his mentors and teams along the way.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is Frank Bloomfield and I'm the<br>director of the Liggins Institute and<br>it's my great pleasure to welcome you<br>all here this evening for this Liggins<br>Institute professorial inaugural lecture<br>I particularly like to welcome<br>Manfred Anita Martin's parents who have<br>come over from Germany and were here to<br>see him tonight so before we begin just<br>the usual housekeeping please if you<br>could please all turn your mobile phones<br>off Auto silent bathrooms are either<br>across the atrium or down the corridor<br>to the right and if there's an emergency<br>the sirens and lights will flash and<br>sound and we all gather outside in the<br>sunshine thank you so tonight is an<br>inaugural lecture for a new professor<br>and inaugural lectures acknowledge the<br>either the appointment or promotion to<br>the professorial of the University of<br>Auckland the professorial of course is<br>the highest academic rank and as such it<br>is worthy of noting and celebration<br>particularly when in an institution<br>that's a world-class institution such as<br>University of Auckland academia<br>universities of course our ancient<br>institutions and date back to the 12th<br>century and the academic regalia that we<br>see in the Martins enjoying wearing for<br>the first time also stem from that time<br>when the early academics for all monks<br>and these essentially evolved from<br>ecclesiastical investments and the hoods<br>were of course the cowls of the monks<br>that kept them warm in the cold<br>libraries at night although I have heard<br>that at some inaugural lectures the<br>purse the nautical professor was<br>delivered the lecturers made to stand at<br>the front with his back to the audience<br>at the end of the lecture and everyone<br>drops a little note with a yes or no<br>into the hood deciding whether the<br>person should be admitted to the prophet<br>saw it or not but I don't think we'll<br>initiate that tonight and the particular<br>colors are a more recent invention and<br>come from about the 16th century and<br>those in Auckland based on the design<br>and the colors and opened debates on<br>those in University of Auckland<br>now the Cambridge Cambridge and the<br>University that Martin graduated from<br>which is constants University in Germany<br>doesn't have any of its own gals and<br>Martin tells me that they don't really<br>celebrate graduation and things like<br>that with much pomp in fact his PhD I<br>believe was awarded with a handshake in<br>an office by the chair of the department<br>and so Martin today is wearing the<br>academic regalia of a PhD from the<br>University of Auckland so tonight I'm<br>going to ask a distinguished professor<br>Jane Harding if she will introduce our<br>new professor and professor Martin<br>thank you Frank I think it's probably<br>significant that my gown doesn't have a<br>Professor Martin Koosman was born and<br>educated in Germany graduating with a<br>bachelor's degree in chemistry from the<br>University of are condemned a stir Zin<br>analytical chemistry from as you just<br>heard University at Constance his<br>doctoral research in biochemical<br>analytical biochemistry was undertaken<br>there and also at the University of<br>California San Francisco where he<br>specialized in proteomics and genomics<br>this was surely an indication of a<br>career to come so having crossed the<br>Atlantic from Germany to California he<br>then headed north to Sweden for his<br>postdoctoral training in mass<br>spectrometry<br>proteomics at Sundance University in<br>Sweden where he also worked with<br>pharmacy Upjohn on protein interactions<br>and drug development he then being<br>Martin said about acquiring a bit more<br>research experience and seeing a bit<br>more of the world his subsequent roles<br>included posts as a staff scientist in<br>proteomics at service Pharma in<br>Switzerland and a post as group leader<br>in mass spectroscopy and robotics at<br>geneva proteomics in 2003 he joined<br>Nestle Research Center as a group leader<br>in functional genomics where he built<br>and managed a team of twenty involved in<br>nutrigenomics and nutri ever genetics I<br>told you this was the beginning of a<br>theme and from there he joined Nestle<br>Institute of Health Sciences in Lausanne<br>in Switzerland as head of the molecular<br>biomarkers core which included<br>proteomics metabolomics<br>lipid omics micronutrient analysis and<br>their clinical applications and while<br>doing all this he also acquired<br>appointments as an honorary professor<br>for nutritional sciences at the<br>University of our hosts in dirt and<br>Denmark and a lecturer at the Ecole<br>Polytechnique<br>federal no Sun both of them amongst<br>other things<br>teaching nutrigenomics so by now man's<br>worked in at least five different<br>countries speaks four different<br>languages fluently in a smattering of a<br>few others has acquired extensive<br>experience in pharmaceuticals nutrition<br>biotech startups as well as course all<br>those omics this was clearly all the<br>perfect preparation for a new challenge<br>how far away could he go this time so<br>came across the world as far as it was<br>possible to take up an appointment at<br>the University of Auckland in 2016 as<br>the professor of systems biology in<br>nutrition and health at the Liggins<br>Institute and a scientific director of<br>the high value nutrition national<br>science challenge Martyn has authored<br>more than 130 publications<br>he's in-demand internationally as an<br>author and speaker he serves on the<br>science advisory boards of Keystone's<br>symposia and human proteome organization<br>and the omics group and his list of<br>editorial boards won't surprise you if<br>you tell you amongst others they are<br>frontiers of genes and nutrition applied<br>in transnational genomics the Journal of<br>proteomics the omics journal of<br>integrated biology and the Journal of<br>integrated omics several of which I had<br>not heard of before in fact if you<br>hadn't noticed by now he knows quite a<br>bit about omics and he's also not very<br>good at staying in one place but he is<br>very good at being collaborative and<br>talking to lots of people so much so<br>that the first public lecture he gave<br>here in Auckland included in the<br>audience a couple of people whose only<br>link to the topic or the University was<br>that Martin had got to chatting them in<br>a surf shop the day before<br>so if any stray surfies in the audience<br>tonight you're most welcome it's a great<br>pleasure to welcome Martin here in his<br>inaugural lecture he's going to<br>introduce us to his world of systems<br>biology and omics and also explained to<br>us why a science career plan does not<br>make sense ladies and gentlemen please<br>good evening there's not much left to<br>talk about Jenny said everything I<br>should say kia ora i speak a few<br>languages but i had a very strong accent<br>when i speak Maori so the rest will be<br>in English I am particularly honored to<br>wear this not only because it's the<br>colours of the University it's also the<br>colours of Germany action and I would<br>like to take you now through my talk<br>which has a bit of an unusual title Oh<br>can I can I can I do this delivery<br>without that hat because I'm so excited<br>and I'm already I'm already a little<br>sweaty so this is by no means a lack of<br>respect but I feel a little more<br>comfortable so I want to take you<br>through a talk that is entirely<br>science-y a science career plan does in<br>my view not make sense and I will also<br>take you through a sunrise over Monument<br>Valley some of you have seen this<br>already so my apologies but this is<br>dedicated to my parents because we were<br>there in 1983 and also to my family we<br>were there last year so I chose this<br>title let's see whether this this works<br>here<br>there you go I've chosen this title<br>because unlike some corporate thinking<br>about Human Resources and I come from a<br>more corporate world where people think<br>you can plan your career I think that<br>really doesn't work<br>I believe that especially in science the<br>your career path or your your way of<br>life is basically in my view a result of<br>an interaction between your passion and<br>your exposure<br>so basically whom you meet on your way<br>and where you live and this is in my<br>view nice analogy to gene-environment<br>interactions we are today studying where<br>we thought and I will come to this theme<br>as we go along there genes will explain<br>basically your destiny in terms of<br>health and future but it's not quite as<br>simple as that<br>it's gene environment interactions and<br>this is the reason for the the title of<br>that of the talk so here we have a<br>little outlook so I will spend a little<br>bit of time to share with you my way of<br>at least a professional life and then go<br>into some aspects of genomics also the<br>personal aspects and then this is really<br>of course my shtick you know know<br>everything here from Jane mass spec and<br>omics allude to the theme of systems<br>biology and bring some examples along as<br>we go and then also spend some time on<br>actual work that is now being carried<br>out in my group here at the at elegans<br>so my way of life looks approximately as<br>follows actually I can skip that slide<br>because you said everything you know I'm<br>born in Germany I did my studies in<br>arcanine Constance it's all done I was<br>in I was in San Francisco and then I<br>joined the Vikings actually actually<br>this I first went to Denmark a dentistry<br>in there was the only little thing that<br>I could maybe add to what you said and<br>then I went to different places in<br>Switzerland I cannot add more national<br>flags only Canton all flags the<br>accountants are the little States<br>federal states of Switzerland<br>and then I join Nestle and by that time<br>I also got affiliated with the Danish<br>University and almost and then I landed<br>here in in New Zealand so that's my way<br>of professional life and do you think<br>there is a science career plan behind us<br>I don't think so<br>and I will try to explain why I do not<br>think so and why it has come this way so<br>I came from Switzerland to this place<br>and this is probably drawn to scale not<br>in terms of volume so Switzerland is a<br>very small country but very large in<br>terms of volume so if you flat it out is<br>actually much bigger than there it's<br>much bigger than New Zealand so I joined<br>the elegant Institute because I think<br>this is one of the most meaningful<br>things to work on this early life health<br>it's much better to work on something to<br>get it right in the first place to<br>prevent disease and to maintain health<br>then only focusing on repair of course<br>we also must do repair and this is my<br>second head is not like this but my<br>second head is function is to<br>scientifically direct a national science<br>challenge a high Valley nutrition and<br>that is one of eleven challenges in New<br>Zealand here I think it's one of the<br>largest and this is about basic<br>translational nutritional science and<br>innovation in in in the food sector and<br>I would not be here if I hadn't met<br>three wise men and I would like to thank<br>those those people in the beginning of<br>my talk and I will thank many other<br>people as we go along the first guy I<br>would like to thank is Peter up stuff he<br>is a Viking he is a sailor<br>he's a chain-smoker and he's in perfect<br>health and he is the father of mass spec<br>based peptide and protein sequencing<br>actually he published a paper on the<br>nomenclature of ions that are generated<br>when you put peptides in the mass<br>spectrometer and you break it into<br>pieces and this follows certain rules<br>it's not a random process<br>so Peter introduced me to<br>a mass spec and and protein and peptide<br>sequencing and I found this fascinating<br>because this was a way I mean when these<br>instruments came about this was a way to<br>all of a sudden make biology much more<br>molecular than it has been possible<br>before his professor still at the<br>University of Southern Denmark and he<br>hired me as a as a postdoc the second<br>person I'd like to thank is Danny host<br>rasa he is Swiss French which means he<br>is Swiss but french-speaking he is the<br>father of clinical proteomics and I<br>worked with him for the biotech in in in<br>Geneva and that was one of the first if<br>not the first industrial biotechnology<br>company that was doing blood plasma<br>proteomics for biomarker discovery in<br>cardiovascular disease and this was a<br>collaboration with Novartis he's a very<br>good skier and I was I shared a passion<br>for sailing with Peter and the passion<br>for skiing with with Denny and his<br>professor at the University of Geneva<br>still and the third gentleman I'd like<br>to say his lawn fair he is a Frenchman<br>also a very good skier and a wind surfer<br>and we will come to that theme as we go<br>along I would call him the father of<br>molecular nutrition so I have a lot of<br>fathers beside my own father who sits<br>here they know none of them comes as<br>near anywhere close but I have a number<br>of professional fathers and and long<br>hired me at Nestle as Jane said and he<br>is now head of the infant nutrition R&amp;D<br>at Nestle so without these three guys I<br>wouldn't be standing here now when you<br>meet all these mentors it's important<br>for you because it has an impact the<br>mentor always sets the example right<br>Peter here shows a very positive spirit<br>and he also was very much interested in<br>gene-environment interactions and<br>promoting a very healthy lifestyle here<br>and so as we come along we will see what<br>kind of influence that had on my<br>preceding so the theme here is jeans<br>early nutrition and health and there are<br>many reasons why I think we are now<br>doing this research as we do it today I<br>come I will come to the Human Genome<br>Project in a minute but one of the<br>sobering results of the Human Genome<br>Project was it's only 23,000 genes<br>that's not much more than the fruit fly<br>and by all respect for the fly I think<br>there is a little bit different of<br>complexity these genes cannot explain<br>human complexity and individuality<br>rather it is the interaction of your<br>genotype of your genotype with the<br>environment that makes your phenotype<br>and this is what we're looking is today<br>another key thing that brought me here<br>is that nutrition has the most lifelong<br>health impact and that early life<br>influences later life and this all comes<br>together for a philosophy where we can<br>maintain health and prevent disease and<br>these were five good reasons for me to<br>come here now let's spend a bit of a<br>moment on personal genomics this is<br>actually an outdated paper now the human<br>genome is a disease 17 and the order one<br>of us still remember when it was<br>published Bill Clinton was there and<br>craig Venter and the public consortium<br>there were basically two competing<br>consoles yeah I mean basically one<br>company and a consortium were competing<br>and they published at the same time what<br>we now would call the an average human<br>genome sequence in just a human but but<br>there was such a milestone and there was<br>very there were very high expectations<br>in terms of disease prevention at that<br>time and I had actually the chance to<br>meet craig Venter in person eleven years<br>later when he came to Nestle it's a<br>pretty impressive personality and he has<br>institutes in in the US and so there was<br>this publication of these 23,000 gene<br>containing genome where and we heard<br>this morning that most of the genome<br>sequence is non-coding which means it<br>doesn't most of the sequence doesn't<br>code for any proteins so what is all the<br>rest about and the<br>publication and this milestone in<br>science has triggered a lot of also<br>commercial and consumer health output in<br>the sense that companies were born that<br>would sequence you in terms of genes and<br>then tell you something about your<br>health and disease risk and your<br>prospects of how to stay healthy or not<br>and 23andme I've been in touch with them<br>while I was with Nestle I this we had a<br>chance to discuss with them as one of<br>those companies but you basically take a<br>buccal swab and you can send it send it<br>in and they're sequence you so you have<br>your personal genome sequence and then<br>they come up with a risk score across<br>basically every kind of disease you can<br>imagine so everything that can go wrong<br>in your life except being hit by a<br>meteorite maybe so and these risk scores<br>are based on risk factors that are<br>associated with individual gene variants<br>and so basically variants of gene<br>sequence that has been statistically<br>associated with the risk of getting a<br>certain disease or not but what this<br>does not do so my question here is is<br>this really actionable and we have<br>discussed this this morning during the<br>student all-day during student day is<br>this pure sequence information<br>actionable and today we know it's not<br>sufficient to predict the future in<br>terms of health and and and and disease<br>because what this information not does<br>not consider as gene gene interactions<br>not so much at least not what 23andme<br>does and gene environment interactions<br>so it's much more complicated than that<br>now that was one of the reasons why I<br>got so fond of proteomics and this is<br>just a slide - I think that nicely<br>illustrates in simple terms what's the<br>difference these two different stages of<br>life have the same genomes but different<br>proteome so it's the same sequence of<br>genes that are but different genes are<br>made use of in different phases in<br>development and this is why we study<br>this learning from the example has<br>always been very important so you can<br>see here that my mentor had a very good<br>influence I show here<br>the positive spirit definitely is<br>smeared off and I very readily adopted<br>the lifestyle of the Vikings with beer<br>and some nicotine so this was a very<br>positive influence now the the the next<br>part of my talk is now about the tools<br>and that enables the omics Sciences<br>downstream of genomics and especially in<br>mass spectrometry and I would like to<br>take you through some examples here I<br>have grown up with Pink Floyd I think<br>it's the greatest rock band ever I'm<br>very content and proud that my son's<br>also like Pink Floyd so they have a<br>really good taste but Pink Floyd is not<br>only the best rock band ever they're<br>also very visionary in explaining mass<br>spectrometry but they didn't know at<br>that time so basically what mass<br>spectrometry does is you have here a<br>beam of ions let's say peptides and then<br>you separate them according to mass much<br>like the prism separates spreads out the<br>different wavelengths of the light<br>spectrum so here it's all one beam and<br>there you can separate things by mass<br>and even tandem mass spectrometry has<br>been really envisaged here because what<br>you can then do is you can pick one of<br>those separate masses and sequence it<br>down into the amino acids so you have a<br>stream of peptides here pick one<br>peptides and sequence this into the<br>amino acids and this is the analogy of<br>genome sequencing it's just much more<br>complicated in terms of technique and<br>it's unfortunately not as fast and<br>simple so now let me take you through a<br>few examples of how proteomics came<br>along and that makes me really feel all<br>because if you if you look back what you<br>have been working on yourself you you<br>realize the technological progress over<br>that time it's it's incredible so<br>proteomics in inverted commas 1997<br>looked like this I was working at the<br>apostille at the University of Constance<br>and then I moved to Denmark to join PETA<br>because we were very fond of a<br>urals cell adhesion protein in neural in<br>which is involved in neural regeneration<br>in fish so fish can regenerate certain<br>nerves and we know that we cannot so<br>this has a tremendous interest in in<br>medicine and there is a model as a fish<br>model where you basically cut the nerve<br>that connects the eye with the brain and<br>there is a regeneration process that can<br>restore this connection and fish can do<br>that and new urlan was involved in this<br>in this process and we were interested<br>in its primary structure because some of<br>the function of this protein was due to<br>glycosylation and these glycosylation<br>was specific for certain interactions so<br>what this paper is about is about one<br>protein and we sequenced the heck out of<br>it so the basically the whole amino acid<br>sequence and we knew where the<br>glycosylation was paper done bone cohosh<br>if you want to publish this today<br>because it's one protein of course you<br>have all the information of the primary<br>structure but still we worked on one<br>protein and this was a quite a kind of a<br>big deal a few years later when I worked<br>in the biotech that was founded by Denny<br>we've been going into much larger scale<br>proteomics in the sense that we took<br>lots and lots of blood of a pooled<br>sample from several donors in order to<br>identify as many proteins as possible<br>and then we would go into the individual<br>samples of the patients we had and<br>controls to see which biomarkers were in<br>which sample so there was first an<br>identification database building phase<br>and then there was a phase where we try<br>to understand who was at an elevated<br>risk of cardiovascular disease versus a<br>lower risk of cardiovascular disease<br>based on these biomarkers and then that<br>was based on 55 zero mass spectrometers<br>and lots of robots and we also<br>synthesized them some of these markers<br>and targets that we had identified by<br>chemical means so this is not<br>recombinant expression of proteins in<br>cells or bacteria but with these<br>chemical synthesis so what you can<br>basically do is you can synthesize<br>large pieces of polypeptides and then<br>ligate them in the order you would like<br>to do it and the reason why we did it<br>chemically at the time was that the<br>purity and the yield is much higher than<br>an expression system is also when you<br>have the tools it's much cheaper so this<br>was quite a difference in in terms of<br>what you would do in terms of proteomics<br>and very recently when I was at Nestle<br>and I had this fairly loose team there<br>we were going into biomarker discovery<br>in human plasma and this was more about<br>not so not so much about how many<br>proteins can you see how many process<br>insulation modifications can you see in<br>the academic proteomics world the race<br>for protein numbers is very much on but<br>what people have I think<br>underestimated is how difficult it is to<br>analyze a significant number of samples<br>in a significant in a reasonable amount<br>of time so how do you deal with<br>large-scale clinical studies because<br>proteomics is much slower than genomics<br>that's very that's that's for sure so we<br>came up with a workflow that was based<br>on a bio arranged from bio banking to<br>tandem a spec a data analysis here and I<br>will cite an example of application of<br>this workflow as we go through the<br>presentation so this is another I think<br>dimension because proteomics now becomes<br>more relevant for clinical research for<br>those of the PhD students that want to<br>do a postdoc be aware it's tough<br>physically and very tiring so I will<br>come to that theme as we go along but a<br>postdoc is always a big challenge and I<br>have myself experienced that now the<br>fourth part of my talk is I can't of<br>course resist on talking about systems<br>biology and my partner-in-crime and my<br>boss in the high very nutrition<br>challenge to joy and thought who is also<br>in the audience is has by now means I<br>think converted in the systems biology<br>to the ologist to so systems biology I<br>would like to spend a few moments about<br>to under<br>to share my view about what this is and<br>why we need it so some of you know that<br>slide but I think it's still a good<br>introduction of what it really means<br>biological systems have been in for many<br>years and from most of the molecular<br>biology research I think been studied in<br>in the way that we would analyze the<br>individual parts so you have here<br>basically a disassembled car and this is<br>what is called reductionist approach so<br>you learn about the bits and pieces<br>about the system but you study them<br>individually okay<br>and that gives of course the basis of<br>the key knowledge for more systems<br>oriented approaches but it's still a<br>study of individual elements now again I<br>say this I should change the slide and<br>in terms of the diesel scandal but I<br>come from Germany so I keep still the<br>the VW slide here systems have emergent<br>properties that cannot be predicted by<br>adding basically the properties of the<br>individual parts that's not possible the<br>sum is greater than the whole is greater<br>than the sum of the parts that's the<br>connotation of systems biology and this<br>is actually particularly true for<br>nutrition so nutrition is in my view one<br>of the best cases I'm wandering around<br>too much right I'm stressing the camera<br>man you I can see he's I'm very excited<br>about what I do so I never stay in one<br>place it's a bit like Heisenberg you can<br>never tell place and time at the same<br>moment so that's you have to get used to<br>that so the point here is that nutrition<br>is a prime case of for systems biology<br>and we can even coined the word systems<br>nutrition because we do not eat<br>ingredients we do not eat nutrients we<br>eat diets okay so it all comes together<br>and it all interacts so if you look at<br>individual components at a time it's<br>just not good enough so for those of you<br>who are a little further away for<br>example my dad is a lawyer so he<br>understands everything I'm talking about<br>but just maybe just a little analogy<br>that helps<br>those of you that are not too much into<br>that kind of science I think distance<br>biology you can look at it as a language<br>of life where you basically have an<br>analogy here you have an increasing<br>complexity so let's say we have here the<br>bases that are the building blocks of<br>the genes here we have two genes the<br>genome that express other ohm's as we go<br>further up in complexity and systems<br>biology at least in the molecular terms<br>embraces everything and it's a little<br>bit like when you go from letters to<br>words to vocabulary to grammar to<br>language so it's a matter of at which<br>level you want to study the system and<br>how detailed you can study it at this<br>complexity level systems biology can for<br>example characterize the relationship<br>between diet microbiota and host<br>phenotype and we are doing this here at<br>the ligands and also in conjunction with<br>external partners so this is a one of<br>those examples where you can see diet is<br>complex in terms of composition<br>microbiota these are the bacteria that<br>colonize your your your body you're<br>actually a eukaryotic minority in a<br>prokaryotic ecosystem so you just<br>guessed in a ecosystem of bacteria when<br>it comes to cell numbers and there are<br>other people here in the room that know<br>much more about this so if you want to<br>study the relationship between diet this<br>ecosystem and especially the ecosystem<br>in the gut and what is the resulting<br>phenotypes or phenotype is basically a<br>collection of observable traits and<br>characteristics of an organism systems<br>biology is a good case and I imagine you<br>can do this at several levels so and<br>this is what we would we can call<br>molecular phenotyping I've been spending<br>quite some time on on the genomics part<br>on the proteomics part but there are<br>other omics and everything ends up<br>essentially in a complex picture of what<br>makes you up as an individual in a given<br>situation and we have now we are live<br>now in a situation where we can measure<br>all these things and that hasn't been<br>possible for a long time<br>so now I take you through a few examples<br>of how this molecular phenotyping can<br>generate useful information<br>in one of the pioneers of this was<br>Michael Snyder<br>I'd like to cite his paper and this is<br>the personal omics profiling paper what<br>Michael Snyder did is he analyzed<br>himself over time from all different<br>kind of angles this is from an ethics<br>point of view actually a very good idea<br>because you can get it filed pretty<br>easily because you don't have to ask all<br>the participants you just measure<br>yourself that was one of the reasons why<br>he did it<br>and of course from a technology point of<br>view an interpretation point of view<br>it's very complex and I don't want to<br>take you into too much detail about what<br>he actually did is he all makes<br>basically himself from all different<br>kind of angles plus he did clinical<br>monitoring over time he obviously was<br>observing himself over time and with all<br>these techniques we have discussed<br>before and one of the interesting<br>outputs of this of this exercise was<br>that he could discover that there was an<br>infectious an infection event in his in<br>his trajectory that caused a<br>pre-diabetic State and then he could<br>correct for this by nutritional<br>adaptation and retrospectively this<br>omics signature appeared earlier then as<br>if he had waited for this pre-diabetic<br>state to occur with classical diagnostic<br>means so for example when you are<br>transiently glucose intolerant and and<br>you make the classical test so this was<br>one example of this multi-angle self<br>observation over time we could see okay<br>there was a moment in time where an<br>infection caused the metabolic state<br>that is not healthy and I can correct<br>for it for bye-bye nutritional means my<br>groups have also worked on this<br>molecular phenotyping in different<br>contexts and one example here is infant<br>health and here we have looked at<br>breastfeeding breastfed infants and<br>infants that were fed either a high or<br>low protein formula and these infants<br>were all born from overweight and obese<br>mothers and we did this with<br>metabolomics techniques for once not<br>with mass spectrometry but with any mass<br>spectroscopy that doesn't matter so much<br>because the concept is the same so what<br>you see here on the slide is basically<br>bars of different colors and they are<br>grouped so the different colors<br>basically mean the different feeding<br>regimen so either the kids were the<br>infants were breastfed or they received<br>a high or low protein formula these are<br>the colors and the three different bars<br>here means time points three six twelve<br>months so what you can do is in the<br>metabolic space is you you measure all<br>these small molecules typically in urine<br>or also in feces so you have to be<br>minimally invasive especially when you<br>work with infants and you measure these<br>molecules over time and then you can ask<br>the question what happens over time and<br>if you integrate this information in<br>this particular case we could for<br>example see that the breastfed infants<br>differed from the formula fed infants at<br>different levels of of metabolism<br>carbohydrate metabolism energy<br>metabolism lipid metabolism and you can<br>see here a few details where these<br>differences were observed for example of<br>course breastfed infants showed make<br>illegal saccharides in the stool because<br>only human breast milk has these complex<br>oligosaccharides that can actually give<br>rise to Bennett to the growth of health<br>beneficial bacteria in early life infant<br>guts so this is just gives you a flavor<br>of what you can do and this is something<br>also what we do here at the ligands<br>another example is in the<br>gastrointestinal health and here we<br>looked at children that were either<br>healthy or affected by IBD and ib d<br>stands for inflammatory bowel disease<br>when children are affected by<br>inflammatory bowel disease it's actually<br>very problematic not only because the<br>gut is causes a lot of pain but also<br>they don't grow well they don't dwell<br>they can stand actually and they don't<br>develop as they should so if the if you<br>do not diagnose and correct for IBD in<br>children they simply don't develop as<br>they should and here we also did<br>metabolomics exercise so we<br>invasive took samples from urine and and<br>other sources and then what you can do<br>is you can see where do your metabolites<br>fall on to in terms of biochemical<br>pathways and where do you see the most<br>significant changes and here the<br>take-home message is that this<br>non-invasive urine sampling and the<br>longitudinal design which means you<br>looked at the same infant over time so<br>you observed healthy children over time<br>how they grew and the IBD affected<br>children over time how they grow you can<br>identify molecular profiles that are<br>actually linked to specific deficits<br>that are observed in IBD affected<br>children and then you can correct for<br>them so you can see where the metabolism<br>differs between the disease and the<br>healthy infants and you can<br>nutritionally intervene to compensate<br>for these for example observations that<br>have to do with Mal absorption of<br>certain nutrients i believe children<br>have usually problems with absorbing<br>nutrients in sufficient quantities a<br>further example here is about the<br>metabolic health area and here we have<br>studied a large cohort of overweight<br>subjects in an european and<br>collaborative study and and my ex<br>colleagues are still working on on these<br>data so here we have recruited obese<br>subjects at a certain moment in time and<br>then they were screened then they were<br>put on a weight-loss diet and then they<br>were put on four different diets in<br>order to see who is able to maintain the<br>weight or who regains weight or who<br>further loses weight when this weight<br>loss diet has been had been completed so<br>you don't need all mix to know that if<br>you are an 800 kilo calories per day you<br>lose weight I'm glad I was not part of<br>that study that's not much but what the<br>interesting thing is that usually it's<br>so difficult to keep the weight off once<br>you have lost it<br>and if we had analyzed this this these<br>individuals in a classical fashion<br>basically by group so you say the<br>individuals around high-protein low GI<br>low protein high GI and all the<br>permutations we had four different diets<br>then you would have said okay on average<br>high protein and low GI is better than<br>the other diets well that we knew before<br>but when you look at individuals is that<br>in each and every dietary intervention<br>group all trajectories were present so<br>there were successful people in all<br>different groups and there were non<br>successful people in all different<br>groups and one of the questions we had<br>is can we predict this success can we<br>say what happens here at this baseline<br>and yes we can to cite American<br>president who is unfortunately longer in<br>charge but that's a different story so<br>we can cite a weekend we can say we can<br>do this in the sense that we can tell a<br>baseline based on a proteomic signature<br>that we derived from human blood plasma<br>and that was exactly the workflow I have<br>shown you before<br>remember the an analysis of the thousand<br>samples in a clinical in a clinical<br>study this was exactly the tools that<br>were used to address this and so we can<br>say here a signature a protein signature<br>at baseline at time zero consisting of<br>23 different markers can tell you who<br>should actually use which diet in order<br>to be successful we also have been<br>working on cognition that is something<br>that this may be not so present here at<br>the ligands but in terms of infant<br>development definitely yes<br>and here we developed a panel of<br>analytes that are involved in metabolic<br>are involved in the 1 carbon metabolism<br>1 carbon metabolism is a key pathway in<br>the body that provides the body with the<br>building blocks of of one carbon units<br>and we worked here on cognitive decline<br>and so we had a cohort of people of<br>elderly people that were either on<br>declining cognitively or mentally<br>performing consistently over time so we<br>had different time points and here the<br>message is that we know that high<br>homocysteine levels and especially in<br>CSF so this is cerebral cerebral spinal<br>fluid that's the fluid that surrounds<br>the Blayne brain and is is also in the<br>in the spinal cord that is a risk factor<br>for cognitive decline and dementia and<br>also this includes Alzheimer's disease<br>and there's currently in the clinics<br>there is a reference model being applied<br>a reference model means it's a<br>collection of data points that are<br>statistically interpreted and and that<br>are used for diagnosis and this includes<br>age so aging is not good<br>unfortunately years of education a beta<br>one 242 stands for NL or beta peptide<br>and that is a feature of Alzheimer's<br>disease where this peptide is miss<br>cleaved and causes plaques and these are<br>is another protein which is erroneously<br>phosphorylated and not the way it should<br>be phosphorylated and if you look at<br>this classical model the diagnostic<br>accuracy is about eighty percent so we<br>came up with two models based on either<br>CSF derived or plasma derived<br>metabolites of the one carbon metabolism<br>and because this is a molecularly<br>speaking quite a complex panel we could<br>we could tap into and we could<br>analytically<br>grasp we could we can see here that our<br>diagnostic accuracy actually surpassed<br>the one with a classical model now this<br>is of course to be very dated in other<br>cohorts but this is a good example of<br>where molecular phenotyping can be also<br>very useful for Diagnostics in if you<br>display this in another way you can see<br>here when you have these graphs here<br>that basically plot the true positive<br>rate over the false positive rate so<br>this means sensitivity versus<br>specificity if you have here a diagonal<br>this is flipping a coin so this is just<br>chance you can't tell anything and you<br>want this area under that curve to be<br>very very large so the larger this area<br>is the better the predictive power and<br>you can see here that our model performs<br>better than the reference model and we<br>have a subsequent paper now on going<br>also in Alzheimer's research and therapy<br>where we did this plasma and values so<br>also other scientists fund of mass spec<br>and I hope for the yuba now the same it<br>is also used in forensics so it's just<br>to underline the power of this<br>technology am i okay with time it's the<br>last last parts all right yeah I<br>wouldn't tell it anyway so I mean so I<br>would now like to tell you a little bit<br>what the group my relatively new group<br>here the ligands is doing you have been<br>some of you may have been listening to<br>sheekha's talk about human breast milk<br>and infant health outcomes<br>she gave a public lecture the other day<br>you may have heard stephanie speaking<br>this morning about early life cell-free<br>DNA diagnostics to grasp to capture<br>influences of maternal nutrition on<br>early life health and what i would like<br>to present here is actually a project<br>that is funded by high-value trician by<br>the national science challenge and<br>claire wall is also in the room and the<br>two of us we are running this Claire is<br>a pediatrician and a nutritionist and<br>I try to bring this or make stuff into<br>the game so we are interested in weaning<br>that is at the moment or the period in<br>life we are either breastfeeding or<br>formula feeding in infants is being<br>phased out and the introduction of solid<br>foods is gradually being phased in and<br>that typically happens it's culturally a<br>bit dependent here I think it happens<br>around six months of age in other<br>countries it may be later but this is<br>what it is about and because you change<br>food dramatically also the microbiome<br>changes and the microbiome especially<br>those bacteria that are residing in the<br>gut so this graph or this illustration<br>just summarizes a bit the influences<br>that determine and can influence and<br>later life microbiome especially in<br>intestinal microbiome so we have here<br>birth the first year of life and then<br>the total age we are also speaking about<br>the first thousand days of life that are<br>very important that's approximately<br>three years so there are maternal<br>factors postnatal factors and even later<br>factors that influence the microbiome so<br>there's gut microbiota from the mother<br>there's there's vagina<br>microbiota then the birth delivery<br>matters whether it's for journal or<br>caesarean that has an influence on the<br>composition and then here we are in the<br>weaning space where solid food is<br>introduced and of course these bacteria<br>live also on what we eat so they are<br>commensals they're at the table and this<br>has a strong influence about the later<br>life immune immune and metabolic health<br>as the microbiome changes so the<br>copyright for this title goes to Frank<br>and Frank said why don't why don't you<br>call it sealing so feeling I think this<br>is a real cool project title and maybe<br>it helped us defending it getting funded<br>by high-value nutrition so we had the<br>question whether we can promote healthy<br>immunity in infants around weaning by<br>feeding immune beneficial bacteria as<br>members of the infant gut microbiome<br>that was the essential question we had<br>and the classical approach would have<br>been feed and bleed or you could say<br>testing prebiotic candidates so there<br>it's not like we don't know anything<br>about it we have we have we know that<br>some prebiotic and prebiotics basically<br>means it's a nutrient for probiotic and<br>probiotic means is a health beneficial<br>bacteria so these are the three names<br>you out terms you have to remember so<br>the classical approach would be feeding<br>and bleeding which means testing<br>candidates but we had there will be the<br>classical workflow here but our approach<br>was different we said well we would like<br>to go about it with reverse genomics<br>which means we define a health benefit<br>we ask what part of the ecosystem in the<br>gut could contribute to this health<br>benefit and then we ask the question on<br>which prebiotics do these bacteria feed<br>and where we can find this feed in the<br>in the food space so it's working from<br>the benefit and backwards rather than<br>testing and see what happens and I think<br>we have by now although the project is<br>still very young a nice proof-of-concept<br>and we work here together with kospi<br>which is a systems biology Institute in<br>in Italy and Bijou I don't know whether<br>he's in the room<br>he's a postdoc in my group and he's<br>driving this so what we basically did is<br>we went to the public domain and<br>bioinformatics search for good food for<br>good bugs and what does this mean well<br>this is a sophisticated shows it's a<br>little more sophisticated than PubMed so<br>what Cosby has is essentially they can<br>develop vocabularies dictionaries and<br>they can develop intelligent text mining<br>for text mining tools in order to<br>retrieve information from the public<br>domain that you could never retrieve by<br>reading all these papers because it's<br>just impossible to do so we went through<br>about 30 37 thousand PubMed microbiome<br>publications and you can see how big<br>this this this space is<br>this search yielded approximately 2,000<br>papers that were related to infant gut<br>microbiome and immunity because this was<br>our health benefit we were focusing on<br>we were interested in bacteria that can<br>protect infants from infections so the<br>outcome would be infants have less or<br>fewer infections then we boiled it down<br>to about fifty bacterial genera and<br>about which correspond to about 500<br>bacterial species in the human gut<br>around that time in life and ten of<br>these bacterial genera and 50 of these<br>species were specifically related to<br>infant gut microbiome and immunity so<br>you basically study all or retrieve all<br>the microbiome studies that have been<br>published and you boil it down to what<br>matters for your research question and<br>the nice thing about this approach is<br>not only did we discover of course new<br>candidate we also found things we were<br>expected to find so this is like in<br>analytics if you if you if you want to<br>discover new biomarkers you better make<br>sure that you see molecules and markets<br>that you are expected to see<br>so you're sensitive and specific enough<br>so lactobacillus and bifidobacteria for<br>example we found and then you can try to<br>illustrate this and you know this is one<br>of those slides where one used to say i<br>don't want to go into detail which means<br>you can't read it but what my point here<br>is that we have basically wheels of<br>interactions or connections where on the<br>one hand we have the bacteria and if<br>it's health but health beneficial we can<br>say probiotics on the other side we have<br>the nutrients of prebiotics and then we<br>can zoom in and try to understand who<br>feeds on what and for example here you<br>can actually I think you can read it<br>with a little bit of fantasy that the<br>Bifidobacterium longum feeds for example<br>among many other nutrients on air runny<br>nose which is a fairly simple sugar and<br>what you can also do is when you have<br>these wheels of connections you can ask<br>the question of competition so our<br>different bugs competing for the same<br>nutrients and you can also ask the<br>question whereas cooperativity so some<br>new some bacteria provide nutrients for<br>others so this is more the ecosystem<br>perspect<br>so it's too simple to say well we find a<br>bug that we can feed and the Bacchus has<br>a health benefit we also need to<br>consider the ecological context and then<br>you can ask the question where where do<br>we find the nutrients that are so<br>attractive so again you have here the<br>nutrients of prebiotics here the food<br>sources then you can zoom in and for<br>example you can see here that the what<br>is it here the common walnut contains<br>sisters thigh on as a prebiotic nutrient<br>and you can do this in many other ways<br>so we are now going through this kind of<br>information and this discovery approach<br>or this in silico approach has informed<br>the design of the complementary feed<br>that we are now designing in a clinical<br>trial where we feed about 50 infants<br>with a prebiotic whole food and we came<br>up with kumara as a good source of some<br>of these prebiotics we have found and so<br>this approach can inform the design of<br>the complementary or weaning food that<br>we are now applying in a clinical trial<br>to see whether we can whether we can<br>have success in seeding the right<br>bacteria with the right food I come to<br>pretty much the end of the talk by just<br>summarizing a little bit where we stand<br>so I would just like to highlight this<br>collaborative paper here that has tried<br>to define some major nutrition research<br>goals of the years to come and so just<br>to say that I believe that with this<br>kind of research it's it's more than<br>having a few good ideas over a nice<br>glass of Sauvignon and from Marlborough<br>Sounds so I think we are pretty much<br>spot on then because if you look at what<br>the nutrition research community thinks<br>is it's something we need to do is first<br>of all it's identifying and mitigating<br>the errors in nutritional science and<br>errors and nutritional science<br>traditionally I think have been many due<br>to too much reductionism and also maybe<br>a little too little in No<br>of clinical design so we are very much<br>locked into case control designs based<br>on limited phenotyping so longitudinal<br>studies where you are your own case and<br>control can contribute to change that<br>second theme that was mentioned<br>nourishing the immune system of course<br>you have seen examples that we are<br>working on this human of microbiome I<br>think there's no grant that can be<br>written without mentioning this it is<br>definitely something which is on top of<br>the nutrition research agenda and then<br>of course it's a lot about big data and<br>it's not only storing the data and<br>making them accessible it's interpreting<br>these data because you can imagine of<br>that from all these different toolboxes<br>there is an enormous set of data energy<br>but that doesn't necessarily mean<br>information we have to convert it to<br>information so I I will wrap up now by I<br>think maybe sharing a few statements for<br>the young folks in the in the room here<br>I think there has never been a better<br>time for doing science because the<br>bottleneck has been moving from<br>basically the laboratory to the brain I<br>think not so long ago it was difficult<br>to measure things and now we can<br>actually measure many more things than<br>our brain can digest so this means<br>scientific brains are needed more than<br>ever because interpretation cannot be<br>automated I mean you can use you can use<br>computers of course for and and<br>algorithms and programs to visualize<br>things it may not see but you need to<br>interpret it a few words I would like to<br>say for those that are still at their<br>early career face and I wish I was there<br>still I think you should follow your<br>passion you should be mobile and I think<br>there is no such thing that science is<br>either applied and a bit more boring but<br>you get industry money for it or it's<br>more sexy and more academic but it's<br>very difficult to get funded I mean<br>sciences I think has to be excellent and<br>relevant and if it's excellent relevant<br>at the same time it's going to be picked<br>up I think working at interfaces is<br>always a very exciting<br>idea I've been spending a lot of time at<br>the public private interface and I'm<br>doing this year as well so how very<br>nutrition has a lot of commercial spin<br>and at the same time we do a lot of<br>basic science here at the ligands well<br>that's a very you know the human factors<br>I think it's very important to build and<br>maintain good relationships and also to<br>choose good mentors as we have seen<br>because they can have such a wonderful<br>influence on you I hope this is my<br>summer summary of about 45 minutes I<br>think this was the prey the most awarded<br>banner during the march of science in<br>the US where a lot of people were a bit<br>concerned about what would happen to<br>science in with the new administration I<br>would like to thank my ex team at Nestle<br>they have been I mean most of the things<br>I have presented still stems off from<br>that time I would also of course warmly<br>thanked my new team here at the ligands<br>with some very recent additions and we<br>can never be on the same photo because<br>always somebody is not here so thank you<br>to those wonderful people that made it<br>possible here to start my research here<br>at the at the ligands in hvn I would<br>like to thank my family some of them are<br>here in the room they have been<br>supporting me of all these long all this<br>journey and I would like to come back to<br>the central theme of my talk and still<br>say you can still do it as a professor<br>now you can of course say well this<br>could be anybody but because you cannot<br>recognize me but the author the<br>copyright of this video sits in the room<br>that yonas who is by now the much better<br>wind surfer but if we have doubts who<br>that is I think he can testify that it's<br>me thank you very much for staying with<br>me after such a long day and was<br>wonderful to to spend this moment with<br>I mean through your life technology<br>omics systems biology but how all those<br>things can interact together to make a<br>difference to health and you also headed<br>in the final part that makes a really<br>good inaugural lecture which is to be<br>sometimes a little bit controversial and<br>a little bit provocative by saying that<br>why a science plan doesn't make sense<br>and it was provocative enough such that<br>Radio New Zealand of books interviews<br>slot with Martin next week to find out<br>exactly what he means by that so the use<br>of title is cool now when they find out<br>about the story maybe their dog I think<br>they will base what we've heard tonight<br>I think they'll be very interesting<br>indeed so thank you again very much<br>thank you again Martin very much for<br>that wonderful lecture and it's great to<br>have you as a member the professorial</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
