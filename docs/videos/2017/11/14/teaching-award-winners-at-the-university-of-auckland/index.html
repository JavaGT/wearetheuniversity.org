font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>teaching means to me two things it's<br>firstly about the relationships that you<br>build with students and its secondly<br>about the learning environment that you<br>create for them I get a real buzz when I<br>see that students are not only able to<br>answer questions but they're able to<br>question answers for me it's one of the<br>most satisfying spaces is that exchange<br>of knowledge doesn't always go from the<br>teacher out but it's an environment<br>where knowledge has been exchanged Tracy<br>is someone I find easy to listen to<br>which helps me to understand what is<br>going on in lectures Tracy inspires I<br>think she inspires just about every<br>student that comes into contact with it<br>she's very clear and how she talks about<br>everything but I may not say something<br>out loud I feel like I've stopped<br>participating and my own hip I think<br>that University Walton has the<br>incredible breadth both in terms of what<br>it teaches but also in terms of the<br>student experience the fact that we're<br>in a hyper diverse City I think is much<br>more reflected in the University lecture<br>room than probably in many other spaces<br>as a Maori woman I really want us to be<br>able to benefit from that diversity the<br>University of Auckland is a great place<br>to teach because of its focus<br>particularly on research because it adds<br>a special colour to our teaching Murray<br>is a concoction of bubbly easygoing and<br>wise and friendly approach makes him the<br>most fantastic lecturer I have ever had<br>fundamental is the energy she brings<br>into the room she reaches out to the<br>students as an audience and invites them<br>to participate in the lesson it's not a<br>one-way street I really want for my<br>students to be able to understand the<br>world but to go beyond mere description<br>the real ideal is for them to recognize<br>their own ability to create positive and<br>sustain change a successful student as a<br>student who's really engaged and you can<br>feel that in a classroom these are real<br>buzz in the classroom and I think that<br>responding to what students have to say<br>and making that a fun and engage<br>environment I actually think that that's<br>what makes classrooms alive<br>Jay is a phenomenal teacher I'm sitting<br>here at lunch when we're all having a<br>laugh remember some of his best DJ is in<br>his very calm and slow southern American<br>accent which I've disguised over the<br>years<br>je after Lee has a gift of inspiring<br>people he comes across as being someone<br>who genuinely is interested in you as a<br>person and he can draw out people that<br>sometimes you've never even heard them<br>speak in a class or a lecture before if<br>I wasn't a teacher<br>the truth would I do I think without a<br>doubt if I wasn't a lecturer I'd be<br>doing really what my research area is to<br>look for largely indigenous solutions to<br>complex problems so that all of our<br>people can flourish if I wasn't working<br>in the tertiary teaching environment I'd<br>be still be working with communities of<br>interest trying to work towards positive<br>empowering and collaborative change well<br>I was a news a little bit I do it for<br>the pharmaceutical industry I live there<br>but I've got to be honest this is the<br>best job I've ever done<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
