with<br>a pom on OA grow rocketed amah tena koe<br>tow tena koe<br>anat otto katoa my name is Harlan hain<br>and I am extremely proud to be the vice<br>chancellor here at the University of<br>Otago and on behalf of the University I<br>would like to warmly welcome you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture for Holly<br>Buckley now at the beginning of the<br>academic year this year I had the<br>incredible privilege of welcoming our<br>scholarship recipients to the University<br>of Otago and there were literally<br>hundreds of them they represent some of<br>the brightest the most talented and the<br>most socially minded young people that<br>this country has to offer<br>and for each one of these welcomes the<br>academic staff and I wore our academic<br>regalia and I explained to the students<br>who were present at those ceremonies<br>that although these costumes used to be<br>worn by academics in the classroom now<br>we reserved them to very for very<br>special occasions so if you ever see us<br>dressed like this something very<br>important is about to happen so tonight<br>we are wearing academic regalia again<br>and something very important is about to<br>happen now the other sign that something<br>important is about to happen is that a<br>number of important people in Holly's<br>life have gathered with our University<br>of Otago community to celebrate her<br>promotion so on behalf of the University<br>I would like to extend a particularly<br>warm welcome to those individuals I'd<br>like to welcome her mother Leonie her<br>husband David and her stepchildren<br>Courtney and Oliver I would also like to<br>welcome a whole host of people in<br>Holly's life who have traveled from all<br>over the country in order to be with her<br>here this evening<br>Holly's uncle Richard has come from<br>Wellington her brother Karl and his wife<br>Judy and son Finnegan have come from<br>Invercargill aunty Carol and uncle Greg<br>have come from oamaru her sister and<br>brother-in-law Pauline and Graham have<br>come from Gore her auntie Julie has come<br>from Tonga her friends Vivian and Fattah<br>have come from Thames and her best<br>friends clarity Debbie and Emma<br>come from Auckland so what is so<br>important about promotion to professor<br>that warrants all this special clothing<br>and all of these special people<br>well the rank of Professor represents<br>the pinnacle of academic achievement and<br>at the University of Otago that<br>achievement is earned on the back of<br>years of sustained excellence in<br>research in teaching and in service<br>halli like all of our other professors<br>here at the University of Otago has<br>excelled in all three of those areas she<br>is an excellent scientist an extremely<br>popular and effective teacher and she<br>has provided excellent service to her<br>department and to her discipline she is<br>well known not only for the quality of<br>her research but also for her mentorship<br>of emerging scientists including both<br>postgraduate students and junior<br>academic staff members so Holly on<br>behalf of the University of Otago I<br>would like to warmly congratulate you on<br>your well-deserved promotion to<br>Professor I will now call on professor<br>Vernon ward the Dean of the School of<br>biomedical sciences to tell us just a<br>little bit more about Holly's path to<br>Professor Noir era 10 okoto 10 okoto<br>Thank You Vice Chancellor tena koutou<br>katoa<br>Aminu ET la cote welcome everybody to Le<br>Buckley's inaugural professorial lecture<br>I guess it's my task and privilege to<br>introduce Holly to you this evening and<br>I guess it's quite striking as I look<br>around here I was expecting to see a<br>broad range of people from across the<br>university and indeed that is very much<br>the case and I think that that wide<br>range of staff here is testament to the<br>broad range of collaboration and work<br>that Holly has done over an extended<br>period she's one of the leaders in the<br>biological anthropology research area in<br>the department of anatomy within the<br>school of biomedical sciences here at<br>Otago but I really want to emphasize the<br>strong collaborative base that she has<br>across and into humanities particularly<br>into anthropology and archaeology I<br>think it's a really strong example of<br>what the quality of research that can be<br>done and the things that can be<br>discovered when we work across cross and<br>multidisciplinary projects and programs<br>and bring a broad range of techniques<br>knowledge and people together I think<br>it's a shining example of what can be<br>done<br>so Holly for those who are underwear got<br>her PhD in Otago in 2001 and over the<br>intervening 16 years has developed a<br>very strong research program outstanding<br>teaching and our standing service as the<br>vice-chancellor has already mentioned<br>but I think I want to just illustrate<br>I've mentioned about collaboration and<br>some of the scope of what she has done<br>and I want to just add a few examples to<br>illustrate that so she's and the Otago<br>Global Health Institute as one of the<br>leaders of that she is needed to a real<br>board of Cambridge University Press the<br>president of the Australasian Society of<br>human biology a fellow of the Society of<br>Antiquaries member of the Paleo<br>pathology Society she's got<br>collaborations in Germany Canada<br>throughout the Pacific Papa New Guinea<br>here in New Zealand Otago and elsewhere<br>and it's really really quite amazing she<br>is one of the leading experts not only<br>in the asia-pacific region as she claims<br>herself but actually in the world in the<br>area of paleo pathology and with their<br>expertise in the Asia Pacific region<br>high range of multinational and<br>high-profile projects some of which<br>you'll see here through a whole<br>of different countries and I won't be<br>running through them all she's an<br>outstanding publication record at the<br>last count I have 60 journal<br>publications 20 chapters and three<br>entire books as what she's produced to<br>date she's made fundamental discoveries<br>in her field and as you'll see from<br>today's talk that these discoveries and<br>impacting not just on the history of<br>people but actually influencing our<br>understanding of disease and disease<br>processes particularly the Mary and<br>Pacific communities today what is<br>perhaps less well-known to many of you<br>is that she's a consultant forensic<br>consulting for the New Zealand policing<br>at times for the tsunami and has there's<br>a very large number of reports and work<br>in those systems and those are for those<br>of you that are scientists like<br>following various metrics those are the<br>sort of thing that don't mean to appear<br>in metrics but are and themselves<br>extremely important now I'm not going to<br>pre him to her talk I go through a lot<br>of what's there I think if you actually<br>look at what she's done with a broad<br>range of activities the research is done<br>the multidisciplinary component she's<br>put together you'll see those come<br>through the talk today and so with that<br>I would like to invite professor Buckley<br>to presenter a Naugle professor or<br>lecture entitled evolutionary medicine<br>how bio archeology can address health<br>mm tonight kruky hora<br>thank you all for being here briefly I<br>just want to start off by acknowledging<br>the tongue at afina one of the land that<br>we are standing on here for this<br>wonderful party Winona University of<br>Otago and to thank howling for her very<br>kind words and thank you also venom and<br>just to acknowledge all of my colleagues<br>and friends and family that are here<br>today this has been a very long journey<br>and yeah so I'll try and hold it<br>together basically what I'm going to do<br>is talk about my personal journey a<br>little bit of it and then get into the<br>work which is the easy stuff okay but<br>just before I start of as Ben and said I<br>work with our human skeletal remains<br>from various parts of the world and so<br>just so that you're aware I do have some<br>images of of cahuita litter of some<br>human skeletal remains not from New<br>Zealand but from from other parts of the<br>world so just so that you're aware of<br>that before I begin so where did I begin<br>born in 1969 to come to these very<br>groovy people John Buckley and Leonie<br>Arnold my mother this family unit which<br>consisted of by itself the little baby<br>there in the arms my sister Tanya and my<br>brother cow this this unit didn't stay<br>together very long when I was 3 years of<br>age we were pretty much on our own me<br>and mum and cow and then we began a<br>rather nomadic journey through through<br>life and through New Zealand and<br>everywhere in New Zealand including<br>Australia basically from the age of 3 to<br>12 years of age we moved at least once a<br>year with my stepfather Paul Mason who<br>wonderful craft<br>an artist and my mother Leonie Arnold<br>who is also an extremely talented artist<br>and her own right so basically as I said<br>it was a nomadic lifestyle and we<br>somehow they managed to find places<br>which were pretty much rent free and so<br>he we lived off their whips in there and<br>their talent<br>it was a hand-to-mouth existence it's<br>pretty much there wasn't a lot of money<br>around but there was always a lot of<br>ideas and a lot of inspiration and I<br>always remember mum and Paul and all of<br>our artist friends being very excited<br>about things a lot so so so that was<br>pretty cool<br>so anyway till I was 12 and then it was<br>just mum and I on our own on Waikiki<br>Island and but pretty much while we were<br>doing this nomadic journeying about the<br>about the country we went kept going<br>back to our Hickey to Y Hickey Island<br>and look there probably five or six<br>times during from 3 till about 12 and<br>this is not the way Hickey island that<br>you guys probably know today is the<br>resort that's full of BMWs and Range<br>Rovers this was this was a place where<br>we could basically be wild and free and<br>we were very wild and very free and I<br>was talking to my girlfriends today<br>about how how basically what we would do<br>is we would we would parents would open<br>up the doors in the morning we would be<br>lit out we would spend our time in the<br>sea and we would literally forage and<br>hunt and gather for what it was that we<br>needed to survive on and so there's my<br>gorgeous brother cow there and my<br>lifelong friends Debbie and clarity and<br>Emma who were gorgeous and still are<br>gorgeous<br>in fact of non clarity since I was three<br>and met her on why Hickey a little bit<br>about school not pretty late cluster<br>really for the first four years I<br>performed full form head my maths<br>teacher and tears in fact I just gave up<br>and we used to go into the fifth form<br>class wouldn't my fantasy novel because<br>he had no time for me so I would just<br>read do what I wanted to do with my time<br>the vice-principal<br>laughed when mum said I was going to<br>university and the science teacher mr.<br>hex used to just seen clarity out the<br>door even before we sat down he was like<br>you out so anyway I went through managed<br>to get through through school well we<br>were while I was on Waikiki my first<br>love was horses and used to spend a lot<br>of time jumping things on my horse<br>Kalani until I discovered those other<br>so yes at school that was was not not<br>great times for me but during my<br>childhood I was very fortunate to spend<br>a month and Papua New Guinea and this<br>was with my uncle Richard Richard<br>Buckley who is also a great artist<br>photographer who took this photo in the<br>middle here and this is me as a little<br>ten year old white girl up in the<br>Highlands of Papua New Guinea with the<br>Asaro Mad Men and so this this was sort<br>of the beginning of my anthropological<br>journey really through the Pacific<br>Islands that was where I sort of<br>developed a fascination for other people<br>and other ways of life and particularly<br>the Pacific so yeah so after school I<br>did one year at university and at<br>anthropology and Auckland and then I ran<br>away with a Australian chief to<br>Australia and so I worked in kitchens<br>for a couple of years washing dishes<br>doing cold louder staff loved food but<br>also discovered that I did not want to<br>do that for the rest of my life so I<br>came back to New Zealand worked for<br>another year and vineyards and why here<br>keen to get back to University so I<br>studied anthropology at University and I<br>had some fantastic teachers there Roger<br>green who's one of the gods of Lapita<br>archaeology Lisa Medicine Smith was<br>fantastic lecturer and Richard Richard<br>Walter also so it was there that I<br>really developed my love and passion for<br>Pacific prehistory and learned a lot and<br>really wanted to go down that that road<br>1997 after some more another gap year of<br>don't contract archaeology in auckland<br>Robert I I wrote to Nancy tailless who<br>was here at OU Tago because I'd heard<br>that she did vines which is what I<br>wanted to do and went to Thailand found<br>my way there to Thailand to work on an<br>archaeological site beer with her and<br>Charles home and so Nancy took me on as<br>a postgraduate student and and I which I<br>was going to do my PhD on Thai skeletal<br>material but the preservation of the<br>site that when it came up to be my turn<br>was really bad this was an Iron Age site<br>so relatively recent and prehistory and<br>then so that was in 1997 but then<br>ironically in 20 years later literally<br>I'm now working with Charles Hine back<br>in Thailand on an Iron Age site of<br>spectacular preservation and this is a<br>project that I'm working on with dr.<br>Shan Halcro and Charles home and also<br>we've got a bunch of new PhD students<br>and of course can see Stacy Ward up<br>there who's helped us a lot when they're<br>in the field on that project so far<br>so yes I'm not actually gonna talk about<br>Thailand I'm going to talk about the<br>Pacific but just before I move on I want<br>to also so I did my PhD and then worked<br>worked at sort of getting into an<br>academic role first as an assistant<br>lecturer but really at this point just<br>want to acknowledge Gareth Jones at this<br>point who had who had the foresight to<br>support to support biological<br>anthropology and could see that this was<br>something that students were interested<br>in and supported biological anthropology<br>for Nancy and I to develop this as a as<br>something that we could teach and<br>provide through Anatomy and so when I<br>first came it was it was Nancy tailless<br>was the only faculty person and now we<br>have lisa lisa meadows who smurfed<br>myself Sean Halcro Mitchell Knapp and<br>Johnnie Guilbert all faculty members and<br>numerous postgraduate students so I<br>think we're pretty pretty strong as a<br>field last but not least of course have<br>to acknowledge the sky wean and book my<br>first international conference and<br>etiquette and meet this guy via probably<br>contravenes the conflict of interest<br>policy at the University now but anyway<br>it led to lead led to this and we have<br>had a wonderful life together nearly 20<br>years and he came with those two<br>Courtney and Oliver is a complete<br>package and that's them now - beautiful<br>right work okay so what is evolutionary<br>medicine and paleo pathology this is<br>what I do basically evolutionary<br>medicine is sort of looking at at at<br>modern disease through the lens of<br>evolutionary theory so trying to<br>understand what how we are today and<br>what the evolutionary basis of there is<br>now what I have specialized in over the<br>years is sort of part of this which is<br>paleo pathology which is basically the<br>study of ancient suffering so pathos<br>suffering and paleo ancient and so<br>looking at health and disease and in the<br>past and trying to basically recreate<br>the lives of people from from different<br>sources of evidence so paleo pathology<br>and forms can inform on the past so one<br>of the sources of evidence as mummies so<br>this is probably one of the most famous<br>mummies at sea who was found in the<br>Tyrolean mountains he looked about seven<br>thousand years ago and if you're ever in<br>bulks arnaud and northern italy I highly<br>recommend visiting this museum it's been<br>fantasy he this is like an ancient cold<br>case here he was brilliant through some<br>modern imaging it was found that he was<br>actually killed shot in the back by an<br>by somebody who will never know and was<br>killed and that's why he was he was left<br>for dead out in the mountains and then<br>found also we use the sources of<br>evidence skeletons and so this is bio<br>archeology bio archeology is the study<br>of human skeletal remains from<br>archaeological sites and this is<br>essentially what what I do most mostly<br>so use the bones of these people to tell<br>their story and and put the flesh back<br>onto the bones and tell the story of<br>what their lives were so for example<br>this person here who lived 3,000 years<br>ago and Vanuatu<br>and he was buried with six other people<br>here so from our knowledge of<br>anatomy and being able to actually<br>identify these bones we know that there<br>were the skulls of three people the<br>bones of a child and that of a young<br>infant as well and you'll see this<br>person a bit more later so ancient DNA<br>there's another way of looking at paleo<br>pathology evidence of disease in the<br>past and this is something that is very<br>strong here at OU Tago and also looking<br>at ancient the the DNA of pathogens<br>which is something that we're working on<br>okay<br>a little bit of a mini teaching session<br>here just so that you can understand how<br>we can how we can actually do this so<br>the fundamental principles of what we do<br>with evolutionary medicine and paleo<br>pathology bone responds and only two<br>ways to to a pathological process and<br>that's either by producing more bone or<br>an osteoblastic response or by taking<br>bone away which is an osteoclast ik<br>response or a destructive response and<br>that could be to to to disease it could<br>be infectious disease or or trauma or<br>any other condition so for example this<br>image here we can see this is a arm bone<br>these are bones from 17th century<br>Solomon Islands and this here is all new<br>bone that's been produced by this<br>osteoblastic response and then there's<br>also these holes which have been<br>destroyed by the osteoclasts the cells<br>of the bone in this particular pattern<br>of bone production and bone removal is<br>what is specific to trip animal disease<br>or yours when yours is a non venereal<br>cousin of syphilis of venereal syphilis<br>what we do have with paleo pathology is<br>that we've got this one snapshot and<br>time that we can see<br>when the person actually died and also<br>we don't see evidence in the bones of<br>acute disease so like a cold or a flu<br>there is no time for the bone to respond<br>and so it needs to be something that has<br>actually lasted months or years for us<br>to be able to see that but what we can<br>do is that we get the advantage of<br>seeing the disease in its natural state<br>before there has been any medical and<br>intervention so we're looking at new<br>people that I had thousands of years<br>long did so hundreds of years and what<br>we're at what I'm interested in is also<br>looking at the origin of where these<br>diseases have come from how old they are<br>in that particular environment and that<br>can then help us to understand what we<br>see today and also a lot of the time<br>it's really literally just like reading<br>the bones looking at the bone and<br>surfaces to be able to see what's going<br>on doesn't necessarily just require<br>destructive analyses so as Vernon noted<br>I've worked a lot in different parts of<br>the asia-pacific region so Vietnam<br>Thailand Cambodia but what I'm actually<br>going to be doing is focusing today on<br>the work that I've done and the Pacific<br>there's a little bit of Aging in - and<br>just in Thailand Southeast Asia so an<br>opportunity to do that we need to first<br>to to be able to understand the origins<br>and antiquity of disease in this region<br>we need to look at settlement history so<br>we have two main areas and the Pacific<br>one is near Oceania it's near Oceania<br>here so it ends up basically the end of<br>the Solomon Islands and then remote<br>Oceania here now the area of remote of<br>near Oceania was settled about 50,000<br>years ago and Australia even earlier<br>than that and this was during the last<br>ice age so didn't require particularly<br>sophisticated vessels to get a Peter<br>cross and then it's not until about<br>three and a half thousand years ago that<br>we actually see people sit<br>the area past the Solomon Islands and<br>into remote Oceania and the the people<br>who actually did this were are known as<br>Lapita and we know they are visible<br>archaeologically because they made these<br>beautiful pots and they so we find<br>evidence of these pots and and the and<br>their settlements their old settlements<br>the origin of these people is thought to<br>be from Island Southeast Asia and they<br>were able to actually go out and to<br>remote Oceania because they had a new<br>type of sailing technology and they very<br>skilled at doing that the other thing<br>about this is that they these people<br>were moving through this area and this<br>was a new language group for this<br>particular area the Austronesian<br>language and Austronesian language<br>actually comes right through and to<br>Polynesia and new zealand maori is and<br>as an Austronesian language and so the<br>Lapita moved through this area and<br>colonized Western Polynesia Fiji Samoa<br>and Tonga and it's from this point that<br>I just thought that they became<br>biologically and culturally Polynesian<br>people and then went further out to to<br>eventually settle New Zealand now in one<br>of the key things when we're thinking<br>about the what the effect of the health<br>and survival of these people was<br>actually moving out into these new areas<br>is that a near Oceania there is higher<br>biodiversity so there's more wild plants<br>and animals for people to eat and there<br>is but there is also a higher disease<br>burden as well in particular malaria as<br>I'll talk about in a minute and these<br>people were vulnerable okay once you<br>actually move out into a new Virgin<br>Island environment you're actually quite<br>vulnerable to changes and the<br>environment to to enter group conflict<br>and so forth<br>but particularly also to natural<br>disasters and we saw this even last week<br>in Vanuatu where a cyclone ripped<br>through and caused<br>quite a lot in this region so what<br>actually happens when there's been a<br>cyclone come through if it's bad enough<br>is that it actually completely destroys<br>what you may actually have in the wild<br>environment to to eat so you know it<br>strips all the leaves off the trees and<br>everything so these people were quite<br>vulnerable as they were moving through<br>this area so basically what I do and<br>what I'm going to try and do is to talk<br>about the connections between diet and<br>infectious disease and talk about this<br>adaptation to the tropical and island<br>environment and this and the Pacific and<br>Southeast Asia for my PhD work I was<br>looking at infectious disease history<br>and the Pacific Islands and particularly<br>looking at the effect of malaria on the<br>health of people in the past and the my<br>fascination with malaria actually began<br>as an undergraduate when I was asked by<br>one of my lecturers to write an essay on<br>why the mosquito Victor that carries<br>malaria never actually made it past this<br>line what would be what's the the reason<br>for that because we know there is a lot<br>of malaria in this area but there's no<br>malaria and passed this line here which<br>is called the Bucks man's line and none<br>in Western Polynesia so I went off on a<br>bit of a detective trail and looked at<br>the the ecology of these mosquitoes and<br>their you know what sort of environment<br>they like to live in and so forth and<br>where we actually find them and what<br>what I found was that you have in the<br>areas where you have the highest<br>endemicity of malaria so the highest<br>disease burden it was actually where you<br>have all of these mosquito vectors<br>present but then once you actually have<br>less mosquito vectors present there is<br>lower malaria endemic and then we know<br>that they never came out<br>this line at all and the species and<br>often these forty that we that we find<br>and Vanuatu but no not past this this<br>line that's backsons line doesn't like<br>being anywhere near people<br>it doesn't like what people do to the<br>environment because we chopped down<br>forests and everything to to make<br>Gardens and so forth<br>this malaria species does not like being<br>around that kind of activity and also<br>they don't breed an artificial<br>containers so as the Lupita we're<br>actually moving through this area and<br>their canoes the double-hulled canoes<br>they were providing an environment that<br>that particular species didn't want to<br>be in so this is no this was what I came<br>up with them no one else has come up<br>with a better idea so we'll see anyway<br>so then what I found and for my PhD was<br>I was looking at infectious disease and<br>other diseases like Manny Mir and so<br>forth and having a look at where<br>basically found that there was a higher<br>disease food and fronting the skeletons<br>where there was malaria where there was<br>malaria in this area but not in the<br>sample that I was looking at from Tonga<br>there was there were diseases but it was<br>a lower disease burden unmet in that<br>area and just to note here this is<br>another example here of yours which is<br>assumed to have been present right from<br>the earliest human colonization in this<br>area and I'll touch on that point in a<br>minute now when I was doing my PhD I was<br>working on museum collections that had<br>been excavated many years before and<br>were from the last few hundred years of<br>of pre European history and the Pacific<br>Islands and the Lapita were very elusive<br>in terms of their skeletal remains there<br>were very few of them there were 15 to<br>20 skeletons many of which have since<br>been disestablished by new dating<br>programs and there was no actual<br>symmetry of Lapita except these bottom<br>people from the Bismarck Archipelago and<br>in Papua New Guinea and so there was<br>only eight people from from that<br>particular symmetry and most of the<br>research actually focused on looking at<br>the origins who these people were and<br>who they were relation to and so forth<br>there's only very anecdotal evidence of<br>health very few very few data on on diet<br>and health and what these people were<br>eating and how they were adapted to<br>their environment so basically what we<br>needed was a really big skeletal example<br>of and really well-preserved skeletal<br>sample from a Lapita site where no one<br>could question the provenance of it<br>because the bottom one people thought<br>about that for decades as to whether it<br>was actually Lapita or not and then in<br>2004 the site of tumour which is the<br>Lapita Cemetery site was found it was<br>actually found late in 2003 when<br>bulldozers were actually destroying the<br>site and luckily the local people that<br>were working there recognized that this<br>pottery was Lapita and that's because of<br>the training program that had actually<br>been done by colleagues Stuart Bedford<br>and Matthew Springs so they could<br>actually identify this this pottery and<br>called Stuart and said hey I think<br>there's something but exciting here and<br>so then they set up a field program to<br>go there<br>Stuart Bedford said to me just on the<br>off-chance he said oh I think you know<br>they said that there was some skull so<br>why don't you just come along and see<br>what happens and so by the time I<br>arrived they had actually started<br>excavating the skeletal remains of<br>people from from thus the site and it<br>was clear that it was a cemetery of<br>Lapita<br>people and nobody could question it<br>because some of them were actually<br>buried in the pita pots and in the case<br>of this woman here<br>that there was actually another pot put<br>on top of your head as well so nobody<br>could actually Christian that and I'll<br>talk more about that site in a minute so<br>one of the major themes of my research<br>over the last ten years has been trying<br>to understand health and diet basically<br>because what we eat and and how we eat<br>the food and how we distribute the food<br>can have quite significant impacts on<br>our overall quality of life and and<br>health now we sort of thinkers I think<br>of food some of us might just think of<br>food as fuel you know you've just got to<br>get it in and get moving<br>some of us like me really like to think<br>more about food and and to eat good food<br>and and so forth and food for many<br>cultures as identity so it actually<br>provides an identity to to a culture<br>like Italian cuisine or Indian cuisine<br>or so forth so it's actually becomes an<br>identity for for for identifying a group<br>so for example here these women from Oda<br>Pavillon and northern mala koola and<br>they're making letlet which is a pudding<br>which is made from starchy tubers like<br>yam or sweet potato and it's greater<br>than then put together in a pudding and<br>baked in an earth oven and the women of<br>Oda Pavan and a very proud of the alep<br>let you know this is what identifies<br>them food is also community so food<br>brings people together as we know if you<br>ever have anything going on people come<br>together and they have to eat and you<br>know and and what we like the most and<br>so here in these images this is a a<br>weeding from Eau de pavo Island or they<br>actually the mainland on mala koola and<br>these are the yams that people have<br>brought from their village these are<br>their prized games and those little tags<br>that you can see that's actually<br>identifying who they came from so this<br>sort of sets up the cycle of reciprocity<br>and obligation<br>so because it's all recorded and<br>everybody knows who brought what and and<br>so forth so it brings people together<br>food is also about power so food is also<br>about prestige and and who who gets what<br>and how food is actually divided up<br>depends on where you sit within that<br>community and so for example here this<br>is the the food that is being divided up<br>for for the feast and so there's the<br>pagan there's the yam and I just want<br>you to note that here this is the head<br>cat which is the most prestigious cut of<br>the pig so whoever is getting there is<br>considered to be a person of high status<br>now agriculture the Agricultural<br>Revolution this sort of started about<br>ten thousand years ago in different<br>areas all around the world agriculture<br>is defined as basically domestication of<br>plants and animals of different plants<br>and animals and this domestication<br>process involves modifications of those<br>species so that they will actually<br>become dependent on human management for<br>particularly with plants human<br>management for their for their survival<br>and basically as more food was produced<br>with this agricultural revolution then<br>it actually set up a cycle to allow<br>possibility for larger settlements<br>larger larger population sizes and then<br>also eventually to large cities towns<br>state-level society and so this also led<br>to social stratification in social<br>hierarchy so meaning that that some<br>people were higher than other people and<br>as Jared Diamond here has<br>well you would think this is all a good<br>thing actually what we see in bio<br>archeology from looking at skeletal<br>remains from the past is that in many<br>centers around the world there is<br>actually a decrease and health with the<br>adoption of Agriculture people actually<br>get more unhealthy what's quite<br>interesting though is from the work of<br>Nancy Taylor's and Shan Halcro my oxen<br>home working in Southeast Asia have<br>actually shown that Southeast Asia we<br>don't see this pattern that it's not<br>actually until later on and not until<br>the late iein age such as the site that<br>we're all working on now that you<br>actually see this decrease and health<br>and so something's different about about<br>how people were managing food and<br>producing food the Pacific history of<br>food production is actually quite<br>different where you get a development of<br>social inequality and social<br>stratification you also get the fact<br>that some people will be more unhealthy<br>than others and unfortunately what we<br>see today and what we also see in the<br>past is that if there is social<br>inequality it is usually the mothers and<br>the children and their babies that<br>now the oceanic food food culture as I<br>see it is quite different to anywhere<br>else in the world it is essentially<br>agricultural so there is the management<br>of domesticated plants and animals when<br>European explorers first came to<br>Polynesia they found that it was really<br>intensive agricultural production that<br>was that was going on any meal and<br>Oceania any meal that everybody sits<br>down to it's not a real meal unless<br>there is starchy root crops as part of<br>that so taro or yam or whatever<br>so the sources of protein such as the<br>pork and fish and so forth are<br>supplementary to that real Chi the real<br>part of that of this meal and also pigs<br>in particular they are not consumed<br>every day that's left for ritual<br>occasions this this whole food culture<br>in Oceania is probably from Southeast<br>Asia came from Southeast Asia we're in<br>Southeast Asia at that's rice based no<br>meal is a full meal unless there is rice<br>involved in it and there is a hierarchy<br>of food of who gets what and how food is<br>distributed and this can be based on age<br>and sex and we particularly see this<br>amongst Austronesian speakers and the<br>Pacific Islands now the Lupita what<br>would the Lapita eating who what was the<br>space of of their diet so early on it<br>was thought that they were oceanic<br>strand loopers that they had sort of<br>gone through this region and we're like<br>wild foraging on wild resources<br>particularly the the aquatic marine<br>resources and that they were nomadic and<br>then later on people started thinking no<br>actually what what they must have been<br>doing was actually carrying with them a<br>transported landscape of domesticated<br>plants and animals so what that means is<br>that they actually brought with them<br>their plants and animals that were<br>managed and so they'd sort of moved<br>through to these areas and then become<br>sedentary and set up their gardens set<br>up their manage their pegs and so forth<br>and and then move on from there<br>and this also includes the marine<br>resource of fish and so forth okay<br>so but what so what is the direct<br>okay so when when I started working on<br>the Lapita people this was sort of the<br>basic assumption of what what was sort<br>of going on and Lupita's subsistence and<br>this was based on archaeological<br>evidence and linguistic evidence and but<br>with the discovery of tumor we actually<br>we're in a position to be able to start<br>really getting at this atlas question<br>and so we have done that with looking at<br>chemical analyses of diets so looking at<br>stable isotopes of diets or looking at<br>the different proportions of murine of<br>fish fishes from the deep sea and from<br>from the reef and also the terrestrial<br>sources there so basically you don't<br>need to really worry too much about this<br>graph except that these here are higher<br>in nitrogen and and these are lower and<br>nitrogen and carbon there so this is the<br>most terrestrial on the graph and this<br>is the most marine on the graph there<br>another way of looking at diet is to<br>look at what's actually trapped inside<br>your dental plaque so the work of Monica<br>Trump dr. Monica Trump who's now Max<br>Planck Institute has been to look at<br>micro fossils that are trapped inside<br>the dental plaque including starch<br>grains and so forth and this is actually<br>a skull from tumor there and she's now<br>working on looking at proteins<br>proteomics and fancy DNA stuff and the<br>dental plaque as well another thing that<br>we've also done is looked at strontium<br>isotopes as a way of looking at<br>migration and interaction amongst these<br>people during the Lapita Lapita period<br>and why would we be interested in this<br>basically because it gives us<br>information on the amount of movement of<br>people and we know today that migration<br>and immigration of people this can be<br>extremely valuable<br>new ideas it brings new technologies it<br>brings new genes but it is also a court<br>source of conflict as well and as also<br>can be a source of new diseases and so<br>forth so we've had several sites that<br>we've been able to look at look at this<br>Christian Juana's and in Southeast day<br>Island Southeast Asia and Eastern Flores<br>where I worked with jean-christophe<br>Galipeau from France here and this Amy<br>foster and Luca Kenaston and these shown<br>who actually contracted dengue while we<br>were stuck in Bali and valiantly worked<br>and then we actually had to walk out of<br>the site because the boat was broken but<br>anyway way out in the middle of nowhere<br>here in eastern Flores and highly<br>complicated highly variable mortuary<br>practices with the removal of heads here<br>and dismembered body parts and here<br>we've got a whole person buried and a<br>pot with a kindness shell bangle what is<br>key here about this site is that it's<br>actually physically the bridge between<br>Southeast Asia and Oceania but it's also<br>culturally a bridge as well and we see<br>that in the way people are treated and<br>death and their mortuary practices and<br>then we have the site of autumn we went<br>back to excavate the site of Waterman<br>2008 in 2009 with Dimitri ensign and<br>Peter peachy and we found a few more<br>skeletons there and again thus this is<br>towards the end of the Lapita sequence<br>here and key thing here is that when<br>these were piece of people moved in to<br>this area that there were already people<br>living there before and they already had<br>their own form of plant management and<br>and food production there already and<br>there is evidence here and the others he<br>had removal there as well and the<br>earlier ones that we didn't excavate and<br>there's also sick<br>differences in how people were treated<br>and and burial and then we have this<br>fabulous boomer where there's nearly a<br>hundred under vigils that were excavated<br>from the site over several excavation<br>periods and so this is a site that was<br>directed by Stuart Bedford and Matthew<br>sprigs from Australian National<br>University was multinational and<br>multi-million a tional collaboration<br>from France New Caledonia Australia New<br>Zealand and so and and here people here<br>from ou tiger including myself<br>contributed a lot of time and a lot of<br>money to the site over the years but<br>really very interesting in terms of the<br>variation and how people were treated<br>and death so all of them had all of the<br>adults had their heads removed but the<br>female they had their heads removed but<br>the male's had their heads and the<br>clavicles removed and the sternum as<br>well which is actually part of that<br>highly prestigious cut that I mentioned<br>before<br>now he'd removal why am I going on about<br>head removal the head is the most sacred<br>part of the body and Maori tradition the<br>head is the most hapu the most sacred<br>part of the body and this reverence of<br>skulls and and ancestor worship is<br>so to summarise about thirteen years of<br>work and in a couple of slides coming<br>out I just want to say here that this is<br>the work of many students many<br>colleagues I've been very fortunate that<br>I have come from an anthropological<br>background I had I had these questions<br>and my head about well you know what<br>were these people eating what were they<br>doing and stuff and then had very very<br>smart students who could actually come<br>along and help answer those questions<br>from from their research so what is the<br>overall picture here<br>basically what we're seeing in pine at<br>pine haka is we're seeing a a food<br>culture here<br>we're from the stable isotopes that they<br>were eating mainly foods from the sea so<br>they weren't reliant on terrestrial<br>sources so that we're reliant on Gardens<br>there at all and we also see an amazing<br>amount of migration and to the site<br>these people were coming from all over<br>the place but for some reason were being<br>buried at pine haka at waton this is up<br>here and up here and on the map we see<br>some migration some movement here mostly<br>in women where the women are coming from<br>different places maybe as wives being<br>brought to the Islanders lives and we<br>see a lot of reliance on garden foods<br>and a little bit of the marine foods<br>where is that tumor somewhat<br>surprisingly given the assumption that<br>these Lapita people were moving into new<br>areas establishing their gardens and<br>seedling and they were these<br>agriculturalists with transported<br>landscapes we actually didn't find that<br>and stable isotope evidence at all we<br>found that they were mostly living from<br>wild foods and and marine based foods<br>some some terrestrial foods some garden<br>foods but the work of Monica trunk that<br>could actually directly identify the<br>plants that they were growing there are<br>actually growing foods that were sort of<br>weedy you know like taro species that<br>could actually just be planted out in<br>the swamp and left to itself the<br>high-yield easily managed type plants<br>and that had considered now to be like<br>feminine food people don't really worry<br>about those species now and there was<br>also migration as well these people were<br>brought and there were people moving<br>into this area this is a site that I<br>didn't introduce but this is all bands<br>from the Lapita period through to the<br>historic period it's from the Peter and<br>it's up and northern molecular the<br>samples are a bit fractured here so we<br>can't get a very good pattern but what<br>we do see is that there is this move<br>over time from from a wood from a tumor<br>like pattern to a more established<br>garden type pattern later so what we're<br>seeing here is that this transported<br>landscape idea is not important to the<br>initial colonizers of of tumor that they<br>were actually living more of a lifestyle<br>like these people from pine haka in in<br>terms of health we looked at the<br>differences between the nitrogen values<br>between males and females and what the<br>nitrogen values tell you was whether the<br>who was getting more protein and so<br>forth and protein is important because<br>this is what gives you your iron sources<br>you don't have enough iron then you also<br>can't absorb other nutrients like<br>vitamin C and so forth at Pine Jaco we<br>see that there was a lot more protein<br>being given to the males and at tomb of<br>the same sort of pattern a lot more<br>protein going to the males whereas at<br>Wasserman was more variable but remember<br>they're sort of in this different kind<br>of environment so in terms of the health<br>the where they actually are in terms of<br>time and also area through and between<br>near and remote Oceania determined on on<br>what sorts of foods though eating and<br>how that affected their health and at<br>tumor we see high levels of nutritional<br>deficiency particularly scurvy that<br>particularly affected the babies and the<br>mothers so we're seeing evidence of<br>maternal stress which affected the<br>survival of these people so these people<br>were vulnerable in this area and just<br>going back to yours and all of these<br>early samples there's no skeletal<br>evidence of yours<br>and these early samples so that again<br>another assumption when I started out<br>doing my PhD we haven't found the<br>evidence of this so they've actually<br>that this disease has come<br>more recently probably just pre 1500 AD<br>and I've got a PhD student who's going<br>to come and help hopefully answer that<br>question later this year<br>so basically we're seeing here through<br>this work on Lapita we're seeing this<br>evolution of a Pacific food culture from<br>Lapita or even potentially earlier from<br>this Austronesian expansion through<br>Ireland Southeast Asia where we see this<br>pattern that pine haka which is actually<br>fits within what we know about a culture<br>of people who live today an island<br>Southeast Asia who the sea nomads of the<br>bar Jew who lived off the sea and on the<br>sea and these stilt houses and they get<br>all of their there they get most of<br>their food from the sea and what they<br>need for carbohydrates and so forth they<br>trade with land-based people so what I<br>think I can say what I think right now<br>is that that but we weren't necessarily<br>Peter these early colonizing people<br>weren't necessarily these<br>agriculturalists that move through and<br>see Jordan became sedentary that may<br>have been more the sea Nomad type people<br>okay so now we have today a big problem<br>where we have people are getting bigger<br>and people are getting more unhealthy<br>this won't take two and people are<br>getting more healthy through through<br>basically in all industrialized<br>societies we see this as a growing<br>problem literally a growing problem<br>where people are getting fatter<br>and problems with obesity with<br>hypertension with diabetes and also with<br>hyperuricemia and gout hyperuricemia<br>means too much uric acid which can lead<br>to gout and all of this together is<br>known as a metabolic syndrome so I like<br>a perfect storm of these issues here and<br>what we actually see in in the Pacific<br>and particularly Polynesia as we see<br>very high levels of hyperuricemia<br>amongst Polynesians and amongst New<br>Zealand Maori gout is actually the<br>highest frequency in the world so where<br>did this come from when and when did it<br>actually arrive here in New Zealand and<br>what is the history of that so skeletal<br>evidence for metabolic syndrome I have<br>argued comes from the skeletal evidence<br>of gout very specific skeletal lesions<br>associated with gout seen here and also<br>a disease called diffuse idiopathic<br>skeletal hypostasis<br>or dish which does this to your vertebra<br>and this is an vertebral column here<br>where you produce two too much new bone<br>now amongst Europeans gout and and - are<br>associated with high foods high in fat<br>and and alcohol and so forth so this<br>interplay between genetic susceptibility<br>and environmental factors and in<br>Europeans it's more to do with<br>environmental factors of the diet<br>whereas and Polynesians there is<br>actually a genetic predisposition for<br>hyperuricemia and all of the other<br>things that go along with the metabolic<br>syndrome so gout indicia<br>archaeologically visible evidence of<br>metabolic syndrome and in the past now<br>here we are with initial colonizers and<br>New Zealand the wide over the two<br>pointer from the<br>so this is right up in the top of the<br>South Island near Blenheim a site that<br>was excavated in the 1950s 1960s there<br>were many burials taken from the site<br>and in 2009 in myself and Richard Walter<br>and Lisa medicine Smith we're involved<br>and the re-evaluation of these these<br>skeletons and Richard Walter was and<br>Richard Walter and Chris jáchym were<br>responsible for actually the<br>archaeological investigation for for the<br>place to put them back and so this site<br>has from the archaeological evidence has<br>actually seems to be a central place for<br>burial like what we were seeing and pine<br>haka this is where people were coming<br>and and having massive great feasts and<br>there were people buried there and in<br>this area there are two main groups of<br>people from the site the people have<br>Group one who had very rich grave Goods<br>and complete Experian and cluding hid<br>removal and then the this is the people<br>from Group one and then there were these<br>other the rest of the people were buried<br>on a wider area and with least grave<br>Goods and both dish and gout were found<br>and the group one individuals from<br>ancient DNA work that Mitchell net and<br>Lisa Medicine Smith their group have<br>done their finding a lot of variability<br>and the genetics of these people more<br>than was originally thought and this<br>work is ongoing with Catherine Collins<br>as working on this with Lisa on a<br>current marsden project but in terms of<br>this metabolic syndrome story there was<br>actually a mutation found associated<br>with insulin resistance and this guy<br>here who was from from Group one burial<br>2.1 I called him the rangatira<br>and his face was reconstructed by a<br>colleague and dr. Susan Hayes okay now<br>they were eating group two two three<br>they were eating everyone from Group one<br>was eating a diet which was pretty much<br>taken from the tropical East Polynesia<br>so they were they had a particular<br>dietary identity getting back to what I<br>was saying before whereas everyone else<br>at the site had different types of foods<br>that they were eating and from different<br>ecological areas so up here this is<br>seals sea mammals and then the MOA<br>down here and then this is the<br>freshwater resources here so what we're<br>actually seeing is that these people<br>they had they were eating foods from all<br>these different ecosystems but they were<br>all buried in this one place in the<br>group one people had come from somewhere<br>else and were still carrying in their<br>bones the the signature of this tropical<br>East Polynesian diet and then with the<br>strontium isotopes we actually were able<br>to even further cement that by showing<br>that the group one people had were a<br>particular group that were very<br>different now this metabolic syndrome<br>evidence we also see it at tuna and<br>Vanuatu so the Lapita people moving<br>through we see evidence of gout and -<br>and their bones and from the stable<br>isotopes we know that there was actually<br>no difference in the diet between those<br>that had the that had the skeletal<br>evidence of disease there was they<br>weren't eating different things so it<br>must have been genetically regulated in<br>some way and so at the wider bar we have<br>this this we have this ancient DNA<br>evidence of insulin resistance and<br>evidence of dish and gout there as well<br>we don't see so much and mainly in<br>Southeast Asia but I have another<br>student who's actually going to go on<br>that trail for me and mainland Southeast<br>Asian looking at gout there so basically<br>what we see is this hyperuricemia<br>trail of gout and metabolic syndrome<br>from Taiwan from Allen Southeast Asia<br>right through here to New Zealand to the<br>finally just work that I've just started<br>with Peter Pesci as an the just south of<br>here and Milton on the early European<br>colonists so this is a site where we<br>actually have been able to positively<br>identify some of the people that are<br>buried there and we have a big program<br>again with Lisa<br>Madison Athan the on the DNA and Michel<br>Knapp and work on the isotopes to<br>characterize the health of these people<br>and and to tell their stories okay and<br>also I just want to acknowledge the my<br>colleagues my Erie colleagues who have<br>allowed me to help them with the<br>identification of their ancestors and<br>and the cuy ratata for for helping with<br>the identification telling their stories<br>and to also be involved in the reburial<br>of these people as well so here is the<br>wydo bar which is most famous and here<br>pocket rocky just north of here carrot<br>on e and then and a quieter ceremony<br>here on stewart island and then most<br>recently in the Hawke's Bay and just<br>want to dedicate all of this to<br>colleagues who are no longer here and<br>thank you very much for you<br>yeah so thank you very much Hallie that<br>was a wonderful tour de force and and<br>Hiroto my name is Neil game I'm the head<br>of anatomy and it's my great privilege<br>to do a sort of a wrap-up of what<br>Haley's just told us about over the last<br>50 minutes or so it's a tough act to<br>follow and I did have some notes just<br>left them there and I'm now going to<br>wing it because basically Hallie and<br>Vernon and Harlan have pretty much said<br>most of the things I want to say so I<br>just want to reconnect with the story<br>that Ali's told us here and just to to<br>try and do some homage to that so it<br>started out with a really personal<br>exposition of Hallie so she took us down<br>to her bones and explained where she's<br>come from and then with the bones of<br>these Kohi we tangata she has told us of<br>a story of their lives<br>how they lived how they interacted with<br>each other the lives that they that they<br>endured in some cases and that has<br>connected us with him and she has<br>continually and she started finishes<br>with the the coheeries story but I<br>actually want to I want to emphasize<br>that that what I see in Hallie and<br>indeed all her colleagues and bio<br>anthropology is is that this is always<br>this connection between what they do the<br>people that they have studied and the<br>communities that they work with and it's<br>an is fabulous and I am immensely proud<br>there's a member of the department of<br>anatomy and of the University of Otago<br>to have you all here as colleagues and<br>particularly you I'm growing as a full<br>professor at this university so<br>congratulations for that it's it's truly<br>astounding and I know that you've been<br>supported in their journey and I<br>acknowledge all their support from your<br>colleagues and from your family we I<br>could go on and I have that I won't I<br>just I just want to remind everyone of<br>what this is about<br>I'm subtle was this there's a book that<br>Hallie spent I don't know 18 months<br>working on<br>she said I'm off to study leave what are<br>you gonna do I'm gonna write a book okay<br>I good on you and that's it okay there's<br>two others like this is sixty other<br>papers the volume of material that has<br>resulted and Hallie being promoted to<br>this this position is significant the<br>teaching is significant the service is<br>significant there's a lot of hard work<br>here and I did I do have a small story<br>so Nancy Telus couldn't be here but she<br>did wanted me to say that you know as I<br>knew how he was not afraid to share an<br>opinion I said yes thank you very much<br>Nancy I know that but there are some<br>opinions worth listening to and I always<br>appreciate those thoughts she said she's<br>a per sister and she told me a story and<br>we see that I mean this work we've we've<br>we've witnessed as in remote locations I<br>mean yes okay the sun's probably shining<br>and it's you know about twenty five<br>degrees so it's nice but but it's hard<br>Yakka okay and it's and it's dawn to<br>dusk and you go hard and there are a<br>hell of a lot of hours and what we've<br>just seen and some of the early stuff<br>needs he says well you know she arrived<br>on the site and Thailand she didn't<br>actually know where to go as in this<br>remote location there had been some<br>confusion about instructions was before<br>cellphones but she got there through<br>persistence there are a number of other<br>stories about trips to conferences where<br>colleagues abandoned her elector and a<br>hotel that they didn't once stay in<br>anymore so she turns up and think she's<br>still found them but there are stories<br>like that so so good on you for<br>persisting I know there's a lot of hard<br>work there and and we greatly respect<br>and appreciate it we have a small gift I<br>think we have to and this is where I<br>need my beautiful assistants but I<br>clearly I'm doing it on my own but<br>if you would be so kind we have we have<br>some small gifts for you to remember<br>this momentous occasion and there's<br>something else there that will be highly<br>useful so congratulations<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
