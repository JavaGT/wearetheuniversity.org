to<br>cast this as a us versus them human<br>Against the Machine sort of drama or<br>dilemma I actually see that we need to<br>work more closely with machines in our<br>future rather than seeing machines as<br>our opponent what we ought to think<br>about again is what machines do well<br>which they do a lot of things much<br>better than we do but also bear in mind<br>what do we as humans do better than<br>machines and if we concentrate on that<br>it becomes a different story for us to<br>humans are very good at some things and<br>we often think of our big relatively big<br>brain developing for cognitive tasks and<br>cognitive complex tasks and<br>thermodynamics etc but it turns out<br>other neuroscientists believe that our<br>big brain was developed for complex<br>tasks that were social in nature who<br>owns a tribe who read where the resource<br>is how do we create in a tribal peace<br>these are very complex problems that<br>required a big brain and our human<br>development shows that we're able to do<br>this the question is can we keep those<br>human skills of collaboration asking<br>questions curiosity empathy can we keep<br>those alive in an age where machines are<br>much more pervasive humans have always<br>used tools and so to some extent we<br>might argue that the current batch of<br>technologies are just an extension of<br>that but there are some unique dangers<br>so for example if we look at things like<br>social media nor the amount of screen<br>time that we use etc that's taking us<br>into a realm where we as humans are<br>sacrificing some of our unique<br>characteristics for example we know that<br>social media like the platforms that we<br>all participate in are actually not good<br>for social empathy we provide great<br>information about ourselves but we're<br>not necessarily connecting with others<br>in a meaningful way not really<br>understanding or wanting to know what<br>others have done when we're taking<br>pictures of our meals or our kids or<br>whatever so to some extent that might<br>seem trivial but it means that in a<br>day-to-day sense the media are weaning<br>us away from the things that we as<br>humans again do well collaboration<br>if it were straight-out competition<br>where machines took our jobs then that<br>would be one thing but in actual fact we<br>know that we will be working with<br>machines very few jobs can be fully<br>automated so only a very small<br>percentage so most of us are going to be<br>working with machines and here's another<br>risk we don't want machines to dumb us<br>down so their interfaces the things they<br>require of us the way they capture our<br>attention if that makes us worse as<br>human beings that's another problem in<br>the first Industrial Revolution humans<br>basically had to fit around the machines<br>the machines were installed and people<br>worked around them literally and over<br>the years that's become more<br>economically sensible safer indeed etc<br>but now in this era we should be able to<br>work with machines in an entirely<br>different framework I mean people need<br>to be smart and fussy consumers of<br>Technology especially at work so for<br>example if an interface doesn't work<br>well we need to push back and demand<br>that it works well for the purpose we're<br>doing with it and again keeping the part<br>of our work that's human very much<br>preserved and sacred not moving around<br>the machinery and in this case by<br>machinery I mean software I mean<br>interfaces the the visual screen<br>applications that we might be working<br>with we again need to see this as a<br>collaborative effort with machines or<br>coevolution if you will between our<br>abilities and our intent and what the<br>machines can do constantly insisting<br>that they become more natural more<br>supportive and more effective alongside<br>us<br>I believe personally that technology can<br>actually make us better humans in part<br>because it gives us something to compare<br>ourselves to and to remind us what it is<br>to be human although again I think that<br>gets blurred in our fast-paced day to<br>day life but if we start thinking about<br>what it means to be truly human we can<br>work and develop that I mean I've spent<br>40 years trying to develop human beings<br>with and without technology it's not an<br>easy process but it's really a process<br>that's worth the time and effort garry<br>kasparov who famously was beaten by<br>IBM's Big Blue at chess he's a chess<br>master he in reflecting on that episode<br>of his life he had this great optimism<br>me and that you know machines are going<br>to do what they do well in his case beat<br>him at chess but we as humans still have<br>great characteristics and he says you<br>know machines have processes and humans<br>have passion machines can do analytics<br>and answer questions but it's the humans</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
