Richard Blakey talca when you<br>were jicama he iota for a while ago or<br>taco tena koe tu<br>Tina koto T no koto katoa Acura and<br>welcome everyone my name is Richard<br>Blakey I am the deputy vice-chancellor<br>research and Enterprise it's my great<br>pleasure and privilege to welcome you<br>here tonight to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture for professor<br>Janine Haywood welcome I believe to you<br>worship the mayor who may be joining us<br>tonight<br>members of the Dunedin community<br>colleagues from the University of Otago<br>and in particular to friends and fun out<br>of Jeanine your mother Jane is here from<br>Christchurch your aunt and uncle Mary<br>and Morris Brown from Wellington husband<br>Paul and in particular your sons Jamie<br>and Charlie welcome welcome welcome to<br>you all<br>the order of ceremonies is that I will<br>be making a few words of of welcome on<br>behalf of the University and then hand<br>over to the pro vice-chancellor in the<br>division of humanities to introduce the<br>speaker for you then we'll have the IPL<br>some remarks at the end and there will<br>be an invitation to retire to the staff<br>club for refreshments afterwards now to<br>put this in context in IPL an inaugural<br>professorial lecture is a celebration of<br>all that it means to become a professor<br>here at the University of Otago with a<br>by appointment or by promotion from our<br>own ranks from our founding for<br>professors Scott Shane black and sail we<br>have very very high standards for our<br>professors to show sustained outstanding<br>leadership and competence in at least<br>two of our core activities of teaching<br>research and service and aamir sustained<br>excellence in the third so one cannot<br>compromise excellence in any of these<br>three pillars of our professional<br>practice in order to gain this highest<br>of our academic statuses in the<br>University and when these standards are<br>met it's worthwhile putting on the Ritz<br>putting on our gowns getting our regalia<br>out quartet calling our<br>together I should say welcome to the<br>vice-chancellor as well who is here with<br>us tonight in celebrating we're here as<br>a celebration not only to to hear the<br>scholarship and the research that has<br>led to this promotion but together here<br>together in celebration of what it means<br>to be a professor here at the University<br>of Otago and that's why we also put on<br>just a light function afterwards at the<br>staff club there's also a selfish<br>exercise though for those of us in<br>senior academic leadership roles because<br>it does give us a chance to switch off<br>their cellphones and those of you who<br>may have your switched on I'd advise you<br>to do the same forget about everything<br>else for an hour at the end of a working<br>day and to bask in the in the work and<br>the achievements of some of our finest<br>minds or one of our finest minds it's an<br>academic spar time for us if you like so<br>my duty here tonight is on the behalf of<br>the vice-chancellor to set the scene and<br>in hand over to Tony and to introduce<br>just in a general sense the kinds of<br>things that have led to professor<br>Hayward's promotion as I've indicated<br>already we set very high standard<br>standards for determining whether or not<br>one of our own academic staff members<br>can join a professorial and in this<br>process we not only rely on an internal<br>staff and committee a promotions<br>committee but we seek the views of many<br>others including the views of leading<br>international experts professor Hayward<br>whose expertise in the rich tapestry of<br>New Zealand politics especially tutor<br>ETO to Waitangi that we'll be hearing<br>about tonight has not only contributed<br>as we found out through our referees to<br>the to the national conversation but has<br>made a global impact with the<br>scholarship in the context that from<br>what we learn about ourselves in a<br>political history can also inform others<br>about their place in the world - an<br>example from one of Janine's<br>international referees highlights this<br>in stating not about the treaty I'll get<br>to that in a moment but that papers from<br>Janine analyzing citizen assemblies and<br>juxtaposing them as<br>actual models for New Zealand practice<br>have open new perspectives on their<br>strengths and weaknesses in a way that<br>studies of how they have worked in other<br>jurisdictions have not in other words<br>what we have learned about ourselves has<br>informed others about their place in the<br>world and also from international<br>referees Janine's contributions to New<br>Zealand through who work on to 3t are in<br>many ways the shining lights that we're<br>going to hear about tonight we're both<br>New Zealand and international referees<br>recognize that quote who publications<br>are the most recognized<br>whoo-hooo publications that are most<br>recognized and cited are those on<br>authority and the politics of the<br>Constitution's Constitution and that she<br>is widely recognized as one of the<br>world's leading authorities on our<br>democratic and constitutional practice<br>so I think that you will agree with me<br>that those kind of comments<br>independently obtained from<br>international experts are worthy of your<br>promotion Janine and confirm the wisdom<br>of the vice-chancellor and confirming<br>your your appointment no matter what our<br>international experts in our own<br>advisory committees give us advice it is<br>a promotion that the vice-chancellor and<br>endorses so with that I will now invite<br>professor Tony Ballentine to give a<br>little bit more detail of your<br>background and introduce you as a<br>so tena koutou katoa is my great<br>pleasure to introduce professor Janine<br>Haywood who is of course the professor<br>of politics and the current head of the<br>department of politics here at the<br>University Janine was born and raised in<br>Christchurch I was talking as her today<br>and I was going to ask her what school<br>she went to<br>which is a very crisis question but I<br>scooted around that<br>her undergraduate studies were<br>undertaken at the University of<br>Canterbury and she completed her PhD at<br>Victoria University she came to Otago in<br>1998 after working at the Waitangi<br>tribunal and here at the University she<br>researches and teaches very widely with<br>expertise in New Zealand politics<br>environmental and treaty politics of<br>literal studies local government and<br>resource management but she also has<br>significant ties to Canada both the<br>Simon Fraser University and the<br>University of British Columbia in<br>Vancouver<br>now those Canadian connections underpin<br>the teaching she's undertaken on<br>comparative Canadian politics as well as<br>her research relating to indigenous and<br>state relations a literal reform and<br>citizens assemblies in Canada now today<br>when I was chatting to Janine I asked<br>her how she got interested in politics<br>she suggested a impart the answer lies<br>with her upbringing<br>her parents were interested in education<br>and in the environment and there were<br>lots of conversations about justice in<br>the house now they're concerned with<br>justice has threaded through her New<br>Zealand focused research she has<br>produced an arc of influential edited<br>collections chapters and journal<br>articles exploring New Zealand politics<br>the relationship between Milly Erne<br>politics and particular local government<br>and the significance of the treaty and<br>also the Waitangi tribunal and the<br>treaty settlement processes for Jeanine<br>research is not just some abstract<br>intellectual activity confined to her<br>office into the library but rather she<br>has been very committed to using her<br>knowledge of local politics and the<br>electoral system to enhance our<br>democracy she has worked with local<br>government in Dunedin and elsewhere on<br>electoral systems<br>and in 2015 chaired the DCCC<br>representation review and this year<br>Janine worked with the University and<br>the Electoral Commission on a<br>comprehensive campus campaign to boost<br>student voter turnouts now I think one<br>other thing that's very important to say<br>about Janine is that she's a truly great<br>college she is thoughtful she is<br>generous and she has an excellent<br>institutional citizen she works very<br>well with others sorry that does sound<br>like a primary school report doesn't but<br>but but it's true<br>Janine and I think it's very important<br>to note of a really exceptional record<br>of research collaboration and I think it<br>would be very nice just to note two of<br>those collaborations in particular one<br>is with her colleague and politics Chris<br>Rudd which has seen them correlate to<br>volumes of essays and sheer teaching in<br>supervision and the others with Nicola<br>wing and law which again has seen them<br>career that two volumes one on the<br>Waitangi tribunal and one on treaty<br>settlements published both both<br>published by Bridget Williams box the<br>Treaty of course is the focus of<br>Janine's<br>literature tonight and I'm delighted to<br>handover hip to her so could you please<br>Oh tena koutou katoa king um might say<br>what's a white walnut Oh hide out suitor<br>it's a hunger order I mean he knew he<br>care coat okay talk but on your theater<br>Mart he me he tiene ki tamanna

hawky<br>tiene Coto<br>tena koe t no koto Carter thank you so<br>much for that very generous introduction<br>I've been asked to speak to you today<br>about my research journey but from my<br>perspective standing here I can actually<br>see quite a lot of that journey<br>myself and the faces of lots of the<br>people gathered here and I would like to<br>thank you all very much for coming along<br>to colleagues to community members to<br>students that I can see and certainly<br>friends thank you so much for your<br>presence here I'd particularly like to<br>acknowledge my family from out of town<br>my mum and my husband Paul and also our<br>two boys who have come along to support<br>me despite suspecting that I'm going to<br>be really boring City through Waitangi<br>the Treaty of Waitangi has set at the<br>centre of my passion for New Zealand<br>politics since my undergraduate days at<br>the University of Otago my PhD at<br>Victoria University in the mid-1990s was<br>a wonderful excuse to learn everything I<br>could about New Zealand politics and how<br>it's been shaped by and at the same time<br>marginalized the agreement made in 1840<br>my supervisor was Professor Elizabeth<br>McClay and while at the time I valued<br>her academic guidance in hindsight I've<br>also come to appreciate her influence as<br>a role model for me as a woman in the<br>field of political science after my PhD<br>I worked for two years at the Waitangi<br>tribunal with historian Alan<br>ward on an overview of treaty breaches<br>across our Teodoro in New Zealand the<br>purpose of the project was to allow the<br>waiting a tribunal to anticipate the<br>work that it had ahead of it and to send<br>a message to government that the task of<br>redressing treaty grievances would<br>likely be much larger than it was<br>originally anticipated the national<br>overview project Donahoe afar nui gave<br>me an appreciation of the vast and at<br>the same time intensely personal<br>grievances Maori carry in all regions as<br>a result of our colonial history when I<br>came to the department of politics at<br>Otago in 1998 I was determined to bring<br>the treaty and my experiences at the<br>Waitangi tribunal into my teaching and<br>into my research and more importantly<br>into political science a discipline<br>where it had long been neglected my<br>target audience was the predominantly<br>party our students studying politics at<br>Otago my early experiences of talking<br>with those students about the treaty<br>were on reflection now rather shaky I<br>vividly recall one particular occasion<br>and my very my first few years of<br>teaching when around ten students made a<br>point of very noisily getting up and<br>leaving the lecture theatre as I talked<br>about the treaty in our colonial history<br>they weren't expecting New Zealand<br>politics to include discussion of the<br>treaty and they made it clear through<br>walking out and through their subsequent<br>charming comments on course evaluations<br>that they objected strongly to having to<br>listen to it I found it disturbing to<br>encounter such bold resistance from<br>young minds that should be open to<br>learning I'm forever grateful to the<br>support of my colleagues in the politics<br>department and at Susumu which became my<br>second home as I found my feet and<br>stayed the course things have changed a<br>lot since those days when I talk about<br>the treaty today students don't leave<br>the class and protest I now teach at<br>paper specifically about treaty politics<br>to a larger group of students some of<br>whom I can see here<br>who are extremely ideologically<br>ideologically diverse and diverse in<br>many ways they generally agree on the<br>significance of the treaty to<br>contemporary politics even if they don't<br>agree on the appropriate ways to address<br>the treaty challenges we face as a<br>nation many of my other research<br>interests are somehow related to the<br>treaty I've written about local<br>government and environmental management<br>largely because it's impossible to talk<br>about these things without talking about<br>treaty obligations<br>I'm deeply interested in electoral<br>systems again largely because these are<br>important tools in achieving<br>representation that reflects the treaty<br>relationship<br>I've spent a considerable amount of time<br>in Canada as was mentioned earlier with<br>the family happily in tow learning about<br>the experiences of First Nations on the<br>west coast of Canada in particular I've<br>learned more about New Zealand by<br>leaving its shores and seeing it from a<br>distance through the eyes of other<br>people than I ever would have learned by<br>staying at home so given the opportunity<br>to talk to you all naturally I felt<br>inclined to talk about the treaty but<br>rather than talk about the research I<br>have done I wanted to talk about one<br>idea that has consistently guided my<br>approach to that research and which<br>still gives me optimism today that idea<br>is that our political future is in many<br>ways in many ways determined by the<br>capacity and limits of our political<br>imagination when I was writing my PhD I<br>had the final two lines from an Ellen<br>Curnow poem that I'd studied a New<br>Zealand literature my second love stuck<br>to the side of my Mac is a computer<br>screen it was a source of inspiration to<br>me and it remains so today these lines<br>come from his poem the skeleton of the<br>great moor and the canterbury museum<br>christchurch and they read not i some<br>child born in a marvelous year will<br>learn the trick of standing upright here<br>something about those words captured my<br>imagination then and continue to<br>intrigue me today<br>my research journey with the treaty of<br>waitangi could be described as an<br>endless quest to understand what the<br>treaty can tell us about the trick of<br>standing up right here for those of you<br>unfamiliar with the treaty I'll give you<br>a few essential facts and related<br>thoughts a quick treaty 101 and my<br>apologies for those of you whom this is<br>very familiar<br>it'll be familiar to my students the<br>treaty was signed at Waitangi on<br>February 6 1840 by Maori rangatira and a<br>representative of the British sovereign<br>it has three short articles written them<br>both today are Maori and in English if<br>people know anything about the treaty<br>they usually know that the English<br>version the treaty is different in very<br>significant ways from the version into<br>today omadi<br>to Tahiti the first two articles are<br>most significant to my discussion so<br>I'll just briefly describe them article<br>1 of Tate's Aditi the Maori version of<br>the treaty says in translation that the<br>Chiefs give up to the Queen of England<br>forever the government kawana Tonga of<br>their lands in the English version the<br>treaty declares the Chiefs cede to Her<br>Majesty the Queen of England absolutely<br>all the rights and powers of sovereignty<br>which the Chiefs exercised or possess in<br>article 2 of TTT again and translation<br>the Queen of England arranges and agrees<br>to the full chieftainship of the Chiefs<br>Tino rangatiratanga over their lands<br>settlements and all their treasures well<br>in English the treaty promises that Her<br>Majesty confirms and guarantees to the<br>Chiefs and tribes the full exclusive and<br>undisturbed position of their lands and<br>forests as long as they wish and desire<br>to retain the same in their possession I<br>could talk for a very long time about<br>the circumstances surrounding the treaty<br>and the meaning of those words but I<br>won't instead I want to draw your<br>attention to the two very different<br>visions of future New Zealand presented<br>by TT DT and<br>the Treaty in 1840 visions held by Marty<br>rangatira on the one hand and the<br>British on the other through Tate's<br>Aditi Marty rangatira understood that<br>they would continue to exercise absolute<br>authority uniting at Arizona over their<br>lands and their peoples and indeed that<br>the crown would protect their right to<br>do so through the treaty on the other<br>hand the crown assumed not only the<br>right to govern but the right to<br>exercise absolute or thorat sovereignty<br>Dakota fascinating complex and long<br>story unsatisfactorily short the<br>coexistence of marty tino rangatiratanga<br>and Crown sovereignty created tension<br>after 1840 the crown overcame this<br>tension by using its legislative and<br>political authority to undermine and<br>marginalize the rights tat Aditi had<br>guaranteed to Maori these treaty<br>breaches have been acknowledged by our<br>governments the crown has apologized for<br>its actions and inactions which breached<br>the treaty and grievances are being<br>addressed and redressed through treaty<br>settlements but other aspects of the<br>treaty relationship remain unresolved<br>one fundamental and ongoing challenge of<br>particular interest to me is the<br>relationship being between TTT and the<br>Constitution itself as a nation we don't<br>talk much about our Constitution in fact<br>many people think New Zealand doesn't<br>have a constitution or at least not a<br>proper one this is not true a<br>constitution is simply the rules and<br>norms relating to the exercise and<br>limits of power in a society and New<br>Zealand has all the rules and norms it<br>needs to function as a nation even if it<br>sometimes doesn't feel like it it has a<br>constitution but unlike countries such<br>as the USA our Constitution is not<br>written down in one place it's spread<br>throughout acts of parliament<br>regulations and even exists in unwritten<br>political conventions in this regard we<br>are fairly unique so for example the<br>Constitution Act talks about<br>sovereign Parliament legislature and<br>courts the Bill of Rights sets out our<br>rights and freedoms the Electoral Act<br>provides the rules of elections and the<br>Cabinet Office manual which isn't law at<br>all talks about the caretaker government<br>and government formation amongst other<br>things and so on and so on when we talk<br>about New Zealand's Constitution we're<br>simply talking about all of these rules<br>and many others that relate to the<br>exercise of political power and the<br>limits to that power<br>so what relationship does tensity to<br>your weight song you have with the<br>Constitution and more importantly what<br>relationship should it have this is a<br>matter of debate<br>many people our governments included<br>talk about the treaty as a founding<br>document in New Zealand but others deny<br>that it has any place in our<br>contemporary politics at all the treaty<br>itself is not law but whenever the<br>Constitution is discussed the treaty and<br>its relevance to political power and the<br>limits to that power becomes a central<br>point of debate I've watched this debate<br>unfold for the last 20 years and in many<br>ways it has made remarkably little<br>progress I'm fascinated by the question<br>of how we might reconcile very different<br>visions of our constitutional future in<br>relation to the treaty so for the time<br>remaining I want to talk about two<br>particular constitutional futures that<br>have been recently proposed and think<br>about how we might bring those composite<br>conversations together and a common<br>vision but first a few thoughts about<br>the ideas that shape the way we think<br>about our Constitution today in 1996<br>legal history scholar Paul McHugh wrote<br>a paper called constitutional voices<br>which has greatly influenced my thinking<br>about our Constitution McHugh suggested<br>that the language we use to talk about<br>our Constitution both reflects our<br>current culture and affects the<br>character of our future thoughts and<br>actions this is a simple and persuasive<br>idea referred to sometimes today is<br>setting the<br>narrative the language we use determines<br>the conversations we can have if we<br>don't share the language required to<br>conceive of and communicate ideas it<br>makes it much less likely that<br>alternatives unfamiliar to us can be<br>considered and given life it makes it<br>harder for us to talk to each other<br>and be understood McHugh wrote this<br>article at a pivotal time in New<br>Zealand's treaty history<br>soon after the courts had made their<br>first landmark judgments about the<br>treaty in the late 1980s but before the<br>first of the major treaty settlements<br>had been achieved in the late 1990s his<br>point overall was to say that most New<br>Zealanders were simply unaware that<br>Maori conceived of a political future<br>that fundamentally challenges the notion<br>of Crown sovereignty McCue argued that<br>New Zealanders instead are read to think<br>in terms of a singular and absolute<br>crown in Parliament and to assume that<br>we have cultural uniformity and an<br>undifferentiated population and this<br>powerful narrative he explained the<br>Crown's sovereignty is indivisible and<br>absolute and deemed always to have been<br>present and most certainly beyond refute<br>our colonial history tells a tale of New<br>Zealand's development from a fledgling<br>colony to an adolescent Dominion<br>maturing into full independent statehood<br>as many other scholars have also<br>acknowledged the language used to talk<br>about our Westminster tradition draws<br>heavily on the concepts of pragmatism<br>and egalitarianism as significant<br>cultural values and depending New<br>Zealand's Constitution and political<br>tradition when I teach New Zealand<br>politics I use this narrative myself it<br>is a simple explanation which McHugh<br>describes as having reassuring fireside<br>tone he says thats thrall is so complete<br>that it is impossible to conceive of<br>national history beyond that process but<br>as McHugh notes this narrative is not<br>reassuring for everyone<br>LTO in New Zealand is<br>the nation of jewel if not multiple<br>histories often running in parallel to<br>each other the dominant merit narrative<br>which normalizes the crown at the same<br>time marginalizes mardi and denies the<br>treaty any foundational status and<br>constitutional presence as McHugh warned<br>in 1996 through this view of our history<br>and our present Maori become irrelevant<br>and the problem presented by the<br>cultural difference no more than a<br>hiccup in national growth McCue<br>anticipated that Maori treaty claims and<br>settlements that acknowledge the Crown's<br>wrongdoing and address those grievances<br>would ultimately also fundamentally<br>challenge the Crown sovereignty he said<br>that treaty claims posit the existence<br>of a legitimate source of authority<br>independent of the crown in 2015 the<br>Waitangi tribunal did as McHugh<br>predicted and concluded in regard to the<br>Northland enquiry that the rangatira who<br>signed tatse DT or Waitangi in February<br>1840 did not cede their sovereignty to<br>Britain that is they did not see to<br>authority to make and enforce law over<br>people in territories over there people<br>in territories as McHugh also predicted<br>the Waitangi tribunals findings were met<br>with fierce resistance from government<br>and the public discussion of the<br>possibility of a source of sovereignty<br>beyond the crown was dismissed as<br>fanciful and dangerously just divisive<br>and the discussion was short-lived the<br>narrative of the absolute and singular<br>crown quickly won the day but the thrall<br>of the Crown's authority is far from<br>complete today Toa legal scholar marma D<br>Stephens argues that there is a<br>long-established distinctive and<br>evolving Maori constitutional tradition<br>with values that are directly relevant<br>to the practice of New Zealand's<br>Constitution Calvin Jones and Nautica<br>Kahungunu and te aitanga a mahaki legal<br>scholar<br>similarly describes a maori<br>constitutional tradition sourced Antigua<br>or the correct way of doing things in<br>Maori society he explains that the Maori<br>constitutional tradition embodies five<br>values for known Otunga relationships<br>manake Tonga and kaitiakitanga looking<br>after people and an ethic of<br>guardianship mana or spiritually<br>sanctioned Authority and limits to that<br>authority Taku and nor the spiritual<br>character of all things and uh to<br>balance and reciprocity Jones notes<br>these key institutions embody both<br>values and practice they transmit<br>information about the correct way of<br>behaving from one generation to the next<br>and provide reasoned responses to<br>constitutional questions from how to<br>place limits on lawmaking authority to<br>how a person or body exercising public<br>power should react to a given set of<br>circumstances we have therefore in New<br>Zealand two sources of political<br>authority Maori and the crown and each<br>source is inspired by distinctive values<br>and principles which guide the<br>appropriate use of power and limits to<br>that power despite the overwhelming<br>dominance of the Crown's narrative Maori<br>constitutionalism survives into print<br>independent of the crown and recently it<br>has begun to call for recognition my<br>interest in thinking about these<br>distinctive constitutional traditions is<br>how we might bring them together and<br>whether doing so is some part of the<br>trick to standing up right here the<br>first of these constitutional futures<br>drawn from Maori constitutional<br>tradition formally emerged in 2010 led<br>by professors miner Jackson and Margaret<br>Mutu on behalf of an independent working<br>group supported by Erie and Maori<br>organisations their purpose is to<br>develop and implement a model for an<br>inclusive constitution for our Tarawa<br>based on tea kanga and Kawa and Tate's<br>Aditi or Waitangi the working group can<br>conducted an impressive 252 Hui within<br>Maori communities around the country<br>from 2012 to 2015 at all Padang guitar<br>here youth arm of the working group<br>convened a further 71 hunger workshops<br>with these with young people I saw a<br>demonstration of the danget aji<br>workshops in action some years ago and<br>was incredibly inspired by the way that<br>it brought the Constitution down to<br>earth and empowered Maori doughnuts aji<br>to talk about the political forces that<br>have shaped our past and the ideas and<br>values that matter to them and imagining<br>their political future the report that<br>was produced from these hui motsek mi<br>was released in 2016 it describes itself<br>as a part of a constitutional<br>transformation that has been taking<br>place amongst Maori for the past 170<br>years<br>the report talks about a very real<br>desire for more open constitutionalism<br>and a conciliatory and consensual<br>democracy rather than an adversarial and<br>majoritarian one it proposes five<br>alternative constitutional models which<br>each differently identify spheres of<br>influence for Maori rangatiratanga and<br>Crown government in each case a third<br>relational sphere is also imagined where<br>treaty relationships operate what these<br>models have in common is the centrality<br>of T TD T it is the framework for the<br>Constitution itself according to Matic<br>in my the agenda going forward is to<br>engage with the crown and local<br>authorities as well as their broader<br>communities in the lead-up to a Maori<br>Constitutional Convention in 2021<br>at which time Maori will call for at<br>Aditi Convention to consider<br>constitutional transformation by 2040<br>the report accepted that some people<br>would find the process divisive<br>threatening and unrealistic the authors<br>said the task ahead might be difficult<br>because the only constitutional model<br>most people know is the Westminster<br>established by the crown it seems to be<br>the only constitutional reality and it<br>Brooks no questioning of its primacy<br>except on peripheral matters and it's<br>stubborn presence it simply seems a<br>movable and unchallengeable some 20<br>years after McHugh had asked the<br>question Mataji my is also asking if we<br>have the capacity to imagine a different<br>political and constitutional future a<br>second constitutional proposal has also<br>recently emerged this time very strongly<br>influenced by our Westminster tradition<br>longtime advocate for constitutional<br>change in New Zealand Geoffrey Palmer<br>has teamed up with legal scholar Andrew<br>Butler to propose a modern constitution<br>for New Zealand which in their words is<br>easy to understand reflects New<br>Zealand's identity and nationhood<br>protects rights and liberties and<br>prevents governments from abusing power<br>this includes the place of the treaty<br>within a new constitution the pair have<br>published a book and established a<br>website to accompany the proposal and to<br>call for public submissions with regard<br>to the treaty they say the Treaty of<br>Waitangi is an integral part of New<br>Zealand's constitutional arrangements<br>the legitimacy of the system of<br>government we have in New Zealand owes<br>much to the treaty in our view the<br>treaty should be an established an<br>essential part of any written<br>constitution it is essentially New<br>Zealand's first constitutional document<br>the treaty is a key source of the New<br>Zealand government's moral and political<br>claim to legitimacy and governing the<br>country Palmer and Butler proposed<br>incorporating the treaty within the new<br>Constitution they say the change will<br>bring much-needed coherency and<br>consistency to a legally untidy<br>situation at present the Treaty of the<br>treatment of the treaty within the<br>newzik sorry<br>at present the treatment of the treaty<br>within the New Zealand system of<br>government presents as ungainly and<br>clear and untidy they acknowledge that a<br>similar attempt was<br>made in the mid-1980s by the Labour<br>government to recognize the treaty in a<br>proposed bill of rights as they note<br>Modi rejected this proposal at the time<br>raising fears that it would make the<br>treaty vulnerable to amendment by<br>government Parma and Butler proposed to<br>overcome this by preventing amendment to<br>the text of the treaty they concede<br>however that it's not clear to them<br>whether or not Modi would reject this<br>proposal again today because and I quote<br>they have not had the opportunity to<br>consult with Maori to the extent<br>necessary before proposing our draft<br>constitution the issues need to be<br>addressed systematically and we hope to<br>have the chance to engage in much wider<br>consultation through the next phase of<br>the project<br>Marzuki Mai and the Palmer and Butler<br>proposal present therefore two very<br>different constitutional visions<br>emerging from two very different<br>constitutional traditions both have been<br>conceived of and written in the language<br>familiar to their constitutional<br>tradition and both acknowledge that at<br>some future time they will talk to each<br>other about their proposals but how will<br>that happen and how should it happen<br>these two constitutional conversations<br>are being conducted largely in parallel<br>with language values and traditions that<br>almost appear to speak past each other<br>can thus be reconciled and if so how<br>as McHugh noted listening is hard to do<br>when one is used to dominating the<br>conversation real dialogue requires<br>compromise founded on a willingness to<br>listen when I think about how the crown<br>and Maori could listen and talk to each<br>other about our Constitution I find the<br>work of Canadian political theorist<br>James Tully extremely useful Tully says<br>the conversations constitutions are<br>ongoing conversations that ought to<br>overlap and be in an interaction and a<br>negotiation in a way that recognizes<br>different<br>and acknowledges interdependency Tally's<br>been a significant voice in<br>conversations about modern<br>constitution-making particularly in<br>relation to the rights of indigenous<br>peoples he talks about the politics of<br>cultural recognition and draws attention<br>to the spirit we bring to constitutional<br>reform which depends in part on the<br>language and ideas available for us to<br>discuss those issues for the most part<br>he imagines that it's possible for<br>groups of people with distinct<br>constitutional traditions to have a back<br>and forth of ideas in order to<br>understand a different perspective and<br>more importantly to find a common ground<br>Toni says this process requires parties<br>to engage in simple human interactions<br>like let me see if I understand you<br>correctly let me rephrase what you've<br>said as I understand it and see if you<br>agree no you haven't heard me correctly<br>let me try another example that might be<br>more familiar to you in other words<br>these simple human exchanges require us<br>to be willing to use our imagination<br>Talley explains that this process should<br>be guided by three important conventions<br>mutual recognition consent and cultural<br>continuity I want to end by talking<br>briefly about these ideas and what they<br>might look like in New Zealand<br>Tally's mutual recognition calls for the<br>full public acknowledgement by each<br>cultural group of the other groups of<br>citizens in a society this is essential<br>to establishing a just form of<br>constitutional discussion and which as<br>Talley explains each speaker is given<br>his or her due neutral recognition is<br>achieved when all parties engaged in the<br>constitutional discussions refer to each<br>other in the language each party users<br>to refer to itself once mutual<br>recognition is established each group<br>can then freely consent to the form of<br>constitutional Association discussed and<br>negotiated by the groups<br>the conceit obtained as a result of the<br>negotiations must enable as the third<br>convention the cultural continuity of<br>all parties the stands and stark<br>contrast to the view that a new<br>Constitution discontinues or<br>extinguishes the pre-existing culture<br>and customs of the groups engaged and<br>makes them all one people or that a<br>constitution can impose rites or declare<br>rites on behalf of other people in<br>tallies model of Constitution making<br>cultural diversity has acknowledged<br>celebrated and protected the image tally<br>uses to depict this form of Constitution<br>making is this sculpture created by<br>Haider First Nations artist bill Reid<br>standing 19 feet long and 12 feet high<br>the canoe holds 13 characters from Haida<br>Gwaii mythology as Tully explains the<br>characters face in different directions<br>they appear to be at the same time<br>attacking and supporting each other and<br>they are wholly inside or outside partly<br>outside the canoe but they are paddling<br>in unison and in the same direction the<br>central figure who holds the staff is<br>unknown to hide a mythology and could be<br>anyone in other words no one knows who's<br>really in charge Talley interprets the<br>sculpture in the context of modern<br>Constitution making and asks what kind<br>of dialogue does this artwork encourage<br>humanity to engage with vitally these<br>characters represent the three<br>conventions of mutual recognition<br>consent and cultural continuity what<br>might these look like in the New Zealand<br>context as the conventions that shape<br>our constitutional future<br>what sort of Walker would depict New<br>Zealand's constitutional journey who<br>would the characters on board be and<br>what would the relationships between<br>them look like New Zealand's Walker<br>would be distinctive to our<br>constitutional traditions and<br>relationships<br>perhaps for example the unknown central<br>character and our Walker would be a<br>woman I've had the pleasure of meeting<br>with professor Talley on more than one<br>occasion during my visits to Canada to<br>discuss his ideas with them most<br>recently I visited him at the University<br>of Victoria in British Columbia and I<br>described to him the two very different<br>constitutional visions emerging in New<br>Zealand from these different<br>constitutional traditions and I asked<br>him directly what he thought it might<br>look like if New Zealand were to<br>experience contemporary<br>constitution-making of the type that he<br>describes what would it look like if<br>Marty and the crown were guided by the<br>conventions of mutual recognition<br>consent and cultural continuity<br>professor Tully personifies the<br>qualities he seeks to inspire and others<br>it is not for him to provide answers but<br>rather did it help others develop the<br>ability to find those answers themselves<br>in other words he is that rare type of<br>person at least in my family who prefers<br>to listen and not speak in response to<br>my question he suggested that we took a<br>walk around the campus gardens they were<br>distractingly glorious we talked more<br>about flowering dogwoods and prehistoric<br>ginkgo trees than we did about<br>constitutional politics and I shared<br>with her my not-so-secret ambition to be<br>a botanical garden that when I grow up I<br>didn't find the answers I sought that<br>day and I'm still thinking and still<br>listening most often my thoughts about<br>our constitutional future lead back to<br>totality itself and specifically the<br>things that we know about the<br>negotiations and agreement that occurred<br>on the 5th and 6th of February 1840<br>despite the terrible injustice that<br>unfolded after 1840 at that moment there<br>was mutual recognition between Maori and<br>the crown that as sovereign peoples on<br>these small islands they needed to<br>negotiate a common future more most<br>importantly the British recognized Marty<br>doughnuts here that's<br>and sort martí consent for a shared<br>constitutional future a treaty was<br>proposed and presented today nazi-era<br>in today Oh Marty and was discussed with<br>the British with the aid of translators<br>there was a back and forth a simple<br>human exchange of ideas that exchange of<br>ideas led during a theatre gathered at<br>Waitangi to consent to the terms of<br>Tate's Aditi as they understood them<br>those terms guaranteed Maori cultural<br>continuity said it's your Waitangi<br>presented a simple bold exchange that<br>established a shared constitutional<br>future perhaps the constitutional<br>conversation we look for now between<br>Maori and the crown can find inspiration<br>in this experience from our past more<br>importantly we can learn from our<br>understanding and hindsight of what is<br>required to maintain promises that are<br>made in the constitutional relationships<br>that are developed in the context of<br>treaty politics today we can seem a long<br>way away from Tally's vision a<br>constitution making even the first<br>hurdle of mutual recognition evades us<br>unlike in 1840 the crown today does not<br>refer to Maori in the language that<br>Maori used to refer to themselves the<br>crown does not recognize or speak of<br>Maori during its head Otunga so where<br>does this leave us each year I teach my<br>treaty politics paper to a new group of<br>students who are growing up in a very<br>different RTO in New Zealand to the one<br>that shaped my ideas and values I'm<br>inspired not only by their fresh<br>approach to well-worn conversations<br>about the treaty but also that by their<br>capacity to open their minds to what<br>might be possible in our political<br>future where once I was possibly too<br>radical for some students I'm now in the<br>wonderful position of trying not to be<br>left behind I have learned a great deal<br>about our possible constitutional<br>futures from the discussions I've had<br>with these students I have no idea if<br>these young people were born in Ellen<br>kunos marvelous year<br>and whether they will learn the trick of<br>standing upright here but as I continue<br>my research into Intuit it's Aditi and<br>our constitutional future I certainly<br>take great heart from their willingness<br>to talk and to listen and their capacity<br>to imagine<br>noreda tena koe tena koe tu tena koe so<br>ha<br>you know cooter omelette zero definitely<br>not go to go out of my doughnut see<br>dirty no good even someone as a<br>politically as me found something to do<br>on that presentation say the F Jeannine<br>and that's treaty when I won ended for<br>this evening we expect your assignments<br>to be in the Dropbox by the end of the<br>day say she's worked on the treaty for<br>the treaty of waitangi presented our<br>conferences on the treaty been on treaty<br>research groups been in the opposite<br>part of the parliamentary commission on<br>the treaty and has been involved in a<br>number of professorial lectures and<br>conferences international and national<br>armed treaty so if in any of you are<br>preparing to engage and some fight for<br>justice Gerrard treaty wrongs and to<br>reach independent sovereignty and<br>self-governance then professor Janine<br>Haywood at your service sir from the<br>lecture she posed the question what's<br>the range of one's political imagination<br>but the recent politics here in New<br>Zealand in Winston Peters standing in<br>the middle of the walk up there maybe<br>there aren't any boundaries but the<br>treaty where's that struggled<br>historically whatever its implications<br>in this application today we were<br>constitutional transformation take New<br>Zealand to the future in what shape when<br>New Zealand's our identity and nation or<br>take and all of us here this evening<br>after hearing their lecture will play an<br>important role in debt whatever shape<br>that made in form that may take so in<br>recognition of the small thing the<br>trainer journey the university presents<br>and to take a quote from Jenny's lecture<br>listening is hard to do when one is used<br>to dominating discourse<br>Janine has listened to they allowed her<br>students to talk and she's been prepared<br>to listen so in that vein is really a<br>privilege to thank you for sending Ian<br>enhance in this evening and this<br>occasion for Jeanine said the University<br>engineering and a family and what you to<br>join the academic party ever the<br>university staff club hearty in the<br>celebration for
