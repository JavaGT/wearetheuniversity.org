Pharmacists are experts on medicines, helping people gain more benefit with less harm. <br><br>This video was put together by recent pharmacy graduates to provide people with a better idea about the increasingly diverse roles for pharmacists in New Zealand.  We would like to acknowledge the people who generously gave their time to make this video. <br><br>You can learn more about the pharmacists featured in the video on our School of Pharmacy website at: https://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/en/sop/about/pharmacy-as-a-career.html.<br><br>He Rau Aroha scholarships are offered to Māori and Pacific students studying pharmacy to help address the need within our communities for more Māori and Pacific pharmacists.
