This series of videos exemplifies what this looked like in Manukorihi Intermediate as they problem solved this as part of their intervention.<br> <br>For more information, visit Team Solutions at

the<br>things we'd noticed that some children<br>were perhaps not being independent they<br>were queuing in to other students and we<br>wanted all our students to have that<br>belief that they were problem solvers<br>and could read strategically and<br>independently we've seen some things<br>that we weren't happy worth children<br>coming through an end of red yellow even<br>further whose concepts about print we're<br>kind of incorrect that they thought that<br>it was just memorizing or listening to<br>your buddy<br>when you have a guided reading group and<br>they're all sitting in a circle around<br>you we get children who just tagged off<br>the person who's good on that group and<br>repeat exactly what's being said so they<br>get through the reading without ever<br>having to attempt any strategy at<br>difficulty Eli and your partner and<br>crime camera and you two are going to<br>come and read with me so we started to<br>shift these children outward so away<br>from each other and go to the reading<br>over the shoulder or the teacher going<br>over the shoulder and the children<br>reading and independently so you said to<br>me you've read this before but you<br>haven't have you know Kari yeah so it's<br>similar to one that you've seen before<br>who are the people in the book granddad<br>and William and they were in the<br>earmuffs book as well weren't they so if<br>it's a new book we would introduce it<br>with the short introduction on the cover<br>page you certainly wouldn't see a<br>teacher going page by page through a<br>book and explaining all the tricky words<br>or interesting phrases what you would<br>see is a quick introduction enough to<br>enable the students to access the text<br>and the teachers know their lunes very<br>well and they know what's going to<br>challenge the awareness and what will<br>support the aloneness how does that<br>start hmm you know lots of words now<br>that start with w I try and have one a<br>year on what's going on and we know I<br>can hear just a consistent reading or if<br>they've gone quiet I'm doing like a mini<br>running record as they go along seeing<br>what they do at er√§ what's tripping them<br>up<br>what are these strategies when<br>gets stuck by using meaning do they know<br>the chunks to try and break it up yeah<br>let's go from here because this was<br>after cuddle told her about the Stars<br>wasn't it I'm looking for fluency I'm<br>looking for what does the child do it<br>difficulty I'm looking for the<br>strategies that they are using the<br>strategies that they're not using that<br>peps they should be using and if the<br>book is obviously too hard then we would<br>go back or have another book I'm still<br>doing the same teaching but I'm teaching<br>them individually within a group so<br>they're getting taught to their<br>individual needs and their next learning<br>steps and so what I'm trying to do when<br>I move around the groups is notice where<br>one child might be making an error at<br>one word or another child might be doing<br>something completely different and so<br>it's a case of teaching them all what<br>they need to do if they are still<br>beginning readers magenta they will stay<br>at the desk and we would be looking for<br>that one-to-one and directionality soon<br>as they head around about read to read<br>three they are reading independently but<br>it's still quite close to each other in<br>close to me you can come around here<br>further camryn for me please as we go up<br>through the levels then we go further<br>away from each other and I circulate the<br>children who are in the higher levels<br>know when they get to difficulty and<br>they've tried a number of strategies<br>they will come to me and they have their<br>finger on the word and so don't not so<br>we will then work through it with them<br>where is stuck Kayla okay so go from the<br>start and see if we can fix it up by and<br>large honesty has not been a problem<br>they've been pretty good perfect thank<br>you<br>we don't do children who first start at<br>school because we want to support them<br>so they have a very clear idea of what<br>readings about and readings about<br>looking and it's about attending to<br>meaning and it's about solving problems<br>to get to the meaning and because have<br>to have some basic understanding of that<br>they also need to know some of the nuts<br>and bolts like which way to go and the<br>difference between words and these are<br>some of those really key early literacy<br>understandings so we have to wait to let<br>someplace<br>I'd periodically try and do running<br>records during my reading groups because<br>it makes sense to get it done during<br>reading time and I use it to decide<br>whether it text us too hard or too easy<br>or whether that child's really to move<br>on or just to document what they're<br>doing in error I also have a couple of<br>children who find a running record is a<br>testing tool quite stressful so doing<br>that within the whole class situation<br>takes some of their test anxiety out of<br>the situation as well I think we really<br>just jumped straight into it and it<br>seemed to be seamless the children<br>enjoyed doing it because suddenly they<br>were able to read at their own pace<br>suddenly they were able to independently<br>try strategies on their own without some<br>nodal actually doing it before they were<br>able to do the thinking and so it<br>actually worked into our reading program<br>very quickly and easily I don't remember<br>any issues I just said today we're going<br>to read on the floor they're very<br>adaptable they were fine the key thing<br>is the belief that students are quite<br>capable of solving their own problems of<br>using their skills flexibly and underpin<br>utley provided they've been taught the<br>skills that they bring a base knowledge<br>to the task and provided that being set<br>up for success in are you gonna catch<br>the words for me are you really sure<br>and I have no doubt that this<br>independence feeds into these children<br>becoming self regulated learners in<br>other areas so they're very keen to cope<br>on their own fantastic good work I think<br>the children that got to a level and<br>then basically stopped so we probably<br>say about blue is when it got all too<br>hard and getting them from blue to green<br>became a real issue now the children who<br>have gone through this process right<br>from the word go have progressed pretty<br>quickly actually and we do have evident<br>for that 80% of our year ones get to<br>standard so we were looking at that 20%</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
