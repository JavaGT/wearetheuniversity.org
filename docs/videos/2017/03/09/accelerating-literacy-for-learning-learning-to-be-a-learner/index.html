This series of videos exemplifies what this looked like in Manukorihi Intermediate as they problem solved this as part of their intervention.<br> <br>For more information, visit Team Solutions at http://www.education.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/professional-development/team-solutions-home.html.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>grasshoppers you have your reading<br>contract to work on and it's all in your<br>book boxes you need to work quietly on<br>that when they come down to the mat I<br>don't think they see this hard work it's<br>fun and I'm there to support them and<br>they can do it and I believe in them and<br>we're going to do it together and it'll<br>be fine and that's part of the adventure<br>of being at school so it's always about<br>their children finding their own way<br>taking responsibility for what they're<br>doing and it's become an expectation<br>some of that is very explicit talk<br>actually about leading behaviors and<br>what learners do some of it as a skill<br>of the teacher like for instance having<br>wait time that's crucial not jumping in<br>and solving the problem not prompting<br>and cueing too early and we achieve that<br>message with our parents to say that<br>message is coming through and lots of<br>different ways now I just want to go<br>back to here and I want you to reread<br>that because it didn't sound right they<br>can use the strategies that we talked<br>about themselves and so they become in<br>charge of their learning and that's the<br>magical thing about this is that they do<br>what they need to do when you are put in<br>the position of being an independent<br>learner you do have a go because you see<br>zeros come into a really established<br>classroom and so teaching them the<br>routines of school and the expected<br>behaviors is quite easy because they<br>have so many amazing role models<br>yeah now as far as groupings goes most<br>of my groupings in the classroom are<br>mixed ability as much as I can they<br>learn pretty quickly the sorts of things<br>that are happening in the classroom and<br>what the expectations are we talk a lot<br>about the learning pit and how we might<br>go into the leaning focus things are<br>really tough but we find out what we<br>need ask for help if we need it then<br>we'll get up and out but it's a<br>continuous process they become<br>responsible for their own learning and<br>that is the aim to make them independent<br>lifelong learners and to give them the<br>resilience to try things fine if they<br>make a mistake it's absolutely fine they<br>know that and they just keep on going in<br>compared to the old system there is hard<br>evidence that we are getting movement<br>with children that previously have got<br>stuck at certain levels now teachers see<br>children progressing I see children<br>engaged with the Aluna mercy children<br>taking responsibility for the learning<br>and they see children really enjoying me<br>leaning and I think that gives a huge<br>sense of satisfaction and pride because<br>they feel feeling confident about the<br>practice they are able to share when<br>things are challenging and ask for<br>support from colleagues I think that's a<br>huge part of what we've developed here<br>now I feel really proud of them just to<br>see that agent C and then joy and<br>satisfaction and then nothing at out</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
