This series of videos exemplifies what this looked like in Manukorihi Intermediate as they problem solved this as part of their intervention.<br> <br>For more information, visit Team Solutions at http://www.education.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/professional-development/team-solutions-home.html.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>you<br>we really believe that all children have<br>the ability to achieve and to manage<br>their own behaviors and we're very aware<br>that students have that responsibility<br>often in the early childhood center part<br>of our thinking was wanting that smooth<br>transition from a center where they were<br>very obviously self regulated to the<br>school setting we had also done a huge<br>amount of study into the value of play<br>and we saw that that was the natural<br>venue for students to develop those<br>skills anything on the choices board for<br>your group doing there's probably no<br>such thing as just playing<br>we've always a team done a lot of<br>reading around the value of play and all<br>that oral language and conversation that<br>goes on all that really sort of life<br>skills that they can do during play and<br>processing the world around them and<br>that's there I have a choices board on<br>the wall so that each group has three<br>choices but as the years gone on I've<br>become much less hung up about them<br>staying on those choices they can choose<br>whatever activities they like but I<br>start the year out like that so that we<br>don't end up with eight children on one<br>activity but all the activities are very<br>play based and very open-ended we have<br>our class guidelines of sharing and<br>using our words and working as a team<br>and they can just do their family and<br>they know tidy up and pick up and move<br>on to the next thing we have to provide<br>opportunities for students to develop<br>resilience your stamina and their<br>ability to persevere things like giving<br>them skills to problem-solve that's the<br>thing that will carry over into other<br>learnings so there's a whole impetus on<br>the social and emotional well-being of<br>the students and setting them up for<br>those things before they face with<br>academic tasks their play is very<br>childhood and I really leave it up to<br>them someone was playing dinosaurs<br>yesterday and they'll be playing cats or<br>cows crawling around and mooing Wow you<br>have been so busy whereas Mahara<br>is usually a challenge set today you<br>need to make Mahara place in the train<br>station and what a good job they did and<br>you're the train dryly<br>so you hit so you have to cross over the<br>road to get to the change you do<br>brilliant well done everybody so I have<br>no doubt that this independence which we<br>certainly are doing in our reading<br>sessions feeds into these children<br>becoming self regulated learners in<br>other areas we are providing children<br>with an appropriate and challenging<br>environment so that within that they are<br>making choices and feel strong ownership<br>and I think that's why they've got the<br>intensity because they've had a lot of<br>choice and ownership and they are<br>applying themselves they're not doing a<br>lot of stuff that's imposed on them<br>they're growing and learning hugely but<br>then control of their own learning and<br>play has been particularly successful</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
