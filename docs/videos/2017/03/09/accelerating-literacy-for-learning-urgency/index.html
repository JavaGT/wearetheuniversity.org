This series of videos exemplifies what this looked like in Manukorihi Intermediate as they problem solved this as part of their intervention.<br> <br>For more information, visit Team Solutions at http://www.education.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/professional-development/team-solutions-home.html.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I try and read to them at least three<br>times a day I'm sure I've been told five<br>but I probably manage about three<br>picture books a day because I just want<br>them to be excited about books all of us<br>here teach our reading with intensity I<br>think there's just a sense of urgency<br>about the way we approach reading and<br>real passion and drive to move on and<br>fast with the reading and do it well and<br>that's a class sculpture<br>I am relentless we read and write every<br>day for those particularly emergent<br>readers and writers so every day they<br>are reading and it's an every part of<br>the day holiday perfect you've got it<br>are you ready to read there is an<br>urgency here we want all our students to<br>achieve at the highest possible level<br>because we believe if they're doing that<br>they've got greater choice and greater<br>opportunities it's easier for them to<br>access the curriculum so we share with<br>students where they are and where they<br>need to go we show them the long picture<br>and as teachers we meet together<br>regularly and constantly problem-solve<br>we look at all the children's<br>achievement and our syndicate every few<br>weeks and we've got eight classes so<br>that's a lot of children but we go<br>through and look at every child that we<br>feel is below or as lacking in<br>confidence or we have some concern about<br>and we all problem-solve about the best<br>ways to support them may push themselves<br>since I put my little reading flower up<br>the wall with four different colors they<br>all know who they are and I think I'm on<br>green and I want to be on orange and I'm<br>blond blue and I really want to be on<br>green and I hear them talking about that<br>with each other as well so there's a<br>little sense of agency amongst them we<br>gather data on what students constantly<br>and because we gather all this data it's<br>easy to look across to see where<br>interventions are effective if they're<br>not we look for something else to do<br>because that doesn't work for their<br>child or those children we know children<br>can learn if a child's not learning we<br>have to look at our practice so we do a<br>lot of problems sharing we constantly<br>are engaged in professional development<br>now there might only be a small thing<br>like watching a clip reading a research<br>paper<br>at our team meetings which we have once<br>a week but always always it's bubbling<br>at the top of our consciousness we<br>always continue to revisit Andrea dress<br>when I first came in as a beginning<br>teacher my expectations of what year<br>ones could achieve in their reading or<br>what could be expected of them I don't<br>think it was high enough my own<br>expectations have been raised and it's<br>just infectious in my classroom you<br>start saying oh if it's amazing elites<br>push on as we work together they build<br>that teaching knowledge so they've<br>actually got the tools and their own<br>toolkit to challenge the students so<br>while the students are getting<br>challenged the teachers also have been<br>open to challenge and questioning their<br>own practice and sharing their practice<br>and that's enabled us to keep moving the<br>kid salon because we're keeping on<br>moving on and we have a lot of inter<br>class visits between teachers and if a<br>teacher has a particular needs then<br>they'll be released to go and watch<br>someone who's able to do that more<br>efficiently or has a different way of<br>doing it I mean when you're coming with<br>your data week after week and bringing<br>your writing books and bringing your<br>running records and analyzing those<br>things to look for patterns and when<br>you're sharing what you're doing it<br>actually breaks down those walls between<br>classrooms</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
