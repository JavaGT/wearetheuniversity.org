font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the Secretary of Science sustainability<br>network is a group of people who are<br>interested in sustainability and running<br>projects and initiatives affords<br>sustainability and the faculty and it<br>started last year when I was appointed<br>as associate dean sustainability and<br>went to all the departments and schools<br>and service units and asked anyone who<br>would like to be involved everybody<br>within the faculty that has an interest<br>was invited to join with the supporter<br>network and there's a smaller group to<br>mesosphere agreements which I'm a member<br>but membership the great cross-section<br>of academic staff professional staff to<br>include staff everybody was a good idea<br>within the group that are just<br>progresses you develop some of internet<br>go through music the university is a<br>major institution in Auckland and and<br>New Zealand and there's two really<br>important roles we play one is just<br>sheer operational you know we've just<br>got a lot of people and a lot of things<br>happening and it's really important that<br>we do that in a sustainable away as<br>possible but the other thing of course<br>as we're a learning institution and if<br>we can forward sustainability it's not<br>just for us as this microcosm but it's<br>for all these people that are going out<br>there and taking that identity with them<br>into the world the kind of the<br>environmentally focused approach in<br>terms of nurturing and caring for our<br>environment with the kind of social<br>based approach where we look at<br>sustainability issues by neutering and<br>caring for each other and then there are<br>the kind of practical solutions that<br>will actually make a difference one of<br>our projects involves the teaching a<br>case study and we've got two departments<br>that have come together to do the<br>psychology and chemistry and in their<br>primary discipline they all have a<br>couple of mixtures on the clothing<br>industry now what's the psychology<br>behind that why despite the fact that<br>we're all good people do we wear clothes<br>that I mean manufactures often creating<br>toxins into the environment and other<br>people on very low wages so how do we<br>manage that<br>illogically then from a chemistry<br>perspective is actually really cool ways<br>in which you can reduce the toxic effect<br>to dye through using new technology so<br>we bought them all together a couple of<br>chemistry students visiting each site<br>tutorial being subject matter experts<br>interpreting these chemical chemistry<br>concepts around our sustainability green<br>chemistry issues for the site students<br>and they in turn do from the site<br>students develop psychological theories<br>and the feedback we had from all of them<br>is that it went really well<br>the university is a bit like a city<br>there's a lot of processes a lot of them<br>are centralized and you can't<br>necessarily change things overnight they<br>don't to do so a lot of our focuses on<br>the things that we can do the composting<br>project is a really excellent example of<br>that working directly with the ground<br>staff we've been able to have a compost<br>bin to which we can empty our small<br>burns from our staffers we can all do<br>that so we're about encouraging those<br>kinds of things purchasing you can<br>choose the more sustainable options<br>recycling as being a better focus<br>reducing the number of disposable items<br>that you use but we're also about the<br>policies that we need to support that so<br>we're not just going to do the things<br>that are immediately available but but<br>also encourage the university to be<br>braver and more adventurous and go<br>further and in our policies and in our<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
