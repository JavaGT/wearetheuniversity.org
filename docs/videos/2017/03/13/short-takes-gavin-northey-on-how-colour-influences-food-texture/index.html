font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so essentially whenever anyone is asked<br>to describe food or they ask a question<br>of someone else about the food they<br>happen to be eating you'll almost always<br>hear them talk about the taste whether<br>it's the saltiness the sweetness the<br>bitterness etc it might be something<br>about the smell or the beautiful bouquet<br>of the the food that they're eating or<br>sometimes they talk about the texture in<br>their mouth as well<br>very rarely though will people talk<br>about the actual visual aspects and<br>particularly the color there is some<br>research that looks at the influence of<br>color on smell however we found that<br>there was there was almost nothing that<br>had looked at the influence of color on<br>the perceived texture in your mouth so<br>when we started this research we<br>actually we actually used a whole range<br>of products and we found that color also<br>influences the the texture of the food<br>in particular the creaminess and<br>crunchiness when you consume a product<br>what we did was we then took that to the<br>next dimension and said maybe we get the<br>same effects if we if we change the<br>color of the products in an advertising<br>context and we had similar sort of<br>results in that color was found to<br>influence the expected texture<br>particularly the creaminess and<br>crunchiness of the food product just by<br>looking at the the advertisement we used<br>a whole range of products including<br>yogurt custard sour cream and mayonnaise<br>just to ensure that it wasn't<br>necessarily the product that was causing<br>the effect it was the actual color so in<br>the advertisements we had we had a<br>similar sort of situation although the<br>thing that we we changed or manipulated<br>more or less was the appearance so<br>whether it was a crunchy and looking<br>product or a creamier so a creamier<br>potato salad maybe as opposed to what<br>would be sort of a crunchy adverse or<br>anniversary of a crunchy cookie and and<br>what we found was that the red product<br>would would sort of skew towards the<br>expected creaminess and the blue filters<br>over the products made made people sort<br>of more predisposed to thinking that<br>there was a crunchy product to look at<br>the influence of color when people are<br>actually consuming the product you know<br>we had a whole range of experiments<br>where we manipulated the color so it was<br>either red and blue of the different<br>food products as well as the textures so<br>some of the products were definitely<br>crunchy and some of them were were<br>definitely constructed to be creamier<br>because we wanted to see if there was an<br>interaction between the the color and<br>the actual texture of the product in<br>determining you know the person's<br>experience there's an international<br>standard for flavor which is you know it<br>basically says that flavor consists of<br>the taste that comes through your mouth<br>the smell that comes through your nose<br>and then the the texture that you<br>experience inside your mouth it may be<br>that the color or vision is actually the<br>fourth dimension of flavor that no one<br>has really considered just because it's<br>so intuitive and obvious and having<br>identified the effect it would now be up<br>to the brand managers and the food<br>scientists that work with them to to<br>find out the sweet spot for their<br>particular product and the product<br>attributes that they're trying to<br>communicate this goes right through the<br>right through the line so what you would<br>be thinking is that or if a brand<br>manager and a team of food scientists<br>have a product in mind and they want to<br>position it in the market as having very<br>particular kinds of product attributes<br>in in our situation it would be a<br>creaminess or a crunchiness what they<br>really need to look at is the color of<br>the product that they're developing from<br>the get-go needs to be congruent with<br>the product attributes that they're<br>trying to communicate what you would<br>also<br>then think about is packaging<br>point-of-sale materials that actually<br>are occurring in the shopping centers or<br>the supermarkets you may want them to be<br>a certain a certain look and then all of<br>the communications that you have in the<br>marketing collateral that you provide as<br>we've seen the the color of the<br>advertisements will distinctly influence<br>the the consumer expectations now what<br>we also found in our in our research is<br>that the types of language that you used<br>to describe it also has an influence on<br>the effect of the color so there is a<br>there is a you know based on a kind of<br>condition or a finding called Stroop<br>interference where the color and the<br>language actually interact to influence<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
