Trump would say<br>it's not fake news well it might be but<br>you know Newsweek is a respectable<br>magazine of some description and they<br>have a headline that says batteries will<br>save the planet so this is why it's a<br>motive okay and this is even far worse<br>though this is one of our commissioners<br>Europe is a federation essentially the<br>commissioners are effectively cabinet<br>ministers in in a federation if you want<br>okay they're not elected though and this<br>is a man called Marcus I can never<br>pronounce a second name and he states<br>that smart grids balancing intermittent<br>solar and wind energy will flex the part<br>a man could do for Europe what shale gas<br>has done for United States a more<br>nonsense statement you couldn't make in<br>your entire life it's rubbish<br>mind you it was said on the first of<br>April which have to wonder was it if an<br>April Fool's joke I had lunch with the<br>guy he actually believes this which is<br>it is a real shame and but then again<br>you get some people saying really stupid<br>things you know Eddie Jones how Engler<br>would beat the All Blacks oh that's<br>nonsense - but then Ireland did beat<br>them a few weeks later<br>so and then you could go talk about mr.<br>Trump SH anyway<br>stuff happens so my research involvement<br>in this in the area of storage and<br>demand side is actually I mean I'd<br>always sound negative<br>I've got involved in it not because I'm<br>a believer but because it's something<br>that people talk about and therefore I<br>think people like me have to give it<br>some have to define exactly how good<br>about it is my main claim to fame is<br>renewable integration and I've done a<br>lot of that and I got involved in<br>storage and demand-side not because I<br>believe it's fundamentally a big item I<br>just so many people are interested in<br>it's time to do some work in it to try<br>and bring some objectivity to us so<br>somebody met me and said you've<br>published papers in demand side I have<br>but if you look at them I'm not exactly<br>saying it's going to solve everything so<br>I'm not a believer<br>I'm just been objective okay at least I<br>hope so<br>so there so the two things that are the<br>two major things that have been involved<br>in the last couple of years that are<br>relevant to storage and demand side are<br>at the European Academy of Sciences so<br>it's all the science academies if Europe<br>come together they have this terrific<br>Academy Sciences energy panel I'm a<br>member of it and I chaired a group<br>that's doing a store a study on storage<br>isaque electricity storage study value<br>and dedicated storage electricity grids<br>it's not actually published yet will be<br>published sometimes in mid 2017 we spent<br>two or three years doing this report so<br>I mean I've gained a lot of experience<br>from that I've also made some very good<br>electro chemists and people are into<br>technology and then this study from the<br>Department of Energy United States we<br>did in 2011 it's a demand response in<br>energy storage integration study so<br>these are two you know main European<br>study in a u.s. study I was a scientific<br>advisor and the one on the right and one<br>of the left and the Chairman so I'm just<br>trying to make the point that I have<br>very products but I'm not an expert in a<br>lot of these things but very broad<br>experience that I bring to this so let's<br>talk about storage<br>I'll deal with storage then I'll deal<br>with demand side and out right but they<br>are very similar does everyone know why<br>they're similar does everybody know why<br>they're similar<br>yeah well it means start storage storage<br>dedicated storage as I put energy into<br>something I take it back<br>demand-side to some extent is that you<br>delay using the energy and give it so<br>you shift the energy around so the some<br>extent they're similar but they're not<br>the same they are similar though and<br>they're both very topical at the moment<br>so you can deal with them together but<br>you must know that they are different so<br>if you look at a lek tricity storage<br>technology the main oh yeah this is the<br>first time I've ever given a talk where<br>wine is syrup before hand so I don't<br>think he should serve wine to an Irish<br>mountain of the day before st. Patrick's<br>Day and and it's Pinot Noir which I<br>really like I really like Pinot Noir so<br>it's my favorite it's my favorite wine<br>so if you look electricity storage<br>technology in the world today most the<br>storage technologies is pumped hydro<br>storage PHS which is here in the blue<br>like it's 95 percent of the install<br>capacity is pumped hydro the rest of it<br>then is in batteries flywheels etc over<br>here so pretty much this is the bulk of<br>it okay if you look at the history of it<br>though of Pont hydro storage the picture<br>on the left shows two lakes 100 sacktual<br>e palm storage station in R and the<br>station itself is inside the mountain<br>okay but the lake on the bottom was<br>natural the lake on the top was built by<br>a bunch of civil engineers in Paducah be<br>whole and and if you take the data so<br>this data comes from DIA the IEA asked<br>me and my colleagues to do a Liberty to<br>work on storage and we asked them for<br>the I the OECD data on nuclear build and<br>storage pumped hydro storage build in<br>the world and we plotted them and you<br>know there's the plots they are the real<br>I'm not saying cause and effect yeah I'm<br>not saying cause and effect but in fact<br>if you talk to some of the engineers who<br>you know we're in GE or Westinghouse or<br>some of those people who were you know<br>now retired they will tell you that<br>largely speaking that pomme tired of<br>storage was been built while nuclear and<br>built because nuclear was very<br>inflexible<br>base loaded plant okay and they sort of<br>felt they couldn't turn it off you know<br>a loofah is not exactly flexible you<br>don't want to mess with it and they sort<br>of said well maybe we should store the<br>energy during the<br>when we're not using it and also at the<br>peak right it was generally oiled so you<br>had a nuclear at the base boil at the<br>peak the price spread was enormous now<br>I'm not saying that's a generality for<br>the whole world but that's effectively<br>what was happening in United States in<br>Europe so you had base loaded nuclear at<br>nice peak oil and the price spread was<br>nearly five times I mean our generation<br>is very expensive so in fact the driver<br>behind Pumped hydro storage was<br>essentially nuclear and then would oil<br>at the peak and they then flatten out<br>around the nineteen what is it yeah the<br>nineteen in 1990s come along 1980s and<br>what happens is that we suddenly<br>realized that all this gas that were<br>flaring off in the atmosphere you<br>actually use it for something useful<br>people invent a combined cycle gas<br>turbines and all of a sudden there was a<br>dash for gas if you look at most games<br>generality but if you look at most<br>systems in the world today the large<br>ones the base that they're what sets the<br>price at night and what set surprise<br>today is largely gas and gas largely but<br>not always so the price bread has has<br>collapsed therefore there's no economic<br>reason for pump out of storage now that<br>is I'm not saying we've done a rigorous<br>study on it that's the data these are<br>the stories I've been told by my<br>colleagues who are retired and I think<br>it makes a lot of sense so that's why it<br>is that's why that's why there's an<br>awful lot of pom tighter on the system<br>started so you can discount it now<br>because the reason for building it is<br>gone and in fact nobody I know in the<br>world is currently building the Pumped<br>hydro station I've heard people say<br>they're building it but I've never<br>actually heard anyone say to finished<br>one this was all sorts of stories about<br>it if I even find someone build them one<br>let me know I think in China there might<br>be better than one but then again in<br>China they build also two things if you<br>go to Island applications the gentleman<br>in the the gentleman with the jeans and<br>the check shirt is a man called Nick<br>Miller when he was very much younger<br>than he is now he's a friend of mine in<br>GE and he installed this is an this is a<br>it's actually on the mainland in Alaska<br>but it's an island system in terms of<br>electricity because it's so remote and<br>it's called I can't remember it's meta<br>I can never pronounce it<br>you can see it there it's some small<br>community in Alaska it's almost down<br>beside Canada and you know if you are<br>generating electricity there how you<br>doing it you're actually sending you<br>know fuel oil from from Alaska down by<br>pipeline to the US they refine it and<br>then they send look like ship to<br>generate electricity<br>so it's enormous ly expensive I can be<br>electricity there is four or five six<br>times what it is on the mainland so to<br>speak so it's very expensive so in very<br>expensive very remote areas batteries do<br>make sense yeah they do make sense and<br>in fact that set of batteries was<br>replace recently so there are business<br>cases where it does work but in general<br>it doesn't so recently a Nick Miller and<br>some of his colleagues wrote this<br>article in 2012 and it said look before<br>you leap the role of energy storage in<br>the grid and they actually use this as a<br>case study they say look you can put it<br>on Islands but does it make it make<br>sense generally and the answer is no<br>economically it does not make sense<br>Germany then you have yeah I'm going to<br>talk mainly about wind because wind is<br>the area I know best but solar is<br>similar if you want okay so this is an<br>article in the I Triple E power energy<br>magazine again you can actually see Nick<br>Miller's name there my name there so we<br>wrote this article wind power myths<br>debunked there's lots of myths about<br>wind power you know where I don't know<br>you know just lots of myths about it<br>anyway doesn't have any capacity value<br>and one of the myths is that we need<br>storage it's completely and absolutely<br>untrue and yet people keep saying it it<br>does not need storage be nice to have it<br>but it doesn't need it it doesn't need<br>it at all so if you look at storage and<br>demand response together with wind and<br>solar you know the things that they that<br>wind that storage and demand response<br>can do you know within intermittent<br>source like wind or solar is a you know<br>energy arbitrage so you know sometimes<br>you have to dump the wind sometimes you<br>got too much of it sometimes you've got<br>too much solar so you can do arbitrage<br>you can store us for a later time that's<br>one application ancillary services you<br>can produce reserves etc with storage<br>and wind generally needs more ancillary<br>services and solar does too<br>capacity value so the capacity value<br>effectively it's not a specialist all is<br>all I say is that it's a value it's a<br>it's a quantification of the yeah it's a<br>quantification of the amount of extra<br>customers you can serve and maintain the<br>same level of reliability with a<br>generator so if I have a 100 megawatt<br>January and it's capacity value is 80%<br>it means you can serve 80 megawatts more<br>load continuously during the year<br>maintain the same level of reliability<br>you can never be great in 100% obviously<br>and the reason it's below 100% is<br>because of maintenance and because<br>sometimes it breaks down okay so the<br>pastevalues so storage can produce<br>capacity value network investment<br>deferral some people say that you know<br>if if you want to build a new piece in<br>network you can you can avoid it by<br>putting in storage or demand-side these<br>are all the application areas okay and<br>they are you know stories in the bands<br>that are good compatible fit with these<br>things but the question is is it worth<br>it you know because storage is very<br>expensive yeah I mean battery storage<br>pumped hydro are extremely expensive in<br>fact if you do the numbers honors a<br>storage device will always be more well<br>I could get shot for this someday but<br>I've said it many times around the world<br>no one has ever told me I'm wrong so<br>I'll say it here now storage device is<br>always more expensive than its<br>equivalent generator and the reason is<br>is because you have to have a generator<br>plus some sort of storage device civil<br>engineering works chemicals whatever and<br>so effective you sort of say to yourself<br>you know combined cycle gas turbine in a<br>five and a megawatt storage device of<br>500 Watts the storage device will always<br>be more expensive because you have to go<br>you know yeah drill a hole in a mountain<br>or something like that so generally<br>speaking of more expensive and also<br>they've round trip efficiency losses<br>what goes in does not come out and those<br>losses although people will call him at<br>90 percent and 80 percent generally<br>speaking in real operation they're much<br>lower much much lower they always it's<br>like the car salesman sells you the car<br>and says that we get 75 you know miles<br>per gallon but that's only if you're you<br>know seven-year old lady's driving on<br>the motorway perfect weather etc you<br>know you're not like me trying to rush<br>to something you get sixty so generally<br>speaking they have around to be<br>efficiencies are far less than 70<br>percenter certainly Celeste so the<br>question is is are they worth it so<br>let's talk about the place I'm from<br>Ireland so we do have a pump storage<br>station there it is there it's called<br>trailer kill it's a two hundred ninety<br>two megawatt station and has six hours<br>worth of storage so here's a question<br>for you and I'm not going to go on<br>unless so many answers it the total<br>energy that's stored in that device<br>would last for how long in the AR system<br>you should display the entire energy<br>system from us quick calculation it's<br>290 megawatts lasts for six hours how<br>much energy you know if I was to take<br>that energy and say you know I couldn't<br>I only could use that energy for the<br>no who said 10 minutes<br>anyone else huh<br>six hours is it you want to bottle the<br>wine because they're going to give me a<br>bottle of wine after this and I can't<br>I hope it was for me was it given a man<br>who's gonna travel on an airplane a<br>bottle of wine is not a sensible idea<br>you can ship it to me though it lasts 20<br>minutes okay so does not a lot of energy<br>storage in two seconds the point if you<br>look at these pictures though this is us<br>visiting Turrell Achilles or some<br>students it's a great site to visit you<br>know it's literally a you know okay they<br>dug a tunnel into it they took a big or<br>they put a big drill the big hole etc<br>it's a big civil engineering project an<br>interesting thing is that this lady here<br>there is called Neve O'Connell and this<br>is 2005 and this is knees pH TTS in the<br>2015 and she worked in demand response<br>and I was a co supervisor in DTU<br>so that's pom storage in Ireland we do<br>have one and I'm gonna say some more<br>about it later if you look at wind in<br>Ireland here here it is over the past 16<br>or 17 years<br>we currently guess well this is 2017<br>this year we're probably going to get<br>26% of all our electricity from wind<br>okay yeah Ireland has the highest<br>penetration of wind power in the world<br>of any synchro's power system there's no<br>water system that's a sink respire<br>system the house so um<br>26% if you'd look at 2011 there and in<br>2011 the pump storage station we had was<br>out on maintenance well actually one of<br>them went out in maintenance and they<br>found a crack in it and turns out all<br>four of them had it it was one of those<br>systemic put in mind Judy's a forty<br>years old so they took the entire<br>station out of action system still round<br>fine<br>a little bit more expensive because of<br>ancillary services but nonetheless the<br>system survived and the interconnector<br>was down as well with the UK so for a<br>whole year we survived with nearly 18<br>percent win no problems whatsoever<br>running the system okay and we were<br>asked in in 20 2008 we did a study for<br>the Irish government to see how far we<br>could go and they set a target a forty<br>percent on the basis of our study our<br>going to forty percent by 2020 and in<br>the study we did not include storage and<br>the reason we did include storage is<br>because me and a pH<br>student sat down one day looked at us<br>and in 20 minutes in the back of an<br>envelope we decided to expensive I mean<br>the engineers can do calculations like<br>that yeah it's easy it's very easy but<br>then we were asked well you know the<br>public doesn't believe you blah-dee-blah<br>so we had to go off and do the numbers<br>right and we did the numbers and this<br>shows you the net savings with storage<br>on the RS system now<br>I won't go into the whole details of<br>this study but fundamentally if you look<br>at Anakin's above the line it turns out<br>there's a net saving below the line it<br>doesn't do the net loss okay so it<br>passes through the line of 51 percent so<br>once you go over 51 percent win in our<br>system average energy it turns out that<br>the economics of storage may actually<br>make sense however here's the<br>fundamental question we didn't compare<br>with anything else<br>we didn't say there was an option to<br>build more transmission we didn't you<br>know we didn't compare it<br>we just said that's the only thing you<br>can do when does it make sense before<br>that before 50 percent you wouldn't<br>build it if you built it before 50<br>percent it would be a poor investment<br>right if you built it after 50 percent<br>be good investment but we did not<br>compare with other options and if you<br>compare with other options it loses so<br>that is the best case scenario 50<br>percent so storage applications and its<br>competitors so this is this ie a study<br>that we did we did a table the thing<br>about storage is it has so which one is<br>it's the kid it has no chance because<br>its storage is there any is okay does<br>this system there New Zealand does it<br>have any now I know it has a lot of<br>hydro that's not what I'm talking about<br>does it have any dedicated storage where<br>you take electricity convert into some<br>other form and take it back the answer<br>there's a four-letter words with are you<br>at the end of it I would say what test<br>fine all right<br>a one megawatt job okay but it's a it's<br>it's a demo yeah yeah okay right okay so<br>you've a little bit of storage but it<br>doesn't but it yes but you didn't buy<br>commercially did you eli most gay with<br>you because he's off tomorrow's new left<br>at you or something like that<br>simplify camera is it doesn't make any<br>economic sense but does nothing storage<br>can do okay so you have some here but<br>you didn't have us there's nothing this<br>system worked fine without a tin can<br>there's nothing storage can do that's<br>yep yeah yeah<br>ya know so first of all I'm talking<br>about dedicated storage here electricity<br>and electricity out so that's not the<br>same thing but also you didn't need that<br>you could have bought more generation or<br>whatever yeah so the point I'm trying to<br>make is it doesn't bring anything<br>fundamental the system a generator about<br>wind power wind plants well turns wind<br>into electricity is pretty fundamental<br>yeah so they're pretty fundamentally<br>need if you need wind solar hydro or<br>whatever transmission lines are needed<br>cuz you're not gonna live without the<br>generation to get at that customer<br>they're pretty fundamental and you're<br>gonna have to reconvert the electricity<br>into some other useful form so various<br>motors are needed so those three<br>components are needed transformers<br>they're not fundamental but they make<br>the economics better so they all have<br>fundamental roles that cannot be<br>replaced storage has no fundamental role<br>it's a nice to have but not necessary<br>and there's nothing it can do that<br>something else can't do and generally<br>nothing it can do that's something else<br>can't do cheaper as well so that's one<br>of the problems of storage it has no<br>fundamental sort of niche in the market<br>if you look at flexibility as a you know<br>people talk about flexibility power<br>system this slide I'm sorry the bonds<br>could off I used a lot of slides my<br>colleagues around the world and I<br>usually put their names at the bottom<br>and I have done here but you can't see<br>it so this is you hockey voluma he's a<br>from vtg in finland so he did an<br>analysis of all the different<br>flexibility options and you know you can<br>question how he did the study but<br>nonetheless you can see there that<br>storage which is up here you know<br>actually you know is negative value and<br>maybe a little bit of positive value<br>depending this is sort of storage as it<br>isn't batteries now batteries 50 percent<br>cheaper than than they are currently now<br>they might start making a bit of sense<br>but look at this transmission is much<br>cheaper these are heat pumps varium heat<br>pumps are not cheap but they're better<br>than storage so you get a situation<br>where storage is essentially not a great<br>competitor against all these things then<br>you talk about things that are not sort<br>of physical things you say wind<br>forecasting so if you say to yourself I<br>need storage because I don't know what<br>the wind is going to do not so that's a<br>reasonable a reasonable thing to say<br>because if you don't know what the wind<br>is going to do you might end up with too<br>much wind too little with et cetera so<br>forecasting is<br>the technology is sort of a service that<br>you can put instead in the same study<br>that I showed that the lion costume to<br>50% we did the numbers on this you know<br>it's a it's a complicated grass graph<br>but if you look at stuck hot stochastic<br>means we're taking into account wind<br>forecast we have a wind forecaster okay<br>perfect means that we have we're saying<br>we can perfectly forecast the wind okay<br>and there's no storage and written<br>without storage if you look at it if you<br>compare them if you just take so take if<br>you if you compare stochastic to perfect<br>which is the red to the green the red to<br>the green and in the other case if the<br>blue to the purple right and and then if<br>you take the difference between them and<br>storage and no storage which is between<br>there and there and there and there you<br>suddenly realize that the gap between<br>perfect forecasting and regular<br>forecasting is actually bigger than it<br>is between storage and non storage now<br>I'm not saying this is quantitatively<br>true but the point of trying to make is<br>you probably better off spend their<br>money on improving the forecast you<br>probably get more bang for your buck<br>than you would for storage<br>I still what the graph is basically<br>trying to tell you so there's all sorts<br>of different ways so not only your<br>technology is able to compete against it<br>but having better information better<br>forecasting can also compete against it<br>as well so this study was there this is<br>the one that was done by the US by the<br>DA that came out a couple years ago that<br>I was a scientific adviser on if you<br>look at its storage low value in<br>declines rapidly so one of the things<br>about storage is that it eats its own<br>lunch you know if you think about it you<br>know<br>bye-bye low sell high or what happens<br>eventually if you buy enough part of low<br>and it's selling off high all of a<br>sudden you have a situation where the<br>price is the same so it actually eats<br>into its own its own market very quickly<br>so this is showing you the system value<br>now if you look at the system value here<br>this is euros per kilowatt of storage<br>capacity and that's per kilowatt right<br>this is dollars you look at these<br>numbers here and you look at the values<br>of storage there the values of storage<br>are you know they do not justify this<br>type of storage you will not be able to<br>buy it for this type of value that you<br>get out of it the reason there's two<br>there is that one is looking at the<br>market value and one is looking at the<br>system value moves up at the incremental<br>but basically what happens<br>storage you know the more and more you<br>put in the system it becomes less<br>valuable very rapidly let's look at<br>emissions one of the things people say<br>this it's really funny people say that<br>storage is a green technology yeah<br>that's a laughable very laughable<br>particularly batteries do you ever see<br>the stuff that goes into batteries yeah<br>where do they make them in countries<br>where it's probably no environmental<br>regulations of any sort and you no idea<br>what damage it's doing to the<br>environment and also batteries are quite<br>intensive in terms of energy that goes<br>into them but even from a system point<br>of view we look to this in the same<br>study that I've showed several graphs<br>from and that shows you that until you<br>get to 11 and a half gigawatts aware now<br>let me be clear about that's 80% energy<br>our system until you get to 11 and a<br>half gigawatts of wind storage and her<br>system is actually damaging for co2 and<br>the reason is very simple because in the<br>case that we did here we're connected to<br>the UK now it depends on which scenario<br>is your run but in this particular case<br>we're connected to the UK and what would<br>happen is is that we have gas a lot of<br>gas and basically what was happening was<br>that cheap coal in the UK was going on<br>at night we were storing it in our<br>storage system and then we're displacing<br>the gas so from a carbon point of view<br>we were displacing gas and replacing the<br>coal new UK<br>ergo co2 was going up and that's just a<br>short-term economics and if people said<br>oh you shouldn't do that I mean it's a<br>classic case of people saying oh you<br>shouldn't do that you have an acid on<br>the system what are you gonna do you're<br>gonna optimize it in the short term and<br>that's what happens and you people say<br>oh you shouldn't do that well you know<br>welcome to the real world the chief<br>scientist of Ireland was one of those<br>people he was there he was a cow chemist<br>and he was trials trying to educate him<br>one day and he said he didn't understand<br>the concept of capital as you have to<br>pay it back so when if people like that<br>you know you can't get anywhere so<br>there's no doubt about it in other<br>systems this is not true but it depends<br>on the fuel mix you have so if the fuel<br>mix was very carbon you know if the fuel<br>mix was different these results are very<br>different but there are cases where<br>storage actually makes carbon dioxide<br>increase not decrease no not all<br>megawatts are created equal so this is a<br>paper given by a guy in<br>Scott Baker yeah so storage is actually<br>working so I've not been you know I've<br>been a little bit negative by storage<br>but storage does work in certain markets<br>so in the PGM market today there are<br>batteries ten megawatt batteries making<br>money in the PGM market and commercial<br>yeah absolutely no problems yeah and the<br>reason is the PGM market has a certain<br>structure at Dadda Dadda Dadda you go to<br>the whole thing<br>it also has a pay performance criteria<br>as well still pay for performance<br>essentially if you look at this you have<br>this is a this is normalized output and<br>this is a traditional control signal and<br>the resource responds they're actually<br>paying for performance batteries can<br>perform much faster or much quicker and<br>in the PGM market they actually pay you<br>for regulation in terms of how fast you<br>can do it and batteries have that<br>capability<br>no other markets don't have that because<br>they don't they don't think they need it<br>and in that case you wouldn't make money<br>so it depends on what the system's<br>asking for and you could argue that one<br>is more reliable the other but it's all<br>you know it's it's a little bit hairy as<br>to what's the best thing to do PGM<br>batteries are in the money making money<br>but they're not making an arbitrage<br>they're making an ancillary services and<br>it's only in PG m and P GM is a very<br>special market and if you want I'll tell<br>you later why it's a very special market<br>but you know so it does make money and<br>then if you look at our friend down here<br>this is Nick Miller again you know so<br>you can those island systems people are<br>so you you you can deploy them you can<br>make money out of them but they're<br>pretty niche to be honest with you so<br>storage play that went wrong so this is<br>that's me in the funny house and this is<br>the opening of beacon power and they<br>were in the ancillary services market<br>tonight just said PJM ancillary services<br>market they're making money and this is<br>a flywheel it's not a battery and beacon<br>power got 50 I think it's 40 or 50<br>million dollars off the US Department of<br>Energy from the same fund that Solyndra<br>was funded from every remember Solyndra<br>Solyndra was this the so-called scandal<br>in the Department of Energy United<br>States were 500 million odd dollars were<br>given to a solar company and it went<br>bust and it was a big you know Obama was<br>in trouble the Republicans are having to<br>go at them they never had to go with<br>this there's only small money 50 minutes<br>but<br>and this got money from the DAO II it's<br>a wonderful engineering technology fly<br>Twitter's a flywheel is an error for<br>engineers flight wheels are really<br>interesting yeah power electronics very<br>fast you know engineers love them but<br>anyway they put flight wheels they<br>actually buried them in the ground<br>the reason they were I think these are<br>all the little silos are like missile<br>silos they're in the ground the reason<br>they're in the ground is because if they<br>if they if the bearings break the thing<br>can yeah if it wasn't in the ground<br>people get killed anyway it's a 20<br>megawatt and provided ancillary services<br>and you say to yourself why does it not<br>making money and the answer is is that<br>first of all it's more expensive<br>technology in the batteries but also<br>when I went to the opening of this in<br>New York I sat down beside a gentleman<br>called Rick Gonzales he's the CTO of New<br>York ISO and he was very surprised to<br>see me first of all because you know I'm<br>from Arlington I ended up in New York<br>the reason I did was because I was up in<br>Cornell for a few weeks and he said to<br>me says what are you doing here it says<br>ray he says and he says to me says these<br>guys are not long for this world and<br>this is why he said and his CEO was<br>given a talk at the time since why and<br>he says when they were building this and<br>in the business case on it regulation<br>was selling at $60 a megawatt hour I<br>mean I said yeah and he says on today<br>well today it's six that was July 11th<br>2011 I started July 11 2011 yeah they<br>lasted from the first of November<br>actually Rick thought they'd make it<br>lowest what he did wrong they made of<br>November they then sold it for $1 yeah<br>and the people are running it now I'm<br>making money<br>why no capital yeah so therefore it's<br>running and it's fine and it's in the<br>market but they have no capital to pay<br>back<br>batteries this is your battery question<br>about this now you know people I'm not<br>I'm not a battery expert and what I know<br>about your experts as they say so this<br>graph was agreed to by an Oxford<br>professor in electrochemistry and MIT<br>professor and various other people so<br>you know people will argue of what the<br>costs really are and this is showing the<br>lithium mine cost trends okay and<br>they're getting lower and lower and<br>lower and lower lower okay<br>but you know the magic number most<br>people accept<br>magic number has to be below 100 and<br>they might by 2030 make it and they<br>won't even make a below 100 but the<br>magic number is around about a hundred<br>once you get below a hundred you started<br>in a situation where it might start<br>making sense and then you go at this<br>situation going off the grid so now you<br>have people who say battery backup power<br>so you put yourself mean anyone who put<br>a small wind turbine in the house is<br>completely insane but that's you know<br>because every knows why no that's so<br>don't worry about that it's a weak it's<br>a V cubed or squared problem yeah<br>velocity velocity cubed and radius<br>squared so therefore big makes a lot of<br>sense the economies of scale and even<br>for big weird turbines wind is still<br>pretty expensive for these things it's<br>incredibly expensive so wind turbines<br>only make economic sense when you make<br>them at scale PV is different because<br>it's justice it's a linear law anyway<br>forget about they they put them in so<br>you generally supplying people putting<br>solar on the roof and then they decide<br>to put some batteries in okay and this<br>is a trend that's happening isn't it<br>they want to go off the grid so to speak<br>okay this is data from Germany and if<br>you look at it it shows the electricity<br>price for households electricity costs<br>for PV electricity costs for PV plus<br>battery and what it appears to say is<br>that there's a point in 2017 in Germany<br>where if you decide to put a PV and<br>battery in your house you're in the<br>money yeah it's cheaper than buying from<br>the grid that's what it says however if<br>you look at this what is the price<br>electricity that's 30 Euro cents yeah<br>won't you you're pretty expensive you're<br>30 New Zealand sentence oh yeah yes<br>you're you yeah you're pretty you're<br>pretty you're pretty expensive guys that<br>have to say but that's just my own<br>comment one of the reasons that this is<br>going up in Germany is why this this<br>price here has the subsidy for the solar<br>in it yeah and the taxes so in fact all<br>that's happening here is interesting is<br>that this money here is subsidizing this<br>gee-ya and what's happening at this<br>point here is that this is a tax<br>avoidance scheme the simple fact the<br>matter is that it makes sense because<br>the the the cost of domestic electricity<br>has so many levies and subsidies you're<br>paying for the PV so here's the case<br>what PV in my roof I buy a battery the<br>both subsidized by my neighbor if he<br>doesn't put PV and Bachchan is roof yeah<br>and it's essentially a tax avoidance<br>scheme for the rich then you get to this<br>thing the so-called spiral of death<br>which is this this gentleman has<br>mentioned it you get the situation where<br>solar PV you put on your roof and you<br>can do with batteries as well and then<br>all of a sudden you know most most<br>networks in the world are paid by a<br>kilowatt hour basis so the network<br>charge is paid in the kilowatt hour<br>basis you're 30 cents or 25 cents or<br>whatever it is here the market price is<br>only 70 isn't it 70 so it's 97 cents so<br>only 1/4 you're more of your domestic<br>bill is paying for the actual wholesale<br>price of energy isn't it the rest is<br>network charges taxes did did it did it<br>so people put solar on the roof right<br>and for whatever reason subsidy or the<br>richer they just want to do it it<br>produces less volume less volume for the<br>network owner means they've got less<br>revenue the network still has to be<br>maintained because most these people are<br>still connected to grid they still need<br>the same amount of investment what<br>happens then is that the utility goes to<br>the regular and says hey I need more<br>cash so the price electricity goes up<br>encourages more people to go off the<br>grid it's a so-called spiral of debt<br>okay and it has to stop because it can't<br>continue because if people say oh well<br>we're going to become independent and<br>the network the network operator is<br>going to become redundant well that's<br>complete nonsense<br>I mean this I'm sorry apologies numbers<br>from Australia what can I say you know<br>you you also the English you and the<br>Australians is that it yeah<br>anyway let's assume they're real I don't<br>know what they'll do but if you look at<br>it you know this is from Sydney this is<br>a network charge for energy this is it<br>if you're off great with 95 percent<br>reliability how many people have 95<br>percent reliability electricity very few<br>it's more like 99.9 percent isn't it so<br>if you go to 99.9 percent you have to<br>buy so much PV and so much<br>batteries to do it that's approximately<br>six times the cost so going off grid is<br>economic suicide so why is it after all<br>I said did Ireland build this pom<br>storage station because we don't have<br>nuclear five minutes so now you're gonna<br>finish we did screwed it's fine<br>we don't have nuclear right we don't<br>have nuclear but we built it and then<br>one of the reasons we built it was<br>because a little bit of storage is a<br>good thing right there's no doubt about<br>it<br>290 megawatts for six hours is a lot<br>right in my opinion humble as it is this<br>was built because a bunch of Engineers<br>who were in the utility owned by state<br>just said to the government gotta build<br>it and the government said sure plenty<br>jobs were created for a long period of<br>time and engineers had great fun digging<br>tunnels and building a great piece of<br>engineering and that is one of the<br>reasons that that was built so if it was<br>a 50 megawatt to our job of probably<br>would have been enough for us because a<br>little bit of storage is a good thing I<br>think they probably went over the top<br>here consumer in demand management's I'm<br>talking about the consumer now I'm not<br>talking about big like there's no doubt<br>about it big you know smelters and big<br>companies could do demand side response<br>and it's a very valuable thing to do<br>when they get paid for it but there is<br>talk that the consumer will be this is<br>the talk that says every consumer will<br>be flexible this is the sort of thing<br>I'm trying to talk about so its consumer<br>demand response let's just take this<br>this these are terminal storage heaters<br>this is the grid this is a project that<br>we're involved in these are electric<br>thermal storage heaters if you look at<br>the capacity value of this so the<br>capacity value before I mentioned is if<br>I put something in if I put one megawatt<br>or something in and it's got a posse<br>value of 0.8 it means I can serve point<br>eight of megawatt of load across the<br>entire year maintain the same level<br>reliability a system that's the capacity<br>value you put in thermal storage heating<br>you can shift load yeah therefore you<br>you're shifting away from the peak<br>therefore you should be able to supply<br>more demand over the whole year and<br>still maintain the same level<br>reliability agreed so you put this in<br>okay and you say to yourself what's its<br>capacity value now one of the things is<br>about thermal storage heating or any<br>use of consumer electricity is the<br>consumer is consuming a service yeah and<br>that service is to keep you warm keep<br>your cold cook your toasty or whatever<br>okay the consumer has requirements so<br>you must obey those requirements so if<br>you have to obey those requirements as a<br>constraint okay you have to take that<br>into account a lot of people have done<br>the calculations on this and just said I<br>can do it and I want to this you can't<br>the consumer has to actually you know<br>get their level of comfort etc second<br>thing is if you look at in terms of<br>short-term member I mentioned about the<br>storage device once you put it in you<br>operate it on a short-term you know you<br>build it for one reason but you operate<br>in a short-term basis if you're<br>operating a short-term basis the system<br>marginal price of the price whatever and<br>reliability yeah they're correlated high<br>prices you know are usually assists are<br>cases where the adequacy is low<br>eccentric but not always<br>therefore what's happening here it's<br>shifting it but it's not always shifting<br>in a way that's helping reliability and<br>then if you take the base case which are<br>comparing or to if you just had done<br>storage okay the end of the situation we<br>have a capacity value that's quite low<br>the point is is that these devices the<br>consumer has constraints the system has<br>constraints and when you do the numbers<br>on it the capacity value is actually<br>quite low then you have to a great them<br>together do all the messing around with<br>dealing with Miller well what's the<br>worst what's the you talk to anyone it's<br>much better off to sell a one hundred<br>million dollar piece of equipment to one<br>person than it is to try and sell 1<br>million $100 piece of equipment in fact<br>it's cost twice as much so making money<br>is all about selling it to one person at<br>scale dealing with customers it's a<br>nightmare how many of you here do you<br>deal with customers yeah they don't pay<br>they don't do this they don't do that so<br>it's very expensive to do it so did a<br>man side in terms of what it can produce<br>is actually quite low and if you look at<br>other work so this is these are two<br>papers I'll leave these slides if you<br>look at other work that's been done<br>around the world this is not always the<br>case but generally is true and I'm<br>talking about customers I'm not talking<br>about you and me and you know small and<br>not talking about big aluminium smelters<br>if you look at it you say I give control<br>of my entire load over to the sector or<br>whoever yeah<br>you give it to them they might they<br>might get by a two pints of beer a<br>mountain as a reward that's roughly how<br>much you get you know I give total<br>control to utility two pints of beer<br>that's Guinness that's good beer<br>you know that's ten quid that's about<br>$15 scale it up 161 say that's the type<br>of money people get for to total control<br>most of you say I'm not giving the<br>control of my electricity for two points<br>of beer a month I'm just not going to do<br>it so there's just not enough money if<br>there's no business case at all if you<br>look at this then you look as people say<br>market and policy barriers there's no<br>doubt about it that if you look at the<br>demand side there are bar barriers to it<br>there's absolutely no doubt about it<br>that there are rules and regulations<br>that stop it from happening right but if<br>you were to remove them the two pints of<br>beer is still the ultimate barrier okay<br>and there's no doubt about it people<br>have said these barriers and that's why<br>it's not working I guarantee you when<br>you remove all the barriers it won't<br>work because two pints of beer is not<br>enough and also when you find people and<br>say the business model isn't there I<br>usually say you mean the subsidies not<br>there no you'd be careful of people who<br>say business models because generally<br>what they're saying is I want a subsidy<br>demand-side in Ireland this is the<br>growth of demand-side in Ireland so I've<br>just contradicted myself look at it it's<br>dramatic isn't it now these are<br>generally speaking commercial people but<br>nonetheless it's growing dramatically<br>the reason is very simple we have a<br>capacity market yeah pay for capacity we<br>had an economic crash the capacity<br>market was designed to attract capacity<br>and I didn't think about getting rid of<br>capacity and all of a sudden to the man<br>side realized if I even responsive I'll<br>never be caught because as bungles of<br>capacity but shall I get some money this<br>is a complete and utter fraud that's<br>what it is<br>not not one of these everyone asked for<br>called so I finish on this one this is<br>my view of the future okay dad designed<br>a demand-side to be flexible so where is<br>so the demand side is is definitely<br>worth looking at because it's not an<br>extra capital expense right it's not<br>like storage you don't have to buy it<br>it's not an additional additional<br>capital cost<br>but the problem with it is is that<br>customer is very inflexible and that's<br>the basic problem you have this is wind<br>and load over a year 2010 scaled up on a<br>monthly basis so as the wind is equal to<br>the load now if you were going to supply<br>this is a case for a monthly basis but<br>you can do it for hourly yearly whatever<br>you want you think for one minute that<br>the demand side is going to be able to<br>help this in other words am I going to<br>be able to charge of my electric car<br>during the winter and drive it all<br>summer no you're not it's not going to<br>happen did a man side can't actually<br>address the fundamental problems we have<br>but if you design society around the<br>concept that you need to look like this<br>so one of the reasons that you so take<br>the water system the water system is an<br>incredible pumping water is an<br>incredibly potentially flexible thing to<br>do if you designed a water system in a<br>way that you are expecting this type of<br>future then the demand side becomes<br>extremely valuable in other words you<br>don't design it just service a customer<br>you designed a service a customer and to<br>be flexible at the start then the demand<br>side can make a lot of sense but at the<br>moment it was designed to serve you and<br>I as a customer it wasn't designed to<br>produce your services to the grid so<br>demand side is incredibly important but<br>it's at a planning stage it's not at the<br>sort of operational stage I think I<br>better stop there because I'm going to<br>get in trouble so this is it and I can't<br>read those so storage in demand<br>management many potential roles in<br>electricity to hold dedicated storage is<br>expensive and unless someone brings it<br>down by a factor of two or three it's<br>not and they might they might it might<br>happen not saying it won't happen and<br>it's declining in cost but you know will<br>it declined fast enough and the problem<br>with the demand side is on the consumer<br>side is that the consumer has<br>constraints and you need to get rid of<br>those to enable it the value proposition<br>to consume is very low the two pints of<br>beer and then design this system from<br>the very start is actually the key to<br>the man side actually design the entire<br>ad tired so have factories that during<br>times of energy that's free or<br>ubiquitous you generate a certain<br>product that requires a lot of energy<br>but the same factory can generate a<br>product that requires less<br>things like that sort of planning<br>thinking about it in advance it is<br>related to where wind but it's not<br>fundamentally related to great research<br>topic and sound scientific vie for<br>policymaker so this is one year<br>politicians do you recognize her no she<br>want to get our profile open if she<br>wants to be a minister in an<br>ex-government her name is what's her<br>name megan woods she from christchurch<br>who met her yesterday anyway nice lady<br>but she immediately said what about<br>batteries so you need to maybe go down<br>there and give her a little bit of<br>education okay so there you go this is a<br>acknowledgement to these people this<br>says what karev me and mahogany means<br>thank you very much in
