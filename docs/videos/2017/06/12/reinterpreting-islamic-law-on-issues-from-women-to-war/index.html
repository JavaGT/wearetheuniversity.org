good evening ladies and<br>gentlemen for those of you who don't<br>know me my name is Paul Heath I am the<br>president of the legal research<br>foundation it's our great pleasure to<br>introduce tonight our visiting scholar<br>professor Raj Bala to speak to you<br>professor Bala has been in the country<br>for some time and is undertaking an<br>extraordinary amount of work for us as<br>visiting scholar and we'd like to thank<br>you very much for that professor<br>professor Bala is the associate dean for<br>international and comparative law and<br>the rice distinguished professor at the<br>University of Kansas School of Law he<br>practiced at the Federal Reserve Bank of<br>New York where he twice won the<br>President's Award for Excellence thanks<br>to his service as a delegate to the<br>United Nations I think it's Commission<br>on international trade law at UNCITRAL<br>a Harvard Law School graduate he<br>completed master's degrees at the London<br>School of Economics and Oxford as a<br>Marshall scholar and an undergraduate<br>degree at Duke as an engineer be jook<br>scholar he is the author of a leading<br>textbook in international trade law the<br>first treatise on GATT in nearly 50<br>years and a new book on TPP is the first<br>non-muslim American scholar to write a<br>textbook on Islamic law I'm told he<br>likes visiting New Zealand which is nice<br>because it is very good to have you here<br>professor Bayless topic tonight is<br>reinterpreting Islamic law from women to<br>war and I would invite you to welcome<br>professor Baylor tonight<br>bismillah r-rahman here Rahim Salam<br>alaikum but I just said bismillahi<br>r-rahman r-rahim means in the name of<br>Allah the most merciful the most<br>compassionate and then I said peace to<br>all of you in a standard Islamic setting<br>starting any presentation or for that<br>many mattr any written work with the<br>bismillah would be very customary and<br>starting with Salaam alaikum peace be<br>with you would also be very standard and<br>it is fine for non-muslims in fact it's<br>a nice diplomatic gesture in most<br>countries to start that way the<br>bismillah happens to be the very first<br>recitation that Allah sent through the<br>Archangel Gabriel or gibreel the same<br>Archangel who was at the Annunciation of<br>Mary - the Prophet Muhammad peace be<br>upon him in 610 ad and the bismillah is<br>in surah or chapter 99 of the holy quran<br>you've noticed I just used the prefix<br>Holy Quran as we would with Holy Bible<br>and the suffix pbuh peace be upon him<br>after mentioning the prophet mohammed<br>and here and after please know that i<br>mean to use that prefix and suffix<br>whenever I return refer to the Quran or<br>the Prophet but I'll drop it just for<br>efficiency sake I'm very delighted to be<br>back in this lovely country with my<br>family our daughter Shira and my wife<br>Cara and to see my dear and dearest old<br>friend and law school classmate Scot<br>opticon I'm extraordinarily indebted to<br>the legal research foundation - your<br>honor - Craig<br>to see on to Anita they've just worked<br>so hard to bring us here and we I think<br>we have about a thousand emails and<br>Counting but it's all coming to to pass<br>now since I've come here it's been a<br>delight to give not only a course in<br>international trade law but seven but<br>also seven presentations public<br>presentations including two interviews<br>and they've all been important not for<br>reasons of the speaker not for reasons<br>of me but because of the topics in fact<br>two of the topics last week on the<br>trans-pacific partnership and on<br>international trade law we're really at<br>bottom about wealth and poverty but this<br>presentation is the most important since<br>I've come to this beautiful country at<br>least 40 people have been killed in<br>Manchester London and Tehran and that's<br>not counting other parts of the world<br>and they've been killed in the name of<br>Islam or Islamist terrorism or Islamic<br>violence and if nothing else you<br>remember after tonight's presentation<br>remember this all of those killings were<br>utterly unlock and I'm going to try and<br>show you why we are all searching from<br>Washington to Wellington and Albany to<br>Auckland how do we defeat terrorism in<br>the name of religion when President<br>Kennedy set up or formalized the u.s.<br>special operations forces under the<br>foreign assistance act of 1961 he made<br>sure that it was understood there were<br>three pillars two special ops one is of<br>course defense military the guns stuff<br>but there were two others one is<br>engagement engagement with the local<br>population understanding<br>culture the language the religion and<br>the second was development economic<br>development wells water wells literacy<br>programs and I can tell you and this is<br>the key theme of tonight there is no<br>military solution there's no military<br>solution to defeating extremism in the<br>name in the perverted name should say of<br>Islam the battle we are in is an<br>education battle and we lawyers we're at<br>the frontlines right there with the<br>special ops not in the military sense<br>but in helping move Muslim communities<br>around the world to reinterpret their<br>sacred texts and their sacred sources<br>and that's an odd position for us to be<br>in because most of us are not Muslim and<br>we're very cognizant of the dark history<br>in which the non-muslim world engaged<br>with the Muslim world the Crusades and<br>yet it's that external impulse that<br>we're trying to deliver peacefully to<br>catalyze what is nothing short of an<br>Enlightenment across the Muslim world<br>that's the education battle we're in and<br>so what I hope tonight to explain to you<br>is exactly what some of the intellectual<br>weapons or that we need to reinterpret<br>some of the most controversial topics in<br>Islamic law another way for those of us<br>who like treaty interpretation and<br>statutory interpretation is to<br>understand tonight's presentation as<br>addressing the simple issue how do we<br>interpret legal texts that's that's sort<br>of what we're getting at so it's a<br>common problem across sacred legal<br>systems and secular legal systems also<br>the first step for the first weapon in<br>this intellectual battle is to<br>understand where Islamic law or what we<br>commonly know as the Sharia comes from<br>now the Sharia or the word Sharia means<br>Islamic law there is no need to say<br>Sharia law it's like saying New Zealand<br>law law it's redundant Sharia includes<br>the term law and it is understood as a<br>path initially in the old Arabic in<br>pre-islamic times it meant a path as a<br>path in the desert where a camel might<br>be led for example to an oasis a<br>watering hole but it later took on a<br>meeting that Daoists are very familiar<br>with the DAO an all-encompassing way of<br>life and Sharia or Islamic law is indeed<br>an all-encompassing way of life how we<br>each deal with each other in our homes<br>in our bedrooms in the public square<br>with the government in all aspects of<br>life and we care about how we deal with<br>each other because God has intervened in<br>human history to give us a sacred<br>scripture the Holy Quran and God has<br>told us in that Sacred Scripture that<br>there is a day of judgment what<br>Christians know as particularly and<br>final judgment in the Muslim theology<br>both judgments exist at the end of time<br>final judgment upon death particular<br>judgment and we stand alone before God<br>with no intercessory agent and we are<br>called to account for what we've done<br>and what we what we're going to be<br>judged on in Muslim theology is not how<br>successful we were in doing everything<br>right but how hard we tried Islam itself<br>the word means submission submission<br>submission to what submission to the<br>will of Allah so how do we follow a path<br>to submit to the will of Allah<br>well we use the sources of law of Sharia<br>that he has given us and he's given us<br>two fundamental sources the first is the<br>Holy Quran and the second is the Sunna<br>now the Holy Quran was revealed to the<br>Prophet Muhammad as I mentioned through<br>the Archangel gibreel across 22 years<br>from 610 ad to 632 ad the year the<br>Prophet died and during those years he<br>would feel a sense of something that<br>would call him out to the desert around<br>Mecca and Medina after 621 when he<br>migrated to Medina or the 622 he would<br>feel that sense of something that would<br>call him out and he would get<br>revelations and the revelations the<br>first one the bismallah were put into<br>his heart in a way that he could not<br>possibly forget because he by tradition<br>was illiterate he did not know how to<br>read and write but they were thrust into<br>his heart in such a way that his mind<br>could not forget and at the end of his<br>life he was asked by gibreel to re<br>recite the entire Quran from beginning<br>to end twice so the 633 606 thousand<br>three hundred verses we get which<br>subsequently were put into a hundred and<br>fourteen chapters were checked each year<br>of his life and double-checked at the<br>end of his life they were it's a<br>fascinating story which maybe we can<br>talk about in the question and answer<br>it's how we actually got a written<br>canonical text of the Quran it came at<br>652 during the the first Caliphate it's<br>a very very interesting story if you<br>will Quranic archaeology but we'll take<br>that as a given<br>so the key point on this first source is<br>that these are reliable and they were<br>heard in fact the very first that<br>bismillah was heard by none other than<br>his beloved wife Khadija with whom he<br>enjoyed a monogamous relationship and<br>they had children they were married in<br>595 ad she died in 6 1980 it was the<br>terrible blow personally for him and she<br>could have said to him when he came back<br>in 610 ad from the first revelation she<br>could have said to him you were out in<br>the desert it's hot you're dehydrated<br>you need electrolytes she didn't say<br>that she said you have received an<br>authentic revelation from God and just a<br>double check she took him to their<br>cousin waraqa waraqa said the same thing<br>you've received an authentic revelation<br>from God and Warrick is important<br>because waraqa was a Christian in fact<br>women and Christians play an<br>indispensable positive role in the birth<br>of this faith without them it could have<br>easily been snuffed out and that's<br>something right away you can see that<br>extremists don't know or if they know<br>they deliberately suppress now if a<br>question is answered by the Holy Quran<br>then that's it there is no appeal and<br>generally speaking questions a lot of<br>time is spent and we're going to spend<br>some time on the three questions I<br>mentioned up there on the board on how<br>you interpret the Quran it's just like<br>there's whole schools of thought of<br>biblical interpretation treaty<br>interpretation statutory interpretation<br>and literary interpretation so also<br>there is of current er predation we<br>sometimes think in the United States<br>that we developed schools of<br>interpretation or if we didn't British<br>sit a thousand years before then it<br>what's happening in Quranic schools in<br>Basra and Kufa and Mecca and Medina and<br>actually much of the debt in this we<br>have much to pay in terms of debt to<br>that what those ways of interpreting so<br>we'll talk about a Quranic<br>interpretation in a minute the second<br>top source is the tradition of the<br>Prophet Sunnah means tradition son that<br>means tradition and the tradition of the<br>Prophet is recorded in multi-volume<br>compilations seven or eight volumes per<br>compiler known as the hadith now these<br>hadith are the non prophetic utterances<br>of Muhammad things he said things he<br>didn't say things he did things he<br>didn't do that are recorded between<br>roughly 700 750 ad to about 950 AD after<br>he died there was a huge amount of<br>effort by Muslim scholars to record all<br>of his non prophetic utterances he and<br>him he himself in his life being a very<br>humble person told all of his Sahaba<br>companions don't focus on what I am<br>saying focus instead on the message that<br>has been revealed to me now of course<br>like any sacred text it's not a<br>comprehensive statutory code there are a<br>lot of general principles and then there<br>are some specific rules for example the<br>rule that we need two witnesses for a<br>contract that's going to be in the Quran<br>but on the other hand what about the<br>question of whether or not during the<br>holy month of Ramadan which we are<br>currently in is it alright for women to<br>go to a mosque pitch a tent stay<br>overnight<br>the tent so that they can worship 24/7<br>that's not a question answered in the<br>car on so devotees went to him and said<br>can we do this and he said yes so<br>there's the source of the rule that<br>second source the Sunnah as recorded in<br>the hadith now hadith scholarship like<br>Quranic scholarship is itself a massive<br>area in fact depending on the<br>compilation of the deeds and there's<br>seven major one seven or eight major<br>ones the there are about between six<br>seven thousand and fifteen thousand in<br>fact one even has 22,000 different<br>specific statements than Muhammad said<br>on top of what's in the car and Muslim<br>scholars carefully evaluate each<br>statement for their reliability and they<br>evaluate the reliability according to<br>what we know in evidence law as the<br>chain of transmission it's not if a if<br>Prophet Muhammad said to a said to be<br>then said to see then said to be a<br>statement and that chain of transmission<br>crosses many many years and many many<br>transmitters and some of those<br>transmitters are not reliable or not of<br>good moral character not idle then the<br>hadith statement is not so reliable kind<br>of like having a drug dealer up on the<br>witness stand but on the other hand if<br>we have few transmitters and each one is<br>a sterling individual based on our<br>historical knowledge of their biography<br>then the hadith is reliable so when it<br>is said that a suicide bomber awaiting<br>him or her in heaven are ninety-nine<br>virgins that's not a reliable hadith<br>it's not in the Quran despite what right<br>wing fanatics in the United States would<br>have you believe it's not in the Quran<br>and in the hadith compilation that it's<br>in it's in one of the less well-regarded<br>compilers and it's not a reliable hadith<br>in fact the two most reliable hadith<br>compilations are by al-bukhari and sahi<br>Muslim and you can buy an excellent<br>translation of the Quran and Bukhari and<br>Muslim right off Amazon and you can<br>start stalking your Islamic law Islamic<br>finance library for two or three hundred<br>u.s. or less and they're beautiful<br>usually leather-bound copies so that's<br>our second major source if we get a<br>question answered by one or two that's<br>it case over notice these sources are<br>called fundamental contrary to what you<br>hear in the media and again from<br>right-wing extremists the word<br>fundamentalist is properly used in the<br>context of saying a person who wants to<br>return to the fundamentals of the faith<br>meaning the fundamental sources of the<br>faith they want to rely on just these<br>two and the fundamentalist project in<br>Islamic law is to try and avoid reliance<br>on these additional sources that we'll<br>talk about in a minute why to maintain<br>the purity of the Sharia well what's the<br>worry about maintaining the purity well<br>let me give you both a religious and a<br>secular example one way to explain why<br>to the extent our very imperfect limited<br>human minds can understand why God<br>revealed the Quran is because twice<br>before we strayed the Old Testament was<br>revealed and the old test<br>and profits all of whom are acknowledged<br>in Islamic theology they followed Old<br>Testament rules for a while but by the<br>time the Ten Commandments or shortly<br>thereafter<br>people started strength they started<br>violating the Ten Commandments they were<br>killing each other they were committing<br>adultery so then God in His infinite<br>mercy gave us the New Testament giving<br>Christ two great Commandments love God<br>with all your heart mind and soul and<br>love your neighbor like yourself but<br>then Christians started strength they<br>ward with each other<br>there were schisms so then God again in<br>his instance mercy gave the final<br>revelation with the final seal of the<br>Prophet and that is the holy quran so<br>that's sort of one explanation the other<br>explanation why we want to maintain the<br>purity and not stray from the line with<br>adding an additional ways of thinking<br>comes from our own US Constitution oh my<br>gosh you can burn the flag oh my gosh<br>corporations can give unlimited campaign<br>contributions to political action<br>committees oh my gosh you can carry<br>concealed weapons into a university<br>classroom is that what the first and<br>second amendment means who's coming up<br>with this we're straying from the<br>fundamental sources and if you're<br>thinking Justice Scalia that's the right<br>thought but if you're thinking he came<br>up with it that's the wrong thought even<br>tamiya the tradition estate tradition<br>Asst back in a thousand 80 1200 AD we're<br>focusing on the fundamentals so<br>fundamentalist need should not be<br>conflated with violent crazy nutjob<br>extremists that's that's not the right<br>meaning it actually isn't a deep<br>intellectual project to make sure the<br>children of Abraham don't stray again<br>because God gave it to us one last time<br>this<br>revelation but still sometimes<br>especially is the ages roll on and<br>technology gets enhanced we have new<br>questions we need to think about and so<br>there's a third or secondary sources<br>there are third and fourth sources to<br>look at the source of three and four<br>they're secondary sources we only go to<br>them if we don't go to the fundament<br>can't resolve the question and here's an<br>example can a Muslim travel by airplane<br>well that's definitely not in the Quran<br>it's definitely not an idiot there were<br>no airplanes around now let me give you<br>some answers with reasons and answer<br>with reason and then let me give you<br>which is the right reason okay<br>first answer yes a Muslim can travel by<br>an airplane because that will help<br>stimulate the economy because we'll use<br>I'm poking a little bit of fun here<br>Kotter Airways or Emirates or Saudi<br>arrows so will generate more business<br>more travel that's an economic<br>justification let me give you a public<br>interest justification yes a Muslim can<br>travel by an airplane comma because we<br>can then support the state airline again<br>Cotter Emirates or Satya third reason<br>yes a Muslim can travel by an airplane<br>comma because then the Muslim can<br>reunite with his or her family that's a<br>human right sort of family oriented<br>justification all three answers are<br>right but for the wrong reason the right<br>answer with the right reason is this a<br>Muslim can travel by an airplane because<br>an airplane is analogous to the common<br>modes of transport during the time of<br>the Prophet Mohammed 610 to 632 ad<br>and those modes were camel caravan and<br>horseback analogy analogy you can get<br>the right answer<br>but you have to get the right reason to<br>now why do we constrain why do Islamic<br>legal scholars constrain the mode of<br>legal reasoning why do we focus on<br>reasoning by analogy again the influence<br>of the tradition astute rye and stay on<br>the straight path and that is another<br>secondary name for Islam it's the<br>straight path towards God to that day of<br>judgment if we start talking about<br>economic reasoning or public interest<br>reasoning or human rights reasoning well<br>then any crazy law professor like me can<br>come up with some spiffy Law Review<br>article and give you a reason to do it<br>ah we don't want that to happen that's<br>what's happened to the US Constitution<br>right this is the thinking right in in<br>in al-azhar university or international<br>islamic law university so kiosks is<br>specifically reasoning by analogy now<br>our fourth source of Islamic law if we<br>still don't have we're still debating<br>what's the right analogy and we can<br>debate a lot about analogies for example<br>would you say a Muslim can travel by<br>rocket ship because now you're going out<br>of space are you going to into outer<br>space you're going to debate the rocket<br>shippers of the airplane analogy back to<br>the horse-drawn horse or a camel caravan<br>then we have Muslim scholars sitting<br>together in a Quranic school<br>men and they're debating and trying to<br>reach a consensus so for example is it<br>permissible for a woman to have an<br>abortion if so under what conditions and<br>if so until what day and the pregnancy<br>there is no universal consensus across<br>the Sharia on this question different<br>Islamic schools have different<br>consensuses and the short answer is 42<br>days or 120 days on the time limit 42<br>days say some because that's the day in<br>which God implants a soul insolvent<br>something that the early Christian<br>fathers debated and gave up on insolvent<br>into the human soul right into the<br>fertilized egg others say a hundred and<br>twenty days and so schools of Islamic<br>law can have reach a consensus and they<br>can have dissents within the consensus<br>and different schools can add different<br>consensus and likewise on the conditions<br>for an abortion that depends on the<br>school and what consensus it's reached<br>some say life of the mother some will<br>say psychological health of the mother<br>as well as life depends some will also<br>debate whether or not it must be a<br>Muslim doctor who does the abortion now<br>these decisions in terms of analogical<br>reasoning and consensus are recorded in<br>treatises Muslim scholars love treatise<br>writing and and and so they have many<br>may treatise on evidence treatise on<br>family law treatise on human jinn on<br>euthanasia many of them typically are in<br>Arabic but more and more becoming<br>translated and I say that love for<br>treatise writing because it's somewhat<br>of a lost art in the US legal Academy<br>which is the great shame the project in<br>the Muslim legal mind of trying to put<br>together a field of law and get it down<br>and handed down hand down that Canon is<br>still really admired in a way that's not<br>in some other legal academies normally<br>all of our questions are going to be<br>answered if we go through to these four<br>sources now I should pause and point out<br>that<br>as you probably know and we'll get a<br>chance maybe in the question answers<br>there are two great denominations in<br>Islam Sunni and Shiah about 80 to 85% of<br>the world's 1.5 billion Muslims are<br>Sunni about 15 to 20 percent are Shia<br>within the Sunni world there are four<br>major schools of islamic law and they<br>have their own as I said majority and<br>minority splits and within the shield<br>world there are three major divisions<br>Twelver in iran sevinor and fiber so<br>what I'm going to talk about when we do<br>this is basically cutting across all of<br>the divisions and saying this is<br>generally applicable to all of them<br>there are some deviations but we can<br>maybe talk about those later<br>and I'm going to talk about one though<br>now what happens if you don't get into<br>you don't get a resolution using these<br>four sources of Islamic law then through<br>the ages additional ways of interpreting<br>and reading texts have come into play<br>one of them is Public Interest reasoning<br>I mentioned that known as Muslim but<br>this is the big one this is how we<br>battle extremists HD HOD HD HOD is it is<br>a name that all a word an Arabic word<br>that all Americans should be a lot more<br>familiar with they tend to know she had<br>but they don't know what jihad means<br>they think it means suicide bombing<br>actually it means struggle and in fact<br>that's from the soul because one person<br>went up to Muhammad one day and said<br>what's the best form of jihad and he<br>said you know what the best form of<br>jihad is a word a word of truth to an<br>unjust ruler not a bomb not a sword a<br>word okay<br>they tend to not know what she had means<br>and they don't know this keyword is she<br>hot now why is that word so important<br>that's independent reasoning that's<br>where what all of us in the English<br>common law tradition are used to<br>bringing in law and economics bringing<br>in human rights bringing in Public<br>Interest reasoning to come to a<br>conclusion now amazingly around about<br>950 ad tonight legal scholars the ones<br>in the four major sue night schools said<br>you know what it's been about 350 400<br>years since the Prophet died we're<br>worried about straying from the straight<br>path we're in the obviously caliphate<br>now to Baghdad some strange ideas are<br>coming out we are worried about those<br>flag burning and second amendment type<br>problems so we are closing the gate to<br>issue god this is like law professors<br>saying you cannot reason independently<br>anymore it's known as the closing of the<br>gate or closing of the door is jihad you<br>must just use these four top sources and<br>preferably these two and even Tamiya was<br>one of the great tradition ASET yep<br>let's close up data API even though he<br>sometimes said it needs to be reopened<br>but we'll come to that and instead of<br>using our own independent legal<br>reasoning we must follow the greats that<br>preceded us the great scholars had<br>preceded us this is almost like saying<br>the new justice Gorsuch thing I can't<br>use my mind the only thing I can do is<br>apply what justice Marshall or Justice<br>Douglas said I just have to I'm just I'm<br>just mechanically following same idea we<br>see today back then the problem with the<br>closing of the gate to issue<br>is it has resulted in the ossification<br>of the legal system that is to say it's<br>become more and more rigid as it forces<br>up decisions to these first two sources<br>and that's what I want to give you in<br>the three examples that are so<br>controversial<br>so the reopening project HD hot is some<br>Muslim reformist talk about is so vital<br>okay and again think of a United States<br>special operations forces woman or man<br>in a village in Afghanistan literacy<br>rate fifty percent if you're lucky<br>thirty percent for girls one copy of the<br>Holy Quran in the hands of an old guy<br>who held been sure he knows how to<br>interpret it and that special op has to<br>say you know HDI would be a great idea<br>that's what our guys have to do that's<br>why guys have to do and they know it all<br>right so let's start with some examples<br>of reinterpreting Islamic law the first<br>one can a Muslim beat his wife so Sora<br>means chapter ayah means verse with a<br>key it's plural<br>so you could say Surat as well and we<br>have in chapter 4 surah 4 ayah 34 so you<br>can go home and look these up the<br>following passage and you'll see it has<br>three sentences the third one is the key<br>one husband's should take full care of<br>their wives with the bounties God has<br>given - some more than others and with<br>what they spend out of their own money<br>righteous wives are devout and guard<br>what God would have them guard in their<br>husband's absence third sentence if you<br>that's the husband<br>fear high-handedness from your wives<br>remind them of the teaching of God then<br>ignore them when you go to bed and then<br>hit them so a three-fold graded<br>punishment if the husband fears<br>high-handedness from your lives remind<br>them of the teachings of God then ignore<br>them when you go to bed then hit them<br>and then if they obey you you have no<br>right to act against them now tragically<br>through the ages and I certainly don't<br>want to say domestic violence is limited<br>to Muslim communities because it's<br>absolutely not but tragically through<br>the ages many Muslim women have suffered<br>domestic violence if you look at other<br>translations that is the one from Abdul<br>Halim by Oxford University Press but if<br>you look at all of them and you look at<br>the key words it doesn't get any better<br>for example here's one from a JR brewery<br>in 1955 if you fear they may be<br>rebellious admonish them banish them to<br>their couches and beat them then you get<br>the same translation from Professor<br>Maajid Fakhri in DC in 2002 and the<br>meaning of the glorious quran in 1919<br>the first english scholar translated the<br>quran Marmaduke Pickthall men are in<br>charge of women because all I have made<br>them one of them to excel the other and<br>because they spend of their property to<br>support women so good women are obedient<br>as for those whom you fear rebellion<br>admonish them banish them to their beds<br>and scourge them if you literally know<br>what scourge means from Lent and the<br>Stations of the Cross it's pretty nasty<br>now you do get Muslim scholars trying to<br>take the rougher edge off of the verb<br>beat here<br>scourge some of them say for example<br>that what's really going on is a tapping<br>on the woman's wrist as if by a<br>toothbrush others say it's like taking a<br>scarf and just tapping like that but we<br>know as lawyers<br>that's not much protection for a woman<br>because that kind of tapping quickly<br>falls down the slippery slope to serious<br>violence and even death so we need<br>something better and moreover what is<br>that trigger event anyway high<br>handedness really mean well the high<br>hand in this verb in Arabic is misused<br>and the verb that is translated I should<br>say the adjective the high end and the<br>verb beat or hit is durable along comes<br>a woman in 2009 who I learned about in<br>Lawrence Kansas my daughter went to<br>Montessori School with their kids and<br>she had come from Iran and she said oh<br>you're writing this book about Islamic<br>law have you heard about this new<br>translation of the Quran by dr. Lally<br>Bakhtiar and it's called the sublime<br>Quran so I said no I'm not heard of this<br>we're talking in the parking lot<br>dropping our kids off at school having<br>this conversation about this crop great<br>since sublime Quran said let's get it so<br>I get off Amazon and here's how Lally<br>Bakhtiar translates for 34 men are<br>supporters of wives now what we had<br>earlier was husbands should take full<br>care of their wives there is a clear<br>difference one is more paternalistic one<br>is more partnership men are supporters<br>of their wives because God has given<br>some of them<br>advantage over others that is some men<br>are wealthier than others and because<br>they spend of their wealth and then<br>where it has traditionally said that<br>righteous wives are devout and guard<br>what they should guard in the husband's<br>absence<br>it says the ones in accord with morality<br>are the ones who are morally obligated<br>and the ones who guard the unseen of<br>what God has kept safe we've changed the<br>pronoun it's not that the met the women<br>have to behave a certain way it's both<br>men and women and now this all-important<br>third sentence directed at men the<br>husband and those that is the women<br>whose resistance you fear not<br>disobedience not high hands those<br>resistance here's what it says then<br>admonish them and abandon them in their<br>sleeping places and go away from them go<br>away from them not beat hit scourge but<br>go away now how does lolly Bakhtiar<br>change<br>she doesn't this is the first and one of<br>the coolest examples of reinterpreting<br>Islamic law we know that as lawyers one<br>of the best things to do is hang the<br>other side with its own words she<br>doesn't even use ich Nihad to get to<br>this interpretation what she does if she<br>looks at in particular that verb dhaba<br>and she goes back doing a lexical<br>historical lexicographic analysis of<br>what Derrida meant between 610 and 632<br>ad when the revelations came to the<br>Prophet and guess what it meant stamp or<br>stop with one's foot beat or strike site<br>as an example or a dispute<br>asked throwout fling upon the ground in<br>gender turn about make a sign or point<br>with the hand prohibit prevent seek<br>glory avoid or shun or leave turn away<br>oneself to be with shame be in a state<br>of commotion be in a state between hope<br>and fear and finally to go away so we<br>have basically about twenty different<br>meanings of the verb Darla it is an<br>inherently ambiguous verb as of the time<br>of the revelation how do we know then if<br>we have multiple definitions of the key<br>Quranic verb how do we know which one to<br>pick<br>ah let's go to the Sunna number two is<br>there anything in the hadith anything at<br>all that suggests Mohammed beat his<br>wives no there's more extensive analysis<br>of what the Prophet said and of his<br>biography then there is even of Jesus<br>that's a historical fact and there is<br>nothing in any of that called any of<br>those compilations that suggests<br>Mohammed beat his wife to the contrary<br>he was a loving husband and father and<br>grandfather used to love to put his kids<br>up on his shoulders play with them so if<br>we have multiple meanings of a verb dr.<br>Bakhtiar says which one do we pick pick<br>the one that is most in the chord with<br>the Sunna why did we pick he'd beat or<br>hit or scourge the guys picked it the<br>guys picked it and they stuck with it<br>until she came along so what's the<br>response to this translation this 2009<br>translation she's a woman<br>and she's a Shiite she's an American<br>raised to the Christian went to Tehran<br>fell in love with Farsi and Arabic<br>studied it got her PhD and translated<br>well who is she<br>well I taste you've got a lot more<br>credentials than Osama bin Laden ever<br>had or al-baghdadi or any of those Isis<br>or al-qaeda leaders they're not scholars<br>but what they do is they argue ad<br>hominem against the woman<br>very classic move we see them all<br>faculty meeting sometimes too so I can't<br>just point the pig all right that's the<br>first exam second example must a woman<br>wear a veil this is the passage in the<br>Holy Quran known as the descent of the<br>head job now burka bands let's be clear<br>the job is just generally means veil<br>burka is head to foot and no face the<br>face is covered entirely and it most it<br>might have a grill like you see in the<br>Taliban Afghanistan a grill for the<br>woman to look through the next most<br>restrictive is the NIC Cobb and that has<br>the slit for the eyes when my wife and<br>daughter came to Saudi Arabia daughter<br>was below the age of having to wear the<br>abaya wife wore life or but didn't need<br>to wear the headscarf because they were<br>very nice to foreigners right so and and<br>you've noticed that when Melania went<br>she didn't have to wear anything I mean<br>nobody really oh so where do we get this<br>veiling idea right it's in 33:53 and<br>here's what it says believers do not<br>enter the prophets apartments for a meal<br>unless you are given perm<br>to do so do not linger until a meal is<br>ready when you were invited enter then<br>when you take in your meal depart do not<br>stay on and talk for that would offend<br>the prophet though he would shrink from<br>asking you to leave but God does not<br>shrink from the truth<br>here's the key sentence when you ask his<br>that the prophets wives for something do<br>so from behind a screen this is pure<br>both for your hearts and for theirs<br>what's going on here<br>after CATIA died in 619 the Prophet<br>remarried during his lifetime he had<br>between 11 and 13 wives total depending<br>on how you count marriage ceremonies<br>almost all of them were to cement peace<br>treaties with Concord tribes and at one<br>of his marriages the guests were hanging<br>out we kind of all do that at weddings<br>hang out you know enjoy but he's a<br>polite guy he says no I'm not going to<br>kick you out of my house and they want<br>to see the wife they want to see the<br>bride you know wish you look like all<br>that so this revelation comes and it<br>says if you want to chat with them do so<br>from behind the screen well now now<br>let's use first of all we just use<br>historical interpretation we just<br>noticed that this is a historically<br>time-bound passage it's addressing a<br>specific moment in time and now let's<br>use a bit of independent reasoning do so<br>from behind a screen here's the<br>possibility put the screen in between<br>the I'm the guy you're the bride put it<br>between us right and that's happened to<br>me lots of restaurants and I come in and<br>Dubai or wherever and boom the screen<br>comes down or put the screen on the<br>woman right the veil hey there's a third<br>possibility it goes on me I get to wear<br>the veil right and why is she wearing<br>the veil the guys decide<br>all right guys is that okay so there are<br>other passages to be sure that talk<br>about dress and modesty which enjoying<br>both genders to be modest now let me<br>come to this one terrorism I was at a<br>meeting of the Indian society of<br>international law and I keep telling<br>them to change their acronym from ISIL<br>it's something else I get these emails<br>you know it's a from ISIL now alright<br>just change it just called the society<br>right put a little Indian flag that<br>would be really nice when I was at this<br>meeting of the new study international<br>in Delhi a few years ago and I hear that<br>in Pakistan there are clerics saying<br>that and I want to be careful computers<br>on video very that clerics are saying<br>not anything that it is all right to<br>kill a pregnant Israeli woman who's not<br>in the IDF anymore because she will bear<br>a child who will serve in the IDF and<br>I'm thinking where on earth could you<br>possibly justify this so I learned from<br>a lot from my special ops class in my<br>Kansas University Law Students and they<br>tell me when suspects are caught<br>terrorist suspects are caught and<br>interrogated by the FBI there's a new<br>director out here and they're<br>interrogated by the FBI they're shown a<br>copy of the Quran and say where does it<br>say in here that it was all right to<br>pull the suicide bombs and explode now<br>most of them don't know they never clue<br>the FBI guys know it much better than<br>then they do but if you press you're<br>going to get three passages and these<br>are the last three I'll mention the<br>interpret before we break for questions<br>these are known as the sword verses<br>there was a sword dance recently and in<br>Saudi Arabia by<br>and heads of state and here's their free<br>of them and the first one is known as<br>the jizya or tax verse here's what it<br>says fight those of the people of the<br>book who do not truly believe in God in<br>the last day who do not forbid what God<br>and His Messenger have forbidden who do<br>not obey the rule of Justice until they<br>pay the tax and agree to submit where's<br>the weapon in that first of all fight<br>fight does not immediately mean violence<br>we fight cases in court we fight in<br>faculty meetings all nonviolent the<br>people of the book who are they at a<br>minimum they are Jews Christians and<br>Muslims because they've all been given a<br>book Old Testament New Testament in the<br>Holy Quran I would argue using you see<br>odd<br>they include Buddhist Dhammapada they<br>include Hindus Vedas they include Sikhs<br>Guru Granth Saab in a modern<br>interpretation of what people of the<br>book mean but putting that aside those<br>who do not truly believe in God in the<br>last day well all of them pretty much do<br>ok who do not forbid what God needs<br>messenger forbidden immoral behavior<br>maybe who do not obey the rule of<br>justice until they pay the tax what's<br>the tax all about the tax known as the<br>jizya tax is a tax that conquering<br>Muslim armies across the ages from 632<br>ad through the Ottomans but particularly<br>in the you my odd and the obviously<br>caliphates would collect from non-muslim<br>populations in return for protection<br>from the Muslim forces I asked my Saudi<br>students so what is the jizya tax rate I<br>said we have no idea we never heard of<br>it you don't collect it anymore it's as<br>ancient stuff point is this is a tax in<br>or cement provision that is historical<br>so like reading an IRS statute from you<br>know like 1950 or something that's<br>fallen out of use what about the second<br>sword verse and the last two are called<br>the slaying verses when the four<br>forbidden months are over wherever<br>inside or outside the sanctuary in Mecca<br>that's the Grand Mosque you find the<br>polytheists kill them<br>seize them besiege them ambush them but<br>if they turn to God and maintain the<br>prayer and pay the prescribed arms let<br>them go on their own way for God is most<br>forgiving and merciful and if anyone of<br>the polytheists should seek your<br>protection grant it to him so that he<br>may hear the word of God<br>what sort of treaty could these<br>polytheists make with God and His<br>Messenger anyway<br>what's that old how would that justify<br>offensive terrorist operations well the<br>four forbidden months and the treaty<br>that's a big clue again this is<br>historically contextual passage around<br>the years 619 620 620 1 622 before the<br>great migration from Mecca to Medina the<br>Hydra when Jews Christians pagans<br>polytheists all non-muslims in Mecca who<br>were not converting to Islam and who<br>were not leaving the Muslims alone free<br>to worship the Meccan establishment is<br>sometimes known we're persecuting<br>Muslims driving from their than from<br>their homes and not letting them worship<br>in the Grand Mosque and in that case<br>Allah said through the Archangel it's<br>permissible to fight them even to kill<br>them the treaty was actually a pastry<br>with a<br>that lasted for four months and the<br>worry was what happens when the peace<br>treat that the truce is over if cut if<br>if violence starts again and we're being<br>driven now what this is really about<br>then is freedom of worship Allah is<br>saying if you have to defend your faith<br>and it's the last resort of violence<br>then you can do it but again it's<br>historically contextual to those years<br>and now the last passage of the the<br>second of a slang verses fight in God's<br>cause against those who fight you<br>against those who fight that's already<br>defensive but do not overstep the limits<br>we call that in public international law<br>the proportionality principle God does<br>not love those who overstep the limits<br>kill them wherever you encounter them<br>and drive them out from where they drove<br>you out for persecution is more serious<br>than killing persecution is marceia so<br>it's again the religious freedom being<br>persecuted for your religious faith hey<br>nobody drove a extremists out from their<br>homes they drove people out of the World<br>Trade Center including about 187 of my<br>wife colleagues so this passage doesn't<br>work either okay<br>and if you do fight if they do fight you<br>kill them that's what disbelievers<br>deserve but if they stop then God is<br>most forgiving and merciful<br>usually the first Clause is quoted by a<br>violent extremist leader if they do<br>fight you kill them that's what such<br>disbelievers deserve but they forget the<br>rest of the sentence but if they stop<br>then God is most forgiving and merciful<br>and in fact that's a good place to end<br>in to speak to take questions and<br>comments because I started with the<br>bismillah in our limited intellect we<br>can't<br>really know what God is<br>but Muslim scholars have 99 names for<br>God 99 attributes of God and when my<br>daughter was very small I bought a<br>beautiful blue pod with gold paint that<br>has the 99 names by a Syrian artist the<br>most common name most merciful most<br>compassionate<br>that's the authentic Islam and the<br>battle we're in now again is to<br>stimulate an understanding of authentic<br>from inauthentic Islamic teachings using<br>our minds our reason which the Prophet<br>Muhammad and the Quran both strongly<br>encourage us to do so with that thank<br>you for your attention I'm sorry I went<br>over a few minutes but I'm really happy<br>to try and answer I should have started<br>by saying I was very much a student of<br>this field is a lot of great scholars<br>across the ages centuries who study this<br>field but it's really important
