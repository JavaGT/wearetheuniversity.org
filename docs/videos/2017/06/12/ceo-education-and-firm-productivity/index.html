generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you very much for coming here I'm<br>talk and this is the first time ever in<br>my life that I've been invited I don't<br>know what that means but you know<br>certainly means something to me okay<br>now honestly you know I have it's a<br>little bit far away from France but it's<br>wonderful to be here and I hope that<br>this is the beginning of a very<br>productive relationship I wanted to talk<br>to you today a little bit about where<br>our team is going in terms of thinking<br>about you know the connection between<br>law institutions and firm productivity<br>which links back into the economy that's<br>what I want to talk a little bit about<br>and I think that there's no better place<br>to talk about this that in a law school<br>because you know in fact it all it's<br>kind of like very much rooted a big part<br>we have shown in the last 10 or 15 years<br>that a big part of the differences that<br>exist in terms of success the firm level<br>but also the economy level has to do a<br>lot with legal institutions ok but if<br>not it does not all of it ok that's a<br>big chunk and so the second part of what<br>I will talk about is precisely about you<br>know human capital of managers and how<br>you know actually that may explain a<br>huge part of the unexplained<br>productivity differences across firms<br>once we control for all of these you<br>know institutions that we've worked on<br>ok so that may link a little bit into<br>some of the issues about how we move<br>forward once we have gone through the<br>first wave of shocks to institutions so<br>I thought that I would talk a little bit<br>about two parts ok<br>I would first start talking about what I<br>think we know what I think we know of<br>course there's an intellectual debate<br>about everything I would say and I'm<br>sure that some of you may be on that<br>side or on this side you know whatever<br>you wonders and intellectual development<br>think that's a very interesting way to<br>move forward so but I think I've got a<br>talking first I give you a brief summary<br>about the impact of institutions on on<br>firms ok and then I would say that you<br>know<br>beyond all of what I think we know you<br>know there's this new wave of thinking<br>that we were working on what else is<br>missing which has to do with your<br>dedication so I will go through a couple<br>of papers that I have with my usual<br>co-authors you know LaPorta slide for<br>visioning on these two topics okay and<br>it all boils down to this idea that you<br>know it seems like you know this large<br>unexplained differences in productivity<br>among firms within the same industry<br>cannot really be rationalized from the<br>differences in institutions so we need<br>something else<br>okay and something else is going to be<br>you know we might like it or not okay<br>but it has to do a lot with the<br>education of the CEO and then I would<br>try to tell you why this education of<br>the CEO may actually be a factor so how<br>it allows the firm to exploit its<br>resources okay so that's what I would<br>talk about if that's okay if you if you<br>want to ask me questions you know as we<br>move along or if you want to just say<br>you know anything that you think it's<br>wrong from the very beginning just<br>please get our feel free to do that as<br>soon as you want okay good so we'll give<br>you a very brief view if you will about<br>the impact of institutions or firms what<br>I think we know and then we'll move on<br>to double your education okay so this is<br>in the last you know just this is just a<br>brief introduction so in the last in the<br>last you know now now it's not 20 or 25<br>years people have been thinking about<br>since the fall of the wall you know with<br>with the former communist countries and<br>you know a lot of the liberalization of<br>the economies people are thinking about<br>you know so what are good institutions<br>okay so how can we have how can we<br>promote good institutions good<br>regulations good laws across countries<br>it was fairly easy to have the<br>discussion you know back in the 80s at<br>the 70s and you know in the early 90s<br>because it was this capitalism versus<br>communism thing and then it was very<br>clear that you know some people were the<br>good signs of people were on the bad<br>side wherever you live - not that<br>depends of where you are okay so what<br>done but then the wall fell down and<br>then it's sort of like now everybody's<br>kind of like capital is put in fact<br>there is a lot of different forms of<br>capital<br>okay and so we saw that the<br>institution's within capitalist<br>countries actually vary quite widely<br>okay so that was kind of the idea and<br>you might say that all of these<br>institutions have the goal of you know<br>either economic or political have the<br>goal of promoting you know safer you<br>know better property rights and<br>investment and you know higher<br>investment our development and so on<br>when some of them do and some of them<br>don't<br>okay so what I will review I will review<br>the evidence that suggests that in fact<br>within capitalist economies the<br>institutions are very different I would<br>try to figure out where these<br>differences come from<br>okay I will tell you you know where we<br>are so it comes from legal systems<br>differences in legal systems so I'll<br>come back it comes back to law so we are<br>at you know at the root of the problem<br>in this school okay and then I will try<br>to tell you show you some very you know<br>pictures that shows that this actually<br>matters quite a bit okay and then we<br>move to what is missing okay fine okay<br>so you know step back and so we wrote at<br>at some point we've got a few papers<br>about you know we're you know<br>institutions come from okay and we say<br>well you think about you know an economy<br>and a gas an economy is developing you<br>know it starts to figure out how it<br>should regulate itself some form of<br>another and as it's trying to regulate<br>itself you know you might think that<br>those that are in power try to set up<br>the institutions that that that make the<br>rules for business to thrive okay<br>now you would think that you know people<br>would choose efficient institutions<br>right based on what they are but nobody<br>you know but this but there may be the<br>case that institutions that are chosen<br>are not optimal or efficient from the<br>beginning okay and these are two big<br>channels theoretically to the channels<br>that might explain when the situation's<br>that we observe today across countries<br>may not be efficient or the optimal ones<br>for each country because sometimes<br>politicians mess them up okay and<br>politicians you know choose or or<br>manipulate institutions because if wanna<br>pursue other goals okay you know their<br>own goals rather than live also society<br>either they protect their friends or<br>you know whatever you want okay so that<br>so this involves some inefficiency away<br>from the patient institutions and<br>actually leads to what some and<br>empirically we're going to see some<br>excessive regulation okay<br>the second channel which is the one that<br>my co-authors and I have been exploding<br>is this channel of colonial<br>transplantation that is forget about<br>politicians you know on top of<br>politicians not everybody gets to choose<br>what are the institutions that day that<br>they have because at some point somebody<br>got conquered okay and you know so this<br>is you know it's good or bad whatever<br>you want they're not gonna make any<br>statement this is not we're not going to<br>say that you know colonial powers were<br>terrible and we should repent you know<br>for the rest of our lives<br>the fact is for our foreign service that<br>through colonial transplantation as the<br>British you know you know land with the<br>ships you know they bring the common law<br>and as Napoleon moves around you know he<br>brings his codes okay so a couple of<br>hundred years later it so happens that<br>you really didn't choose the<br>institutions that you had it actually<br>was the Brits that brought them to you<br>or Napoleon that brought them to you or<br>a couple of other guys floating around<br>okay that didn't take them so this is<br>the big map that we economists not very<br>smart we just discover like 20 or 25<br>years ago<br>okay which is in fact you lawyers must<br>have known this for a long time we just<br>discovered it a few years ago and we<br>said well in fact not everybody gets to<br>choose the institutions this is another<br>inefficient source of laws okay not<br>efficient laws because whatever was<br>optimal in Britain need not be optimal<br>in New Zealand okay whatever was optimal<br>in France need not be optimal in<br>Indonesia right just because the poor<br>and sort of like took over the<br>Netherlands and real escape is to own<br>Indonesia then bang 200 years later<br>Indonesia has French Napoleonic Code it<br>doesn't mean that it initially developed<br>its best set of institutions in<br>particular you know what we're going to<br>talk about commercial institutions okay<br>so this map gives you like the origins<br>of the laws so we see that a lot of<br>countries in the<br>world have other borrow that loss from<br>common law or for French civil law which<br>is everything that is in orange so you<br>see that the biggest French export is<br>not really wine okay bad French<br>Napoleonic Code okay it's not L'Oreal<br>but French lapel and coats okay so what<br>we have here is that those guys you know<br>basically cover about 75 percent or 80<br>percent of the world then there is you<br>know the German that never really liked<br>the French so the Bismarck that develops<br>its code and then and then you know you<br>know by you know by the fact that the<br>Japanese wanted to copy the last thing<br>in life okay which was the German codes<br>through the Meiji Restoration then they<br>bring the German codes and then China<br>boom has German Napoleonic codes by<br>accident 200 years later okay<br>and that's that's what explains you know<br>who gets the loss okay so you see how<br>China gave these very random<br>institutions just because you know a few<br>things happened in the last 100 years<br>okay<br>then there's the weird guys in<br>Scandinavia fishing themselves up<br>Scandinavian codes and then the three<br>red weirdos that you know are about to<br>disappear okay or blow up God knows okay<br>so but mostly so but mostly these are<br>the places that this is the origins of<br>the laws okay and this happened to be a<br>very powerful map that we economies did<br>not have a clue about until you know the<br>late 1990s okay so with this mapping we<br>said AHA this is very important because<br>you know we we can break the chicken and<br>the egg problem which in economics we<br>will call in degenerate that is you know<br>is indicate that institutions developed<br>to protect markets okay or is it that<br>markets were very big and therefore they<br>developed law to protect the big money<br>okay after all you and you might as well<br>know where our law school law is a<br>luxury good okay so you only have it<br>when you can pay for it okay what is<br>worthwhile having it okay so this<br>chicken and egg problem gets broken up<br>by the fact that you did in this side<br>you know to develop your level of<br>institutions is the Brits gave it to you<br>they landed in your Shore<br>boom this is what you have okay so for<br>us in economics is very powerful because<br>it's called an exogenous instrument that<br>it will break the chicken and the egg<br>cycle and then before we can say now we<br>know it goes from law to markets okay so<br>this was very powerful in that sense and<br>this is what it will allow me to say<br>that all of the graphs that I will show<br>you next which summarize like ten or<br>twelve years of evidence that we have<br>actually have some econometrics validate<br>if you will that is we're not just<br>talking about correlations okay this is<br>linked to that but I don't know what<br>comes first we're talking about<br>causality in some sense okay so we have<br>this thing so this is a theme that three<br>things that we don't think that we know<br>okay and as I said there's obviously<br>discussion about this okay but I think<br>that even the most you know a theorist<br>opponents of this view would actually<br>have to agree with this slide okay so<br>the cipher says you know it so happens<br>that it all started in financed by the<br>way so we started with law and finance<br>although effect finance and it basically<br>says in our regal legal rules of a first<br>thing that we know is a legal rules of<br>investor protection based in financial<br>markets can be measured I know that you<br>know in law school and lawyers think<br>that nothing can be measured I<br>understand that okay but you know<br>because everything depends on something<br>and depends on something that depends on<br>something fine maybe we didn't do the<br>best measurement that we can but you<br>know we have done several measurements<br>and we all seem to be very close okay it<br>seems that if you measure it maybe not<br>be perfect a loss can be measured then<br>encoded across countries okay I'll show<br>that some countries have stronger<br>protections to investors than others<br>okay so some protect investors and some<br>do not<br>that's a fact if you call them and that<br>these legal rules you know which show<br>different levels of investor protection<br>actually very systematically among legal<br>traditions they slide that I showed you<br>before where the French legal origin<br>countries in particularly are not very<br>keen on protecting investor<br>and the British common law country seems<br>to be the one to protect investors the<br>most okay<br>moving with you on Finance okay the next<br>decade pretty much has shown that you<br>know in fact civil law and in particular<br>French civil law where you can<br>generalize it to see below in general<br>that is non common law not only shows<br>heavy hand of you know if you will<br>government involvement in the control of<br>capital markets but also in other areas<br>of the economy okay so we can see that<br>civil law has shows exhibits a much<br>heavier hand of the government in all of<br>the areas that basically regulate<br>business okay they work in a business<br>okay so what I would try to show you is<br>I said imagine that you looked at the<br>regulation of this is a good time for<br>you to take in small areas yes okay<br>because this is where it started this is<br>what we measured but in fact you know<br>contract law so you know when we talked<br>about contract law it was a little bit<br>later okay that has to be mostly where<br>we look when we when we talked about<br>contract law was mostly embedded into<br>the labor regulation okay so the<br>approach that people have about you know<br>how you have a labeled relationship okay<br>but if you looked at you know contract<br>law in general you would observe those<br>difference but we started with you know<br>it all species I'm telling you what to<br>where we started you all started with<br>what should we call it with shareholder<br>rights and creditor rights that's how it<br>all started and then we moved into other<br>areas of law which have to do with labor<br>law which have to do with you know<br>securities law our security regulation<br>of Social Security which has to do the<br>way you open up a business which is you<br>know it just has moved on into the way<br>anything a lot of the areas of business<br>okay and embedded its contract law so<br>Civil Procedure we also like that okay<br>absolutely but I'm just telling you what<br>I think you know so how it started okay<br>absolutely but if you looked at<br>contractor you would observe<br>so very marked differences around that<br>okay good so let me just try to show you<br>a little bit of water where we started<br>and then we'll jump to the missing part<br>so this is the positive part okay so you<br>see that how so this is more or less so<br>from the different legal origins these<br>are all of it I'm not gonna focus only<br>on contract law okay so you see these<br>are all of the areas of law that have<br>been codified in some form of another<br>and you see that they map nicely into<br>some specific market outcomes okay<br>that's what you know that summarizes all<br>of the evidence okay if you put all of<br>these you organize them in these three<br>buckets okay let's say that you<br>organized in three buckets that is<br>financial regulation<br>you know court proceedings and then<br>other kinds of regulation governing<br>involvement you would have served a very<br>big differences among bucket okay<br>so this will be let's say that this is<br>bucket number one so this graph just<br>tells you various measurements okay what<br>you have in the in the lower indices<br>each of these names it's a different<br>paper that measures different types of<br>protections of investors and you can see<br>you know imagine that common law is zero<br>you can see this comes from regressions<br>okay controlling for everything else so<br>you can see how all of the other civil<br>law systems which are the French the<br>German and Scandinavia tend to be lower<br>in investor protection and much more in<br>involvement of government in banking so<br>there is more protected more and more<br>government involving backing so you can<br>see that it seems that inside terms of<br>financial regulation<br>you know common-law countries are less<br>invasive and it turns out that this<br>actually impacts very heavily these<br>calls comes from regressions controlling<br>for everything that you can think of<br>okay it says that for example if you<br>increase in other review protection of<br>investors that call that anti<br>self-dealing then you have bigger stock<br>markets okay as a proportion of the<br>economy and lower you know what people<br>call a control premium that is the value<br>of controlling a firm okay because you<br>can extract less okay so it also shows<br>you for example that if you protect your<br>creditors further you have bigger<br>big markets ok or bigger financial<br>institutions yeah just on the previous<br>slide you see losing a trial in Ceylon<br>is always an outlier<br>you know geographically and you know in<br>many other ways I mean it's not really<br>an outlier you're complaining about that<br>stuff and it doesn't mean look at hong<br>kong lots much water in switzerland okay<br>no this is you know given you know but<br>this goes back to the conversation that<br>that i just had with precisely with<br>susan okay so Susan was telling me that<br>eva is like you know here we are sitting<br>in you Ceylon and we've done a lot of<br>the stuff right so we have a lot of this<br>right okay and we're not up there we're<br>down there so what else is going on okay<br>so you see that insulin is not down<br>there all the time but this is a very<br>big question and I would love I would<br>love to work on that this way where I<br>was telling Susan maybe we should start<br>thinking about trying to figure out how<br>these outliers may come to the line<br>absolutely<br>okay now not everybody needs to fit the<br>line so there's there is differences so<br>this is exactly how can we make New<br>Zealand move up there down there<br>it doesn't look at body that other one<br>okay so so there which is about the<br>control limits that I were very close to<br>the line okay so yes there is some idea<br>value to the idea that New Zealand is an<br>outline not just geographically but you<br>know we have to we have to think about<br>most are we call to our economies or no<br>but this is you know this is you know<br>but this is what this is precisely<br>saying now there's more agricultural<br>countries that we don't need to explain<br>every point okay but the point of what<br>it's saying is like if you protect<br>investors more can you raise capital<br>okay can you access capital markets more<br>okay this is what this is saying okay<br>and I don't see why any reason why you<br>know agricultural firms may also list in<br>stock markets okay you know I understand<br>that farms poppin Mountain Farms don't<br>okay but they may you know there's very<br>very big agricultural firms at least -<br>okay just like small normal pop shops<br>don't list<br>okay so for firms agriculture my tool<br>you know I know you think about it you<br>don't think about this one in terms of<br>creditors not insulin protects creditors<br>quite a bit so this is great right and<br>in fact if you look at the credit market<br>so a lot of you know part of it is like<br>a lot of the capital is coming to New<br>Zealand verbs that would seem to be<br>right on the credit market it doesn't<br>seem to be right on the stock market but<br>it seems to be kind of like rival would<br>predict in the credit market okay but<br>also in in terms of government ownership<br>of banks you see that you know this also<br>shows that you know the more<br>governorship of mugs you have the least<br>inefficient banking systems that you<br>have its interest rate spread for bigger<br>okay so this is you know we have several<br>to use the last one the one that I'm<br>showing you in this graph is from 2005<br>to 2013 or fourteen I cannot remember<br>okay so it's a decade because this is<br>the revision that we did for the paper<br>that we did the chapter that we have in<br>this handbook of 2000 eval 2016 so<br>probably we stopped it 2014 okay yes but<br>if you did this graph from nineteen you<br>know from you know from 1995 to 2005 you<br>will find all of the same this is not I<br>mean this is not this is not really that<br>the period doesn't seem to with long<br>lasting institutions okay now so that<br>was bucket number one<br>okay now given the time that I have I'm<br>going to talk very briefly about bucket<br>number two and bucket number cereal was<br>I've never corrected to managerial so<br>that was the idea that you know<br>institutions the financial market<br>matters of the development financial<br>markets okay<br>second bucket of regulation okay let's<br>keep that regulators are thieves so that<br>does explain much okay<br>so here's the second one which is a<br>government regulation in other areas of<br>the economy so regulation of how you<br>open up a business regulation of entry<br>that's regulation of labor how invasive<br>you know how difficult it is to fire and<br>hire people<br>okay the involvement of government in<br>the press and you know even development<br>of government in the army you seek out<br>the French or the civil law is much more<br>invasive<br>come on lower cross and that has impact<br>also in the labor market okay when I<br>show so this shows you that if you make<br>it very hard for firms to open up okay<br>you what you have is a lot more<br>corruption in fact okay and then you'd<br>having a much bigger unofficial economy<br>so this suggests that you know what<br>you're not buying in all of this<br>protection you know doesn't buy you much<br>as you regulate Labor's a lot more labor<br>markets if you regulate the more you<br>makers stickier okay sort of like you<br>see that how you know so labor force<br>participation Goes Down and unemployment<br>rates go up in a particularly employment<br>of the poor okay of the poor of a young<br>okay which then become poor okay this is<br>the last area which is judicial<br>institutions in others you know this is<br>another you know sort of like courts and<br>this is various measures that we have<br>about court you know you see that you<br>know formalism in court so this uh so<br>this is like Civil Procedure measuring<br>Civil Procedure and how you go about<br>collecting a check or a victim at<br>analysis of stuff that we did in the<br>past or have three other judges from the<br>Supreme Court from government influence<br>let's say so you can see that common law<br>seems to be less formalistic and gives<br>more freedom to courts okay and you see<br>how that actually fits into you know<br>less formalism let more formalism sorry<br>fits into longer times in court and in<br>the end it buys you nothing in terms of<br>you know what people think about you<br>know contract enforcement okay yes Oh No<br>thank you for telling me not I don't<br>exclude them I'm measuring everybody<br>else against the British against the<br>common law origin okay<br>so common law would be here I know she<br>doesn't like me to do that because I'm<br>in this gun so common law would be here<br>okay so that I'm trying to show that you<br>know there's differences versus common<br>law okay that's what I'm trying to say<br>okay absolutely we do not want to<br>exclude the common law disease you know<br>absolutely not you know the French would<br>lie<br>would come along but we're not gonna do<br>that okay good<br>so this basically says is three buckets<br>Matt into something real<br>okay and so if we were to summarize this<br>you know it says that you know maybe as<br>we think about it there seems to be a<br>lot you know the institutions are not<br>you know very effective okay we saw that<br>the Dean officials come from politics<br>and from colonial transplantation so we<br>may be moving into inefficiently high<br>levels of regulation and we also see<br>that you know a lot of it even more<br>higher stuff in official regulation<br>would be probably in French or in<br>similar countries that in common law<br>countries which which started with less<br>invasive regulation okay fine okay no<br>we're going this way<br>fine so that's the part that I think we<br>know okay so we think that there is this<br>very large component of the efficiency<br>of firms and the productivity of firms<br>and that comes out of the impact of<br>institutions okay and the way we measure<br>that was by comparing across countries<br>the differences in the institutions<br>other people have started to go in<br>differences legal institutions within<br>countries okay some measuring<br>differences within countries about<br>different institutions okay so some<br>countries perhaps some provinces have<br>different institutions and others okay<br>so some you know that there's a very<br>large literature on that and also we're<br>going to get all of those numbers when<br>we move into the next phase which is<br>moving into firms and regions<br>okay so the first part of the talk was<br>to try to try to say you know listen I<br>think we know what its length some<br>differences in these two are in<br>productivity but they're still you know<br>the big puzzle that we observe there is<br>that there's still very big differences<br>in productivity among firms within very<br>narrow industries okay within the same<br>country we which has the same<br>institutions okay so this is not data<br>for me okay so this is data from the<br>kings of the guise of measuring you know<br>total factor productivity okay so this<br>is the summary of<br>this is the summary of what people have<br>found out okay if you look at for<br>example this is the u.s. you look at the<br>grass below this is you know total<br>factor productivity TFP q okay and you<br>can see like let's say that you know one<br>is sort of like what we have that at the<br>center okay you can see that it can go<br>all the way up to four or five<br>okay versus one bill you put this one<br>versus four most productive firms food<br>is four or five the least productive<br>firms you know produce one sixty-fourth<br>of you know apples okay so you can see<br>that there is humongous productivity<br>differences within even within economies<br>that I supposedly have very large arches<br>to capital markets like the US think<br>about the u.s. very large access to<br>capital market hopefully very good<br>institutions blah blah blah they're<br>still very large productivity<br>differences if you move to developing<br>countries you know so there's something<br>like China or India you can see that<br>these productivity differences may be<br>even wider okay so therefore the talk of<br>today so it's like what is it that may<br>explain this or the part I mean I what I<br>have just talked to you about is I said<br>you know we can explain a lot of the<br>stuff that we have in the world from<br>here this difference between this and<br>this this is three it's all of what I<br>said<br>okay now I'm interested in explaining<br>here or here okay so we we figure that<br>out a little bit okay we have not<br>figured this out completely okay so<br>that's what I want to talk about okay<br>any other questions now okay good okay<br>so what explain these productivity<br>differences okay so we economies as<br>usually takes us forever to do anything<br>like you know years to do a quick fix<br>quickly just wipe them down we sort of<br>like you know we have not figured much<br>of the stuff and we definitely don't<br>like to write things down okay so you<br>know we have long as to create about<br>this productivity the differences that<br>we've studied as well sums of obvious it<br>has to do with inputs right so of course<br>you have more inputs or better quality<br>of inputs then<br>you can explain higher productivity okay<br>so you know so we the traditional<br>approach uses like raw materials capital<br>labor technology blah blah blah blah<br>blah and when you put all of that in<br>there's still humongous differences in<br>productivity that we cannot explain okay<br>therefore we said well this is not going<br>to get us very far so when I need to<br>move to the next thing so what about<br>human like human capital human capital<br>of managers okay<br>there's been some work about human<br>capital of labor and that has actually<br>shown that it explained a little bit but<br>not a lot okay so work is human capital<br>education of young workers didn't seem<br>to be like a humongous you're a factor<br>and explaining the productivity<br>differences okay so what we have is good<br>with so what we did is we said why don't<br>we try to go and get new data okay<br>across countries across wages across<br>firms in the world in different regions<br>in different countries and we try to see<br>the human capital explains a lot okay so<br>that's what we did okay so we try to<br>analyze the regular and compare you know<br>the the impact of human capital of<br>managers but also we're going to have<br>workers such as we have so mention into<br>the firm productivity differences okay<br>good okay so fine so let me skip all of<br>these guys that say that there's just to<br>say that there's many factors that I<br>make Spillane productivity differences<br>and ability start by saying how do we<br>start so we start by actually looking at<br>sorry we start by looking at differences<br>in productivity within countries that is<br>within regions and then we look at<br>differences the productivity of firms<br>within each region okay<br>because if there are differences in<br>productivity within countries that comes<br>from differences in regions then we're<br>going to be attaching too much to the<br>differences of which is just by firms in<br>fact there may be regional factors<br>within the country that I explained part<br>of the difference and then there will be<br>firm level factors so we have country<br>level factors which is what I talked<br>about so we throw that into<br>hi now we're going to work within<br>countries among different regions and<br>first I will show you that there are<br>very large differences you know in human<br>capital across regions and that they<br>have an impact in productivity within<br>the region and then we're going to see<br>at the third level within those regions<br>differences in productivity in firms and<br>then we see that is the human capital of<br>the intrapreneur that explains a bunch<br>okay is that clear okay fine<br>so but first I need to get with from<br>step one to step two which is I'm going<br>to work with regions now okay so in<br>order to do that you know we worked like<br>crazy for five years okay and we got<br>this data okay so we say we're going to<br>shut the world in 2005 okay and we're<br>going to see that we have a 2010 okay so<br>we're going to see all a ton of data I<br>will show you what kind of data for all<br>of these regions in blue so we know we<br>don't have country data we have regional<br>level data okay so we have a few regions<br>missing in Africa because they don't<br>collect statistics Rana we couldn't<br>force all of them to collect them okay<br>but we forced a few okay and then so we<br>can see that we have all of the<br>differences in region so within the US<br>we're going to be talking about data at<br>the state level okay<br>so within Australia we're going to be<br>talking about data about those guys you<br>know the New Zealand we're going to be<br>talking about data while not within<br>those within the different regions okay<br>is that clear<br>so it's like a ton of data so we have<br>you know about fifteen hundred and sixty<br>nine regions in 110 countries okay<br>that's more or less what we have and so<br>we're collecting data of all of that<br>stuff sorry we're collecting data on<br>geography that is Endowment so we have<br>now there's all of these you know tech<br>stuff like my apps and so let's totally<br>collected from satellites and so on so<br>we have temperatures distance from the<br>capital of the region to the coast<br>resources like oil blah blah blah blah<br>blah that we have institutions as we<br>said institutions are<br>there's deficiencies in institutions<br>within regions of the same countries<br>that we have all of those like<br>corruption and you know at you know<br>access to finance blah blah blah then we<br>have infrastructure so we know about you<br>know electricity density we know about a<br>ton of other stuff okay then we have<br>other values like there may be<br>differences there's a cultural<br>differences or we have cultural trust<br>bla bla bla ethno-linguistic<br>fractionalization and you know religions<br>and all of that stuff fractionalization<br>and a lot of that stuff so that's like<br>humongous amount of data with you know<br>which people hopefully can use and are<br>using and then we also have obviously<br>population differences and so on okay so<br>we collect all of that data okay and<br>this is what comes out of that as a<br>vegan so I'm just going to summarize<br>imagine that you took countries now we<br>all got what I'm going to try to show<br>you is what explains differences of you<br>know income per capita which we read<br>you're not which could be called<br>productivity of the region okay so the<br>productivity across regions within<br>countries okay<br>so look at where you know look at Russia<br>okay so Russia these are all of the<br>different you know Oblast or regions if<br>you will and controlling for other<br>factors okay<br>control a knack for institutions blah<br>blah blah blah blah okay you know if you<br>look at productivity differences among<br>regions you can see that the average<br>level of school this is a education of<br>the average person in the region<br>explains quite a bit okay of the<br>difference is the productivity that does<br>not have to do with endowments that does<br>not have to do with institutions that<br>does not have to do with temperature<br>does not have to do with all of those<br>theories or fractionalization or culture<br>of ethnic fractionalization and culture<br>it's education that seems to be driving<br>the day if you actually I just show you<br>four countries for example but if you<br>pull the hundred and ten countries<br>together okay this is the net effect so<br>you have you know you put all the<br>foreign countries and together you put<br>the variation that you have from each of<br>this country within<br>and then you see you know each of these<br>dots you know for example each of these<br>does if this is a different province in<br>this country so you can see different<br>provinces within because that's what we<br>have multiple of the same okay so you<br>can see that the net effect controlling<br>for temperature you know what you can<br>call geography temperature distance of<br>course you know resources which you know<br>we take all oil population center etc<br>and even country dummies a lot of it has<br>to do with education in fact when you<br>look at look at not just dream and<br>compare it with institutions okay if you<br>look at the years of education for you<br>know we have it for 104 countries<br>homogenized okay you can see that it<br>explains first of all between countries<br>okay education explains about 58 percent<br>of you know of the r-square okay so the<br>r-square is it just for education is a<br>very simple one like univariate<br>explications<br>education explains 58 percent and you<br>know informal opinions will be an<br>institution corruption let's say 21% and<br>trust would be about 80 percentage you<br>would say you know they're all kind of<br>like their education is very big three<br>times as big but you know either there<br>but once you move within countries it<br>sounds like all of those institutions<br>like like corruption and so on and so<br>forth and trust just collapse in terms<br>of the power to explain and it's<br>education that seems to be the driver of<br>the differences within yes okay so you<br>take the average level of education of<br>the population within the region the<br>Oh but okay so fine it's a very good<br>question this is what it's called a<br>partial scatterplot so I'm it's not it's<br>not the actual number this is imagine<br>you've run a regression that says you<br>know here you have on this on this sort<br>of like the variable that I'm trying to<br>explain its income per capita<br>okay log of income per capita and that's<br>going to depend on temperature oil<br>resources blah blah blah blah blah and<br>the log of years of education okay now<br>what I'm showing you there is the<br>coefficient on this and the variation<br>around that coefficient controlling for<br>everything else okay<br>so the coefficient of that regression<br>okay it's point 27 so that's controlling<br>for everything else and that's the<br>variation around it does the district<br>istic of that coefficient so it's not at<br>the actual number of years but so it's<br>kind of like you know it's being<br>processed through this machine so it<br>gives you the variation normalizes<br>somewhere around two or something okay<br>so it's not the actual number of years<br>this is what you know Larry Summers<br>called partial scatter plots okay which<br>is the net effect that's why I call it<br>the net effect okay so you can't really<br>read the number as a number it you have<br>to just read the slope okay yes okay so<br>we cannot I mean this is very big we<br>could not do that absolutely yes yes I<br>mean I understand that you know one year<br>you know in in Switzerland may be better<br>than one year in let me know say another<br>country okay but you know in another<br>we can't really do that I will show you<br>when we move to firms okay when we move<br>to a government okay I will show you<br>that actually may matter you know the<br>quality of education may matter when we<br>talk about CEOs okay but you know<br>ideally we could do this but the other<br>we're going to have data for 110<br>countries with the quality of education<br>with the same granularity it's very<br>tough we have some measures okay so I<br>will show you some<br>you know about absenteeism like like<br>what is this ABS data okay so it does<br>have an impact okay I wish I had that<br>but this already was a very big effort<br>but that point very well taken okay good<br>so that's at the original level so that<br>so then we said oh my god occasion<br>explains a lot so what about at a firm<br>level okay so now we get to the CEOs<br>okay okay let me skip that it just tells<br>you that when you put in education this<br>works a lot so now we will get the firm<br>level statistics okay let me skip that<br>we're going to look at the firm level<br>and what were your firm in firm level<br>now imagine that you have firms okay so<br>once we clean the sample you know we<br>have this is like you know we have about<br>13 or you know twenty thousand depending<br>on the data that you have we're trying<br>to explain firm level productivity that<br>is sales per employee productivity<br>controlling for a lot of stuff okay you<br>know country fixed effects into two<br>fixed effects all of that stuff and then<br>we have resources we have about you know<br>this would be resource like energy<br>resources of property plant and<br>equipment and so on and so forth and<br>what we observe is that controlling for<br>all of that I'm controlling for the<br>regional education okay education of the<br>region which is the effect that I showed<br>you before which is significant the one<br>that comes out you know worker education<br>is important<br>you know statistically significant but<br>once you normalize that you actually do<br>the calibration is when a Giri education<br>seems to be the wonderful today okay it<br>explains about four to five times<br>because the impact that worker education<br>has so we're not saying that isn't that<br>the educated workers do not help for the<br>productivity we're saying that the<br>educated CEOs have a humongous impact<br>okay so this is where like summarizing<br>into sort of like so now we have only<br>like 30 countries where we have all of<br>these incredible data about expenditures<br>or energy and expenses as I move some of<br>these things remove some of these things<br>then I get into much much more countries<br>right so this is not giving you the<br>toughest thing when you remove that it's<br>even better so this will be like the<br>toughest regression okay and actually<br>you know that the toughest stuff is one<br>either so the last one would be this one<br>where we have if you really want to be<br>very very you know very very very<br>concise and wanna just go to the top of<br>sample where you have all of the data<br>you move it all the way up to here and<br>still and it's very very big okay okay<br>so what does it mean okay so they're<br>able to suggest that you know the we<br>have been Mis estimated that returns to<br>education to managers okay because we<br>haven't really been measuring them and<br>putting them in the equation for<br>productivity<br>we just haven't we focus on the<br>education of workers and we have<br>forgotten about the addition of managers<br>okay and they seem to be the education<br>of the CEO make by the way the measure<br>that we have is the education of the CEO<br>I don't have measures of Education of<br>second level manager at this level so I<br>have the years of the creation of the<br>CEO across firms okay all firms and then<br>we're going to control for industry and<br>whatever you are so you can do it mister<br>whether it's for all cash it's all in<br>manufacturing all manufacturing so we're<br>going to throw our financials and<br>culture this is all manufacturing okay<br>but it's many different you know<br>industry culture manufacturing but it's<br>Amanda that's very voice of<br>also have a number of years of<br>experience Lucia I don't have that so it<br>may very well be that a very highly<br>educated person would be very health<br>productivity but it's because that<br>person had 20 years of experience yes<br>sure it could be I mean it could be okay<br>so what we do now and I think you know<br>we don't show it here what we do have is<br>how many years the guy has been in the<br>firm okay I don't think we have it in<br>these regressions okay because it didn't<br>turned out once you control for that I<br>didn't turned out to be that important<br>what we have if you can be working in<br>multiple establishments we have the age<br>of the firm which turned out to be most<br>older firms tend to be a little more<br>productive and that seems to be very<br>correlated with what we threw it out in<br>the end because that seems to be very<br>correlated with the years of experience<br>of the CEO and this one actually turns<br>to be better than the other one okay so<br>we have that for this very small sample<br>we don't have that for this very very<br>large and a 40,000 sample okay so when<br>we get into this and I was really trying<br>to get all of the stories apart okay we<br>still get that is actually the years of<br>Education on top of on top of that so<br>it's it's I mean it's not that it's<br>experience doesn't matter but it sort of<br>like kind of like gets gets subsumed<br>okay now the age of the firm which is<br>very correlated to the to the experience<br>of the CEO it's important we know that<br>all the firm's you don't learn more and<br>so on and so forth okay<br>so that's part of it so that's a very<br>good that's a very good point now why do<br>we think that people actually have<br>whatever thing that these CEOs may be<br>very good for the firm's and this is<br>just speculative this is somewhere where<br>we actually need to go okay so it could<br>be that firms you know that educated<br>sitios may be better at organizing<br>production management firms or adopting<br>or developing new technologies okay that<br>could very well be the case or it could<br>be that you know the different systemize<br>individual education explain why<br>I normal films are able to take on<br>opportunities okay so good free policies<br>may not be successfully adopted by all<br>firms because these firms do not or<br>cannot afford high schema capital of<br>CEOs or highly educated managers may be<br>able to adopt much faster something new<br>that comes out okay so they may be<br>faster at getting I getting at it we do<br>not have any clue about that yet okay we<br>don't you know maybe some people do but<br>you know we don't okay<br>and now not at this level so but it<br>sounds to me it's it's correlated to a<br>do I have time to do the next one<br>are you serious okay so let me take five<br>minutes okay okay just five minutes okay<br>so then so then we said okay how can we<br>go a little bit deeper and trying to<br>figure out what makes the difference<br>okay<br>and then we said well there's this other<br>big puzzle about there is such a big<br>puzzle about you know why our<br>governments different governments so why<br>are governments some governments<br>efficient and some governments are very<br>inefficient okay<br>so that's a very big question so the one<br>of the reasons is why others political<br>economy reasons you know there's some<br>guys that are very corrupt there is some<br>you know all of that stuff that the<br>typical stories okay and then we said<br>well another reason is maybe okay is you<br>know some governments have bad managers<br>okay and these bad managers are just bad<br>managers that they just can organize<br>production just like a firm okay so this<br>is when we decide so this is the idea<br>that low productivity of government<br>service may be similar to the low<br>productivity in the private sector okay<br>so there is inferior inputs human and<br>physical capital and technology and<br>there may be poor management that comes<br>out of it okay but now we need to design<br>an experiment that allows us to you know<br>remove all of these stories from the<br>equation so take them out of the room<br>that these stories cannot explain these<br>productivity differences okay<br>it can only be about human capital and<br>initial resources okay so that's when we<br>design this this paper<br>that's called letters so cancer people<br>is called letters so what we said is<br>like obviously measuring government<br>officials too big okay so we're going to<br>focus on one single service which is<br>very simple which is mail every country<br>has mail<br>okay post office okay and we're going to<br>focus on mailing a simple letter okay<br>like a very simple letter okay<br>so what we did is you know we sat you<br>know and then we mail letters to a<br>hundred and fifty nine countries we<br>mailed ten letters okay to to each of<br>the five largest cities in each country<br>and the letter basically cut a piece of<br>paper that said I am you know a fella<br>porta you know I wanted you know to get<br>in touch with you to carry out you know<br>research project okay that's all of the<br>letter says more or less we have to<br>learn here now I have the envelopes okay<br>so but what we know we kind of like<br>trick the post office because we put the<br>address included chironex the right city<br>and the zip code but there was the wrong<br>Street and business name okay so so this<br>is then we send them and we know we're<br>sending in two waves because then you<br>can instrument second wave with the<br>first wave all of that stuff that<br>econometricians like to do okay so the<br>letter was one-page business letter in<br>English the question I response from the<br>recipient okay and then we waited for<br>you know I don't know God the amount of<br>months like fourteen months or something<br>over 420 420 days so laughs oh you know<br>LaPorta would go every day to his mail<br>you know in Harvard and he will pick up<br>his mail and he would mark down okay I<br>got the letter on you know the 3rd of<br>January of 2012 ok so we knew when we<br>posted the letter I when you would laugh<br>about it okay and and this is the kind<br>of envelope that we had so we waited for<br>four hundred and twenty days okay notice<br>that the beauty of the experiment is<br>that this is a letter okay so it's like<br>you know<br>like you want to steal the letter okay<br>so it's not contraption okay so the<br>officials you know the cook someone<br>wants to steal if it was not a twenty<br>dollar bill<br>okay it doesn't take really a genius to<br>sort of like figure out that the letter<br>doesn't go to the right others you just<br>put it on the different in a beam okay<br>so it takes away a lot of the political<br>economy story so we just focus it on<br>resources okay so that allows us to<br>build a production function that says<br>well the productivity this is the<br>productivity how many ladies returned<br>back to us our Harvard within the period<br>there is a convention we didn't know<br>about this for you isn't so much about<br>stuff that you really don't care so<br>there is this convention okay<br>the postal office around the world<br>dating back from 1969 that basically<br>says that 159 countries which is the<br>ones that we send others to sign this<br>convention that says that when the<br>letter is wrongly addressed the country<br>needs to resend it back within three<br>months and the country is not like the<br>country that received the letter has to<br>pay for it is the sending continent pay<br>for it so if anything you would like the<br>gringos to pay for their mistake right<br>so so the Americans have to pay back for<br>the mailing okay so it's not like you<br>don't want to send because you don't<br>have resources okay so you can see this<br>is the kind of letter so we got for<br>example this was a this was you know we<br>picked all some names of economists okay<br>from the country okay and then we have a<br>friend that doesn't exist and you can<br>see that this is the address and then<br>you know this is what we had okay fine<br>so that it'll come out okay so we're<br>going to get into the link at quality of<br>education here also - so this is what<br>this is two countries for example and I<br>will promise I'll finish in five minutes<br>okay so this is - cause you've seen ten<br>letters to the Czech Republic which is<br>to be a fantastic country so you have<br>here we send the ten letters this is the<br>name of the guys the address the<br>postcode on the city when we send the<br>letter ok and when the letter came back<br>and this is the date of the limit when<br>we stop you know when malapa said okay<br>enough I cannot go to the post<br>anymore so you see that the Czech<br>Republic send all of the letters back<br>completely and all of the settings<br>within three months all of the letters<br>within three months which is what<br>everybody agreed on so they get so this<br>is the number of days in the last column<br>so within 52 days on average they send<br>all the runs back Russia okay so this is<br>the latest in Russia we got no letter<br>back in 420 18 days 20 days okay we've<br>got nodal back and then it was very<br>funny because I think a TV station were<br>ahold of this thing and then they ran a<br>TV show you know which had you know<br>grandma's babushkas crying that they<br>never got the male cats wrong this is<br>from the show in the TV you know TV<br>chain number one okay cats roaming<br>through the mail it in the letters and<br>so on and so forth so it was quite a<br>shock okay<br>so if you put all of the countries<br>together you know this is what you get<br>you get that on average okay if we had<br>we got about 59% of the letters back<br>okay about 35% of them came within three<br>months and the average time that it took<br>to get the letter back was 228 two days<br>okay now you can see that high-income<br>countries did a lot better because they<br>had 84% of the letters bad 60% within<br>three months and all it took them 125<br>days and after that it just falls out<br>for low-income countries okay you only<br>got a third of the layers back less than<br>10% of the letters within three months<br>and it took them three hundred and<br>thirty six days so there's an income<br>component and there is an educational<br>component because there are countries<br>with Bo education oh god you know only<br>46 percent of errors back in and 281<br>days okay now with all of this fantastic<br>day or whatever you may be using crappy<br>data or interesting data whatever what<br>explains you know we've we got the<br>letters back so we created these<br>variables which is productivity okay<br>which is there and we also have like<br>incredible data that you would never<br>think you would have liked because this<br>is guys in the post you know this is<br>called postal code convention they've<br>been collecting data of postal offices<br>since the 1970s I mean<br>is like an insane amount of data like we<br>know the number of letter boxes that<br>exist the number of staff the technology<br>of the sorting machine of the letter<br>that reads the letter and so on as<br>however you can say in the amount of<br>data that you can get out of these guys<br>so we have all of those variables which<br>are you know inputs for production and<br>then we put all of these measures which<br>have to do with education quality of<br>education okay and you can see that<br>controlling for everything else okay<br>measures that people associate with you<br>know some systems which have you know<br>higher managerial education if you will<br>for example his quality of management<br>skills which you have one that says<br>quality of law schools but it doesn't<br>get collected that much okay and<br>anything that has to do with management<br>practices which is you know better<br>monitoring practices you know managers<br>that set targets to their employees<br>managers that set incentives and so on<br>and so forth although they have only<br>been collected for about 20 countries<br>okay this was are both for wider<br>countries but they're very correlated<br>you can see that management quality kind<br>of like explains a lot of the<br>differences in productivity okay so when<br>you put that in regressions okay you can<br>see that controlling for everything else<br>you can see that you know the proportion<br>of those I will go back is much much<br>higher if you notice higher you know<br>management education as we can measure<br>it for this for this kind of like cross<br>country data okay so I mean so this says<br>that the quality may also come in okay<br>now I wish we had better measures of<br>that stuff okay so let me finish with<br>this so taking at face value okay you<br>know so I think that what would studies<br>institutions such as law matter but<br>they're not all I think education<br>matters quite a bit okay and it actually<br>explains a lot of the differences so if<br>you want to understand the differences<br>in variation of income across regions<br>you kind of need to get to human capital<br>if you want to understand the<br>differences in productivity across firms<br>you have to get to managerial education<br>and even for the differences in<br>productivity in governments okay there<br>is this you know manager<br>managerial component a manager education<br>turns out to be pretty good so maybe<br>some answer for New Zealand some<br>countries have very similar institutions<br>that they inherited through legal<br>transplantation some of them are<br>possibly not the best or some of them<br>are you think they are the best<br>but maybe okay there's something about<br>human capital that may explain something<br>now the puzzle of New Zealand may be<br>bigger because human capital is not so<br>low okay but I don't know about we know<br>human capital of managers okay so maybe<br>I don't know we should ask that to the<br>law school up to there to to the to the<br>business school<br>okay okay but it sounds that you know<br>people will write human capital okay<br>maybe detonators of productivity okay<br>but so I think this is where we're kind<br>of we are kind of going this may not be<br>very interesting but I think this is<br>where a sort of where we are okay good<br>thank you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
