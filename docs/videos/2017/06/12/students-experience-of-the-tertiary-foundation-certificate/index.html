font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I live high school and with the work to<br>look after my grandfather when my<br>grandfather died he ordered me to be a<br>better man and he wanted me to get an<br>education and got directed towards the<br>TFC I applied for Texas because at that<br>time it's been a while that I finished<br>my high school and I still wanted to<br>continue the study I applied to TSA<br>because when I came from England my<br>a-levels didn't quite match up with what<br>was required for studying health<br>sciences here I was very few G and I've<br>ever thought my academic transcript from<br>my country they had to do TSE two Kean<br>University qualification to enter<br>mainstream culture<br>I've been working for a couple of years<br>needed to get back into academic study<br>and I don't have university entrance<br>chemistry and biology were very<br>interesting subjects I had never taken<br>them in high school taking them here and<br>learning them in quite vast lectures<br>with someone who has dedicated their<br>life to that subject you know it really<br>fuels your own passion I started I'm<br>English math chemistry and biology so<br>we're really different to how I got<br>taught during high school areas<br>obviously it's more like university<br>style so the students and have a choice<br>of eight courses that they go into<br>either science or arts and science they<br>can study chemistry biology and physics<br>and maths and English are compulsory and<br>in arts they have the choice of history<br>and geography and there's also a general<br>arts courses Institute all of those<br>courses aim to introduce students to the<br>basic academic skills that they need to<br>study at University and also given the<br>content relevant content that will help<br>I thought it was going to be a lot more<br>heart out than it is but it definitely<br>it wasn't there it was a lot more<br>welcoming than what it seemed like it<br>was going to be and even the tutors and<br>everything like now that I'm in my first<br>year you can see the difference how much<br>it transitions you I wasn't quite sure<br>what to expect but it was almost like<br>high school but in the university<br>settings I thought it was just going to<br>be one year of intense study and then<br>getting a degree but I mean more than<br>that I think I've learned a lot about<br>myself I learned that I could do much<br>more than I thought because I thought I<br>just come to uni maybe do and that's<br>agree but I ended up realizing I could<br>do more why and go and do all these<br>other things much more than I was<br>expecting and I made a lot of good<br>friends but have to be independence<br>academically your lecturers will look<br>after your real teachers but only if you<br>look after yourself do you seem really<br>gives you the skills to use all of the<br>resources that you need you learned that<br>there sls workshops which calculus<br>English writing pen burner and twosies<br>can help you internet you've got<br>specific courses where you have to go<br>and use the library resources which<br>extremely helpful for first year they<br>teach you a lot of the basic skills of<br>essay writing and how distraction into<br>things which is really good for<br>to me challenging part was filling with<br>the stress but I learned how to manage<br>my time and doing multitasking like<br>juggling in schools around one of the<br>biggest challenges that I faced and TFC<br>was the first assignment season and I<br>meant to mr. test and in your first<br>round of exams I wasn't really prepared<br>for this kind of learning I think that<br>the biggest challenge would be<br>socializing because I'm new to the<br>country and I think that every<br>international student in my Korean and<br>receive you they do you have a theory of<br>socialising I think that I just overcome<br>that issue by making more friends and I<br>was engaging with more cultural<br>activities the final days we need it<br>just gets annoying families of in you're<br>together because you know how hard is<br>what to do here you've all been through<br>something that's made you all come to to<br>see we finally see that you've done it<br>and it you've all made it together<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
