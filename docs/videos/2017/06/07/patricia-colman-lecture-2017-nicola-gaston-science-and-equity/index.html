Equity.<br><br>Nicola discusses why persistent gender inequalities in science, and academic in general, must be taken seriously.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening um my name is associate<br>professor Sarah wakes um I'd like to<br>welcome you to the Patricia Coleman<br>lecture<br>2017 um as the chair of the board of um<br>studies of applied science Patricia<br>Coleman lecture is held in tribute to<br>the work in interests of the late<br>Emeritus Professor Patricia Coleman in<br>recognition of her contributions to<br>education University of atago and the<br>New Zealand community the Patricia<br>Coleman public lecture has been held<br>since 1987 and we are honored that<br>Nicola Gaston has been has accepted the<br>invitation to be the Patricia Coleman<br>speaker for<br>2017 the lecture is on topics that<br>relate to Patricia Coleman's interests<br>she had many wide ranging interests and<br>the topic science and Equity would be of<br>particular interest to a woman who once<br>attended a black TI University event<br>resplendant in evening attire and the<br>suggested black tie<br>science and Equity were themes Central<br>to her life's<br>work from<br>1911 onwards both from the school of<br>Home Sciences in denen and through the<br>distance teaching Network women<br>tirelessly transformed the health and<br>lives of new zealanders through the<br>sharing of scientific knowledge related<br>to microbiology human nutrition Anatomy<br>histology chemistry and so much<br>more in 2012 the success to home<br>Sciences consumer and applied sciences<br>was transformed once again to merge and<br>form the new applied science program<br>hence uh me being here to introduce you<br>with over a hundred years of women and<br>science at the University of atago<br>Science and Equity remains an important<br>issue so I'd like to introduce our<br>speaker Nicola Gaston she's associate<br>professor in physics at the University<br>of ockland and deputy director of The<br>mcdermut Institute for Advanced<br>Materials and nanotechnology a New<br>Zealand Center of research Excellence as<br>a principal investigator in The<br>Institute her group has worked<br>extensively on quantum mechanical<br>simulations of the melting behavior of<br>metal nanop particles which has<br>developed our understanding of how the<br>fundamental properties of materials<br>change as they become nanor structured<br>Nicola was uh the 2016 awarde of the<br>cmmse prize for contributions in the<br>field of computational chemistry in<br>particular for her work on the<br>properties of atomic clusters she was<br>president of the New Zealand Association<br>of scientists uh in 2014 to 15 and is<br>the author of why science is sexist<br>published by Bridget Williams books in<br>2015 and tonight she is the Patricia<br>well thank you for having me um it's<br>really an honor to be here um it's a<br>huge privilege and I'm quite excited by<br>the opportunity to talk about something<br>which is very dear to my heart so<br>science and Equity but in a context that<br>maybe allows me to broaden out my take<br>on this my perspective on this from what<br>I normally talk about which is usually<br>focused quite particularly on gender and<br>um I think find that that's still a<br>common theme in a lot of what I'm<br>talking about tonight uh the experiences<br>of women in science but what I'm hoping<br>to do and what I hope I've I've been<br>able to do is is broaden that out to<br>consider how we deal with Equity more<br>generally in science and why it might be<br>something that we need to concern<br>ourselves<br>with oh I can presumably I'm not sure if<br>it's a control on here I might leave<br>this<br>should I is that better Perfect all<br>right thank you to my delightful<br>assistant very very helpful um<br>so it was interesting to be asked to<br>give this because I've never heard of<br>Patricia Coleman um and I did do a<br>little bit of Googling and I usually uh<br>rate my skills as somebody who can get<br>on the internet and find things out um<br>but it turns out she's quite a hard<br>person person to find things out about<br>um but I was sent some information which<br>was wonderful to to provide a bit of<br>context to what I'm talking about and so<br>I have these two pictures appear um both<br>of which I think are lovely she looks<br>very serious and quite determined um as<br>a as a woman um a woman who knows in<br>mind I think and um what's what's clear<br>is that she made a a very large<br>contribution to what was in the Home<br>Science um<br>uh uh faculty uh being deemed for close<br>to 25 years I think that is so um really<br>quite a a significant figure in the<br>history of the University would think<br>and uh it might be that in addition to<br>having a lecture named in her honor that<br>she needs a little bit more prominence<br>um and recognition online since I I<br>struggle to find out very much about<br>here um and there's something in that<br>around science and the the Min of<br>science perhaps and the the prominence<br>of women in science um which inspires<br>some of what I'm going to say tonight so<br>I've I've talked about women in science<br>in a few different fora at this point um<br>and the title of the book that I wrote<br>on the subject was why science is sexist<br>and that<br>always it causes some concern in some<br>audiences that sexist is quite a strong<br>word to be throwing around casually<br>perhaps um but I I like to cite my<br>sources and there is a a nature um<br>actually a whole issue of nature from<br>2014 which I would use as my Citation<br>for the particular claim that science is<br>sexist uh the the initial statement<br>being here that science remains<br>institutionally sexist and what we mean<br>by that institutionally sexist is that<br>while we might not know all the causes<br>we might not know all the mechanisms by<br>which disproportionate gender<br>representation comes about uh we do know<br>what the status quo is we do know what<br>the current representation of men and<br>women is in the Sciences uh across<br>different forms of Science and at<br>different levels of seniority in science<br>and on that basis actually it's it's<br>perfectly valid to say that science is<br>um institutionally sexist and question I<br>became very interested in is why um so<br>I'm going to talk to you a little bit<br>about that and then talk a little bit<br>more about themes of equity in<br>general so women are under represented<br>in science that's a very straightforward<br>thing to say um it does depend a little<br>bit on what level of seniority you're<br>looking at this is referred to sometimes<br>as a scissor plot uh because you start<br>from high school level where more or<br>less I construction the um uh relative<br>representation of men and women is uh<br>Equitable and then as um people progress<br>through their lives through their<br>careers there is a u division of the<br>ways a parting of the ways if you like<br>in terms of outcomes um from a bachelor<br>level study all the way through to uh<br>top academic positions which is um where<br>this is a plot usually ends I quite like<br>the version because it goes all the way<br>to Nobel prizes where the the<br>discrepancy is quite um<br>stunning and so this is um often<br>referred to as a problem um it is a<br>problem in some sense but it's also uh<br>something that's quite interesting for<br>us to unpick and understand what's going<br>on<br>here uh so this is small plug for my<br>book I actually won't won't stick on um<br>won't won't dwell on this at all just um<br>I guess as a as a a a presentation of<br>where I'm coming from that that is<br>something I've written um but the reason<br>I wrote that was actually based on<br>personal experience not so much of<br>sexism directed at me and I reasonably<br>clear about that in the book but but<br>just an an environment in which strange<br>things seem to happen um from time to<br>time and so this uh is an invitation I<br>was sent uh by my h department when I<br>was working as a research scientist at<br>IRL or Industrial Research limited which<br>used to be one of the Cris or crown<br>research institutes in New Zealand and I<br>worked there for about five years and<br>close to the end of that fiveyear period<br>I was sent this invitation um you can<br>see it's to an event at gns science gns<br>is also one of the<br>Cris um it's supported by the Royal<br>Society of New Zealand it involves a<br>1-hour um session from D McCarthy who<br>was the chief executive of the Royal<br>Society of New<br>Zealand but<br>notably it also included a two-hour<br>session on how to dress to<br>influence right so the takeaway from<br>this is that not just that you might<br>want to learn how to dress to influence<br>but that the problem as demonstrated by<br>that scissor part that the underlying<br>cause the hypothesis suggested by this<br>invitation is that the underlying cause<br>and problem is that women don't know how<br>to dress<br>properly and not just don't know how to<br>dress properly but don't know how to<br>address to<br>influence right and there's something<br>very um it's not even that subtle in<br>there it's something that suggests that<br>women don't have power and should always<br>be influencing those who have power<br>rather than actually trying to make<br>decisions so this was well it's<br>something I've thought about quite a lot<br>since quite how these um misconceptions<br>come about and how much<br>damage poor messaging about Equity can<br>do so you can imagine receiving this as<br>a young woman that it sends a signal<br>which is really quite counterproductive<br>let's say um and I've learned a lot<br>since then about similar messaging when<br>we target say Mar and Pacifica<br>communities who tend to be even much<br>worse<br>um represented in in in science let's<br>say and it's it's very very important<br>that we be conscious of the way that we<br>we send messages um to groups that we<br>might be um honestly concerned about for<br>good reason but um that we might be<br>sending the wrong signals to so that's<br>one of the one of the key takeaways uh<br>that I learned from this<br>experience there are<br>unfortunately quite a number of examples<br>of this same sort of thing so this is a<br>still from a um video that was put<br>together by the European commission to<br>encourage girls into science because of<br>the scissor plot um which also<br>demonstrates something called The Leaky<br>pipeline where there's sort of a a<br>conceptual pipeline from undergraduate<br>study through to seniority out of which<br>women are seen as the things that leak<br>um in order to correct that the the idea<br>is that you have to get more girls into<br>into studying science that somehow they<br>don't stick it out because they don't<br>like it enough or or there just aren't<br>enough of them to begin with and what<br>was interesting about this particular<br>initiative is not just the video itself<br>which involved these these young women<br>dancing around dressed up rather smartly<br>uh wearing lab glasses and lipstick at<br>the same time um but the backlash to<br>this video which was very strongly um<br>strongly<br>uh um definite I suppose that that<br>science and femininity or science and<br>lipstick do not go together and there's<br>a problem in that just as much as<br>there's a problem in saying that girls<br>need to have symbolism around lipstick<br>in order to be attracted into science<br>and there's in both cases it's it's kind<br>of problematic um and so some of these<br>messages some of these campaigns that<br>are very well intentioned<br>can do damage because people are sending<br>the wrong signals about what's actually<br>important um there's another more recent<br>one this is from only about a year ago<br>uh IBM decided that they need more women<br>in engineering of course and the way to<br>get more women into engineering is to<br>have a campaign about how to hack a hair<br>dryer how to you use a hairdyer in order<br>to do scientific research of some sort<br>and so they um put a video together<br>which you can still find online about<br>you know hecking a hair dryer and doing<br>interesting stuff with it<br>um again<br>it's I would say both the initial video<br>but some of the um some of the emphasis<br>of the response to it some of the<br>rejection of the messages in the video<br>both of these things are a bit<br>problematic and they show some of the<br>the issues that we have about believing<br>that science or scientific discovery and<br>being a woman are not comp<br>things right and so I have this example<br>up because it's one of the first<br>examples that I saw that really hammered<br>this point home for me um<br>about uh the messaging mattering and<br>that actually the only way to get past<br>this is for people to understand the<br>root causes of the problem and so this<br>is from a presentation by uh Larry<br>Summers who is an economist who was the<br>president of Harvard at the time that he<br>gave this um this uh lecture and I I<br>always leave this preludin because I<br>think it's important to recognize that<br>he said explicitly when he gave the talk<br>that he was there to provoke and he'd<br>only um agreed to give this talk on the<br>basis that he could be provocative and<br>then he goes to say that um on many many<br>human different uh human different human<br>attributes height weight propensity for<br>criminality overall IQ mathematical<br>ability scientific ability um let's not<br>worry about the difference in averages<br>but there's a difference in the<br>variability between male populations and<br>female populations and so when he he<br>says this what he's doing is referring<br>to some sort of um he's referring to<br>sort of a scientific way of of thinking<br>about things that that's the reference<br>to the population and the variability<br>particular when he's talking about<br>standard deviations um but the the key<br>message is that actually if the the<br>variability of a male population is<br>greater that means there will be more<br>very smart men and more very stupid men<br>that's basically the idea and because<br>what we're seeing at the top end at the<br>far end of the scissor plot is who makes<br>it all the way through it's the the top<br>Achievers if you like um that that could<br>be explained by a hypothesis such as<br>this now I don't want to overemphasize<br>this particular speech except that it is<br>something that stuck around in the<br>literature quite a lot and I think it's<br>important to actually look at something<br>like this and be prepared to say<br>actually there's some pseudo science in<br>here he's comparing things like height<br>and weight which are nicely measurable<br>quantities with things like um<br>scientific ability mathematical ability<br>propensity for criminality whatever that<br>is which are measured in in very<br>different ways which can't really be<br>disentangled from different causes and<br>then he's talking about something like<br>IQ which is measurable but not really<br>representative of what you think it's<br>representative of if you think it's um<br>an objective identifier of intelligence<br>so there there are quite a few issues<br>I'd have as a scientist just with this<br>message of which conflates a whole lot<br>of things which are not at all<br>comparable um so that's my my response<br>to Larry Summers um this is a a little<br>still from Fargo some of you may have<br>seen some of you may not have um yeah<br>it's just it's just not quite right in<br>the messaging itself um it also turns<br>out it's not supported by the<br>literature uh the biggest predictor of<br>gender differences in performance on<br>math tests for example is simply the<br>extent of um emancipation or Liberation<br>or equality for women in the country<br>where those measurements or or exams are<br>being performed so uh it's it's very<br>very very clear that there are cultural<br>influences<br>which affect gender differences what can<br>be measured um in scientific disciplines<br>and in mathematics and whenever<br>anybody's looked for biological<br>differences for biologically determined<br>differences um the literature is has<br>basically um diminished uh over time uh<br>there were some studies uh originally<br>which showed a few a few minor<br>discrepancies but most of those have now<br>gone over time and so the study that I<br>often refer to in the context of science<br>where uh which does actually start to<br>provide a first explanation of what's<br>going on is this particular study from<br>2014 so it's not that old um which is no<br>2014<br>2012 uh which is entitled as you can<br>read science faculty's subtle gender<br>biases favor male students and in<br>retrospect it's kind of surprising to me<br>that this study got as much attention as<br>it did um on the other hand it came out<br>around about the same month that I got<br>that HR invitation that was going to<br>teach me to dress properly so it it<br>struck me certainly at the time and I<br>remember going through it and thinking<br>well huh there's something in this and<br>there's something in this that people<br>need to know about so that was really<br>where my interest came I I um put a talk<br>together based on this paper and a<br>little bit based on the HR invitation<br>that I'd had and I I gave it at my at my<br>workplace what does this paper actually<br>show well what it does is it takes a CV<br>for an applicant for a research um<br>assistant or a laboratory manager rather<br>in a in in a scientific discipline uh<br>between physics chemistry and biology<br>that CV is sent to academics in the<br>United States at a range of different<br>institutions<br>they asked to evaluate the CV for the<br>competence the hireability of the<br>candidate um whether or not they'd be<br>willing to Mentor the person described<br>by the CV and they're also asked to<br>nominate a salary that they would offer<br>that person so they seems<br>straightforward the<br>only complicating factor is that the<br>name at the top of the CV was changed<br>from Jennifer to<br>John<br>randomly and based on the gender<br>associated with the name at the top of<br>the<br>CV uh the competence and hirability and<br>mentoring scores all differed<br>significantly right um so this showed a<br>clear bias um for the male candidate<br>based on nothing other than than that<br>gender um and this is a plot that shows<br>the salary difference that was offered<br>to the male and the female candidate I'm<br>very sorry because I know that many of<br>you the audience will object to the fact<br>that the y- axis doesn't go to zero the<br>difference between the two is only about<br>12% but that is around the the scale of<br>the gender pay gap which is maybe useful<br>to keep in<br>um I worry at times not only that the<br>messaging is wrong because we don't<br>understand the root causes of inequity<br>but that some of the solutions that are<br>proposed actually do damage by<br>um well as as summarized by The Onion um<br>inspiring girls to earn less than men in<br>Scientific careers um this is supposed<br>to be satire it hits a little too close<br>to home for<br>me one thing that's really important<br>about this particular study is that the<br>academics involved with both women and<br>men and what that tells us is the<br>unconscious bias is something that we<br>all have so if you're interested in<br>actually understanding what this looks<br>like like or how this can be measured uh<br>you can go and do the implicit bias test<br>which is um something uh from Harvard<br>that's online it's very easy to find if<br>you just Google and so this is the<br>result that I get if I go in and um<br>basically just tap the keyboard to<br>indicate an association yes of these<br>words do these belong together or do<br>they not belong together and my data<br>suggest not very surprisingly that I'm<br>biased<br>um I could do the test again I know how<br>it works now I could probably improve my<br>score that's not the point the point is<br>not to do that well the point is to<br>understand that these associations are<br>cultural we all live with them we all<br>have them and that's why we need to<br>acknowledge them in order to to do<br>better unfortunately in science these<br>things these these initial biases around<br>just you know competence translate into<br>biases and all sorts of other metrics<br>and measurements that we used to<br>evaluate how people do um how good they<br>are which which seems like a thing that<br>it should be possible to measure simply<br>but it turns out it's quite complicated<br>so this is a particular study which<br>looks at the association of publication<br>topic with<br>gender um as evaluated by the<br>participants in the study they assigned<br>some topics to be male typed and some<br>topics to be female typed and some they<br>say oh these are more or less in the<br>middle<br>and what happens is that it turns out<br>that if a topic is male typed um there<br>is a considerable penalty for women<br>publishing in that area but the<br>evaluation of publication quality<br>decreases<br>significantly on the other hand if<br>something is female typed there's a<br>slight penalty for men but it's much<br>much smaller and if something is gender<br>neutral it turns<br>out good this is probably a<br>a validation of the assignment of those<br>topics as gender neutral it doesn't<br>matter if you're a man or a woman all<br>right um this is uh a followup to that<br>which is the uh ratings of interest in<br>collaborating with those people based on<br>the quality of the publication and the<br>gender uh as shown in the previous spot<br>and again uh you see more or less the<br>same thing women pay a penalty for<br>trying to compete in male Hep um<br>disciplines<br>when it comes to publication and Science<br>and in Academia in general has become<br>much more of a standard problem for all<br>of us but in science it's perhaps more<br>acute um the order of publication is<br>tricky and I I actually refer to this<br>particular study because of this uh<br>quote which I think is really important<br>because what it it it um it clarifies to<br>me is again this this message of how it<br>matters how we talk about these things<br>and how um the the idea that women<br>choose to leave science and that because<br>it's a choice that's okay is something<br>that really doesn't sit well with me<br>anymore um based on these kinds of these<br>kinds of<br>statements um the the self-doubting<br>aspect of of what women report about why<br>they leave science it's it's it's very<br>very<br>uncomfortable so um male scientists<br>publish more more than female scientists<br>it turns out um the the types of<br>authorship whether you're the most<br>senior author on the paper or not and<br>how much credit you therefore get for<br>the work uh that varies quite<br>significantly some of this is probably<br>just the Leaky pipeline the fact that<br>women are not getting through to levels<br>of seniority but there's a there's a<br>there's a chicken and egg situation<br>there is it that they're not getting<br>through because they're not getting the<br>credit or is it that they are um not<br>getting the credit and therefore not<br>getting<br>through there are other things that seem<br>to affect Publications men site<br>themselves a lot more than women that's<br>one thing that's been fairly clearly uh<br>demonstrated to be true um okay that's a<br>behavioral difference um on the other<br>hand this is a really recent study this<br>just came out um I think I saw a review<br>of it in science just two weeks ago<br>maybe and what they looked at is first<br>year PhD<br>students where those first year PhD<br>students are typically not the first<br>author they haven't done the most work<br>and written the paper and they're<br>certainly not the senior author or the<br>one at the end um so they're probably in<br>the middle and what that means is that<br>whether or not their name goes on the<br>paper is largely up to their<br>supervisor it's a judgment call have<br>they done enough work in support of the<br>first author as part of a team to be<br>credited with application or not and<br>this is something that you would think<br>be Equitable but it might be that<br>actually it's not um one thing that the<br>authors looked at very carefully is how<br>much experience the students had coming<br>into their PHD how much confidence they<br>had in their research skills so whether<br>that was influencing the likelihood of<br>them getting credit it and they were<br>able to make a very strong statement<br>that that was simply not<br>happening uh and the outcome of the<br>study is simply that for a given amount<br>of time spent on<br>Research men male students were 15% more<br>likely to be credited with<br>authorship and so there's there's<br>something there about social dynamics in<br>the laboratory and research groups that<br>about so what bothers me a bit um<br>when we talk about science and Equity is<br>is The Stereotype of what a scientist is<br>so these are just the first few images<br>that popped up when I first gave a talk<br>about this and I just Google image<br>searched what a scientist is up pop<br>these things and so when you're thinking<br>about where the unconscious biases come<br>from that I'm talking about it's<br>actually not that hard to see this is a<br>reasonably good reflection of them um<br>what was disappointing at the time was<br>that this was the first picture of a<br>all right there are many other things<br>I'm going to gloss over a few of these<br>but one of the ones I want to touch on<br>is the student evaluations problem<br>because this is teaching related rather<br>than research related and the way<br>University careers work a lot of the<br>time we think that teaching might be or<br>teaching is perhaps let's say that<br>another way teaching roles are perhaps<br>where women tend to end up a little bit<br>more and so you might think that they<br>would get more credit for being good<br>teachers because that at least would<br>explain why more of them turn up in<br>teaching roles turns out that according<br>to student evaluations this is not the<br>case and one particular question uh the<br>idea of promptness in returning work to<br>students um on a fiveo scale women<br>scored a whole point worse than men in<br>this particular study so this was done<br>for a um a a course taught uh remotely<br>over the Internet half the students<br>thought they had a male um instructor<br>half of them thought they had a female<br>instructor all of them um actually half<br>I'll say that differently um of the ones<br>who thought they had a male instructor<br>half of them actually did and half of<br>them had the woman and vice versa in the<br>other way and so what this actually<br>hammers home is this point about<br>promptness is that actually there's<br>something that we would possibly refer<br>to as a benevolent a kind kind of<br>stereotype about women women being<br>caring wom being um more likely to give<br>you attention perhaps uh these kinds of<br>stereotypes what we sometimes think of<br>as as relatively benevolent ways of<br>thinking about the differences between<br>men and women about thinking about<br>gender stereotypes um actually are not<br>as benevolent as we might<br>think so and it gets worse from there um<br>there's this study which um this<br>occasion uh about 18 months ago<br>uh<br>where uh a uh a a journal article was<br>reviewed and the review was sent back uh<br>by the editor to the um authors and uh<br>the the comments were that a male author<br>needed to be added to the paper to<br>counteract the evident bias um the lack<br>of objectivity of the two young women<br>who were writing the article<br>um which is uh kind of an interesting<br>thing so there there's an increasing set<br>of data I suppose on both incidents but<br>also on mechanisms and structures that<br>enable inequity to persist on the basis<br>that it already exists and our<br>inclination as human beings is to think<br>that what exists is what is natural and<br>it must be that way for a reason um it<br>is that way for a reason but that's<br>historical inequity that was kind of<br>should have thought we've gotten past by<br>now so I I put a little poem in at this<br>point um again just to to reiterate what<br>I've already said about how it matters<br>how we have this conversation because<br>there's a problem when you're talking<br>about gender in particular um if it's a<br>conversation in which men get to be<br>objective and women don't right so the<br>poem is goes like this he tells her that<br>the Earth is flat he knows the facts and<br>that is that an altercation Fierce and<br>long she tries her best to prove him<br>wrong but he has learned to argue well<br>he calls her arguments unsound and often<br>asks her not to yell she cannot win he<br>stands his ground the planet goes on<br>being<br>round and when you look at the very<br>pointy end of where Equity affects<br>people's careers and people's lives it's<br>often at the very junior level of<br>achievement uh in Academia and there are<br>a lot of what is happening is um a lot<br>of where we see the Leaky pipeline is<br>where women are leaving um research<br>around the time that they start a family<br>because things just get too hard um and<br>what's interesting is that there's been<br>a a push to create mechanisms and<br>research funding and other um in in<br>other places uh that there's a a concept<br>of relative to opportunity that if you<br>have had time out of the workforce that<br>needs to be accounted for and<br>unfortunately it feels like that's<br>that's a little bit of a joke that gets<br>played on people it's not actually taken<br>as seriously as it should<br>be<br>so in that original study that I showed<br>you the CV with the two names John and<br>Jennifer uh one of the hypotheses that<br>was uh suggested by the authors was that<br>um they needed to do the study on<br>scientists despite the fact that these<br>kinds of unconscious biases have been<br>demonstrated in many many many studies<br>um because scientists might somehow be<br>more objective than the average<br>person right<br>and you've already seen the results so<br>we know that this is a hypothesis that<br>was proved to not be correct um we might<br>think of objectivity as a virtue in<br>science it might be something that we<br>Aspire uh for our research outcomes to<br>be but that doesn't mean that we are<br>objective um no no more than any body<br>else and yet objectivity in science is<br>really really important so I've thrown<br>up a couple of definitions here one from<br>Wikipedia um it's something really<br>fundamental to what scientific truth is<br>if something is scientifically true it<br>should be some kind of objective<br>reality<br>um but the<br>second definition is maybe slightly<br>better in the sense that it it looks<br>about it look it talks about the<br>scientific method and results and what<br>makes scientists objective let's say is<br>that we don't just produce our results<br>and let them sit there um forever we<br>expect and hope and um sometimes<br>convince somebody else to go and<br>reproduce the work that we've done to<br>demonstrate that it is um something that<br>is true in more in in more than one set<br>of<br>experiments all right<br>um but objectivity is really important<br>in this whole conversation about Equity<br>because there is it crops up in<br>different places there's this problem of<br>um who gets to be objective um but<br>there's also a problem of if we consider<br>ourselves objective how does that affect<br>how we make<br>decisions so this is a study um which is<br>a little bit like the CV study I showed<br>you before that where there's a male um<br>CV and a female CV but there are<br>actually two CVS and they are different<br>one of them is a more educated candidate<br>and the other is a more experienced<br>candidate these are CVS um in for the<br>job of of police<br>chief and what's interesting is that<br>depending on whether the person is more<br>educated or more<br>experienced well that actually doesn't<br>affect the choice what matters much more<br>is just the gender at the top of the<br>CV right but there is a silver lining<br>and this is I like this part because<br>that's it's a littleit bit of a a clue<br>as to how we can do things better if<br>you're asked to to commit to some<br>criteria for choosing one of the CVS<br>beforehand that effect goes away if you<br>asked actually say well is education<br>more important or experience what am I<br>looking for in the CV then it turns out<br>we can do that but the really<br>interesting thing is that that level of<br>bias that's shown in that in that study<br>depends strongly on how objective you<br>perceive yourself to be and this may<br>seem counterintuitive but it turns out<br>if you think you're very objective<br>you're more likely to just be relying on<br>your unconscious biases whereas if you<br>are aware that you might not be that<br>objective of person you might be more<br>likely to look at the criteria that<br>you're using to decide which CV you<br>prefer and so objectivity is a little<br>bit of a problem at the heart of<br>scientific culture I think um and so<br>when we talk about Equity when we talk<br>about women in science or when we talk<br>about M and Pacifica in science or when<br>we talk about other marginalized groups<br>in<br>science who is we it's it's somehow a<br>thing that we need to disentangle we<br>need to think a lot more about being<br>inclusive about how we have these<br>conversations and not just portraying<br>the same old faces the Einstein and the<br>radfords and even the Mary cures as<br>being representative of who scientists<br>are and there are few a few um issues<br>that have cropped up in the last few<br>years that really demonstrate that this<br>is still a problem so these great<br>figures of science are more or less<br>epitomized by Nobel Prize winners let's<br>say and so there was this issue with Tim<br>Hunt in the UK a couple of years ago<br>which spawned this distractingly sexy<br>hashtag because he he made this comment<br>to a room full of uh journalists that<br>you know women are distractingly sexy<br>they cry in the lab um as it's difficult<br>to have them around and this is um a<br>quote from actually a separate interview<br>and he's you know he he just doesn't<br>really get the issue and I'm not going<br>to say he's a dreadful person for not<br>getting the issue what I'm going to say<br>is that the respect that we give people<br>as Nobel Prize winners can be somewhat<br>limited to their scientific achievements<br>we don't necessarily need to give them a<br>platform to talk about Equity or gender<br>issues if they know nothing about it<br>that's that's really what I'm saying um<br>they're not magic Medals of<br>blamelessness this is a nice a nice it<br>was put by someone called macki Naro<br>who's a<br>um comic um writer and and what I think<br>we're allowed to do is criticize<br>people's actions without saying that the<br>person themselves is a problem we can<br>just say they might not understand this<br>issue they're not the best person to be<br>talking about it maybe their opinion on<br>gender is not significant<br>what's worrisome when these issues crop<br>up is how much backlash there is towards<br>um trying to deal with equity and I<br>think this is something that we all need<br>to be aware of when we're talking about<br>the subject that's yet another example<br>of why how we talk about it matters um I<br>won't dwell on this um but no I won't I<br>won't dwell on this um there's a quite<br>lovely essay on the topic that I do<br>recommend though at the link here which<br>you can you can find reasonably easily<br>The Rage of a scholarship student in an<br>elite school and it it covers this idea<br>of objectivity and the fact that it's<br>something that people have because of<br>their own<br>privilege right we practice this<br>objectivity at University the best<br>person to talk about wealth in class was<br>an upper middle class person because she<br>supposedly could look at it just<br>passionately the best person to talk<br>about race was a white person for the<br>same reason reasons the best person to<br>talk about gender was a boy um so who is<br>it that gets to be objective I quite<br>like this little um cartoon of a<br>rationalist um my objective logic proves<br>what men objectively deserve everything<br>we have because we're so super objective<br>it feels like that's sometimes um the<br>perspective that I get from white men<br>I'll say but I've learned to worry much<br>more that when I talk about race issues<br>for example that I'm projecting the same<br>kinds of things and I think we all need<br>to be very conscious of<br>this right so this is a picture one of<br>the few pictures I found when I was<br>looking um for Patricia Coleman on the<br>internet uh so these are some students<br>from the school of Home Science<br>1920 and it's quite a nice picture<br>they're looking rather happy it's a<br>little bit disturbing that this isn't a<br>picture of them actually studying this<br>is a picture of them in the kitchen at<br>the um at their residence that's one of<br>the one of the few pictures I could find<br>but yeah and so what I want to reflect<br>on given the context of this lecture is<br>what the origin is of different levels<br>of inequity say in different forms of<br>science different kinds of science um<br>and so this is looking at the percentage<br>of bachelor's degrees compared to women<br>in the United States by topic by subject<br>area and I think all I'm really going to<br>say is that increased over time but<br>there are big differences between<br>different fields and that's one of the<br>things that we need to understand in<br>order to judge whether what we<br>understand about um gender and science<br>is<br>is whether it STS up um but it turns out<br>there a rather nice study that has<br>looked at this already so this is just<br>from 2015 I think yes expectations of<br>Brilliance there's underlied gend gender<br>distributions across academic<br>disciplines what does that mean<br>well the participants in the study are<br>asked to say whether they think that<br>Talent is what determin success in their<br>field or whether it's actually about<br>hard work and it turns out there's quite<br>a Divergence of opinion about that issue<br>and it also turns out that different<br>disciplines kind of have different<br>cultures that different levels of belief<br>in this<br>idea so on the left hand side if we just<br>concentrate on those two plots the top<br>to one is for scientific subjects and<br>the bottom one is for<br>humanities and on the left hand side we<br>have um disciplines that believe that<br>it's more about hard work and on the<br>right hand side of the plot we have<br>disciplines that believe that innate<br>Talent is something that is really<br>important for success and what you see<br>is that the gender equal disciplines are<br>things like educ ation social science um<br>psychology they're much more gendere<br>equal and they believe in the in value<br>of hard work whereas things like physics<br>and maths and philosophy are all at the<br>end of the spectrum where somehow it's<br>it's about the talent that you that you<br>bring to the subject that's what's<br>actually going to determine if you're<br>successful or not and the problem with<br>this I would think should be obvious to<br>anybody who's ever taught if you tell<br>your students that work doesn't matter<br>you're not going to be able to teach<br>them very well so there is something<br>really um really important about this<br>concept of insisting that hard work is<br>what matters and that is how you<br>undermine the stereotypes that lead to a<br>disproportionate number of men I think<br>on the right hand side there are two<br>different plots and these are looking at<br>ethnicity um so the top one where there<br>is a correlation is for<br>African-Americans uh getting their phds<br>in the United States uh the numbers are<br>much lower overall um as you can see but<br>there's some correlation the bottom one<br>is for Asian Americans and you see that<br>the stereotype is not so productive of<br>um of those kinds of<br>beliefs however in New Zealand of course<br>we have similar issues so this is um<br>from a study um an article an<br>investigation really carried out by a<br>reporter at the New Zealand heral Kirsty<br>Johnson uh last year which is really I<br>think rather uh worth a read and it<br>describes this idea that students go<br>into their classes at school even and<br>can be made to feel to belong or not<br>belong based on the subject that they're<br>walking into and so it describes this uh<br>experience of Amelia Anu walking into a<br>physics class um and being asked if she<br>was in the right place and she was the<br>only Brown kid in the<br>room these experiences translate into<br>numbers<br>only 10% of Pacifica students take ncea<br>level two physics 177% of students<br>nationally do so it's about half um at<br>dile one which is at the pointy end of<br>the spectrum only 3% of Marty take level<br>two physics right it's a total of 68<br>kids nationally and only half of them<br>pass so the numbers the numbers are<br>really bad but relating those numbers<br>back to the experiences of students and<br>understanding that their experiences<br>matter and that they're part of the<br>problem that's that's one of the really<br>important things that I think we need to<br>do physics in particular well I work<br>these days in the physics department<br>I've jumped around a bit in my career<br>I've been in a chemistry Department I've<br>been in a an applied maths Group which<br>is when I was working at Industrial<br>Research limited so I've been in a few<br>different places but physics is<br>definitely also at the pointy end of the<br>spectrum right so this is a plot which<br>looks at the percentage the cumulative<br>percentage of Nobel Prize<br>winners in physics I realized I hadn't<br>put that in the in the in the title um<br>who well woman and what I worry about<br>when we talk about how much things are<br>getting better is that actually we've<br>got this cumulative experience of a<br>century or so of scientific<br>investigation the history of which is<br>really common it's well captured it's in<br>all the textbooks it's easily googleable<br>we can find out all this information<br>about all these people and when I teach<br>I like to tell stories about the people<br>I'm I'm talking about um when Mary Cy<br>won the won the Nobel Prize 1903 he had<br>177% of the Nobel Prize winners in<br>physics being women um and the thing is<br>that we're now as bad as it's ever been<br>in a cumulative sense so when you think<br>about the historical weight of<br>representation<br>and how that affects how we think about<br>who belongs in science there's a sense<br>in which it's not actually getting<br>better I'll also throw up a couple of<br>examples um I found in a Solutions<br>manual or a problem set for for students<br>I haven't given these to students I<br>wouldn't do that um but there's this<br>stupid question about Adam and<br>Eve uh which has this initial answer<br>Adam because the man is always right now<br>none of the answers I've actually got up<br>here are the correct answer so don't<br>worry about that but just little things<br>like this in physics textbooks it tells<br>you something that something's wrong in<br>the culture that these things can slide<br>by for so long well there's this really<br>creepy one about a girl sitting in the<br>water and a boy looking up at their toes<br>and wanting to touch them<br>it's um yeah anyway not to be too mean<br>about physics but um so I joined the<br>physics department at Oakland about a<br>year ago and it was about three months<br>after my book came out and so I got I<br>had been contacted by a journalist and<br>she wanted to write about this and she<br>went off and she wrote about it and she<br>came back to me and she said here's the<br>thing but I want to run it past you<br>because it might be a bit awkward and<br>she started reading it out and she says<br>Richard Jeff J Stuart Neil Dennis Howard<br>and I don't know how many names she got<br>through but maybe half a dozen and I<br>knew exactly what she was doing which is<br>listing all the names of the academics<br>on the ockland physics department<br>website<br>and I said to her huh Jenny this is<br>interesting I said you might not know<br>but I'm going to be joining the physics<br>department at Oakland in a couple of<br>months and she said H um do you want me<br>to do you want me to take it out do you<br>think it's a bad intro and I said oh<br>well that's very effective it's a bit<br>awkward I don't know how people will<br>feel about it but I said no go ahead<br>it's what you've written and so it's<br>it's interesting it tells you something<br>about the small world nature of of<br>talking about these things um but there<br>is something else that I wanted to point<br>out to expand upon this particular point<br>that this piece is entitled the s word<br>which you might think just means science<br>or you might think it means sexism but<br>there's another word in here which is<br>really important which is status so the<br>relative status of different forms of<br>science the relative status of men and<br>women these things are are mixed up and<br>entangled the relative status of<br>different groups in society um status is<br>actually the thing that underlines<br>everything that we're talking about and<br>there is a bit of a an issue in that<br>when we talk about Equity um as a as a<br>big concept<br>Equity requires that some people improve<br>in status and some people lose status<br>and that makes it hard of course it<br>makes it hard but that doesn't mean that<br>we shouldn't do it uh the status of<br>science is something that does come<br>under pressure from time to time there's<br>the idea of a science March which is<br>happening in April um probably around<br>New Zealand and support of a science<br>March that's happening in the United<br>States in response to Trump and I've<br>written about this a little bit uh<br>because I do think it's very important<br>that we talk about why knowledge is<br>important why scientific knowledge is<br>important um but but it's interesting<br>because it does seem that one of the the<br>causes of defensiveness about equity in<br>science is the feeling of threat that<br>the status of science itself might be at<br>risk and I think we need to acknowledge<br>that as part of the conversation about<br>how we move<br>forward I thrw up a little uh example of<br>the kind of defensiveness that I've run<br>into since I started talking about this<br>this is a newspaper clipping that a<br>friend's mother um cut out of the Christ<br>Church press and provided to me uh which<br>I think is quite cute which is why it's<br>the one I use I've seen various things<br>that are quite similar and a lot of<br>people want to believe that this kind of<br>stuff is natural that the relative level<br>of representation is is there for a<br>reason because it's what has been true<br>their whole life and it's really hard to<br>acknowledge that sometimes things just<br>may have been wrong for a long time um<br>but I think there's no there's no other<br>way to make progress here this person is<br>talking about the relative difference in<br>brain size actually being the the cause<br>of the different performance of men and<br>women in science or they go on a little<br>bit of a rant about mating behavior<br>beforehand I don't think you need to<br>read it in particular um it's not that<br>original and one of the things that's<br>important to think about when you think<br>about the status of science is what it's<br>based on and this is a really old<br>conversation this goes back to CP snow<br>and his lecture book um the two cultures<br>which was something that came out in the<br>60s I think in the UK and he talks about<br>this um but in particular the comparison<br>between science and the humanities and<br>their relative status and I mentioned<br>this because I came down here originally<br>for a a panel discussion yesterday for<br>the love Humanities campaign of the tuu<br>because I think it's really important<br>that actually when we ascribe some<br>status to science we don't try and do it<br>at the cost of putting down other forms<br>of knowledge<br>when we ascribe some status to a<br>particular form of science say physics<br>we shouldn't do that by putting down<br>other forms of science there's no sense<br>in which that benefits any of us and so<br>he's it's it's a lecture worth reading<br>because he does talk about societal<br>forces and he talks very clearly and<br>very directly about the class system in<br>the UK at the time which is actually the<br>I I I would say the the two cultures<br>that he's talking about are actually um<br>the upper and lower classes or the upper<br>and middle classes more more directly in<br>the UK at the time rather than the<br>sciences and the humanities at<br>all so I've talked about Equity um and I<br>just want to to touch on this point that<br>Equity is not quite the same thing as<br>equality equality tends to be a legal<br>construct but men and women have the<br>same rights uh Equity is more about<br>outcomes it's more about whether<br>actually um yeah whether the the<br>potential for uh real um achievement is<br>is the same and so they've got two<br>different cartoons here which illustrate<br>the the equity problem perhaps that we<br>don't always start from the same um<br>starting point unconscious biases get in<br>the way for certain groups of people<br>more than for others um and some of<br>these things are invisible and some of<br>them aren't but um we need to keep in<br>mind we don't always know the kinds of<br>obstacles other people have had to<br>overcome so I thought I'd finish with a<br>few uh reading recommendations just not<br>my book in particular but things that<br>I've read that have have been really<br>influential delusions of gender is a<br>great one for just unpacking some of the<br>um literature that's out there The Men<br>Are from Mars Women Are from Venus type<br>things about the differences between men<br>and women most of it's rubbish um the<br>quote from John Stewart Mill I quite<br>like here because it it really describes<br>this um tendency to want to believe that<br>things are the way that they are for a<br>reason for good reason<br>and<br>unfortunately if<br>you if you look at how things happen and<br>the underlying causes and the mechanisms<br>by which um processes happen such as<br>career progression then you learn that<br>actually a lot of this is not<br>necessarily true there's a new book by<br>Cordelia so the same author as the<br>previous book delusions of gender this<br>is called testosterone Rex and it's<br>interesting to me because it's a<br>slightly punchier version of the first<br>book um which is really in response to<br>the fact that there's quite a lot that's<br>happened in popular culture which is<br>pushing back against Equity pushing back<br>against feminism um I'll mention<br>um uh the the title that's supposed to<br>be here's why there ought to be a cap on<br>women studying science and maths uh this<br>is an article from Breitbart media and<br>some of you may know that um one of the<br>Trump administration's uh team is the<br>head of right Bart media and they pushed<br>this kind of message um which<br>is largely based in the idea that<br>actually um men have somehow being<br>emasculated by feminism and uh yeah and<br>that that's really where the idea of<br>testosterone Rex comes from that<br>Cordelia fine is unpacking in her latest<br>book which has just very recently come<br>out so I want to finish um with a little<br>bit of a reflection on my own research<br>if I can um and this is in response to<br>some things about scientific culture<br>that bother me um still so there's this<br>uh statement from Steven Hawking um just<br>late last year which was uh basically a<br>prediction that we've got about a<br>thousand years to find a new place to<br>live he reckons because the planet's<br>going to be exhausted something's going<br>to go wrong we're going to to you know<br>civilization will collapse<br>catastrophically between now and then<br>and it's gone with a thousand years so<br>there's a decent chance he's right I<br>don't know but that's not really the<br>point um the point is that maybe we do<br>have a lot of challenges but the<br>solutions that we come up with as<br>scientists and as human beings they<br>depend on our perspectives they depend<br>on our experiences and so he's come up<br>with this idea that we have to leave the<br>planet and this is a a concept that's<br>deeply entangled in scientific or<br>science fiction culture if you like um<br>and so this is moving into Stellar where<br>there's this quote uh we're not meant to<br>save the world we're meant to leave it<br>it's all very very dark when you start<br>to think about it that that's somehow<br>the solution um the end of Earth will<br>not be the end of us it says well this<br>this this moment it's it's like we've<br>forgotten who we are Donald explorers<br>Pioneers not<br>caretakers and there's something in that<br>despite the well on top of the very<br>colonialist perspective of explorers and<br>Pioneers but it's that not caretakers<br>that really made me think about Patricia<br>Coleman again and the idea of Home<br>Science um the applied sciences<br>tradition here perhaps which is maybe<br>subverting that in a way and saying well<br>actually some things can be valuable um<br>even if they're not yeah there's there's<br>a there's something really really<br>important about understanding that the<br>the values we ascribe to science this<br>idea of exploring and pioneering things<br>rather than actually caking um yeah<br>they're not necessarily mutually<br>exclusive virtues uh but they're not<br>perhaps both equally well treated within<br>science<br>so the work I do is Material Science and<br>I'm again just sort of reflecting back<br>on um the applied sciences I know<br>there's some sort of textile science<br>that happens uh in this space and one of<br>the things I did last year was give a um<br>a lecture a public lecture with the<br>mcdad Institute which went around the<br>country and one of the things we tried<br>to do is explain to the public what<br>material science is about and so I refer<br>to this picture of fabric as one of the<br>ways of saying well actually the first<br>context I would have used the word<br>material in was well taking material to<br>school for clothing classes that would<br>have been um you know the first use of<br>the word that may meant anything to me<br>and actually it's a use that corresponds<br>to more or less what we do in Material<br>Science because we worry about the<br>things that we can make things from and<br>it turns out when you go down and down<br>and down to the basics of that that<br>means worrying about the atoms and the<br>structures that you can build out of<br>atoms that we can make things<br>from<br>um and so here's my periodic table full<br>of different kinds of atoms and it's one<br>of my favorite versions of the periodic<br>table because you can see the kinds of<br>materials that can be made out of those<br>different atoms the kind of things that<br>they correspond to and so what my work<br>involves is this idea of taking atoms<br>creating maybe Nano structures things<br>out of those atoms and then building<br>materials out of that so very<br>conceptually it's a kind of Lego um<br>where you might be building Nano<br>structures that are still too small to<br>see but that determine somehow the final<br>function of your material and then<br>depending on how you arrange those<br>things depending on the way they<br>interact with each other in a very<br>conceptual way you're determining<br>whether you build something out of that<br>Lego that can fly or that can be a<br>sailboat right so this is a very a very<br>um schematic way of thinking about the<br>problem but the really important thing<br>that I wanted to to to think about here<br>is in response<br>to Steph Hawkings comment that we just<br>have to get off the planet because we're<br>going to run out of resources actually<br>there are there are many different ways<br>of framing what we can do with our<br>science and Having the courage to think<br>about actually how we can live on this<br>planet sustainably for example um Having<br>the courage to think about the problem<br>of caretaking uh and taking that as a<br>serious scientific challenge um that's<br>maybe less straightforwardly possible<br>within science because of the relative<br>status that we ascribe to different<br>forms of science the relative value<br>that's ascribed to being the Pioneer or<br>the Explorer um versus a a caker say so<br>I I think these are things that we need<br>to think<br>about I'm just going to pop this up um<br>to acknowledge the te who invited me<br>down here um and just because I think it<br>also applies to some of how I think now<br>about the science that I do and that we<br>need to think broadly we need to be<br>inclusive um and I think that's<br>important so I'm going to finish uh on<br>this<br>slide and just with a a quote from ma<br>plank which is a little bit um a little<br>bit<br>uh pessimistic I suppose um the idea<br>that you've got to wait for the older<br>generation to die off before we can fix<br>anything and it's it's really not true<br>in the context of equity because I think<br>what's clear is that if there's a quote<br>that I would actually replace this with<br>now I think it would be something about<br>um the price of Freedom being Eternal<br>vigilance and I think it's not just<br>Freedom it's it's all kinds of progress<br>the work is never done you need to keep<br>doing the work and unfortunately when<br>that work goes unacknowledged which is<br>what is often the case with Equity work<br>um there's a sense in which we we feel<br>like we've gotten somewhere when we<br>haven't uh because that work is still<br>going on at a continuous level and so<br>those are just some of the things I<br>think we need to be conscious of so<br>thank you all uh for your attention and<br>I'll stop there I'm just going to put up<br>a uh quick advertisement for the next<br>two public lectures I know that are<br>going to come up um quite soon I'll just<br>leave those up there in case there are<br>some questions<br>thank you<br>Nicola I'm Cheryl Wilson I am the former<br>director of the consumer and applied<br>sciences program and uh one of the uh<br>original Home Science alumni and in fact<br>I was a student in the last years of<br>Patricia's time here as as Dean so it's<br>very nice to see uh her photographs<br>there and to um hear you speak of equity<br>which meant so much to<br>Patricia before I thank Nicola are there<br>any<br>questions does anyone have any questions<br>or comments that you would like to make<br>we have uh a stream going out for people<br>who are joining us<br>from alumni particularly from around the<br>country so uh if you do have questions<br>we will need to uh bring the microphone<br>to<br>questions it had to be someone right up<br>cheers thank you<br>um I remember in uh in a final cohort I<br>was in uh finishing off uh a PhD in<br>organizational psychology and we had a<br>female Professor this was at Virginia<br>Tech um State<br>University and she was uh warning us<br>about the impact of our decision to do<br>our our phds in organizational<br>psychology because the career field was<br>becoming increasingly dominated by<br>females and that we should therefore<br>expect that recommended salaries uh in<br>the hey group and the consulting firms<br>that specialize in compensation analysis<br>would be diminishing over time when I<br>saw your um your example about student<br>evaluations um favoring males um it<br>reminded me of evidence I'd come across<br>that uh when men do really cool<br>caretaking things like help throw put<br>together retirement or farewell luncheon<br>um or some social event of some kind uh<br>for their workplace they earn brownie<br>points because they're doing nice social<br>caretaking things whereas when female<br>staff members including teachers and<br>professors do that uh it's just sort of<br>you know it's in their root somehow it's<br>just they're expected to be more<br>communal so you certainly see some<br>evidence that status and agentic<br>occupations um end up with higher pay<br>scales compar compared to communitarian<br>or Comm<br>uh regardless of whether it's males or<br>females in the jobs so this affects<br>Primary School and kindergarten teachers<br>and on and on I was just curious if you<br>see a connection because the the student<br>evaluations part of the way you get good<br>student evaluations I think would be uh<br>caretaking stuff you get the marks back<br>on time it's pastoral care availability<br>to the students and those are sort of<br>caretaking things and maybe female<br>lectures don't earn any brownie points<br>for doing that stuff but the males do<br>just I don't know just a thought is that<br>possible yes I think that's a reasonably<br>good summary of of what's largely going<br>on<br>yeah if I can't say it any better I<br>don't think I should<br>else so we in Europe we have now the<br>companies are forced to have like 3%<br>female stuff at the top but at the same<br>time I don't want to be at the top just<br>because I'm female<br>y this is why it matters how we talk<br>about these things I guess that's one of<br>the things that I want to stress um my<br>opinion on the issue of quote is is<br>something that's changed a little bit<br>but they're really I mean they're very<br>uncomfortable things um and I guess the<br>what I would use to explain my my<br>feeling now is that Max plank quote the<br>idea that you know you've got to wait<br>for a whole generation to die off before<br>things will change um and that in<br>combination with some of the sort of<br>backlash we've seen already around the<br>progress that has been made by women um<br>those things in combination make me<br>think we'll actually the only way to get<br>there is to actually change the status<br>quo and that means well it's worse than<br>getting us to 50 50% representation<br>right now because you've got this<br>historical backlog in terms of<br>representation which is why I show that<br>declining thought of the percentage of<br>Nobel Prize women winners who are women<br>so there's no super simple way to do<br>this the best we could probably do in<br>terms of qus would be to mandate 50 50%<br>now there would be a cost to that<br>biggest issue is the cost to the women<br>who would be seen to be in those roles<br>because they were women and not because<br>they deserved it um I happen to not<br>think that that's a valid point of view<br>but the reality is that there would be a<br>big cost um my feeling is that in some<br>sense we should just suck it up and get<br>on with<br>it um for the sake of being fear to the<br>Next Generation for the sake of being<br>fear to young girls who are say 5 years<br>old right now we can't actually afford<br>to wait so yeah I would say I'm probably<br>in favor of quoters based on that kind<br>of<br>justifications but I agree that the<br>people it's unfairest to are actually<br>the women who would yeah um feel<br>Provisions thank you for a really<br>interesting talk I'll give one quite<br>positive piece and that I started<br>nursing 30 years ago scary thought but<br>there we go and at that time you quite<br>often heard particularly older P older<br>patients saying oh I had that nice lady<br>doctor you don't hear that now equally<br>the male nurse that's dropped out of of<br>common usage they're just nurses which I<br>think is quite a good step forward do<br>you think that's been something that's<br>been achieved<br>deliberately no I think they've just<br>become more common you know 50% of the<br>um medical school is<br>female on student side anyway not on the<br>teaching<br>side my question though is on the slide<br>that you showed of the distribution by<br>percentage Across The Sciences quite a<br>number of them seem to have a bit of a<br>dip in the female graduates in the 2000s<br>early 2000s<br>right explanation around that um there<br>um depends a little bit on which<br>disciplines you're looking at um there<br>are some which are particularly<br>interesting so computer science is one<br>where there definitely has been a<br>decline it's one of the sharpest and the<br>interesting thing about that is that<br>there's a suspicion that it correlates<br>with the introduction of PCS into the<br>family home and that these are a thing<br>that due to societal um stereotypes or<br>differences um were provided<br>preferentially to young boys and that<br>that's where this um masculation of<br>computer science has come from where um<br>if you any if anybody's gone to see the<br>movie hidden figures which is out right<br>now which is quite an excellent<br>representation of this know the original<br>computers were women who did<br>calculations at places like NASA um<br>because it was considered a menial task<br>like typing um so yeah so that's<br>something that's definitely changed in<br>negative sense um in relatively recent<br>yeah I mean I I guess I would also say<br>there's a little bit of the other sort<br>of the general pop psychology literature<br>about Mena from Ms women of from Venus<br>those sorts of things which maybe also<br>influence some of those other that's<br>hi thank you I was just going to say if<br>you could wave a magic wand and get the<br>University of otara to do one thing that<br>you think would make the biggest<br>difference to equity at the University<br>of atago what would it be you can be<br>provocative<br>or<br>not one<br>thing guess they could stick quotas on<br>all their science departments to have<br>50% women in academic roles I mean um I<br>don't I don't know bab<br>um one<br>thing without going as far as quotas for<br>the reasons that I guess I've already<br>discussed<br>the biggest thing you can probably do is<br>collect data about your current<br>processes and be really transparent<br>about what that looks like um because of<br>I guess what I talk about with people<br>becoming quite defensive and wanting to<br>say that no things are actually okay<br>when they're not necessarily um some of<br>the ways I mean data is collected people<br>do care about this issue but often it's<br>aggregated in ways either across levels<br>of seniority in one discipline or across<br>disciplines within the Sciences which<br>mask some of the the bigger problems so<br>yeah being transparent about the data<br>and taking it seriously that you need to<br>look at it and keep monitoring it um and<br>understand if you're making progress or<br>if you're not and then if you're not you<br>more the backlash can be in very subtle<br>ways in the 80s it was believed that the<br>fundamental religions were pushing their<br>brightest girls into medicine to try and<br>influence<br>anti-abortion and they not quite so<br>bright girls were pushed into<br>teaching particularly male less bright<br>boys into teaching um to stop issues<br>like um treaty awareness and things like<br>that also um<br>when women's professions have been<br>opened up to men seems that magically<br>the men get to the top much more quickly<br>than women who've entered at the same<br>time sometimes referred to as the glass<br>escalator yes yes<br>and it's subtle at so many<br>subtle I guess the one thing I would say<br>about things that are subtle is that<br>they can be additionally damaging if<br>you're then put through the extra<br>emotional work of trying to figure out<br>if they're actually real or not and so<br>subtle things can actually be very<br>damaging I I would add<br>that so thanks for that talk that was<br>really inspirational and um nice to have<br>those things so<br>transparently um<br>out there it's great um so when I was<br>studying for my PhD um I studied under<br>um really prominent senior uh female<br>mentor and<br>um she she gave us the impression that<br>in order to be successful in science we<br>needed to choose whether we were going<br>to be scientists or mothers right and um<br>and and that was what she had Chosen and<br>she felt that if we chose to mothers we<br>would be it was like professional<br>suicide I didn't want to fit that mold<br>and I've had two children and maintained<br>my career but it's it does come with a<br>cost of time and energy and until we can<br>figure out a way for the men to have the<br>babies um it you know it's something<br>that we we do have to deal with so I was<br>just wondering if you had any thoughts<br>about how we can incorporate that into<br>Equity I do um I guess I've got two<br>levels of response one is that I don't<br>talk so much about the problem of women<br>having children and families because<br>firstly it should be more Equitable than<br>it is and I know it's not in terms of<br>who does the the caring work um but<br>secondly I think often I've seen it used<br>as an excuse to not dealing with some of<br>the more unconscious bias type issues<br>right because women will have kids and<br>therefore we can't do anything about it<br>um it was the recent Chancellor of Massi<br>who made his comments about V women in<br>vet science being worth TW two fifths um<br>a real vet uh because they had families<br>after they graduated and therefore never<br>contributed as much to the economy etc<br>etc and using that as a justification<br>for trying to get more men into that<br>school so there's that sort of dismissal<br>of the problem which is why sometimes<br>it's I don't like to say that women<br>having families is the only issue<br>because it's definitely not on the other<br>hand it's it's really clearly a<br>practical issue um but I think part of<br>the issue is the messaging that you got<br>and other people get that the two are<br>not compatible and of course it's hard<br>of course it's hard it's hard for a<br>woman in any um in any kind of working<br>environment to have children and still<br>do everything that needs doing<br>um it's should be and it is actually<br>it's hard for men who who do their fair<br>share of of family care<br>so it's it's very hard but I think so<br>much it's it's made into a bigger<br>problem than it should be by the way<br>that we talk about it sometimes and I<br>think actually we need to just take a<br>step back and say you can do these<br>things and sometimes we're actually just<br>going to have to adjust the way that we<br>operate as a system in order to make it<br>possible because we need people to be<br>having children and that shouldn't EXP<br>include anyone from the workforce one of<br>the biggest things actually on this that<br>I do think is an issue is the way we<br>value experience in Academia and science<br>so we we kind of um have all these<br>systems from promotions criteria to PBF<br>to to whatever else that look at the<br>cumulative um impact or contribution<br>that a person has made over their career<br>and that's what we evaluate people on<br>and what we pay them on<br>and we don't account for break career<br>breaks well the the relative to<br>opportunity thing is is it is a joke<br>really so we do need to get much better<br>at unpacking that and saying well<br>actually no you pay somebody for the<br>contribution they're making right now<br>and of course that's a function of<br>experience but it's not as much a<br>function of experience as what we make<br>one more or have we reached an end one<br>more um I really enjoy the way that you<br>in U introduce uh social media and pop<br>culture into your presentations and I<br>noticed that you talk a lot about uh the<br>various different kinds of push back<br>that have happened to um in response to<br>studies and I was wondering if you could<br>speak more on whether or not you think<br>that the push back in modern media and<br>in social media how that impacts the<br>progress is that that Mak sense yeah I<br>can<br>um I think it's a really important part<br>of the story which is why I talk about<br>it I suppose um but for me I would say<br>that my experience of social media and<br>the in this story is more positive than<br>not in terms of learning about other<br>people's experiences seeing how there<br>are common threads in different places<br>you things that would you would never<br>have found out about 20 years ago now<br>become very um easily shared amongst a<br>community of people uh and I find<br>Twitter really good for that for for<br>seeing and interacting with women in<br>science in different parts of the world<br>with very very different experiences and<br>probably half the content of this<br>presentation literally is just from um<br>interacting with people on Twitter and<br>seeing you know finding the the kinds of<br>people who are interested in this<br>material<br>so I think social media is great for<br>that I think there are there are some<br>really um important things that can be<br>learned I think the other part of that<br>is that so much of the problem is<br>societal that you've actually got to<br>look at society as a whole in order to<br>understand it and the way people respond<br>to these different kinds of messages<br>about what science is and what it isn't<br>that's actually the biggest part of the<br>problem so I don't think we we can<br>always just be looking at what's going<br>on within Academia within the university<br>um but how Society responds to us is is<br>a huge part of understanding what's<br>ncka I have a message from our uh PVC of<br>Sciences uh Professor Richard Barker uh<br>asked me to thank you on uh behalf of<br>Sciences for coming to speak to us and<br>um I'm sure that I also would convey the<br>thanks of those who have come today to<br>listen to you you speak unfortunately<br>Richard couldn't be here because he had<br>a prior engagement talking to P Pacifica<br>students welcoming them to the<br>University of<br>otago however he did ask me to convey<br>and Excuse me while I read his message<br>he said that in his view uh ensuring<br>women and more generally everyone is<br>able to fulfill it potential as an<br>important issue for all of us and<br>especially for those of us with<br>responsibility to lead uh and uh to<br>continue on that note I think uh you<br>have conveyed very clearly to all of us<br>here that we have a responsibility to<br>actually all lead in this matter that we<br>need to look to ourselves but also to<br>look to the message that we are<br>conveying to others if we are to sponsor<br>you didn't talk about sponsorship today<br>but you talked um tonight but you talked<br>earlier today about mentoring of those<br>who follow us into<br>Sciences but also the need to sponsor<br>people so it's more than just mentoring<br>it is that sponsorship that uh so often<br>we see our male colleagues sponsoring<br>each other that we need to sponsor those<br>younger than us perhaps those of a<br>different ethnicity to us well<br>definitely those uh who need our<br>sponsorship to help them on their their<br>path to uh careers that will in which<br>they can<br>flourish should we say and certainly<br>that is what um has happened in my<br>career I have seen um I've seen Patricia<br>and and other uh people who have<br>mentored and sponsored me so I challenge<br>sponsor now it seems very fitting uh for<br>me to um thank you and to present you<br>with uh this limited edition print it is<br>a print of uh a work that was donated to<br>the school in memory of a student uh and<br>it is a print of uh Shona mcfallen um<br>sketch of the University of Oto so we<br>have a very female theme going on<br>tonight uh thank you very much for your<br>time</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
