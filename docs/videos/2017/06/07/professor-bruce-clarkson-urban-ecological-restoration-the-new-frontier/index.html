Perhaps those living in residential areas had been comforted by the fact that the Department of Conservation and its predecessors have been doing their best to save our native birds from extinction on offshore islands, or more recently, mainland eco-sanctuaries. But, these endeavours on their own, are not enough to reverse the ongoing decline in native biodiversity.

series I'm going to take you<br>on a little bit of a journey because you<br>need to understand a bit about me and<br>where I've come from and why I'm so<br>passionate about urban ecological<br>restoration but first I want to pay<br>homage to Sir Charles Alexander Fleming<br>for 1916 passed away 1987 I was<br>privileged to meet him on one occasion<br>when I was a student and I was at the<br>opening of what is now known as the<br>Egmont national park visitors center<br>while I was here at university I got to<br>know his work extremely well I've still<br>got the textbook from when I was a<br>student the geological history of New<br>Zealand and it's life by Charles<br>Alexander Fleming he was raised in an<br>ornithologist I I departed from birds at<br>age 11 so there was a bit of a<br>difference here between us but he also<br>was the person who provided the<br>framework of understanding how our New<br>Zealand flora and fauna is so unique and<br>the map on that graph that on the<br>diagram up there that you can see is his<br>summary of what is known as the bio<br>Geographic elements of the New Zealand<br>fauna and flora I can still remember<br>answering the exam question here at the<br>University of Waikato let three elements<br>of the bio Geographic elements of New<br>Zealand and explain their dispersal mode<br>and their timetable in arrival twenty<br>marks<br>you also need to know a little bit about<br>me because that will I think give you an<br>insight into why I have the strong<br>interest in ecological restoration call<br>Bruce Clarkson mewho called Taranaki Tim<br>ulna call manganui to our corner Tea<br>Party we K kirikiriroa in Ohana in I&amp;A<br>KT for iguana or Wakata a ho in Mahayana<br>tenor koto tena koutou katoa that<br>explains why I'm in the space tonight my<br>upbringing on a farm at the foot of that<br>longer it's no surprise that I became<br>first what you might refer to as a<br>natural historian and naturally evolved<br>into being an ecologist those are the<br>things that influenced my thinking you<br>now know a little bit about my<br>background I now want to give you a<br>little bit more background about<br>conservation biology before urban<br>ecology because I posed that question on<br>the new frontier and in order to<br>understand that you need to know a<br>little bit of history about conservation<br>biology in New Zealand so it really<br>started with Richard Henry in 1894 when<br>he translocated some native birds on two<br>offshore islands to help them escape<br>from the Predators the weasels the<br>states the rats and the mice that killed<br>the chicks and eat the eggs and that<br>work was followed up by some amazing<br>work from people who are in the audience<br>tonight actual Island restoration by the<br>New Zealand Wildlife Service in the<br>period around about the 1970s they had<br>evolved gradually into another<br>conservation approach that we refer to<br>as the doc mainland island approach and<br>again there are at least one person in<br>the audience tonight Alan soon as I saw<br>him out there in the lobby key<br>individuals in this endless progress<br>towards sustained and intensive netted<br>predator control on the mainland in<br>order to look after our foreigner mainly<br>but also<br>or that has evolved today to a scenario<br>where we have in our taro newzealand 73<br>sanctuaries at least scattered across<br>the mainland or the near shore mainland<br>and the significant shift that has<br>occurred has been one away from control<br>of projects by government agencies to<br>one of 42 of the 73 projects community<br>lead that has been the most significant<br>shift in the way we operate in new<br>zealand in recent times now you need to<br>also know that I wasn't always an urban<br>ecologist and it's almost as if there<br>was a plan I had no knowledge of this<br>plan but I need to tell you about the<br>plan<br>because I was born beneath the manga and<br>because my first interest was in<br>volcanoes and vegetation recovery after<br>volcanic eruption little did I know that<br>I was setting the scene for my future in<br>urban ecology I was lucky enough to work<br>for the DSi R of New Zealand and I got<br>the opportunity to work across all of<br>the volcanoes of New Zealand and I used<br>methodologies working alongside my wife<br>Bev is also here tonight what's called<br>the krona sequence methodology where you<br>use space instead of time where you know<br>the age of a land surface and you can<br>construct the story based on sampling<br>different aged land surfaces I also use<br>data collection from what is called data<br>direct monitoring where you measure a<br>plot and you measure everything inside<br>it and then you go back again five years<br>later or 10 years later to learn how the<br>vegetation has changed and as I got<br>better understanding of the discipline I<br>also realize that combinations of the<br>two approaches were the most powerful of<br>all because the krona sequence relies on<br>an assumption that all of the sites of<br>different age that you're comparing have<br>the same environmental conditions<br>sometimes meeting that assumption is<br>quite difficult but if you can use<br>Crona sequences in combination with<br>direct monitoring then you have a form<br>of verification and last but not least<br>I've been involved in what are called<br>field experiments where you add a plant<br>to the system or you remove a plant from<br>the system of course you do that with<br>the permission of the Department of<br>Conservation and you also make sure that<br>after you've run the experiment you go<br>back and remove the offending party if<br>you like but this can be very revealing<br>and understanding how plant assemblages<br>come together how they develop and<br>evolve and change over time and so to<br>show you some of that this is the sort<br>of work that I used to do before I got<br>into urban ecology this is a Cronus<br>sequence from Hawaii five years to 130<br>years starting with the galava being<br>colonized by the lichens and the ferns<br>progressing through to the arrival of<br>the first flowering plant and in this<br>case metros it arose the relative of our<br>New Zealand pehota Kawa or here growing<br>on this on the site there and then<br>through to 130 years where the or here<br>is starting to bulk up and beginning a<br>new young forest taking it through to<br>150 or 300 years a model system of how<br>plants our symbol how they form a new<br>ecosystem how they achieve what we call<br>canopy cover the trees close over dense<br>canopy cover and the change in the<br>environment that leads to the<br>colonization of the shade tolerant<br>species and in this case the tree<br>pensive odium which is a close relative<br>of our native societies and being a<br>scientist of course I couldn't just rely<br>on the pictures I had to produce the<br>graph this is the classic graft of<br>succession on Hawaiian lava flows from 0<br>years to 400 years showing the lichens<br>and mosses dominant at first giving way<br>to a fern at an intermediate stage but<br>the line to really look at is the red<br>line of dominance by<br>Duras taking over at about a hundred<br>years and then becoming the late<br>successional some people might say<br>climax forest at forty four hundred<br>years so what that work taught me was<br>about the biotic and abiotic limitations<br>in natural successions using nature as<br>the baseline natural systems as the<br>baseline and I'm not going to go through<br>all of the detail there but those are<br>the key points summarized from a large<br>number of publications I've been<br>involved in and some of the points there<br>that are most relevant to what we're<br>going to talk about shortly relate to<br>the fertility status of the soil and the<br>differences between a natural succession<br>and one in an urban system but also<br>about the importance of understanding<br>your local flora and your regional flora<br>and how that moves across the landscape<br>how it disperses and how it colonizers<br>and most important of all than that last<br>point what are the species that are the<br>pioneers the one that pave the way for<br>the others that followed afterwards how<br>do they facilitate or change their<br>environment to allow other species to<br>come later and form that late<br>successional vegetation these were all<br>key learnings that I was acquiring when<br>I was doing this work originally which<br>stood me in good stead later so I'm now<br>going to turn to urban systems and in<br>urban world and of course we all know<br>that the world is becoming increasingly<br>urbanized fifty-four percent of the<br>world population currently living in<br>cities and the projection for by 2050 of<br>sixty-four percent of people living in<br>cities and also knowing that cities have<br>the major impact on our environment it's<br>really important to remember that it's<br>not just occurring within the footprint<br>of where the city is based but way<br>beyond the edges and the reach of the<br>actual footprint of the city out into<br>the region out into the nation and even<br>globally because cities<br>consume enormous amount of resource to<br>keep them going<br>London 125 times its land area Tokyo<br>three times the total area of Japan and<br>also to know that the average world<br>citizen when you do the calculations<br>currently the eco footprint of 2.7<br>hectares<br>when there are in fact only<br>approximately 2.1 hectares of bio<br>productive land per capita available on<br>the earth and it's a great Mahatma<br>Gandhi said earth provides enough to<br>satisfy every man's need but not every<br>man's greed I've been doing a lot of<br>thinking about about this problem and<br>thinking about how we might find some<br>solutions to it and at a recent<br>conference that I attended in Wellington<br>which was called the crazy and ambitious<br>conference the crazy and ambitious idea<br>or the other the new way of looking at<br>this is what if cities are viewed not as<br>the problem but the solution to saving<br>our indigenous biodiversity and so my<br>talk has now going to cross over on<br>mainly focusing on nature native plants<br>and animals it will stray sometimes into<br>green space and it's set within a way<br>broader context of natural capital so I<br>need to tell you a little bit about<br>urban ecology itself urban ecology is a<br>new discipline it's only been around in<br>the world for about 20 years or so and<br>it is a discipline which focuses on<br>understanding ecosystems that include<br>humans living in them living in cities<br>in urbanizing landscapes it's an<br>emerging interdisciplinary field that<br>aims to understand how human and<br>ecological processes coexist some people<br>have talked about it as coupled<br>ecological sociological and cultural<br>systems combined and coexisting and<br>above all how it can help us how it can<br>help society with their efforts to<br>become more sustainable so now I'm going<br>to get to our tea erroneously<br>and and tell you a little bit about<br>urban centers in our taro new zealand<br>and and how i've been approaching this<br>problem so 87% of its are new zealand<br>live in urban centres but of course when<br>we say urban in new zealand question is<br>are they really cities I'll get to that<br>in a minute notice that all of our<br>cities except two major exceptions the<br>one we're living in here in Hamilton and<br>Rotorua across the way are located<br>mainly in the coastal zone and that is<br>the zone that has had the greatest<br>depletion and degradation of our natural<br>ecosystems that's another reason why if<br>we can sort things out in cities we<br>might be able to sort things out for<br>biodiversity more widely on the<br>landscape so are they actually cities<br>this thing while actually probably not<br>most what we call cities in New Zealand<br>are probably just big towns with the<br>exception of Auckland which clearly is<br>because of the trouble that it's having<br>is clearly a city small land areas low<br>population densities but the focus of my<br>talk is actually about the ecology and<br>the last bullet point there I'm going to<br>be weaving into my story native<br>vegetation cover in the built-up area of<br>New Zealand cities ranges from less than<br>one percent to eight point nine percent<br>compared to international situations<br>where in some cities in South America<br>for example 30 or 40 percent of the city<br>has natural vegetation still remaining<br>and even Perth in Australia has<br>approximately 25 to 30 percent of its<br>natural vegetation still existing within<br>the built-up matrix of the city so I've<br>done some research with some colleagues<br>which has tried to understand using a<br>surrogate for biodiversity native<br>vegetation cover how its distributed on<br>the landscape in urban environments and<br>this is our methodology a GIS system<br>using some fancy algorithms to make sure<br>that we're comparing like with like<br>because every New Zealand City actually<br>has a different<br>Ministry of makeup Dunedin for example<br>there's mass of an extent Hamilton City<br>is only around about 10,000 hectares<br>different cities have different<br>administrative setups and the only way<br>you can compare ecological features is<br>to use a methodology like this so this<br>is the graph that was derived from that<br>work that we did quite a while back now<br>in 2007 which showed that there are only<br>four major distribution types of<br>biodiversity in New Zealand cities if<br>you use vegetation as a surrogate and<br>you know there are some limitations to<br>that so I want you to look carefully at<br>the graph and you'll see up here the 10%<br>figure and you'll see a different mode<br>of operation for different cities and so<br>we have Wellington up here which is a<br>scene curve start slow builds and then<br>declines we have down here Nelson which<br>is a B curve and it starts slow builds<br>and carries on the green curve still<br>increasing as you go out from the centre<br>of the city and the one unique city here<br>that has the strange curb where it<br>starts high in the middle declines in<br>the period and zone and then increases<br>on the edge of this of courses new<br>climate city and the one here<br>unfortunately for us in Hamilton Napier<br>Hastings and Christchurch is the flat<br>line curve of biodiversity and that's<br>why I've taken an interest in how you<br>bring nature back into cities my crazy<br>and ambitious idea that I launched at<br>the conference in Wellington was what if<br>we decided in every one of these cities<br>that we could all achieve 10% in the<br>built up matrix and that's what I'm<br>going to be talking to you about tonight<br>really how we're going to achieve that<br>target so some people say to me well why<br>did you pick 10% well it's sort of semi<br>arbitrary but I'm going to show you some<br>science behind it as well and the<br>science rests largely on what are called<br>species Iria kurds and fragmentation<br>curves<br>but also recently on a paper that was<br>just published in the New Zealand<br>Journal of ecology gave me great heart<br>because it you know he liked papers that<br>support your ideas<br>scientists are meant to do that five to<br>ten percent according to ruffle and<br>denim is the critical point at which<br>looking after indigenous habitats<br>becomes crucial in ensuring that we<br>maintain the full diversity of plants<br>and animals on our landscape and so I'm<br>sort of holding my case I think building<br>my case around these lines of evidence<br>but this is the one that really is I<br>think the most important of all so these<br>are curves that developed by researchers<br>from Sweden Han ski in particular and<br>the thing to look at here is that on the<br>axis here the 10% line here is this line<br>the 10% line and what it's saying is<br>that when habitat area or fragmentation<br>increases to a point where you have less<br>than ten percent of your original extent<br>there is a massive drop-off in the<br>number of species that can be maintained<br>on the landscape that's what I'm resting<br>my justification on for my ten percent<br>target so now let's think about Hamilton<br>and what we need to do so Hamilton<br>nested in the middle of the indigenous<br>biodiversity desert and with some<br>amazing natural features about 15<br>kilometres out of town namely the<br>hakimoto range that you can see on the<br>right-hand side of that image there and<br>and although an extremely attractive<br>city you know it is certainly a<br>beautiful city and it's got this<br>incredible feature the Waikato River<br>running right through it which we don't<br>properly utilize in terms of our<br>planning and design it it has suffered<br>greatly in terms of loss of indigenous<br>species and the reasons for this I think<br>are really two twofold first of all the<br>a worldview that has been perpetuated in<br>Hamilton City by the European settler<br>and I'm one of them so I can point the<br>finger of myself here that actually<br>native is not good and should be<br>replaced by things that come from my<br>so-called home country the other thing<br>that's acted against this in cities like<br>Hamilton is the low terrain the flattish<br>relief has made it a lot easier for<br>people to be extremely efficient at<br>removing all trace of the indigenous on<br>the landscape and even today when<br>subdivisions are being developed some of<br>the development is far from sensitive<br>these are the last little residue of a<br>native pocket in a gully at a<br>subdivision see what they did here in<br>the gully<br>just removed everything this photograph<br>is taken from the site of where my house<br>is currently and I want you to hold this<br>in your mind for a picture I'm going to<br>show you later<br>there's the tire dump from the local<br>garage in the gully and at the back<br>there it's hard to see but there's a<br>fence line there and the key point about<br>this is that most subdivision in<br>Hamilton City has come in from the rural<br>area it's been brought into the city and<br>it's been subjected to all of the<br>pressures and impacts of agriculture<br>before it was then turned into a<br>subdivision and that again has acted<br>against retention of indigenous habitats<br>and indigenous species it's not all bad<br>though we do have some rather amazing<br>assets within our city and this this<br>slide really is trying to summarize some<br>of that but it's also getting across the<br>point of how small and how fragmented is<br>that resource that we have here in<br>Hamilton City approximately 67 key sites<br>recognized in the city mean size mean<br>area 1.1 hectares and the best examples<br>of forest remnants left in our city up<br>on the top left here courtland's bush<br>were more rightly called tip-up nui 5.2<br>is of remnant dominated by kakatiya and<br>at the bottom hammond bush and i'm sure<br>there are people in the audience tonight<br>oh no both these places really well and<br>have done a lot of the good work to<br>restore these places Hammond bush 1.1<br>hectares beside the Waikato River but<br>notice the interior of the courtland's<br>bush or tip Avenue II and just how<br>healthy and vigorous it is now that it's<br>being managed properly so restoration of<br>existing patches is one thing and the<br>recipes for restoring patches of forest<br>or remnants and cities are extremely<br>well known you remove the weeds and the<br>pests you try and buffer the patch<br>because it's so small you try and expand<br>the patch you're connected to other<br>patches but in the cities like Hamilton<br>Napier Hastings and Christchurch that is<br>not enough to achieve the 10% threshold<br>that I'm talking about and what we need<br>in those cities is what we call<br>reconstruction or retrofitting of<br>indigenous habitats and that's largely<br>what my research has been around in<br>urban environments so first of all<br>reconstruction what is reconstruction<br>well it's certainly moving beyond what<br>we used to do which is really just<br>revegetation we have put a few trees on<br>the ground and you walk away and you<br>think you've done a good job well you<br>know that's just the beginning of the<br>story it's about target ecosystems and<br>habitats it's about bringing back full<br>assemblages and and acquiring<br>appropriate species occupancy it's about<br>building habitat for all components of<br>the ecosystems and not just native birds<br>I am a botanist remember so all of the<br>learnings that I took from understanding<br>natural disturbance and volcanic<br>landscapes can be summarized in this<br>diagram the most important framework<br>that you need for reconstructing<br>indigenous habitats is a natural<br>successional framework and I'm not the<br>first person<br>to have cotton onto any of this of<br>course in 1983 the president of the<br>British Akers ecological society Tony<br>Bradshaw said the ultimate challenge for<br>ecologists is to reconstruct ecosystems<br>what he was saying basically is it's all<br>very well studying them understanding<br>their processes their dynamics their<br>functioning but actually if you could<br>reconstruct one you must really know<br>about it and that's exactly what we've<br>been trying to do so we've been trying<br>to lick natural succession and recovery<br>to restoration and reconstruction using<br>a successional framework understanding<br>the different constraints and<br>opportunities presented by the urban<br>environment and understanding the<br>environmental drivers that make these<br>processes work or don't work so now<br>let's talk about some of the places<br>where you can do reconstruction the<br>ultimate place to do reconstruction and<br>Hamilton is in a Hamilton gully and<br>we've got plenty of them mangok or took<br>we took and named after the native<br>fuchsia the court took luta view that<br>gives us a clue about the target you<br>know the target that we might apply here<br>at the moment though most of our<br>Hamilton gullies are dominated by what<br>some scientists call novel ecosystems my<br>view on novel ecosystems is that they<br>are there to be replaced by indigenous<br>dominated ecosystems you can report me<br>on that anybody when you see counter<br>account abusing in the newspapers at the<br>moment tell them that you agree with me<br>remove the novel HECO system and replace<br>it with indigenous dominated ecosystem<br>so they are dominated largely by willow<br>and Amazon here gray willow and cracked<br>willow they do have some values for<br>birds of course the rules persists where<br>you have old-growth willow and so when<br>you're making your conversion your<br>reconstruction you do need to consider<br>transitional processes to make sure<br>you're not taking away values that you<br>want to retain but having<br>said that in order to get the full range<br>of species occupancy in order to get<br>some of the special birds that people<br>love the most like the two E and the<br>velvet it's best that you remove the<br>willow because they do not provide the<br>range of services needed to maintain<br>those birds in the habitat and so the<br>target ecosystem for gully restoration<br>in Hamilton City is largely one of<br>bringing back kakatiya bukhatir<br>swamp Myra forests and and then of<br>course providing all of the services for<br>the birds that we love<br>I wanted to particularly make reference<br>to swamp Mari or Y Walker because the<br>longer I've been in the game of doing<br>the practical restoration myself and<br>Hamilton gully what I've realized is<br>that why walker or swamp Mari is the<br>ultimate ecosystem engineer it's the one<br>that can really get control of your<br>gully and take the control off in the<br>exotic weeds and it's because of its<br>special characteristics it's got an<br>amazing route network with what I called<br>new metaphors it can it has breathing<br>routes to survive and very poorly<br>drained sites and it is a member of the<br>same family as pavada Kawa and rata and<br>of course we're all really worried at<br>the moment about what will happen if<br>Myrtle rust gets further south and<br>kerikeri and starts hitting on some of<br>our key species like the white Walker so<br>then the question arises you can do all<br>this work and have you actually restored<br>it have you reached a threshold where<br>you consider that you've been successful<br>here's a couple of examples on the Left<br>Munga ET gully where you have a<br>community dominated by pioneers edges<br>particularly character sector and here's<br>our own backyard Bev and I this is where<br>we hang out at the weekend sometimes<br>when we not working too hard at<br>university kakatiya flax swamp mire e in<br>the back there we have got the<br>beginnings if you like of that target<br>eCos<br>operating in our own backyard but is 20<br>years enough well if you go to another<br>site in Hamilton City here sillies<br>galley on our Mar street you can see a<br>place where Owen JC Lee started<br>restoring more than 40 years ago and the<br>picture here is showing a field trip<br>that occurred in November associated<br>with the Ecological Society conference<br>here in in Hamilton and here is an<br>assembled quorum if you like of<br>ecologists and they are all of the same<br>mind that we have reached the threshold<br>for restoration because some of the<br>people standing in that stand there came<br>from other parts of New Zealand and they<br>did not could not believe that actually<br>this was a created a reconstructed<br>ecosystem also I'd like to he won't go<br>to read at the back there's a little<br>quote there from L and JC Lee the man<br>that started this work I have every met<br>we'd know the human kind but in the end<br>the bush prevails<br>so galley restoration started in about<br>the year 2000 and subsequently here in<br>Hamilton City we've moved on to our and<br>another project it's not a project<br>that's replacing working in the gullies<br>it's supplementing an expanding work in<br>the gullies 60 hectares first tree<br>planted in 2004 and there are the target<br>ecosystems for this project in the<br>different colors a lovely little<br>catchment with a peat lake and all of<br>the opportunity provided by the<br>topography and soil variation within<br>this catchment to bring back<br>representative examples of all of the<br>major indigenous ecosystems that once<br>were common in the Hamilton basin and<br>good progress is being made and here is<br>some of the progress so 2004 Google<br>Earth zero hectares of indigenous<br>habitat 2016 31 hectares of indigenous<br>habitat established well on target in<br>the next five to ten years<br>- completely revisit 8no reconstruct the<br>indigenous habitats of the Hamilton<br>basin across that whole area right close<br>to the edge of the city right next to<br>Hamilton zoo what an amazing combination<br>and opportunity the integrated combined<br>activity of the Hamilton zoo focusing on<br>conservation of exotic animals and<br>nearby Wi-Fi carry key Natural Heritage<br>Park focusing on the conservation of our<br>flora and fauna how is the work been<br>done<br>well obviously Hamilton City has done a<br>have a lot of work but what is really<br>significant in this project as well is<br>the role of the community the community<br>has raised on average for the last 10<br>years one hundred and thirty two<br>thousand dollars a year for planting<br>alone it has provided the volunteer<br>labor to replant wiper curriki and it's<br>done so at events like Arbor Day June<br>the second this year I've got the right<br>date Friday June the second this year<br>you all need to be and Wi-Fi curriki to<br>do the next planting notice what was<br>achieved here 1800 people turned up<br>largely schoolkids<br>28,000 plants three hours of work three<br>hectares planted well actually there's a<br>bit of planning goes and be hot behind<br>that but I like giving those statistics<br>a bit of work goes on beforehand but you<br>know you can see it happened before your<br>eyes so this is where the research comes<br>in and I am those of you who are who are<br>not not in the science here I may find<br>this a bit a bit different but I'm<br>hoping you'll you'll take some of this<br>on board because in order for any one of<br>these reconstruction projects to work<br>they need to be underpinned by good<br>science it's the connection between<br>theory and practice which leads to the<br>outcome the implementation on the ground<br>these are the topics that myself and my<br>research team and there's a whole bunch<br>of them sitting on the front row they're<br>my PhD students my masters<br>students my colleagues have been working<br>on since at least the year 2000 to try<br>and do the good science that underpins<br>reconstruction first thing you need to<br>know about your city you need to know<br>what are the native species in your city<br>and you need to know what are the<br>species that grow in the region because<br>you need to know what is missing from<br>the system and therefore what needs to<br>be bought back quick statistic they're<br>three hundred and forty-three species<br>there and and the region and Hamilton<br>city total one hundred ninety-five<br>vascular species the ones that are over<br>represented in our city are pioneers and<br>windus first species that's where the<br>traits come in traits are important in<br>determining what survives in the system<br>and as well knowingness and knowing that<br>when you're doing reconstruction or<br>restoration planning are you using the<br>full range of species that you could or<br>should be using and currently in<br>restoration planning across New Zealand<br>only a subset of what could or should be<br>used is available if you were taking<br>instead a systematic approach so the<br>statistic again they're probably the<br>most startling statistic in the urban<br>setting only 26% of the understory<br>species are found in restorations<br>compared to the reference sites out in<br>the rural zone things do get better<br>here's the Cronus sequence approach<br>being used alongside direct monitoring<br>and it's simply demonstrating that in<br>three age classes native species<br>richness is increasing with time after<br>restoration it's also unfortunately<br>indicating the arrival on one of those<br>little bars to the to the right of each<br>of the stacked columns the arrival of<br>some troublesome exotic Liana's it's<br>also on the positive side showing how<br>even without any any action from humans<br>epiphytes can arrive and start<br>colonizing on the plants that you've<br>planted<br>most notably at Wi-Fi Carribean this is<br>where this data comes from what it's<br>taught us actually is that sometimes you<br>can get and a huge advantage because if<br>you reconstruct on a pasture or<br>agricultural land you get control of the<br>site from the beginning and you do not<br>have the same weed problem that you have<br>as if you go and try and restore an<br>existing patch and so what this is<br>showing is the decline over an 8-year<br>period of all of the pasture plants and<br>weeds that once grew on the site as the<br>natives assert themselves and also<br>showing the rise of natural regeneration<br>so you know that the beginning of<br>success is when the plants that you<br>plant on the slide become reproductively<br>mature and start producing their own<br>seed and so that this over an eight-year<br>period of showing the early development<br>of that process one thing that we have<br>learned from this work is how quickly<br>some native plants can become<br>reproductively mature kakatiya which<br>lives for 800 years can be<br>reproductively mature within eight no<br>one would have thought that unless you<br>were doing this sort of documentation<br>through time so you know it's it's a<br>good sign<br>regeneration is the sign of the<br>beginning of your success but it's it's<br>more complicated than that and this<br>diagram is unfortunately a little<br>complicated but I want you to focus on<br>some clusters here each one of those<br>points represents the composition of a<br>sample on in the green area it's four<br>samples of the vegetation on the site<br>the blue are the plants that are<br>recorded in what we call the feed rain<br>those are the plants coming in from<br>outside the site those are the plants<br>coming from the trees that you already<br>have on your site and then the third<br>cluster here is what's known as the seed<br>bank to be successful in long-term<br>reconstruction<br>you are essentially running a contest<br>the contest starts with plantar bag 3<br>you put the plant in the ground you get<br>the plant growing it becomes<br>reproductively maturity starts producing<br>its own seed you then have to remember<br>that you still have to deal with the<br>plants that come in from outside your<br>sight so you're trying to increase the<br>probabilities that when a seed falls on<br>a suitable site in an urban environment<br>that the plant that will come up will be<br>a native and not an exotic we've shown<br>that over a period of twenty years you<br>can begin to shift the seed rein<br>dominance as well towards native see the<br>arrow here is increasing native<br>dominance the last part that you have to<br>control the hardest part of all is the<br>seed bank because of the persistence of<br>some exotic species but the game is a<br>numbers game get the numbers up in every<br>one of those components vegetation on<br>the side see drain and seed bank and you<br>will eventually reach the threshold when<br>natives start to dominate all components<br>of the system you also up against<br>predation the plants so interesting to<br>remember of course that not only do all<br>of those pests eat birds<br>some of them like rats and mice also eat<br>seed and seedlings and this experiment<br>was simply to show the impact of<br>predation on some late successional<br>species down the side here tower and<br>let's here and he no and it's simply<br>showing that if you caged the seed this<br>is just proving the impact of predators<br>if you caged the seed this is the rate<br>of loss and if you sorry if you caged<br>the seed there and if you don't cage the<br>seed this is the rate of loss the<br>figures are significant 58 percent of<br>the seed will be lost<br>compared to four percent if you cage and<br>protect the seeds but what can you do to<br>trick the predator and this is also what<br>our research has been trying to do it's<br>been doing things like remove the flesh<br>from the sea<br>add a clay coating to the seed if you do<br>those sorts of things you can reduce the<br>predation loss to 35% so we try to learn<br>these techniques if you like to give the<br>natives half a chance you also need to<br>understand how the system changes in<br>response to the things that you've been<br>doing on the site and this is a model<br>developed recently kiri the senior<br>author is in the audience tonight and<br>it's simply showing that in these sites<br>in Hamilton and in New Plymouth there is<br>a significant threshold reached here at<br>about 20 years whereas you achieved<br>canopy cover and you have a more<br>stabilized microclimate that's the shift<br>in microclimate in humidity a shift<br>which occurs both in soil temperature<br>fluctuation and a shift which are human<br>'ti fluctuation that's when you start<br>getting the boost of regeneration it's<br>also when you get much greater<br>establishment of native epiphytes on<br>trees all of these things are showing<br>significant thresholds that can be<br>achieved in order to show that you're<br>starting to win the game one further<br>example enrichment is something that you<br>must do you don't just stop with your<br>pioneer crop you've got to then step in<br>and do some what we call enrichment or<br>enhancement planting and these fancy<br>models simply show that survival and<br>growth increases with canopy ages with<br>one proviso there's a bit of a dip in<br>the model here which shows that if you<br>have to greater dominance of some<br>species it will depress regeneration and<br>the one to watch out for here is Monica<br>when people plant Monica and<br>monocultures it actually will encourage<br>some regrowth but it will actually<br>depress some species and prevent them<br>from coming on and eventually reaching<br>the canopy and then of course those<br>terrible weeds that we're dealing with<br>try to scan TIA<br>some of you may know there's wandering<br>Willi or something like that<br>Grint cratis can tear a different<br>experiment here showing what happens if<br>you clear the weed if you mulch around<br>the seedling plant the late successional<br>tree are trying to establish Marsh media<br>tower or what happens if you do nothing<br>and what this research has shown is that<br>the growth rates are best when you do<br>nothing but you make sure that you put<br>the sampling in the ground at least one<br>meter height so that the tread of<br>scandia cannot overwhelm it different<br>parts of New Zealand they'll have to be<br>taller if you go to Northland that might<br>need to be a metre and a half because<br>traders can tear is even more rampant in<br>Northland that is here in the Waikato<br>and then just going back to what I<br>showed you before was seedling damaged<br>by predators what about the ongoing<br>damage for seedlings and how can you<br>improve their chances here we show a<br>closing up of the data the difference<br>between caged and clay ball treatment<br>essentially caged 15% lost clay ball 15%<br>loss so after one year you've had a<br>significant impact by just doing simple<br>things like putting a clay coating on<br>this on the seed and then there are the<br>special plants the specialized shrub<br>epiphytes the ones that actually grow up<br>in a tree and do not come into our city<br>because their dispersal agent might be<br>in low numbers it might be the carrier<br>or some other bird or because they've<br>been lost from the system and the<br>habitat in the city is so isolated and<br>so distant from the seed source that<br>they need a bit of help and this is the<br>sort of thing our team has been doing<br>and there's them some of the team there<br>there's Katherine climbing up a tree and<br>Fiona is potting up the epified and then<br>they're hosting them up into the tree<br>and reestablishing and we haven't<br>published this work yet but I know that<br>the data shows that at least 80% success<br>rate for reintroducing some of these<br>specialised shrub epiphytes<br>into the city now I've been talking a<br>lot about reconstruction and plants and<br>of course I do need to remember and<br>remind you that control of predators is<br>also important but I'm going to give it<br>a little proviso here as I move through<br>my talk so Waikato Regional Council done<br>a marvelous job of funding Hamilton<br>hallo intensive pest control 15<br>kilometer radius around the city and by<br>depressing the numbers of the Predators<br>leading to what some of us call the TUI<br>tipping point so in 2009 and people who<br>work and live around this campus here<br>know this to be true from 2009 onwards<br>till he became a very obvious component<br>of our campus after having been absent<br>for something like a hundred years<br>although the university wasn't here a<br>hundred years ago absent for a very long<br>period and now a common sight on the<br>campus so common in fact the people who<br>engage in social media stop reporting<br>them it was just a sort of a ho-hum<br>thing we knew that they were there so<br>you stopped reporting them one of the<br>perverse effects of a success like this<br>can be that we take our eye off the<br>other component the other component<br>being reconstruction of indigenous<br>habitat and success in politicians Minds<br>sometimes is not with full understanding<br>of what is needed to reconstruct a<br>complete ecosystem so that's just a<br>little word of caution other things that<br>are going on on our landscape that are<br>helping this process well I'm not a<br>great fan of the motorcar and I hate the<br>drive to Auckland but one thing I will<br>say in support of expressways and<br>motorways is the development of<br>corridors which are entirely planted up<br>with native plants these corridors have<br>proven so effective in other parts of<br>the country so in Wellington for example<br>the Wellington City Council has recently<br>introduced a rule now at known as the<br>flack setback rule a flack setback rule<br>is where you don't plant your flex<br>within a meter or<br>the edge of the motorway because if you<br>do the TUI feeding on the core out of<br>the flowering stalk of the flax will get<br>run over by a motor car so they are<br>definitely used by our native birds and<br>they are critical in reconnecting Pury<br>urban zone with the city and although<br>I'm not going to show you a picture of<br>it remember the other style of corridor<br>that is being built across most of the<br>landscape in the Waikato the riparian<br>planting zone the riparian planting zone<br>also has the same potential as a<br>biodiversity corridor to reconnect the<br>period and zone to the urban zone but<br>the riparian planting currently will<br>need to think about the principles that<br>I've been talking about successional<br>framework are you using the best<br>available species to enhance indigenous<br>habitats so when all of these things<br>start working and coming together<br>perhaps one day we will have the tang of<br>species for species that we mostly<br>treasure the the species that are most<br>susceptible to predators particularly if<br>the 2050 goal of a predator free new<br>zealand comes into play but again I'm<br>making the plea don't just focus on the<br>birds remember the whole of the<br>ecosystem<br>one day when we put the predator proof<br>fence around Wi-Fi curriki we will be<br>able to start reintroducing birds like<br>the Tiki for example the recipe that<br>I've outlined though will be different<br>for different cities around New Zealand<br>here in Hamilton it's about restoring<br>our gullies linking them to the river<br>the lakes and the forest remnants we<br>know that we have a potential of<br>something like 800 hectares these are<br>the old figures for Hamilton City nine<br>thousand four hundred and twenty seven<br>hippies I think we're over ten thousand<br>now we've got about eight point six<br>percent of our area sitting there<br>available for reconstruction that means<br>we can start competing head-on with New<br>Plymouth right and it should be a<br>competition because that will probably<br>get the result<br>we want i know however that the people<br>in your planet know that we're up to<br>this and they are also working on major<br>projects right now to take their 8.9% to<br>15% so we're going to have to keep<br>working we have made good progress in<br>Hamilton City but we have taken our foot<br>off the accelerator we've restored about<br>10 hectares and five or six years ago I<br>thought an estimate of what we'd been<br>doing in gullies was something we had<br>reconstruction underway over an area of<br>about 190 hectares but we have taken our<br>foot off the accelerator largely due to<br>the lack of funding that is being put<br>into the gulley restoration program I<br>think the gulley restoration program<br>needs revival alongside the work that<br>we're doing at Wi-Fi creaky and then we<br>truly could head for that 10% goal we<br>know what the constraints are we've<br>worked on what the constraints are we<br>know what the limitations are and we can<br>do something about them I'm not going to<br>talk about all of them I just wanted to<br>remind you of some of the some of the<br>most difficult ones the altered soil you<br>know the altered soil the altered<br>climate the pollutants in the system but<br>these are all things we can deal with<br>and of course the overarching problem of<br>social acceptance for things like<br>predator control and the lack of<br>ecological knowledge so even now with<br>all of the work that's been going on<br>people still don't know enough about the<br>species that could be used most<br>effectively for reconstruction of<br>indigenous habitats the opportunities<br>though way by far outweigh the<br>constraints above all the city is the<br>place where you can get intensive human<br>intervention you can mobilize the people<br>at other day you can mobilize them in<br>various places you have the advantage of<br>the lack of grazing animals that occur<br>in the period and in rural zone and some<br>of the Predators not all of them but a<br>few of them are less common things like<br>the weasels and States but above all the<br>city is the place where you can<br>you know this is the Nexus of people and<br>the environment where you can get<br>coordinated interagency action and you<br>can get that convergence of disciplines<br>and capability that can lead to<br>achieving the 10% threshold and although<br>I'm a biodiversity freak if you like the<br>benefits are way beyond biodiversity all<br>of the things that this sort of<br>restoration and reconstruction can<br>contribute are listed this is just a<br>sample of the main things that this will<br>achieve for our city and the one that I<br>rate the highest of all is the fourth<br>bullet point down social cohesion the<br>value of having projects and cities<br>where people come together people of all<br>ethnic persuasions of all age groups<br>focused on achieving and goal that they<br>can all work together on and I think in<br>2002 it was McKinney he said providing a<br>well-informed public could be the most<br>important application of urban ecology<br>so when I posed the question of the<br>beginning you knew it was rhetorical<br>right you knew that you knew that I<br>already believed that even restoration<br>is the new frontier and we're starting<br>to do some more work in the space here<br>at the University of Waikato that I'm<br>just going to briefly finish off on so<br>we know from our own previous work that<br>there's more to be done<br>and so with we put in an application to<br>M be the major funding agency recently<br>and we were very lucky to get some<br>additional new money we also know that<br>the government has recognized the<br>importance of working in environments in<br>urban centers and that's demonstrated by<br>the inclusion of the theme on urban in<br>the new environment science roadmap so<br>there will be more funding to come I'm<br>sure and we'll have to have our eye on<br>that here in the Waikato and see if we<br>can build build our expertise and<br>capability in this space the goal of all<br>of this work will be to enhance the<br>interdisciplinary breadth of our<br>and the connection between restoration<br>practice and restoration theory and we<br>really do need to strengthen that<br>connection all the good people out there<br>doing the work making sure that the<br>science is sitting underneath and behind<br>to back it up here is the program that's<br>about to start it started actually only<br>in the last few weeks and this is just a<br>sense of what it contains urban<br>restoration planning you know why that<br>one's there after my talk tonight some<br>work on lizards some work on predator<br>profiles the role of Mauryan cultural<br>values for restoration projects even<br>green space benefits and cross-sectoral<br>alliances you know the role of business<br>and philanthropy in coming in behind all<br>of this work so the question I really<br>want to pose for you all tonight as<br>hamiltonians<br>are we actually doing enough we're doing<br>some good work but are we doing enough I<br>believe that if we came back here in<br>2050 if we mobilized appropriately that<br>Hamilton can be a sustainable and<br>biophilic City by a phallic nature<br>loving loving of indigenous native<br>plants whatever you want to call it we<br>are sitting in a place where we can make<br>a massive contribution in this area I<br>also believe that cities will determine<br>the fate of the remaining biodiversity<br>of our regions and our nation and the<br>planet and that there will be no<br>sustainable world without sustainable<br>cities I just want to finish by<br>acknowledging a whole bunch of people<br>I'm not going to list it off they can<br>read it and they'll see themselves<br>mentioned they're important people but<br>there is one person that I will mention<br>and that's my wife Beth who's sitting in<br>the audience here she is my major<br>scientific collaborator my major<br>critique ax the major person who keeps<br>me on track and I would also invite you<br>to consider the last bullet point if<br>there's something in the talk tonight<br>that you want to know more about<br>there is a review paper that was<br>published in 2016 by myself and<br>Catherine Kirby here in the audience<br>tonight in the general ecological<br>management and restoration and you can<br>read more about it thank you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
