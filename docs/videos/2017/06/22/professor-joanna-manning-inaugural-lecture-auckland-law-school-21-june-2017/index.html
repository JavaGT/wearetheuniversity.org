injury in the UK, Australia and New Zealand: A legal and ethical audit.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is Janet McLain and it's my<br>great pleasure to welcome you this<br>evening to Professor Joanna Manning's<br>inaugural lecture professor mening<br>undertook clear ba LLB honors here at<br>Auckland University where she excelled<br>across a range of subjects from criminal<br>law tort law contract law to<br>administrative law<br>she received a host of prizes including<br>winning the coveted staff shield after<br>postgraduate study in the United States<br>on a rotary scholarship she worked for<br>some time as a crown prosecutor before<br>joining the faculty at Auckland her<br>strengths in both public and private law<br>continued to show through and she's<br>taught a range of subjects from tort law<br>to administrative law combining her<br>teaching was bringing up three children<br>and serving for a time as lay member on<br>the Medical Practitioners<br>disciplinary committee the letter was<br>her first foray into medical law which<br>would subsequently become the area in<br>which she distinguished herself and<br>established his scholarship nationally<br>and internationally it's an area in<br>which she's able to combine her broad<br>legal expertise with a deep interest and<br>moral questions compassion and a sense<br>of justice she's also become legendary<br>and the faculty is knowing a huge range<br>of medical procedures and symptoms and<br>some detail and though as a good tort<br>lawyer she would never hold herself out<br>as giving medical advice she would and<br>she can always recommend who not to go<br>professor Manning is an exemplary<br>colleague academic friends and professor<br>of law and I now invite her to address<br>you Thank You Kenneth<br>for your overly generous remarks I got a<br>text from my younger middle son earlier<br>on today saying good luck for your<br>inauguration as president tonight mama<br>SFF but I do feel privileged in having<br>two very dear friends and long-standing<br>colleagues to both introduce and to<br>close my mixer tonight thank you both no<br>my hire a my welcome to your honor the<br>Dean my colleagues my cat right<br>collector friends some of whom are here<br>tonight here's a recent photo of them in<br>particular I want to acknowledge and<br>dedicate my lecture tonight whoo Linda<br>Williams she's the one in the middle<br>holding the flowers we were celebrating<br>her new years on earth this year in<br>recognition of her enormous and tireless<br>work over decades on behalf of New<br>Zealand health consumers especially<br>women it was Linda who alerted me to<br>this rather worried and worrisome topic<br>that I'm addressing tonight having<br>learned about it she had learned about<br>it from attending ethics committees and<br>dhb committees for years on behalf of<br>the Auckland Women's Health Council<br>thank you for your work Linda<br>welcome also to friends to neighbors to<br>my biking buddies and family and thank<br>you all for making the effort to come<br>out tonight tonight is the longest night<br>the darkest night of the year and it<br>would have been easy to stay home in<br>front of the fire I know that I was very<br>tempted to do so but myself<br>ffs but it is a real privilege to<br>present this lecture to give this<br>lecture in front of one's peers and<br>family so I thought I would take a<br>moment to introduce you to some members<br>of my family some of whom are here<br>tonight<br>here's my wonderful mother proof um with<br>my father Jack around the time of my<br>birth she sadly died prematurely in 1992<br>and she would have loved to have been<br>here as Jenna and I have off often<br>discuss who's got the similar mother<br>that she would put on the dog if she was<br>here tonight and here's me and my older<br>brother bill who should be here but he's<br>always he's legendary in the family for<br>being late<br>I'm the angelic one and he's the one<br>with the family ears and here's the<br>great architect my father Jack of whom<br>I'm incredibly proud with his biggest<br>direction in Wellington off<br>and Jack and the downpipe that's the<br>outrageously expensive down pipe that he<br>designed for us which nearly brought our<br>marriage to an end and the photo was<br>taken by my dear friend Judy Drock<br>season who's in the audience and what<br>else have I got to show you here's<br>husband Tony who does not want to be<br>acknowledged I don't think he's here<br>tonight are you serious and much loved a<br>much loved three much loved but rather<br>wayward children plus one of their<br>partners I've been blessed with<br>encouragement support and love from all<br>of these people and since 1986 wonderful<br>supportive colleagues who just keep<br>getting better and better more<br>impressive and more professional every<br>year it seems and here's a photo of them<br>last year they are the truth tell honor<br>of the floor school thank you to you in<br>1978 the UK Royal Commission on<br>compensation and civil liability known<br>as the Pearson Commission had this to<br>say of volunteers and medical research<br>we think it is wrong that a person who<br>exposes himself to some medical risk in<br>the interests of the community should<br>have to rely on X Crusher compensation<br>in the event of injury and yet nearly 40<br>years later that's actually the position<br>that most injured participants are in<br>medical research in Australia New<br>Zealand and the UK find themselves in if<br>they are injured in<br>medical research and because the<br>information about the compensation<br>arrangement in place for the clinical<br>trial that subjects receive in many<br>instances is inadequate it's highly<br>likely that they only discover their<br>financial exposure after they're injured<br>and they make a claim for compensation<br>so a bit of a road map that looks an<br>awful lot and I stand between you and a<br>drink so I hope it won't be too long but<br>first of all I'll explain the difference<br>between my biomedical research and<br>ordinary medical care and we look at the<br>incidence of research related injury<br>I'll make the ethical argument in favor<br>of a societal moral obligation to<br>compensate for research related injury<br>and argue that no-fault compensation is<br>the best ethical response then we'll do<br>a brief survey of the three<br>jurisdictions in relation to both<br>publicly funded that taxpayer funded<br>clinical trials and commercially funded<br>pharmaceutically funded trials look at<br>the recommended information about the<br>compensation arrangements in place that<br>potential subjects are given in each<br>jurisdiction and finally outline some<br>remedial and reform options but it's<br>important first to appreciate the<br>difference between medical research and<br>ordinary medical care<br>each has very different goals ordinary<br>medical treatment aims to benefit an<br>individual patient the doctor weighs the<br>potential risks against the benefits of<br>an intervention and recommends a<br>tailored regimen only where the benefits<br>outweigh the risks of<br>that individual in contrast the sole<br>goal of clinical research is to benefit<br>future patients the aim is not to<br>benefit the current research subjects so<br>even in therapeutic research where the<br>medicine has been tested on patients who<br>have the condition that the medicine has<br>been developed to treat and decide as a<br>possibility that they might derive a<br>personal and individual benefit the aim<br>of the clinical trial is not to benefit<br>them if they do benefit that's a<br>secondary and an incidental lucky<br>outcome it's not a gay a goal an aim of<br>the research the pharmaceutical trials<br>industry in New Zealand is big estimated<br>at forty five million dollars per annum<br>in 2001 and growing the aim is that it<br>should generate two hundred and forty<br>fifty million dollars per annum by 2020<br>in 2011 government was concerned that<br>New Zealand had lost its competitive<br>advantage as a good place to carry out<br>clinical trials mainly to Australia and<br>it took various initiatives<br>one of which was streamlining the ethics<br>approval process to improve the<br>environment for conducting clinical<br>trials in New Zealand since 2012 it's<br>estimated that about 50,000 and New<br>Zealanders had participated in clinical<br>research and in 2016<br>about 240 applications were made for<br>Ethics approval for intervention studies<br>most for<br>studies funded by pharmaceutical or<br>medical device companies and of course<br>society's interests are advanced by<br>ongoing medical research and people's<br>participation in it the greatest benefit<br>is obviously to future patients who<br>suffer from disease or injury through<br>the availability of a constant stream of<br>new and improved medicines which have<br>increased life expectancies improved<br>quality of life and reduced rates of<br>morbidity but the population as a whole<br>benefits from advances in knowledge<br>medical and scientific knowledge even if<br>a particular medicine turns out on<br>balance not to be beneficial and it is<br>not brought to market<br>all new medicines have to be tested for<br>the first time on healthy people after<br>which they are tested on smaller than<br>larger groups of patient volunteers<br>before the medicine can be registered<br>and marketed so these advances and<br>medical treatments come at a cost<br>to a minority of research subjects who<br>suffer research related injury we're all<br>aware of the highly publicized notorious<br>cases of deaths and catastrophic<br>injuries<br>the French BR disaster last year which<br>left one participant brain dead and five<br>others critically ill and then of course<br>the so-called Elephant Man clinical<br>trial the Norfolk Park study in 2006 in<br>which six healthy men took a new<br>medicine in a phase one trial and within<br>12 hours of taking it medicine suffered<br>multi organ failure and some of them<br>continue to suffer long<br>health problems but harm that's never<br>widely publicized as cause to a small<br>number of participants in routine<br>clinical research and so for example in<br>2012 and New Zealand our two men who<br>were participants in separate<br>pharmaceutical company trials suffered<br>serious injury one trial involved a man<br>who was involved in a gout trial who<br>suffered atrial fibrillation days after<br>taking a new gout medicine and to my<br>knowledge he's never worked again the<br>other was involved in an insulin trial<br>testing a new variant of an insulin<br>medicine against an existing medicine<br>and he suffered permanent and very<br>after taking after participating in a<br>trial<br>Dover's little recent data on the<br>incidence of research related injury<br>it's claimed to be low in incidence the<br>biggest study is quite an old one 1976<br>on about 130,000 patients and it showed<br>that the risk associated with non<br>therapeutic research was estimated to be<br>no greater than that experienced in<br>everyday life I guess that might depend<br>on what you do in your everyday life and<br>that in therapeutic research no greater<br>than that an ordinary medical treatment<br>there are two main opposing views about<br>whether there's an ethical requirement<br>to compensate for research related<br>injury the argument that there's no such<br>obligation proceeds from the principle<br>of autonomy<br>or liberty and it holds that providing<br>subjects have been clearly and<br>accurately informed of the risks of<br>participating in the trial and with full<br>knowledge they've given a voluntary<br>consent to participation their consent<br>constitutes a waiver of any claim for<br>compensation if they're injured but that<br>position I would suggest has been<br>convincingly rebutted for quite some<br>time it's pointed out that disclosure of<br>the risks is not the same as disclosure<br>of a legal right disclosure of the<br>absent sorry of a legal right to<br>compensation and it doesn't amount to a<br>waiver of compensation the function of<br>informed consent in the roof and the<br>research setting is merely to authorize<br>research which involves interference for<br>the person's bodily integrity to proceed<br>it doesn't shift the financial burden of<br>injury from researcher to subject the<br>most influential justification for a<br>societal moral obligation to compensate<br>for injured compensate injured research<br>subjects was advanced way back in 1976<br>by James Child recede that because<br>clinical research requires participants<br>to assume a position of risk for the<br>benefit of society and future patients<br>society therefore has a moral obligation<br>to compensate for research related<br>injury and he pointed to these three<br>features giving rise to a societal moral<br>obligation to compensate injured<br>patients I won't read them out but he<br>argued that the moral obligation exists<br>regardless of the possibility that the<br>subject might derive an<br>personal benefit from taking the<br>medicine and whatever our subjects are<br>subjective motives for participating<br>because there's uncertainty about which<br>medicine is the best the most beneficial<br>treatment or procedure and the subject<br>still accepts a position of risk for the<br>benefit of society and he included<br>industry sponsored research within the<br>moral obligation because society<br>requires drug testing for licensing and<br>registration purposes there's also a<br>consensus that no-fault compensation is<br>the best ethical response to research<br>related injury that it constitutes a<br>special case for compensation without<br>the injured subject having to prove that<br>the researcher or the funder the sponsor<br>was negligent it's well-known the poor<br>job that tort law does as a compensation<br>mechanism with no Matson's Woodhouse's<br>powerful report in 1968 particularly in<br>medical negligence cases and tort law is<br>even worse at compensating injured<br>research subjects than as as injured<br>patients and this is the two main<br>reasons there are two main reasons why<br>injured subjects chances of succeeding<br>in a court of law are very limited<br>the most serious obstacle lies improving<br>fault or negligence on behalf of<br>researchers or sponsors when injury<br>occurs it's most often because an<br>unforeseen or an unpredictable risk of<br>the trial product occurs rather than any<br>negligence or departure from the trial<br>protocol by the research team and so<br>participants are likely to experience<br>real difficulty in proving that<br>harmless reasonably foreseeable because<br>unforeseen events are to be expected in<br>experimental research the second barrier<br>is proof of the causal link between<br>subjects injury and their participation<br>in the trial this can be a real<br>challenge especially for patient<br>volunteers who have real difficulty in<br>proving that the injury was attributable<br>to the administration of the trial<br>product or some intervention required by<br>the protocol rather than their<br>underlying condition progressing or the<br>comparison medicine a side-effect of<br>that and the to New Zealand cases that I<br>talked about both many faceless<br>difficulties both some suitable<br>companies disputed that it was their<br>trial drug which caused the injury<br>it wasn't until some three years later<br>and after getting as they say lawyered<br>up that the man in the gap trial was<br>able to achieve a confidential<br>settlement with the pharmaceutical<br>company and the man and the insulin<br>trial to this day has never received any<br>compensation because the company<br>maintains that his injury was caused was<br>it was associated with his underlying<br>diabetes rather than their study than<br>their trial drug this despite<br>ministerial pressure being applied to<br>the company to go to mediation and him<br>also obtaining legal representation<br>so tort law almost always leaves injured<br>research subjects to bear the full<br>financial burden of their injuries alone<br>only no-fault compensation will<br>adequately protect them for injury for<br>which negligence can't be established<br>and so that's why a whole series<br>Riis of blue ribbon National Commission<br>and reports have recommended no-fault<br>the end international guidelines<br>similarly most notably the famous<br>Belmont report and also the Pearson<br>Report which I referred to earlier so<br>let's move to the survey of the<br>arrangements in place of the of the<br>three jurisdictions to see whether the<br>law in each of these countries measures<br>up to the ethical obligation of no-fault<br>compensation in the United Kingdom the<br>law is different in publicly funded that<br>commercially funded trials in publicly<br>funded research trials to be legally<br>entitled to compensation and injured<br>subject would have to go to court and<br>prove a legal claim against an NHS<br>funder or are an NHS staff member<br>involved in a trial either an negligence<br>or under their Consumer Guarantees Act<br>which is no mean feat as I indicated in<br>the case of non negligently inflicted<br>harm so that's where an unforeseen side<br>effect of the medicine occurs and causes<br>injury the UK government forbids NHS<br>bodies from offering advanced<br>compensation to subjects or providing<br>indignities to this our staff or NHS<br>bodies taking out compensation insurance<br>but they are permitted to offer an X<br>gracious system in exceptional<br>circumstances within a delegated limit<br>of fifty thousand pounds and so in the<br>UK injured research subjects even<br>healthy volunteers in publicly funded<br>trials<br>I'd have to establish legal liability or<br>rely on an ex<br>Grusha payment what's the position in<br>pharmaceutically funded trials the<br>pharmaceutical industry in the UK has<br>been permitted to regulate compensation<br>arrangements through a system of<br>voluntary compensation guidelines<br>sanctioned by government so for phase<br>one studies these are on healthy<br>volunteers who do not expect to benefit<br>can't benefit from the medicine the<br>member association of the pharmaceutical<br>industry which is called the association<br>of the British pharmaceutical industry<br>to a BPI they have adopted guidelines<br>that require sponsors to put in place a<br>legally enforceable commitment to pay<br>compensation to injured subjects this is<br>achieved through the terms of the<br>participant information sheet and the<br>consent form these are drafted as a<br>binding contract between the sponsor and<br>the subject there are still some<br>problems with these but there is awful<br>lot better than the compensation<br>guidelines in place for phase 2 3 &amp; 4<br>trials if you read these compensation<br>guidelines and I am reliably informed<br>you discover that they state that our<br>sponsors obligation to pay no-fault<br>compensation is without legal commitment<br>so it's a moral obligation only it's<br>unenforceable by an injured participant<br>the justification for different<br>treatment of phase 1 injuries and later<br>fade and injuries is that the former are<br>considered to be a special group of<br>research participants they expose<br>themselves to and know unusually greater<br>risks of injury and they don't they<br>expect<br>no personal benefits and so without a<br>legally binding commitment to compensate<br>them for injury the industry recognized<br>that it would be terribly hard to<br>recruit healthy volunteers drug n<br>injuries can be very expensive to<br>compensate and I suggest that it's an<br>unsatisfactory position for an injured<br>patient volunteer that the research<br>sponsor is faced with balance and cost<br>against breaching a legally<br>unenforceable albeit moral undertaking<br>and on some claims you can quite imagine<br>that the sponsoring company or maybe<br>it's overseas head office could well<br>decide that the costs are simply not<br>worth it<br>so coming to the Arrangements in this<br>part of the world Australia their<br>national statement on ethical conduct<br>and human research requires that all<br>clinical trials have appropriate<br>compensation but it doesn't specify what<br>this is to consist of the arrangements<br>for publicly funded research are complex<br>because of their federal state system<br>and I won't go into the technical detail<br>but the bottom line is that public<br>sector bodies conducting clinical trials<br>don't separately put in place no-fault<br>compensation or provide insurance or<br>indemnity to support that a subjects<br>entitlement compensation would depend on<br>proof of legal liability in<br>pharmaceutically funded clinical trials<br>in Australia and New Zealand almost<br>identical compensation guidelines to the<br>UK ones for stage two three and four<br>trials are in place with each government<br>listen they were adopted in Australia in<br>1994 because the ethics committees<br>they're increasingly demanded that our<br>sponsors agreed to abide by them but<br>they were introduced in New Zealand in<br>1993 for a very different reason<br>in 1992 government in New Zealand passed<br>a new statute governing our compensation<br>scheme and one change was to remove<br>personal injury resulting from<br>participation in a pharmaceutical<br>offender trial from a CC cover even<br>though participants in public trials<br>taxpayer-funded trials continued to have<br>a CC cover at the time government<br>government was looking to reduce the<br>costs of funding the scheme that sounds<br>familiar doesn't it and it also reasoned<br>that since our medicines which were<br>trialed on New Zealanders the profits<br>would be enjoyed by industry it should<br>pay the cost of injuries and their<br>trials so by agreeing to participate in<br>a commercially funded trial a research<br>subject surrenders their right to ACCC<br>cover and when it was belatedly realized<br>that these participants were financially<br>exposed government and the research<br>medicines industry hurriedly adopted the<br>UK compensation guideline and they were<br>put in place in 1993 one major and<br>sobering difference to the UK position<br>however is that the compensation<br>guidelines in place in New Zealand and<br>Australia these versions apply also to<br>injuries in phase one studies so healthy<br>volunteers who are injured<br>so sponsors in the UK we saw except a<br>legally enforceable compensation<br>obligation but in New Zealand and<br>Australia for unexplained reasons a<br>sponsors obligation to pay no-fault<br>compensation to participants injured in<br>a phase one trial is also without legal<br>commitment even though the British<br>member Association the a BPI has<br>accepted and it has said this in writing<br>that it's ethically appropriate to<br>provide legally enforceable compensation<br>to phase one subjects cert and it's done<br>from 1970 on occasion industry<br>associations have have reassured the<br>medical profession and ethics committees<br>but not subjects that despite that<br>without legal commitment wording they<br>would pay out if they had agreed and an<br>information sheet to abide by the<br>compensation guidelines we do in reality<br>pay out presumably the reasoning is that<br>it's not just financial but there are<br>reputational interests and a company<br>will want to protect that investment in<br>its trial product but the problem is<br>that we have no way of knowing whether<br>they do payout ethics committees are not<br>involved in the claims process and they<br>can't monitor where the claims are paid<br>and the amounts and companies guard the<br>facts of any settlement under the<br>compensation guidelines and the details<br>as confidential and commercially<br>sensitive<br>certainly you can imagine the commercial<br>realities when it's so that a company<br>agreed that it should make some payment<br>in an individual case once the injured<br>participant or his or her lawyer finds<br>out there any payment is without legal<br>commitment certainly the negotiating<br>power would shift dramatically in the<br>company's favor after learning about the<br>difficulties that the to New Zealand men<br>faced in receiving compensation New<br>Zealand's our national ethics advisory<br>committee or niak warned government<br>ministers in 2014 that it was concerned<br>that some companies may be failing to<br>comply with the requirement to pay<br>compensation for at least ACC equivalent<br>standard and in an expeditious manner so<br>what are the compensation arrangements<br>in publicly funded trials in New Zealand<br>as I said these are covered under the<br>ACCC scheme under the treatment injury<br>head of cover without the claimant<br>having to prove negligence or fault by<br>the sponsor or the researcher certainly<br>they're still going to prove that<br>causative link between injury and<br>participation in the trial and that can<br>be a real challenge but from an injured<br>subjects perspective ACCC compensation<br>is overwhelmingly superior to that under<br>the compensation guidelines the key<br>advantage is of course that it's legally<br>enforceable the amounts are fixed<br>clearly stated in the legislation rather<br>than being at the discretion of the<br>pharmaceutical company importantly they<br>include weekly compensation for lost<br>income which is often not provided under<br>the compensation guidelines<br>and in fatal cases a proportion of the<br>weekly compensation is paid through<br>partners and dependents there's a<br>statutory protease and time limits by<br>which claims are to be decided in ACCC<br>decisions can be appealed to the<br>independent courts there's nothing like<br>this under the compensation guidelines<br>under these the pharmaceutical company<br>is the final decision-maker of the claim<br>remember that the claim to which it's a<br>party with a financial interest so<br>there's a serious potential for bias and<br>so participants in pharmaceutically<br>funded industry trials are significantly<br>disadvantaged in New Zealand compared to<br>those in publicly funded trials they're<br>dependent on a sponsors voluntary<br>payment of compensation whereas the<br>latter have a legal entitlement to<br>reasonably comprehensive no-fault<br>compensation this I would submit is<br>inequitable and discriminatory since<br>once you're injured in a trial at the<br>material to you where the funding came<br>from the taxpayer or the pharmaceutical<br>company your need lies and proper<br>compensation for your injury at that<br>point so all three countries are are<br>wanting in the extent to which their law<br>measures up to their ethical<br>requirements of no-fault compensation<br>for research related injury subjects are<br>reliant on ex crusher payment or an<br>unenforceable and assurance of payment<br>following non negligent injury<br>the exceptions are publicly funded<br>trials in New Zealand and phase one<br>trials in the UK so let's look at the<br>templates for the participant<br>information sheet so this is the<br>information that appear<br>actual research subjects receives when<br>they're considering whether to enroll in<br>a clinical trial and the peak epics<br>bodies in each country have templates of<br>recommended information and wording to<br>include in the information sheets so<br>this is the UK one for a pharmaceutical<br>II funded Phase two three and four trial<br>remember that in these are sponsors<br>obligation is legally unenforceable I<br>folded the two sentences there this does<br>at least say that any payment would be<br>without a legal commitment although it<br>might be hard for a potential<br>participant to reconcile the first<br>folded sentence and the second bolded<br>sentence here's the Australian health<br>ethics committee committee's recommended<br>wording for a commercially funded trial<br>I bolded the relevant sentence the<br>purely voluntary nature of the<br>obligation to pay no-fault compensation<br>could be made more explicit I would<br>suggest using the words without legal<br>commitment would would be as much<br>clearer it could well be that a<br>reasonable person contemplating<br>enrolling in the trial might interpret<br>that sentence as depending on whether<br>the terms of the compensation guidelines<br>apply to their case rather than the<br>compensation guide like the obligation<br>being voluntary but the New Zealand<br>health ethics committees recommended<br>wording is far and away the worst<br>offender the overall message here is<br>that conference you wouldn't you do I<br>get a CC compensation but<br>that compensation would be available<br>from the study sponsor instead of ACC<br>compensation if something was to go<br>wrong there's nothing here to put a<br>subject on notice that a sponsors<br>obligation is a moral one only that it's<br>without legal commitment which I suggest<br>that you just read that would come as a<br>shock to you if you were injured and<br>went looking for compensation there's<br>even a suggestion in the last sentence<br>that a subject unhappy with the amount<br>of compensation that a pharmaceutical<br>company was prepared to give to you and<br>you could go to court and authority of<br>lis challenge the amount of compensation<br>and a court could make a legal ruling<br>determining the appropriate amount of<br>compensation which of course is totally<br>incorrect subject to a we argument that<br>I'll come to in a minute the guideline<br>for compensation guidelines aren't named<br>and they're not given to subjects and<br>they say ask for them so I would suggest<br>give them that those words without legal<br>commitment are in the compensation<br>guidelines and they are critical for a<br>petitioner participants legal rights<br>they should get a copy and it should be<br>put in front of their eyes and explain<br>to them the cheers of the health are the<br>ethics committees in New Zealand have<br>written to me to tell me that just<br>template is being revised to better<br>inform participants that the obligation<br>is voluntary and not enforceable and<br>Minister Peter Dunne has told me that<br>this is expected to be completed by the<br>end of September so they don't appear to<br>be in any hurry at the very least I<br>would suggest that if ethics committees<br>continue to<br>to approve research on the basis of the<br>compensation guidelines they must insist<br>that researchers and sponsors spell out<br>accurately and in the clearest of terms<br>a subjects lack of any legal right to<br>no-fault compensation in the event<br>they're injured so that the issue<br>becomes part of their overall informed<br>consent this would merely ensure that<br>people would go into trials with their<br>eyes open of course and it may well<br>negatively impact on recruitment it<br>would do nothing to address the<br>underlying problem that they've got no<br>legal right to no-fault compensation so<br>what responses and options are available<br>to try to bring the legal requirement up<br>to match the ethical requirements the<br>lawyers in this audience will have been<br>whispering to themselves that there must<br>surely be scope for an injured<br>participant to argue that a contract<br>exists between the subject and the<br>sponsor based on the information sheet<br>and the signed consent form despite the<br>absence of legal commitment wording of<br>the guidelines<br>Peter Watts is looking incredibly<br>askance at this you told me that he<br>doesn't think this argument holds any<br>water at all but we shall see after all<br>some participants are paid to<br>participate the the usual legal<br>principle is that courts except that<br>agreements which are stated to be<br>binding in honor only are not legally<br>binding is contracts because the parties<br>don't have an intention to create<br>legally binding relations but where the<br>effect of a clause has been<br>misrepresented the cause excluding legal<br>liability has been misrepresented<br>it won't operate even if it's been<br>signed by a party that is a sort to be<br>bound by it and I would suggest that at<br>the moment the standard text in the New<br>Zealand template information sheet<br>doesn't just omit those words without<br>legal commitment<br>it actually wrongly and misleadingly<br>suggests that compensation enforceable<br>by a court would be in place instead of<br>a CC cover if something were to go wrong<br>and so I suggest that injured subjects<br>may have a cause of action and contract<br>or the equitable principle of promissory<br>estoppel for a remedy which would have<br>the effect of enforcing a sponsors<br>obligation to pay no-fault compensation<br>it wouldn't be a straightforward claim<br>you'd have to convince the court that<br>the subject actually relied on the<br>explanation and the information sheet<br>and they wouldn't have been to the trial<br>if they had no in the true position the<br>second option our knee acts ethical<br>guidance and the operating procedures in<br>place put a duty on ethics committees to<br>check that ACC equivalent compensation<br>is in place for a commercially funded<br>trial in place of ACC cover since<br>research can't proceed without ethics<br>approval it's within the power of ethics<br>committees to make their approval of<br>research conditional on them being<br>satisfied that a legally enforceable ACC<br>equivalent compensation arrangement is<br>in place and so I suggest that ethics<br>committees should be fully prepared<br>especially where the risks of a trial<br>are more than negligible to withhold<br>approval of research unless they're<br>satisfied that<br>a legally enforceable compensation<br>arrangement in place governments guilty<br>of speaking out of both sides of its<br>mouth on the one hand it wants to<br>encourage the industry and it's put<br>ethics committees under very real<br>pressure to approve trials within very<br>short timeframes but on the other hand<br>FX committees can be very sure that if<br>anything goes wrong it's they who will<br>be blamed for failing to protect<br>patients in response to me acts concern<br>that I referred to earlier sounded to<br>ministers our government officials had<br>this to say to the minister's ethics<br>committee shouldn't be approving trials<br>unless they're satisfied that<br>appropriate compensation arrangements<br>have been made the regulatory framework<br>may not be sufficiently robust to ensure<br>the welfare of participants and could be<br>reviewed the third option it submitted<br>that the most ethically defensible and<br>effective reform option for compensating<br>for research related injury is a<br>no-fault compensation scheme operating<br>outside the tort system in New Zealand<br>the answer seems pretty obvious and<br>straightforward to achieve to extend ACC<br>cover to cover the small group of<br>research participants in commercially<br>funded trials by removing their<br>exclusion from ACC cover so that they<br>treated equally with all other research<br>participants in New Zealand so far<br>government ministers have been<br>unpersuaded of the merits of the<br>suggestion in the UK in Australia they<br>don't have a state funded compensation<br>scheme and so such a reform option would<br>be much more difficult to achieve but a<br>scheme could operate outside the tort<br>system via a private fund administered<br>by a body such as a board and financed<br>by those who benefit<br>from biomedical research there's<br>certainly a valid concern that if the<br>pharmaceutical industry is able to shift<br>its costs of compensating for injuries<br>on to the compensation scheme and it<br>doesn't have to internalize those costs<br>in its financial risk-benefit calculus<br>this would Lance<br>and centers on them to conduct safe<br>studies would New Zealand be targeted by<br>pharmaceutical companies seeking to<br>conduct questionable trials this is the<br>key policy reason officials government<br>officials advised ministers against<br>extending ACC cover to participants<br>injured in commercially funded trials<br>which ministers accepted but I suggest<br>that there are very effective means<br>alternative means of maintaining<br>appropriate levels of the appearance on<br>the pharmaceutical industry all<br>companies are conducting trials in New<br>Zealand are required to have clinical<br>trials insurance if ACC cover was<br>extended to industry trials<br>pharmaceutical companies would be simply<br>exchanging an insurance premium for a<br>contribution to the ACCC scheme via<br>payment of a living livvie rates could<br>be calculated according to a sponsor<br>safety record and its claims experience<br>as a means of achieving greater<br>deterrence and concerns about under<br>deterrence could also be addressed by<br>giving ACC a statutory right of<br>subrogation so that it could stand in<br>the shoes of the injured claimant<br>participant and pursue in the public<br>interest in illegal claims that the<br>subject would have had<br>against the commercial sponsor including<br>for example for punitive damages in<br>egregious cases and so in conclusion<br>it's my submission to you this evening<br>that the ethical corollary of the fact<br>that society is the ultimate beneficiary<br>of its members participation and medical<br>research is that society as a whole<br>should bear the costs of participant<br>Indus injuries through the establishment<br>of a central no-fault Compensation Fund<br>in this country we are very fortunate<br>their scheme already exists the only<br>serious inequity being that it doesn't<br>cover subjects ended in pharmaceutically<br>finders funded clinical trials thank you<br>stay here so I can praise you in<br>humiliation when I say some weird<br>offense tonight I insisted on seeing<br>Joe's CV C and I started here a city of<br>so years ago so I know a lot about Joba<br>she's the classic T we understated so I<br>thought it was I should see her CV and<br>it is a remarkable CV and I start shield<br>for instance with Janet mentioned I was<br>unaware of her senior scholar as a<br>student but all through life she's been<br>a great achiever and the real Trojan<br>when it comes to service both to the<br>University and the community she's not<br>very tolerant of malingerers at the<br>faculty or elsewhere and that we where<br>there's genuine need Joe will be there<br>she's an incredibly kind person and a<br>doer and she's been involved in the<br>community as we've had some of these<br>things over 20 you know about 20 years<br>of ministerial appointments medical<br>practitioners disciplinary committee<br>National Committee on health and<br>disability support services ethics<br>committee and she she's been played a<br>brave role in relation to the Cartwright<br>matter and she showed bravery again<br>tonight I think in the talk we've heard<br>it sounds us to me a bit like an<br>economic race to the bottom has been<br>going on and it's time that was<br>straightened out and I think we should<br>all be very grateful for bringing it to<br>our attention so it's been a very<br>popular teacher in the faculty across a<br>range of subjects including key<br>compulsory subjects torts which is just<br>she had a severe procedure output which<br>is a course a key factor in appointment<br>to a chair she's performed nearly every<br>function within the faculty including<br>deputy Dean and the short spell is<br>acting D so sure that she's what more<br>could one wants in an academic colleague<br>superb academic record a scholar and a<br>contributor to administration she's also<br>a person of an impeachable integrity<br>rather too much information sometimes on<br>top of here formal contributions to the<br>faculty and one of one of her greatest<br>contributions to those around her has<br>been her sense of humour some of which<br>we've had tonight she's always making us<br>laugh both intentionally and<br>unintentionally here intentional<br>humorous at the expense of people such<br>as a sinking today is well colleague<br>Rick big one is like the humor of Tony<br>and repeatable I'm afraid it's for<br>unintentional you made a note that she<br>and Tony do a lot of fishing Gannett<br>falling apart<br>but Joe is very good with a gas back in<br>Auckland as well<br>anyway we've had a very interesting and<br>typically intelligent talk tonight and<br>I'm very happy therefore to ask you to<br>join me in rejoicing with Joe's<br>wonderful family in her appointment as<br>professor and congratulating us a deal</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
