these and to enhance our<br>contribution to future generations of<br>graduates and to our nation the<br>university must do three things first we<br>need to attract students of high<br>academic potential and give them an<br>outstanding academic and extracurricular<br>experience in this respect we are doing<br>very well the proportion of students<br>entering the university with a high<br>grade point average is growing each year<br>and we produce outstanding students just<br>like you second we need to attract<br>develop and retain outstanding staff<br>this we are doing is illustrated by<br>achievements I described earlier many of<br>our staff are world leaders in their<br>fields and you will have been privileged<br>to learn from and work with them it is<br>no coincidence that in the qsr world<br>rankings of university subjects the<br>University of Auckland came top in New<br>Zealand and 37 of the 44 subjects<br>ranked and I note that we don't even<br>teach four of them nor is it a<br>coincidence that we were ranked top and<br>Australasia for innovation by a recent<br>Reuters survey of asia-pacific<br>universities and third we need to create<br>the kind of academic environment and<br>facilities that support and encourage<br>excellence to the send the University<br>has been investing heavily in its campus<br>renewal program so as to ensure that we<br>do provide facilities of genuinely<br>many of you will graduate today were the<br>first qualification and you will be<br>rightly proud of this achievement<br>however I want you to reflect on the<br>ongoing learning opportunities and the<br>wide range of postgraduate options<br>available to you at this University you<br>must never rest on your laurels in a<br>challenging and ever-changing world but<br>rather be prepared to embrace change and<br>new technology and make the most of the<br>opportunities presented to you although<br>it may seem a daunting prospect right<br>now further study and learning is<br>inevitable for all of us as the world<br>changes around us at an<br>ever-accelerating pace whatever path you<br>follow I urge you as alumni of New<br>Zealand's leading University to never<br>forget your alma mater your University<br>we rely on our graduates for support<br>moral political and financial but today<br>is your day with the focus firmly on<br>your achievement at this ceremony we<br>honor your success along with the<br>support of your family Farnell and<br>others who have sustained you through<br>your studies I congratulate you and<br>trust that you will long cherish the<br>memories of your graduation today it is<br>my pleasure to welcome our guest speaker<br>this afternoon Myles Gregory as the<br>artistic director and founder of the<br>multi award-winning pop-up globe Myles<br>has been instrumental in bringing<br>Shakespeare to the people of this city<br>in a way never before experienced the<br>pop-up globe is a full-scale temporary<br>working replica of the second Globe<br>Theatre in London which produces<br>spectacular classical performance last<br>year's inaugural season in Auckland<br>marking the 400th anniversary of<br>Shakespeare's death attracted more than<br>100,000 people<br>and a season that was extended by<br>popular demand almost as soon as it<br>began the audience's including many<br>students and staff from this University<br>welcomed the first opportunity some 1642<br>to experience the dimensions of the<br>famed theatre firsthand the remarkable<br>success of the pop-up globe reflects not<br>just miles as enduring devotion to<br>Shakespeare but also his passion for<br>creating and sustaining healthy arts<br>organisations through his auckland-based<br>think-tank and cultural consultancy hems<br>lower vine is exploring best and new<br>practices in artistic management<br>including strategy governance audience<br>development marketing and programming<br>previously he was chief executive

Philosophy from<br>Bristol University specializing in<br>Shakespeare and performance close to<br>modernist aesthetics and the paradigm<br>change theory miles it's a very<br>impressive resume and we very much look<br>forward to what you have to tell us this<br>afternoon<br>Chancellor acting vice-chancellor<br>members of council members of the<br>university graduates families and<br>friends it is an honor to address you<br>today and I offer today's graduates my<br>warmest congratulations<br>today you end one unforgettable journey<br>and commence another as they say in<br>theater this is not a dress rehearsal<br>although we certainly have some splendid<br>costumes on yes my own undergraduate<br>graduation took place at the University<br>of Durham in the north of England in a<br>very cold and large hall and during the<br>ceremony the the man on my right<br>acquaintance of mine he had he been out<br>the night before for his stag party and<br>he was getting married the very next day<br>from one institution to another and<br>during the the Chancellor's speech Sir<br>Peter Ustinov he was suddenly and<br>violently sick and regrettably it was<br>the contamination spread a long way and<br>we were at the rear of the very large<br>hall and to be de small thought that<br>someone was heckling him and made some<br>choice remarks about undergraduates<br>today I hope you won't heckle me in any<br>way today as artists and I know that<br>there is a wide range of graduates here<br>today but as artists and as creatives as<br>University graduates you have the<br>opportunity to change the world and I<br>think it's natural today to consider<br>your hopes and your dreams and your<br>vision for your lives and also to make<br>time for reflection and of course<br>celebration I recently caught up with an<br>old friends who describes himself as an<br>actor and has hit<br>and has worked as a chef now for nearly<br>20 years we talked about mutual<br>acquaintances for a while and then as it<br>always does our talk turned to the<br>feature film he is desperate to make a<br>film that he has been talking about for<br>nearly 20 years and after hearing about<br>his new ideas for the film how brilliant<br>it will be how it will change the way we<br>think about film<br>I asked him what steps he was actively<br>taking to bring the film to production<br>well I know exactly how to do it he said<br>but I'm just too busy at work at the<br>moment I've spent most of my adult life<br>in fact as I left University producing<br>and directing theater productions of the<br>works of Shakespeare I think of myself<br>as an artist who understands the<br>business of theater my current role is<br>as artistic director of pop-up globe my<br>team and I very proud of our theater the<br>fact that we've recorded 185,000<br>attendances there since we opened last<br>year and also the 35,000 school students<br>and their teachers from all over New<br>Zealand who've attended productions<br>they're like all theater projects and he<br>like most things in life this one<br>started with an idea I talked about my<br>idea honestly with my friends for six<br>months and then took some action the<br>language of making theater is frequently<br>linked to the idea of action I work with<br>actors people who act for a living to<br>act is to do just that to take action to<br>do something and the string of events<br>that happen in any play are often<br>referred to as the action of the play<br>divided of course into acts and play<br>cannot be made without actors and action<br>and an audience<br>and Shakespeare shows himself in his<br>writing to be deeply interested in<br>acting in acts and action and also in<br>what happens when we know what we should<br>do but do nothing<br>his most famous character Hamlet is a<br>student who finds that he prefers to<br>talk about his problems rather than to<br>take action to solve them<br>he knows precisely what he should do<br>like my friend the actor chef but he<br>finds it very hard to act in fact you'd<br>rather just talk about it and of course<br>he's not the only one if to do where as<br>easy as to know what were good to do<br>then chapel's had been churches and poor<br>men's cottages Prince's palaces so says<br>Portia to her friend and servant Larissa<br>in the Merchant of Venice if to do where<br>as easy as to know what were good to do<br>chapels had been churches and poor men's<br>cottages Prince's palaces it's easy for<br>us to know what's good to do like Hamlet<br>I believe we all know inherently what's<br>right and what's wrong and more<br>importantly we're all born with the<br>power to dream to create gorgeous<br>visions of how the future should unfold<br>to know what were good for us to do for<br>ourselves as well as what we're good for<br>us to do in the world but achieving what<br>we've set out to do the doing of the<br>dream the action that we must take to<br>make the dream reality well this is much<br>more difficult and this is Porsha's<br>point if the act of doing where as easy<br>as knowing what we should do the world<br>would be a very different place and we<br>might be very different too<br>but there's another meaning in this line<br>that the act of doing may not always<br>achieve the expected result but it<br>always achieves something nothing will<br>come of nothing when we act when we do<br>rather than just talk about it we will<br>always achieve a result and with<br>persistence particularly following<br>failure results improve we want to build<br>a grand Church but instead we build a<br>beautiful Chapel we set out to build a<br>palace and we managed to build a cozy<br>cottage but we still end up with a<br>cottage or a chapel rather than just a<br>bare piece of land how different is this<br>from the person who takes no action does<br>nothing and achieves nothing if to do<br>were as easy as to know what were good<br>to do chapels had been churches and poor<br>men's cottages Prince's palaces now as<br>artists as graduates it's our job to<br>make work to make us or indeed to make<br>whatever your professional career throws<br>at you but it's not enough just to think<br>about it or talk about it we must act<br>very often as artists we're invited to<br>theorize about our practice whether this<br>involves writing an introduction to a<br>piece of theatre we've directed or the<br>text that hangs alongside a piece of ass<br>to be eloquent is important to be able<br>to speak fluently and persuasively about<br>our plans and work is very important I<br>believe that truth comes from honest<br>conversation between friends from big<br>dreams and as artists we should seek out<br>opportunities to discuss our work but it<br>is action that defines us as long as we<br>do what we're good to do what we know to<br>be right for ourselves and the world we<br>mustn't spend too long sitting around<br>talking whether it's writing a novel or<br>building a pop-up globe it's<br>that will be truly eloquent action is<br>eloquence<br>it's action that defines us and makes us<br>action is eloquence more Shakespeare<br>from Coriolanus<br>if we get a right our action our work<br>will speak for itself if we get it right<br>it will speak so clearly and with such<br>eloquence that our art or our action<br>will transform the lives of others and<br>help our society to understand itself in<br>ways that we can't even begin to imagine<br>I congratulate you all on your<br>graduation in my life there have been<br>six very important events I have three<br>degrees each of those graduations meant<br>a huge amount to me and I have three<br>children and of course there's one other<br>event that's the most important which<br>was the day I got married to my wife I<br>look forward with excitement to seeing<br>you take action as citizens as artists<br>and I look forward to hearing your work<br>Thank You miles for a most interesting<br>and
