that he dearly<br>loves<br>those are the introductions now remind<br>me of the format for today that's you're<br>telling me then you if you will have an<br>open dialogue it's all about 15 minutes<br>each right and then you take it from<br>there<br>all right in that case thanks everyone<br>for coming we appreciate it and we will<br>Sakura yeah long time since we had our<br>last dialogue I think it was in the who<br>was it in the northern Club yes if when<br>Raj and I did a joint course we he very<br>kindly allowed me to do my services bit<br>in the real trade part in his real trade<br>course and it's lovely to have you back<br>again and I'm sorry I'm not here for<br>more of your truck but I'm sure you'll<br>be back maybe before I retire have to<br>make it quick and the students who I am<br>sure have had a really stimulating time<br>in your course as well as some refugees<br>from my old course and some existing<br>students I'm not going to talk a lot of<br>detail around the trans-pacific<br>partnership agreement because you can<br>read that in Rogers book and I'm more<br>interested at present in understanding<br>the dynamics that are surrounding the<br>TPPA and the other mega regional<br>agreements I just come back from Beijing<br>on Saturday where we've been having<br>discussions around the relationship<br>between<br>of those big agreements and some of the<br>other ones that are being negotiated<br>with in Asia and those discussions are<br>happening everywhere in the world now so<br>it's a really turbulent vibrant and<br>slightly scary time and so I want to<br>paint a bit of a picture some of which<br>will I think coincide with some of what<br>Rice's and some of which one which is<br>what dialogues about have you spent<br>seven years dealing with the turgid text<br>of the trans-pacific partnership<br>agreement I found it was always<br>important to try to step back and ask<br>what is it that they're trying to<br>achieve here and as lawyers we can<br>sometimes get a bit lost in the details<br>of the text and certainly the poor<br>negotiators finds that problem because<br>their KPIs are actually delivering on<br>the text and even when they feel a bit<br>awkward about some of what they are<br>negotiating they have a job to do our<br>job as academics is to challenge some of<br>what's on paper sometimes but difficult<br>when the negotiations are secret but<br>helped when they leak like a sip in the<br>case of the TPP it was a partial suit<br>another of the negotiations that I'm<br>working on a present that I'll refer to<br>shortly the trade in services agreement<br>everything's getting leaked - all of the<br>time that means that we have - lots of<br>jobs to do<br>well sorry not actually one of them is<br>that we have to analyze what is in the<br>actual text and it's a quite technical<br>realm that we work in and especially and<br>I work in the non trendy area of<br>services and e-commerce and so on which<br>there's much less written about than in<br>the old areas of<br>and agriculture and even intellectual<br>property so part of our job is to<br>analyze the text part of our job is also<br>then to translate that to constituencies<br>who need to understand what's being<br>negotiated but don't otherwise have<br>access to the information but also our<br>role as academic is then to question the<br>broader objectives and put them in a<br>context so people can decide whether in<br>fact this pathway is the one that we<br>want to follow we all have different<br>ways of doing that and different lenses<br>through which we view these texts my own<br>is part of the reason why this agreement<br>and several of the other mega agreements<br>is so interesting to me for most of you<br>were born<br>New Zealand had a major transformation<br>in the 1980s sometimes the time called<br>row genomics in called neoliberalism and<br>so on but it changed the regulatory<br>framework at the same time as changing<br>the economic framework of the country<br>and that was shared in many other parts<br>of the world that we had it happening<br>satuay had it happening in Chile with<br>Pinochet we had it happening with Reagan<br>in the US so on and just as domestically<br>here the laws and the regulatory<br>frameworks shifted to accommodate the<br>new kind of economic model that we had<br>so internationally the rules started<br>being rewritten in ways that related to<br>the new mode of capitalism that had<br>taken over from the Keynesian style that<br>we had based on in<br>austrial policy inside countries and so<br>on so the transnational ization of<br>capital followed later by increasing<br>financialization the way everyone got<br>rich buzzwire' by stock markets and<br>shares and property and so on new rules<br>were being developed that facilitated<br>that process and the agreements that we<br>started see emerge starting with the<br>Uruguay Round negotiations that ended up<br>with the World Trade Organization move<br>from the old-fashioned commodities to a<br>whole lot of new policy and regulatory<br>areas including intellectual property<br>services and so we started to see an<br>important shift occurring that<br>complemented what was happening in the<br>domestic arena and that's when I started<br>working on these agreements what<br>interested me about them was not I find<br>slabs of butter and motor cars and<br>old-fashioned trade stuff quite boring<br>the more interesting stuff is what is<br>now referred to as the behind the<br>broader disciplines on government's<br>policy and regulation not tariffs at the<br>border but the kind of regulatory<br>frameworks that governments were signing<br>up to that would be binding and<br>enforceable outside the country and so<br>during the Uruguay Round of the get we<br>had those emerge and particular the<br>trade and services agreement then<br>attempts to expand that further during<br>the Doha round of the WTO which got<br>stalled then looking to do it further<br>and further through free trade<br>agreements that were bilateral free<br>trade agreements and then trying to<br>bring them together and push the<br>boundaries further again through what we<br>refer to as the mega regional agreements<br>and there is a consistency and an<br>accumulation through those processes but<br>just as we see the economic model that<br>emerged from the 1970s facing problems<br>global financial crisis being a classic<br>example of that instabilities and<br>implosions around deeply integrated<br>financial markets but also the ways that<br>the trans nationalization of the economy<br>has created winners and losers big<br>winners quite a lot of losers not just<br>in the industrial belt but for those who<br>read piketty's materials and and other<br>kinds of treatises or even listen to the<br>speeches now from the head of the IMF or<br>more recently even the the WTO a<br>recognition that we have a mode of<br>capitalism that is not inclusive and so<br>it's not surprising that we see the<br>rules that developed around that<br>economic model also running into strife<br>and running into more and more strife<br>the more they're being pushed further<br>and further in the direction that<br>compounds the problems that we see and<br>so for those of us who followed the<br>trans-pacific partnership agreement<br>negotiations most of the controversy<br>most of the issues around that was not<br>actually about the old fashioned<br>what we heard most about in this country<br>was dairy but there he actually wasn't<br>it was it was one small part of this<br>huge chapter agreement the real<br>controversies were the intellectual<br>property chapter and the extension of<br>copyright and the digital locks on staff<br>you buy from offshore and then you put<br>it in your DVD player and you can't<br>actually read it because it says you can<br>only read it in another part of the<br>world or of course the pharmaceuticals<br>and so you had whole communities saying<br>what's the trade agreement doing telling<br>us how we run it run out our libraries<br>how we run our pharmaceutical schemes<br>likewise on the investment chapter of<br>course the big issue here in other<br>places was tobacco how can you have<br>companies like Philip Morris suing the<br>government over introducing plain<br>packaging tobacco under the investment<br>chapters of these agreements where did<br>they get those rights from or other<br>parts of the agreement for those of us<br>who are working on financial regulation<br>why were they deepening the problems<br>that brought us the financial crisis why<br>are they disarming government abilities<br>to reregulate the financing and so there<br>were a whole lot of very serious<br>questions about the contradictions that<br>were being perpetuated in the agreement<br>and this is one of the reasons why it<br>took six years to negotiate because<br>what we then saw was a real problem<br>being able to sell the agreement<br>internationally now here we get told it<br>was all about tough well it wasn't about<br>trumped the reason why it ended up being<br>in Trump's domain was that President<br>Obama couldn't get it through the US<br>Congress you needed to rely on<br>Republicans and the Republicans weren't<br>going to support us and the Democrats<br>weren't going to have a bar of it and so<br>it possibly may never have happened<br>even without Trump but not just here you<br>heard a whole lot of other countries<br>Australia's Senate which the Liberal<br>government doesn't control they didn't<br>want to support it in Vietnam the<br>Vietnamese government decided that they<br>weren't that certain about it and didn't<br>put it up for a vote until they team<br>what was going to happen with Obama and<br>you had a whole variety of problems<br>across these countries and it was about<br>the domestic issues that the agreement<br>rate<br>so not only was it not just about come<br>it wasn't just about old-fashioned trade<br>it was about particular models and if<br>you look at problems elsewhere you see<br>that it's not just about the<br>trans-pacific partnership agreement or<br>the TTIP the eu-us one that's also<br>fallen over BRICS it was all of its<br>weirdness the same as the u.s. elections<br>with about people feeling alienated from<br>being able to control the rules that<br>will govern their life by a Politburo<br>called the European Commission in<br>Russell you had the issues in Greece you<br>had in the work I am doing at present a<br>number of countries withdrawing from<br>bilateral investment treaties and<br>developing their own alternatives South<br>Africa because it had a case challenging<br>post apartheid<br>redistributions Brazil developing a<br>quite different model India because it's<br>facing amongst other things challenges<br>to termination of telecoms licenses that<br>were corruptly issued and so we're<br>seeing a whole lot of these eruptions in<br>different places and we need to get away<br>from simply seeing this as being an<br>issue about Trump and the TPP to see<br>that it's actually a contest over the<br>rules and the paradigms that are going<br>to govern international economic law and<br>domestic regimes in the future now I<br>just want to make a couple of other<br>points keeping an eye on the clock one<br>is that there is a sense of what in the<br>old days we used to call Tina there is<br>no alternative that this is a one-way<br>track that just you you can't have<br>anything different it's unthinkable<br>have anything different well actually<br>historically there are paradigm shifts<br>that always occur that seem to be about<br>three or four decades long and then you<br>have a kind of implosion of the<br>contradictions of that model and a new<br>model is born out of it we had that<br>after the less a fair era in the 1910s<br>20s and the depression in the thirties<br>that gave birth to a whole new economic<br>regime and set of economic rules that<br>became the gap that balanced the<br>national and the international we had it<br>in the 1970s with again a shift in the<br>economic model as well as a shift in the<br>rules through the birth of the WTO we're<br>now seeing what Karl Polanyi called<br>the beginnings of another great<br>transformation or what Antonio Graham<br>she called the interregnum the olders<br>dying the new is yet to be born we don't<br>know what it's going to look like but<br>there are lots of morbid symptoms around<br>and those who want desperately to hold<br>on to what is there now are trying to<br>turn back that tide so when we saw<br>recently the moves in Hanoi by our<br>Minister of Trade to say the<br>trans-pacific partnership agreement can<br>be rescued and we don't need to make any<br>changes to it and everyone's agreed that<br>we can do it by the end of the year well<br>hopefully you'll read in the here order<br>column in a few days that explains why<br>that's not the case not only are we<br>implementing the agreement without the<br>u.s. actually having to do anything in<br>return so why on earth would the u.s.<br>want to return to the fold when its<br>corporations are already getting what<br>they want without any price and if they<br>did return to the fold they would have a<br>long list of additional things that they<br>want us to give<br>but also the other countries themselves<br>are saying this needs to be renegotiated<br>the deal was done with the US US isn't<br>there any more<br>we made concessions we're not going to<br>keep those concessions if we're not<br>getting the trade-offs and as Bill<br>English acknowledged the other day you<br>reopen the text the TPP went ham why<br>then are they so desperate to rescue it<br>this is my closing couple of points the<br>first is short-term domestic political<br>expediency rather than saying oh we've<br>invested so much for the last X number<br>of years in this and it's come to<br>nothing we are now having the spin to<br>say it will all be right and then that<br>the opposition parties who I gained<br>saying that our anti trade and anti<br>corporate so part of it is that we have<br>an election in several months time and<br>it's the short-term play knowing that<br>the outcome will actually be several<br>years beyond here if ever but the second<br>reason is that they can see a model in<br>which they have invested for three<br>decades falling over the trade in<br>services agreement negotiations that I<br>work on in Geneva are now suspended and<br>may never resume the eu-us one no one<br>knows what's happening the Canada EU one<br>has just been a decision of the European<br>Court of Justice that says that every<br>member states in the EU will get a<br>chance to vote on it because of the<br>investment rules these mega agreements<br>are deeply problematic even the one with<br>China that is supposed to be the<br>alternative is going very very slowly<br>sweatiest a flick the switch<br>and it's not going to look anything like<br>the gold standard that they claim the<br>tip appears and so ironically the<br>trans-pacific partnership agreement the<br>zombie TPP is actually the best shot<br>they've got to resurrect these rules the<br>same chapters we're seeing across all of<br>those agreements especially the new ones<br>on electronic commerce on state-owned<br>enterprises on data localization so on<br>even now trying to put it back into the<br>WTO with huge resistance so we're seeing<br>this quite desperate attempt to keep<br>what they call the bicycle moving<br>forward but my sense is that the bicycle<br>not only has two very flat tires but<br>it's hitting over a little clip our<br>challenge is to work out what's the next<br>lot of rules that rebalance in ways that<br>are constructive for the international<br>arena but also reconstructive for some<br>of the harm that's been done in the last<br>you'll never want a shorter coming back<br>to the University of Auckland and now my<br>fourth trip to New Zealand it's coming<br>back to an institution that teaches the<br>teachers so I'm a teacher but this<br>institution and two individuals in<br>particular added have taught me<br>professor Scott Otakon as you may know<br>was my tutor and teaching assistant in<br>law school and he taught me a lot about<br>legal writing including writing briefs<br>and those of you in the international<br>trade law class that we just concluded<br>an hour ago know about a lot of graphs<br>and charts and professor Otakon was the<br>first one who told me that I couldn't<br>put a graph in a brief and so I became a<br>trade lawyer not a litigator like him<br>and you also read in the trade class the<br>chapters on gas in volume one of the<br>textbook those chapters are directly<br>from the lecture notes from Professor J<br>and Kelsey that I took in 2003 she<br>taught me a lot about trade and services<br>and she's acknowledged in that book very<br>graciously and furthermore she has<br>taught me a lot about how to look at<br>trade issues from a different<br>perspective when she mentioned Raj<br>anomic sand Reaganomics and Thatcher the<br>Thatcher revolutions that's the economic<br>paradigm in which I was educated so when<br>I first started looking at trade rules<br>that's the lens through which I looked<br>at and you'll notice last Wednesday in<br>class we started with that ricardo smith<br>paradigm and went through very carefully<br>the analysis of the<br>Manami economic comparative advantage<br>and absolute advantage but you'll notice<br>it didn't stop there<br>we then critique the Ricardo Smith model<br>went through its twenty controversial<br>assumptions and then went to Marxist<br>Leninist theory in dependency theory all<br>of that is thanks to a broader<br>perspective that I was exposed to with<br>Professor Calvin Kelsey so this is very<br>much a place that teaches the teachers<br>and one of the ways I can try and give<br>back aside from saying a few words about<br>TPP is as I promised to the class that's<br>you MIT a lot in there that I had a gift<br>for you so after class you get to come<br>and pick up your free copy that the<br>publisher arranged of this book we have<br>just enough copies they won't stack them<br>all up now and you will see if you look<br>in this book at the index at page 452<br>you go down to K you see oh wow<br>Kelsey Jade pages 35 and 266 and Jane<br>Kelsey is her scholarship is indeed<br>mentioned at those pages and you'll see<br>it talks about some issues she's already<br>touched on and that is first on trade<br>and labor rights issues in TPP and<br>you'll you'll see that she cited at 35<br>as the renowned scholar professor Jane<br>Kelsey of the University of Auckland and<br>at page 266 you'll see her work<br>concerning state-owned enterprises and<br>privatization is cited and quoted and he<br>or she's mentioned again very favorably<br>as a prominent critic of TPP and it was<br>just a delight to write putting those<br>little adjectives on to say thanks so<br>don't leave without taking your copy and<br>I suggest getting her autograph on it<br>okay alright so that's a little bit of<br>introduction and thanks to both of you<br>now let me say a little bit about TPP<br>and please accept my apologies for doing<br>a little bit of reading and having to<br>check back hopefully that will<br>facilitate a discussion later comprised<br>of 240 lines<br>act 4 scene 3 of Macbeth is the longest<br>scene of that Shakespearean tragedy the<br>stage is static because the discussion<br>is about what the past teaches the<br>characters for their future conduct what<br>actions should they take given what has<br>happened thus far Macduff has fled from<br>Scotland to England where he meets<br>Malcolm the son of the victim of<br>regicide Duncan the past is colored<br>black by Macbeth murderous tyranny not<br>only did Macbeth have Duncan murdered<br>but also flam's the son of Banquo plus<br>all of Macduff family does this past<br>mean that Macduff should grieve<br>indefinitely and be passive or as<br>malcolm successfully argues does the<br>past mean that grief should be turned to<br>revenge TPP is the longest FTA in human<br>history consisting of a core text of 30<br>chapters plus 63 annexes 61 side letters<br>TPP spans 6,000 pages it's far easier<br>and more pleasing to redact 14-3 of<br>Macbeth or even all of Shakespeare's<br>longest play Hamlet then to read just<br>the court<br>of TPP and that's true of course for<br>Shakespeare's poetry Shakespeare wrote<br>154 sonnets and the core text in<br>contrast to just 154 sonnets the cortex<br>the TPP is about 800 pages no stylistic<br>elegance no trade rule restricted to 14<br>lines with the rhyme scheme no quatrains<br>no final couplet in iambic pentameter<br>and unlike the sonnets and you don't get<br>themes usually of love beauty or even<br>truth that's not usually a concern in<br>some of these provisions in TPP now the<br>stylistic contrast between Macbeth and<br>TPP is true even if you have a different<br>subjective disposition to trade English<br>contemporary trade English since GAD has<br>some really odd words and acronyms<br>contrary to the popular belief<br>Shakespeare invented about 1700 words in<br>English and all of the words almost all<br>90 95 percent are still used in the<br>English language and even still used in<br>the form today open any page of TPP and<br>you are going to be confronted with an<br>acronym you never heard of a term that<br>you'd ever saw before and you'll say<br>let's pick up Shakespeare now<br>linguistics aside in terms of the<br>difference and the length there is a<br>crucial substantive similarity the<br>debate about what the terms of TPP are<br>or are not or what TPP should or should<br>not contain or whether TPP should or<br>should not be approved<br>that's a debate about the meaning of the<br>past for the future just like act 4<br>scene 3 of the bet<br>what does NAFTA what do the post NAFTA<br>FTAs what did the Uruguay Round<br>Agreements teach families around the<br>world about trade liberalisation that's<br>being asked from Kansas City to KL from<br>Bombay the board L from Brielle to<br>Riyadh and the dominant voice when<br>families and friends and individuals all<br>sit down get together and talk at their<br>kitchen tables or in the bars or<br>wherever they speak the dominant voice<br>in most of this discourse is that akin<br>to Malcolm people turn your grief over<br>the adjustment costs from prior trade<br>liberalisation into revenge<br>fight TPP oppose free trade now this<br>book does not take that extreme of you<br>but nor does it aggressively champion<br>TPP neither does it take the view that<br>all the past almonds from past trade<br>deals are bad and and develop an<br>opposition to trade liberalisation<br>Macbeth made those mistakes when he drew<br>the wrong inferences from the three<br>witches and you get the worst outcome in<br>a tragedy everybody dies on the other<br>hand it doesn't take the view that TPP<br>is black is perfect far from it it's a<br>remarkable FTA all of its provisions<br>were secret and we had a little chat in<br>class about WikiLeaks and it was<br>finalized on the 5th of October 2015 the<br>text was not published until the 5th of<br>November 2015 and final the text<br>actually was cleaned up and published in<br>a February of<br>20:16 even with the passage since then<br>that's a lot to absorb 6,000 pages now<br>people need some sort of sense of what<br>do you think about the deal and we're<br>all familiar in law schools with grades<br>so here's the thesis TPP merits a<br>preliminary grade of a B and the B is an<br>evenly weighted average of a C on<br>5050 and the importance of the latter<br>grade should not be underestimated<br>the connection between trade and<br>national security has not been given<br>enough attention especially in most<br>surprising maybe in the u.s. Academy and<br>here too there's an analogy with<br>Shakespeare the acts and seams in<br>Macbeth take place in Scotland<br>except for act 4 scene 3 that's in<br>England and on either side of the border<br>Scottish and English at a macro level<br>the play is about more than just the<br>future well-being<br>economically of Scotland it's the<br>security of a Scottish realm at stake<br>and whether there should be foreign<br>intervention from England to advance<br>that security so much of the drama<br>that's surrounding TPP that occurs in<br>America is also occurring in the other<br>eleven parties but not all and much of<br>the drama includes economics and<br>national security both now I'll say a<br>few words about why the C on economics<br>and the a on national security<br>the seon economics comes from a number<br>of provisions in TPP some of which<br>professor Kelsey already referred to but<br>let's start with one of the perhaps most<br>obvious ones and that is is this really<br>about free trade is this deal really<br>about liberalizing trade immediately and<br>unconditionally and those of you know<br>from our class we use the acronym DF qf<br>e is another one of those things that<br>sound more like a rhyme scheme and<br>Shakespeare but it's actually a traitor<br>duty-free quota free immediately upon<br>entry into force as we heard over and<br>over again from American officials in<br>the previous administration TPP will<br>reduce immediately well this immediate<br>reduce trade barriers cut tariffs in<br>particular on 18,000 products is that<br>really true well yes and no if you<br>actually look at the tariff schedules<br>that are attached to TPP you will see<br>that only about 83% eighty two point<br>eight five to be exact of the itemized<br>lines tariff lines get D fq f CI F<br>treatment all of the rest are put in a<br>staging category so for example New<br>Zealand has three staging categories<br>covering 359 products Japan 59 staging<br>categories with twelve hundred and three<br>products Vietnam thirty-five staging<br>categories with three thousand one<br>hundred and six products and the staging<br>categories vary in length of time from<br>as short as two to five years to as long<br>as 20 years ballpark twenty years that<br>means we don't get full implementation<br>of D F Q F for a good 20 years<br>on all hundred-percent of the tariff<br>lines and the other trick about staging<br>categories is are the phase-outs<br>front-end loaded back-end loaded or<br>equally weighted is a tariff of say a<br>hundred percent coming down across 20<br>years in equal lots of five percentage<br>points a year or are you doing<br>ten now and ninety and year nineteen or<br>vice versa well as you can imagine we<br>look at the staging categories we see<br>plenty of back-end loading that is<br>keeping that left as a liberalisation to<br>later so to call this a free trade<br>agreement is a misnomer it is a deal<br>about managed trade even in the most<br>conventional sectors the agricultural<br>industrial product sectors it's about<br>managed trade and one of the problems<br>which again American politicians fell<br>into the same trap as they did with<br>NAFTA is they over sold the deal to the<br>public they sold the public on the idea<br>that this was about free trade cutting<br>these 18,000 tariffs overnight and will<br>experience all the ricardo smith's gains<br>from trade and that's not the reality of<br>the deal and i might say when they came<br>to Kansas City the US Trade<br>Representative in particular when they<br>came to Kansas City to try and sell the<br>deal that was a moderate of the panel<br>they came with two deficiencies let me<br>put it politely one was they really<br>didn't know their audience they came<br>from inside the beltway read their press<br>release bullet points on cutting 18,000<br>tariffs and had no clue what the actual<br>interests were at stake on the Missouri<br>or the Kansas City side of the border<br>whether they even knew about State Line<br>Road dividing the border was unclear<br>and they also came unable Hill prepared<br>to sell the deal with effective points I<br>had to give him points<br>salad ooh I said for example did you<br>realize that Vietnam is in this deal and<br>that Vietnam is a country with which<br>with which we once fought a horrific war<br>and many of them in this audience are<br>Vietnam veterans and some of the<br>brutalities were just as brutal as were<br>seen with Isis in Syria and now there's<br>a 90 million strong market of young<br>people and guess what<br>something we make in the Kansas City<br>area motorcycles take a look at roads<br>around Hanoi forty forty five percent of<br>them are not paved or poorly paved and<br>very bumpy they certainly cannot<br>accommodate cars made and certainly not<br>made in the US what a vietnamese young<br>middle-class rising middle class people<br>one motorcycles what is TPP do bring<br>down the tariffs on motorcycles what a<br>nice story this is the country we used<br>to bomb mercilessly we used to have powa<br>mi issues with and now we could export<br>motorcycles they didn't even know to<br>sell the deal properly like that right<br>so they either over sell it<br>eighteen thousand tariff cuts or they<br>under sell it by not telling the key<br>stories and localities small wonder why<br>some of the major issues or some of the<br>what ought to maybe perhaps not be such<br>major issues depending on your view<br>actually envelop and sink the deal in<br>congress some of them professor kelsey<br>mentioned already data exclusivity<br>extending from 20 years to 37 years<br>patent protection on biologics<br>whether there's a case to be made or not<br>I'm not sure I'm not the IP expert but<br>that case was it was made in the pans of<br>senator Orrin Hatch saying absolutely<br>not if it's not 12 years it's not good<br>enough for the US and the deal in TPP is<br>five years plus three years of market<br>conditions you'll see through the<br>details and those kinds of special<br>interest exceptions actually worked well<br>to torpedo the deal in Congress rather<br>than getting a sense of the broader good<br>the broader mosaic of how this thing<br>might actually benefit the US economy<br>and the Kansas City Star published a<br>story with data from credible sources on<br>where do campaign contributions go to<br>individual Congress persons number two<br>on the list and I'm not trying to be at<br>hominem it's just fact<br>senator hatch so the positions of many<br>of the Congress people are absolutely I<br>can't save link that'd be false<br>accusation but absolutely somehow<br>connected associated I don't know what<br>the right word is you have to look at<br>the who's funding them right again<br>without making any accusation about<br>what's dictating positions and we saw<br>this pattern in a number of cases and<br>and with the waning of the Obama<br>administration and the rising rhetoric<br>that started with the presidential<br>debates in December January December 15<br>January 2016 it was pretty clear TPP was<br>not going to get through Congress and<br>that's a bit on the economics what might<br>have been at least a halfway decent<br>argument for common good and seeing how<br>it special interests really sunk the<br>deal from the u.s. perspective that's<br>enough easily along with manage trade to<br>give it a see now many critics and I<br>would definitely accept the criticism<br>why did you give this<br>you went out and ass why not it D it<br>could be even lower on economics and<br>that's a fair enough<br>critique of the book what about national<br>security why in a maya name we just<br>discussed in class um earlier on today<br>and a little bit yesterday the trade<br>national security Nexus TPP from the<br>American national security perspective<br>is about containing China containing the<br>Communist Party's rise across the<br>asia-pacific region<br>um contain containing China as run by<br>the Communist Party and what do I mean<br>by that well geographically everybody<br>should be familiar with the nine dashed<br>line the nine dash line are claims that<br>the Communist Party has - about 90<br>percent of the South China Sea through<br>which 50 percent of world trade passes<br>some of those claims are have already<br>been put paid by the permanent Court of<br>Arbitration in July of 2016 when it<br>ruled entirely in favor of the<br>Philippines and if you look at some of<br>the literature under the United Nations<br>Convention on law of the sea some of the<br>claims truly are can are are<br>questionable like creating an island<br>that wouldn't normally be there and<br>could not normally be inhabited and then<br>claiming it as a basis to have territory<br>and a zone around it that's not<br>permitted under the law of the sea it's<br>not just the u.s. that's its interests<br>are at stake here's all the other<br>claimants to freedom of navigation and<br>sovereignty so the idea of across the<br>South China Sea<br>so TPP was stitched together with<br>Vietnam Malaysia Philippines Brunei<br>several of the countries Japan that have<br>interests in the island disputes<br>initially the Obama administration<br>didn't want to use the word containment<br>it is a provocative term it does date<br>back from the Cole<br>Warr and least of all me wants to bring<br>back memories of the Cold War or be<br>provocative with respect to China or the<br>party the best is a strategic<br>partnership not not a conflict obviously<br>so I don't mean to be provocative about<br>that but they're an in fact TPP was<br>specifically drafted by the American<br>team to exclude China from the<br>negotiation so that the US and its<br>eleven partners could write the rules<br>like on state-owned enterprises and then<br>invite China in not exclude China later<br>on if China wanted to come in so it was<br>never designed to forever exclude China<br>but it was designed to create a<br>rules-based system in asia-pacific see<br>how things go over the nine - line and<br>maybe China might come in it's not a<br>surprise then that for American<br>secretaries of State and eight<br>secretaries of defense or make up that a<br>might've converted that four secretaries<br>of defense and eight secretaries of<br>state endorse TPP one of them even said<br>TPP is worth an aircraft carrier to me<br>now we have ten aircraft carriers in our<br>fleet one is coming on board that's<br>pretty significant so when we look at<br>TPP we want to look at it not only as an<br>economic creature and not only from the<br>perspectives of free trade manage trade<br>and all of the points that Professor<br>Kelsey correctly mentioned about sex on<br>local people whether it's not whether<br>it's the right model of liberalisation<br>why is it going into issues like data<br>exclusivity why are we leaving that up<br>to the countries but we also need to see<br>it as a national security device now as<br>you know famously<br>the current president withdrew from TVP<br>that decision by the president has been<br>reiterated as final by the US Trade<br>Representative Robert light Heiser and<br>in it by other officials and other<br>vendors so if they stick to their word<br>what they will do is renegotiate NAFTA<br>with Canada and Mexico maybe try a<br>bilateral deal with Japan continue<br>perhaps the other FTAs that we have<br>bilaterally with TPP partners like Korea<br>Singapore and then who knows what the US<br>trade policy will be with respect to New<br>Zealand my own view for what it's worth<br>that is a waste of time and a waste of<br>taxpayer money and a waste of resources<br>to have the US Trade Representative<br>renegotiating NAFTA rethinking the<br>bilaterals hey we just spent eight years<br>doing that<br>it's called TPP if you want if you have<br>a problem with TPP or our partners in<br>New Zealand have a problem TVP let's<br>look at it together the 12 of us that<br>doesn't seem to be where things are<br>headed and you know as the title of the<br>talk says we'll have to just wait and<br>see about what the future holds don't<br>forget your book before this is over not<br>absolutely sentimental grandpa well<br>thanks to that that was absolutely two<br>fascinating perspectives on this and<br>absolutely right on topic so this is<br>just to be clear this is also this this<br>dialogue also serves at the last hour<br>and a half of Rajas class on<br>international right on International<br>trade Locke is not only was Raj the lrf<br>distinguishes inning fell out but he was<br>also teaching in class for us in the<br>master's program an international trade<br>law the second time that he's taught<br>here the first time was with Jane<br>so that's terrific and I'm sure that<br>raises a lot of issues we've got about a<br>half an hour which is a long time so I'd<br>invite anybody in the audience James<br>former students Raja students or anyone<br>else who's here to ask any questions and<br>we'll get some dialogue going which is a<br>point of this talk so who would like to<br>make a comment or ask a question to get<br>hmm okay you rascal change I might<br>repeat it just for the just for the<br>audience yeah and when you sigmay the<br>national security I thought maybe you<br>mean sovereignty which is probably you<br>know being the piece of lightning rod<br>here around the impact of TPA like<br>agreements on the personal attention to<br>regulate or religious so you have was<br>that part of your sort of a assessment<br>on national security the issue of you<br>know the incredible education and if not<br>it was part of the committee nama<br>Cavalli's not a noun security very great<br>question on the onion the look drive<br>unifying a criteria for assessing on an<br>economic sense in the National Security<br>Center why to give us see versus in a<br>and the problem that you've identified<br>is what the book talks about in the<br>sense of this deal reinforces<br>plutocratic only karbala got ballistic<br>interests to be it goes through from<br>ancient Greece what the definition of<br>plutocracy and then from economics what<br>are all agha believes and then what are<br>some of the specific provisions in TPP<br>where you see photography's and the<br>rules that they favor reinforce the<br>oligopoly because they control where do<br>you see some of those rules in TV v the<br>national security dimension was was more<br>traditionally military interests that is<br>the issues of sovereignty in the sense<br>of the islands and freedom of navigation<br>and underlying those inter<br>of value systems between the parties<br>involved with what the value becomes<br>party is proposing across its people and<br>agent what the values traditionally the<br>u.s. New Zealand Australia some of the<br>other countries have shared so the<br>answer is yes but in the other realm on<br>now that the problem with that answer is<br>it kind of does stretch the definition<br>of economic evaluation you could say<br>well how come you're including you<br>saying democracy's part of the economic<br>calculation that would be the<br>traditional neoclassical approach the<br>Chicago School approach but in a more<br>broad-minded and liberal sensitivity<br>federal second place values to exploit<br>the value of that control so I've been I<br>occasionally speechless any reference of<br>values really does come with them their<br>conviction of national security so okay<br>so maybe let's beg the values I'm<br>thinking about or I what what is the<br>party stand for in terms of individual<br>rights and freedoms that the US military<br>is traditionally safeguarded after the<br>Second World War throughout the<br>asia-pacific<br>makam Vietnam like in Vietnam<br>I think that a different we have a<br>different framework of looking at some<br>of it and some of what I've been doing<br>recently on on the media field is this<br>video of politics argument which is the<br>the kind of national security<br>whose rules are going to govern the<br>world there is a strategic set of<br>arguments which are different countries<br>have different reasons for doing what<br>they're doing and then there is a<br>political economy argument and I think<br>where we have a difference for me that<br>political economy issues are what then<br>raises the questions of where is power<br>held in an economic and a social and<br>political sense which is where I see the<br>instability happening so I think we we<br>have a different approach to that and it<br>was in it when I was in China last week<br>it was when the one belt one road summit<br>was on and the discussions were really<br>interesting because on the one hand<br>we're familiar with the TPPA and<br>Tisserand<br>and and TTIP arguments which are because<br>of course China was excluded from from<br>volunteer as well who's going to make<br>the rules in in terms of what interests<br>and the Chinese we're describing that as<br>the old Britain woods model and whereas<br>the one belt one Road initiative was<br>depicted as being pro development Pro if<br>it is not the not the elite of the<br>corporate beneficiaries but the one belt<br>one Road actually looking at how you<br>integrate for the benefit of developing<br>countries through this different model<br>right and and so you've got this set of<br>rules and strategies that are attached<br>to these quite different approaches and<br>my concern going that political economy<br>is that the one belt one Road initiative<br>is based also on a highly digitized<br>economy which is the same as we're<br>seeing now through the e-commerce parts<br>of TPP and Tessa and the WTO proposals<br>both of which are premised on the notion<br>of constant disruption creative<br>destruction instabilities constantly<br>making and both of the models seem to me<br>to carry that problem with instability<br>in security automation leading to job<br>losses and so on and so there's a<br>political economy problem with both of<br>the models<br>you've got the geopolitical layer you've<br>got the strategic interest fear but<br>there's actually a fundamental shares<br>problem with the China approach and the<br>u.s. approach yeah I would agree and<br>just to pick up on that a little bit um<br>the Chinese are selling one belt one<br>road as pro development but a different<br>way of looking at is you may be<br>suggesting is this is about taking care<br>of bloated state owned enterprises<br>controlled by Communist Party oligarchs<br>in China in steel or aluminum you name<br>it<br>because who's steel aluminum etcetera is<br>going to be used on the one belt one<br>road and it's easy to be exploitative<br>because where else Pakistan in the term<br>right so there's this is you have to<br>look through the labels and ask who's<br>really benefiting from the deal<br>and if I can just add another given that<br>we're doing a dialogue to other element<br>to that one is that it's not just the<br>SOE Xin China it's Jack Marin Alibaba<br>who are the equivalent of GABA Google<br>Amazon Facebook and Apple and both of<br>them by looking at controlling the<br>digital platforms which others will be<br>supplicants to and so you've got that<br>and heavily financialized in the in the<br>China side of things as well and the<br>second is that we're now seeing<br>internationally China pushing bilateral<br>investment treaties and investment<br>tractors in FTAs that are exactly the<br>TPPA model and they're trying to push it<br>in the WTO now for the winner Friday's<br>ministerial in December in the name of<br>trade facilitation and investment yes<br>and so China is trying to use exactly<br>the same legal tools to protect its<br>offshore investments against the kinds<br>of backlashes<br>that the UFC Japan and others have also<br>used before<br>could I ask a question now this is not<br>my area of law but two things just<br>struck me one of the security issue one<br>of the interest specialist position<br>sumerian vlog which is criminal law when<br>people choose juries and that offends me<br>nobody thinks that the prosecution<br>defense wants to choose a fair jury I<br>want to choose a jury that's favorable<br>to them the idea is that in the contest<br>of strikes and peremptories and<br>challenges are caused something of<br>proximately you know sort of the<br>approximate equivalence of their jury<br>kind of comes out so when I entertain<br>you talk I think it strikes me that it<br>never occurred to me that trade<br>agreements for any we're really all<br>about the common good<br>it strikes out the basic notion of any<br>agreement any sort of contractors in<br>parties try offering their own interests<br>and so surprised to me that the<br>countries want argue their interests and<br>fight further interest and if those<br>interests are the interests of their<br>corporate donors or the interests of<br>their livery unions or the interests of<br>whatever they see it you know they will<br>do that now there's an issue of courses<br>can get into capture an interest market<br>right I mean whose voice is allowed but<br>the idea that countries are negotiating<br>you know for themselves doesn't strike<br>me as and so unusual that maybe it's the<br>difference between that sort of a trade<br>agreement that they've by notions of<br>common good or a trade agreement is<br>based on individual notions of<br>particular goods from with some rough<br>approximation that we can all live with<br>comes out so I guess I'm wondering it<br>sounds like you're both critiquing that<br>and one way or another but why is it<br>actually surprising how could it be any<br>well I mean trade agreements need not be<br>about the common good and as you<br>correctly suggest it's not surprising<br>when countries approach it from a<br>completely self-interested perspective<br>and try and extract the maximum amount<br>of concessions from the other side and<br>give the minimum amount reciprocally<br>that traditionally trade negotiations<br>are conducted on the basis of<br>reciprocity but it's long been<br>understood in the GATT since 1947 that<br>at the end when we all sit down and we<br>look at a text we agree on it as part of<br>what's called a single undertaking that<br>we're all going to move forward with no<br>country objected because we all believe<br>there's enough in it for us<br>that it's worth moving forward and we<br>also benefit from being in the system we<br>benefit from mutually from the from the<br>rising prosperity and hopefully poverty<br>alleviation that the deal is bringing it<br>back now that hasn't always happened<br>certainly not the poverty alleviation as<br>we know across the last 20 or 30 years<br>but there has been a sense of world<br>collectively and together and in fact<br>when we come to the area of dispute<br>settlement out before your comment about<br>jury trials the reason that in most<br>cases not all that we get compliance<br>with WTO of juda Kotori outcomes by the<br>losing parties because they know their<br>repeat players in the system doesn't<br>always work but generally they say well<br>I lost this time all right<br>I'll comply it may take time you know<br>maybe I'll drag my feet but I'll comply<br>because next time I'm going to be on the<br>other side so I there's been this<br>underlying common good enemy now it's<br>not called that that actually comes the<br>term common good comes from a principle<br>of social justice theory and I think<br>that one of the problems which I in that<br>terminology which I think<br>professor help you absolutely rightly<br>mentioned starting off was we've lost<br>this shared sense the public that looks<br>at the trade agreements and the official<br>to negotiate it and the legislators at<br>capacity of what's in it for all of us<br>and in fact I remember being told and we<br>probably all heard this repeatedly that<br>Congress people and Senators will not<br>sit down and read all six bastion pages<br>or even the 800 pages of cortex and they<br>may give a couple of staff members the<br>time to do that maybe but what they'll<br>do is what we call gorilla raid missions<br>into the text you look for just that<br>interest just that provision that you<br>care about based on your interest groups<br>in your constituency that you represent<br>or that fund you from out of state and<br>just to finish the point it's really<br>really important for everyone to<br>understand it and actually professor<br>offers a better expert at this the<br>effect on US politics including trade<br>politics of the Supreme Court decision<br>in Citizens United which allows for<br>unlimited campaign contributions to<br>political action committees pick your<br>pick your can lobbying group they can<br>fund candidates PA PACs to an unlimited<br>degree while hypothetically there's not<br>supposed to be any link between the back<br>and Canada I think we know what the<br>reality sometimes is and that is<br>worrisome because it can really make<br>getting a sense of the common good and<br>trade deals you know through Congress CC<br>is simpler you got someone hydraulic<br>Trump to say America first and that's<br>just an explicit rejection of the notion<br>of under any underlying basis of common<br>good in a free trade room and we can<br>more of a cynic yeah that matter yeah<br>Tony angry when he he was out here some<br>time ago did did the Masters trade<br>course as well and you know from his<br>perspective the asymmetry of rulemaking<br>in the international economic laudrinha<br>that is a form of legal imperialism of<br>who made the rules and then who built on<br>the premises and the underlying rules<br>that were developed through the colonial<br>and imperial era that then form the base<br>of the gas and how many countries are is<br>a gas originally yeah and then you know<br>and as part of the problem with the WTO<br>now is denver's all these developing<br>countries in there yo who aren't letting<br>us have the rules we want so we go up we<br>make our own rules in our own arena very<br>asymmetrical with us 58 based on a model<br>agreement<br>what's the room for negotiation you<br>negotiate around the edges and and so<br>yeah it's even when you've got a<br>criminal trial you've got a question of<br>how equal at the party but when you look<br>at the trans-pacific partnership<br>agreement even when Japan can it was the<br>u.s. plus limit yeah because there was<br>no negotiation around here someplace<br>and Japan really live tough on my butt<br>but yes they can how many say quick<br>product like that's what we're seeing<br>now and this is I think what it's the<br>most important rule making development<br>at present is the attempt to even if TPP<br>is dead to make it live through other<br>agreements so making it normative and<br>it's even it's been called organ<br>harvesting and in the tips that we've<br>got in the WTO now for the ministerial<br>in December yep it's the same tips in<br>asset yes with the in Japan and Korea<br>and Australia and New Zealand tabling<br>the TPP TTC but you've got China<br>you've got India and you've got at the<br>end that operates by consensus so there<br>you've got a bit of your courtroom<br>contest back in the WTO you've now got<br>the developing countries are not<br>themselves United and the BRICS are all<br>over the bloody place and so it's South<br>Africa<br>it's the Africa group of the LDC that<br>are the ones who are trying to resist<br>that expansion of the agenda as<br>normative rules in the WTO at the<br>ministerial and and so it is it's an<br>institutional power politics game about<br>whose rules will reflect not just the<br>individual corporate interests but as I<br>said sort of what's the model of<br>capitalism that operating that the rules<br>need to serve and I think we really are<br>having we having a contest between<br>China's version of the model of the and<br>the US version and one of it one of the<br>interesting illustrations of the<br>divergence sometimes of interest among<br>developing countries came up in the<br>context of the TPP negotiations on rules<br>of origin for autos and auto parts where<br>Mexico was taking one view along with<br>Canada and finally<br>along the u.s. whereas Japan wanted<br>rules of origin that protected its<br>supply chain for autos and auto parts<br>that ran through Vietnam a TPP party in<br>Thailand it's not a TPP party so<br>basically the the Vietnamese and the<br>Japanese wanted lower value of regional<br>value content on autos and auto parts to<br>qualify for origin whereas Canada and<br>the US and to some degree in Mexico<br>wanted higher NAFTA or even perhaps<br>higher rules of origin so you there was<br>a negotiation over that all-important<br>number which we studied in class would<br>be 20 percent 25 percent or sixty two<br>point five percent and one of the<br>interesting countries to watch and I<br>always tell this to officials in the<br>Gulf particularly in Saudi Arabia's<br>because professor house you mentioned<br>what model should we look at to look at<br>Mexico Mexico is a really interesting<br>country you see how their trade<br>positions have matured over the decades<br>as they have become more and more of a<br>developed or developed light country<br>even though they've been fighting this<br>horrific drug war and Mexico came out<br>with this proposal which ended up being<br>adopted in TPP which is look let's look<br>at the specific kinds of auto parts at<br>stake if it's a low value added auto<br>part like let's say a windshield water<br>we don't want to become we're not going<br>to become rich making windshield wipers<br>that can be done fine in Vietnam or<br>locks so that can be a 25% reduction but<br>on something far more sophisticated like<br>an engine system or maybe the audio<br>system that has Bluetooth or Wireless<br>that we want to<br>that we're going to stay can work our<br>development on so Mexico has been able<br>to see itself as it is and as it wants<br>to be and then take specific technical<br>trade policy provisions in the<br>negotiations that's kind of been a<br>pretty cool thing to watch since NAFTA<br>and and it's interesting because this is<br>not something that you'll hear from you<br>know the current crop of American<br>leadership about well how is this<br>benefited common good how is it<br>benefited our partner Mexico and if you<br>know much about US history that's<br>another country with which the US has<br>often been in war at grabs land from<br>mobs and had terrible prejudicial<br>relationship I I can't my second<br>question or someone else going on ten<br>minutes left<br>yeah bad cheese I'm sorry I will talk<br>about my horrible such money on a<br>missile system the more time is future<br>traces analysis if you want to be traced<br>income or discipline in order to<br>preserve their life or you create some<br>ultimatum to the time and lets us get<br>the answers will answer specifically<br>well one of the things that we're seeing<br>increasingly over recent agreements is<br>technical ways that remove future rights<br>to regulate well me whether it's<br>negative lists and investment and<br>services chapters or in financial<br>services never regulating new financial<br>services and products that you don't<br>know about yet and so in the work I've<br>just been doing analyzing all of the<br>dreadful teaser tips from last November<br>we are seeing really really strong<br>pressure there for government<br>to agree that whatever commitments they<br>make now will apply whatever new<br>technology exists in the future that you<br>never thought of so if you think about<br>drones and driverless trucks now and you<br>think of goodness me what like the next<br>generation of those be and we've given<br>away the right to to regulate them and<br>one of the big fights inside the EU on<br>on Tisa one of the reasons why it's<br>stalled late last year was that the<br>European Parliament has said that the<br>Commission cannot promise never to<br>regulate new services and it's a<br>fundamental question what lillah raised<br>about sovereignty or about you know the<br>ability of the right to regulate because<br>the right to regulate in the agreements<br>which is rhetorically mentioned time and<br>again is only the right to regulate to<br>the extent of the rules and the<br>agreement allows you to regulate and so<br>it's a meaningless piece of rhetoric<br>which trotted out as a piece of<br>reassurance turn any critics who don't<br>have the next bit of the app and<br>munition to go back and tape up actually<br>this is what it means so yes that's that<br>regulatory issue especially with the<br>trade in services agreement because<br>services is actually all about<br>regulation isn't it there's no pretense<br>that it's about motor vehicles or<br>garments or or whatever although<br>increasingly is there ID driven and so<br>on and it's a similar story in TPP with<br>the service of schedules they're<br>actually two sets of annexes that called<br>non-conforming measures and in one of<br>the annexes it's professor Kelsey<br>suggesting the trade negotiators if they<br>know what they're doing and they're<br>clever<br>and they really want to protect the<br>right to regulate they have to be that<br>specifically put the schedule the<br>service sector or sub sector or sub sub<br>sector in the right annex and then list<br>the right exceptions and to do that<br>requires all of you you lawyers<br>presenting different service industries<br>have to go to am fat or go to the USTR<br>and say you better preserve the right to<br>regulate in buried in that<br>non-conforming measure annex and if you<br>don't you lose it's sort of the squeaky<br>wheel gets the grease<br>one of the interesting things in the<br>Tisa new zealand schedule which I happen<br>to see is there they just tried to<br>correct some of the errors that we<br>pointed out in New Zealand typically<br>scheduled and and so even countries that<br>had been doing this for a long time and<br>consider themselves well advanced on on<br>services they make mistake let alone not<br>having the crystal ball yet firstly<br>another special reading change and the<br>red path or international regulation as<br>you betcha<br>what of the other inspection right an<br>artist who be the hit Martin plaster<br>it's quite cool to see that some talk<br>about the stuff we reach the cobra<br>having telling like Josiah for the book<br>view of Syracuse which a round pick you<br>know um I do get the like and I ask you<br>first able to work Scott said inherently<br>given the Koshien country the best we<br>are interest right which which means<br>that you're any top piracy promptly and<br>making sure that there's continuity and<br>j-dog serious attacks that can trickle<br>down you must start<br>well that's not happening now but I'm<br>trying to get to is what do you as<br>academics what do you think help you<br>make better be it by tweaking what you<br>have with the WTO and very mandatory<br>so people evil or or as perhaps of<br>James's and overboard more structural<br>change from the 34 years that you<br>usually see changes behind me but I what<br>do you do how you made the best system<br>so that you are actually helping<br>developing country countries or the ugly<br>scenes and like we spoke about today the<br>SCT treatments that eventually which is<br>mental health and but you guys for<br>whatever reason doesn't actually<br>fortunately because it's called<br>inclusive products or rather which which<br>is kind of site J take my ribbon extra<br>hi I'm sorry can you make it better what<br>can you do to make sure that Latin<br>economics we trade our you know text in<br>play but how you do it let's trust me<br>just great responses to this this was<br>pretty funny it has to come well I mean<br>some of us were not great fans of the<br>non trading parts of the WTO such as<br>intellectual property and against and so<br>on but there is improvements that could<br>be made here if there was a political<br>will but there is not the political will<br>to address some of the outstanding<br>issues the more interesting question<br>from my viewpoint now is especially with<br>these agreements that are falling over<br>that either either through your research<br>project which is options and strategies<br>to exit agreements and the three case<br>studies the investment agreements which<br>countries are interesting and developing<br>new models really interesting to talk to<br>the government's doing that which<br>include a number of the BRICS different<br>model capital controls because there is<br>now a recognition that capital controls<br>are legitimate policy tools and how do<br>we extract that and then the tobacco<br>issues and ongoing issues from there<br>about how do we remove from the domain<br>of so-called trade agreements the<br>regular three issues that are important<br>for Social Policy reasons and the<br>falling over of the mega deal leave some<br>space and so this is where probably<br>although I know Rose you've talked about<br>putting better things into the<br>agreements as well it gives time to do<br>that thinking but the thinking has to<br>happen because our government and some<br>others are hell-bent on trying to keep<br>the bicycle going forward yeah I agree I<br>think that um it's going to be very hard<br>in the u.s. um because we are maybe 20<br>or 30 years into this cycle<br>of an American model of capitalism and<br>it doesn't really stress the common good<br>and we're seeing the results with the<br>population in terms of its health care<br>and the social services and I think that<br>process is going to have to play out<br>we're until we get it a shift in<br>thinking about trade and common good in<br>the US which is I don't see that in the<br>next well it could in 2018 elections<br>we'll see but it's more of a cultural<br>shift and it's a ship that takes<br>leadership that we haven't seen you know<br>key I think a second change that needs<br>to happen is a lot more attention to<br>poverty alleviation and the link that<br>connects dots between trade growth and<br>per-capita GDP more equitable income<br>distribution and reduction in the<br>recruitment bases for al Qaeda and Isis<br>I think that case still isn't clear to<br>many in the American public that it's it<br>while some of the leaders in violent<br>extremist organizations videos might<br>come from wealthy backgrounds like Osama<br>bin Laden himself the foot soldiers are<br>large '''l eyes and they're often poor<br>and that can be whether they're from<br>Manchester or whether they're from Raqqa<br>and they're I'm still perhaps naive<br>enough to believe in that what we talked<br>about that Cordell Hull vision that if<br>you can generate growth through trade<br>and if it's<br>the benefits are properly spread and<br>district not ordered by a plutocratic<br>elite that that you can help reduce that<br>sense of marginalization and I think a<br>third piece of it and this is a shared<br>interest so there's a common good<br>interest shared interest is on climate<br>change one of the chapters in the<br>textbook is of course on climate change<br>that we are now seeing we all have a<br>shared interest in it<br>and we're seeing a lot of trade issues<br>come up from climate change we just did<br>solar panels solar modules case right<br>with India in the u.s. today and they're<br>issues of national treatment and and<br>that has to be worked out so the very<br>phenomenon that it exists and it is at<br>least partly caused by humanity has to<br>be sort of you know I think you from the<br>knowledge on the bottom line cutting<br>across all of these points is education<br>about globalization is about trade which<br>in the u.s. frankly depends on where you<br>go I mean if you go to a good college<br>prep high schools if you go to good<br>colleges you get on but if you are stuck<br>at a lot of very poorly funded and<br>schools with diminishing funding cutting<br>education budgets it's hard to persuade<br>people about these benefits and what the<br>opportunities often they see more risk<br>and threat and fear which leads to<br>prejudice then they do opportunity<br>Baltimore is going to come here as a<br>classes from water both position<br>absolute you don't come okay well then<br>we're going to have to wrap this up on<br>because you said good works like crystal<br>let me thank professor of ala Raj and<br>professor Kelsey Jay and this is a<br>fantastic opportunity to have to rule<br>leading experts on issues related trade<br>and globalization in one room together I<br>hope we get to do this again obviously a<br>lot of issues going forward so watch<br>this space and thank you all the<br>students who came<br>above all this is not the official end<br>of Rogers international trade law class<br>I do but so the last contributor what's<br>your book the last thing to do is come<br>up and get your books thank you for<br>coming thank them for according this and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
