accurate.</p><p>shall we roll so our real Dean makes a<br>point of whatever he can attending<br>inaugural addresses for new professors<br>he is unavoidably unable to be here<br>today so since his apologies and here<br>that's where the deputized<br>that's a my name is jackal Silla and on<br>the deputy Dean and it's a particular<br>pleasure for me to introduce my<br>first I should leave it at that<br>except to to to apologize to her for<br>years oh I thought that her name was<br>pronounced broad and I've had this wrong<br>forever which includes me Oh Jimmy Brown<br>was an Oakland undergraduate and am a<br>psychology student and went on to win a<br>Commonwealth scholarship to go to<br>Loughborough University in the UK to be<br>repaired she returned to us as a<br>lecturer in 2001 so this is a pretty<br>rapid rise to professorship and she's<br>been here yeah well I'm impressed too<br>and of course he's spent various periods<br>of leave at other places at the<br>University of the West of England<br>Columbia University in the City<br>University of New York and as I recall<br>some time teaching in Tehran in Iran<br>which causes a considerable passport<br>difficulties in the county or in these<br>days so she's interested in knowledge at<br>the Nexus of the scientific the<br>socio-cultural the popular and the<br>personal she's and you'll hear a lot<br>about worse things tonight I think she's<br>a feminist and critical psychologist as<br>many of her more than hundred papers<br>consumed ingerbord secured<br>the second line of research that she<br>wrote for our scholarship that she's<br>engaged it is about qualitative research<br>in general and in particular semantic<br>analysis her book successful qualitative<br>research should go in for beginners<br>practical day received the distinguished<br>publication award from the US<br>Association for women in psychology and<br>her paper you know a poor durability<br>her paper on thematic analysis with<br>Victoria Clarke is not quite yet it is<br>by a factor of two the most cited<br>with nearly 30 thousand citations<br>incidentally the next most most heavily<br>cited is Dave Croft kicks paper on the<br>Higgs boson and the range of these two<br>things I think nicely illustrates the<br>strength that our faculty tax and the<br>pride that we take in the range and<br>variety and diversity of scholarship on<br>offer within the faculty jenny was also<br>co-editor for seven years of feminism<br>and psychology and I think a founding<br>editor not that old she's not a fan of<br>it as I said we're gonna tuck<br>professorship often and for this we're<br>gonna read this one out carefully for<br>which that journal received the award<br>for distinguished leadership on behalf<br>of women in psychology from the<br>Committee on women and psychology of the<br>American Psychological Association in<br>2013 which is a great honor so with all<br>of that expertise she was a natural<br>choice for the new position that we<br>established relatively recently of<br>associate dean equity in the Faculty of<br>science we're very proud of Jenny and<br>wouldn't forward to hearing what she has<br>thank you Doug<br>that may preempt some of my points I'm<br>going to make in a manner in a teeny<br>total in our Carmen Aki or ten fre<br>wananga tena koutou katoa<br>hey Maha akuto

RK is<br>kaity a curry of this land in that<br>privilege I am humbled and somewhat<br>relieved I have to say after all the<br>apologies I received today that you were<br>all here to hear my thoughts and I hope<br>that there will be at least something<br>for everyone so welcome and thank you<br>for coming<br>noreda tena koutou tena koutou tena tato<br>katoa I vividly remember the cold<br>November morning when I woke to find the<br>world had shared sideways or maybe<br>backwards or both<br>after eventually going to sleep late<br>reassured via a chat with a friend in<br>New York that it was going to be ok the<br>first thing I saw when I awoke a few<br>hours later was the New York Times alert<br>that Trump had won well let's go<br>forwards on the slides yeah there we are<br>Trump had won it's not an overstatement<br>to say that my chakras visceral much<br>like it had been with brexit some time<br>earlier but more so and not just because<br>I'm one of the out of touch liberal<br>elite I may be but more on that later<br>the visceral shock came from the sense<br>that again values so fundamentally<br>opposite to my own seem to have won hate<br>it seemed to triumphed and I know that<br>that claim that this was about hate has<br>been disputed but let's just pack then<br>it seemed like the good world that I had<br>always implicitly imagined us working<br>towards despite various evidence to the<br>contrary had not just scurried but<br>actually sprinted into the shadows I<br>walked to my conference in a state of<br>shock the fact that it was a gender<br>summit focusing on gender equity and<br>STEM science technology engineering and<br>maths for those non science people was<br>not lost on me the US had voted in a<br>president whose gender politics can be<br>described as dubious at best and who is<br>also profoundly anti science I'll break<br>it off the critiques of these marches<br>around lack of diversity and inclusivity<br>but we'll come back again to the<br>question of politics and knowledge and<br>to the Christians of who gets to be in<br>the room and whose science and whose<br>knowledge as it is is it that we're<br>talking about I will argue that we<br>cannot separate the personal from the<br>political from knowledge and nor should<br>we want to the contrast with day one of<br>the conference with the palpable energy<br>after we'd started in the European<br>Parliament and who wouldn't take a<br>selfie right was stack the conference<br>felt muted stand many speakers<br>acknowledged the election to do so or to<br>not do so would have seen remiss somehow<br>now I was aware that Trump's election<br>affected me in indirect ways through his<br>politics and the way he would shape the<br>world I was aware as a woman and a<br>feminist that many things I valued<br>personally and politically would be<br>under attack from Trump's election I was<br>aware that Trump's election affected me<br>through the impact it had on friends in<br>the u.s. who occupy identities directly<br>under attack within his rhetoric and as<br>we've now seen his policies people I<br>love and care about and people they love<br>and care about what I wasn't aware at<br>the time was the way Trump's election<br>has affected my experience around being<br>a scholar not an obvious ways but in<br>profoundly unsettling and quite the<br>existential ways so today which<br>coincidentally in the u.s. at least was<br>Trump's birthday<br>I decided to focus on what it means to<br>me to be a critical scholar a critical<br>social scientist in the current era I<br>was given pause to question my orienting<br>this talk around Trump and don't worry<br>it's not all gonna be about him when<br>reading have a Princeton professor who<br>recently can't sort of talk due to death<br>threats after they had criticized Trump<br>and a commencement address we live in<br>troubling times and yet my<br>vulnerabilities here are not deep I am<br>flying to the US and two weeks and<br>Doug's alluded to my visa issues so<br>we'll see how that goes but my pause was<br>only brief many scholars have spoken up<br>against Trump's flexible position on<br>truth has alternative facts or lies some<br>have argued for the power of the truth<br>and it's really not hard to be it's hard<br>not to be drawn instantly to such a<br>powerful full-page statement from The<br>New York Times to go yes and pump your<br>fists like a male tennis player who's<br>just won at Wimbledon others have<br>reiterated the value effects but at the<br>same time recognizing that fact for<br>truth are not really the point we're in<br>a battle over whose story counts whose<br>truth counts this is where I'll come<br>back to the intersections around<br>knowledge what counts<br>who counts and what might it mean to me<br>being an academic critical scholar at a<br>university and our tour right now messy<br>politics professor Richard Shaw who<br>highlighted that Trump's tenuous<br>relationship with the truth bludgeoning<br>disregard of evidence and argument with<br>which it disagrees and anti diluvian<br>views on the nature and role of science<br>are deeply problematic stated in this<br>commentary that the role of the<br>university is to create and publicly<br>disseminate knowledge of the human<br>condition and the world in which we live<br>and that this requires openness to<br>different points of view acceptance that<br>knowledge is best pursued in a<br>systematic manner and a willingness to<br>be proven wrong yes first pomp moment<br>is he talking about what I'm talking<br>about my alternative title for this talk<br>was Trump stole my ontology I thought<br>that would pull a crowd of zero but<br>maybe from the last knot you can relax<br>even though you're a captive audience<br>I'll mostly leave theory to one side but<br>very basically ontology is concerned<br>with how we think about reality about<br>truth and for researchers how we<br>conceptualize what it is that we study<br>what we think we're able to get at and<br>understand and how and why we think this<br>matters for the things I study mostly<br>related to gendered bodies sex and<br>sexuality and health I ask what reality<br>is being made here what is being made<br>possible what is being made impossible<br>what stories about things are becoming<br>truths and how can we interrupt that<br>facts are interesting but they are not<br>my currency stories are stories but<br>based on good analysis Trump stole my<br>ontology because he suddenly made being<br>a scholar who doesn't believe in truth<br>with a capital T whose currency is not<br>facts a much more precarious thing that<br>who had been before maybe even a<br>politically irresponsible thing an<br>indefensible thing I'm going to argue<br>that critical scholarship isn't<br>undefensible and probably isn't<br>irresponsible though we probably always<br>are in moments of complicity even as we<br>critique<br>I'm going to reflect on what it now<br>means to be a critical scholar to be a<br>scholar for whom truth is not simple and<br>whose knowledge frameworks have been<br>undermined by the rise of alternative<br>facts the ontology and epistemology that<br>underpin my work the ideas about reality<br>and what counts as knowledge about what<br>my task is as a scholar risk being<br>aligned with the position on truth that<br>Trump displays we critical scholars or<br>scholars who support different knowledge<br>and truth frameworks than the mainstream<br>scientific model or the wider popular<br>cultural common sense about what counts<br>as knowledge though this is changing we<br>were already in a complex place of<br>raising our voices seemingly against<br>science the context of that task is<br>quite different now<br>now these battles around truth and<br>validity have tentacles that grip deep<br>into scholarly and social history some<br>colleagues who work with motto rangamati<br>for instance still have battles to claim<br>validity for indigenous knowledge<br>frameworks we had our very own crisis in<br>social psychology around knowledge and<br>validity decades ago so these are not<br>unfamiliar questions to many of us but<br>to me as the scholar I am and the<br>positions I occupy it feels like the<br>ground has shifted and unsettling not<br>unlike an earthquake previously I<br>considered being post truth in a<br>singular sense a position I occupied<br>happily not without threat I've alluded<br>to the crisis and social psychology and<br>debates about ontology epistemology and<br>validity still go on but now it's<br>complicated so the election of Trump<br>threw me into a potentially endless<br>academic existential spin<br>now you may wonder why I chose this<br>picture but in my alternative fantasy<br>career I'd be an astronaut so I couldn't<br>resist eight months ago<br>thus Inaugural would have been a quite<br>different beast but tonight I aim to<br>weave together a range of different<br>strands using this moment to reflect on<br>myself as a scholar where I've come from<br>the scholarship I do and why critical<br>scholarship matters even now maybe<br>especially now and because I don't think<br>we can ever separate out the person the<br>political and the socio-cultural from<br>what we do especially for critical<br>social scientists as I'm more about<br>subjectivity than objectivity this talk<br>will be personal you could argue it's<br>actually going to be an extended<br>justification for what I do but that has<br>become a really complicated question how<br>do I justify a critical scholarship that<br>focus on sometimes apparently trivial<br>matters frivolous matters the making and<br>unmaking of sex gender sexuality<br>gendered bodies and health and times<br>like these when material brutalities<br>impact and ongoing ways in the lives of<br>so many new zealand's shockingly<br>unacceptable rates of violence and<br>particularly sexual and domestic<br>violence our increasing poverty in the<br>ripple out effects associated with that<br>in the intersections with gender and<br>race our ongoing colonial context and<br>all sorts of manifestations of racism<br>and implicit as well as explicit parky<br>how norms that produce ongoing<br>entrenched inequities and in justices<br>and which impede well-being and tino<br>rangatiratanga photography NOAA our<br>shocking and heartbreaking<br>mental health and suicide statistics and<br>that's just a start and that's just here<br>climate change and its impact on our<br>Pacific neighbors the worldwide refugee<br>crisis we live in troubling times both<br>locally and globally which such pressing<br>and punishing issues how can I justify a<br>critical scholarship and especially<br>scholarship that doesn't aim to provide<br>solutions especially not easy<br>Solutions I don't know if I can fully<br>but I'm making as part of remaking which<br>is necessary for change and within a<br>whole system of scholarship many<br>different voices approaches and<br>perspectives can not only be useful but<br>vital when I look back across my career<br>a key thread is going against the grain<br>I couldn't believe it when I found this<br>bumper thing many many years ago as you<br>might pick out from the picture so I<br>stand here before you and I don't look<br>that much of a rebel now in case you're<br>doubting me I google image search Google<br>of course being the answer for<br>everything<br>definitely not me rebellion is<br>constructed by Google images at least as<br>all masculine male I look and sound<br>educated pocky ha middle class I look<br>and sound privileged one of the liberal<br>elite currently under a tech but who are<br>also sometimes fighting back I am indeed<br>those things educated parkie ha<br>middle class privileged but that's only<br>part of the story and what it conceals<br>as as relevant to me as a scholar as<br>what it reveals I was born into an era<br>of protest anti-war anti-nuclear women's<br>rights land rights my earliest memories<br>are of protest my mother who was a true<br>rebel unlike me a black sheep and her<br>farming family socially politically<br>committed to left social justice causes<br>took me along at least sometimes<br>engaging me in politics from early on<br>instilling the idea that we can and<br>should try to change our worlds but then<br>she took me out of that world aged 4 we<br>left semi-normal society for life on a<br>remote hippie commune in the<br>beautiful Hokianga hills my normal which<br>I came to know was most definitely not<br>the normal became a truly<br>countercultural life for at least the<br>next eight years remote meant no road<br>access about a thirty minute walking<br>into these hills it meant most of the<br>dwellings at least at first had dirt<br>floors no running water<br>certainly no electricity<br>it meant cooking over open fires it<br>meant no car semi self-sufficiency and a<br>commitment to an anti materialist life<br>now those who know how many boxes my<br>currently being renovated home holds<br>will laugh at that last point it meant a<br>childhood without the popular cultural<br>references of my peers do not ask me<br>anything about the 70s and 80s and I<br>wonder if that's why I find popular<br>culture no it meant poverty a bag of<br>caramel popcorn was a highlight of one<br>Christmas and I took weeks to eat it I<br>was probably disgusting but I treasured<br>it as a child I couldn't imagine buying<br>new clothes or shoes I vividly recall<br>hearing a casual comment about friends<br>who had stayed in a motel on a trip and<br>wondered if I would ever stay in a motel<br>it seemed as unlikely and as desirable<br>as my fantasy alternative career of<br>being an astronaut and everyone here who<br>travels to work will probably appreciate<br>the irony of that this isn't a whoa was<br>me trip down memory lane telling our<br>personal stories examining ourselves the<br>practice of reflexivity has to have a<br>purpose I am interested in my story of<br>getting to be here for two reasons to<br>ask what it can tell me about myself as<br>a scholar and because I care about<br>issues of justice and change and<br>inclusivity and participation with an<br>education on the second point my<br>question is how does this girl get to be<br>this woman stay<br>here today embodying of seemingly very<br>different reality to the one I've just<br>described what my story of childhood<br>poverty obscures is the richness and<br>social capital that nonetheless featured<br>my father not an active part of my<br>childhood was a university lecturer and<br>maths I knew that being a lecturer was<br>something you could be I knew that doing<br>a PhD was a thing my mother also to<br>Cherie educated had been and was again<br>later a teacher I hated school I was<br>bullied we happy kids occupied the<br>lowest rung in what felt to me like a<br>clear tripartite social hierarchy the so<br>described redneck our kids on the<br>top the normal kids the Maori kids the<br>population majority in the middle and<br>asked mostly pacquiao hippie kids at the<br>bottom of course it's more complex than<br>that but that's what it felt like no one<br>wanted to be our friends we don't even<br>want to be each other's friends at<br>school<br>and I tell this not as part of some<br>oppression Olympics where I claim to<br>really be more oppressed than other<br>people but because it framed my formal<br>educational encounters in that context a<br>decile one school my teachers by and<br>large didn't engage me it didn't feel<br>like my place I didn't feel like I<br>belonged even so I experienced some<br>agency around education on the occasions<br>I resisted or refused to go to school I<br>wasn't forced<br>when I found my primary school reports<br>in my twenties I was shocked at just how<br>poor my attendance actually was by<br>myself however I read voraciously and I<br>lived in a creative and<br>socio-politically engaged environment<br>encouraged to be practical inquisitive<br>and independent I made lifelong hippie<br>kid friendships in Kura I am delighted<br>wherever you are that you have made it<br>here and I know that the rest of your<br>father who want to be here are here in<br>spirit mum and I moved to Auckland just<br>before my teens despite a desperate<br>adolescent wish to be normal it was<br>never meant to be mum was teaching it<br>and I went to a Steiner school my non<br>mainstream education there again<br>encouraged independent learning<br>inquisitiveness and creativity through<br>non specialization their education<br>encouraged thinking and non strictly<br>disciplinary limited ways I loved school<br>then and learned and that context to<br>love learning<br>my teachers engaged me and I lucked into<br>a particularly academically inclined<br>class yet when I finished school I<br>didn't come to university as I'm decided<br>about the future enjoying being a<br>skateboarder one of just two girls<br>skaters in Auckland at the time see<br>really a rebel<br>and I chose instead to work in an<br>alternative skate shop blue tal lounge<br>for those of you who misses still<br>University was hard to imagine it felt<br>foreign removed but I got to uni a year<br>later bored and having decided I wanted<br>to be a clinical psychologist of course<br>starting as an undergraduate Unni was<br>confounding I was lost bewildered<br>overwhelmed I had no people here but<br>when I found them that made the<br>difference<br>for the very first what grabbed me in<br>Psych was the critical the feminist the<br>ideas and approaches that push<br>boundaries that sort connections between<br>knowledge and the socio-political<br>at the end of my second year I hounded<br>by now colleague Nicola gave Ian to<br>supervising an independent research<br>project she had a plan to give one but<br>she allowed me to convince her and that<br>I am forever grateful for I'd pretty<br>much given away clinical at their point<br>knowledge was what enchanted me and<br>still at the end of my BA I left<br>overseas drawn by the obligatory<br>middle-class ha Olli well Jonas<br>Farris Melbourne where the plan was to<br>work in in money to be able to afford<br>noe I mentioned this because I wasn't<br>committed to academic it was a<br>possibility not an inevitability there<br>are there are so many tenuous moments in<br>a career that looks from the outside so<br>seamless that it must be planned I was<br>brought back by the offer of a master's<br>scholarship for a kid like me without<br>financial resources without parents who<br>could support any tertiary study and in<br>a context of user pays education this<br>was what made the difference if we want<br>to facilitate the education of kids from<br>non-traditional backgrounds Maori kids<br>kids from equity groups poor kids into<br>extended tertiary study which I do we<br>have to look at the enablers and the<br>retainers what gets those kids in our<br>doors and what keeps them there we are<br>of course looking at this as a faculty<br>in a universe<br>but in my experience it was money that<br>scholarship meant I could choose to stay<br>and make this my place money matters by<br>the time I started postgraduate study I<br>had a sense of belonging within the<br>university a sense that this could be my<br>place that belonging was mostly based in<br>the pleasure of intellectual pursuits as<br>well as an easy fit between the pocky ha<br>middle-class values and individualized<br>identity I embodied in the spaces and<br>places of this institution these spaces<br>are implicitly classed and raced and<br>gendered among other things which<br>challenges belonging for many of those<br>we would want to belong a Commonwealth<br>scholarship to do my doctorate and<br>social sciences at Loughborough<br>University in England made another<br>previously impossible pathway possible<br>it was an incredible expanding<br>experience with many outstanding<br>doctoral student peers mentors and<br>scholars including my doctoral<br>supervisors the renowned feminist<br>psychologist sue Wilkinson and Celia<br>Curtsinger and an or grow is such a<br>focus on the end of the jaw but the many<br>people colleagues vano friends students<br>mentors who have inspired shaped prodded<br>and pulled me are the invisible cloak<br>that surrounds my career I can't<br>acknowledge everyone in this talk by<br>name but I want to especially<br>acknowledge my PhD comrade-in-arms and<br>now regular collaborator Victoria Clarke<br>this year we reached the dizzy and<br>wearing matching feminist killjoy<br>necklaces I doubt PBRs will value that<br>Victoria is one of those scholars whose<br>fierce intellect doesn't let you get<br>away with sloppy thinking who also goes<br>against the grain<br>our collaboration as co-authors began<br>when we wrote on my first sabbatical a<br>methodology paper that Bruce synthesized<br>some of our frustrations with<br>qualitative research and offered<br>something new we wrote this because I<br>was burned out and in meltdown and it<br>felt achievable and even possibly fun it<br>was fun to our surprise that went on to<br>do the academic equivalent of going<br>viral as thangka suggested for better<br>and carry you'll be happy to hear me say<br>this sometimes for worse<br>leading us both into an unanticipated<br>and ongoing field of scholarly endeavor<br>writing and thinking about qualitative<br>researching this aspect of my<br>scholarship has had the most impact<br>globally shaping the scholarship of<br>others I find it easy to dismiss this<br>but scholars whose knowledge approaches<br>may be under contestation need to do<br>robust work talking about method<br>methodology and knowledge and purpose as<br>a part of that I note too that this<br>faculty features strongly as a global<br>contributor to this aspect of<br>scholarship Ross Oaxaca and Statistics<br>through developing our for example my<br>amazing psyche now colleague Maggie<br>Wetherill although not developed here<br>the significance and substance of her<br>contribution to discourse analysis and<br>psychosocial researching as well as the<br>deeper questions about what we're<br>actually doing in social psychology<br>cannot be underestimated<br>I'm not staking a claim to a place at<br>their table I mean they both have<br>Wikipedia entries I don't<br>if anyone wants to make one but it's<br>interesting to notice when we often<br>focus on end value what we find rather<br>than the how we find it both in academia<br>and more widely the place and role of<br>the University and us within it as a hot<br>topic of critical conversation right now<br>this focus is grounded and recognition<br>that the world has shared sideways and<br>many of us have much privilege and still<br>having some freedom to defend values and<br>scholarship which might be under threat<br>with increasing pressure on this<br>obviously applied disciplines we need to<br>continue to support the arts humanities<br>critical thinking and knowledge<br>seemingly for knowledge sake both to<br>disrupt the narrative and because it's<br>short-sighted not to do so our futures<br>cannot fully be imagined from now recent<br>times have seen much discussion about<br>the employability of university<br>graduates that tends to look outwards<br>rather than back at ourselves and ask<br>what makes good future academics and<br>indeed how we see those academics as<br>contributing to the construction of a<br>future fairer more just society as we<br>butt up against a time of seemingly<br>increasing social division a time of<br>precarity in all sorts of ways a time of<br>alternate effects and post truthless I<br>believe we need a community of scholars<br>who are critical who are questioning and<br>who are rebels who ask uncomfortable<br>questions and are encouraged to do so<br>scholars who haven't taken the blue pill<br>it's analogy doesn't quite work with the<br>red pill that truth kind of thing but<br>stick with them scholars who support a<br>multiplicity of located truths but<br>recognize context in the various ways we<br>might judge quality of different truths<br>scholars like my former students and now<br>colleague Jade leg rice who was<br>developing knowledge and practice for<br>psychology granted and motto rangamati<br>deploying indigenous critical and<br>decolonizing frameworks to push back<br>against to resist and challenge the<br>dominant pacquiao<br>often deficit-based framings and our<br>implicit ideas about what counts as<br>knowledge which is linked to policy<br>practice and indeed the construction<br>with decimation and dealer determine of<br>different truths and reality's different<br>imagined futures neoliberalism has<br>brought all sorts of pressures and<br>challenges maybe I should say<br>opportunities as scholars we're<br>increasingly encouraged to think and<br>deliberate and strategic terms to engage<br>in planning activities where do you see<br>yourself in five years<br>from 10 years and so on to be good<br>neoliberal subjects rational agents who<br>manage our activities in our intellects<br>according to an implicitly economically<br>rationalized model the ephemeral the<br>coincidental the effective and the<br>random a sidelined or obscured those who<br>know me well won't be surprised to hear<br>me say I hate this model I'm hopeless at<br>it I never planned a career and I don't<br>make choices based on any strategy I<br>acknowledge the privilege and being able<br>to both say and do that I had a secure a<br>job straight out of my PhD I have<br>succeeded in that job that I'm giving an<br>inaugural makes it impossible to deny<br>that though it hasn't been without<br>challenges and complications and I want<br>to thank the heads and Dean's who have<br>been completely supportive the<br>colleagues who have gone above and<br>beyond in their support and my students<br>who have been more than understanding<br>I want to disrupt the suggestion that<br>individual success just reflects the<br>talent of the individual far from it I<br>believe those of us in secure positions<br>have some obligation to recognize and<br>use that privilege to speak up and out<br>sometimes four but ideally with those<br>who are less able to but always in a way<br>which recognizes our positionality our<br>privilege and keeps those open to<br>interrogation and to shut up when the<br>time is right<br>recognizing that our worlds are<br>constantly being made and to question<br>that making to interrupt or even stop<br>that making if it's working against<br>social justice against progressive<br>agendas towards more inclusive and good<br>world to me a good world is one<br>characterised by less social division<br>and inequality and more scope and<br>support for people to be who they are in<br>the myriad of ways they live their lives<br>without harming others through<br>assumption order addiction so less harm<br>more opportunity more valuing of<br>diversity that's why I couldn't start my<br>talk any other way than with Trump in<br>New Zealand speaking truth to power is<br>that just possibility it's an obligation<br>the role of universities and academics<br>within them to be critic and conscience<br>of society is enshrined in law this is<br>so these five words critic and<br>conscience of society is one of the best<br>things about academia in New Zealand to<br>me and others also agree but I would say<br>that of course because it fits my<br>countercultural questioning the norm<br>tendencies it validates provides a<br>legitimizing framework for work which<br>questions and challenges the status quo<br>which considers the implications of the<br>shifts and changes from the micro to the<br>macro in our society our politics our<br>technologies and our psychologies work<br>which isn't directly applied<br>the sense of opportunity and obligation<br>is why I value the equity work I do<br>within the university even if at the<br>same time my constant travel companion<br>is the question of how much my<br>privileged position still inadvertently<br>dominates or marginalize others<br>recognizing that despite my various<br>experiences as a parking a person coming<br>from middle-class social if not material<br>capital this place could become an easy<br>fit for me important questions for this<br>process are what makes belonging not<br>only possible but likely for the<br>different people who come through our<br>doors the university is having a role in<br>making the common good linked to the<br>waiter sherry education is<br>conceptualized and structured those two<br>are intertwined the material and the<br>discursive go hand-in-hand as either for<br>personal gain the dominant model and<br>neoliberal context like our own which<br>fosters competition and often fails to<br>disrupt social inequities in any<br>substantial way or as thought about as<br>for a public or common good a place<br>through which social inequity can be<br>challenged and which as less can<br>connected to personal competition and<br>advancement this is an important part of<br>the conversation a continual unmaking of<br>the norms that seep and the norms seep<br>in for the last part of this talk I'll<br>connect this to my topic oriented<br>research reflecting back as this talk<br>gave me pause to do I can see I'm<br>interested in ontology in the production<br>of realities of realities for people of<br>the realities of bodies and sex and<br>sexuality but in terms of possibility<br>rather than thinking in a deterministic<br>way I don't map causal relationships<br>between x and y i'm not interested in<br>those humans are too complex my<br>colleague nicola gave 'i who after my<br>earlier successful hounding supervised<br>my master's thesis encouraged me to go<br>away and do a PhD encouraged me to come<br>back<br>has been an exceptional mentor colleague<br>and friend talks in her work<br>about sexual coercion and rape of the<br>cultural conditions of possibility this<br>is what I'm getting it what I'm<br>interested in understanding<br>representation and practice but to ask<br>what they make possible what they make<br>difficult unlikely or impossible I ask<br>how is this particular thing made sense<br>of what ideas does that rely on what<br>ideas does it reproduce and what my the<br>implications of that be language matters<br>representation matters it is not PC gone<br>mad to care about these things they are<br>fundamental the way we represent and<br>talk about bodies and people and bits of<br>our bodies create certain conditions of<br>possibility around those bodies around<br>how we might feel about them and what we<br>might do with them language and<br>representation create truths and the<br>words of another inspiring colleague and<br>mentor and friend the scholar and<br>activist Leonor Tifa author of the first<br>ever non textbook I bought as an<br>undergraduate stretching my student loan<br>it matters whether our metaphors around<br>sex are of digestion or of dancing and<br>in case you're wondering it should be<br>dancing so now to genitalia this was<br>going to be inevitable you cannot spend<br>the majority of your career studying<br>genitalia and not talk about them and<br>your inaugural initially I had an<br>apology but then apology itself as part<br>of the problem<br>an apology constricts genitalia is not<br>quite right to talk about what a<br>geologist apologize for talking about<br>earthquakes someone may<br>maybe yes who knows<br>so genitalia just the other day a friend<br>sent me an IFL science story decrying a<br>new product being sold for vaginal<br>improvement so-called oak galls are sort<br>of burr produced by the tree after a<br>gall wasp and so it's larvae into it<br>according to IFL the popular crafty site<br>Etsy had been selling this natural<br>product marketing as an organic way to<br>clean and heal and tighten the vagina<br>apparently you insert it as a ground-up<br>paste and it stings and when it's all<br>sorts of wonders<br>this made media around the world<br>including here no doubt because it was<br>framed us somehow freakish who are these<br>crazy people who buy such crazy remedies<br>but it is anything but random freak<br>product the problem it's being sold on<br>the problems that cures are far from<br>random it would appeal to Gwyneth<br>Paltrow she waits lyrical about vaginal<br>steaming in 2015 in the world media<br>obsessed momentarily mostly with<br>cisgendered women trying it and<br>reporting experiences from the<br>transformative to the horrific my then<br>honor student Tycho Vandenberg and I<br>analyzed representations around virginal<br>steaming identifying the ways in which<br>they rely on and reproduce certain ideas<br>about cisgender womanhood and female<br>genitalia for those unfamiliar with the<br>term cisgender often abbreviated Circe<br>refers to people whose birth sex and<br>gender identities match in contrast a<br>chance gendered or gender non-binary or<br>some intersex people despite various<br>critiques<br>it has usefully been adopted to name and<br>therefore disrupt the invisible norm and<br>as part of conceptual and political<br>action 2d pathologize and D marginalize<br>non-binary fluid and transgender<br>identities to shift the common sense<br>assumption that everyone is naturally or<br>should be sex and gender aligned and<br>discreetly so and<br>River that common sense means that any<br>other identity needs to be explained or<br>accounted for<br>while cisgender people can live and<br>blissful ignorance if they wish this is<br>not just semantics the very high rates<br>of violence experienced by trans and<br>gender non-conforming people show the<br>material impacts of how our society<br>arranges itself the use of a term as a<br>way of recognizing and naming the<br>typically invisible privilege that goes<br>along with fitting norms footing the<br>common-sense assumptions that get<br>articulated in society all of the time<br>it aligns with earlier theorizing and<br>practice that named straightness or<br>whiteness or here parki harness concepts<br>at our society's we're more familiar and<br>comfortable with but which still need<br>work those gall wasps were back the<br>latest in a very long line of diverse<br>products designed to fix the problem<br>that is the vagina in the first half of<br>the 20th century women were marketed<br>multiple detergent products like lye<br>soul as a deuce to resolve feminine<br>hygiene issues and therefore in sewer<br>heterosexual marital fidelity through<br>appropriate embodied and psychological<br>femininity the idea of the vagina or<br>vulva as smelly as part of our<br>socio-cultural narrative about these<br>body parts when I was doing my doctorate<br>looking at women's accounts and<br>socio-cultural representations of the<br>vagina<br>using the colloquial way to refer to<br>everything down there that title took me<br>some of the nastiest of the genital<br>slang terms I collected and analyzed<br>evoked stinkiness I won't repeat those<br>terms here but slang terms for penis and<br>testicles did not evoke discussed or<br>revulsion and nearly the same evocative<br>way what does it mean for people to grow<br>up in a context where that truth is<br>imparted through language and<br>advertising women participants in my<br>research exist expressed perhaps the<br>deepest anxiety about smell and that<br>isn't surprising we've been told again<br>and again that the vagina involve I have<br>a smell problem and that the smell<br>problem needs constant vigilance and<br>that it needs to be dealt with and we<br>are still being told this<br>socio-culturally to have a vagina and or<br>revolver as to have an always<br>potentially defective body an abject<br>body now we could imagine such ads as<br>responding to a problem maybe women<br>really had or have poor hygiene and need<br>a product to help them and their<br>husbands let's not forget about them<br>alternatively we might read women's<br>uptake of products through advertising<br>as reflecting ignorant or the ignorance<br>of the time this idea of ignorance has<br>some validity in terms of options for<br>responding it forms the basis for much<br>health policy and practice for instance<br>including sexuality education both that<br>informally online and that formerly<br>delivered and is also imparted through<br>various media yet another way to explain<br>all this is that solis us women<br>unnecessarily worry about their vaginas<br>just learn to love your body and it'll<br>all be ok the last decade or so has seen<br>a slew of these love your vagina type<br>online media they are part of a wider<br>movement towards information and<br>acceptance and it's hard not to be<br>critical are to be critical of that<br>however in these the problem in the<br>solution are located in the hearts and<br>minds of individual women and the words<br>of another inspiring colleague and<br>friend and a little bit earlier than me<br>laughs Brett alum Rosalind Gill this<br>completely ex-cop AIT's wider culture in<br>hostile surveillance of women's bodies I<br>am interested in a different story than<br>these explanations I am NOT interested<br>in the question of whether or not people<br>really need to use virginal deodorizers<br>or dose them for the record they do not<br>I want to know how a certain realities<br>and truths produced in and through<br>discourse and representation like this<br>I'm interested in what reality is being<br>created here<br>I understand these products marketing<br>campaigns media representations<br>discourses is producing a reality in<br>which the vagina can only be understood<br>it's potentially flawed potentially<br>always in need of attention vigilance in<br>action products to fix the vagina or fix<br>the vulva both rely on and reproduce the<br>ontological state of the vagina a truth<br>of potential or active defectiveness<br>let's look at genital cosmetic surgery<br>and the last year of my PhD the<br>so-called designer vagina had headlines<br>the 21st century started with this shiny<br>new thing in almost every glossy women's<br>magazine featured a story the media<br>frenzy partly resulted from two<br>california-based surgeons who use PR<br>consultants to sell the story in masks<br>the procedures early accounts from<br>surgeons who I interviewed and the media<br>framed the surgery as uncomplicated and<br>psychologically and sexually<br>transformative this story highlights an<br>aspect that sometimes gets lit out of<br>critical and discourse work that<br>commercial genus or distress is<br>profitable many people are making money<br>off genital distress however was in the<br>20-10 neoliberal discourses of because<br>you're worth it and love your body<br>loving your vagina Oh<br>becomes a site for profit remove your<br>hair for Jaisal remember that bleach dye<br>your labia steam insert Ogle's the<br>possibilities are endless and the<br>contemporary context where a neoliberal<br>self-improving person has come to<br>dominate our ideal of proper gendered<br>personhood feminist concepts like<br>empowerment have been co-opted into the<br>work of selling often selling products<br>that rely on but also reinforced<br>gendered embodied not quite right now<br>there's an ontological State for women<br>we should care about things like oak<br>galls and oak galls and vagina steaming<br>because not justice women's genital and<br>bodily distress and anxiety our<br>embodiment and effectivity have become a<br>business opportunity with newly<br>developed modes to sell solutions women<br>are being sold at best and unnecessary<br>and at worst risky product or service<br>but it goes deeper products and services<br>are seller solutions to general distress<br>do the work of truth production to thus<br>ontology Singh has potentially profound<br>ramifications the Alicia transformations<br>and people's tastes desires preferences<br>and practices for their consumptions the<br>very idea of who one can be and how one<br>could or should act as a person with a<br>vagina gets produced what is one day<br>unheard of may another day become<br>culturally normative unquestioned look<br>at the rise in numbers having genital<br>cosmetic surgery and I think these are<br>underestimates think of women and leg<br>and underarm hair removal normative<br>barely disrupted by feminist challengers<br>despite moments and individuals yet less<br>than a century old norms are pesky<br>things I see disentangling understanding<br>and challenging them hopefully before<br>they embed as a task of my critical<br>scholarship but how has a critical<br>scholar can I interrupt<br>what is our version of the science<br>communication model for telling these<br>alternative stories do the media provide<br>the answer<br>as a critical scholar I have a<br>complicated position with media if you<br>work in areas like I do it's easy but<br>deeply problematic to position media as<br>the enemy this risks very reductionist<br>and problematically simple causative<br>models I've done some work with Nicola<br>Gavi and others around pornography<br>pornography has become a quick-fire<br>scapegoat why does this women get<br>cosmetic surgery on their genitalia<br>they've seen too many vulvas in porn<br>why is complete pubic hair removal now<br>common amongst us women because it's<br>commonplace in pornography and so on I'm<br>not going to say that pornography has no<br>relationship with how people feel about<br>their bodies and what they do with their<br>bodies what their psychosexual embodied<br>affective responses and desires might be<br>of course it can and we're increasingly<br>hearing about it but that relationship<br>is more complicated nuanced than these<br>simplified causative accounts suggest<br>moreover and Nicola will be pleased I'm<br>saying this because she's always pushing<br>me to justify any claims to norms that I<br>make when we make such statements we<br>aren't just revealing truth or maybe<br>misrepresenting truth we are also<br>constituting realities through language<br>discourse and representation as critical<br>scholars we are both the truth breakers<br>and truth makers through the stories<br>that we ourselves tell and let's not<br>forget these can be there can be and<br>there is lots of fun in those activities<br>of telling different stories but what<br>does this mean for engaging media if we<br>think the conversation matters this much<br>we need to be part of it as part of our<br>critic and conscience role it's easy to<br>want to avoid especially when we're<br>hammered for using big and complicated<br>words although sometimes new words are<br>necessary to make new things possible<br>without recourse to facts without simple<br>truths and we're always telling a<br>counter normative story however that's<br>not an is as easy a task as simply<br>converting big words to little ones<br>but a few years ago I attended the<br>first-ever World Congress of cosmetic<br>line ecology as an incognito observer i<br>coincidentally sat beside a journalist<br>from cosmopolitan who across the day got<br>visibly more and more disturbed i<br>introduced myself gave him my card and<br>suggested she get in touch if she wrote<br>a story and wanted some alternate<br>effects<br>she did and wrote a long and scolding Li<br>brutal attack on the industry that had<br>impact and it made me reassess and<br>consider the ways my reluctance is<br>somewhat of an abdication of<br>responsibility of telling critical<br>stories and asking critical questions<br>matter so the collision of two moments<br>promotion and the task of writing and<br>inaugural and Trump's election sent me<br>into somewhat of a spin and have given<br>me pause to reflect and on quite<br>different things than I anticipated I<br>get to the end of writing this talk and<br>all the other narratives and points come<br>crashing in and I want to write a<br>different talk and then a different one<br>all over again but part of our skills<br>should be knowing when to stop and few<br>you might think she's nearly at the end<br>I don't have the answers as to what<br>being a critical scholar and trumped up<br>times means whether I'll ever escape the<br>edge of doubt that some retrenchment<br>effects and truth wouldn't be more<br>beneficial but if we really believe that<br>the making of reality is a continual<br>ongoing process then we have to be its<br>constant companions and making realities<br>at the same time as they're being made<br>we have to look for ways to promote the<br>alternatives that we value to quote the<br>inspiring scholar and activist Michelle<br>fine through pumping elaborated images<br>of what could be I teach my students<br>that critical reflexivity is vital to<br>being good qualitative researchers it is<br>also vital to being a critical scholar<br>in the contemporary environment because<br>values are always part of what we do<br>whether it's objectivity we're touting<br>if we are to progress<br>I couldn't resist putting that and I had<br>to find a way if we are to progress to a<br>better more socially just world we have<br>to be prepared to always question<br>ourselves not believing in a singular<br>truth helps that I think and being<br>slightly unmoored not quite belonging or<br>fitting helps to they make privileged<br>never quite invisible these are my<br>perspectives where we come from shapes<br>who we are shapes what we see and don't<br>see shapes what we value and don't value<br>but we can also change those lenses<br>I was wondering how to finish and I<br>realized that all the people whose<br>influence I have named are amazing<br>strong and inspiring women psychology<br>and Western society have a long history<br>of women blaming and especially mother<br>blaming and so in keeping with being<br>countercultural it seems fitting is a<br>feminist scholar to end with a tribute<br>to those women not an agenda a<br>centralizing way not reinforcing some<br>idea of inherent gender differences and<br>gender binaries but to acknowledge that<br>throughout the contexts of growing up<br>studying and being a scholar<br>it is mostly women who have facilitated<br>encouraged pushed and prodded who<br>enabled me to be here today and<br>especially my mother the rebel who<br>ensured I was in a lost cause to<br>conventionality by raising me counter<br>culturally to Christian norms and resist<br>to protest and to go against the grain<br>I'll finish with a Toki I was<br>sent today which seemed also so apt for<br>this finishing point acknowledging the<br>others the women who have enabled me to<br>fly matter who do who carry determiner<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
