Midland<br>dhbs Metro performance class balance and<br>a and z so clearly someone who is very<br>well cred I to speak this evening so<br>BL thank you much lovely to to be here<br>i' like to start with a kakia that I<br>heard on Monday which I've never said<br>publicly before but I'd like to to start<br>with that so<br>POI<br>who may Clarity be yours may<br>understanding be yours through<br>reflection through personal Endeavor<br>through respect the virtues which bind<br>us as one may we be filled with<br>well-being and so it's my genuine hope<br>tonight I thank you for taking time out<br>of busy lives to invest in your own<br>development and my genuine hope for<br>tonight for you is that um there'll be<br>something that will both stretch and<br>focus your development in the leadership<br>space uh in thinking about accelerating<br>your impact this question around uh what<br>counts as leadership is both I think an<br>intensely personal question and one<br>that's been a sort of a professional<br>focus of mine for the last 25 years<br>personally uh one of the roles I have<br>I'm chair of an eldership in the church<br>think doing that for a couple of years<br>and one of the things if I stand up in<br>front of a group of 400 and say this is<br>where I think we should be Hing into the<br>future um these are the three priorities<br>that are going to be important for us<br>over the next um 12 months this is what<br>we think success looks like if I do so<br>with a degree of enthusiasm and I hope a<br>level of<br>articulateness then there is regularly<br>people who will come up and shake your<br>hand and say or shake my hand and say um<br>that was fantastic leadership<br>and the question that I asked myself and<br>the question I know many of you wrestle<br>with was um did what I just do actually<br>count uh am I doing a good job at this<br>thing that people are calling leadership<br>or am I doing a terrible job of it um<br>and how would I know that I'm paying<br>attention to the the right things and<br>actually not majoring in minors so it's<br>one of the concerns that I would have so<br>it's this question around what council's<br>leadership think one one is intensely<br>personal the other is it's been a<br>professional passion for 25 years so the<br>pleasure of working on New Zealand's<br>first 12month integrated leadership<br>development program in<br>1992 work with a guy who's passed away<br>now a guy called Mike bib um and we ran<br>the 12-month leadership development<br>program out of the belief that you can't<br>develop leaders on a weekend not even a<br>long<br>weekend and in 1992 there weren't any<br>options available for kind of long-term<br>integrated leadership development and so<br>to support both the design and the<br>marketing of that program I did my PhD<br>on Executive perceptions of leadership<br>so 770 New Zealand and Australian middle<br>and Senior executive so you ask them the<br>question um for you what is this thing<br>called leadership and what are the best<br>ways to develop it now for 25 years now<br>I've just been fascinated by how do<br>people make sense of this thing that<br>they call leadership and how does that<br>shape their practice now if you ask 770<br>people what counts as leadership the<br>number one answer uh is in inspires and<br>motivates<br>others um so that part didn't surprise<br>me what percentage of the responses did<br>for this is the audience participation<br>piece if you're looking for a<br>queue<br>89% 5<br>5% so it's somewhere in between there so<br>the the number one thinge when you code<br>through 770 accounts for 16.7% of the<br>total responses<br>uh the issue when you're trying to<br>develop something like that so when I<br>say the word leadership I expect if<br>there's 100 at best 16 of you have a<br>picture in your head right now that's<br>similar to the one that I<br>intend and so with the confusion around<br>what really counts with the diversity of<br>views around what really counts when we<br>think we're having a genuine<br>conversation about leadership very often<br>we're not and so what I want to do<br>tonight in one sense is is I'm going to<br>talk for bits and then get you to work<br>at your tables for a bit uh the<br>worksheets are in your booklets how many<br>of you have got low impulse<br>control if you've got low impulse<br>control I don't want you to flick ahead<br>to the end so I'd like you to stay with<br>me as we unfold the story um so but the<br>first exercise I'd like you to do is I<br>want you to think personally for<br>yourself what do you think counts as<br>leadership so in the role in which you<br>currently<br>occupy what does that look like it's<br>going to give you a few minutes to think<br>about that and then a chance to do it<br>and a way to think about this is I'm<br>going to give you something that many<br>organizations aren't prepared to give<br>you which is I'm going to give you an<br>extra<br>resource uh and that person is going to<br>only do the parts of your role that you<br>currently count as<br>leadership and so you're going to have a<br>chance to work with the person next to<br>you and you are going to give them their<br>first<br>briefing about what it is that you<br>currently do that you count as<br>leadership I'm going to give you about 5<br>minutes to have that conversation<br>so going to give you 30 seconds 60<br>seconds page<br>one successor exercise when you think<br>about your own role currently what are<br>the bits you count as the leadership<br>work so chance to<br>think so I'll give you a minute or so to<br>do<br>that so want you to pair up at your<br>tables or if you're groups of three just<br>want and I want you to have the<br>conversation with one another around the<br>briefing them around what leadership is<br>now your role is the person who is<br>listening to this is I want you to be<br>one of two things I want you to be<br>suspicious so you've been around long<br>enough to know that when somebody's<br>going to delegate some stuff to you<br>they're going to get rid of some stuff<br>that they'd rather not do so if you get<br>if if they have a conversation with you<br>and you're not convinced the thing<br>they're trying to pass on has anything<br>to do with leadership at all I want you<br>to have that conversation so I want you<br>to be suspicious actually I'm I'm not<br>convinced so you know help me help me<br>understand why you think this work<br>you've asking me to do actually counts<br>as leadership second I want you to be<br>Earnest so I want you you really want to<br>do a good job at this so um I said the<br>number one thing is Inspire and motivate<br>so the leadership industry's got a lot<br>of weaser words so um I want you to what<br>does that look like in everyday cloth so<br>I want you to nod and smile and say<br>that's fantastic so I'm inspiring and<br>motivating so what is it that I actually<br>do in this role that's inspiring and<br>motivating if I was videoing it what<br>would it look like what am I actually<br>doing so 5 minutes to tease out together<br>and at the end of it I'm going to pick<br>up some of the answers what are you<br>confident at the end of the conversation<br>has survived so what survived the<br>conversation long enough to say we're<br>prepared to count this as<br>leadership okay what I'm asking you to<br>do okay I got the easy job asking the<br>questions you got five minutes have a<br>crack<br>I'm not sure if it needs a ring mic or<br>not but just I'm out of Interest what<br>are some of the things that survive the<br>conversation so what are what are the<br>things you left saying yep we're pretty<br>we're pretty comfortable that this<br>council's leadership what sort of things<br>we<br>got developing successes great<br>definitely didn't need a microphone<br>thank you developing successes<br>yep role model been a role model yep saw<br>that in lots of<br>lists explaining the why not just the<br>what and explaining the why not just the<br>what and how very good demonstrating the<br>cause is bigger than the possible<br>consequences so demonstrating that the<br>cause is bigger than the possible<br>consequences yeah yep so by cause you<br>mean whatever it is that we believe that<br>you're in<br>service to take take the blows if they<br>come our way it's bigger than us nice<br>thank you other things that<br>survived understanding connections<br>understanding connections no<br>relationships environment relationships<br>environment people and processes y<br>culture culture okay so you've all got<br>your own sort of list and you've<br>probably set in leadership exercises all<br>over the country doing similar types of<br>things so let's let's do some more with<br>that so I want you to squint with your<br>eyes you ever played the game 20<br>questions you got to guess what's in my<br>head uh you got 20 questions to do it<br>there's two two versions of this this<br>game so the first the first one of the<br>what's the normally the first question<br>that you<br>ask yeah is it animal mineral vegetable<br>okay you're of the technology generation<br>nobody plays these games anymore right<br>um so you've got to guess what's on my<br>head is an animal mineral vegetable why<br>do we ask that question<br>first yeah so we wanted to know what's<br>the essential nature of the thing that's<br>in my head I want you to got 30 seconds<br>with the person next to you when you<br>squint with your eyes behind your<br>answers what are you assuming is the<br>fundamental nature of this thing we're<br>calling leadership now it's not going to<br>be animal mineral or vegetable many of<br>you think you work for vegetables um the<br>the qu what's what's the essential<br>nature of this thing called leadership<br>what's its Essence 30 seconds hardest<br>question I ask you all night this a<br>philosophic question what's the<br>essential nature of this thing you've<br>so I want you to and I want someone just<br>give me one of their answers Vision<br>Vision so what what I want you to do<br>with your answer I want you to put it to<br>this test so every time there is vision<br>would you say leadership is<br>present so for for for me for this to<br>survive the test it's you need to be<br>able to say so people have to say or<br>communication or um being inspirational<br>so so every time somebody's been<br>influenced is leadership present yes or<br>no<br>if every time somebody has Vision so<br>take your answer and apply the test if<br>every time it was there would you say<br>yep leadership counts and if it wasn't<br>there you'd say it was absent so um 10<br>test so what I'm going to what I'm going<br>to do is I'm going to start with a<br>couple to define something that's<br>sometimes useful to describe what it's<br>not so I'm going to give you two things<br>I don't think it is first thing I'm<br>going to say it's not is the<br>characteristics of an<br>individual so the first thing when when<br>you ask the question is leadership<br>present yes or no the first question<br>most people answer in their head is the<br>who question so who in the situation has<br>a certain type of characteristics that<br>I'm prepared to call leadership now that<br>that list might vary a little but<br>effectively the essential nature<br>question for most people the answer to<br>that question is it's a certain type of<br>characteristics that certain types of<br>individuals uh employ now is it an<br>interesting conversation absolutely you<br>know if Mom and Dad didn't give it to<br>you a stuffed or you know is he hope for<br>you yet these these questions have<br>occupied the leadership domain for a<br>number of years and there's some<br>interesting stuff in the space I'm just<br>for me I'm just going to roll it out for<br>tonight and say I don't think it's the<br>most important conversation to be having<br>in the leadership<br>space second question who's the leader<br>so why do you<br>asked who's the<br>boss so the other thing I want to rule<br>out and is a common Association in the<br>leadership space is that we think when<br>we're having the conversation around<br>leadership we think we're having the<br>conversation around what is it that<br>now we use both often in conversation<br>and most people don't even notice when<br>we've changed fundamentally the frame of<br>reference um so I'm when I'm weighing in<br>on this I'm not prepared to count<br>leadership as the characteristics of an<br>individual and I'm not suggesting it's<br>just another way of saying what is it<br>that people in charge do what I'm going<br>to suggest to you is a way of thinking<br>about leadership is to suggest that<br>leadership fundamentally is a<br>contribution and it's a certain type of<br>contribution and it's competes with<br>other contributions that people look for<br>in organizations in<br>particular and so the contributions that<br>I think it competes with and the I don't<br>want to get too lost in the language<br>around it but the first contribution<br>it's up against is a professional<br>contribution and a professional<br>contribution when you've got your<br>professional head on and you're making<br>your professional contribution the thing<br>that's top of most in your mind is how<br>do I do my craft to the best of my<br>ability whether it's Finance whether<br>it's Computing whether it's HR whatever<br>it would need to be how do I be the best<br>at the craft for me it's primarily<br>leadership development so when I've got<br>my professional head on what I want to<br>be is the best at that the power base<br>for it comes from your expertise and<br>from your experience I judge my success<br>as a professional by the complexity of<br>the problems people are prepared to pay<br>me to help them<br>solve so if you when I worked in a<br>Professional Services firm um in in<br>Sydney yeah you basically knew if your<br>colleagues were involving your lots of<br>projects you were doing okay and if you<br>weren't getting a lot you know so the<br>busier you were the better you were<br>getting so how do you add value with<br>your professional hat you keep up to<br>date with and create Innovative practice<br>and you you handle the to hard basket is<br>that an important contribution yes<br>absolutely I think often we when we say<br>leadership often we mean this excellence<br>in the craft leadership and when people<br>say Richie mcco was a leader I think<br>mostly what they're saying is he was one<br>of the best we've ever<br>seen um so our way of thinking about<br>leadership again I'm not prepared I was<br>being particularly finicky tonight I'm<br>not prepared to count it we've already<br>got good language for<br>that you take somebody who's good at<br>their craft and you put them in charge<br>of other people who are doing the craft<br>what normally<br>happens typically you use lose if it's a<br>salesperson you lose your best<br>salesperson and if you're lucky you get<br>an average person in charge supervisor<br>team leader whatever the languages you<br>this it's a different contribution doing<br>so it's no longer just about excellence<br>in the craft when you are put in charge<br>of others so this is where the authority<br>thing is relevant when you are put in<br>charge of others what's the contribution<br>heart the success yep so one of the big<br>transitions is no longer about your<br>individual success but other success<br>yep so I'm going to suest the<br>contribution that we often call<br>management two arguments I have on this<br>one one it's primarily primarily about<br>getting consistent results how do you<br>ensure day in day out week in week out<br>month and month out the rag tag Bunch<br>that currently calls itself your<br>organization delivers on the Promises<br>you've be making to your<br>stakeholders more provocatively I'm<br>going to suggest most of the stuff<br>that's written in the leadership space<br>if you don't instead of if you don't<br>like consistent results effectively the<br>argument what is it you want from people<br>in charge is that how do you get high<br>performance if you Google anything or<br>you get your LinkedIn feed and it says<br>10 tips for leadership really what it's<br>going to be saying is what do people in<br>charge need to do in order to get high<br>performance out of the<br>system and again I already think we've<br>got a good word for that we call it<br>management um I'm not trying to diminish<br>it when I say that I grew up in my early<br>in my Consulting career where the phone<br>stopped ringing for management<br>development and people started asking<br>for leadership development and it was<br>great all you needed to do was change<br>the title and add a<br>zero okay over that transition nothing<br>fund mentally shifted in what was being<br>developed or what was being paid<br>attention to managers became leaders<br>executive teams became leadership teams<br>supervisors became team leaders the only<br>thing that changed was the language we<br>didn't change a fundamental reference<br>point around what is the contribution<br>that's expected now I'm not diminishing<br>management at all I think I understand<br>why organizations pay a lot of attention<br>to it if you get high performance out of<br>the system there's 40% performance<br>Improvement on the table<br>and we know without a scar of Doubt<br>actually what it takes to do that so if<br>you provide a clear sense of this is<br>what success looks like and this is the<br>standard of performance people will<br>perform better if you staff them with<br>the right people and you let left hand<br>know what right hand's doing you will<br>get significant performance improvements<br>when people appear to be hitting you<br>said we're going to be hitting North and<br>they appear to be hitting West you sit<br>down with them and you have a<br>conversation that says this isn't<br>working and most of the time what you<br>doing and this is your experience of<br>most days you have an intent about how<br>you're going to spend your day and it's<br>frustrated by the first phone call<br>Hallway conversation or email and<br>suddenly what you thought you were going<br>to do is no longer what you're actually<br>going to be doing because somebody's<br>called and sick the customer's<br>complained or something else has gone<br>Bell up and you're spending the rest of<br>the day making sure you can get things<br>back on track because if we can<br>consistently deliver the results we'll<br>get a higher performance coming out of<br>it really important contribution when<br>the people in the church who come up and<br>say great leadership what they're<br>telling me is I'm they feel confident<br>that I'm doing this job<br>okay and as having some Authority um as<br>a cheer it's important I exercise that<br>Authority wisely so I'm saying this is<br>incredibly valuable and I'm also saying<br>in my mind has nothing to do with<br>leadership so in my mind excellence in<br>your<br>craft carrying responsibility wisely in<br>terms of the authority that you might<br>have and getting hyp performance out of<br>the system are great contributions but<br>we already have a language for them so<br>if leadership is neither of those things<br>left and I'm going to argue that the<br>contribution that I think counts as<br>leadership is any contribution you're<br>making where you are disrupting things<br>today in the hope that the future will<br>be<br>better that is a contribution that can<br>be made at any level irrespective of<br>your personal character istics<br>irrespective of your title we are<br>initiating conversations and actions<br>that are saying actually the way we're<br>doing it now if we continue to keep<br>doing it this way is going to mean in<br>the future we're going to have a problem<br>I can see a better way of being able to<br>do<br>this so for me this distinction between<br>leadership and management which is often<br>done is best understood as the<br>difference between um delivering<br>business as usual and disrupting things<br>today so that the future will be<br>successful<br>uh I think and I don't disag I think the<br>leadership development industry my<br>industry in particular has focused on<br>the inputs and we lost the story about<br>the<br>outcome the reason we pay attention to<br>Martin Luther King is not because he was<br>a great orator and he's great at telling<br>stories around the vision the reason we<br>bother to talk about him at all was he<br>was at the Forefront of significant<br>change when it came to civil rights on<br>it's my industry that made it about<br>personal<br>characteristics and so this commitment<br>to Shared Vision critical the um<br>aligning stakeholders critical why do we<br>need to inspire and motivate I get that<br>I do a lot of work in operations<br>environments if people are doing work<br>that's not inherently motivating in its<br>own right sometimes to get consistent<br>results you got to do other things to do<br>that um but I think the inspiring and<br>motivate doesn't necessarily count in<br>that case cuz really what it's doing is<br>it's inspiring and motivating in the<br>service of consistent delivery and<br>performance it's not a bad thing just<br>doesn't count as leadership for<br>me so in my church the only thing I'm<br>prepared to count on leadership I think<br>the way we've been doing churches and<br>fundamentally setting this up for the<br>future anything I'm going to do that<br>disrupts the way we do that and the hope<br>that our future will be better is the<br>only thing I'm going to put in my ledger<br>around I'll take the feedback it's nice<br>to have but doesn't count for me and if<br>I was been particular finicky I'd say<br>the only change that counts are the ones<br>that you exercise outside your area of<br>control uh and the more senior you get<br>in the organization it's almost<br>impossible to make any change in the<br>system without it affecting your peers<br>and most of your experiences will be the<br>first reaction you get from pees and<br>I'll thank you very much for raising<br>that we appreciate<br>it<br>so that's my argument in a box in one<br>sense is that um if you like a gentle<br>story so for those of you that feeling a<br>sense of loss around the management<br>space just retitle this a story of the<br>many faces of<br>leadership okay so and maybe we just<br>it's more helpful because leadership is<br>one of those words that's been<br>associated with everything that's good<br>and right in the world so if you'd like<br>if you prefer that story then there is<br>professional leadership there's high<br>performance leadership and there's<br>change leadership um but I just think<br>get in the habit of recognizing which<br>conversation you're in and what's the<br>contribution that you're<br>bringing so my first point is when you<br>want to accelerate your leadership<br>impact I think it's really helpful to be<br>clear what are we actually talking<br>about and I think the individual<br>question which I want to give you a<br>chance to think about is are you<br>deploying yourself across those<br>contributions in the right<br>proportion so some of you will be<br>spending too much time on the tools<br>doing the work to high standards when<br>really what's expected of you is to be<br>creating the conditions so others can<br>thrive<br>perform some of you will be spending a<br>lot of time creating the conditions for<br>others that can be Thrive but are not<br>disrupting things today in the hope that<br>will the future will be better and so<br>you mortgaging the future for the sake<br>of today's<br>performance so the practical application<br>question which I want to give you a<br>chance to look at is I I want you to um<br>the math goes like this by the<br>way what percentage of time are you<br>currently spending in the professional<br>strand what percentage of time are you<br>currently spending in the managerial St<br>strand what percentage of time are you<br>currently spending in the leadership<br>strand now the only way to hold this in<br>my opinion is just by the Top<br>Line what I mean by that is pay<br>attention to the outcome what percentage<br>of your time is personally doing work to<br>a high standard what percentage of your<br>time is currently getting high<br>performance out of a group and what<br>percentage of your time is currently<br>disrupting things today in the hope that<br>the future will be<br>better what's it<br>being in your opinion what doeses it<br>need to be moving forward so two sets of<br>numbers so this is on page<br>three and have a conversation at your<br>table so when you've done the numbers<br>it's a good way to take it for a test<br>drive so<br>um what makes sense about what I'm<br>saying where do you disagree with where<br>are you going yeah but um so have that<br>conversation and then have the personal<br>conversation are you deploying yourself<br>across those contributions in the way<br>that you think's in the best interest of<br>the long-term future of your<br>organization so so have both of those<br>conversations and then we'll pick them<br>there so in terms of reactions so things<br>but anything you want to any taking it<br>for a test drive any clarifications you<br>want or things you want to take issue<br>with or<br>yep so the question is how do you<br>disrupt without it having a result on<br>the business and I think the challenges<br>affecting the performance of the<br>business I think one of the reasons<br>these sit nicely on a chart side by side<br>they don't sit nicely in practice um<br>because the other thing that<br>if I do a slight digression in one sense<br>the primary metric used in most large<br>organizations for leadership<br>Effectiveness is<br>what engagement<br>scores um so performance and engagement<br>so typically the two outcomes we looking<br>for now I would argue engagement scores<br>are a measure of how do you get high<br>performance out of the system and in<br>every conversation that I have when<br>people say oh our engagement scores are<br>down last last year performance scores<br>wouldn't it so performance and<br>engagement yep so okay yep sorry me of<br>management would be performance wouldn't<br>it yes it is would be leadership so I'm<br>arguing engagement stool<br>management and the and the my rale for<br>that when people get poor engagement<br>schools you know the most common reason<br>offered we've just come through a period<br>of significant<br>change okay and so intuitively what I<br>think we understand in one sense is that<br>these two things do not sit nicely one<br>by one in some cases because you have<br>power doesn't mean it's easier to bring<br>about change so one of the fallacies we<br>have is if only I was a CEO then it<br>would be much easier to make things<br>happen around<br>here um one of the there's a funny<br>relationship between power and the<br>ability to make change happens you know<br>the joke at General Electric was when<br>the chairman asked for a cup of coffee<br>somebody bought a coffee plantation in<br>Brazil okay so what power gives you is<br>an amplification effect in the system uh<br>but in ways that are sometimes unhelpful<br>so when people transition into senior<br>one of the first things they learned to<br>do is to be is to to think out loud much<br>less<br>often um so there's some resources that<br>come with power but sometimes just<br>because the person most senior said it's<br>going to be this way it's already<br>automatically harder for it to<br>happen so I think the challenge is<br>actually one of the one of the core<br>questions and I think every person at<br>every level wrestles with us are we<br>doing the right amount of change or and<br>if you poll you always going to get a<br>50/50 response some of you some of the<br>group are going to be saying we're doing<br>way too much change if I could do a<br>Scotty accent from Star Trek I'd be you<br>know he he'd be saying we can't hold<br>this together it's all going to break<br>apart and then you're going to have<br>another half saying we're changing<br>slower than our external envir<br>environment we're not even going to be a<br>business in 5 years time if we if we<br>slow this up and in the end so from CEO<br>down um when you go and pull your group<br>you're going to get a 50-50 response and<br>you're going to have to wrestle with<br>that question<br>am I optimizing the contribution between<br>delivering as much performance as I can<br>today up against disrupting it so that<br>the future can be better if I could give<br>you the percentage that did that in the<br>the algorithm that would help that I'd<br>make millions I just think that's the<br>core question you're actually having to<br>wrestle with and fundamentally you<br>understand that the reaction to both of<br>those things is different and I think<br>the reason most people defaults are not<br>doing enough of the change piece is that<br>actually the people who authorize you<br>your staff and you actually don't really<br>want<br>it two points from<br>this uh concept the first is that I<br>think that people are naturally inclined<br>in themselves to one of those three<br>functions right so there's natural<br>crafts people who have to make<br>themselves do the other stuff natural<br>managers and natural steers<br>disruptors so um the point I took was<br>that if I'm one of those three<br>I need to consciously actually practice<br>the other two so that's one point the<br>other point was um they all hate each<br>other they<br>can you work in<br>health I do quite a bit of work in<br>health you know so this this debate<br>between kind of clinical um clinical<br>leadership service management and um and<br>change you know it's a conversation<br>that's played out of those things I hate<br>the wrong resist each other well well so<br>need to Value the others contribution if<br>if you can't bring it yourself actually<br>recognizing it's a legitimate<br>contribution not one that's designed<br>just to frustrate your own um I spend a<br>lot of time with people in the middle of<br>very large organizations and when it<br>comes to change I think one of the<br>things you have to accept when you're in<br>the middle of a large organization is<br>that every person more senior than you<br>is balancing a broader range of<br>stakeholders than you<br>are every person more senior than you is<br>balancing a broader range of<br>stakeholders than you are and so when<br>when you when they make decisions where<br>you go oh they're so stupid so I was<br>making the comment you think you work<br>for vegetables in one sense typically<br>it's a very<br>uncharitable um assessment I've worked<br>with many people where that's been the<br>case and actually often it's a very<br>careful and clever tradeoff between<br>competing stakeholder needs many of whom<br>are invisible to<br>you so a communication problem you're<br>not being informed with this so<br>potentially but sometimes you know<br>you're in position where sometimes<br>you're actually not in a position where<br>you can say yeah so I I guess I'm also<br>largely in the favor of having<br>interpretation of events that cause you<br>the least amount of upset okay and if<br>you're going to assume that your senior<br>people are stupid um all that's going to<br>cause you is upset um if you live with<br>the possibility that they balancing a<br>broader range of stakeholders than you<br>um you'll live longer and your life<br>won't be quite so<br>miserable um so so absolutely I'm are<br>people more naturally predisposed to<br>some some of these than the others I<br>suspect it's true across all sort of<br>capabilities is it possible to get<br>better at these with intention yes I<br>think it is otherwise I wouldn't do what<br>I do um but yep it's a good<br>point other questions um if performance<br>and engagement are an indicator of<br>management yep what then are a good<br>indicator for effective leadership it's<br>a great question so if I'm saying<br>performance and engagement of the<br>management characteristic<br>if you hold tightly the definition<br>around positive change what would be the<br>closest<br>metric I'm arguing Innovation how to how<br>much percent improv engag yeah so the<br>big shift if you look at globally what<br>what are things shifting in terms of the<br>leadership space what you there's a big<br>push around sort of social<br>entrepreneurship entrepreneurship and<br>large organizations there's a Confluence<br>in the so you go back 10 years there was<br>talent talent development and leadership<br>development got merged<br>and so so leadership development became<br>executive development essentially<br>because we were asking the question what<br>do you need to be successful at<br>different levels in the organization um<br>so that happened like 10 years ago um<br>what we seem to see now I think is<br>emerging around sort of innovation and<br>creativity and Entrepreneurship and<br>Leadership and I think that's possibly<br>more hopeful if we're playing what's the<br>core conversation so um if I was<br>weighing in on a metric side I'd be more<br>inclined to Innovation metrics what<br>percentage of your current businesses of<br>new ideas in the last couple of years um<br>what's the rate of improvement and<br>change that's that's sitting within your<br>organization what experiments are you<br>trying this year that you are setting<br>you up for future success there'll be<br>y other good questions thank you other<br>questions<br>clarifications<br>com POS change<br>leers you get<br>is motivated me to do that change yeah<br>positive for him necessarily not<br>necessarily positive for others they are<br>going to basically face this natural<br>human condition of<br>a society L society that is going to be<br>reent to a change because they Master<br>what they are doing and they are happy<br>with it Y how we get them from that kind<br>of happiness to better happiness as you<br>envision it so for those who couldn't<br>hear me said it's going great um and he<br>he was asking the question when you were<br>doing the change piece the first<br>reaction you often get in the change<br>space is is reticence rather than we're<br>happy to hear this what can you do to<br>help that and I think that from a<br>development point of view that's at the<br>heart of why things like how do you get<br>commitment to Shar Vision so by the way<br>Shear vision isn't I have shared my<br>vision with you and therefore we've had<br>we have a shared Vision so that's the<br>most common translation in organizations<br>so so you know anything you do that<br>exercises involves people in the<br>conversations and decisions around the<br>future is going to increase commitment<br>to it um the conversations around the<br>reason inspiring and motivating matters<br>is because exactly of that case when<br>people are offered with change what they<br>see most ear what they see early large<br>in their face is<br>loss and the thing that's been most<br>influential my thinking space people<br>don't resist change they resist<br>loss if there's no loss in the change<br>people will embrace it you people are<br>changing all the<br>time what what people are resisting is<br>not a sense it's not because they're<br>stuck in their ways or you know most of<br>our assumptions around resistance are<br>uncharitable what you when you recognize<br>that what people are resisting is loss<br>in one Sense part of your role is to<br>help them say you're right we're giving<br>up a certain now for an uncertain future<br>but the risk of doing nothing is<br>greater than not doing something now so<br>um I'm not I'm not really giving you the<br>answers around the how in that regards Z<br>I think most of the leadership industry<br>is doing the work to try and do that but<br>it's it is the right question and this<br>is where I think these two things don't<br>sit nicely you know getting high<br>performance out of a group requires<br>consistency a degree of predictability<br>um and Clarity when you're working in<br>the change space the Dynamics are and do<br>feel different ums yeah the Dynamics are<br>different yeah and and and and learning<br>to be comfortable across those becomes<br>really important<br>yeah so I want to give the question back<br>so I think so how many of you have got a<br>shift on the personal contribution<br>that's required so how many the numbers<br>between how you're deploying yourself<br>now to the Future are different so how<br>many need to spend more time<br>professionally how many people need to<br>spend less time<br>professionally yeah how many need to<br>spend more time<br>managerially see how many need to spend<br>less time managerially yep how many need<br>to spend more time in the leadership<br>space<br>how many to spend less time in the<br>leadership<br>space okay well all those are possible<br>um I would argue if you've got a number<br>in the leadership column that's greater<br>than 30 um there would have to be a<br>massive misalignment between the<br>external environment and your current<br>organization you know if you're spending<br>you if 10% of your um 40 hour week is 4<br>hours you're saying you're spending 12<br>hours a week disrupting things in the<br>hope that the future would be better you<br>need a pretty good reason in my opinion<br>to be doing that so while I work in the<br>leadership development industry I don't<br>think that number needs to be big I<br>thought the question was going to come<br>at you know there are some people who<br>just want to change thing for the sake<br>of it you know do you count that as<br>leadership I'm I'm not<br>convinced your my feeling was that that<br>leadership one needs to be pretty low so<br>you you know you pick your battles<br>because otherwise You' just be ignored<br>or just worked around if you're always<br>trying to you know change everything and<br>yeah you need to sort of work with the<br>system but just pick particular things<br>you're going to nail and get absolutely<br>it's one of many possible contributions<br>so the question I think that in terms of<br>accelerating your development the first<br>question I want to put before you was to<br>say are you deploying yourself in the<br>Right Mix now the the hands are a common<br>proportions and so a couple of things to<br>help you think about that so I want you<br>to start thinking tonight what personal<br>changes and how you spend your time and<br>energy will help you make that<br>shift um couple of things I want to say<br>is that time management and delegation<br>will probably be helpful but<br>insufficient and I intend this is good<br>news not bad news<br>so what I'm suggesting in one sense is<br>um currently there are things falling<br>off your plate okay all of you have got<br>things on your list that you've been<br>meaning to get to some of those things<br>have been there for six months at<br>least um I think the time has long since<br>past where it's possible to get to<br>everything that is expected of you and I<br>again I intend that as good news what I<br>intend in that is that I think there are<br>genuinely some people who think that if<br>only they were better stronger and<br>faster that'd be able to get to all of<br>this I'm wanting to say that game is not<br>that is not an option for you stop<br>playing the game if I was better<br>stronger faster I'd be getting to all of<br>this that I think the only game you have<br>to choose you you don't choose whether<br>stuff falls off your plate stuff is<br>always going to fall off you only choose<br>what falls off and if you've given<br>different percentage numbers you are<br>telling me that you think the choices<br>you are making about what stays on the<br>plate and what falls off the plate you<br>don't don't believe are serving you and<br>your organization I'm asking you to make<br>different choices I'm not asking you to<br>get to more things I'm saying you're<br>making different choices about what<br>falls<br>off now again I've got the easy job<br>asking the question is easy what<br>implicitly what you recognize is when<br>you stop doing some stuff you<br>disappointing other<br>people and a quote I quite like and I<br>try to onas sizee is that leadership is<br>the art of disappointing people's<br>expectations at a rate that they can<br>handle<br>um and essentially how that was<br>originally intended is that if you the<br>expectations of people in power is for<br>clarity degree of predictability in<br>order fundamentally when you get<br>involved in the change thing you have to<br>manage those expectations because<br>actually what you're going to do is<br>disrupt things a little but I also<br>accept that when you're making changes<br>one of the things is people who used to<br>get a whole lot of time and attention<br>from you in a particular way are<br>probably not going to now if you make<br>these<br>changes um now there's one some<br>principles I found helpful in one sense<br>if you need to spend less time<br>professionally you will argue that the<br>reason you can't is that you don't have<br>enough<br>time I'm going to argue it's mostly<br>about where you get your kicks it's all<br>about prioritization in that sense right<br>so it is prioritize it in a sense what<br>I'm trying to do is put that across the<br>contribution level rather than at the<br>task level y<br>um I know that the thing that would make<br>the biggest difference to my my ability<br>to create change in my industry or in<br>the country is not to be doing stuff<br>like this<br>um so there's a limit to how much I can<br>how many rooms I can get in front of and<br>the number of people that I can get in<br>front of and I've known this for years<br>um if I was going to do this I'd either<br>scale up my business so it's not just me<br>and my wife and we'd have other<br>associates doing it or I'd be writing<br>and Publishing and getting out to a<br>wider audience so I've known this for<br>for at least two years I've made no I've<br>made no progress on it and the the<br>reason I'm telling you that it's because<br>um I've got a really important group of<br>people here and so you know uh I've read<br>a couple of Articles before I come but<br>when you've been 25 years in an industry<br>you're going to read an article and and<br>maybe I'll get one anecdote I didn't<br>have before um if I didn't read another<br>thing in the leadership space for the<br>next 12 months not being rude you<br>wouldn't<br>notice um the reason I don't do that is<br>because I get my kicks having that<br>conversation if I was to have a<br>conversation around what Catalyst 4<br>should look like in 5 years time I can<br>spend an hour doing that I feel more<br>confused at the end than when I started<br>so i' prefer not to put myself through<br>that I'd rather do stuff I enjoy and<br>think good<br>at um so have a strong conversation with<br>yourself learn to have kicks about<br>things that aren't just in your prefer<br>professional area of<br>expertise in the management space my<br>slightly provocative statement is some<br>of the things you do don't deserve your<br>high<br>standards I do a lot of work in large<br>organizations typically I can guarantee<br>you some of you are finessing spending<br>two hours finessing a report that<br>closely um um most professionals who<br>move into managerial positions um have a<br>per perfectionist tendency they Le to<br>learn to kick perfectionism this not<br>this is not a stand for low standards<br>it's a stand for requisite standard um<br>and people who have a perfectionist<br>tendency don't realize the threshold of<br>added value and what you mean by that if<br>you you spend that extra two hours<br>getting more detail into the budget it<br>doesn't increase Clarity around whether<br>it's going to work or not you've just<br>added detail<br>complexity um if you spend too much time<br>finessing a report that frankly people<br>don't read that case the worst example<br>I've had of this someone spent one and a<br>half days presenting 70 page board<br>reports to to find out by accident they<br>only reach page five and Page<br>70 um they now spend half a day<br>producing a five b report a five-page<br>report and everybody's happier okay but<br>in large organizations that happens a<br>lot so what are some of the things<br>you're doing don't deserve your high<br>standards others of you that there's a a<br>smattering of hands sort of going up<br>around needing spend more time then<br>there is more time going into the<br>discipline of not just doing the work<br>but um what does success look like in 12<br>months<br>time um how do I coordinate things more<br>effectively and on the leadership space<br>I guess my most common observation<br>people tell me when I get the staff<br>member on board when the system is up to<br>date when we do this then I'll get to<br>the change piece if I see that person in<br>6 months time they're still telling me<br>the same story um when you go into a<br>dark room you don't take chase the<br>darkness<br>out uh you turn on the light and what<br>I'm as an analogy what I'm suggesting is<br>that in many cases you have to put the<br>change stuff in first and let that Force<br>some of the other choices around the um<br>professional in the managerial so<br>principles I found helpful don't help me<br>with the practice but some principles<br>I'll give you a couple of minutes<br>hopefully you're doing this as I've been<br>talking specifically what changes would<br>you need to make to deploy yourself<br>across these contributions in a better<br>proportion so give you a minute to do<br>that chance to talk to the person next<br>to you if that's helpful<br>so the first part of accelerating your<br>leadership development suggesting one<br>let's be clearer around what it is<br>suggesting it's a contribution primarily<br>we're disrupting things today in the<br>hope that making the future better and<br>that you it's competing with other<br>contributions to accelerate your<br>development make sure you deploy<br>yourself in the right<br>proportions the other three questions I<br>found most helpful which to accelerate<br>leadership growth um if you if you<br>buying my central argument that it's<br>primarily around change then I'm saying<br>the three questions if you have a really<br>clear answer to will accelerate your<br>development are these the first one is<br>what is your signature organizational<br>change so if leadership is primarily<br>around change the first question you<br>need to have a good quality answer to Is<br>what's the change I'm in service of and<br>I like that sense of if I if I'm making<br>a change on behalf of the whole that I<br>think's going to set up our future<br>future if I could only do one thing in<br>the next 12<br>months and I was to put my signature<br>next to it and say this is evidence of<br>the leadership difference that I've<br>made what's the one change that would<br>make the biggest<br>difference out of Interest how many<br>people could answer that question<br>now okay so I'm arguing for every hand<br>that's not<br>up uh there's a leadership development<br>impact now for some of you you might be<br>sitting here thinking of all the that<br>I'm doing which is the one and for other<br>you you're probably sitting you're<br>thinking I'm doing a lot of stuff I'm<br>just not sure how much of that is<br>disrupting things for the day and making<br>sure the future will be better either<br>way there's some value in having some<br>time to think about that<br>question second question which is the<br>the primary question in the leadership<br>development industry it's an important<br>question it's what intentional change am<br>I making with regards to my own<br>behavior and again I'd say minimum of<br>one maximum of two<br>so by Behavior I mean changes in the way<br>in which you're doing your work is it<br>the capacity to be able to talk<br>positively about the future is it having<br>a broader range of strategies for being<br>able to influence others is it being<br>able to have some of the difficult<br>conversations that are required uh in<br>the service of change is it the capacity<br>to be able to listen listen behind what<br>people are saying and recognize the loss<br>and be able to motivate and Inspire<br>towards it what is it about the way in<br>which you do your work that if you<br>deliberately change would make either<br>your life easier or you more<br>effective again how many of you have got<br>one or two behaviors tattooed on your<br>eyelids when you close your eyes you<br>know what it is and you've been<br>intentional about being different at it<br>how many you've got one or two okay<br>slightly more again I'm going to argue<br>if you can't answer that question you're<br>getting no additional development over<br>and above what you would have got by<br>chance okay how many of you would say um<br>experience is the best teacher<br>y so exp it's only partially<br>true um so a couple of things I think um<br>most people are having experience like<br>drinking from a fire hydrant okay so<br>we're having a lot of experience but<br>there's just not a lot of<br>swallowing uh so one of the ways<br>experience becomes the best teacher is<br>if you build some space into the pace of<br>your life so taking some time out for<br>some reflection to actually process what<br>you're learning from your experience<br>becomes critical um second is getting<br>feedback on the work that you are doing<br>but I think you amplify your development<br>with through those experiences you've<br>got top of mind at least one shift in<br>the way in which you do your own<br>practice that you think is going to be<br>making more effective and you're<br>actively trying to do some things around<br>that that's the second question the<br>third question which is in the service<br>of both of those that you can be quite<br>you can specifically tell me um what<br>actions you are planning to take and can<br>I use a slightly crude expression will<br>ends I did both by the way um so what<br>actions are you taking where you're a<br>little bit scared and a little bit<br>excited by it that's that's the speed of<br>Development question you will have<br>accelerated your development at the rate<br>that's necessary when you are doing<br>either in service of the organizational<br>change or in service of the personal<br>change something that feels a little bit<br>outside your comfort zone<br>something that feels not quite like your<br>default um something that feels a little<br>bit unnatural in the first<br>instance and in my experience the people<br>who have good quality answers to those<br>three questions accelerate their<br>leadership growth more than people who<br>don't and so what I want to give you a<br>chance to do is to have a chance to<br>think about each of those questions um<br>first one I'm not going to add too much<br>too my sense I don't have a whiteboard<br>but um Vin diagram um your signature<br>organizational change should be part<br>strategic Insight part what do I think's<br>in the best service of the organization<br>interest overall and part personal<br>interest personal passion where where<br>are you personally excited got a bug<br>bear want to make a difference in your<br>signature organizational change should<br>sit in The Sweet Spot between those two<br>things will make a big difference to the<br>organization and You' have personally<br>got an interest and passion in it if<br>you're working in that sweet<br>spot uh it's a lot easy to do lot easier<br>to do the<br>work and so for a couple of minutes with<br>the person next to you I don't W need a<br>fully form formed answer to this but<br>what might it<br>be if you could only make one change in<br>the organization so if I was to take a<br>photo of the organization now and then<br>come back in 12 months take another<br>photo of it what would you point to to<br>tell me it was different<br>and you would say I was part of making<br>that happen I put my shoulder to the<br>wheel and because of my contribution I<br>think we've really shifted the dial on<br>this what's the one thing in the<br>organization that you think would make<br>the biggest difference so couple minutes<br>you so not an easy question to answer so<br>I don't suggest I think that's an easy<br>question to answer but I think if you<br>want to accelerate your leadership<br>development it's the primary question<br>um uh in the leadership development<br>industry when people ask you how are you<br>going to demonstrate that you've made a<br>difference what most people look for is<br>time one and time two<br>360s okay what it gives you is a sense<br>of the behavior change but I don't know<br>if you have noticed but most most people<br>aren't that interested are you more<br>effective at having um difficult<br>conversations what they're interested in<br>is um how's the world different as a<br>result uh and I think they have every<br>right to be interested in that the the<br>sense is what are you what are you<br>planning to do intending to do where um<br>you're disrupting things today in the<br>hope that the future would be better so<br>get as focused on that as you can the<br>second question is one that happens a<br>lot which um we do a lot of work on a<br>couple of things which may be familiar<br>to to many of you but how when you're<br>answering the question what's the one or<br>two behaviors I'm going to pay attention<br>to how many of you are going through<br>your mind of all the things I think I<br>suck at which ones will I<br>pick so one of the common errors in<br>making choices about behavior is that we<br>tend to do that so and my industry is<br>largely responsible for this so we've<br>we're uncomfortable saying weakness so<br>we've called them areas for<br>development as a result now when people<br>say the word development they think<br>we're just using politically correct<br>language for weakness<br>um the research case is pretty clear all<br>of us have weaknesses and on the whole<br>they don't<br>matter what drives high performance in<br>particular is not the absence of<br>weakness but the presence of distinctive<br>strength what drives high performance in<br>an organization is not the absence of<br>weakness but the presence of distinctive<br>strengths and so the nuanced argument<br>when it comes to thinking about<br>development is in some cases if you<br>doing some things that are so<br>distracting that getting in the way of<br>the other things that you would do it<br>would be good to pay attention to it uh<br>and in the literature they call this a<br>fatal flaw which is the first time the<br>industry has been more dire than the<br>average population um and you know<br>people who have fatal flaws because the<br>Fatal floor walks on the door before<br>they do okay so I was working with a<br>group in a Professional Services firm<br>they were the internal Finance part of<br>it uh and we're doing a team development<br>session and they we were doing it in<br>house and the phone rang and it was it<br>was a someone they said I use my<br>brother's name Rodney and said get<br>Rodney how's it going and everybody in<br>the group says oh gosh she's going to be<br>on the phone for 30<br>minutes so I would argue if I was Rodney<br>and I was coaching Rodney he's got a<br>fatal floor I've got a picture of Rodney<br>that people when people walk down the<br>corridor they make sure they don't make<br>eye contact because they don't want to<br>you know it takes a long time to deliver<br>a short message so if you're if you've<br>got something that you do poorly<br>inconsistently that it doesn't matter<br>what else you do that's what you're<br>going to be known for you need to go<br>it and not many people have them so<br>that's the good<br>news so therefore the second place to do<br>your development thinking is things that<br>you are already good at but not<br>distinctive<br>at so um this what they call the good to<br>great shift so not by the title of the<br>book but things that you are good at but<br>not distinctive at distinctive the<br>threshold is better than 80% of the<br>people in your<br>industry so if you make a good to great<br>shift you've already got an aptitude and<br>an interest in it it's just you're<br>probably not doing it consistently<br>enough or some stakeholder groups are<br>seeing it and others aren't i. you you<br>might be great at it with staff but soon<br>as you go to a peer environment you lose<br>your voice um but those kind of shifts<br>are slightly more subtle but more<br>important in terms of getting the impact<br>and the interesting thing in the<br>research you really in terms of<br>distinctive strengths the number that<br>you need in<br>total about<br>five so it's not a large<br>number and it's really about producing<br>distinctiveness so when you are thinking<br>about the area that you're looking to<br>develop don't you don't have to be sick<br>to get<br>better now I coach one of the management<br>team in the All Blacks they don't invest<br>a whole lot of time in coaching their<br>development because they've got sucky<br>players they invest in them because if<br>you're going to keep your Edge you don't<br>have to be sick to get better you want<br>to do the constant Improvement piece so<br>it's the the same sort of personal part<br>there so what I want you to think about<br>have the conversation with the person<br>next to you if you could only do one<br>thing focus on one<br>Behavior over the next six months that<br>you are good at but not great at<br>and that if you improved you believe<br>would make you more effective at this<br>thing we're calling leadership producing<br>disrupting things today to make the<br>future better what might that<br>be okay so have a crack what would that<br>like the thing I want you to do the the<br>other part that's critical to this and<br>this sounds crazy so I've been running a<br>program for 12 years in the for the<br>Midland dhbs and every year it goes like<br>this so about this time of year they<br>send out a 360 so they get feedback from<br>managers staff and peers um they go out<br>around September October uh closer to<br>November um they sit down in January<br>with a trained organizational<br>psychologist who works through the<br>report they have a conversation around<br>it they agree the one or two behaviors<br>that are going to make the biggest<br>difference um two weeks after that they<br>get sent back a one pager that<br>summarizes the um conversation and the<br>one or two behaviors that they have and<br>then I see them the month ler in<br>February um in a workshop there's 20<br>people in the room every time this<br>happens uh middle of day one I come back<br>to these questions and I pick somebody<br>at random and I say on the basis of all<br>that stuff you're doing what were the<br>one or two things that you agreed um and<br>the most common<br>answer can't<br>remember okay so all that investment of<br>time and energy and you've just had an<br>interesting conversation yourself my my<br>experience has been that if I saw you in<br>a week's time or in two weeks time and I<br>ask you the question what's the one or<br>two thing most of you would have already<br>forgotten as a result I'm going to argue<br>again you're getting no additional<br>growth over and above what you would<br>have got by<br>chance so the interesting discipline<br>it's a very simple discipline in one<br>sense one of the things you're going to<br>have to do is over the short term how<br>are you going to keep this Focus top of<br>Mind there aren't Endless Options for<br>this you know what works for you but if<br>you don't remind yourself repeatedly in<br>the early stages I can guarantee this<br>none of you are sitting here saying<br>thank goodness for this program or this<br>tonight because I've been wondering what<br>to do with my Fridays um you got other<br>stuff that's going to squeeze out your<br>attention so if you're going to<br>accelerate your development you're going<br>to have to keep it top of mind so 10<br>seconds with the person next to you what<br>will you do over the next month to make<br>one of the things you notice on the<br>handout there how many people have heard<br>conversations so few of you when it<br>comes to behavior change in 25 years of<br>doing development if there's only one<br>thing that I could do that takes the<br>shortest amount of time and has the<br>biggest impact it would be having what's<br>called feed forward conversations okay<br>so the international data on this is the<br>same as the data that I've collected in<br>The Last 5 Years so the health program<br>that I just talked about um um people<br>pick one or two behaviors so you might<br>have be more effective at dealing with<br>conflict um they'll work on it over the<br>six to 12 over the 6 months then we send<br>a short survey to everybody who<br>completed the 360 and we just ask them<br>two questions one for each behavior in<br>the last 6 months has Peter's ability to<br>deal effectively with conflict minus<br>three it's a h of a lot worse zero quite<br>frankly we've seen no change plus three<br>hell of a lot better okay by the way<br>time and time two leadership surveys I<br>don't believe at all effective<br>descriptors of change and the reason I<br>say that is I don't believe anybody sits<br>across 80 questions going last time I<br>rated you a three I think you've made an<br>improvement this year therefore I'm<br>giving you a four it's not a snapshot of<br>change it's an interesting snapshot of<br>where you are at the moment so if you're<br>using time one and time two for<br>measuring leadership Behavior change I'm<br>arguing it's probably not doing that for<br>you I think a more targeted way to do it<br>is to ask the question directly on the<br>few things we've been expecting to see<br>changing are we or not um now the people<br>who do feed forward coaching or have<br>feed forward conversations 80 to 90% of<br>the people you survey will say a plus<br>two or a plus<br>three the people who don't 50% would say<br>they've seen no change 10% would say<br>it's got worse and the rest might see<br>some improvements typically or one or<br>two now I don't know anything that takes<br>less than 15 minutes a month and<br>guarantees that 80% of the people around<br>you will say they see a significant<br>Improvement in that behavior okay I<br>don't know anything so if there's only<br>one thing you could do this is it now a<br>feed forward conversation goes like this<br>people and every month you front up and<br>you have the same<br>conversation you start by asking them<br>front would you prepared to help me with<br>my development I saying sure say look<br>I'm going to come and ask you the same<br>question every month so I'm going to<br>work on being more effective how I deal<br>with conflict and here's why I'm paying<br>attention to that and each month I'm<br>just going to ask you as you know I'm<br>working on um how I deal with conflict<br>what ideas do you have around how I<br>might do that<br>better um and you nod and you smile if<br>you don't quite understand what they're<br>saying you say could you help me<br>understand what that would look like and<br>you say thank you um and you have two<br>other conversations then you pick one of<br>those things and you do it differently<br>for that month then you front up in<br>month two and then you have exactly the<br>same conversation so the conversation<br>you want to have have you noticed any<br>difference um that's a feedback<br>conversation a feed forward conversation<br>is as you know I'm working on dealing<br>with conflict um what other ideas do you<br>have now the magic number on this<br>appears to be between three and four so<br>if you do it more times than that seems<br>unnecessary if you do less times than<br>that it's probably not that helpful but<br>for conversation typically 5 minutes is<br>probably taking too long if you pick<br>three people ask them that question<br>every month I can guarantee you in 6<br>months time the people around you will<br>say we've seen a significant change in<br>this<br>Behavior so when we do this feedback<br>survey thing we we involved the people<br>who were involved in the feed for<br>conversation plus everybody else who did<br>the original part that's how we know<br>that all people say we've noticed a<br>difference we're not just getting<br>involvement bias which I'd be happy with<br>anyway um so one thing to think about<br>for the area that you've picked so the<br>cynic of me is saying you may not have<br>had any M it's just because you're<br>talking about it with someone else that<br>you're saying yes but wouldn't you want<br>to bank<br>that so<br>so think you're on a different night so<br>all you're doing is a mindset change of<br>that person so so I think sometimes so<br>absolutely so the saying well I<br>personally don't care so if that bothers<br>you then work then work harder um taking<br>it I'm thinking really you know you know<br>I mean there might be some change<br>obviously you might take in but for<br>others it's just in that other person<br>making Mar and say I need to do that<br>andly it's just for them so so true I<br>think so don't don't disagree the other<br>side of that I how often are you hung on<br>a series of expectations that are<br>actually<br>unfounded and I've had some people where<br>say when when people have said I don't<br>think you're very good at this and<br>you've chosen to work on it and you've<br>asked them four times and not once have<br>they given you a substantive point of<br>view after a while they realize actually<br>I don't think there's anything in<br>this and what if at best what you've got<br>is less noise in the system yeah yeah no<br>it's good I like cynical points of view<br>so it's good to good to challenge you<br>shouldn't take everything I say as<br>gospel so um so it's the it's the<br>shortest thing I know that makes the<br>biggest difference the key thing is have<br>conversations so pick three people first<br>prize if you're dealing with conflict<br>pick three people you're having conflict<br>with that would be first prize it's a<br>great example where first prize probably<br>might feel a little bit uncomfortable<br>okay but if another words if you pick<br>being more effective at coaching staff<br>or being more strategic then actually<br>what you pick is the people and whose<br>eyes that performance matters most so if<br>it was coaching staff who would you<br>pick three staff if it was being more<br>strategic in the organization who would<br>you<br>pick probably people more senior in the<br>organization if you're going to be more<br>effective at influencing across the<br>organization who are you going to be<br>picking<br>your peers so pick the people in whose<br>eyes that performance matters most and<br>get them involved in the conversations<br>around how you might improve<br>it if first prize feels too scary second<br>prize is somebody that you admire the<br>way in which they do and you'd be happy<br>to get their ideas from so who do you<br>think is a rockstar in the way in which<br>they do this and just get their<br>perspective so before you leave pick<br>three names that you're going to go on<br>approach and say would you be prepared<br>to help me with my development<br>if you only do that one thing I can<br>guarantee you accelerate your<br>development the<br>most closing comment is around the third<br>question around take action outside your<br>comfort zone from a personal development<br>point of<br>view I think it's more often true that<br>is is that anxiety is how it feels to<br>grow uh and courage is just a nice way<br>of saying that so you know courage<br>properly defined is feeling anxious and<br>still taking the<br>action and so what we mean by being<br>couraged is is choosing to put yourself<br>in situations where you feel a little<br>bit uncomfortable so if I was dealing<br>with difficult conversations I might<br>stay in a conversation and ask a<br>question uh one more question than I<br>normally would hoping that I might stay<br>in the conversation longer than I did<br>before um and doing so would feel<br>uncomfortable for me but it's part of a<br>deliberate intention to be able to<br>practice doing that<br>so when it comes to your your behavior<br>change I'm arguing it's probably going<br>to come associated with a little bit<br>it'll be a good to great shift there<br>will still be a sense of a little bit of<br>discomfort sitting around it that's how<br>you know you're accelerating it at a<br>rate that's going to be useful to<br>you when it comes to the organizational<br>change component of that one of the<br>things I want to leave you with is this<br>notion that um in order to make change<br>in the system it's going to require you<br>to take action outside your formal<br>author Authority and your informal<br>influence what I mean by both of those<br>things is that there are things that are<br>expected of you because you hold a<br>role there are additional things that<br>you might be able to do because you have<br>a good quality relationship with the<br>individual and if you are genuinely<br>going to make real change in an<br>organization you're going to have to<br>take action that's just outside both of<br>those things the person who designed<br>this called that walking the Razor<br>Edge one of the things that will happen<br>is that when you take action just<br>outside your formal and informal formal<br>Authority and informal influence what<br>smack so if you are making genuine<br>change in the system and you operate<br>just outside that the expected response<br>will be get a smack the system will bite<br>back and if it doesn't you're probably<br>not making a real enough change what I<br>want you to recognize is that the isn't<br>necessarily evidence that you're doing a<br>bad job it's just evidence of the system<br>biting back and I think one of the the<br>myths in the leadership space has been<br>is that if you tell a positive story if<br>you're empathetic and ask good questions<br>and you have the right people around the<br>table everybody will hold hands and join<br>you running into this glorious future um<br>there are some changes that have that<br>Dynamic to it uh but I think on the<br>whole more people's experience is the<br>first responses are typically not quite<br>as glorious and a little bit getting<br>smack um and I think what people will<br>want to tell you is it's because your<br>personal<br>style now it's useful to reflect on that<br>but I'm largely going to Su it's largely<br>a system response um not a personal<br>response so get<br>comfortable getting<br>smacked um the thing is if you work way<br>out here so if you operate too far<br>beyond your formal and informal<br>Authority it's going to be easier to<br>take you out than it is address the<br>change and that's the part that you're<br>scared<br>about um and it's true if you are too<br>disruptive well beyond your formal<br>Authority and your informal influence<br>it's going to be easier to take you out<br>than address the problem you're trying<br>to raise so the the key in this is it's<br>a it's a really tricky judgment call is<br>to recognize that the experience of<br>making that organizational change on the<br>inside will always feel like you're<br>wrong um what I'm encouraging you to do<br>is to more consistently put yourself in<br>that sit situation in the service of the<br>change that you're looking to<br>make and what I'm asking you to do from<br>an intentional development point of view<br>is we're encouraging you to do is to be<br>deliberate around where am I going to<br>choose to show up a little bit<br>differently um either what's the risk<br>I'm going to take in terms of the<br>behavior or what's the risk I'm going to<br>take in the organization in order to<br>make things<br>different so that's flavor really um in<br>terms of accelerating your development<br>get a good balance between your<br>professional management and Leadership<br>contributions if leadership's primarily<br>the contribution around change have<br>really good answer to those three<br>questions what's the signature<br>organizational change what's the<br>intentional change in my own behavior<br>and what actions am I taking outside my<br>comfort zone</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
