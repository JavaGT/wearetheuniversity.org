following TVNZ's 'What Next ?'<br>http://neverstop.ac.nz/whatnext</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Gilda kyaaa pour what next made a big<br>effort to engage its audience online<br>this is the future of live TV I hope<br>it's something like this and not reality<br>TV or something like The Bachelor where<br>we have a live very ceremony or some<br>other show where we see people being<br>sent home or taken away crying in a limo<br>it's something that encourages people to<br>engage imaginatively and intellectually<br>with the issues of the day I think is a<br>great thing the show created a<br>particular narrative around the future<br>how important is storytelling and the<br>way that we we come to view the future<br>it's important to know that whoever is<br>telling the story controls the narrative<br>so if we're discussing our country our<br>society the political spectrum the<br>future who is controlling the narrative<br>or who is joining in with the narrative<br>is really essential but at the same time<br>the more talk the more narratives the<br>more conflicting narratives going on the<br>better in many ways I think in this<br>capture we need more discordant<br>narrative we need people stepping up to<br>disagree with each other backing out<br>what they think not resorting to abuse<br>or vitriol but bringing their different<br>points of view because that's when the<br>story becomes really rich and<br>multifaceted it is that kind of<br>complexity and a story does that turn<br>some people off you know are we at risk<br>of having people switch off if we're if<br>we're telling them it's complicated and<br>multifaceted clearly a lot of people do<br>think that complexity is a bad thing I'm<br>reminded of us every time I watch<br>international health hunters which<br>follows a really really strict now to<br>form and after every break here of a<br>massive recap as to what has already<br>happened in case you've forgotten during<br>the commercials or I guess in case<br>you're just tuning in and I think that<br>maybe receive wisdom that this is how<br>information needs to be delivered to the<br>populous you know told us told to us<br>reinforced to repeated made as simple as<br>possible and it's<br>quite possibly that that's how some<br>people prefer to receive information<br>everything is black and white you're<br>either for again however we don't really<br>live in a black and white world we live<br>in a world of great complexity and while<br>it's true that a lot of people don't<br>want to negotiate with complexity it<br>doesn't let us off the hook<br>in terms of provoking discussion and<br>trying to change people's mind<br>we'll just suggest a range of different<br>options because otherwise do we have<br>independent will do we live in a<br>democracy they live in the kind of<br>society New Zealand that we want I mean<br>one great thing about New Zealand I<br>think is that we've been small and<br>nimble as a society we've been able to<br>affect social change when other larger<br>older or traditional countries could not<br>so Maori MPs when we're getting the vote<br>social welfare system we've been able to<br>really enact social change here and you<br>don't do that by presenting<br>black-and-white pictures to the popular<br>now one of the stories that was was told<br>as part of poke what next was around the<br>importance of technology and the fact<br>that you know artificial intelligence<br>and robots are coming that you know and<br>they're going to be stealing people's<br>jobs people will talk about accountants<br>and lawyers you know those types of jobs<br>disappearing but yet that does this mean<br>that you know what's the what's the role<br>of creativity and and say an arts degree<br>in the future I think it's funny when<br>it's always accountants and lawyers who<br>mentioned sort of disliked profession<br>yeah I don't could do without it but<br>yeah can we do without doctors where<br>it's something else beyond a skill set<br>it's also about intuition and empathy<br>and gut feelings you know playing on<br>instinct yeah or just a wild thought<br>that's you know part of the glory of a<br>great doctor and a great medical system<br>in an arts degree which has the death of<br>which has been predicted since I was at<br>high school and the 70s<br>why are you doing that do you want to be<br>a teacher that's the only possible use<br>for it of course I think it's ridiculous<br>to think that any sort of degree<br>training that teaches you to be a<br>critical thinker an excellent writer and<br>to be imaginative well to be<br>imaginatively and selectively curious as<br>we talked about before that intellectual<br>and imaginative curiosity is essential<br>to our humanity when people say where<br>can an arts degree lead you I say it can<br>lead you anywhere you want to go what's<br>crucial that you develop on route<br>through University are critical<br>faculties and an enormous curiosity<br>about how things work and the the skills<br>to read to disseminate information to<br>understand to articulate that's what's<br>really important about a university it's<br>about being better readers writers<br>thinkers dreamers experimenters who<br>understand how creativity involves</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
