style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>well thank you all for coming tonight<br>it is many of you will have come to our<br>previous lecture series to the Alamos<br>and Center and and as many of you will<br>know that Alan Wilson Center is no more<br>at the end of 2015 we didn't receive<br>funding so the University of Otago was<br>very kind to provide funding for the<br>Allan Wilson at Otago research theme so<br>my name is Lisa Madison Smith I'm<br>professor of biological anthropology<br>here in Otago and I'm the director of<br>the Ellen Wilson at Otago theme which<br>basically provides funding for us to<br>continue the outreach activities and the<br>public lectures that the Allan Wilson<br>Center developed and were so so popular<br>for many many years so so hopefully<br>that's how most of you have heard about<br>the the talk tonight but also we have<br>been busy attending the GSA or genetic<br>Society of Australasia conference here<br>for the last few days so some of you may<br>also be here because you were attending<br>the conference so welcome everybody it<br>is my great pleasure to welcome our<br>speaker tonight professor Tom Gilbert<br>who is based at the Natural History<br>Museum of Denmark and Tom really is one<br>of the top people internationally in the<br>world of ancient DNA he did both his<br>undergraduate and graduate work at<br>Oxford and now runs his lab out of the<br>Museum in Copenhagen at the University<br>and we were very lucky to be able to get<br>him to come out for the conference and<br>to give two public lectures one in<br>Auckland and many of you may have heard<br>the Kim Hill interview on Saturday<br>morning and then tonight's talk so<br>you're not here to listen to me but<br>you're here to listen to Tom so I will<br>just ask you to to join me in welcoming<br>professor Tom Gilbert to touch not got<br>me my dog in May<br>thank you and thanks for coming I wasn't<br>actually originally anticipating having<br>people staying from the conference on to<br>this but I guess it's so cold outside<br>that you can't leave so thanks for<br>staying on there is a small overlap as<br>you can see from the type of what I'm<br>going to talk about is dogs maze and not<br>actually myself I'd love to talk about<br>myself as do we all but about other<br>humans and in particular in particular<br>what I what I was going to talk about is<br>how we've evolved in the world of<br>ancient DNA and in fact in DNA genetics<br>in general to be able to do genome<br>sequencing on a very large scale and how<br>this is actually allowing us to see<br>things that we can't see normally so I<br>am based in Denmark I am NOT Danish not<br>yet I am British I promised I will not<br>talk about the Lions so I will not talk<br>about the Lions but thanks for letting<br>them win once and what I will talk about<br>is a guess which one give me some help<br>well good how do I full screen is again<br>it's full screen up there are you going<br>all this attention okay so what I<br>actually work on people often ask me<br>what do I work on what do my group work<br>on because to be honest it's a very very<br>schizophrenic mix of things and I had to<br>actually think about this in preparation<br>for this and and at it is sort of cool<br>what I'm interested in is basically<br>biodiversity this is a nice picture I<br>stole from the internet and I like this<br>picture because I was searching for<br>biodiversity and I like the fact it's<br>shown as a tree and the reason why I<br>like it shown as a tree is because the<br>nice thing that trees is you can take<br>the chainsaw to them and shape them and<br>this is actually what I'm very<br>interested in right now how do we shape<br>biodiversity and have we shaped it in<br>the past and there's really two ways<br>we've shaped it that are of interest to<br>my group right now one of them is we've<br>got rid of biodiversity so here we have<br>a a an Irish elk see the great now<br>extinct elk in Europe they're very<br>common across<br>Europe until about ten twelve thousand<br>years going to died out and we were<br>probably to blame and on the other<br>example of course as the other mower<br>that a New Zealanders managed to get rid<br>of and and it's a very interesting topic<br>how we get rid of these things and<br>there's a lot of research going on in<br>fact a lot of research right here is on<br>this in the context of birds now the<br>other way we shape biodiversity is of<br>course we actually build it people tend<br>to forget that we don't just get rid of<br>it but we do create it we're very very<br>good at creating diversity so what we<br>have here is maize just different<br>versions of maize all domesticated from<br>the same original stock and we've shaped<br>it in many different ways and and so<br>really what we look at is how did we get<br>rid of diversity and how do we build it<br>up again and I'm going to focus on this<br>latter thing domestication how have we<br>domesticated things you're going to<br>apologize to those that were here<br>earlier but we have to go through some<br>of the basics again domestication<br>research has been very very central to a<br>lot of people studying the past we're<br>very interested in questions such as<br>where did we domesticate things so we<br>know for example that maize as a<br>modified form of a plant called teosinte<br>but where did we first domesticate it<br>when did we do it you know it's<br>domestication a fairly recent thing is<br>in an ancient thing what might this tell<br>us about the people doing it how many<br>times did we domesticate things and I<br>don't just mean how many independent<br>species but I mean how hard is it to<br>domesticate something so if you consider<br>the wolf is investigating a wolf into a<br>dog difficult but it would only happen<br>once<br>if you've read clan of the cave there<br>you will find out that they did it once<br>or not but if on the other hand was it<br>actually really straightforward it seems<br>kind of intuitive that you see a cute<br>little baby wolf when you bring it home<br>and you might eat most of them but you<br>might keep a few of them and you might<br>domesticate it and there's a lot of<br>contrary controversy over this we really<br>don't know how frequently domesticated<br>things were domesticated once we<br>domesticated them how did we distribute<br>it around the planet how did we move<br>things this is a really interesting<br>question because again it tells you<br>about human and their behavior in the<br>past and the other thing that that<br>people really like to argue about is how<br>did we improve it so once we've got the<br>original form how did we change it into<br>the form it is today<br>how difficult was that and how do we<br>study that well the standard way of<br>studying this is simply to look at<br>modern variations so you can for example<br>this what if I do this yeah so you can<br>for example simply look at the modern<br>version of the crop or the animal you<br>can look at various wild versions of it<br>so this is tear synthase and end points<br>account now the wild ancestor of maize<br>this is some kind of in-between thing<br>and you can just look at it and there's<br>some very obvious things that stick out<br>for example modern-day maize has got<br>lots of kernels on makes it more<br>enjoyable to eat and so just you know<br>visual observations can tell you a lot<br>about the present but what it can't tell<br>you about is what happened originally to<br>get us there now the way to start<br>looking at that is archeology so for<br>example people have been very having a<br>lot of arguments about domestication of<br>dogs from wolves and I said we don't<br>really know when it happened but there's<br>arguments saying it was quite recent<br>argument saying it was a long time ago<br>one of the reasons for arguing it was<br>very ancient is because of<br>archaeological evidence so people have<br>found skeletons of animals in Belgium<br>about 32,000 years ago at the gray caves<br>which is some very famous painted<br>hunter-gatherer caves and when they've<br>been looking at these they will see that<br>some of them for example at very<br>wolf-like like the ones on your left and<br>then the ones on the right look a bit<br>different and if you know your dogs<br>you'll know that one of the things that<br>happens in domestication is the face<br>gets short and the snout gets shortened<br>and when they find these thirty thousand<br>year old skulls with the shortened snout<br>they say well we think this means it's<br>probably a dog there for domestication<br>is that old now once<br>DNA was sort of you know known about and<br>people start to work with it and they<br>could sequence it we could use DNA to<br>add to this now of course without DNA<br>you're constrained to things you can see<br>the beauty of DNA is it tells you what's<br>going on elsewhere in the process so the<br>idea is you can simply extract DNA from<br>the world relative of what you want of<br>the of the modern domesticate and you<br>can sequence bits of the DNA and you can<br>look for the differences between them<br>and you can find the genetic basis of<br>the differences and people are doing<br>this all the time on dogs and wolves and<br>for example with dogs one gene that we<br>know is very different is one called Amy<br>to be and it just allows dogs to eat a<br>more starch<br>diet something that wolves wouldn't<br>normally be eating so again we can spot<br>that and and this really took off in the<br>mid-2000s when we went to what's called<br>the genomic revolution so a series of<br>machines were built and they were sold<br>in the mid-2000s that made sequencing an<br>awful lot easier and allowed us to start<br>sequencing whole genomes so instead of<br>looking at a gene for one particular<br>trait we could look at the total<br>difference and this is the era of<br>genomics and genomics is actually very<br>hard to do to to define what it is but<br>we tend to view it as sequencing DNA<br>from the whole way across the genome<br>getting as much information as you can<br>now I'm going to take a brief detour<br>here and tell you how I got into<br>genomics my background is actually in<br>fish behavior when I was an<br>undergraduate at Oxford the only thing I<br>wanted to do was work with fish and in<br>particular amphibious fish the kind of<br>fish that would go out of water and then<br>go back in again and I actually get a<br>series of in retrospect very cruel<br>experiments where I would take fish that<br>are not at all adapted to being out of<br>water put them out of water and sit on a<br>stepladder and watch what they did and<br>it was a it was interesting but I didn't<br>stay there for long and I then moved in<br>my PhD into doing genetic work and you<br>know I was doing standard genetics as it<br>was done 15 years ago with the technique<br>of PCR we would analyze very short<br>fragments of the genome and it was very<br>informative but we then had this<br>genomics revolution and I thought to<br>myself I need to get in on this genomics<br>as did many others and so and it's a<br>true story in about 2008 I was in Madrid<br>in this square having a coffee and I was<br>doing what many scientists find<br>themselves doing much of the time if not<br>all the time these days I was sitting<br>thinking how do I write a grant to get<br>me a load of money to allow me to keep<br>being fed to hire people to not get<br>fired it's a very positive world<br>academia and as I was sitting there<br>thinking you know the problem is you<br>need to find a new idea and it's quite<br>hard to find new ideas that somebody<br>will fund and I was sitting there and I<br>was thinking what can I do what can I do<br>and true story as I was sitting there a<br>pigeon crapped on me<br>just sitting there splat on the head<br>and at first I was like are my guard<br>pigeons and then I was like pigeons<br>because what I realized was my rage and<br>hatred for the pigeon meant it might be<br>a perfect study system because what we<br>biologists have a lot of problems doing<br>is getting permission to sample things<br>you know it's really hard to get a bit<br>of Kiwi in sequence it and I think it<br>everyone hates pigeons how hard can it<br>be<br>and they're actually very very<br>interesting animal pigeons um that<br>they're found everywhere you can do a<br>project allows you to travel as I said<br>nobody cares if you sample them you can<br>get permission to do it fairly easily<br>they've got a long history of<br>association with humans I love this<br>because it shows a pigeon crapping on<br>somebody else in the past and it shows<br>Jesus had a disciple to catch the crap<br>being put on his head is is you know<br>it's a very wonderful animal the pigeon<br>and it's actually got a very very long<br>history with humans it was probably the<br>first domestic bird maybe six seven<br>thousand years ago and if you like<br>domestication that makes it interesting<br>nobody else works on it because<br>everybody hates it which means that<br>nobody's going to be fighting with you<br>many good things going it's also<br>fundamental actually to Darwin's thought<br>process for you know the evolution<br>Darwin was a pigeon fancier he would<br>look at pigeon breeds and he would say<br>well you know they kind of all derived<br>from one pigeon these things are<br>changing or under things change<br>naturally and in fact part of his<br>thoughts that gave rise to the Origin of<br>Species came from pigeons these are<br>actually illustrations from one of his<br>books and in fact pigeons they're hated<br>today but they didn't used to be so a<br>very little-known anecdote is that when<br>Darwin had written the Origin of Species<br>his publisher John Murray was trying to<br>basically get people to decide if they'd<br>like to give feedback peer review<br>basically and one of the guys he sent<br>the Origin of Species to as a guy could<br>L win and L win read it and he wrote<br>back and said basically you should drop<br>all this evolution rubbish just focus on<br>the pigeons because everybody loves<br>pigeons everyone should love pigeons so<br>you know they've actually got a long<br>distinguished history and evolution<br>biology and I wanted to get in on the<br>action and again part of the reason why<br>back then I wanted to do it with<br>genomics was the genomics is quite hot<br>now it was very very very hot back in<br>two thousand eight nine ten and<br>fact if you look at the history of<br>genomics what you will find is that<br>until about 2013 if you sequence the<br>genome of anything it didn't matter how<br>pathetic your story was what organism it<br>was you would get a paper in Nature and<br>Science getting a paper in Nature and<br>Science I guess is like beating the<br>British lines at every single rugby<br>match it's like the top thing you can do<br>it's really really very important for<br>academics and so that was a good reason<br>to do this unfortunately things didn't<br>stay that way so by 2014 genomes were<br>not quite as cool but they were still<br>being published in journals like pmf<br>very very good journal by the end of<br>2014 they were being published in PLoS<br>ONE<br>which is an OK journal and again I want<br>to take a slight detour to tell you what<br>happens at the very very beginning of<br>2015 a genome came out in a journal<br>called at de novo which is mainly famous<br>for having published only one paper ever<br>and this again is a true story<br>they published the Big Foot genome in de<br>novo somebody actually true you can look<br>it up if you don't believe me somebody<br>actually sequence what they claim with<br>Bigfoot's genome and they published it<br>in a journal they actually created to<br>publish it because they said it was<br>unfair the world was not accepting their<br>story in any normal genome and what I<br>really love about this focus very<br>carefully on Bigfoot right it's<br>remarkable when you think about it<br>Bigfoot is modeled on Clint Eastwood but<br>so it's amazing making and it's out<br>there you can find it so there you go so<br>genomics was very very cool it's kind of<br>fun now but there is a serious point<br>here actually genomics become actually<br>it's gone from a very rare tool where<br>you could get a paper in Nature and<br>Science that was so hard to do it so a<br>very common tool that people make up<br>stuff about genomics and this basically<br>means today actually we can pick any<br>system no matter how unloved or crazy we<br>can get DNA from the organism we can<br>sequence it we can get papers out of it<br>and we can really study things in ways<br>we can never study before so again so I<br>was working on pigeons I basically found<br>myself a pigeon this is what's called a<br>Danish tumblr it's a very noble pigeon<br>from Denmark I slaughtered my noble<br>pigeon they sequence the genome and I<br>actually used it for my first genomic<br>study and basically I did something<br>slightly obscure but I looked at a trait<br>the head crust if you look at those<br>pigeons you'll see they've all got<br>feathers sticking up on the back of<br>their head except the black one which<br>has no head left at all it's remarkable<br>headless pigeon and what we did by<br>looking at the genomes of a lot of<br>pigeons was we found the genetic reason<br>for why they had a head crest and it's<br>really not that exciting but the point<br>for me was I was learning wow this stuff<br>actually works we can do stuff and this<br>thing gets me back to what I'm talking<br>about now domestication and and if we<br>think about what I was saying before<br>that we can use morphology to study it<br>we can use archaeology to study it we<br>can use modern DNA to study it this is<br>very useful it will tell us things like<br>how do things differ today how is a wolf<br>and a dog different today it will tell<br>us about when things first appeared like<br>when do we first see the snout reduction<br>in a dog but it has to be a very obvious<br>trait if you care about for example when<br>could dogs first eat starchy foods you<br>can't look at a skeleton to find that<br>and in fact if you look at many of the<br>questions that I said were like central<br>to understand an explication they're<br>actually hard to study based upon modern<br>variation so if you want to know where<br>things came from when how many times how<br>they were moved around the world and you<br>compare things today you have to assume<br>that the distribution of things today is<br>the same as what it was in the past and<br>for a very very simple example if you<br>were to go out into New Zealand today<br>and start collecting animals you find<br>for example cats rats these things<br>rabbits and you knew nothing else you<br>might think they were native to New<br>Zealand because you find them there but<br>of course by looking in the past you<br>know they were brought - and things of<br>change - change is a very important<br>thing you have to account for and some<br>things you care about for example what<br>was the order of the changes you know<br>what came first did the reduce now come<br>first or the ability to digest starch<br>you can't understand that by looking at<br>the present to do that you have to go<br>into the past each time travel and this<br>is the beauty of ancient DNA this area<br>that I have a background in and that<br>many people have you can use ancient DNA<br>to study the past now ancient DNA is a<br>very popular topic I mean most famous<br>probably for Jurassic Park a story which<br>is about as far away from ancient DNA as<br>you can get<br>what's actually very very relevant for<br>my talk today is that ancient DNA was<br>actually basically created by Alan<br>Wilson the guy that this seminar series<br>is named after and Wilson and Higuchi<br>they were in the u.s. they had the idea<br>in the early 80s that this DNA stuff<br>that we know we can get by blending up<br>mice and frogs and stuff I wonder if it<br>survived is back into the past and maybe<br>had really thought about this that the<br>DNA might be in it so they went to a<br>quagga<br>this is a quagga it's a horse like thing<br>that died not too long ago maybe a<br>hundred years ago they got some skin and<br>they actually managed to extract DNA out<br>of it and this was revolutionary at the<br>time eighty four nobody even thought<br>this was possible they actually made a<br>phylogeny and again for the scientists<br>here got a paper in nature based upon<br>about a hundred bases of sequence and<br>four taxa showing the complete obvious<br>that a clogger is more like a zebra than<br>a cow or a human good old days of nature<br>1984 I think it was so easy but again<br>the point was they showed it could be<br>done and these days ancient DNA is just<br>a classic range of things people work on<br>we love our skeletons we love fossilized<br>plants mummies are great I love this<br>mummy mainly for the moustache this<br>mummy has this mummies called Sylvester<br>he has a name people like his moustache<br>so much and actually even that brown<br>thing that's a fossilized tomb or a semi<br>fossilized poo this the kind of stuff we<br>live off every day<br>nothing gets an ancient DNA person more<br>excited in old poo samples we're very<br>glamorous punch an ancient DNA like<br>every other area of biology has done<br>very well for itself with the advent of<br>the sequencing revolution so we have<br>these new sequences they allow us to do<br>genomics they in fact allow us to what's<br>called paleo genomics you can actually<br>look it up and there's a definition on<br>online I found it's the study of genomes<br>of extinct organisms this is not<br>strictly true because most of my group<br>work on pally genomics I kind of asked<br>them to define it and the rough<br>definition I got was basically it's a<br>definition of genomics where you spend<br>an awful lot of money you're very very<br>surprised by the fact that every time<br>you think you know what's going on<br>you're completely wrong and in fact this<br>is very important thing people give you<br>very old samples they say they're very<br>old you spend a shitload of money on it<br>and then you find out they're only<br>five 50 years old anyway because the<br>psalm has got mixed up it's a very<br>disappointing field but it's also a very<br>exciting field and it's taught us a lot<br>and what I'm now going to do is do I<br>promise to start and talk about what is<br>this telling us about domestication and<br>I'm going to focus mainly on my two<br>favorite systems maize and dogs and<br>wolves and hopefully you'll be able to<br>show how now we can do genomes from this<br>material on a big scale we can just see<br>things that are not otherwise possible<br>so maze mazes domesticated from Cinco<br>teosinte TS entity looks like that it's<br>obviously quite different looking - made<br>some bits of it are recognizable like<br>it's got leaves apart from that though<br>it's quite different and from the modern<br>data just the fact that we can see<br>what's out there today modern genetics<br>we know that it came in central Mexico<br>so you can see this as the region called<br>the Balthus Valley in central Mexico<br>it's a very tropical environment not at<br>all like to Needham and it's a very warm<br>ring as it's warm tropical moist<br>probably was domesticated about 8,000<br>years ago it's a bit controversial by<br>6,000 years ago it had moved to South<br>America and by 4000 years ago to be<br>moved to North America and this was<br>actually a very very fundamental step in<br>mazes evolution because the difference<br>between the American Southwest and the<br>Balthus region is as I said the Balthus<br>region is hot and sticky the American<br>Southwest is much drier it's higher<br>altitude and maize had to be adapted to<br>grow in this very different climate and<br>that is why you can grow maize<br>everywhere today because it had Apted to<br>growing this whole new climate if he had<br>never done that we wouldn't be able to<br>grow everywhere today we wouldn't be<br>able to enjoy conflicts around the world<br>so that's what we know so then where<br>does the ancient DNA come in now there<br>was a guy called Bruce Smith at the<br>Smithsonian who really is the god of<br>plant domestication he's an incredible<br>incredible man he's got a huge knowledge<br>of domestication and more importantly<br>for me an immense large buckets full of<br>ancient maize samples these are pictures<br>of some of its samples on the right<br>there's a basically a modern dried maize<br>cob and as you go to the left you see<br>maize as it looked through time and the<br>very last one there's about five and a<br>half thousand years ago as you can see<br>it's very very different and so what we<br>did is we took this sample and we<br>simply sequence its genome using all<br>these fancy technologies in the hope we<br>could see what didn't these look like<br>genomic ly 5,000 years ago how is it<br>different to the tears Cynthia that it<br>comes from so what has happened in the<br>first three thousand years how is it<br>different to the maze today so you know<br>what did it still have to do and we<br>sequenced it and we did some basic<br>analyses this is what we call a PCA it's<br>basically just a way to visualize<br>genomic data and it shows a purple<br>cluster which is basically Pierce intake<br>it shows a cluster on the right which is<br>modern maze and bang in the middle where<br>it's that real red dot telecon is our<br>ancient sample such fittings between<br>them it shows us a transition thing<br>don't worry too much about that but what<br>was important was I say we could look at<br>the genome and we can look in the genome<br>for genes that we know are very<br>important for maize today and we could<br>basically see do these genes look like<br>the maize version that we have today or<br>the cheerson T version the ancestral<br>thing by five thousand years ago how far<br>along the process had it come and that's<br>what this figure shows we basically see<br>at the bottom things like genes to do<br>with when it flowers genes to do with<br>basically where the leaves are it was<br>already in the maize form so these were<br>traits that people selected on early<br>they obviously wanted to develop it in a<br>certain way things at the top things<br>like the plant height things to do with<br>a glucose metabolism they hadn't really<br>thought about yet and this is telling a<br>straight away that the early farmers<br>were very very concerned about growing<br>what was actually doing as opposed to<br>what they were doing with it and I'm<br>going to come back up to that in a<br>second so once you've got one sample<br>anchored at one time point we can start<br>filling in the gaps through time and so<br>the next two things here on these<br>samples from about 3,000 years ago and<br>about 1500 years ago and we can sequence<br>them and we can do it on a population<br>scale actually and get a lot of it and<br>then we can start to say well if these<br>changes happen first and then these and<br>then these we can just order that<br>domestication and when you do this you<br>actually find some interesting things so<br>one of the earliest things that is<br>selected on therefore the most important<br>things to the early farmers is a trait<br>called shattering shattering is a<br>basically a very fundamental thing that<br>many crops do if you're a mono crop<br>growing baby crops on you seeds<br>you want to spread them forth into the<br>world so they grow into new plants and<br>one way of doing that is to basically<br>bang when your your cob is right and you<br>basically fire the seeds all over the<br>place and they spread all around the<br>place as opposed to falling at your feet<br>that's fantastic if you're a crop and<br>you want to grow new crops it really is<br>a pain in the ass if you're a farmer<br>because the last thing you want to do is<br>get to your field and find all the seeds<br>on the floor because they want to bang<br>overnight you want to stay on the plant<br>and what we can see is that very very<br>clearly at the earliest stages of<br>domestication what the farmers cared<br>about was stopping this behavior they<br>were selecting on plants that did not go<br>bang and send their seeds everywhere<br>this makes a lot of sense later as we<br>move forward then we find adaptation to<br>things like dehydration to different<br>heights so we can see that trying to<br>grow maize in different regions and so<br>all the adaptation is on that so they<br>fix the annoying exploding issue now<br>let's try and grow it elsewhere what was<br>most surprising to us is what comes last<br>only about a thousand years ago do we<br>find genes under selection for things<br>like<br>the maize properties that are<br>lightweight tortillas they kind of make<br>the sticky property of the flour the<br>ability to make popcorn the sweet flavor<br>in sweet corn so this is very recent and<br>this immediately makes you wonder like<br>what the hell were they doing with their<br>maize for 8,000 years like it was in a<br>chair cynthia is not a very enjoyable<br>thing to eat and yet you know it took<br>like 7,000 plus years to finally make<br>this crop we enjoy eating today so very<br>very weird not what we would have<br>expected but it does suggest that<br>initially they just wanted to have<br>something that would grow would give<br>them something and only when they<br>finally cracked ooh that could they<br>start messing around and making it<br>actually enjoyable so the other thing we<br>can do though is actually another quite<br>fundamental question in domestication<br>today people have been very busy<br>sequencing teosinte from all over the<br>place so what this figure shows is in<br>purple and yellow just different regions<br>where you find teosinte the world roads<br>are growing and people have been busy<br>sequencing modern teosinte to try and<br>look at the genetic variation in modern<br>teosinte and this is a very useful<br>resource for ancient DNA people like<br>myself because as maize was domesticated<br>in the terrorcon valley sorry in the the<br>Balthus valley near silicon<br>and as it moved north up this path to<br>get out it would have to go through all<br>this teosinte and this actually sets up<br>a very interesting thing that we can<br>test about domestication so there's two<br>fundamental models to how we domesticate<br>plants we being early farmers in one<br>model you've got a whole lot of this<br>teosinte plant growing around the place<br>one day you have this bright idea that<br>maybe instead of just traveling across<br>the valley to get I think grow it in<br>front of my house and you start growing<br>it locally that's pretty easy start then<br>what happens is maybe you're looking at<br>it growing there and you've got this<br>population in your garden and you think<br>well okay maybe I like this one it was<br>growing bigger or faster or something<br>and you keep it and you replant it the<br>next year right you just you retain the<br>ones you like and then you keep doing<br>this through time and you keep retaining<br>the things that you like and so you're<br>selecting on this population for a<br>particular trait that's one model it's a<br>very straightforward linear process now<br>the other one is actually more complex<br>it requires a much more advanced<br>thoughts process but you start the same<br>way you're growing your tear center in<br>front of you but then maybe you hear<br>about in another valley there's another<br>teosinte growing that maybe has<br>something you like maybe it's prettier<br>or it doesn't shut or it's taller and<br>you think I wonder whether I bring that<br>over and I mix it with my first teosinte<br>so you basically transfer in new genetic<br>material and you keep doing this you<br>keep incorporating more and more<br>variation by crossing things this is no<br>different to how we breed dogs today for<br>example people look at a Labrador and a<br>poodle and gonna put together make<br>Labradoodle<br>the question was that were they doing<br>this five six seven eight thousand years<br>ago in Mexico and the beauty of the fact<br>that we have all this nice teosinte that<br>have been sequence from all over the<br>range means we can look as maize moves<br>through time and location to see is<br>there new genetic material being<br>incorporated from the wild teosinte it<br>passes and we basically see this as the<br>case this second model explains what's<br>going on it's very very clear that the<br>farmers through time were continually<br>bringing in new genetic variation and<br>often from very long distances away from<br>where the samples come so people we're<br>really moving things around crossing<br>them in and doing something that we<br>would view as a very modern practice<br>today back five six seven<br>and years ago now bear in mind at this<br>time there was not even this was pre<br>Aztec it was pre Olmec it was a pre the<br>big civilizations in South America there<br>was never any wheel in South America so<br>space just villages of people but they<br>were doing this very advanced behavior<br>and we can only really see this through<br>the genetic information so a quick<br>summary about means it's had a good<br>eight thousand years of improvement<br>weirdly enough only recently become<br>enjoyable as I would define it very<br>advanced crop improvement behavior going<br>on all view through the DNA so if I want<br>to use my other example now dogs right<br>and dogs again a very very interesting<br>domestic study there's a lot of debate<br>over what's going on here where did we<br>domesticate it some people argue<br>actually it's an East Asian thing<br>especially when the sequence would<br>called the white chromosome others argue<br>that it was a miter saw it was a<br>European thing so very different parts<br>of the world another team led by a guy<br>called Gregor Larsen he's actually<br>started sequencing ancient samples is<br>being very diplomatic and he's saying it<br>was both we had like European ones and<br>Asian ones let me mix them together to<br>be a happy family<br>when was it domesticated I've already<br>mentioned this there's a lot of<br>controversy some argue it's an old<br>things 30,000 years ago when we were<br>hunter-gatherers we would have<br>domesticated the dog and somehow used it<br>for helping hunting or whatever the<br>other school of people say it's a recent<br>thing it's only once we started to build<br>villages and have animals and farms to<br>protect that we would have domesticated<br>so maybe it's only ten twelve thousand<br>years ago this is very very fundamental<br>big split here in opinion how again we<br>study it well the classic way to study<br>it today is very similar to what I<br>described you will study a load of<br>modern dogs you will find yourself a<br>load of modern wolves who are the<br>ancestors and ideally once you've<br>sequenced enough DNA from them you would<br>find one particular wolf for example<br>this one here that looks closer to dogs<br>than any other wolf and if you find this<br>one wolf then which one it is in this<br>one this is point not an Indian wolf but<br>if you find one wolf which is closer to<br>all the other dogs then you might reason<br>well maybe this was the ancestor of dogs<br>because that's why it's close it's the<br>closest looking one and if it was the<br>Indian one then you could say maybe dogs<br>with domesticated in India<br>because that's where we find this modern<br>Indian wolf that looks like a dog<br>the problem is with with with dogs is<br>that actually when you look at wolves<br>today there is no wolf that has ever<br>been identified which looks more like a<br>dog than any other one it looks very<br>much like either people have not looked<br>at enough wolves or the ancestor of dogs<br>has actually gone extinct it was a<br>different thing it wasn't a modern wolf<br>and it doesn't matter how many modern<br>wolves you look at you will never be<br>able to actually identify what's going<br>on so the way we've tried to address<br>this is by simply getting us as many<br>wolves as we can live wolves dead wolves<br>archealogical wolves sequencing them and<br>building a huge reference database of<br>wolves through time through space and<br>then compare it to the dogs and see what<br>we see and when you do this you can<br>build a phylogenetic tree which is<br>basically a gigantic family tree and if<br>you look at this tree what's important<br>is the blue things are all dogs the<br>black things are modern wolves the<br>little turquoise cluster is actually<br>ancient wolves in particular wolves that<br>were about fifteen to thirty forty<br>thousand years ago from Siberia so<br>eastern Siberian extinct wolves and if<br>you flip this and look in detail you<br>find some key things firstly you find<br>there's a lot of wolves that seem to<br>vary I hate to use this word it's the<br>wrong word to use but they're primitive<br>in the phylogeny that they sold they're<br>from North America so in North America<br>we can see is very very important my<br>American colleagues love this I found<br>this by googling the amazing Donald<br>Trump making wolves great again there's<br>not really any relevance for<br>domestication if I had to show this<br>because somebody's put a lot of work<br>into it what we also see though in this<br>basic basal cluster of North American<br>wolves is that's also where our<br>Pleistocene so our ancient twenty thirty<br>thousand year old wolves they cluster<br>nicely with the American ones even<br>though they're not found in the Americas<br>these remains they cluster genetically<br>with them so it suggests again North<br>America was a very important place<br>what's cool about these ones is we think<br>they were hyper carnivorous so we think<br>that the Wolves until about fifteen ten<br>thousand years ago were actually<br>different to the ones today they were<br>like the dire wolves in Game of Thrones<br>they were bigger they specialized on<br>hunting big things like mammoths the<br>kind of last thing you would imagine you<br>would ever want to do mess<br>a much bigger more aggressive thing<br>compared to the tame little wolves you<br>find today and again because we have a<br>huge data set of genetics we can do<br>something very similar to what we did<br>with the maize and looking for is to<br>you're sent a mixed in with it we can<br>look at what dogs and canid species are<br>mixing with each other when you look at<br>North American wolves they've got a lot<br>of Clio T DNA in them that's not<br>surprising clear days live in North<br>America if you put a wolf near a coyote<br>they will eventually share genetic<br>material the polite way of saying have<br>sex if you look at the ones from Siberia<br>from 15 to 30 thousand years ago they've<br>also got Clio T in them it's kind of<br>weird cuz kirti's don't live in Siberia<br>but it probably points to the fact that<br>the Siberian extinct direwolf like<br>things they're not died wolves in the<br>biological sense but they are in the<br>game of throne sense we're probably in<br>the Americas where they met Cleo T's and<br>again as I said this is not really very<br>surprising after watch any dog for a few<br>minutes<br>dogs canids will basically try their<br>luck with anything but this is actually<br>very cool information for domestication<br>for a reason I'd like to explain so if<br>we zoom right in on our six truly<br>ancient wolves we see they cluster into<br>groups you've got this group below the<br>red line which are about 18,000 years or<br>older in fact they're actually twenty<br>five thousand years or older and we've<br>got two above the line which are much<br>younger they are 13,000 years and they<br>are 18,000 years old<br>they've all got Cleo T in them but when<br>we look at how much Cleo T and what else<br>is in there we find that the youngest -<br>from 18,000 years ago and from 12,000<br>13,000 years ago have also got dog<br>inside them now this is extremely<br>exciting for those of us who care about<br>when were dogs domesticated because it<br>goes back to this question of where they<br>domesticated recently 1012 thousand<br>years ago or they domesticated a long<br>time ago in the hunter gatherer area the<br>only way you can get dog inside an<br>eighteen thousand year old wolf is<br>through out a time travel doesn't happen<br>right now as far as I know or through<br>the fact that dogs were around 18,000<br>years ago to have dog Pleistocene dire<br>wolf mixing and therefore give them the<br>DNA so if dogs were doing this 18,000<br>years ago they had to have been<br>domesticated 18,000 years ago we have<br>cave dog we don't have farmer dog<br>and this is actually you can never tell<br>this from modern DNA it really does say<br>that this whole idea that we<br>domesticated dogs when we had villages<br>to protect when we had cattle to herd is<br>not true it must have been in the<br>hunter-gatherer time and then you can<br>basically start to think about well why<br>were we doing it at this time why are we<br>doing it to guard caves or we'll be<br>doing it to help us hunt wooly rhinos or<br>did they basically domesticate<br>themselves and move in with us and I<br>actually personally think it's the<br>latter case so a quick summary of dogs<br>North America is a very important place<br>she said dogs will basically try their<br>luck with anything and domestication is<br>definitely pre farming now what I want<br>to do in the last bit of the talk is<br>move on to another of my favorite things<br>and this will be the human as<br>represented by the famous Australian<br>Russell Crowe I have your most fun you<br>know can we apply this to humans because<br>you know we haven't just shaped things<br>through time in just shaped dogs some<br>shape maize but we've also been shaped<br>ourselves so humans have been famously<br>shaped by the environment we originated<br>in Africa we left East Africa East<br>Africa looks like this today probably<br>didn't then but the point is it was nice<br>and warm there were different things<br>around there and we had to adapt to new<br>climates as we moved this is basically<br>meant to be England but it applies I<br>guess to Dunedin as well you know it's a<br>you know darker weather cold weather<br>this led to a lot of selection on us we<br>had to adapt to and you can compare<br>modern Europeans today and what an<br>Africans today and see the differences<br>and see we have these genetic<br>differences for example Gen Africans<br>have got genes that give them basically<br>darker skin and that protects them from<br>the Sun and so on<br>we have genes that allow us to drink<br>milk which I'll come to in a minute and<br>the point of this though is that it's as<br>with the maize and with the dogs the<br>question is to me at what order did<br>these changes come in which things<br>happen first now in addition to moving<br>we had to adapt to new foods I've<br>already given you maize we didn't eat<br>maize before maize was domesticated<br>we've had to adapt to this much starch<br>in our diet we had to adapt to sugar<br>like again as I'm told the famous<br>Australian dish the pavlova I still<br>never to say that in New Zealand I don't<br>quite quite get it I did find one that I<br>think got a Kiwi on it if you look<br>carefully and again a nice adaptation<br>has been very very fundamental<br>and adaptation happens on a very very<br>long scale it happen you know like in<br>this hundreds of thousands of years it's<br>also very very recent I would argue the<br>All Blacks have adapted to crushing<br>England every time they play rugby with<br>them it's a very recent adaptation now<br>of all the adaptations the one which is<br>probably most important in these recent<br>time is this last one pathogens when we<br>started to settle down in cities or<br>towns at least villages initially we set<br>the conditions for pathogenic epidemics<br>on the scales that way it would never<br>have happened before too many people in<br>too close to space the fact that humans<br>you know didn't have anywhere to store<br>the meat would probably get drunk<br>contain the well you said something<br>nasty nasty pathogen situation and we<br>know that humans have been subjected to<br>very strong pressure from pathogens in<br>the last at least 9,000 years and what<br>we wanted to do was apply some of these<br>techniques have applied two dogs and two<br>wolves and a maze to humans and see can<br>we also structure change in humans<br>through time is there a way we can test<br>this and we are testing it that the<br>place we care about right now is<br>basically on time run time is in Norway<br>halfway up the Norwegian coast it is<br>even more dark and miserable than<br>Dunedin it's amazing after they're<br>anywheres nice it's very nice in the<br>summer for about a day or two but it's<br>historically a very important place it's<br>not the capital today but it was the<br>capital this is San Olaf so Olaf was one<br>of those good old Saints that you could<br>become in the old days for dubious<br>practices so he famously slaughtered<br>thousands of Estonians and God was so<br>grateful they made in the st. so here's<br>the patron saint of Norway buried intron<br>time because he's buried there until<br>they're like 14th century Trondheim as<br>the capital of Norway it was a big<br>pilgrimage destination it was very<br>important for the people in that part of<br>the world and sure on times got the<br>other distinction that they really have<br>got a very well-documented record of<br>what happened in response to the big<br>thing that made life hell for most of<br>the last thousand years the Black Death<br>so you probably all heard about the<br>Black Death Black Death famously killed<br>at least 25% of Europe's population<br>between about 1350 and 1650<br>really horrendous thing cause we know<br>now<br>the bacteria senior pestis and what's<br>really nice about run time now again<br>really sucked in 1350 this is a<br>population trajectory of tron time as<br>estimated through archaeological<br>evidence and so you see that from about<br>a thousand ad when the cities founded<br>it's very important to know life is<br>buried there the population increases<br>pretty fast and then in 1349 plague<br>comes in and then everybody dies like 70<br>80 % of the population probably died<br>very quickly this is probably simplistic<br>it wasn't this fast but the numbers fit<br>that's a lot of people dying if you<br>think about seven out of ten people you<br>know basically vanishing next year<br>that's what happened so the next 300 or<br>so years the plague basically kept<br>coming back in cycles like it did<br>everywhere else the population never<br>really recovered until the plague<br>vanishes in late sixteenth century and<br>then it takes off again BAM and goes up<br>and up and up now this is fantastic<br>because that central period where<br>there's a big drop in the population you<br>can ask the question why didn't<br>everybody die right was it just because<br>some people were lucky because some<br>people have a better economic status<br>they could get rid of rats or is it<br>genetic diddly any some people have a<br>genetic mutations to give them<br>resistance to the plague and this is<br>what we've tried to test using these<br>techniques I'm talking about so it's<br>quite simple to do you basically get<br>hold of a load of skeletons from before<br>the plague from trondheim you get them<br>from after the plague now at one time as<br>I said is a cold horrible place<br>but it means skeletons preserved<br>beautifully they've got an amazing<br>skeletal record kept in a very very<br>freezing cold basement I should point<br>out so it's still not fun to work on<br>them but once you've got them before and<br>after the plague and you can sequence<br>modern-day Tron timers in their<br>traditional dress there you can sequence<br>their genomes you compare what's<br>happening through time so what did they<br>look like genetically before the plague<br>what does it like after the plague and<br>what they look like today and what has<br>been changing if something has changed<br>there's really two reasons for it either<br>so many people died and so many migrants<br>came in to replace and that will change<br>what they look like or many people died<br>but as proportion of them survived<br>because they were genetically in some<br>way able to survive the plague and the<br>way you compare this is quite simple you<br>just basically look at what DNA looks<br>like before the plague and after the<br>plague and<br>can basically plot it out this is a<br>complex looking figure but it just shows<br>the human genome across the horizontal<br>and it just shows positions that are<br>quite different between people before<br>and after plague and you can do it<br>before the plague and the present and<br>you can do it after the plague in the<br>present and whenever you see these big<br>Peaks like here for example well here or<br>here that suggests it's a particular<br>part of the genome that really is very<br>very different as a result of this time<br>effect and you can then plot them out in<br>different ways and you can look for<br>other any unusual things in there and so<br>in this plot here just look at the red<br>dots what the red dots are are bits of<br>the genome that are very very different<br>now to actually both before and after<br>the plague so in the last 300 or so<br>years they've really really changed and<br>you can actually zoom in on them they've<br>got little strange acronyms oftenly the<br>gene names and when you zoom in on these<br>genes you find that actually relates to<br>very important interesting things there<br>are eight things like bone growth muscle<br>growth inflammation and this is actually<br>quite interesting because people now are<br>a lot bigger than they used to be people<br>are you know generating more muscular<br>stronger and this suggests that genes<br>related to have been under very heavy<br>selection in the last 300 years<br>information is kind of cool there's been<br>more and more pathogenic challenges<br>coming in but also one of the real<br>problems today I'm sure many of you are<br>aware of is our pond with allergies<br>people they've got massively overactive<br>immune systems there's been a lot of<br>selection on inflammation which in<br>particular is what makes your life hell<br>when you've got hay fever but this is<br>all stuff that's just happened in the<br>last 300 years what happens when we look<br>at what I wanted to look at which is the<br>plague doing anything and that's what<br>this plot shows anything up in this<br>corner is things that again have changed<br>since about 1600 and the present<br>uniquely and things down here are things<br>that change before and after that big<br>epidemic and again you find genes and<br>you can look at them and you can see<br>what they do and we find basically two<br>groups of things all these ones in the<br>bottom corner are genes that we know<br>very important for the immune system<br>immune system fights pathogens they're<br>changing as a result of the plague it<br>looks very very much like there were<br>certain people who were genetically<br>resistant to the plague and therefore<br>actually made a big big difference what<br>was going on<br>ones at the top are actually linked to<br>bits of smallpox which itself as<br>interesting smallpox has been a very big<br>problem the last four or five hundred<br>years and maybe there's been also<br>genetic resistance to that so I'm going<br>to stop on that the point was that we<br>can now take you know these ancient DNA<br>techniques at the genome level study<br>biodiversity in this way start see<br>what's going on it's a technique that's<br>getting more and more important the main<br>limitations are they were once money<br>that's not a problem anymore because<br>getting cheaper and cheaper to do it<br>another main limitation was just simply<br>there was not enough people to do it but<br>actually this is becoming more and more<br>routine I personally get very irritated<br>when people view ancient DNA as a<br>discipline it's not really it's like a<br>standard everyday tool nearly the<br>limitations actually samples and this is<br>actually a real problem today for<br>geneticists because historically with<br>ancient DNA what we've done is we've<br>gone to people with their valuable<br>samples and said can we have a tiny bit<br>of one sample actually sorry<br>historically we would say can we have<br>the whole sample that's what we need to<br>use and then we would use it all up then<br>we got very good at making methods very<br>good at working on tiny bits of sample<br>and we will get sample from one sample<br>and be good but unfortunately today<br>because when the population area it<br>means we're actually back to the<br>destructive phase because we need to use<br>samples for many many many many samples<br>and that's actually there's a mindset<br>thing that people don't like to give up<br>many many samples but we can actually do<br>many many more powerful things when he<br>gets them so I shall stop there well<br>again say thank you very much to Lisa<br>and Michele in particular who invited me<br>and also I was in Auckland where Craig<br>Miller hosted me a lot of people put a<br>lot of work into this in particular guys<br>in my lab but we have a lot of<br>collaborators and the funders of course<br>and thank you for doing this I'm not<br>thank you very much thank you very much<br>Tom for a very inspiring and great talk<br>I enjoyed it very much and I'm sure so<br>will will you will you have um we have<br>time for questions and I'm sure there'll<br>be many questions that you would like to<br>ask them as long as they're not about<br>the potato blight the reasons like like<br>going to maybe I mean so the changes<br>we're seeing to do with highs embody and<br>stuff are actually things that have been<br>happening continually since the since a<br>thousand eighty to the present so they<br>weren't actually linked to play they<br>just seemed to the continual trait under<br>selection for a thousand years<br>you know genetics is extremely complex<br>so the one thing we're learning right<br>now is that we don't understand anything<br>about how things you know we could get<br>of finding things we really suck at<br>explaining that there's been some really<br>great talks here just the last few days<br>showing for exams that tertiary<br>structure of the genome have such huge<br>effect so yeah I wouldn't dare go on and<br>say what these things are actually doing<br>right now we really don't learn it's a<br>huge problem this is actually why if you<br>go back to when I was showing these<br>slides of the history of genomics and<br>how up to 2013 it was quite easy to<br>publish the genome the reason it's so<br>hard<br>or at least hard to publish the genome<br>in a taught journal now is simply<br>because people have worked out that just<br>seeing a correlation is not enough right<br>they want explanations now to get a<br>paper in nature or science now on a<br>genome you generally have to be either<br>very lucky to have a very sexy story or<br>you have to do exhaustive amounts of<br>actual functional work and these kind of<br>things to see what it's doing right<br>they've gone they've gone beyond the era<br>of just saying well you've got a name<br>and it does something and hand-waving is<br>enough unless it's Bigfoot<br>then you'll never get it published<br>and could you tell us what tissue is<br>best for ancient DNA when you for<br>example your 600 year aren't people yeah<br>well there are different answers to that<br>one answer is whatever the curator will<br>let you get away with sometimes you're<br>constrained by nothing about anything<br>else generally I mean if you've only got<br>bone you've only got bone but what you<br>can do is sort of maximize your chance<br>of it working so the reason ancient DNA<br>has restricted being a complete pain in<br>the bumps work with twofold firstly the<br>DNA just breaks down and goes away<br>secondly the DNA gets for the DNA from<br>elsewhere so microbes like to crawl<br>inside skeletons and digest them and<br>this makes everything very very<br>inefficient so if you can choose tissues<br>that the DNA's either better preserved<br>or basically the DNA degradation is<br>slower or they're more resistant to<br>microbes coming in you basically just<br>make your life easier and so we know for<br>example bone the porosity of bone varies<br>a lot all people have very porous bone<br>young people have less porous bone so<br>you can for example it tends to work out<br>that young people bone works better than<br>old people bone so they're less spongy<br>that's bacteria can get in there we know<br>that some bone is more dense than other<br>bones so it's very hot right now to take<br>the petrous bone from my pot skull<br>generally involves a lot of damage on<br>the skull but it's very very dense bone<br>it's very very well-preserved I actually<br>kind of made my name in DNA by proving<br>that actually a really good source of<br>hair hair is a very overlooked source of<br>DNA it's really great because when hair<br>is formed it the DNA breaks down at that<br>process then stops breaking down<br>afterwards it's very very resistant to<br>contamination so it's a very efficient<br>source of what's going on but you know<br>basically the sad thing about ancient<br>DNA is it's all difficult and it's just<br>how difficult is how expensive it's<br>never that easier situation unless<br>you're really lucky and finds link<br>deep-frozen<br>which happens occasionally and it really<br>is very very hard in this part of the<br>world and the Polynesia's people at Lisa<br>are really doing the absolute hardest<br>job thanks very interesting to most of<br>us probably like to think we're getting<br>smarter with time so do any of the genes<br>you find pretty<br>changing indicate changes in brain<br>development in ivory Nasser and the dogs<br>presumably not in the maze but the other<br>way yeah yeah so again you don't need to<br>look at ancient samples to look at that<br>when people compare the modern genome of<br>a modern dog and a modern wolf they find<br>yes I think I mean it's not my area but<br>they do find genes that annotated to do<br>with neural neurological system and that<br>kind of stuff that is assuming he's<br>getting smarter probably do with<br>behaviors changing and behaviors change<br>anything I mean you could argue that we<br>might well be smarter than cavemen at<br>using Facebook but if it comes to<br>fighting off saber-toothed Tigers you<br>know it's going to be different things<br>so that's the real problem smarter is<br>the relative thing and it's in what<br>context but yeah I mean there's a lot of<br>evidence that an even when you can pay<br>even humans to Neanderthals for example<br>in the animal genome or even going<br>further back to timothy's you see a lot<br>of selection is on genes to do with<br>something to do with the nervous system<br>but again this is where the heck is at<br>hand wavey<br>it's like what does that something<br>actually do we let's get it saying<br>thanks for the fascinating human story<br>I'm just being curious about the immune<br>genes you showed in the differences are<br>they actually just the gene frequencies<br>change or is actually those genes<br>actually probably in their chair se RA<br>you region I suppose yeah that's very<br>good question I would love to answer it<br>but I basically did on the airplane it<br>is a frequency change right off the<br>allele because that's what FST is<br>measuring so it's a base in allele is<br>very rare becomes very very common in<br>the population what it actually does<br>we're still working out so we're<br>actually right now running the analysis<br>see if it changes you know the function<br>of anything so I can't anse that right<br>now but is what we're basically looking<br>at and that's just to see if it has a<br>functional effect right but whether<br>sorry whether that change in the coding<br>effect then how the functional effects<br>the whole another question and that is<br>the more difficult there that has to be<br>done through years as graduate students<br>crying kind of stuff<br>glad you students will recognize that<br>yeah<br>any other questions I will the Lions win<br>yes yeah thanks we'll talk I understand<br>a lot of rapid evolutionary changes<br>relate to preserving juvenile traits<br>into adulthood mmm<br>are there genetic markers relation to<br>this I don't actually know the answer<br>that question I imagine there probably<br>are but yeah I'm afraid that's not my<br>area I mean a lot of people talk about<br>domestication being a retention of<br>juvenile features right so they say that<br>a lot of dog breeds kind of look kind of<br>like poppy ish right against bit<br>subjective but the idea is that<br>basically you're somehow repressing the<br>full development into kind of the adult<br>form and that's not really very<br>surprising when you're messing around<br>with the genome right you just basically<br>knock out one developmental process by<br>changing some gene of something that<br>stops some regulator and that will<br>happen but it is a curious thing that<br>you know when you look across domestic<br>animals and it is a bit subjective to<br>enter for authorization and like you<br>know you're signing things but they do<br>great um laughter no further questions<br>then please join me in thanking Tom for<br>a great talk<br>you</p></main><footer
