font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening everyone my pleasure to<br>welcome you here and introduce Ritchie's<br>talk public talk starting shortly the<br>context of this is the Dunedin School of<br>Medicine which is putting this on as<br>part of a two-day so research event that<br>we're having this day focused on our<br>postgraduate students with a public<br>lecture which Ricci is going to do and<br>tomorrow's focused on our whole school<br>getting together to talk about our<br>research plan the future and finishing<br>tomorrow evening with our research<br>awards we Richie as featured previously<br>so the we're at are really interesting<br>stage some really fascinating things I<br>mean today has been a revolution to me<br>that I've watched all I've seen all the<br>posters from our postgraduate students<br>and the cutting-edge science that is<br>happening is quite astounding and I<br>thought I knew a tall side but I didn't<br>the this particular lecture is actually<br>the culmination of a series of events<br>has occurred from before I came to<br>dunedin some thirty four years ago so 40<br>years ago approximately patricia<br>Buckfield was a pediatrician who<br>actually decided to do her MD thesis at<br>were during her work and she decided<br>she'd study all the babies born and<br>actually measure and do a very careful<br>measurements on these babies were born<br>in one year that was it that was what<br>she was going to do that lid on and<br>prepped somewhat unexpectedly to fill<br>silver taking on a role<br>almost a year on year rather than a<br>planned forty year follow-up to develop<br>the Dunedin study and to follow these<br>thousand children onwards so that the<br>study started and woman in children's<br>health moved to preventive and social<br>medicine and s it became more adult<br>focused and is now sitting in the<br>Department of Psychology in the Center<br>for brain health<br>s the the focus changes yet again but<br>it's an amazing story it's a story I<br>think that the whole University is very<br>proud of and I actually think the city<br>is very proud of and can take New<br>Zealanders proud<br>because it's it's been remarkable in<br>what it's been able to do so to actually<br>hear this evening<br>Ritchie who's really had a really<br>critical role over this last I can't<br>remember the exact number of years it<br>seems like quite a few to actually get<br>to the stage where it's got relatively<br>secure funding a new building within<br>which the work can be done and so the<br>implications of the research applying<br>really right across the whole of our<br>system is really a remarkable story in<br>itself and what we're going to learn<br>today is how he's managed to keep a<br>button in front of the curve how do you<br>actually keep doing this thing again and<br>again and again when most people perhaps<br>would have given up a long time ago so a<br>fascinating story this evening<br>Ritchie welcome and we're certainly get<br>at least I'm certainly very much looking<br>the balloon your eternal studies has<br>been going for over 40 years now the<br>study has grown in significance and<br>impact researchers all over the world<br>analyze its growing mountain of data<br>founder of the study dr. Phil Silva<br>could scarcely have imagined the<br>influence and importance the study would<br>achieve when he launched it in 1972 very<br>proud of the legacy I think that the<br>publications and outputs and the<br>influences on policy and the fact that<br>we've got the most documented sample of<br>human beings third sample of human<br>beings on the planet that gives me a<br>real sense of pride the study has<br>published on average a new scientific<br>paper every two weeks for four decades<br>and those papers are highly significant<br>if I had a list of the publication these<br>world-class scientists and scholars have<br>generated I could probably go on for<br>hours it's probably the world's most<br>successful longitudinal study of a<br>general community sample<br>it's an amazingly successful project no<br>question about it if you calculate the<br>impact factor of the Dunedin study it's<br>probably the highest of any study of the<br>behavioral sciences and it's creeping up<br>the study has made discoveries in<br>virtually every area of human health and<br>behavior including gene by environment<br>interactions that cause violence<br>depression and schizophrenia measurement<br>in childhood that predict health and<br>wealth and adult life has it bought<br>future criminals and kindergartens and<br>why teenagers run off the rails the<br>Dunedin study is known in our field in<br>many fills has just a hallmark and<br>landmark study I mean just a brilliantly<br>conceived study and whoever came up with<br>the idea should be really thanked this<br>is Nobel Prize winning stuff killer<br>topper I wondered who would come tonight<br>it's a cold midweek night and I thought<br>there might be ten maybe a dozen people<br>including Barry and Steve so I'm a<br>little surprised and I'm grateful that<br>you've wanted to come out to hear me<br>talk a little bit about what makes the<br>Dunedin study special now it's been a<br>hell of a few days isn't it I hope that<br>someone that what is the like like<br>support all these weird academics and<br>loves and support I mean we whoop<br>Alliance on Saturday right now on the<br>back of course The Hondas whooping them<br>to X Prai and then some glycol Peter<br>billing does that Anna's team does a<br>remarkable thing because the yacht<br>racing is not about yachts really it's<br>about resource and power and reputation<br>and you take on America at your peril<br>and they did it and they won so an<br>extraordinary moment when I've got a<br>real thrill out of so much so that I<br>walked out I was on the red-eye that<br>morning walked out without my wallet so<br>I've been away for two days just got<br>back two hours ago and I've been walking<br>walking around say but know what's<br>amazing who doesn't open their wallet<br>for you in that predicament<br>so part of the time I was away I<br>attended a board meeting of the PO which<br>is New Zealand's national mental health<br>workforce board and one of the one of my<br>code the Wreckers the woman called<br>Shelly Campbell a remarkable woman in<br>many ways she's that for a day job she's<br>the chair of the Sir Peter Blake trust<br>and she walked into our board meeting on<br>the day and she handed out this to all<br>of the board members now I know this has<br>been live stream so only the people who<br>live stream will get to see what expect<br>me I'm picking out of here but it's a<br>bunch of red socks all your punches is<br>to Red Sox alright now after you can see<br>and we all but the sneakers milk<br>stupidly like children whipped off their<br>shoes and ice off and put these on and<br>people we're putting their feet up on a<br>board table at various clothes took me<br>suppose with their red socks on but what<br>it says is 1995 2015 so if Peter Blake<br>trust these are anniversary socks from<br>the first time that we won America's Cup<br>as a Peter Blake led that consortium<br>that did what they thought then was<br>impossible and 20 years as small becky's<br>in my terms I mean we're 45 years was<br>more than double that however it made me<br>think that Peter Burling and his team<br>did an amazing thing yesterday morning<br>but of course it started way back then<br>it started with Sir Peter Blake thinking<br>that New Zealand was good enough to take<br>on America and then doing the business<br>so we're all in here at legacies I more<br>than most so this the Red Sox are my cue<br>to in our love it that Barry<br>acknowledged Patricia Buckfield and Phil<br>I want to do the same you know that the<br>Google idea about shoulders and standing<br>on and all that sort of stuff I mean<br>that's been borrowed from somewhere else<br>and some<br>else after that it's so true here this<br>point in the history of the study and I<br>know that I'll be pushing up daisies and<br>then it'll be chugging along still going<br>from strength to strength this study is<br>a product of many people's efforts over<br>a very long period of time not least of<br>which is with the kneading community so<br>it started all those years ago and it<br>started on on the out on the smell of an<br>oily rag and was really made possible by<br>the efforts of many people in the<br>division community so not only do I Phil<br>and Patricia but I've knowledge all<br>those people from that period of time<br>before right long before I came along<br>that made this study as superb as study<br>as it is because it's the foundations<br>upon which we are now building that<br>makes it special we do our part in this<br>journey to keep making it as special as<br>we can but if we did not have the superb<br>foundations that were built by the<br>people that came before us we would not<br>be near as good as we are so I take my<br>head off to the Christians to the hard<br>labour and to the love but oh ha that<br>went into making this one of this the<br>foundations of the key we all know that<br>that's a truism no more true in this<br>case now for those that don't know about<br>the Dunedin study and I don't presume<br>that everyone does it be Caribbean and<br>me I'm going to give you a very quick<br>overview and then I'm going to Prague<br>that overview segue into some key issues<br>that Asbury alluded to had preoccupied<br>me terms of me doing well hand on the<br>tiller this period of time to studies<br>history making sure than to mess it up<br>and then IDM in making it a bit better<br>so there's a contemporary feel to the<br>issues but I can go back and forth on<br>time easily I've been involved with my<br>23rd are putting forth year of<br>involvement in a managerial sense I<br>first interviewed on this study a third<br>of a century ago<br>and I was a callow youth of 22 peroxide<br>hair rings on every finger<br>earrings the whole deal at age 13 they<br>thought this guy might be interesting to<br>13 euros because the rest of the staff<br>are all 50 plus and we'll carnies but<br>you'll notice that h13 for what it's<br>worth is that eructation rate plummeted<br>nothing whatsoever to do with me<br>so thousand 37 babies who were born at<br>Queen Mary in that one year period April<br>1st 72 to March 31 73 and he was still<br>resident in the great urban even<br>metropolitan area three years later<br>enrolled in the short term child<br>multidisciplinary study was haven't met<br>the one for five years clearly we can't<br>count three world out here but the<br>original cohort of a thousand thirty<br>seventh was a subset thank goodness it<br>wasn't a small subset it was a majority<br>of most people that were eligible by<br>being risen with the median metropolitan<br>area 11 hadn't 39 were actually still<br>around so ninety-one percent when<br>approached<br>would you enroll in the study we've got<br>to try to understand how the baby feel<br>were born in adverse circumstances and<br>we're now being saved because of the<br>increased sophistication of birth<br>technology that had been during the 60s<br>of those bubs were fearing as well as<br>their counterparts who had not bought<br>America's circumstances so H 3 and H 5<br>was the plan now SPECT assisted H 3 and<br>H 5 and Phil who was a bit of a maverick<br>this is the sort of guy that can sell<br>ice to the Eskimos he managed to parlay<br>from findings at age 5 about Heather to<br>unrecognized high rates of for example<br>blue ear into further funding right<br>child health shock was the news at age<br>five and Phil I didn't know that Phil<br>had a career in mind I confess this to<br>me a long time ago I said no this is the<br>beauty of these long achievements<br>ecology just keep on doing the same all<br>that and I said and I see the same old<br>status now I know you know what I mean<br>so Phil had a twinkle in his eye way<br>back then she thought if I can keep this<br>thing going it<br>value because I've discovered some<br>important things about health and New<br>Zealand that were not recognized<br>Ministry of Health got a real kick up<br>the tail a real wake-up call and whole<br>bunch of things are flowed from that and<br>I can document pivot point out selected<br>with the legal study findings and early<br>yes that through five years of the study<br>anyway so Phil managed to keep things<br>going as you can see over here<br>the group on the thousand thirty seventy<br>followed up every couple of years when<br>they were children and then the enter<br>assessment carriers begin to get a<br>little bit longer so age fifteen then we<br>go to three year cycles for a couple<br>then we stretch up the fire then we go<br>to six and now on seven why is that who<br>lose it that who's that wise piston<br>outfit no ever it no not really<br>and I'll get the funding don't worry<br>that's because the amount of<br>developmental change that occurs say<br>between seven and nine is quite<br>significant<br>you don't want to miss too much of a<br>pedes of a period of life which happens<br>significant changes happening whereas<br>the comparison between a person at 53<br>and 35<br>not much going on I can tell you in 53<br>to 55 it's not sitting on what's going<br>on if we're only going on it's all bad I<br>could know you as well so you've got<br>this developmental reason for stretching<br>out that won't always be the case as I<br>say I'll be pushing updating that the<br>study will be still surging along and I<br>imagine the interphase assessments or<br>gets smaller because the amount of<br>developmental change you would have<br>another word for a possibly in the<br>letter years increases as well so that's<br>what we've done up to phase 45 we're<br>currently in the field against the<br>question mark alright we've been in the<br>field for 12 weeks now<br>sense a fantastic stage of the of the<br>assessment of the study where you're<br>back in the field<br>and being responsible for ensuring that<br>the data from the last assessment has<br>been written up well you get back to the<br>field and that means seeing the study<br>members and it's a really nice time I<br>get to see them whenever I'm in town at<br>morning tea lunch time and anonymously<br>interesting bunch of people and lovely<br>to boot what you'll notice over here by<br>the way is what pretty high retention<br>rates yes in fact if you fill up the<br>next best in the world out here for a<br>study of this length and tight when I<br>say type I'm not talking literally<br>because we're kind of unusual all the<br>things we do but life course studies<br>that have tried to follow the general<br>population sampling that's the nature of<br>the study at the general population<br>circles all those birds born in Queen<br>Mary most selection effects it's not a<br>bunch of volunteers because they're a<br>typical not a bunch of students they<br>very atypical not a bunch of Christmas<br>again a typical in a different way this<br>is all walks of life remember got ninety<br>one percent the nine percentage said no<br>thanks look no different in terms of<br>pure natal characteristics or such a<br>demographic factors so we reckon got a<br>really faithful snapshot of a generation<br>of that time and then we've managed to<br>keep them intact so to speak now why is<br>this important well they won't surprise<br>you I hope to know that the major threat<br>to the value or validity of these sorts<br>of enterprises is what they call<br>non-random loss to follow-up that means<br>that the people that are first the drift<br>away it has to give back in and not a<br>random group oh if they only were laughs<br>it'd be a lot simpler you just start<br>with a huge number of people that have<br>whittled down over time and you wouldn't<br>get great like me worrying about are we<br>going to get 90 plus percent but<br>unfortunately a lot of random random<br>group and complete opposite these people<br>who are hardest to find and to get back<br>in and the people you really are<br>interested in seeing they are people<br>with an who multiple difficulties<br>aggregate<br>they don't even fix the boat they may<br>not have a cellphone on purpose they may<br>be on the run from the law they may be<br>in and out of institutions they live<br>under embankments or in the dissident<br>modern territory these are people that<br>are hard to track how to retain and<br>cohorts like these now interestingly if<br>the next-best slide was brought up it'll<br>be about two-thirds max what about 50%<br>you know immediately then that 60% that<br>the average 50 or 60 percent atlas<br>period time is not a full selection of<br>humanity anymore it's the highly<br>motivated the high achieving it's the<br>compliant it's not those hard to get and<br>retain people between multiple<br>difficulties aggregated so most of all<br>data or knowledge about human health and<br>development is based on a rose-tinted<br>picture except here we've managed to<br>keep virtually everyone involved and<br>that gives us confidence in our causal<br>inferences what are also does is allow<br>us to do stuff that overturns<br>conventional wisdom or dogma and that's<br>always an exciting time when you say by<br>the way everything that's ever been said<br>about this or in every book is wrong you<br>know it's like putting the hidden in the<br>stop for the stoning and heading to Mars<br>right at you but invariably what we find<br>is once people get the head around the<br>data and the findings at the necessary<br>data to replicate and try what we have<br>done or shown has been supported or<br>replicated so we're in an unusual<br>position where we've got a general<br>population sample and taken by bias<br>we've managed to keep the all evolve<br>virtually the 5% we haven't seen<br>probably wouldn't bias results no matter<br>how strong a respect there was all right<br>so it's virtually the whole country and<br>by the way when I put this up the slide<br>it shocks people you know in the game<br>yeah how's this done this something no<br>it makes me look stupid or in it and<br>there's a real strangeness actually<br>about being the boss above the lady<br>study because people don't want to<br>engage with you because there's sort of<br>a set of rules for everyone else and<br>it's different for them so we'll<br>discount them one of the funniest bit of<br>this is that I was giving a talk and in<br>North America one day it was a typical<br>lecture theatre but like the ones at the<br>medical school we hear these high<br>seating arrangements and people have a<br>better wouldn't they they lean on and<br>what's that Jesus is hard work it was<br>Wednesday night after all that's<br>someone's chin hitting the wood so I've<br>made up I made up a story and some<br>people heard this before but I still<br>find it amusing I made up a story too<br>you know the bit of theory of mine what<br>are they thinking well because they kind<br>of shape the head and make all there's a<br>lot of cattitude that come your way and<br>then they go away and they think<br>something and well I think they think is<br>comedic never heard the place before<br>right now I must the bottom of South<br>Island and that's at the bottom of New<br>Zealand which is at the bottom of the<br>world you get my drift here this was not<br>pretty pretty right so these poor folks<br>further out that's so boring down there<br>all they do is sit around in between<br>these assessments wait it have been<br>reinvented her life that's how they get<br>this remarkable retention rate well no<br>so don't worry about the details of<br>numbers too much just know that 25<br>percent of our cohort when we last saw<br>the complete Co world when they were 38<br>lived outside New Zealand and we all<br>know that I mean you might expect that<br>in the 20s but this is a 38 this is<br>approaching your 40s so 25% of outside<br>New Zealand two-thirds of that shirt by<br>the way living the west arm that place<br>there<br>you know Phyllis I'll be a 13% North<br>nemesis imagine the challenges of<br>keeping track of people getting them<br>back and there they are that's only half<br>of it by the way<br>you know we can get people back we could<br>see them for a stage I'll talk a little<br>bit about their attention later on and<br>more detail but we've got to get them<br>home safe as well and that's not always<br>straightforward human beings being human<br>beings will go off and do all sorts of<br>interesting things some of which are<br>dangerous and game them up in trouble<br>and all the listen no I probably I when<br>things go bad it's always comes to me I<br>have responsibility to get them back to<br>their heart from that's left up so the<br>major undertaking getting all those<br>people back I'll talk a little bit more<br>about this food because I'm a very<br>responsive speaker Steve Robertson said<br>what do you think about these four<br>things or touch on these four things so<br>I'm going to adjust them exactly see<br>usually people when they get that for<br>the script they kind of change it to<br>suit themselves buckle up front a dress<br>exactly what you must need to address<br>this being one of them how do we do this<br>within generate thing I've added a bit<br>more to round the talk out so are what I<br>liked is where general population<br>staffing with high integrity over output<br>the longest period of time documented<br>and we also do this is the third leg of<br>the stool that makes us unique we've<br>also been doing from the beginning so<br>again hats off the fill and Patricia<br>we're doing multidisciplinary or<br>interdisciplinary research why don't you<br>everyone now wants to do that because<br>everyone knows that that is the brain<br>talks to the gut and the immune system<br>takes the gun and the social world gets<br>under the skin to cause cardiovascular<br>damage why do we all know that now why<br>don't we go that you've got to do a<br>holistic take on people well among<br>others a leading study is shown and then<br>is the case but when Phil<br>founded the study with Patricia although<br>all those years ago I think we have to<br>basically coin the term<br>so every fund that in the developed<br>world with this salt wants to prioritize<br>multidisciplinary research we've got<br>almost half a century start on them<br>pretty good at gettin filled out these<br>three factors combined to make this a<br>very special global resource now this is<br>this is then this is age thirty a what<br>we used to study so just to give you a<br>very busy slide because method<br>subliminally convey how busy we are what<br>you have is a sort of classic social<br>logical work you know inequalities of<br>the web we have specialized programs to<br>research any social behavior for example<br>I give lead this is the most detailed<br>database of a development of antisocial<br>behavior in the world bar none<br>and I guess proof of that I can't just<br>move a little out there and without<br>giving you some evidence as to why that<br>might be the case the queen of Sweden<br>conferred the Nodell equivalent the<br>Stockholm price on Terry Moffett who<br>leads this program research in 2007 we<br>have an increasing interest as various<br>mentioned that's why we're now in<br>psychology because the importance of the<br>brain for everything happens in people's<br>lives and we were doing behavioral<br>mental health stuff for a long long time<br>and that's a real strength of health but<br>we also cover a physical end of the<br>health spectrum so this is Marie in the<br>audience Marie Thompson<br>Marie thompson's a professor of public<br>health dentistry at the dental school<br>and he over the last 20 25 years has<br>made this a unique study within itself<br>within that particular program research<br>on oral health in the world there's no<br>study that has data from age 5 through<br>to that point of peak health and early<br>adulthood preceding studies into old age<br>so they sheesh Kathryn understanding the<br>natural history of oral health condition<br>be they periodontal disease or tooth<br>loss or carries alright this is the only<br>study that has that period of coverage<br>now that could be seen of the number of<br>these disciplinary silos<br>respiratory health behavioral health<br>if it's not the leading program research<br>in the world by itself in that<br>discipline it's up there in the top<br>handful but that's not the what I want<br>to provide you is the fact we've got all<br>those high quality individual<br>disciplinary catches covered and then we<br>can marry them in true multidisciplinary<br>fashion it's an ideal setup all right so<br>we've got wonderful multidisciplinary<br>data and you know how do we give it if I<br>alluded to it with the International<br>slide I said we bring everyone back so<br>we don't ring them up and say okay Barry<br>here you go<br>have you had an STI lately or see you've<br>been buffing Robyn will serve you how<br>does that anxiety the sort of yours<br>going or rich and whatever we don't go<br>out of their homes would it be next best<br>all right because you can only take so<br>much on the train or on the plane to<br>someone's home and of course what we<br>have is the ability was we bring<br>everyone back to have experimental<br>control all right we've got them in the<br>lab so they're all these empty machines<br>wonderfully fancy machines but number of<br>staff are here tonight and they run them<br>so you got body to vinaigrettes like a<br>fox if you sit in and you close the door<br>you they're always London maneuvers they<br>call them which means why the spread is<br>huffing and puffing and if it's all that<br>stuff that's going on in your land it's<br>chance over nemesis computer over and<br>you get some really good<br>they come back and tell you another<br>person's lung health he could we can<br>have each other pop into them into the<br>new building so push you can't take that<br>out of the few you can't see whole bunch<br>of things to do out into the field the<br>sight machine is here a machine we need<br>a soundproof room for them some of the<br>cardiovascular assistants you can't be<br>logging with some mixing the government<br>like the bike we get clear happy<br>we've been everyone but so what we have<br>three things that life is pretty special<br>integrity retention general population<br>summer retention then we have a red<br>multi disability from the get cut we're<br>not back filling a team of so I do now<br>you can't back till that's the whole<br>point of their prospect that through<br>time studies we can't do it<br>retrospectively you miss stuff that they<br>were born bred and this depth is the<br>depth of measurement the gold standard<br>measurement direct measurement because<br>in any form of measurement in some error<br>the best thing you can do is to measure<br>the phenotype of a parameter or<br>construct of interest derivative with<br>high quality fall of the field<br>approaches so we combine those three<br>things and that works best I think<br>putting it sort of at the forefront<br>within our particularly area we could<br>also take blood under control conditions<br>which is very helpful at the Naval the<br>numbered one both settings oh we get<br>onto blood even how we stay here to the<br>curve it's real pointer to them to the<br>title the talk the newly to thousands<br>we've got a few reviews all to the<br>Consul in time and they see something<br>like isn't that a great study the real<br>shame they don't have more information<br>about the family of origin given the<br>families of origin either by social<br>learning pathways or genetics influence<br>what happened from the next generation<br>but the strength of association varies<br>by individuals or by family groups<br>right so we could ever actually get some<br>more and in a typical Dunedin study this<br>is you know stay ahead of the curve just<br>means rolling your sleeves up losing<br>have been an ass so we've rolled our<br>sleeves up until let's go back and see<br>the parents directly some we're not<br>living together anymore that was fine<br>we'll see them in the gear box where<br>they are living together still we'll see<br>them separately<br>same ethical process applies wherever we<br>see any member of a family it's totally<br>private between us and then we will<br>never tell anyone anyone under any<br>circumstances what people tell us<br>interesting process of course yet mum<br>and dad in different rooms answering the<br>same questions and having people answers<br>I'll leave that to your imagination<br>anyway we've managed to get mums and<br>dads most were still alive that was<br>fantastic<br>just lucky really that wasn't good<br>planning that's just good luck and they<br>reported on themselves their spouse<br>their brothers and sisters their<br>spouse's brothers and sisters they get<br>their parents from both sides and the<br>siblings of the study member so stay<br>here is a curveball we what are some<br>stuff on that on appearance but what an<br>opportunity gets more information so<br>we've got eight thousands family members<br>reported on in our family of origin<br>dataset and that's we call family<br>liability alright so if you're doing an<br>analysis between risk sector a and<br>outcome P in controlling for potential<br>third variable or influencing that the<br>see you'll never know whether that a to<br>be a low is real unless you can control<br>from family history ideally so we've got<br>that we've got they haven't had that<br>topic now but we've gone the other way<br>as well against trying to stay here the<br>curve we've studied the next generation<br>of the COBOL but let me point out<br>straight away this is not the same study<br>done again our group remember what<br>unselected right all walks of life with<br>no selection effects<br>but everyone will want to Queen Mary you<br>could not get a more selective group of<br>the children could you because they have<br>to be the children of these study<br>members so it's a very limited use<br>strictly speaking of no groups but I<br>think it can be quite in the direction<br>of trends to say generation a is<br>different from Generation V so what I<br>would do anything well the interesting<br>thing that we're looking at here is<br>whether our study members transmit will<br>pass on certain trails or attribute your<br>abilities or lack there on the next<br>generation we're looking for continuity<br>and discontinuity and trying to work out<br>why there is continuity and not in<br>continuity and that is essentially<br>another window on the angle see the main<br>study la virginal study is really about<br>using age as your leverage point on<br>negative things last people that<br>understand this I think it's about thank<br>you form of Epidemiology where we<br>counted up through five we're using<br>aliens as a leave I'm trying to<br>understand what the driving associations<br>or relationship all our plans and here's<br>another way of using age at across<br>generations there's another window you<br>know it's going to take 20 years of this<br>packet we need to get the first board<br>three-year-olds say and I saw that and<br>15 a later esting we see all the study<br>mentions children so I just want the<br>firstborn and then I run for another 23<br>years because people have children<br>terminators<br>so for the letter long feminism and what<br>it does has augment the main study you<br>can see how painstaking we can be we<br>have appeared to be patient I fully<br>expect this to be going on well after<br>I've got I started this because I<br>recognized what I did here and I thought<br>other leaders I don't this one<br>add something to it so that people have<br>come asking me can go where they cook<br>people back then Calais officer I never<br>thought exactly that way but that is the<br>motivation is to give something back not<br>for the people before me but the people<br>coming out oh yeah<br>Philip bot biomarker studies we draw<br>blood we take about 110 mils does not<br>that much it's about one quarter of the<br>game work but we have it in two<br>different choose different preparation<br>yeah she looks like this look to bring<br>Coolidge like my beverage you know<br>there's about 19 different choose but<br>the study members are incredible they<br>will put up with almost anything within<br>reach so they believe that they are<br>going to help others that's what makes<br>them come and I'll come back to that as<br>well<br>so I'll say here the curve I you need<br>some sort of overarching thing or<br>terrible economic sleepy a little bit of<br>any on the vision I thought to go to<br>sleep when I hear people talk about<br>these propositions and please don't go<br>to sleep when I talk about over arts and<br>things you know what of this well we<br>have an overriding theme when the<br>children we know that has understanding<br>child development what about a volunteer<br>twenties well this understanding<br>cultures behavior because people would<br>be getting to in big in develop habits<br>that couldn't be taught the moment all<br>the structured to their health now for<br>watching fine<br>what are we doing we're beginning<br>blame to understand the processes of<br>aging because they're older the inform<br>the process to get there begins from<br>petition and must gerontologist was<br>clearly available<br>there'll be anybody's all right it<br>doesn't confuse but that's what the<br>literature says as in the person of<br>gradual right now lyrically wrongful<br>physiological systems through time and<br>we cook for the Wilsons interesting the<br>multi-discipline bit here they say from<br>the Cape Cod oh what a really<br>localization stuff isolated from the<br>beginning play local hard message to<br>self and we must Adam coming to a few<br>what the Canadian staring down the<br>Barrell the abyssal one of those who are<br>caught we put Anna greater protection I<br>mean the best application either put in<br>in what 16 years as the head had been<br>funded every other time and the funny my<br>triage yeah the worst fear in the most<br>food that love control experiment of the<br>same application into an American<br>funding entity all other than political<br>whatever that's about who knows and who<br>cares was my attitude you know you can<br>get bogged down with it but all you can<br>do in those circumstances if you want to<br>stay in it stay they're going to save in<br>the surgery<br>you just know halogen I come from the<br>school my supervisor was a hard-ass and<br>he taught me that explained I can play<br>melee alright so when they're all we do<br>is pull our socks up get through somehow<br>the next year we managed to do that<br>thankfully in became to a service<br>interim funding you get right back into<br>it I took a gamble I thought I'm not<br>going to change a damn thing all I did<br>was add another reference happened to be<br>a reference on the process of aging that<br>we published in there in Germany they<br>were devoted to me the fourth most<br>important or interesting science outcome<br>of the year but you got to do a bit of<br>marketing of the almost of the grubby<br>sort sometimes you know you can't be<br>Precious about these things you know now<br>we've got the totalizing thing that<br>leaks all the individual programs<br>research each one of those programs<br>research databases are stiff enough oral<br>health middle doc nurse<br>if I'm going to have special sporting in<br>our researchers lead the way and<br>contribute to those preserves or even<br>both clinicians right that they're<br>bringing butter but the really<br>interesting stuff versus deficits above<br>that is multiplicity the unifying thing<br>brings from all ends in one place my<br>generation who told me that we're<br>observe us multiple physiological<br>systems report therefore it looks like a<br>measure across all those disciplines to<br>come over the omnibus or Supra phenotype<br>of aging and so the paper house is<br>delimited that show with this time<br>hanging people through the same agency<br>of different biological engines right so<br>one of the beauties of the studies that<br>said when your child has over 30 days<br>that this biological a Turkish language<br>in 28 to 61 right now all other things<br>being equal<br>you never say for the people were<br>biologically 38 so over 45 were that<br>bring most likely whoever's am attracted<br>to be the people in the whisked health<br>to delete the people that developed a<br>non communicable diseases i cancer<br>income investing from from diabetes and<br>COPD and that are really the initiative<br>in the procedure non communicable<br>disease group now 80 is very much<br>ubiquitous respected for developing<br>those problems<br>people often completely and safe talk<br>about anything of synonymous with any<br>cancer and carried us to the problem is<br>in cyclic in the Pingdom that helps<br>drive the emerges of those problems so<br>if you want to step back in a causal<br>chain you want to go to aging so that's<br>why we're in for a good spaces<br>weird-looking if wonderful under metals<br>that drive the aging<br>in that case who's aging too quickly we<br>also put them on a few moves over or<br>really well can next year's a lot of<br>mechanisms as well<br>people come a lot we deal with that<br>business of models and certain oil and<br>all that sort of stuff all of that is a<br>silly idea or discussion all steps of<br>analysts paradigm you have it all yet<br>so we look at offerings to try<br>understand what people and activities<br>office understand to help the people go<br>do it really well<br>well I could presented it really well<br>it's the people that aren't doing so<br>well we're going to try and help them<br>all right so we're going to finalize the<br>long ending to continue with the view to<br>inform prevention ideally top of Nebadon<br>of wonderful he met or early<br>intervention that's beginning to emerge<br>that's our rezulin edge is to come up<br>with really good processes and a really<br>good model camping stuff and how they<br>play out there tonight so you can live<br>it from the bug sweet spot for<br>information stop people ending up<br>miserable or sick all living look at the<br>burglar or hurting emotion as funny when<br>we published over that reinventing then<br>and we do some remarkable replication<br>tell Julian three that I get<br>reimbursement by some members of the<br>press and say you've stigmatized why is<br>it this country once you identify them<br>on a billion for what it is your<br>cigarette lighter for one per money to<br>me is a clear signal that societal all<br>systems would in society if you respond<br>with care so ha talk about xi i their<br>love and good officially provisions I<br>grow very tired of people that go hmm<br>you know that's not good<br>so shaquita versus people to see<br>different labor senator anyway I haven't<br>gotten to my point mi so within your as<br>you come as a searching for the right on<br>metal your own hearts and things you've<br>gotta really understand you all mesh in<br>your website with you laughs this<br>research rights helped then<br>understanding and my place is help<br>because I get to review whole bunch of<br>international programs are social I'm<br>putting on a failed given that's going<br>on in my life force will it's a small<br>world when you break it down by<br>discipline the type subtype and I like<br>that some people are forecasting the<br>difficulty sorts of bugs or some<br>infinities I know that they're affected<br>together code fifty totals and that<br>looks pretty impressive company and<br>they're going to use all fifty counties<br>now down licorice right I should be in<br>the universe why aren't I because I know<br>quality of those filters not needed up<br>to the 40 rounds so but I need to<br>understand it the design part that's<br>worth organic so we can position<br>ourselves so that we are working<br>sadistically or in parallel or a<br>stripper heat to remain preeminent and<br>are going you can't go to sleep in this<br>work in a wolf site really well and it<br>naturally hadn't you end up reviewing<br>stuff as a good thing<br>what about one in the world of size got<br>your size to be a world assignment well<br>the value of these sorts of studies is<br>seriously enchant if you can link to the<br>lab or do you get into for examination<br>by effects but I'm not going to buy the<br>land it's basically we hope you do<br>things with mice alright so we make um<br>observation about certain types of<br>respectively the certain types of<br>outcomes we would not qualify the<br>mechanisms explain an association and<br>thought is an association and then that<br>might have multiple took your<br>neurotransmitter system and then in what<br>a facility what time the narrative<br>template system should be default you<br>can't do that they're people all sorts<br>of obvious reasons that you came to with<br>an animal models all right then you can<br>be moved from a boutique study like ours<br>into a national palace tick for example<br>but they've all been using impede<br>integrating data infrastructure and test<br>that will supply to the population at<br>last if they never got available so you<br>want to get a very high external<br>brought a frontier population alright so<br>that's the world will slide the ferrule<br>and it's included that in population<br>intervention system without goal<br>replying to be helping informed<br>interventions the women tonight that we<br>had in front of pipeline of the other<br>animals Titian local very source have<br>cover when they have to intervention<br>studies at their skirts and next we<br>received so I spent a clause in a<br>Medicaid from I concur with<br>interventionist now my father's I know<br>rewired clusters even colossus joomla<br>what is the author of this really<br>interesting book now let's get it well<br>but i'm not watching enough they'll<br>better bet it based on Irene nurture<br>looks like that's all right and I kept<br>it as its insatiable but it also pushes<br>them my understanding of where things<br>are going this thing image of innovation<br>great assailable alright and it tells<br>you something very important in this<br>fact that we food gathered we are met<br>with the one it's trying to create<br>knowledge with the releases and<br>enforcing practices to change things for<br>the better<br>and without that one happen you can get<br>very frustrated right now this book<br>takes it apart why don't all of a sudden<br>in that one such a different mindset<br>when you realize that the tire model to<br>you<br>is actually pretty simple give him a<br>mate cell systems institution and how<br>far they haven't really changed more<br>than that in exam because I wear another<br>hat as he sacrifices the Ministry of<br>such a development not part of the<br>pregnancy cycle like I know that in this<br>country was a very unusual opportunity<br>where research done directly independent<br>and now Magna think about how your money<br>is spent and that research has been<br>created around the flavor it doesn't a<br>truck or a physical the world every<br>nineteen but it's actually being taken<br>very very seriously special thing about<br>New Zealand has flawlessly under the<br>same system you couldn't do this inside<br>a federal state or if it's being<br>negotiated<br>very very unusual situation opportunity<br>but you need to rewire yes move the next<br>item 50 world<br>alright and that sort of stuff these<br>sort of movie book about riveting read<br>they're really really valuable to<br>understand the broader picture dripping<br>to go so the next thing I'm going to<br>believe in what I believe I'm saying<br>this but you know disruptive<br>technologies are you hear more and more<br>about something one machine learning so<br>Hilton people expected better classroom<br>if I got a rebate but I wanna you know<br>have stuff into this new world that is<br>coming it's like a circle is a big way<br>above us and walk<br>right anyway horizon scanning man is not<br>next to your five years think and<br>decades as so the way we've set up dates<br>will be five in my mind is going to be<br>the basic structural skeleton of the<br>next 30 years resistance so thinking<br>that true it wasn't about here America<br>is this going to be right in twenty<br>years time<br>so what we do to make sure those bases<br>are covered my errand of sight we've<br>dusted that when spelling them as with<br>children BBQing right the first three<br>things are in conditions of problems<br>listed in the top 10 problems in the<br>world of disease the global government<br>of these project without putting out a<br>this report every year now there's a big<br>one of in 1992 delicate thing and happy<br>hearing sight chronic kidney injury mass<br>most beautiful the most prevalent<br>elitism in terms of rigging Liza crazy<br>misery so why are we doing this lightly<br>and initially when I was putting this<br>forward as musters people will say well<br>why don't we keep doing what we're doing<br>we're going to do that as well but if<br>there's time someone's going to say why<br>on earth couldn't we do these sweeping<br>right we're just trying to get only the<br>state over fear just be where we should<br>be in this place and what something that<br>so one person that oversees just to get<br>involvement over I was slightly bedside<br>and hearing is Peter form this is an<br>approval from University of New Zealand<br>basic hearing experience so I ran lesson<br>for the end of the university<br>flour-based cup country and obviously<br>fee muscular scale it's legal<br>this is a vector where is he from the<br>audience I know that the realtor through<br>the portal there is he's leading this<br>new program research I've wanted this to<br>happen for a long time mercilessly there<br>was a possibility and opportunity and<br>they've been here it all came together<br>thank you kidney function rob walker<br>black america past each other in the<br>coral for decades now and probably means<br>economy now is it in these talk about<br>kidneys another year leading by keeping<br>on the bobbing so funny on whatever<br>quietly very important so rotten you and<br>really<br>really dawn on baby would be divisive<br>lighten up a facility I like the new<br>access diapers how they made it die<br>you can people kill the parameters now<br>argue argue argue about which you can do<br>it by self-report stuff war Diaries or<br>little them and and I putting in a<br>fearful part of years like the brain<br>McDonald a nutritionist and but I'd give<br>it but a lot way to do this was to come<br>up with Sacramento River Ridge the<br>property love that we take which into<br>identifying environment double like not<br>very environment so you feel the usual<br>stuff only sativa where we're giving an<br>assertive and you saw its roots it'll<br>and quotes trying to understand sure<br>exploding isotope in the type of product<br>if you need to sit in front of sugar<br>that needs a lot that's all very easy<br>start Manuel and then automated stresses<br>have been a big hole in our research as<br>far as I can observe and I'm a<br>behavioral science and psychology<br>sideline and what I made a mark<br>physiologist that the good thing is you<br>people learn to connected you have to<br>know that a summers talking pork askew<br>than the time to be doing that I'm going<br>to tell you at the bitter to prosperity<br>well I better get on top of all right<br>I'm not electricity Louisville TN and in<br>Christchurch you missed an entire<br>Croatia is a world leader in free<br>relative morality and I've talked to<br>proceed over the years can you do<br>something and finally they've got the<br>technology to do something useful the<br>obvious stuff is also going to look at<br>the figure day she looks for the jion's<br>while another priceless<br>that's real and clear in the most useful<br>so now are using that's really nice very<br>proud of that that's setting the scene<br>for research programs will grow flourish<br>and intially through time again as I say<br>that well after I'm gone so the fishing<br>I just got one for that was easy<br>music improvements and use modern<br>technologies always trying to keep ahead<br>of the curve did so psychology was very<br>trying to me and they gave me one<br>hundred forty thousand dollars to buy a<br>fancy machine it takes pictures of<br>people's eyes and tell me about them the<br>layering of the move self along the<br>river the idea is that if you've got two<br>layers of pure numbers fewer layers you<br>are very same here at the Juniper swords<br>gamma Trek right so that's an easy to<br>invest it's not only that we have open<br>people up cost a bit of money the boy<br>date date is going to be invaluable<br>right away three times so we can we<br>possibly know it's really hard to get<br>money for equipment you don't get some<br>thunder I don't pay for equipment you've<br>got to get it from your post institution<br>that course everyone wants something and<br>money doesn't doesn't grow on trees so<br>any will add some of its equipment new<br>equipment it would really disparate it<br>was painted by the promises product<br>writers 500 million like positive money<br>400 whistle years ago to research and so<br>a lot of equipment was coming off by<br>they dream like a portly certainly<br>explicate so we we know our members<br>already so when we for example do the<br>above dresses now we can quickly check<br>that these things over than the rated<br>except with seven use age propagating<br>anomalous bindings you know there's<br>something wrong with our assistance of<br>accurate approach using data rather than<br>just observing that individuals we now<br>receive negative previously helped out<br>they can do that in real time in real<br>time you know every three weeks in a<br>look to make sure thing about edging<br>would expect so there's all sorts of<br>ways of making sure that they<br>requisitions high quality getting you do<br>a let's set the timer I was going to say<br>fitting it in one on time page but it's<br>actually quite fortuitous and so much<br>replacement one front of face making<br>sure world cup on the same father right<br>to the whole box and need people I told<br>about five routes anything again with<br>the old the silver that's perfect those<br>aged aging with the space from the space<br>vehicle okay all get on the same page<br>will do that from can you want to be<br>a year this specific company that did<br>that enlightening edited a lot of micro<br>tymberlee why could everyone together<br>and start to acculturate how you think<br>about analyzing the data than you say<br>because the special set of clicks or<br>next or approaches that people need to<br>learn and it's not soft everything<br>possible matter guy from this design<br>into this space hard one man problems we<br>want to share that around my career and<br>of course we're it's not analyzing stuff<br>long before we finished will have fifty<br>or sixty seven dative ideas is that<br>telling me not to beautifully I'm gonna<br>spit in my throat I realize it times up<br>so we can start runnin Ellison in other<br>words we will noble to come out 2020 and<br>we're like the special magnetic so by do<br>really amazing alright once we stopped<br>on that part by the way we know that<br>funny around we try and make them go<br>away be involved in these things sort of<br>a reputation which we work and in<br>Oakland si would make the chronic<br>the way we try under by ourselves to try<br>and shoot over jump not solid so when<br>someone out there in the room what's<br>there to go there another not by the<br>women what making an Olympic diver who<br>directed ENIAC reckoners we're making do<br>this that you know that what we've<br>presented to the world is rock salt<br>we're not kidding about things we don't<br>think our name in lights like Russia<br>didn't publish something quite obvious<br>what you serve and that seems quite<br>old-fashioned okay so this is the my<br>first question from the you may be any<br>more that will be proven after how do we<br>send for their reception and Bayern one<br>we get out of that international<br>collaborations we did this is an<br>international consortium we've got two<br>very long-term 383 long-term players<br>1,000 tons even up and see is benefit<br>master intended for about 20 years and<br>theory along with make sure our KC<br>faithful to in America also an<br>appointment in King's College in London<br>so we can draw on the metal links to<br>direct leads with key players to Europe<br>into mistakes that's good yes it is the<br>cutting edge believe it a lot is not<br>solid you need people on your team for<br>the world including in place who are<br>living out there in the world when the<br>cutting edge may be doing recognizes<br>engages hearing the stuff easily fair<br>we've got these healthy very talented<br>overseas I've met a lot just walking<br>past them being told started it's<br>amazing sometimes the gulf between what<br>the chips are here is the muck to turn<br>over there is a lot more papers but you<br>need to be the limit to the world of<br>science and that's what these people can<br>bring not only that foot link which is<br>here we make family people who<br>apparently invested from the long-term<br>career committed to the study who have<br>the study best interest you don't have<br>to be focused it could be supper brief<br>but the for the sovereignty or self<br>motivation study or being the effects<br>they feel also I mean wouldn't it windy<br>this remember when you live in working<br>at Ivy League university you get a<br>really good proper students connected<br>post-ops wanted a completely attitude<br>for example so you can set up almost oh<br>and can prove your battery life<br>conservation<br>we're not right most of foot to live on<br>hanging out places is really bad because<br>people individuals come in the summer<br>time and once you've got a few years<br>over on the clock you're illiterate<br>managing and directing rather than doing<br>the grunt work right so we accept that<br>in other words God's how to aggressively<br>and this one of the objective value we<br>can tap into some of the vision brains<br>in the world for these countries not<br>really perfect people to zero to that<br>are just in line at the port I could<br>then also we have painful okay young<br>makes the mobile walking around place is<br>all that formal stuff that goes on but<br>the really interesting stuff at the<br>theater seizures the stuff that is<br>whispered either a conferences clearly<br>this or around the water cooler within<br>very shots right I'm thinking of what I<br>noticed this did you know about what can<br>you tell me about India the scene<br>all right so heading an overseas<br>initiative and bring those fresh<br>insights in real time to a sphere and<br>and cultural differences do it these<br>elders are different on Australia's<br>travel difficulty nailing all<br>difficulties<br>bricks bricks abilities alright so<br>you've got to manage nice alright Doug<br>Leier being in charge of something like<br>this is not me up inside here click on<br>the garden and what you want to do the<br>classic stuff is what doesn't that pivot<br>would seem to be yawning and we can go<br>right so you can't get busted by people<br>of big egos activities for their<br>rightful son you gave one to some not so<br>you do it accounting area so biggie is<br>my temple imagine Diego now now the<br>notebook there's a different medicine<br>alright because people politics every<br>sphere of life confidences make quite<br>challenging new also situation you both<br>big can adapt as opposed to our option<br>is comes thinking what's going on and<br>what the Mike what the right guidance<br>might look like will be okay and which<br>is the high fall out rights and good<br>sisters good start but relationships Wow<br>rocket science a so what is it well<br>fundamentally is a little study - its<br>Britt that unbelievably station rid of<br>our goodwill with existence River 2,000<br>people independent like that ahead lira<br>people beginning in the world if we<br>started that really I don't think this<br>would be achieved 45 you later this will<br>be dead before you repay it began I<br>remember the jingles God's own country<br>right there infinity for softer kinder<br>gentler<br>people live right that's the beginning<br>of every time we see a study members we<br>have a task of strengthening that<br>commitment will screw up right so<br>I'll get to some more specifics about<br>how that can go here on that's it<br>what we have here is food systems<br>logical very in the existence of a lot<br>of information on that people have being<br>written it and we're they're brilliantly<br>feminine and Rex art and a number of<br>them in here today so we pick really<br>with probably flour so starting with<br>tomorrow dude real late all they're<br>really thinking on and selecting you<br>cluster at EQ all right<br>social intuition to give a about the<br>component please so we're looking for<br>people with social intuition you can<br>relate to all walks of life possessor of<br>30 lives without being judgmental being<br>respectful with kindness with the<br>ability to do things on the hood because<br>we can give them some are for strippers<br>suffers is that how you do things but<br>human beings will only build buffer to<br>all the time so we what a fantastic<br>start<br>I think every time we do this we get a<br>fantastic stuff and this keeps it<br>together a bit of like all the guys then<br>write something that the Olympics the<br>best deal I'm sure you know I could see<br>why I said that<br>what does seem to be the victim program<br>really great food and they are the<br>coalface not me not other people<br>research manager or data militants if<br>these four people do the interviews and<br>does a literal one sound no one better<br>film one hangover one whatever can begin<br>the rot and you'll see 95 come down to<br>91 and 83 and I'll go off because people<br>talk to each other publicly so how do<br>the Fisher's now who know what they're<br>doing plaintiff Italian quality issue<br>throughout supported do the job which is<br>a very human one interacting with a<br>human being<br>ask them also think we really find a<br>difference that as well as vision and<br>all sorts of life so solitary movie is<br>the virtual common sense the<br>relationships are very important I think<br>of a relationship with studying them as<br>being the most important thing in a<br>hospital I'm not talking about being<br>I've never given being a speaker that<br>we've met again I'm talking about us<br>when we had but for do good things what<br>they give it get us through the eight<br>hours plus and the shelling rather than<br>be missed if you'd answer that riddle<br>from period at the time their enzymatic<br>what that contributed is made a<br>difference they will take care of it I<br>feel very trapped and I've helped others<br>and it's a primal emotion and I get much<br>in return apart from our gratitude I<br>mean in one of series of curricula fly<br>on deck from Peru right London when they<br>were 21 but not a kettle class eat<br>some of them recently right right so<br>they do it because they believe it will<br>help us so what we do it's how to do it<br>so it's a natural thing and I think you<br>know people can read each other pretty<br>well and so the study has no idea that<br>we respect them and we value news there<br>are millions component parts of that<br>being real pretty and we think very hard<br>about how to achieve it and we never<br>risk or memos<br>we've always keep trying to be better<br>and we make mistakes that we try and<br>learn and if there's a thing of being a<br>faux pas I will have some of the realest<br>as people love honesty you don't forgive<br>you a lot if you're honest if you try<br>alright an excellent season way well I<br>start from 100 I'm not limited a lot way<br>down by not going to the sarony because<br>I've been there and now it can be done<br>so I start on my hunt we look if<br>anything<br>everyone's budget as you can get another<br>single person apparently and we say<br>right fit the topic in anywhere life<br>cricket and then we'll get 50 now when<br>you get 400 citrus off that if you could<br>bit extra 0 we see kebab better I shall<br>be a name is much much higher much love<br>but we get bit by the puppet right so<br>you super size 5<br>and you strive hard addicted and when<br>people say you can't do that book<br>exactly where you go in blind services<br>consent remember others is though the<br>really complicated model that we guides<br>us all right that was Phil's belief I<br>bought into that 100% doing unto others<br>it's very frightening be the same during<br>it is bloody hard the makes you want to<br>put itself in many other people's shoes<br>and will not to slip along a road food<br>walk for a week or two in their shoes<br>and understand that their world was life<br>they think about whether we should be<br>doing X or Y lift FX committees are<br>great I love one people see them as a<br>hurdle I love it because they can go if<br>they Charlie just like a really<br>probation no I can one example<br>ace 2015 certainly DNA about event with<br>PD program appropriate assessment on<br>fundamentally the she was being used and<br>people are sounded but coming to say<br>that people's they're gonna climate it<br>was a good person a reasonable person<br>and and this was in the context of<br>especially blood a lot less family but<br>the DNA and it became very obvious<br>immediately<br>almost that other study members were<br>introduced into existence of one of the<br>police car and that'll affect the boxy<br>and not a problem a problem that I would<br>suddenly by virtue of my neutral and<br>accurate and objective response set up a<br>careers of situation in a prison cell<br>that they should try and get our explain<br>well with injuries and we became the<br>dynamic assessment is a genuine<br>impression supplication depression<br>ominous while results are going and when<br>I have these types of person say we<br>don't agree with your bottom line right<br>lot of big deals you want to change your<br>mind<br>either way of doing a date and what it<br>taught the Bible so forget it now the<br>clothes incredibly bright I'm a civilian<br>this could have been a really clearly<br>strategist but we ended up getting more<br>people giving blood prepared notation<br>then we would have normal my motherhood<br>done the last time cuz I'm not quite I'm<br>not done that I'm not mad to begin it<br>was a genuine attempt by me with Noah<br>watching novel not going to do the right<br>thing recycle<br>what would I like that's what we'll see<br>through the rough science that's a<br>Rebecca that way of thinking that only<br>the third nothing fancy about that but<br>you got a<br>this belt in it the whole time a vehicle<br>screams all sorts of challenges in this<br>case you've got people who at 45-degree<br>the balance and early signs of that<br>diseases that they were respected at<br>least these I mentioned earlier<br>what are we do we hit them up we have a<br>very clear contact about 30 minutes will<br>intervene of an alliance and I think<br>this is one woman's interest to<br>themselves of Internet affect others<br>this was the things of a time of the<br>main challenge of concern is slightly<br>edgy problems expression to a bizarre<br>divine I will kill myself and if you<br>have I'm going to go and eat my water or<br>my time but as people very important<br>that the readers language and the salt<br>water to include physical health<br>problems so we have a attrition see I've<br>crucial not just a moment clinical<br>catfishes Michael or haven't really<br>unemployed opinion of the you are about<br>their ticket Agra peda you don't cut a<br>bit for the contemplated systolic at<br>Loyola and that number is given to us by<br>subscribing<br>like all LED and that and they disaster<br>to in good conscience know that we're<br>doing the work America Universal we're<br>not letting anyone walk out of that<br>their situation and existing situation<br>and go on unknowingly with a risk<br>serious not them and they're not gonna<br>drop dead of a heart attack tomorrow but<br>what would you do accident they need to<br>go up in GP and get this checked out<br>because on the day you came that's a<br>movie pieces all right that will change<br>the time as we need more biological and<br>more decision tonight very citizen all<br>right so may ten or five balance now and<br>I'm almost here they've been making the<br>effects of another question either so we<br>made a mistake you government bubble yes<br>enlightening Co for politicians and<br>property matters in fear of a couple of<br>examples and so ice on a panel that<br>wrote a report about how they should fix<br>the shifts and the way to do that is a<br>rented solution completely forget about<br>the old system it's broken<br>this started a new ministry give it a<br>new mandate a new way of operating<br>so the six of us on that panel and I see<br>academic food right so I'm the one<br>that's spoke about evidence either<br>speculative it's one of these stuff<br>because I put<br>to probe your next sentence but that was<br>a very peaceful employee to that process<br>of data to the biggest chain of such<br>respect for 45 years according to the<br>Sydney victim Minister Sajjan Arthur so<br>that was there what about outside Museum<br>last part of a junket that went to<br>European Union it's just the week before<br>bricks led by feminists it was very<br>pleased to be in Brussels and and we<br>sold museums integrated data<br>infrastructure and the social investment<br>paradigms that surround there is a<br>unique opportunity to Europe to learn<br>something about placing staff who make<br>social policies the believe study and<br>its language to mess about the human<br>planet at the skillet that they seem to<br>were originally anyway had been through<br>a bilateral relationship the European<br>Union any Museum fund by the Prime<br>Minister Livia this year those are nice<br>politicians not because of Barry Michael<br>was in international piracy<br>bilateral relationship celerity<br>legitimate conversation just was one<br>other partner doesn't always have to be<br>silent able to be my group social sector<br>facto cyber visors and this is linked<br>directly stuff thank you through<br>variable with social sector budget bit<br>for your mentoring basis and we may know<br>that so we gonna know that doesn't we're<br>not always listened to that we can be<br>influential bit of course I'm bringing<br>what I'm open to these study into the<br>context of what we do is so relevant a<br>New Zealand situation and policy<br>formation and in social conditions<br>paradigm is<br>we talked about in Wellington you<br>identify those most at risk with a long<br>set of cost and misery<br>exactly socially would that respect and<br>respectful and complete other people<br>that look similar on the surface but<br>don't have that long risk profile even<br>to be remember all the money in the<br>world and those people with the past for<br>liabilities of the court and you do the<br>people then go pass the bill and often<br>political system because that to time<br>you give them the roles or into the<br>reduce across on society and it's a ship<br>reduce suffering for feckless<br>if anything like the best light course<br>best to the minister and I'm involved<br>for a number of conversations right now<br>which may have real benefits if it goes<br>election has to be done for the<br>population in terms of military that one<br>with the vehicle to very early that 22c<br>in the population for whatever we often<br>know called narrow a struggle and need a<br>handout for yes all about us all of our<br>economy degraded three near impossible<br>to measure impact in individual sittings<br>and they're convenient and then people I<br>will ever look right now but this are<br>the skin<br>you see anything well threats to<br>advancing recipe peter farrelly keep a<br>call here as we get more and more<br>interesting data becoming apparent I<br>believe we can stick to a naughty<br>carried away with the latest their fear<br>issue<br>everything has to be something getting<br>away of doing the right thing by<br>precision participants we might live<br>there and any field aware changing<br>landscape the galaxy journal killings<br>are where we publish our information<br>they don't have our data now my contact<br>with our concept with leggings has no<br>other platform people who leaves for the<br>electives in the dragon basically was<br>like reassurance finders are not going<br>to give us money anymore and let's be<br>good degree away so you see this is this<br>is a train wreck coming this is a real<br>question and the reasons they agreed to<br>doing this I put the shearing<br>transparently reproduce observables are<br>on purpose used to say the journals of<br>safe places will abate is to say that<br>firmly 450k in the Cygnet revenue<br>deployment in lies set that thing in the<br>second some engagement process in front<br>of work was on through right now I have<br>a future one one future you need to<br>nature now playing here the young the<br>curve the next generation including<br>leadership but as the person in this<br>room who I think should be the next<br>derivative and<br>by Motel the weather might be my canvas<br>with it my responsibility is to ensure<br>that she it's all the experiences<br>exposed she needs to be able to step up<br>in the park they have all the other team<br>lead researchers they need to be<br>thinking that we should replace it I put<br>the load my clinical is happy month-<br>what's your transition situation and<br>since you don't expect somebody 54 and<br>I'm thinking about my successor but<br>honestly I may discern the game for much<br>longer looks I don't know us but on what<br>thinking like that I'm not I'm looking<br>to speak about different eight which<br>they are you know until in mine and it's<br>good thinking about this it's Delia it's<br>not about academic competency or EQ or<br>whether it's about getting us that this<br>is an our National Commission for Palmer<br>you need a person's of right now so<br>we'll put the some intuition of the<br>epidemic special interest and she's<br>but they say I did there<br>right honey balls are a problem and just<br>to cut through this philanthropies an<br>optional museum distort potency so what<br>have I done this is how you say that<br>becoming you guys sit around thinking<br>that of talking to people to you guys<br>become part of itself or the coach years<br>of public unless you just want to raise<br>money for private all right like at<br>first hands really get my own experience<br>what we make my own wonder that I want<br>is shoe decision for enemy if that's<br>worth pursuing my masquerade as Prime<br>Minister the Grippit work with running<br>metric major race half a million bucks<br>okay lovely like the race running after<br>the word different people so that's how<br>relieved I got in safe billeted<br>worthless elimination who saw the series<br>why mine you like it yeah it great<br>slighted a lot of other people I've had<br>people come up to me in airports and<br>take out a person's this year in<br>maritime come up to be in a commercial<br>plane sure your regardless the replies<br>and I thought rather being that's a good<br>thing<br>anything to pursue to family in very<br>guarantee is how about a stuff and<br>repair in history that was now being<br>fitted up in the Adamic as a result of<br>them and watch that stuff they've done<br>series so somehow not exceeded we were<br>didn't like people to talk about how one<br>and absolutely more with music on the<br>wolf and nectar the whole thing well<br>done is about trust the study members<br>are it if we treat them well strengthen<br>that bond of drums that official trust<br>I haven't talked about what they tell us<br>it's unbelievable<br>they tell us in a godly that I give a<br>certain vanilla human being adapted<br>right they trust us more responsive<br>elevated we live up to it and you need<br>to be everyone with them with respect<br>that cross leg back<br>the man bit of a general interest<br>pundants lie mantis critics tick as one<br>thousand people by sufficiently desire</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
