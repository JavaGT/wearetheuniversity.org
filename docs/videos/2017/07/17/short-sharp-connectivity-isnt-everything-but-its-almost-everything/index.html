From toddlers with tablets and texting teens to smartphone addicts and the internet of things, we are increasingly able to be connected anytime or anywhere. But, ubiquitous and near-constant connectivity also comes with a price of fragmented attention, blurred work/non-work boundaries, and even (ironically) social isolation.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

you've<br>had big days and we will try to keep<br>this a short sharp presentation the<br>short part is I'm kind of a short guy<br>and the sharp part is going to come from<br>the conversations that we hope to engage<br>with you in the table as Ivan said this<br>room is where as set up and designed for<br>group work it is also nice to see of<br>students that I've taught over the years<br>and despite my just off the boat accent<br>and in January I will have been in New<br>Zealand for 25 years believe it or not<br>but we do speak American and home to<br>preserve our culture so we're going to<br>talk about connectivity which is<br>something I've spent a fair amount of<br>time and as if - we didn't need more<br>press than the New Zealand Herald if you<br>didn't see it on the weekend talked<br>about smart smart machines is New<br>Zealand ready for artificial<br>intelligence that was a nice lead up to<br>what we're going to talk about I do<br>wanted to focus on a few things one is<br>smartphones and connected technologies<br>media etc everyone's an expert in that<br>area it's not me for sure but that is<br>actually one of the areas I've done<br>research on so we'll talk a little bit<br>about our research I want to talk about<br>artificial intelligence and I want to<br>talk a little bit about the Internet of<br>Things these have all been very popular<br>topics in the press and so in some ways<br>I'm not going to tell you too much new<br>but I hope that we can maybe look at<br>them from different perspectives<br>different angles perhaps and introduce<br>some new thinking and I hope again that<br>in your conversations you'll come away<br>with some cause and some different<br>perspectives the other day I was giving<br>a similar talk to my I now teach in our<br>business master's program it's taught in<br>the MBA for a long time but our business<br>masters is a professional degree for<br>international students and domestic<br>students large classes a hundred<br>students again in this kind of work<br>environment and they're very good<br>students I have to say and so and I<br>asked them at the beginning of the<br>activity lecture what their relationship<br>was like with their smartphones and one<br>the first person put up her hand and<br>said a hundred percent so and then I<br>said how many of you and they pretty<br>much were all in the hundred percent<br>camp so for a lot of people and those<br>digital natives digital technology and<br>phones etc is just the way things are<br>done and we've known for a long time<br>that humans bond with technologies that<br>human adapt around technologies the<br>socio technical field has been around<br>since coal mines in Britain in the 50 so<br>we know a lot about technology and<br>nowadays we call that the socio material<br>school because again the merging of the<br>device with our human wants and desires<br>etc is getting closer and closer and<br>that again brings us to this notion of<br>sensing technologies and artificial<br>intelligence that comes along with the<br>machine we also think about keeping some<br>distance between us and the technology<br>and we some of us might remember the<br>concept of work/life boundaries in<br>Silicon Valley at least they talk about<br>work/life integration there's no<br>pretense that we would separate these<br>things I'm not saying that we shouldn't<br>try to keep the boundaries but the<br>boundaries are getting harder and harder<br>to maintain and it's certainly one of<br>the new frontiers and we have problems<br>like this just the fact that we're<br>handling screens all the time has been<br>articulated again in neuroscience there<br>are some issues around just being around<br>screen so much aside from whatever else<br>they can do for us what we know too is<br>that in going back to the work<br>environment we know that a couple of<br>things about these figures here and I'm<br>not going to present that many<br>statistics or whatever but the the first<br>point is that for most of us it's<br>normalized we consider information heavy<br>loads or information overload as part of<br>work almost so it's a rare day almost<br>when we think that we don't have lots of<br>emails lots of unanswered communication<br>etc so that's one thing to notice it's<br>become quite normal another<br>thing and Steve Barley's work here is<br>interesting they found it and you might<br>find this to be true you run into<br>someone and and their their their<br>indicator for how busy or important they<br>are is how many emails they have so we<br>use email as a proxy as it were for<br>busyness and hectic stress lots of<br>things there are lots of things that we<br>do that are not emailed but email seems<br>to symbolize how how much is going on in<br>our lives although the good news is the<br>email has actually been in decline for a<br>few years so you might not notice in<br>your inboxes but statistically worldwide<br>and again there's a whole generation of<br>digital natives who actually don't like<br>email and I'm not sure exactly what's<br>going to happen eventually they're not<br>going to want to use it because it's not<br>their preferred medium at all and again<br>what's that<br>WeChat there are a lot of better<br>platforms out there believe it or not so<br>my colleagues and I started looking at<br>this issue and actually originally my<br>first interest around the turn of the<br>century was not connectivity at that<br>point but New Zealand's isolation from<br>the world use you might remember the<br>first tech comm bubble had come and gone<br>and we we were a lot of hand-wringing<br>about missing out on the technology and<br>I was actually wondering that realizing<br>that even with the internet which was<br>there and worldwide web we could<br>possibly be struggling with this idea of<br>distance and isolation so my first<br>theorizing was around isolation but one<br>day after a seminar one of my then<br>students and now colleagues said well<br>draw you know isolations a new zealand's<br>problem connectivity is everyone's issue<br>and that was a million-dollar moment so<br>that that was a great switch and so I<br>looked at the more general issue around<br>connectivity but we were looking at some<br>hypo conditions of not having enough but<br>quickly of course you realize there's<br>often too much connectivity and in this<br>model we are concerned with what's the<br>right amount the requisite sufficient<br>and then this possible state of flow<br>where things are about right we have<br>just enough information and not too much<br>too<br>work with so one of the studies that I<br>joined it was a blackberry study so of<br>course this was another phase where<br>people are coming to terms with and<br>Blackberry questions remember it didn't<br>really do much it didn't do video the<br>things it didn't do was a long list but<br>it did do email very well and people<br>were addicted to email and addicted to<br>these devices and they were very good<br>devices they sadly quit making them just<br>a few weeks ago so the era has now<br>passed but they were really cool devices<br>but we found these were merchant bankers<br>in France and Australia and we found as<br>was mentioned sort of categories or<br>types and you might see that all I see<br>I'm kind of this person so on the left<br>you have the person who has those strong<br>boundaries as clear delineations and<br>maybe it's time five o'clock six o'clock<br>in the evening<br>maybe it's devices maybe it's just<br>making those clear distinctions between<br>work and non-work on the far end you did<br>have the CrackBerry addicts and<br>workaholism and of course the<br>dysfunction of being always distracted<br>too driven by the devices and then this<br>kind of functional middle engagement<br>where the device was doing its job and<br>people were able to communicate but<br>managed it somewhat and more recently we<br>have a team that is quite global there's<br>a German entrepreneur that's based a<br>companies based in Singapore the print<br>the programming is done in Hyderabad and<br>Bangalore in India and the intellectual<br>the academics are here in New Zealand<br>and what we've been doing now in the<br>last two years is to built an analytic<br>engine that actually measures people's<br>quantity of bought and volume of emails<br>Facebook and other social media LinkedIn<br>media and we do this by actually<br>counting their mails coming through and<br>then we survey them on their States or<br>psychological states so it's quite an<br>involved study but it's been<br>testing and our interest is to identify<br>people's responses to media and to have<br>a dashboard to feed it back to them as<br>well as understanding their relationship<br>to our theory so that's what we've been<br>doing in this study and as was mentioned<br>I mean in practice the the thing that we<br>have to we're trying to do is trying to<br>understand how to optimize this<br>connective flow and manage it so that we<br>can have the attention necessary and I<br>often say whether it's my students or<br>two managers you know if you're still<br>having meetings where you're just<br>pouring information on people that's a<br>huge waste of time and my students<br>frankly have taught me that time is for<br>some reason more and more precious more<br>and more rare and to waste their time by<br>just giving them information is just<br>that I think when humans are together we<br>should be in conversation we should be<br>making decisions and we should be doing<br>things that are much higher level than<br>just reading off minutes or sharing<br>information and so I think that what we<br>have to do is realize that in the<br>connective moment that maybe not so bad<br>if we're scanning emails or getting<br>information that way or scouting around<br>on the web but when we're together what<br>do we do with that time I think that's<br>one of the things we have to find out<br>how to do and the other thing we found<br>in these studies is that autonomy the<br>ability to be independent is somewhat<br>paradoxical so Melissa mazmanian and<br>colleagues have found that if you ask<br>people who use a heavy smartphone users<br>they actually feel quite liberated they<br>feel quite freed up because they can do<br>things at their own timing and in with<br>freedom in an actual fact they're<br>actually more wedded doing more work at<br>the same time so it's a paradox they're<br>actually more committed to work they're<br>doing emails while they're waiting for<br>kids coming out of school etc so in some<br>senses are working more but the sense of<br>liberation and freedom is also there so<br>academics don't usually give simple<br>rules but why not there is that this is<br>a summary of again not this is not our<br>research but what I've gleaned from just<br>being around this area for a while and<br>others who specialize in it one is that<br>is in the brain science field you<br>probably have heard of this that<br>basically now people are advising you to<br>get away from the screens a half hour an<br>hour spend Hanson who's a resilience<br>specialist he's now saying two hours<br>before bedtime now that's a big ass for<br>most kids and most adults frankly but<br>basically the point is if you can get<br>away from the screens and this is all<br>screens not just smartphones of TVs etc<br>and has to do with the way our brain<br>processes information and the part of<br>the brain that gets involved when we're<br>doing screen work the cheater thing that<br>I do I've learned is that if you read<br>for as little as 15 or 20 minutes after<br>watching TV or using screens it actually<br>brings the brain activity into the<br>frontal cortex and you're good you<br>should be able to sleep after that the<br>other thing is that in general email is<br>not just your problem it's probably a<br>collective problem it's a problem of the<br>people you're interacting with and those<br>behaviors so usually when people<br>complain about email it's because they<br>have a corporate culture of covering<br>their ass or copying everyone on the<br>planet and frankly these are just bad<br>habits they can be broken and the big<br>corporations are the worst if I if I at<br>least in New Zealand if I participants<br>and they tell me where they work and<br>they say email it you'd be surprised how<br>much that's still going on so you need<br>to have a conversation about what is the<br>right way to communicate with each other<br>and you can do it certainly in small<br>teams it takes a little more courage to<br>do it at the corporate level but<br>something I think we can do and again if<br>you ask the younger members of the team<br>the price say you know they'll pick<br>other media they want to use so one<br>thing - is that better technology does<br>not actually contribute to hyper<br>connectivity because one of our<br>hypotheses was that the more the<br>technology we have the quicker faster<br>better without<br>to contribute to this state of hyper<br>connectivity and surprisingly it doesn't<br>it does contribute to autonomy or agency<br>or freedom of choice which is a good<br>thing and so the biggest offsets<br>hyper-connectivity is autonomy or choice<br>of when and how I'm in touch with you<br>and technology actually doesn't<br>complicate the picture so we one<br>headline I guess would be if you've got<br>too much email don't blame your<br>smartphone it's other issues going on<br>the other sort of way is to look at it<br>philosophically and again at all ages I<br>think we need to think well what what's<br>my position on this it's like having a<br>philosophy of HR versus a bunch of<br>policies so and one book on this is<br>essentialism which I'll turn to in a<br>second the other thing is to practice<br>simply practice if you're interested in<br>it go a day go an hour go a week or<br>whatever disconnected again wonderful<br>there are a couple books on might be<br>useful and easy reading one is called<br>Hamlet's blackberry which I'd recommend<br>and even though it sounds old it's quite<br>a good read and also this book<br>essentialism is helpful if you really do<br>worry about getting things done and<br>unlike most getting things done books<br>like time management books they have the<br>refreshing approach of saying it's not<br>about getting more done it's about doing<br>the main thing and in doing less and<br>LinkedIn is a big big subscriber to this<br>and you think about a company that's<br>growing like crazy they've got a million<br>things on the mind you they own there's<br>you own the space or envy ability but<br>they're practicing this to trying to do<br>it and one thing I do is when I have I<br>have an old fashioned to-do list and<br>I've just taken two at the top of the<br>page whether it's a week or fortnight or<br>whatever I write the main thing because<br>sometimes I forget whether it's getting<br>my course ready to be taught or doing<br>collecting data or whatever it is it<br>that helps me remember this is the main<br>thing don't do all these little trivia<br>things do the main thing and hell<br>me kind of state four on purpose so<br>that's the technology in our hands now<br>let's think about work<br>what is human work so we know of course<br>about cognitive intelligence this is<br>what I'm sort of playing around with in<br>terms of types of intelligence and and<br>we know about that we know about<br>emotional intelligence and it's<br>important I would suggest to that<br>there's a body intelligence and being in<br>touch in terms of physical resilience<br>and of course we're aware of social<br>intelligence the idea of networks and<br>the power of others to help us in<br>various ways but I think the new<br>frontier here and this kind of comes<br>back to the Harold point is how do we<br>interact with these machines that are<br>now around us on us at something day in<br>us how do we as humans relate even as<br>machines get closer and closer to our<br>understanding of the world and again<br>there are all kinds of anecdotes you've<br>probably run into this I remember the<br>first time I used Apple Maps a few years<br>ago you remembered had some glitches and<br>I was driving from San Francisco San<br>Francisco out to visit one of my<br>students who is at University of<br>California Merced now if you've ever<br>been to Merced California it's way out<br>in the San Joaquin Valley it's kind of<br>basically really isolated out in farm<br>country so I'm driving them follow the<br>maps follow the maps in this great day<br>to drive in California it's all going<br>very well big highways big cars and<br>stuff and the next thing you know I keep<br>following a snap and I'm right in the<br>middle of just irrigated cabbage farms<br>for miles I couldn't see anything else<br>and it says you have arrived and I<br>thought surely Merced is bigger than<br>this it's got to be bigger than this and<br>it was just dead wrong and I had no way<br>of knowing but I was trusting it I mean<br>that little thing takes me everywhere<br>and we have students actually because<br>our international students one woman<br>actually told me she couldn't get home<br>she got lost and couldn't get home<br>because her battery died on her phone I<br>said geez in Auckland she goes yeah<br>everything in<br>who looks the same I thought well I<br>never thought of it that way it looks<br>very unique to me but then you know I<br>guess it all looks different to me tall<br>it's the same to her and once the phone<br>died she couldn't get home but that's<br>how dependent we are becoming so that's<br>one one sort of element this and the<br>other side of this of course is that the<br>machines are out to get us and take our<br>jobs and this of course is a big<br>headline if you haven't seen this<br>headline this year you haven't been<br>reading the papers much so it's very<br>popular it's getting a lot of press all<br>over the place and if you want to know<br>and impress your peers and co-workers<br>that cut most of that almost everything<br>those headlines comes from one of these<br>two books and mostly the second Machine<br>Age I consider the second Machine Age to<br>be the good to great for this decade I<br>always try to pick out the one business<br>book that makes the biggest difference<br>in a decade and it would have to I think<br>be this book because you've heard<br>everything from the machines taking our<br>jobs to the living wages in their<br>winner-take-all economics there's a<br>whole lot of those concepts that are<br>wrapped up in this book and it's a very<br>good read it's written by economist at<br>MIT and they're very good at what they<br>do and they paint a good picture of this<br>reality so that's kind of where that<br>automation 2.0 materials coming from the<br>other books written by Nicholas Carr and<br>Nick is a journalist he wrote a book<br>called the shallows which is about<br>brains and screens etc but if you're<br>interested in aviation or flying it's<br>got a great little potted history of<br>automated flight and it's fascinating<br>from the first people flying planes in<br>the 20s out of the cockpit which is kind<br>of interesting and tragically in that<br>book they talk about again the horrible<br>mistakes that can be made with machines<br>when the Airbus went down over the<br>Atlantic a few years ago when they've<br>done now they've done the analysis<br>they've worked it out that a few years<br>ago<br>Boeing and Airbus had choices to make<br>around the technology they've as you<br>might imagine no one's actually pulled a<br>yoke and pulled a cable for many years<br>that all the controls in the plane have<br>been digital and electronic for many<br>years but Airbus took the yoke out of<br>the pilot cockpit and they have just a<br>little tiny hand control thing on the<br>console by the hand of the pilot and<br>when that plane got into trouble one<br>pilot very intuitively but very wrongly<br>pulled the plane up and it stalled and<br>the analysis is that if any two pilots<br>or three pilots in a cockpit would have<br>seen the yoke going up like that there's<br>no way they would have tolerated they<br>would have into it they would have known<br>that was the wrong move but they didn't<br>see it it was being done by hand or<br>finger out of sight and there was no<br>visual cue to the error and there is<br>this whole problem about pilots not<br>being able to land planes as well as<br>possible because you know a good<br>airplane they only really need to touch<br>the controls two or three minutes on a<br>whole trip to LA there's not much that<br>plane can do pretty much everything<br>itself but again it's that question of<br>how much then does a pilot do and need<br>to do the other scenario he'd get works<br>through very well if you're in health is<br>the idea of diagnosis and Watson in<br>particular the IBM's machine and if you<br>think about it you go to your GP and<br>you've got this niggle and this little<br>problem and they've seen three and<br>twenty years or maybe they've seen<br>twenty Watson has seen every case ever<br>published Watson has seen a million<br>cases of your knee or your ankle or your<br>problem and Watson is going to come up<br>with a diagnosis that frankly is better<br>than any GP can come up with and who<br>you're going to go with right so this is<br>the one issue and then there's<br>electronic medical records etc so these<br>are some of the frontier sort of<br>questions and issues I was talking some<br>nurses not long ago at the med school<br>and I said the baby boomers in<br>particular are going to be totally into<br>this because we're going to be basically<br>using our iPads for meta<br>and right up to the point where it's all<br>over we're just going to for that last<br>couple minutes we're going to want some<br>good human bedside manner because we've<br>given up finally on Google and taking in<br>information that way and I think that<br>that's a frontier for those professions<br>so just a review automation 1.0 is about<br>machines making stuff and taking jobs<br>away from people who use the Bang &amp;<br>Clank things around automation 2.0 is a<br>different sort of angle to it and this<br>is why the concern and the headlines are<br>such compelling reading is that these<br>are possibly the middle jobs the<br>white-collar jobs that are not coming<br>back one example is that you know we<br>meant in this very building thousands<br>and thousands of B coms with accounting<br>become accountants you need a couple<br>take them take a couple tonight in one<br>year the Dean told me we went from one<br>of the local firms in one year took<br>about 63 Beacom accountants ok the next<br>year they took about 40 graduates a<br>third less and only half of those were<br>accountants so they took 20 say 20 less<br>a third less overall and a third and<br>only one third in total of the<br>accountants why because they didn't need<br>accountants they needed consultants and<br>other things so they hired arts majors<br>and engineers etc the kind of folks you<br>hire for consulting now that's just one<br>firm but that's one year and if you're<br>in in the professional services you will<br>be feeling some of this pressure lot the<br>other way now you can all say maybe we<br>had too many lawyers anyway lots of<br>American jokes about lawyers but in<br>actual fact the law profession is the<br>same way machines can scan and do a lot<br>of pre legal work you simply need a<br>high-level advisor at the very high end<br>and so there's still some work around<br>well actually from what I've read my MBA<br>projects banks are automating as fast as<br>they can - in fact nice segue here's the<br>head of the Commonwealth Bank saying as<br>much just this year because again at<br>certain levels in banking and if you<br>think about it I mean there's concern<br>about losing bricks-and-mortar banks and<br>I grew up in a tiny town and we had a<br>little bank and still do four three<br>hundred and fifty people on how they do<br>it but on the other hand my Kiwi Bank<br>app is about as good in you know all the<br>apps are actually as good as most<br>hometown bankers it's much more handy<br>it's quick it tells me most of the<br>information I need it's incredible so<br>why do you need bankers and lawyers and<br>accountants one of the things again that<br>the authors of the second Machine Age<br>talk about it they give this idea that<br>one things about a are machine<br>intelligence is that a lot of these<br>things have been developing gradually<br>over a long time but there's this sort<br>of a tipping point and for example<br>self-driving cars another great topic of<br>great discussion but five years ago<br>people would still probably in this room<br>said nad will never happen and then<br>suddenly everyone's starting to take it<br>seriously so it does come along quickly<br>at times but this is the slide so take<br>note if you do a non routine cognitive<br>job which is what probably most of you<br>do or many of us do interesting exciting<br>the intuitive or the nuance to sort of<br>work your job growth as a job growth in<br>the u.s. that's good<br>if you do non-routine manuals so if<br>you're a barista or chef or gardener<br>you're probably seeing job growth<br>carpentry etc but if you have a routine<br>job that's either manual or cognitive<br>this is where the threat of of job loss<br>is happening so again comes to the point<br>that automation that we can take routine<br>out of manual sort of activities<br>automation where we can take what was<br>used to be intellectual sort of work<br>cognitive work is on the decline so the<br>question is are we creating enough these<br>jobs we're not going to take on the<br>tackle<br>question tonight but I think it is<br>something we need to be thinking about<br>and again something something of the<br>concerns we're seeing one of the things<br>this comes from The Economist who<br>summarized - quite a lot of this<br>summarized well this year is that no<br>matter what happens and we as educators<br>understand that going back to those<br>accountants who didn't get hired or the<br>accountants that did get hired we have<br>to accept that these changes are rapid<br>enough that we have to understand and be<br>able to switch jobs in our careers more<br>rapidly and going back to my time as an<br>outward-bound instructor I was thrilled<br>to see them say that the other thing we<br>note of our best graduates it's grit and<br>acity perseverance it's all those human<br>qualities that we want to build into our<br>students and into your workers etc so<br>these are the enduring human<br>characteristics that we all still need<br>if we're going forward and now I want to<br>just leave you with something that you<br>may not have seen or may have seen it is<br>local information it's right up the<br>street here but it gives a good idea<br>where our official intelligent might get<br>pretty pretty extraordinary stuff and<br>when mark did is he presented this at<br>TEDx in Auckland a few years ago and<br>when the audience first got the sort of<br>the field its little baby and they were<br>so impressed they started to applaud<br>loudly and the baby was frightened and<br>then instantly people stopped the<br>flooding and the baby was fine so it was<br>quite an interactive moment with us and<br>the Machine so we will see more of this<br>and again tremendous stuff is in the<br>now I want to talk a little bit about<br>the third thing so we've talked a little<br>about you and your devices talk about us<br>and machines and I want to talk about<br>everything else the Internet of Things<br>so we thought about the internet in<br>world wide web for many years as a<br>social thing basically connects people<br>and that's kind of thing I think I<br>almost sort of see it but in actual fact<br>we're kind of disappearing from this<br>world too so there's a whole internet<br>now of things always has been but this<br>is another thing we're thinking about<br>one that is the quantified self so the<br>Fitbit movement we're starting to take<br>measures of things around us and other<br>sensing devices that around us and<br>starting to feed into our world and what<br>will be possible with these again is<br>almost limitless as we start to move<br>into that the other thing we're starting<br>to see is an application a business<br>application is taking these data and<br>gamifying it so for example this is I<br>think a real application where an<br>insurance company gives you an app you<br>drive around it's able to sense what you<br>do in your car speeds quick braking etc<br>that gives it data to then feed back to<br>the insurance company to reduce your<br>rates if you do well or up your rates<br>presumably you cancel your policy I<br>guess if you if you don't do well and<br>the idea that it's gamified meaning it<br>takes<br>basically pretty banal boring data but<br>makes it more interesting because of the<br>app interface etc and we'll be seeing a<br>lot more of that I believe too in the<br>future but the Internet of Things just a<br>few numbers here again only 1% of the<br>world's things are connected but in<br>recently when the new IP addresses came<br>out there are 340 trillion trillion<br>trillion IP addresses so that every<br>toaster every car wheel everything made<br>basically can have an IP address so that<br>we are anticipating a connection of<br>things big-time 11.1 trillion dollars<br>per year of economic impact by 2025 and<br>you know this figure is created by<br>consultants because as a point one at<br>the end of it and also only about a 1%<br>of the data produced at the moment are<br>currently used so again this massive<br>amounts of room for analytics and when<br>we're doing our email analytic thing we<br>have the partners in Bangalore as I said<br>but we also have this new partner in the<br>States and I went there and they were<br>just this this sort of this big coming<br>500 people and I said what do you guys<br>do and he said we handle 6 billion<br>emails a day and there's only 5 people<br>in this company that can read them but<br>there's just completely analyzing emails<br>not that they've sent but from just<br>emails that are out there so if Amazon<br>sends you a package their analyte<br>they're analyzing what you've done with<br>it what was in it etc and completely<br>legal completely free and then they sell<br>it back to various parties so the<br>analytics game is big time this was done<br>as a summary of industry so again we're<br>seeing that obviously in some industries<br>there's quicker uptake and again your<br>industry might be a leader in this area<br>or following but again it's going to hit<br>different industries but what you will<br>notice is the overall growth in just the<br>five years span<br>and things like agriculture for example<br>are actually quite leading up to the<br>farm gate agriculture you know it's<br>measuring all sorts of things and<br>tractors and things that drive drive<br>down roads they do a lot in that field<br>as well as obviously the health field<br>etcetera shipping etc coming back to<br>health there's an awful lot of data<br>available for people and again if you<br>start taking that into our own use<br>recently a friend in our neighborhood<br>passed away of cancer and it was tragic<br>and but when the I was a very unique<br>kind of cancer and when she passed the<br>doctors here the Auckland Hospital said<br>that her husband was the foremost expert<br>in the country on that disease they did<br>there's no way they knew as much about<br>that disease as him he just made it his<br>project as you would he was very<br>dedicated to her into understanding it<br>and when she died he knew more about<br>that disease and anyone in New Zealand<br>so that reverses things that we normally<br>take for granted quite a lot now that<br>isn't the internet of things but that's<br>just the Internet of information and<br>what's possible there I did want to<br>leave you some depressing news though so<br>and this might may or may not after what<br>we've been talking about may not be that<br>tough so anyway a few things to think<br>about going forward one of the things<br>probably will not always go right and<br>maybe this is what we're talking about<br>we're as fast as we're changing and<br>evolving and getting new stuff and great<br>stuff there are going to be problems<br>with this so there are problems both at<br>infrastructure security level etc and so<br>things are not always going to go right<br>a couple examples if you haven't read it<br>again great summer reading this is both<br>one of us frightening one of the best<br>written books you've ever read but one<br>of those frightening accounts of<br>machines going completely berserk but I<br>highly recommend it's from the same<br>author who wrote the Big Short and it's<br>basically roars along like that it will<br>make you very nerve<br>about bankers and very nervous about<br>some of the technologies we've been<br>talking about security as we know is a<br>big issue we're now realizing my IT<br>friends say that you know the companies<br>it's not a question of if companies will<br>be hacked it's when and companies are<br>being hacked that we don't hear about<br>the news because they're very sort of<br>covering it up and so there's a lot of<br>security issues as well as us giving<br>over our private information about trout<br>as we move around through the through<br>life the other thing that kind of is<br>important to think about in the economic<br>space and I'm not an economist and<br>should be having a little bit bigger<br>font here if we think about some of<br>these players and this again is a phrase<br>from the second Machine Age the idea<br>that in some economies or some sectors<br>of the economy it basically gets rolled<br>up to one or two players and sometimes<br>just one player so we have this<br>winner-take-all economics where everyone<br>tries and everyone tries it in one day<br>you own everything and one example of<br>that is some of these are good examples<br>locally another example is in in some<br>sectors in the US the some local Cala<br>teas like Seattle Amazon is now<br>delivering groceries so you think about<br>well how can a bookstore basically sell<br>you bring you groceries but think of it<br>the other way what will Amazon not know<br>about you if they know what you read<br>they know what you by Christmas and they<br>sell you groceries every day of the week<br>or every week<br>I mean think of the information and the<br>you know the kind of consolidation and<br>last year at Christmas the only retailer<br>that actually made money in the US was<br>Amazon so you have this kind of<br>winner-take-all thing I just want to<br>just end up with a few hopeful slides<br>this is this is a picture taken that Tao<br>packy primary school now this is<br>actually it's hopeful with a little bit<br>scary too this is a very simple country<br>school out west not a rich school thanks<br>whoever I was taken there because it's<br>unbelievable they're on because of this<br>principle they're on their third<br>generation of 3d printer they find<br>there's so much cheaper and so much<br>better than the top of maintenance guys<br>look after the 3d printers this was a<br>glove that was it ads these<br>old-fashioned sewing machines when I was<br>in school that's what we had these son<br>with the girls had sewing machines they<br>were making analog gloves but the<br>project was about safety so the little<br>eight year olds had programmed these LED<br>lights that's what you're seeing there<br>to have different you know designs and<br>do different things they're really<br>interested in that they were taught by<br>the 11-year olds<br>how a program so the thing is it's scary<br>about this in ten years those kids are<br>going to be in these seats and what are<br>we going to do to stretch them and<br>challenge him and to understand the<br>world they come up through and give them<br>suitable additional skills that's the<br>scary part to me might not be your worry<br>but anyway that's something else to<br>think about some other good news is that<br>I do believe that as a social sort of<br>beings we will start to legitimize being<br>off line or off grid or whatever and I<br>think that will be something that will<br>evolve to where you don't apologize for<br>taking a weekend away from your<br>cellphone or something and people kind<br>but the other reminder I think in a<br>world that quickly gets curated and<br>commented on and posted is to not forget<br>to live in the world that we're living<br>right here and now because life's<br>tooling happens once no matter how fast<br>your data stream is so with that I'd<br>like to thank you and appreciate your<br>comments and your suggestions and your<br>sharing back with each other short and<br>sharp<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
