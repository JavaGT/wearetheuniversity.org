font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we found in our study in rats that fresh<br>fish oil given during pregnancy did<br>improve a major diabetes risk factor in<br>their pups but we're not recommending<br>that pregnant woman take fish oil at<br>this time and that's because we haven't<br>shown benefits in humans yet and because<br>our previous work has shown that when a<br>woman buys a fish oil supplement she<br>can't be sure that it's fresh you might<br>be surprised to know that up to one and<br>five pregnant women in New Zealand take<br>fish oil but leading it to be of benefit<br>to their health and the health of their<br>babies other studies and adults have<br>shown that fish oil may be protective<br>against diabetes so we wanted to know<br>whether giving fish oil during pregnancy<br>may be protective for their children<br>we took pregnant rats and we either feed<br>them a high-fat diet to make them<br>overweight or a standard diet and then<br>half of those rats got a fresh fish oil<br>supplement we've in assist diabetes risk<br>factors in the offspring after they had<br>grown up all the way through to<br>adulthood and what we found was that in<br>the offspring of the high-fat diet group<br>the overweight group if the mother<br>received a fresh fish oil and it<br>improved the way insulin worked in the<br>offspring and that means that it reduced<br>their risk of diabetes this is important<br>because the children of overweight<br>mothers are twice as likely to develop<br>problems like diabetes as they become<br>adults we also know that about 30% of<br>pregnant women are overweight so this is<br>leading us to design a clinical study to<br>look at the benefits of fish oil an<br>overweight pregnant woman to see if it<br>has the same protective benefits in the<br>meantime we don't recommend that<br>pregnant women take fish oil and that's<br>because of two of our previous findings<br>and the first we looked at fish oil<br>supplements available to purchase in New<br>Zealand and we found that most of them<br>were oxidized above recommended limits<br>meaning that they'd gone off and when we<br>looked at the packaging nothing written<br>on the packaging could help a person<br>work out whether the supplement they<br>wanted to buy was going to be oxidized<br>or fresh in the second study we gave a<br>highly oxidized for oil to pregnant rats<br>and what we found is that it increased<br>the number of babies who died soon after<br>birth a really dramatic finding now<br>unfortunately we don't know what the<br>safe level of oxidation is in fish oil<br>taken by pregnant woman and so in the<br>meantime we recommend that pregnant<br>women got their omega threes from<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
