technology is transforming the way banks do business, Commonwealth Bank of Australia CEO Ian Narev talks about loyalty, cost efficiencies, and the challenge of the blockchain.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the ability for technology with our help<br>to provide people with greater insight<br>confidence on things like budgeting<br>expenditure what we would generally call<br>financial literacy and financial<br>empowerment is extraordinary and at the<br>bank we had a session last week where we<br>had a couple of Harvard professors who<br>are doing research in the sort of area<br>and we were taking they're thinking<br>about how technology works and what<br>financial literacy means etcetera<br>together with our ability to use data<br>and to analyze data provide insights to<br>customers and on issues like saving up<br>for a house how much you can afford to<br>live comfortably on but still service<br>debt what you should be saving for<br>superannuation over time the ability of<br>the technology interface if it's very<br>lively together with the analytics to<br>provide real value add to customers on<br>managing their own financial<br>circumstances is extraordinary and it's<br>a classic example of where both the<br>customer including business customers<br>and the bank both benefit because it<br>means we're doing our part to help the<br>customer understand how to use finances<br>in a way which is going to maximize<br>their well-being at the same time we're<br>able to make better assessment on risk<br>management and all those sorts of things<br>so in an environment where every day<br>we're making risk decisions now clients<br>are making budgeting decisions and<br>lifestyle decisions the ability of the<br>technology interface plus the richness<br>of the data to help customers and us at<br>the same time as is really quite<br>transformational<br>like most of the technological<br>innovation we see digital currency and<br>and the distributed ledger is both a<br>threat and opportunity and in many ways<br>that's the way you do need to think<br>about it when we think about digital<br>currency specifically we first separated<br>into the distributed ledger that<br>underlying technology which clearly is<br>very powerful and the whole application<br>of the blockchain and financial services<br>is a big theme it's still the very<br>experimental phase over the next few<br>years I think there'll be a lot of talk<br>about the innovation but I think the<br>fundamental innovation at scale is<br>probably a few years out but it will<br>happen and it will transform our<br>industry because at a certain level it<br>fundamentally changes the role of the<br>intermediary and if a blockchain is<br>built out and everyone has the computing<br>power to use the blockchain you've<br>really got to think about what does that<br>mean for the intermediary in a world<br>which is increasingly on the blockchain<br>so that's sort of Part A the digital<br>currency is a slightly different<br>question because yes it's part of the<br>same blockchain question but because of<br>its nature as an application dealing<br>with currency and the nature of currency<br>and the result the role of the Reserve<br>Bank's and regulators that's actually a<br>different category aligned<br>technologically but quite different I<br>think from a regulatory perspective so<br>our view on that has follow it closely<br>experiment a little bit with it be close<br>to the people who are innovating but<br>don't try and be too predictive about<br>the world the way the world is going<br>because it's going to change and it's<br>going to end up being something quite<br>different from what we see today<br>I think the mobile wallet is already<br>getting popular and I think it's only<br>going to increase in popularity it means<br>a lot of different things to different<br>people but broadly the way that I think<br>we think about it is in any given device<br>that you've got or thing that you've got<br>whether it's a wearable or a phone or<br>whatever it might be increasingly your<br>financial needs and your transactional<br>needs are contained within that device<br>now there are again as is always the<br>case a lot of debates about what the end<br>state will be banks would like to think<br>that they are going to still have a very<br>significant role within that wallet<br>others are going to try probably and<br>push the banks back and own the customer<br>relationship and effectively relegate<br>the<br>banks position to secondary in the eyes<br>of the customer so it's one of these<br>areas which is evolving quickly a lot of<br>people believe they've got capability to<br>bring to add value to customers and<br>therefore the playing field is getting<br>very broad now we see that what we bring<br>to the table is a very deep<br>understanding of financial needs and a<br>very strong customer base so we really<br>feel like we've got a strong deck of<br>cards in the game what we need to make<br>sure those that we can execute well and<br>generally where the banks are going to<br>be challenged they've got a lot of the<br>legacy advantages but if they can't move<br>quickly and evolve quickly and innovate<br>quickly those legacy advantages can<br>pretty quickly be lost and so the mobile<br>wallet is one area that we're<br>the relationship<br>technology and loyalty is very<br>interesting because you cannot assume<br>loyalty and although over time<br>particularly in financial services a lot<br>of people will say customers have a high<br>degree of apathy etc that is changing<br>because it's easier to switch so as an<br>incumbent banking relationship for me I<br>open my first account with the ASB I<br>think when I was five I still remember<br>the number I'm still a customer so you<br>get a lot of long term loyal<br>relationships but you can't just assume<br>anymore that because I've had it since I<br>was filing than to stick with the ASB so<br>you've got to do more to earn the<br>loyalty and one of the ways you can do<br>it is by providing customers greater<br>insight into the breadth of their<br>financial services needs and into their<br>budgeting and their well-being because<br>by definite definition in doing more<br>with you will present to them a bigger<br>fuller picture of their own finances the<br>reality is that other companies who<br>aren't banks can probably do that as<br>well by just effectively owning the<br>customer interface and drawing on data<br>from banks and other sources so we don't<br>have a natural protection to that<br>opportunity but we are a natural player<br>in us and our view is that given that we<br>can play a role in deposits and loans<br>home loans and credit cards and<br>superannuation and investments and<br>insurance life insurance general<br>insurance all those things we are able<br>to show customers that beholders greater<br>than some of the parts and if we succeed<br>in doing that they get benefits out of<br>relationship we get more loyal customers<br>when we have our strategy discussions<br>one of the underpinning beliefs which<br>will never be shaken is no matter how<br>good we get at innovating and improving<br>the customer experience aspects of what<br>we do have commodity characteristics and<br>price matters and there are people with<br>inherently lower cost models competing<br>for our customers business and they are<br>inevitably going to do it at lower price<br>points it is an absolute existential<br>imperative for the bank to evolve to a<br>lower cost structure and that's why when<br>we're talking about technology we always<br>start with what it can do for the<br>customer but equally when we're talking<br>internally we look at the ability of<br>analytics of artificial intelligence of<br>robotics<br>etc to fundamentally transform the cost<br>base now that does not mean we don't<br>need people we do need people but it<br>does mean that as the bank continues to<br>grow we ought to be able to do it in a<br>way we were able to get much better<br>economies of scale for our investments<br>and if we can't do this we can be<br>beautiful and customers love dealing<br>with us to the end of the day they'll go<br>with a mortgage is cheaper or where you<br>get a bit of posit right and if we're<br>going to compete with that aspect of<br>what they want which we need - we must<br>be doing it from much much more</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
