Professor Lowe holds the Fletcher Building Education Trust Chair in Leadership.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the notion of responsible followership<br>is actually quite a new idea and its<br>really derived out of the responsible<br>leadership literature which is pretty<br>new in and of itself the responsible<br>leadership literature is really the<br>first leadership theory to focus on the<br>multiple stakeholders of the firm most<br>leadership theories are focused on just<br>managing your group or your team or<br>maybe even one-on-one interaction and<br>responsible leadership is looking at how<br>do I consider a multi-stakeholder view<br>communities government the environment<br>all sorts of constituents and so<br>extending that notion of responsible<br>leadership is what does responsible<br>followership look like how might the<br>follower conceive what they need to do<br>is a follower and what might delete or<br>expect the follower to bring to the<br>workplace in an organization where we as<br>a collective or taking a truly<br>multi-stakeholder multi constituent view<br>responsible follower is going to have to<br>bring more of themselves to work we hear<br>a lot about more rapid change<br>organizations report that they're<br>engaging in more rapid change and ever<br>if you look at the statistics more<br>change initiatives on average you're<br>being brought to the workplace every<br>year and the burden on thinking that the<br>leader can direct and be have all the<br>mana have all the knowledge has is<br>increasingly a false dichotomy and so<br>when we look at employee engagement<br>about fifteen percent of employees<br>report being highly engaged about<br>fifteen percent report being actively<br>disengaged and that great middle about<br>65 or 70 percent haven't made their<br>minds up yet whether they're going to be<br>engaged or not so responsible<br>followership is an opportunity to ask<br>people to bring more of them their whole<br>selves to work and so when we get down<br>to what are the qualities that one needs<br>to may be a responsible follower it's<br>things like having an active moral<br>compass saying that I have an ethical<br>perspective on these particular issues I<br>know things because I'm now going to be<br>outward looking so one of the things<br>we'd ask foreign responsible<br>followership is thinking about multiple<br>stakeholders bringing that perspective<br>to the leader whether you consider<br>challenging or coaching or consulting<br>with the leader so I think when we think<br>about what an organizational system<br>would look like that developed<br>responsible followers one of the things<br>we have to look at is do we spend any<br>money or time asking people to develop<br>the followership role if you google<br>leadership development right now you'll<br>find that for example in the US alone<br>there's 20 billion dollars a year spent<br>on leader development if you google<br>follower development do you know what<br>you'll find you'll find nothing part of<br>what we have to think about when we<br>think about developing responsible<br>followers is what is the spend on<br>followership and then drilling down to<br>those qualities of what responsible<br>follower looks like encouraging them to<br>bring more of themselves to the<br>workplace their own moral compass<br>encouraging them to have foresight to be<br>thinking towards the future something<br>that we've typically delegated to the<br>leader as the knowing individual well<br>when we think about the leadership<br>system as the leader the follower in a<br>context and we're co constructing change<br>we're dealing with what heifetz would<br>call really wicked problems adaptive<br>challenges that there's no easy solution<br>for then a responsible organization is<br>going to say we've got to develop<br>responsible leaders and responsible<br>followers and equal parts and then<br>challenge leaders to let the followers<br>do what responsible followership looks<br>like and encourage the followers to do<br>those things that look like responsible<br>fall over show when we think about<br>whether responsible followership puts<br>more burden on the employees we've<br>really got to think about what do they<br>consider a burden so it could well be<br>that it's a tremendous burden to show up<br>to work and be told what to do and not<br>feel like you have much autonomy there's<br>a guy named Studs Terkel who writes ice<br>and author philosopher ii wears many<br>hats<br>that work is the search for meaning<br>while in search of your daily bread and<br>when you think about what we're asking<br>from employees with respect to<br>responsible followership we're asking<br>them to bring more of themselves to work<br>to have more opinions to share more<br>openly to share more freely and so if<br>you think about what most people do in<br>terms of getting meaning it's from being<br>impactful it's from getting better the<br>golfer wants to get their score down the<br>tennis player wants to get more balls in<br>play an employee comes to work in search<br>of meaning not just in search of their<br>daily bread and so when we talk about<br>what responsible followership looks like<br>we are challenging employees to rican<br>sieve the follower role but that's why<br>we have to do that in tandem with<br>leadership development we have to coach<br>leaders to solicit these sorts of<br>behaviors from followers so that they<br>create create a safe place to be a<br>responsible follower but what you should<br>get collectively is a responsible<br>organization that is more agile is more<br>adaptive challenge it takes on<br>challenges more rapidly is more willing<br>to admit I got it wrong let's do<br>something different in short to be the<br>sort of agile firm we need in the 21st<br>century I think the practical steps an<br>organization can take to encourage<br>responsible followership is to sit down<br>and develop as we do with most things a<br>set of values around responsible<br>followership organizational systems that<br>would encourage responsible for worship<br>reward systems that would encourage<br>responsible followership I mean can you<br>imagine a performance appraisal form<br>that says how many times did you<br>challenge your leader in a constructive<br>way this quarter or this month or<br>whatever the performance appraisal<br>window might be and that both the leader<br>and the follower would recognize and<br>agree that constructive challenges or a<br>positive thing we tend to not sort of<br>reward the types of behaviors again we<br>largely have organizational systems that<br>are still built on the industrial model<br>coming out of the 60s where you could<br>wrote Lee tell employees who weren't<br>especially educated what<br>do we have evolved some I don't mean to<br>say we're stuck in the 60s but if you<br>look at what we reward and how we<br>measure performance when it comes to the<br>notion of the follower role it's still<br>largely focused on compliance rather<br>than constructive challenge and teamwork<br>so I think if we think about it from a<br>systemic standpoint we'll say how do we<br>refocus the HR spend on at the same time<br>developing notions of responsible<br>followers and followers and responsible<br>followers in leaders and if we can get<br>to some sort of collective set of values<br>if we could reward and reinforce those<br>types of behaviors then we're much more</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
