Bank of Australia CEO Ian Narev discusses the logic of buying start-ups, the future of branches, and the new digital frontier.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we serve a critical need and as people<br>are dealing with money they are wanting<br>to be able to do that in a way which is<br>convenient to them easily understandable<br>feels like it's on par with how they're<br>shopping for their retailing on<br>companies like Amazon or how they're<br>searching on Google or other you know<br>technology companies the expectations<br>are going up so for us this really has<br>become a critical part of what we need<br>to do well to continue to be successful<br>the first thing that we need to do is<br>understand that the world is changing<br>there barriers to entry are going down<br>competitions going up and whereas over<br>decades banking might have seemed to be<br>a little bit of a closed shop that has<br>changed and is going to continue to<br>change radically whether it's the<br>startups the fintechs or other<br>established banks innovating quickly or<br>other technology driven players who have<br>decided to come into financial services<br>so you know we benchmark ourselves<br>against our traditional competitors<br>they're generally very good we have to<br>work hard to compete well against them<br>but these days it's just the start of<br>the challenge even if you feel you're<br>doing a reasonable job against the<br>traditional competitors looking days<br>weeks months ahead there are a whole lot<br>of other choices for customers but at<br>the end of the day it's good for<br>customers and you've got to believe that<br>what's good for customers is going to be<br>good for the industry if they can<br>there's no doubt that changes in culture<br>and ways of doing business are critical<br>if we're going to survive so on the one<br>hand the basic values of banking<br>integrity being here for the customers<br>etc that were the same a hundred years<br>ago are still as applicable as ever that<br>doesn't change Trust is at the core of<br>what we do and needs to be but the way<br>in which we interact with our customers<br>the way in which we provide our products<br>and services the way in which we talk to<br>them is evolving and old established<br>business processes will only go so far<br>as to achieve that now that isn't the<br>same as saying that people who did<br>things the old way can adapt we've got<br>people the Commonwealth banks who have<br>been with us for more than 50 years I<br>called somebody last week who's 50 years<br>with a company she is loving life she's<br>in risk management we've got new<br>analytic tools for risk and she's loving<br>adapting to them and loving life more<br>probably than any time previously in the<br>bank so it's not the same as saying<br>people can't adapt I think a lot of<br>people can adapt do adept successfully<br>want to adapt but we do need to realize<br>that old slow cumbersome ways of doing<br>businesses will no longer get us to<br>where we need to get to at the same time<br>as understanding we need to balance risk<br>we're heavily regulated we've got high<br>compliance burdens and those things have<br>got to coexist with the agility<br>everybody talks about about digital<br>businesses so yeah that's a that's a<br>at some level there is a logic for banks<br>buying startups I mean the Commonwealth<br>banks perspective a couple of years ago<br>we bought a small FinTech business in<br>South Africa called take your money<br>everywhere the reason we bought us was<br>because we've got businesses and<br>emerging markets and we weren't able to<br>crack a particular way in which digital<br>account opening could deal with the new<br>regulation particularly to know your<br>customer requirements of anti money<br>laundering legislation this group in<br>South Africa had cracked us we found<br>them build a great relationship with<br>them ended up buying them a couple of<br>years later their founders are still<br>leading the business the rate of<br>innovation has gone up and actually the<br>combination of the resources and the<br>know-how of the Commonwealth Bank and<br>the agility and entrepreneurial nature<br>of the start I've ever worked very very<br>well now in other occasions are going to<br>be competitors and in other occasions<br>you've got to realise that sometimes<br>when a big company buys a small company<br>the fit just doesn't work because often<br>the bureaucracy can quash the innovation<br>so there isn't a correct answer but I<br>think there's certainly a fertile ground<br>for banks working together with startups<br>in some cases investing in them and in<br>other cases just realizing we need to<br>compete hard against them all those<br>options are part of our competitive<br>well we are probably become wealth being<br>a little bit of an outlier on the topic<br>of branches because while we believe<br>that the digital interface with<br>customers needs to be exceptionally good<br>we believe that for the medium term at<br>least and beyond that I can't predict<br>branches are going to continue to play a<br>critical role they change so our<br>branches are now on shorter lease lifes<br>we tend to have them over four or five<br>years we don't own them so they're much<br>more adaptable when the lease comes up<br>we will often change the format put new<br>technology in there like deposit<br>machines retrain our people so they're<br>able to engage differently with<br>customers no longer behind big screens<br>etc but the physical interface with a<br>customer in our mind at least today is<br>still a critical way of interacting with<br>customers and you can see that I mean<br>even you've got Amazon opening stores<br>you've got Apple opening stores now<br>they're not opening thousands of them<br>but even the big digital companies who<br>have made their name on digital<br>interfaces have seen the opportunity for<br>the physical interface and we continue<br>to see that that's important now what we<br>do need to make sure is that if that<br>changes rapidly we're in a position to<br>change rapidly with it and that's why we<br>want the branch network to be more<br>flexible but we are big believers that<br>the physical interface needs to sit<br>alongside the digital doesn't get<br>I think there are a couple of angles of<br>that the real next frontier of digital<br>number one is increasingly putting the<br>power into the hands of the customer now<br>these are cliches and all these sorts of<br>businesses on demand wherever you want<br>it cetera but this is right you need to<br>be able to present the bank 24 by 7<br>mobile fixed in any way the customer<br>wants to interact and let her or him<br>guide their own experience increasing<br>and that's happening more and more and<br>again the benchmarks for that are<br>generally outside financial services so<br>that's sort of Part A which is the<br>digital interface underneath that<br>there's the increasing power of<br>analytics of smart computing of<br>computing power of machine learning and<br>that's enabling our data to enrich the<br>individual customers experience and<br>we're seeing this very powerfully today<br>with small business so through our<br>market shares and credit cards and<br>point-of-sale machines we are now able<br>to give our small business customers the<br>same insight into their customer base as<br>big businesses used to be the only ones<br>who could get it because they with any<br>ones who could spend the money so I can<br>go to a florist and Darlinghurst and in<br>a Sydney and tell her more here on<br>average where their customers live what<br>they spend in various categories while<br>completely preserving the privacy of the<br>customers just because the volume of the<br>data so that whole issue is sort of<br>number two and number three undoubtedly<br>with artificial intelligence and<br>robotics the digital capability is<br>transforming the what used to be called<br>the back office of the bank so all those<br>three things are coexisting and they're<br>all continuing the innovations<br>continuing at a rate of naught so that<br>there is no offseason there's no time to<br>take a breath and the rate of change is</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
