The Emerging Tech Stars from the University of Auckland showcased how they are either inventing or using technology in an innovative way.<br><br>Presentations included:<br><br>Blood Spatter research<br>Ravishka Arthur, PhD candidate, Faculty of Science<br><br>Bloodstains are a common by-product of violent crime and the analysis of these stains forms a vital part of a crime scene investigation. However, no one method around bloodstain pattern classification claims to be fully validated and widely accepted resulting in qualitative and at times controversial data. Ravishka is working on how pattern recognition and eye tracking technology can be combined to build a novel bloodstain pattern classification system.<br><br>The small aspirations of a tiny turkey baster<br>Ankita Gangotra, PhD candidate and nanotechnologist, Faculty of Science<br><br>Research in science and technology is becoming increasingly multidisciplinary. The borders between science, engineering and technology are slowly fading. Ankita’s research uses tiny turkey basters to suck up some of the smallest parts of our bodies, to test how squishy or stiff they are. This could be a very early indicator of disease such as cancer. Come along to hear more about Ankita’s adventures in bridging the gap between physics, chemistry and biology.<br><br>Sorting sperm cells with lasers<br>Peter Hosking, PhD candidate and Project Manager for Engender Technologies<br><br>Engender Technologies, a spin-off company from the University of Auckland’s Photon Factory, is developing a photonic and microfluidic-based solution to sort sperm cells by sex. There currently is a gap in the market for an affordable and effective solution to this problem. Engender exploits minute differences in DNA content between male and female cells to determine sex via fluorescence. Advanced laser technology is used to manipulate and separate sperm cells on a compact and disposable microfluidic chip.<br><br>Living light<br>Hannah Read, research assistant, Bioluminescent Superbugs Lab<br><br>Bioluminescence, or “living light”, is the remarkable ability of organisms to glow. It’s the light produced by living creatures, like glowworms, fireflies and even some bacteria. Hannah and her colleagues have been using a safe and naturally glowing bacterium to illuminate people’s understanding of microbes. Using this technology, and their own microbiology expertise, they have developed an educational microbiology kit, allowing people to paint with bacteria and see their living, glowing artwork.<br><br>Digital sun protection<br>Daniel Xu, Co-founder of Spark 64<br><br>UV is an invisible radiation from the sun that causes thousands of deaths from skin cancer each year. UVLens aims to educate individuals by providing digital information and tools to teach people about UV and sun safety. UVLens combines a network of sensor stations with forecast algorithms to deliver live UV warnings on a smartphone app and help people balance their sun exposure. Daniel, Co-Founder and CEO of UVLens will describe how UV Lens is developing products to help people live healthier outdoor lives.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

of a big<br>fat microphone<br>my name is Wendy Kerr and it's my<br>absolute delight to welcome you all here<br>tonight for our merging techstars talk<br>at the University of Auckland I have the<br>pleasure to be the director for the<br>Center for innovation and<br>entrepreneurship and our mission is to<br>unleash the spirit of innovation and<br>entrepreneurship across everyone at the<br>University and we do this through<br>hosting a range of experience shall<br>workshops programs and events just like<br>this so that we can broaden people's<br>views about what being innovative is how<br>to be entrepreneurial and what impact<br>that will make with the New Zealand<br>economy so we are delighted that you<br>could spend some time with us tonight<br>and I'd like to thank Naomi and shrestha<br>who are part of my team who have pulled<br>this together so we are getting involved<br>in Tech Week and for those of you who<br>don't know Tech Week is a week designed<br>by New Zealand Tech and it's a<br>nationwide event and it's designed to<br>celebrate innovation and technology<br>across all of New Zealand and the reason<br>why we love to get involved in tech week<br>is because we're passionate about<br>enabling students and staff to transform<br>their thinking and build their<br>entrepreneurial capability so that we<br>can build New Zealand into a prosperous<br>and creative nation so we aim to<br>entertain educate and inspire you<br>tonight we have a fantastic lineup of<br>six emerging textiles from our lives and<br>the University of Auckland and they are<br>a range of emerging academics PhD<br>students and researchers they're going<br>to spend a bit of time talking about<br>what they're passionate about and how<br>they make it happen and what they hope<br>to do with it and then once they've all<br>spoken we're going to have a panel<br>discussion at the end which I will<br>facilitate so I'd love you to hold all<br>of your questions of<br>I know you'll have plenty right to the<br>end and then we can get everyone's views<br>on what your questions may be so about<br>further ado let's introduce our first<br>speaker and this woman is passionate<br>about blood splatter so there's an<br>opening line metal party Sourav ishka I<br>saw she is a PhD candidate at the<br>Faculty of science and she is working on<br>understanding more about blood splatter<br>at crime scenes and of course there's a<br>lot of information within blood and of<br>course how it's planted out in a crime<br>scene and I know many of you will be<br>casting your mind directly to CSI and<br>she tells me that it's a lot more<br>sophisticated than anything you've seen<br>on TV so I'm delighted to introduce<br>thanks Wendy at oh wait hundred hours on<br>the 24th of March 2015<br>forensic scientists were called to the<br>scene of a violent crime what appears to<br>be in normal house in the middle of<br>suburbia is now the scene of a violent<br>crime<br>Plus Bette has been found at the outside<br>of a house and on the inside a male John<br>Doe in his early 20s has been pronounced<br>dead severe blood staining has been<br>found on the wall behind him and a<br>potential weapon in his arms the<br>circumstances are suspicious ladies and<br>gentlemen welcome to my world of<br>forensics and blood spatter thank you<br>for being here and taking the time out<br>of your day to listen to me and tell you<br>all about what I'm passionate about and<br>without further ado why am i passionate<br>about forensics<br>well you probably all know about these<br>cool forensic TV shows like Dexter or<br>CSI and I just want you to imagine<br>yourself as an investigator on one of<br>these crime shows whether you're just<br>like Dexter who likes analyzing blood<br>spatter or you're an investigator on CSI<br>who loves to piece together the puzzle<br>of and that makes up a crime well that's<br>exactly what I used to do<br>I love these TV shows and this was what<br>inspired me to get into forensics now<br>you're all probably thinking well I<br>could have just then become an actress<br>and gone to Hollywood and acted in CSI<br>but actually I was really passionate<br>about the science because I knew that<br>there was so much unknown information<br>about forensic science I was also<br>inspired by cases like the Amanda Knox<br>case and the Oscar Pistorius case which<br>tended to shed some negative light on<br>forensics I wanted that inspired me<br>because I wanted to go into the backdrop<br>of what forensics was about and really<br>understand the science so blood stain<br>patent analysis is the study of the<br>shapes the sizes the directionality of<br>blood stains found at crime scenes and<br>one of the jobs that blood stain pattern<br>expert does is to distinguish between<br>different types of blood stain patterns<br>so as an example we can see up on the<br>screen here two different types of blood<br>stain patterns that were found at crime<br>scenes on the top here we have arterial<br>spatter which is the result of a<br>breached artery and on the bottom an<br>analyst would classify this pattern as<br>an impact spatter so a force that's<br>acted on a blood source so as I said the<br>job of the expert is to be able to<br>distinguish this and at the moment the<br>challenge is that scientists re analysts<br>aren't being very scientific by how<br>they're doing this they're depending on<br>their experience and their knowledge to<br>guide them in this and there's no real<br>objective means of analyzing patterns so<br>this inspired me because I wanted to<br>understand the science and develop a way<br>of actually helping analysts be more<br>objective Sakhi in keeping with the<br>theme of tonight at technology has<br>really got grown grown and in forensics<br>at the moment what we use is high speed<br>video technology what you can see on the<br>screen in front of you is a person<br>coughing up blood and high-speed video<br>technology is now used very actively by<br>forensic scientists to give us<br>information about how these blood stain<br>patterns form in my own research I was<br>really inspired by understanding what<br>analysts actually do when they look at<br>blood stain pattern<br>and this was my idea to go along and use<br>some eye tracking technology to capture<br>analysts in terms of what they were<br>looking at so what you see on the right<br>hand side is a recording of an analyst<br>as he is looking at a pattern that I<br>created in the lab and I use this<br>technology to just help me get into the<br>mindset of the analyst now as I said<br>technology is evolving and we want to<br>help scientists be more objective at the<br>crime scene so part of my task was to<br>develop an image processing based<br>methodology that could help analyst<br>extract information from a blood stain<br>pattern I also wanted to use pattern<br>recognition algorithms to develop a<br>automated system that could help<br>analysts actually do some of this work<br>at the crime scene to help them analyze<br>the pattern and classify these patterns<br>into different types so part of this<br>process was to use image processing<br>methods so taking a pattern removing the<br>background doing some measurements and<br>extracting some features like the impact<br>angle or the area and other important<br>information and i found that my my<br>computerized method could actually do<br>the job of the analyst it could take a<br>patent and it could classify pattern<br>unknown patterns based on examples so I<br>found that this is interesting because<br>it sparked in me potentially something<br>that could be commercially viable so as<br>you will know we have existing 3d<br>technology that's in the market and I've<br>really thought about incorporating my<br>pattern recognition method with existing<br>technology so as an example we've got a<br>share of a crime scene reconstruction<br>and I want to use my technology by<br>marrying it up with existing technology<br>so analysts can go to the crime scene<br>they're their eye movements can be<br>tracked and they can get immediate<br>feedback about a pattern whether it be<br>the sizes of stains the irregularity in<br>stains and I think that this could be<br>potentially a powerful tool that can<br>stand its ground in court so as you can<br>expect there have been a lot of<br>challenges going through this process of<br>really analyzing patterns and coming up<br>with ways of being objective technology<br>for me has been a positive challenge one<br>thing I had to learn was programming and<br>I found that actually that was a very<br>useful tool to learn because I was able<br>to develop all these methods using a<br>programming language<br>I found that there was resistance to<br>change I found that people in the<br>forensic science field were unwilling to<br>accept that a machine can do their job<br>but what I was trying to show was that<br>technology is there to assist us and<br>we've got to capitalize on that<br>motivation that can be a huge you know<br>barrier to us as we do out in our<br>research careers and I found that being<br>a research and myself I often had to<br>take ten steps backwards and look at my<br>work from the outside perspective just<br>to gain that motivation back and finally<br>accepting that you don't always know<br>what the right answer is I found that as<br>a researcher people think that I know<br>that how my program works or how things<br>should be but I think one thing that<br>I've accepted is that I don't always<br>know the right answer and that's okay so<br>my name is Rebecca asses thank you for<br>listening and no humans were harmed in<br>the making of this presentation thank<br>you very much for visca that was<br>absolutely fascinating and what I was<br>really pleased to hear you is the edge<br>or challenges and often when we're on<br>this pathway of innovation there are<br>many challenges and sometimes we don't<br>hear about them but I think that also<br>helps us understand that we can overcome<br>the challenges to create something truly<br>innovative thank you so next up we've<br>got someone who has patients without<br>sperm and not just any spoon but sperm<br>from Bulls and this is a multi-billion<br>dollar global industry that he's about<br>to get interested in so this is Peter<br>hoskin he is a PhD candidate and a<br>project manager for engendered<br>technologies and engendered technologies<br>is a very successful spinoff from the<br>photon Factory which is one of our labs<br>and the science secretary at the<br>University<br>thank you this is probably not a dream I<br>had for myself when I was eight years<br>old but I am proudly passionate a spoon<br>now so the the dairy industry is huge in<br>New Zealand we have about five million<br>cows right now and last year we produce<br>21 billion litres of milk one of the<br>best opportunities for market disruption<br>in the dairy industry right now is in<br>the sex selection and that's because<br>every year dairy farmers artificially<br>inseminate their herd of cows and if<br>Nature has left to its own devices<br>you're going to give 50 percent male<br>offspring and 50 percent females now the<br>females they're mostly used to replace<br>the dairy cows but the males don't have<br>the same career opportunities the most<br>that the males can ever hope to become<br>as a hamburger but but the sad thing is<br>they're not even going to become the<br>best or the tastiest hamburger because<br>these males have been selectively bred<br>using genetics that are best for dairy<br>not beef and so you know as beef cattle<br>they're not very high value but if dairy<br>farmers were able to just flick a switch<br>and have that determine whether or not a<br>cow would give birth to a male or a<br>female then they'd be able to ensure<br>that only high-value females were ever<br>born ok and this is where gender can<br>offer a solution so in gender as Wendy<br>said as a spin-off company that I am<br>currently working for and we are<br>developing a microfluidic and photonics<br>based technology for sorting male &amp;<br>female bull sperm by sex<br>there is one sole competitor to this<br>technology they've enjoyed a monopoly<br>for the last few decades but<br>unfortunately for them their technology<br>is lousy<br>it's it's very slow it's very expensive<br>and most importantly it damages the<br>sperms<br>and so that lowers fertility rates and<br>as a result of all of those things the<br>uptake in the market has not been very<br>strong at all<br>however in gender has been able to<br>design around the limitations of the<br>competing technology and our chip based<br>design is low cost it's sufficient and<br>three gentle on the sperm so this is<br>basically how it works very simplified<br>schematic obviously but it does show the<br>four key steps that we've identified as<br>being sort of critical to make this<br>process work<br>everything you see here happens on a<br>microfluidic disposable chip that fits<br>in the palm of your hands the channels<br>that direct the flow of the sperm cells<br>are about the size of a human strand of<br>here<br>so anyway step one is flow focusing the<br>cells inker from the left and they reach<br>a junction where multiple sort of sheet<br>flow inputs converge on the cells and<br>they separate them out and then sandwich<br>them to the center of the channel so<br>that they're sort of lined up one by one<br>so to eat the tail in a nice thin stream<br>the second step is orientation here bull<br>sperm they're actually disc-shaped<br>they're they're kind of like little<br>frisbees with a tail and we need all of<br>those frisbees to be lined up one in<br>front of the other as well as being<br>double as well as having the same<br>orientation in each time so that the<br>flow focusing puts in one in front of<br>the other orientation they all have to<br>have the same orientation and that's<br>critical for the next step which is<br>detection and this is the part that's<br>like obviously necessary at some point<br>we have to know whether it's a male or a<br>female and the only way that anybody<br>knows whether a cell is male or female<br>is by looking at the DNA this is for<br>bovine sperm and so the male bovines for<br>himself is characterized by a Y<br>chromosome the female is characterized<br>by an X<br>the X chromosome is just ever so<br>slightly bigger than the Y chromosome<br>and so what we do is we stain the DNA<br>inside the sperm cell with a fluorescent<br>dye and then we take a UV light source<br>we illuminate the cells one at a time<br>and because the female cell has the<br>slightly larger X chromosome it glows<br>with a little bit more intensity than<br>the male cell and at this point we can<br>do switching so now we know whether it's<br>a male or a female cell we've got to do<br>something with it all we have to do<br>actually is just move the cells sort of<br>up or down up if it's a female so that<br>goes out the top channel down if it's a<br>male so it goes at the bottom Channel<br>and this is where sort of engenders core<br>IP comes in and actually I'm being a<br>mess I've forgot to point out that our<br>core IP is also important in the<br>orientation step so I mentioned we have<br>to orient them and the way that we do<br>that is to get is to use laser beams to<br>apply a force to the cell so that that<br>in that force just flips every cell one<br>by one and to a particular orientation<br>and it's that same physics that we're<br>using the switching step so we put a<br>laser into the chip and we use the force<br>that that laser and parts on the cell to<br>just nudge it just by a few diameters up<br>or down and that gives us enough control<br>to ensure it goes out one of the<br>selected output channels or collection<br>so I have a couple of videos I can show<br>you this one is a demonstration of the<br>hydrodynamic flow focusing in step one<br>so instead of sperm cells we've put red<br>food coloring into the sample and put<br>and this lets you visualize what happens<br>to the flow in the main channel and so<br>you can see the effect of the vertical<br>sheath flow channels sandwiches that red<br>dye into a thin stream and we have quite<br>good control over a thickness and<br>position in this next video<br>unfortunately what you're seeing is not<br>sperm cells I couldn't show any sperm<br>cells or the board will have my guts but<br>I can show you an old experiment that we<br>early on where we sort of simulated the<br>effect of putting small particles into a<br>light beam and so what you're seeing<br>here is a map plaguing the the ten<br>micron particle so there we go<br>coming in from the list and there is a<br>laser which is invisible but it's coming<br>down from the top center of the screen<br>and it's deflecting those microspheres<br>one by one and that's how we do the<br>switching so in June the heads enjoyed<br>already a fair amount of success we've<br>raised over four-and-a-half million<br>dollars in funding we've partnered with<br>two of the world's largest artificial<br>insemination companies we've also just<br>recently signed a deal with the biggest<br>theory company in China in addition to<br>that we were the winner for the egg tech<br>category in Silicon Valley World Cup<br>Tech Challenge we were named one of the<br>five most innovative international<br>startups by AG funder and also named one<br>of the most promising early-stage<br>companies worth 10 100 finally any<br>success that we have had or will have is<br>very much the result of a team effort<br>these are our fearless leaders Brynn<br>Ogilvy jammu Gus Mervis and Gary Payson<br>together they handle the business side<br>of things<br>Keith's a facilitator Simpson is the<br>founding scientist and leader of the<br>technology and last but not least these<br>are the technology team these are the<br>people I see every day they're a joy to<br>work with and they are a mix of<br>physicists biologists engineers without<br>their diverse range of talents none of<br>thank you so much Peter that was<br>absolutely fascinating I think you'll<br>all agree and what was mind-blowing to<br>me and I think we're going to hear more<br>of this in a minute is how much one can<br>do on such a tiny scale and I think what<br>you're going to do is going to transform<br>the dairy industry we hope thank you so<br>much now I have been reverse of not<br>telling you what our social media<br>strategy is for tonight so we're on<br>Facebook and the Facebook tag is<br>uoa CIE so that's at you are you Oh a<br>CIE<br>so if you want to post anything follow<br>anyone that's the place to do it<br>so our next speaker is passionate about<br>tiny tiny things so Ankita green grotta<br>is a PhD candidate and a<br>nanotechnologist at the Faculty of<br>science and she's really embraced how<br>multidisciplinary research can be so she<br>reaches over physics biology and<br>chemistry to create the work that she<br>does she's also really pioneering the<br>use of bases and she's put it here a<br>tiny turkey baster to understand what<br>happens inside our bodies and this will<br>help us lead to the early detection of<br>cancer and other disease so thank you<br>thank you ok I'm going to try and use<br>the mic and this and also demonstrate<br>all of the stuff I have here to yourself<br>literally be juggling but alright so I<br>am a PhD student at the Department of<br>Physics but I'm actually an electronics<br>engineer by training currently my labs<br>in chemistry but I'm working on<br>biological samples so when someone asks<br>me what I do it can be quite a tricky<br>answer but the common denominator here<br>is nanotechnology I usually say I'm a<br>nanotechnologist and that I study the<br>signs of very small things so my<br>research is in the adaptation of nanoka<br>petting a parrot is for nano aspiration<br>and we love as scientists using really<br>fancy terms but for the fear of losing<br>ginger boredom I'm going to avoid using<br>jargon so what I'm trying to do<br>basically is make a tool make a<br>technology using very very very small<br>objects called pipette which look<br>exactly<br>like this turkey baster here only a<br>million times smaller and I'm doing this<br>to aspirate or suck up very tiny<br>particles now I'll get right down to the<br>point when does these effects our body<br>it changes the mechanical properties of<br>some of the cells in our bodies so<br>disease such as cancer sickle cell<br>disease and malaria can make ourselves<br>stiffer or it can make it softer but<br>there are parts of our body<br>smaller themselves known as exosomes<br>these are about a hundred sorry these<br>are about ten to a hundred times smaller<br>themselves and they're basically packets<br>of proteins that are exchanged between<br>cells now we don't know much about their<br>physical or mechanical properties let<br>alone how they're affected by a disease<br>so through my project we're trying to<br>learn what these properties of these<br>exosomes are and eventually we hope to<br>be able to characterize and catalog them<br>on the basis of this and this is where<br>my little turkey bassists come in handy<br>what I'm trying to do the idea is to<br>first try and locate these X's ohm's on<br>a surface and once they're located high<br>pressure to try and set them up if they<br>don't get sucked up this dip but if they<br>do the squishy so it's as simple as that<br>and now that you understand most of the<br>basic concepts of my project I'm going<br>to show you exactly what a week looks<br>like doing research for me right so<br>Mondays I'm usually really excited about<br>going into work and doing science there<br>go in and I have a meeting with my<br>supervisor I talk to him about what I<br>did in the previous week and what I<br>should be doing in the next week often i<br>fabricate my little nano pipette so I'm<br>gonna try and show it to you I don't<br>know if you can see it often even I<br>can't see it but there you go<br>and I fabricated these out of quartz<br>glass in a machine that fires a laser at<br>the glass a heat could have beyond its<br>melting point and pulls it apart making<br>these little two pillories and it takes<br>about five minutes to make ten or<br>fifteen of these so I get to do that but<br>I also get to do some really cool things<br>like design and 3d print objects for my<br>lab and my supervisor will be happy to<br>know I also do a lot of reading reading<br>is a very very crucial part of research<br>as one always has to keep abreast with<br>the latest findings in their field so<br>Tuesday's I usually spend over this<br>table in my lab hunched over this table<br>in my lab wearing these gloves and wear<br>it for you but it's going to be fiddly<br>with the mic so I want also they make my<br>hands really my palms really sweaty and<br>stinky so I wonder that right now but<br>yeah so what I usually spend such a day<br>doing is I spend it trying to set up my<br>experiment I take these little pipette<br>and I try and align it I get caught up<br>in wires and I stumble and I drop it<br>when I pick it up and I see it's broken<br>and I restart and I get to use cool<br>devices like a pretentious that and<br>appears or translator but sometimes I<br>also resort to using basic tools like a<br>hammer<br>so I go home feeling exhausted and tired<br>but I persevere I come back the next day<br>and I write code and I program and I try<br>and collect data and if I'm able to<br>collect data I try and analyze it and I<br>hope things are working and as things<br>indeed are working the next very crucial<br>step is writing up your results so I<br>write and I draw graphs and charts and I<br>analyze and make sure that my results<br>are repeatable and are consistent<br>and at the end of the day when I'm done<br>writing up and I'm ready to send it over<br>to my supervisor<br>I feel pretty pleased with myself so the<br>next thing I'm gonna report comes back<br>with more red marks than white paper on<br>the page a lot of emotions go through my<br>head but mostly I feel sorry for my<br>supervisor who has to read my terrible<br>writing I have to write at least four or<br>five more times to get it perfectly<br>right to publish the paper so that's<br>what a week looks like for a researcher<br>like me in the lab and while I mean<br>there are lots of ups and downs but<br>don't quote me on this number but but<br>seventh sorry 95% of the times research<br>in science doesn't work the way you<br>wanted to but the 5% of the times that<br>it actually does it's totally worth it<br>thank you thank you very much it was<br>absolutely fascinating to get inside the<br>day and the life of a PhD researcher<br>which I have just learned so much in<br>that last five minutes<br>so our large speaker is coming up and<br>she is passionate about glowing bacteria<br>and how many of you have ever seen a<br>glow worm okay so what we're going to<br>hear about is that bioluminescence that<br>emits from these organisms and how a<br>business has been created around using<br>glowing bacteria to help people learn<br>about science in a fun way<br>so we've got Hannah Reed who is a<br>research assistant and the<br>bioluminescence superbugs LED to talk to<br>us<br>hello hold that a little bit further<br>away hopefully everyone can hear me<br>that's great<br>brilliant so as I don't actually have a<br>nametag so hopefully remember the next<br>few words I say which is my name is<br>Hannah and I am a postdoctoral<br>researcher at the Medical School so I'm<br>a microbiologist by training so I work<br>on nasty pathogens so those are national<br>bugs which make people sick so I'm going<br>to show you some pictures and not quite<br>as glorious bud Sparrow arms but there<br>are some mice over a little bit know<br>whatever um so what you can see here on<br>the screen on your left you've got some<br>mice which are infected with bacteria<br>which causes food poisoning but you know<br>because that's what we do in our lab<br>we've made the bacteria glow in the dark<br>so those bright spots that you can see<br>there are actually the bacteria that you<br>can see from us in the living animal<br>what you can see on the right there<br>because another thing that we do is<br>we're looking to see if we can find new<br>antibiotics so the bacteria only glow<br>when they're alive so the ones which<br>aren't growing on that so the ones you<br>can actually see they're ones which have<br>been killed by whatever antibiotic is<br>being produced on that plate so that's<br>my day job I use things which glow in<br>the dark which is pretty cool but<br>unfortunately none of these things can<br>actually come out of the lab which is a<br>real shame because you know stuff that<br>glows is really cool right we all like<br>stuff that glows shiny things<br>so to help us explain these sorts of<br>things to people you know in the public<br>in a way which won't actually make them<br>sick because that's really really bad<br>bad publicity we don't want that happen<br>we went and found a naturally glowing<br>bacteria from the ocean perfectly safe<br>and then we can actually show that to<br>people and do all sorts of cool things<br>with them first I'll give you a little<br>bit of science behind it so you can you<br>can learn something while you're here<br>because that's good so the bacteria<br>produce an enzyme called a luciferase<br>and this luciferase needs a few things<br>so that it can glow so it needs a<br>Lucifer<br>which is a substrate it needs oxygen it<br>needs energy and then it will glow and<br>also looks really cool so it looks<br>something like this but pictures aren't<br>actually that exciting are they how<br>about we actually look at what they look<br>like right here can we turn the lights<br>off please more lights please<br>yeah still on yes what we've got here is<br>some glowing back here it doesn't look<br>like it's glowing very much of it<br>that's because it needs oxygen but if we<br>give it a bit of a shake suddenly starts<br>glowing again not on there mmm<br>goes pretty cool we've also got it on<br>someplace here nice shiny got one and in<br>a case you're wondering what it is it's<br>and I'm not really much of an artist but<br>I had to do another one because we have<br>okay we can have the lights icon again<br>and stop bugging the camera crew okay<br>great so that's what it looks like it's<br>pretty cool it's pretty good at we can<br>we can take this out to the public<br>people can look at it they can get<br>excited about it you know you can have<br>kids actually touching it playing with<br>it so we've done some pretty cool things<br>with it including getting involved in<br>wearable science competitions so this is<br>myself when I had much shorter hair and<br>a couple of my colleagues wearing<br>essentially petri dishes so those plates<br>all over our bodies that's what it looks<br>like in pretty dim light this is what it<br>looks like when we actually turn the<br>lights off yeah kind of kind of so it's<br>kind of it's pretty heavy you know it's<br>not very practical so I wouldn't really<br>recommend wearing this but it looks<br>pretty pretty cool so there is a few<br>other things that we've done with us<br>because you know we can actually show<br>this to people so why not do some<br>exciting things with them<br>so people who are actually artists have<br>worked with these plates and drawn<br>things like you can see on the top<br>left-hand corner there so we have these<br>temporary art exhibits where we'll get a<br>sus involved they can draw on these<br>petri dishes and then we can have these<br>displays because the place will glow for<br>about two days and then the bacteria get<br>a bit tired they stop growing and the<br>light goes out<br>so these temporary displays we've also<br>had people who are illuminated by the<br>light of the bacteria can take photos of<br>them it looks kind of cool we've also<br>done some 3d printing so what you can<br>see on the bottom bottom right there is<br>some 3d printed squid which we filled<br>with this bacteria and so they glow they<br>look kind of cool and then we've also<br>done obviously a lot of educational<br>stuff so because it's so safe we can<br>have kids playing with it so they can<br>learn about learn about bacteria realize<br>it's not quite so scary and it actually<br>looks pretty cool so we've done quite a<br>lot of things this is not a complete<br>list you'll notice that it stops in 2016<br>and we've already done stuff this year<br>and so a lot of different things a lot<br>of experience that we've gained from it<br>so we've learned quite a few things like<br>we've learned that those glowing 3d<br>printed squid actually linked which is<br>what which was not that great so we<br>needed to actually cover them with a lot<br>of glue so they didn't leak those large<br>petri dishes which are quite heavy<br>sticking them on the wall not actually<br>the easiest thing to do but you know<br>you're living alone what we consistently<br>got from the throw was it's safe it's<br>cool people like it why are we selling<br>it why aren't we actually making some<br>money out of us<br>so what we started off doing is we<br>started getting the involvement of the<br>artists who have been making these pick<br>these beautiful pictures and then saying<br>ok can we actually sell you know art<br>working things can we sell t-shirts and<br>stuff which has got these things on so<br>we've had this red bubble thing going<br>for quite a while week we can sell<br>pillows t-shirts and whatnot<br>but we can do better than that so<br>recently this year we started up a<br>company called bretons<br>I think it's kind of catchy I hope you<br>agree and so what we're looking at doing<br>now is actually selling selling the<br>bacteria in these little kits so each of<br>these little kits contains bacteria<br>petri dishes instructions information so<br>educational stuff involved in them as<br>well so people who use this not only is<br>it something kind of cool and a kind of<br>unique gift but it's also hopefully<br>teaching people which is important we're<br>at a university come on so that's what<br>we're currently doing but okay we can do<br>so much more with us so the applications<br>here things that we want to do we can<br>look at providing street lighting<br>providing lighting for buildings tea<br>lights we can look at seeing how safe it<br>is and seeing if we can put it into food<br>making glowing birthday cakes glowing<br>makeup pretty much anything you can<br>think of we can make glow and that'll<br>probably make it better thank you Thank<br>You Hannah that was really it was<br>illuminating wouldn't you agree<br>I was absolutely enraptured by that<br>because there's something so wonderful<br>about the combination of science and art<br>and creativity and then being able to<br>use that as a tool to educate more young<br>minds about science so from the dark we<br>now move into the light and we've got<br>Daniels own who's going to talk to us<br>about UV and obviously the issue for us<br>and New Zealanders how strong it is and<br>the the impact of that on our skin and<br>our health so Daniel was passionate<br>about tech and growth and we know this<br>because he's been part of the center for<br>innovation and entrepreneurship over the<br>last few years as a participant and our<br>student entrepreneurship program which<br>is called velocity so he has<br>devised a new business which is called<br>UV lens and it uses sensors and<br>algorithms and all together on an app to<br>enable people to be more warned about<br>what's happening in the sky and how it<br>will impact them thanks Mindy I'm hi<br>everyone so my name is Daniel and the<br>last couple of years I've been working<br>on my PhD and tech engineering but at<br>the same time I've been trying to grow a<br>startup company so I thought today I'll<br>kind of share a little bit about the<br>insights of trying to manage the both of<br>them both from an academic perspective<br>and also trying to be quite commercial<br>in our focus so when most people think<br>about academia research we think about<br>people in lab coats or doing science<br>experiments but actually it's more like<br>this<br>we do spend a lot of time I'm sleeping<br>catching up on sleep and part of it is<br>um where we get really passionate about<br>what we're doing working really long<br>hours trying to solve problems so in a<br>way is very similar to working in a<br>start-up and my PhD was working on a<br>technology a wearable sensor technology<br>essentially was used to measure the<br>human body motion for our athletes or<br>training athletes to be more efficient<br>we're using it for healthcare<br>rehabilitation you know I want to talk a<br>little bit about the intellectual<br>property perspective of the university<br>and partly is because we have a very we<br>have a very different approach in<br>Auckland and one that's very rare in the<br>world and essentially it means that<br>students on the IP and it means that if<br>you develop some technology as a student<br>and your PhD you own that intellectual<br>property and from there you have a<br>couple of options you can choose to<br>commercialize that yourself or you could<br>go through the university<br>commercialization agent uni services as<br>one of the things that I did with the<br>patterns that we did with licensure to<br>us a wearable company called Stretch<br>sense they've got about 50 employees now<br>I'm doing really well so and you'll see<br>a time when you're working on your<br>research and you're not sleeping or<br>lifting weights or so there's a lot of<br>time for exploratory side projects and<br>that's kind of how our business got<br>started me and my co-founder names was<br>here tonight we entered into a techno<br>logic competition run by Microsoft it's<br>the world's largest student led<br>technology competition developing<br>solutions aiming a big global problems<br>and the one about Sun safety about<br>people getting skin cancer was the one<br>that we wanted to tackle so we developed<br>this wearable wristband that captured<br>how much ultraviolet you're getting<br>throughout the day and gives you<br>notifications on your phone when you've<br>had too much Sun or in cases when you<br>haven't had enough Sun we tell you to go<br>out and get a bit more vitamin D so we<br>started off doing that the app is now<br>got a user base of over 70,000 users we<br>were featured on the New York Times<br>Apple selected us as one of the top acts<br>featured on the front store of 87<br>different countries we've now moved away<br>from wearable technology and actually<br>use a network of sensors here's men<br>putting one up it's got a whole bunch of<br>weather station sensors on it from rain<br>humidity temperature it's got a solar<br>panel on it so we use a network of these<br>sensors and also other IOT sensors to<br>form a really good database of what the<br>UV light UV is like throughout the world<br>along the way we've had to really<br>prototype really quickly so here is a<br>couple of them<br>midnight drawings we did on the<br>whiteboard and the next day it was<br>really important for us that before we<br>built anything that we would go out and<br>test the market and this is one of the<br>things I think research could do a lot<br>more is testing out whether or not there<br>as a commercial proposition out there so<br>I quickly painted the whiteboard drawing<br>onto Microsoft Paint phoned up a whole<br>bunch of priests kindergardens or<br>preschools which we thought well first<br>target market and we were doing<br>interviews the next week so we were out<br>there driving all around Auckland<br>talking to teachers trying to figure out<br>what is it that they like how will they<br>use something like this how much would<br>they pay for something like this we had<br>all of that data before we even wrote a<br>single line of code we found a<br>commercial partner a sunscreen company<br>banana boat sponsor the first 100 of<br>these kits to go out into preschools we<br>then went on to secondary schools in the<br>next year we would put on 50 of these up<br>around the country here's one of the<br>really cool things was going back to my<br>old high school and I'm a proud Maggs<br>boy and so too<br>since number one was at now number<br>Grammer meaning who installed a whole<br>bunch of these is also our videographer<br>and his own our own pilot who catches<br>all of the videos through our own media<br>I'm so along the way there was a lot of<br>technical challenges that we had to<br>solve one of the things we realized was<br>a real scaling issue and this was we<br>were we were at the day right this is 20<br>2014 I think we were building hardware<br>in the lad ourselves so men wrote all of<br>the software I designed the PCBs and we<br>were assembling these like middle of the<br>night and this is one of the things we<br>realized that we could not do what we're<br>doing in export to the rest of the world<br>there was just no way that we could<br>scale what we're doing and sell it<br>overseas and it was it was one of the<br>things that kind of really picked on<br>thought around what are we what is the<br>kind of business that we want to build<br>work with with our capabilities and we<br>started looking more into software and<br>we started looking more about how can we<br>build something that we could ship<br>global from day one they're wicked<br>wicked and push a button and someone on<br>the other side of the world can use so<br>last year we created a an image<br>recognition chat bot essentially as a<br>plug-in on messenger facebook Messenger<br>you take a photo of anything you like<br>like that beer you're drinking and the<br>the the bot could figure out what<br>exactly is in the photo we we quickly<br>hacked together a prototype we had over<br>10,000 people come on board and use this<br>it was featured on the magazine wired<br>and it was really a thought experiment<br>for us I was trying to we're trying to<br>figure out what can we do with very<br>little money in a very short amount of<br>time we're now currently working on a<br>couple of chat bot ideas and a I to come<br>talk to me afterwards if you're<br>interested in this area over my time<br>been really quite closely with the<br>university I was quite fortunate to be<br>given a chance to go over to Stanford<br>University to do more about<br>entrepreneurship and I think if you<br>imagine what this is it's essentially<br>Startup Weekend and an MBA and you<br>squish that down together in a month and<br>then you have this course so I spent a<br>month over there are working on a couple<br>of ideas developing this chat bot but<br>also getting a taste of<br>that's like in the in Silicon Valley<br>when people are living and breathing<br>startups every day I thought I take the<br>risk that this presentation and share<br>some of the thoughts I learned the first<br>thing was that people over there really<br>understand this idea of scale and it's<br>not as we're not trying to they're not<br>trying to look for problems that only a<br>few people have they're trying to do<br>true global problems and the night that<br>I came back to Auckland I was actually<br>at a software and networking event and a<br>couple of people were pitching for money<br>and one of the things that really struck<br>out for me was in their business plans<br>they were having revenue projections and<br>a couple of million dollars in the first<br>or second year or so I thought yeah<br>that's that's cool but this was<br>something that the guys in the u.s. just<br>don't even touch we when we were<br>brainstorming ideas over in the US we<br>were looking at things that we weren't<br>we weren't going to touch anything that<br>was the rule under a hundred million and<br>that was the kind of scale that people<br>over there think so really I want I want<br>us to think more about working with you<br>what are some of the bigger problems<br>that we can solve I think being here the<br>university is a really good place where<br>we can leverage some of this technology<br>like nanotechnology or sperm count my<br>sorting rate the stuff that like has big<br>potential<br>so think about scale the second thing is<br>really about how to move like moving<br>really really quickly and we thought we<br>were doing this already we were making<br>prototypes before we were building any<br>lines of code we were we were getting<br>upfront payments from customers before<br>we even like sold it to them but really<br>like over there is a completely<br>different story and one example was a<br>Design Thinking class we did we're<br>literally in the space of four hours we<br>would build prototypes out of cardboard<br>and polystyrene that kind of stuff and<br>then we're out in Walmart talking to<br>customers doing interviews getting price<br>like analysis data coming back and it<br>was that kind of like four hour<br>turnaround that we're trying to get<br>feedback and I think that's something<br>that academia or research could do a lot<br>more off I think traditionally we've<br>been holding too long onto our projects<br>we're not well most not failing fast<br>enough so in a way we want to move for<br>more aggression like they're doing in<br>the u.s. I want to leave with this idea<br>of them trying to summarize what I've<br>seen in both academia and working the<br>business sense is that in science and<br>engineering will science we're often<br>looking for things that are universal<br>truths we're looking for things that are<br>like if you look at a landscape it's the<br>tallest peak out there that's the thing<br>that is absolutely true and it's like<br>the perfect data we're trying to chase<br>after but that's really slow to get<br>there<br>whereas in business we're often looking<br>for what we called temporal truths or<br>things that are like a small peak that<br>we currently have that we can leverage<br>and really use that to build momentum so<br>we don't necessarily need to find the<br>absolute the best the thing right now we<br>just need to get something going where<br>we can launch and really get some quick<br>feedback that's something to think about<br>I think having gone through a lot of the<br>stuff is and hearing other people<br>talking like getting some feedback has<br>inspired me to come back and share some<br>of my learnings two takeaways from today<br>one is there's currently there's a<br>University of Auckland and dentists fund<br>there's a 20 million dollar fund<br>designed to fund support projects around<br>the university there's been there's<br>going to be a new committee it's going<br>to be a student-led committee and that<br>looks at student projects student ideas<br>so if anyone has got an idea that they<br>think have grown to a business please<br>come talk to us I've been fortunate<br>enough to being offered to cheer the<br>meetings the committee is going to be<br>consist of a whole bunch of students PhD<br>students so you're in a really safe<br>environment to come pitch your ideas to<br>is if you're looking if you're working<br>on chatbots or AI or anything with<br>machine learning natural language<br>processing come come talk to me where<br>we're interesting doing that in our<br>business so lots of lots of career<br>thanks Daniel and what an absolutely<br>rousing call to arms it was which is<br>great that you're our last speaker<br>because I think what you'll see from<br>Daniel's journey is that it's been a<br>journey that's emerged and changed and<br>evolved and also done that at pace and I<br>really agree with what Daniels saying<br>about the new student committee for the<br>Uni services and venters fund and there<br>will be a safe environment you've got<br>ideas and you want to see if they can go<br>to the next level but before you get<br>even there as I've got two ads to say<br>and then we'll get on to our panel first<br>of all if you do have an idea and you're<br>thinking about could this be something<br>could I take it somewhere is that<br>velocity is running their innovation<br>challenge right now so if you have an<br>idea that you can articulate in under<br>1,000 words which I think you'll be able<br>to you'll then be judged and you could<br>win a prize of a thousand dollars so the<br>entries close next week so you need to<br>really move with that if you are<br>interested and secondly the center for<br>innovation and entrepreneurship really<br>runs a master's of commercialization and<br>entrepreneurship degree this program is<br>a part-time course it's 18 months and<br>what it does is it gives you the tools<br>and the frameworks to commercialize your<br>science in your research but as well as<br>that you get to meet a lot of<br>practitioners so every week we have<br>talks from people in the business<br>community people who have set up<br>businesses and professional services<br>firms so that you're able to link the<br>leading-edge academic theory with what<br>really happens out there and the<br>capstone project is a chance for you to<br>deal with some very tough IP and to see<br>what you can do to bring it to life and<br>to commercialize it so if you are<br>interested in that come and see me or my<br>team or visit our website because we've<br>had an information session for that next<br>Tuesday</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
