6 April at the Auckland Law School, this seminar provides an opportunity to reflect on the unprecedented legislative and constitutional challenges faced following Brexit, and what can be done about them.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is Janet McLain and it's my<br>great pleasure to welcome you tonight to<br>talk about<br>brexit britain leaving the EU and we<br>have just been so fortunate in the law<br>school that in the same week we haven't<br>have two UK experts on the EU on brick<br>sirs on how it will impact on both<br>Scotland and the wider UK so with that<br>more adieu I it's my great pleasure to<br>welcome Professor Paul Craig the<br>professor of English law at University<br>of Oxford he's taught many of you I<br>gather and as well-known to New Zealand<br>audiences he's an expert on<br>constitutional and administrative law in<br>the UK he's written extensively on EU<br>law he's been an interpreter of EU law<br>for a British public and he's recently<br>been an expert witness at the UK House<br>of Lords constitutional Committee on the<br>great repeal bowl of which we'll be<br>hearing more my pleasure to to welcome<br>professor Ellen Page a former and<br>wonderful colleague of mine at the<br>University of Dundee he's written the<br>leading work on Scottish constitutional<br>law since devolution he too has been<br>deeply engaged in EU law and has written<br>a very influential paper on the impact<br>of bricks it on Scotland which has been<br>cited in a number of parliamentary<br>committees both at Westminster and at<br>Edinburgh so we're very lucky to have<br>people here at this time when the world<br>is changing so quickly and so rapidly<br>that no one can keep up with it and so<br>without further ado I welcome<br>Fisher Paul pray<br>Jenna thank you very much for the kind<br>of welcome I really like to mention<br>right at the beginning with normally I<br>didn't take the cause of red wine not<br>before what 11 o'clock in the morning in<br>anything of the great pleasure to be<br>here thank you very much indeed Adam are<br>going to divide up the general topic<br>side and Greg expertise in Scotland<br>Daniel knew you or more generally that<br>it seemed sensible tonight that we both<br>beat for about 20 minutes and that I<br>would talk about some of the general<br>issues concerned with breakfast and the<br>Allenwood focus in particular on the<br>Scottish don't mention abroad is and see<br>so what I thought would be helpful<br>because there are a huge number of legal<br>constitutional and political issues<br>concerning breakfast what would be<br>helpful I thought in the time available<br>and very had questions on any access or<br>topic for what it seems need to be very<br>helpful now would be if I gave some sort<br>of roadmap through article 50 and<br>through the different stages to brexit<br>and looking at the constitutional and<br>legal issues and the political backdrop<br>to them because that seemed to me at<br>least a way into this minefield of<br>different legal and constant<br>issues third sorting interviews as I<br>said I'm very happy to take questions<br>more broadly on any aspects of this so<br>article 50 was a new article in the<br>Lisbon Treaty there was not an escape<br>clause or drug laws before handles<br>debate about whether a state could we<br>draw the best version or the best you<br>about that Pacific wazzle was the state<br>could leave and that the rules about the<br>globe would probably be grown from the<br>Vienna Convention on the law of treaties<br>given that this world's or Edith the<br>master plan decreasing reputation but<br>that was no longer needed because in the<br>pretty much everything religion treaty<br>is actually taken from the<br>constitutional treaty of 2004<br>constitutional treaty was never became<br>reality because of the negative roots in<br>referenda in France and Holland but<br>pretty much anything new in the<br>investment treaty calleded from the<br>constitutional treaty including article<br>50 or the substance of article 50 hour<br>and 50 was first written and the idea<br>was not nothing will be used by escape<br>such as the UK it was used it was in the<br>best view from some judgment from Sir<br>John Kerr and giuliano amato<br>two of the leading light in the<br>constitutional premium the Constitution<br>clearly the idea behind article 50 was<br>that actually it was going to be a way<br>of kicking out the recalcitrant spit the<br>real ideas of the state started getting<br>absent without leave does it become too<br>autocratic then in effect what would<br>happen is that article 50 would be the<br>way to push it out the door rather<br>the state actually seeking to the<br>mainland with at midnight reporting the<br>time the statement citizen which can be<br>okay so that much just by way of<br>background said Ottawa 50 what are the<br>different stages in constitutional and<br>legal terms the stage one has already<br>happened Stage one is that it's for the<br>state in question to trigger article 50<br>in accordance with the constitutional<br>requirements of that state and that is<br>exactly what has happened in the UK<br>Prime Minister triggered article 50 on<br>the 29th of March having however had a<br>longer fight in the courts about in fact<br>what the constitutional requirements of<br>the United Kingdom were in its respect<br>the judgment ended up being given first<br>of all by the divisional court in the<br>Miller litigation and then it went<br>straight from the divisional court to<br>the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court<br>held by eight to three one powerful<br>dissent by law breathing particular that<br>it held by eight to three that the<br>executive could not trigger withdrawal<br>from or under Article 50 in accordance<br>with the constitutional requirements of<br>the United Kingdom the triggering<br>required parliamentary approval third<br>statute it could not be undertaken by<br>include the property it was lots of<br>controversial argument a lot of<br>contestable arguments put about this the<br>case rapidly became the most blogged<br>about case in English legal history and<br>a new record which will not easily be<br>broken in made history as well by being<br>the first innocence first case were four<br>days of Supreme Court coverage was<br>streamed continuously knocking<br>Coronation Street on Wikipedia offended<br>women into the TV ratings and AH the<br>judgement was given as I said it was 8<br>to 3<br>that was pretty widely predicted the<br>everyone in fact had predicted it would<br>give me 72 for rather than eight to<br>three people then wondered about well<br>who switched sides of the last moments<br>and that's not clear<br>my own view isn't fat a rather heterodox<br>view but I think almost certainly true<br>languages the Russian hackers of the<br>u.s. election and then were letting on<br>French election we feel and in between<br>have revealed need a new marshal : that<br>matter so they will be very busy and<br>they could only get there beating on<br>tubing hacking of reserves in mirror in<br>the Supreme Court and therefore they got<br>it one out you know seven for entry<br>aides not another big deal is that in<br>effect what happened now<br>lots and lots of argumentation a must<br>constitutional scholars about whether<br>the decision was right or wrong there<br>are two views about this good right and<br>wrong view the right view is that the<br>Supreme Court got it right by the<br>majority the wrongdoers that they got it<br>wrong I think that they did get it right<br>at anything that the issues of<br>straightfoward<br>but on the serious news I think we did<br>get it right and I actually do think<br>that they're not only got it right<br>analytically I think in actually the<br>decision<br>here's with one's intuition about<br>constitutional organization and results<br>in the following sense<br>if you think about it stand back from it<br>this was withdrawn from the EU whether<br>your remainder or exit here is the most<br>important single decision of a peacetime<br>nature concerning a treaty which has<br>ever been made by the UK now actually if<br>you stand back and think about in that<br>in that way the very idea in the<br>executive clear we had to do this<br>autonomously without a securing approval<br>from Parliament is actually quite<br>explored and it's quite extraordinary<br>that anyone could imagine that that<br>would be or should be the right result<br>in normative terms if they disbelieve<br>actually that's not the reason why I<br>think I got it right I think they got it<br>right because I think with the orthodox<br>constitutional reasoning the classic<br>limits on the probably apply and the<br>classic limits derive from the case of<br>proclamations and DeKeyser apply with<br>the consequence that the executive could<br>not rely on the profited in this<br>particular case and they had to have a<br>cost upon final word on Miller just by<br>way of certainly good interesting<br>political firmament<br>it was everything in this whole area is<br>an admixture of the legal and the<br>political I mean just everything so the<br>real one the interesting political<br>questions with the smaller and large<br>beers one case was over for and the<br>answer to that is simply not obvious the<br>Prime Minister didn't have to fund he<br>did she could in October or November<br>have gone to the House of Commons and<br>simply said I do not except as a matter<br>of legal principle that I have to seek<br>your authorization before triggering<br>article tivity I do not concede that<br>form but I'm going to seek it anyway<br>so you didn't have to<br>had to fight it legally illegal dividers<br>could not possibly have given her<br>anymore any better than odds of<br>fifty-fifty winning and that would be<br>putting it hard so she could she didn't<br>have to fight in this case could have<br>saved the taxpayer lot of money and of<br>course once you put things in the hands<br>of the court you never know what the<br>outcomes going to be equal to put it in<br>the hands of the court and as happened<br>when the Parliament did consider the<br>matter in late February early March she<br>could have produced in November exactly<br>the kind of feel that she produced in<br>early March a two-line bill with<br>precisely a hundred and sixty four words<br>if you really are going to be pedantic<br>about it and that's all she produced and<br>that secure package through both houses<br>of parliament and received Royal Assent<br>without a single amendment being forced<br>against the government she could have<br>secured exactly the same outcome in<br>November so one of the interesting<br>things historically is with 58 the 30<br>year rule was passed whether we find<br>documentation indicating as to why<br>actually she did bother to quite anyway<br>that's all stage one and that happened<br>so it's triggered so what happens now<br>what are the legal political issues<br>which happened next well the legal<br>clinical issues which happen next or<br>exactly the things going on there under<br>article 50 the next thing is that the<br>European Council puts together<br>guidelines for the brexit negotiations<br>European Council is the body'll in<br>European Union which consists of the<br>head of state the Heads of Government<br>the presidents prime ministers of the 28<br>member states it has a permanent or<br>semi-permanent president president toast<br>Toland is now in his second term the way<br>it works is the president tooth could<br>put together the guidelines or draft of<br>the guidelines you can't draft in the<br>committee it when you said in 28 so to<br>put together a draft of the guidelines<br>presenting it to the other 20 set to the<br>27 member states saying here is what I<br>think the guidelines for the negation<br>issue should be what those guidelines<br>are agree the actual negotiations are<br>undertaken by the Commission and the<br>Commission the person representing the<br>Commission is very seasoned very<br>professional and very clever man in<br>France Mathilde Varney a being skinny<br> negotiator is not going to get<br>an inch or anything else as it were to<br>to the British in that respect now the<br>position of the other European<br>institution or one of the other European<br>institutions is important as well the<br>European Parliament has no formal<br>position or role in the practice<br>negotiations there's an informal<br>position of formal rule in the breakfast<br>negotiations but it does have voids in<br>the following sense any withdrawal<br>agreement which is made and I'll say<br>more about the nature of the withdrawal<br>of Greenup in a moment anyone draw an<br>agreement which is made hat to obtain<br>the approval of the European Parliament<br>so the European Parliament's views are<br>going to matter and only today literally<br>today the European Parliament put for it<br>guidelines okay so the European<br>Parliament has survived and prospered by<br>doing what calm down in every country in<br>the world which is taking the power of a<br>god and use<br>as a graphic to get more or to maximize<br>their input so they know they have no<br>voice in the actual negotiations but<br>they're putting on the table these are<br>our guidelines and therefore they're<br>sending a signal to the other political<br>branches of government to say be careful<br>make sure you do not end up with an<br>agreement which transgresses the<br>guidelines which we are putting down<br>because if you do you do so at your<br>peril they have a bita all right if they<br>don't approve if they do to proven that<br>we told Nina that it something to<br>political arm-twisting with us it's<br>populated okay so that's what's<br>happening now so what's good what I<br>believe on the Dalits in stage three<br>what are the legal modalities moving<br>forward well what article 50 provides<br>for is at least two agreements perhaps<br>through but it provides but at least two<br>agrees there is a withdrawal agreement<br>and that's the main game in town under<br>article 50 the divorce okay article 50<br>is also framed in terms not only of<br>withdrawn agreement but article 50<br>speaks in terms of the further the idea<br>that while you're negotiating withdrawal<br>agreement there may also be discourse<br>about future trade relations between the<br>UK and the EU now so this is stage 3 of<br>our game as it were or stage through the<br>process now just to make it a little<br>clearer there's the make clear the<br>nature of these two agreements so you<br>have the read oral agreement on the<br>future trade relations agreement now I<br>think what's very important to emphasize<br>is the respective content of these<br>agreements in<br>fixed instead you could have a fat<br>divorce or withdraw an agreement which<br>was really quite meaty contained an<br>awful lot with the consequence that the<br>agreement concerning future trade<br>relations was actually relatively thin<br>by way of comparison<br>you could alternatively Hedison have a<br>scenario where the divorce agreement<br>withdrawal agreements relatively thin<br>and an awful lot is left for resolution<br>in the UK trade relationship work the<br>key criterion which determines the<br>fatness and worth de facto some illness<br>of the two agreements it's live if the<br>UK had gone for one is learning the<br>jargon of the trade as a soft brexit<br>solution if it had gone for a soft<br>brexit solution other things being equal<br>the strong likelihood that would draw<br>agreement will be quite fat and the<br>future trade relationship agreement will<br>be quite big why on the soft prepped<br>adoption the software adoption is<br>predicated on the idea that the state in<br>question modeled itself rather on the<br>model of Norway and the other states<br>which part of the European Economic Area<br>and states which belong to the EE a get<br>full access to the single market and the<br>customs union very much but the<br>quid-pro-quo is that they have to accept<br>the full rhythms of the four freedoms<br>including freedoms of people<br>Harper X appears have never been willing<br>to accept that but just still sticking<br>to the fact that infinitive into<br>agreements if the UK have gone down the<br>software exit solution if they have then<br>the withdrawal agreement will almost<br>certainly be modeled directly on the EEA<br>agreement of which there is a detailed<br>boilerplate there so a long preaching it<br>already exists you could take that and<br>cut and paste it you will put it into<br>your withdrawal agreement and that<br>there wouldn't be very much left to be<br>dealt with by a future trade agreement<br>however the UK has not gone down the<br>software exit solution the UK has come<br>down the road of hard bricks it's a hard<br>brexit meaning that the government is<br>saying no we're not seeking access to<br>the single market and probably not the<br>customs union either because that will<br>only come with the price tag of free<br>movement which the heartbreak city is<br>within the Tory Party and not we to<br>accept what that means in terms of the<br>relative content of the floral agreement<br>and the huger trade relations agreement<br>exists it is very likely this very<br>likely that the would role agree will be<br>quite fit it will be a quickie divorce<br>that it will not be simple or easy<br>quickly in the sense the content put<br>into the withdrawal agreements going to<br>be learned early small what would it<br>contain it will contain the financial<br>settlement at the moment there is a wide<br>gap between the two side the bill for<br>Britain's exit is somewhere between 28<br>and 60 billion more than ironing week<br>and and there's going to be very hard<br>negotiations about that sell but also in<br>that divorces other big issues the the<br>almost certainly the rights of EU<br>citizens in the UK and new cases in<br>Europe will become part of the divorce<br>settlement so too will important<br>institutional issues European Banking<br>Authority and the ene European Medicines<br>authority of both situated in London<br>they get any move they're going to be<br>pulled out and that's going to have<br>important consequences of various kinds<br>it's worth that we'll probably all be<br>included in the withdraw agreement<br>it probably won't contain much else<br>which is we might but I doubt whether it<br>will end up containing much else which<br>is why the P n our PM's bargaining<br>position is we want the UK wants<br>negotiation about withdrawal and<br>negotiation about the future trade<br>agreement to happen entirely okay they<br>know that the context of the divorce is<br>going to be relatively fit that<br>agreement they know the real gaming<br>sound in terms of future trade relations<br>and safeguarding position of the city<br>and all that and preventing a meltdown<br>of the UK economy is going to happen<br>because of the content of the tradable<br>which is widely what the to do in<br>parallel so we have not only a<br>substantive issue which is what the<br>contents of the respective agreements<br>there's also a further issue which gets<br>discussed third now as I just mentioned<br>the UK's bargaining position is we want<br>both of them discussed in parallel it is<br>not for Jersey but one of the very<br>headline issues that came up from tough<br>in the guidelines of the European<br>Council and the came out in the European<br>Parliament in their bargaining<br>guidelines is in technical legal terms<br>no way no way they said and the<br>formulation very but in technically the<br>Suttons world there is no way we're<br>having parallel thoughts going through<br>at the same time we are going to have<br>their viewers we're going to have to<br>have significant progress on the divorce<br>lick to exempt them before we even begin<br>to pick up any issues concerning the<br>future<br>relationship okay now just I know it at<br>the time it's just a word more of that<br>about this issue this stage three why is<br>this also important it's so important<br>because if everything if an awful lot<br>has to be done by an FTA future a<br>free-trade agreement of some kind then<br>one has to be mindful of the logistics<br>in every sense return of negotiating<br>FTAs now this only be known to everyone<br>but in case it's not let me just have a<br>few kind of basics on the table here the<br>average FTA is not a lizard applause<br>it's not a book at bedtime and it weighs<br>in at a chubby 260 or pages that is<br>actually quite small concerns of summer<br>are compared to some of the FDA's the<br>FTA between Canada and the EU weighed in<br>at about 1,600 pages all right not<br>rocket science to understand that the<br>longer the FTA is length is commensurate<br>with how ambition is how ambitious it is<br>the core of a free trade agreement is<br>about tariffs it's usually mainly about<br>goods and it's about tariffs and customs<br>duties and equivalent conditions for<br>trade the more ambitious you want your<br>Trade Agreement to be if you want it to<br>cover services if you wanted to cover IP<br>if you wanted to cover competition then<br>it gets bigger fatter and it takes<br>longer to negotiate average FTAs of we<br>the average FDA takes somewhere between<br>four and six years to negotiate<br>okay and there's evidence and that's<br>leading a sigh as needing the slide as<br>it were political goodwill or bad women<br>case maybe in this instance what that<br>all means is where there's a strong<br>likelihood that at the end of the<br>two-year period and ask for fifty has a<br>two-year deadline in it by which time<br>we've drawn women happy need or certain<br>consequences follow about each other<br>saying one word in a moment but<br>basically what that all means or the<br>linz is the following what that all<br>means if I have one minute so what that<br>means is but almost any they'll have to<br>be a third agreement called a transition<br>agreement now everything about the<br>nature of the transition agreement is<br>uncertainty just about everything it's<br>legal provenance is an service if the<br>legal nature is uncertain and it's legal<br>content is uncertain except everyone's<br>beginning to turn the knife is always<br>beginning to turn the knife in a nice<br>delicate way so the parliament is<br>beginning to turn the knife by saying if<br>you have a transitional agreement to<br>ease the passage between withdrawal and<br>the future trade agreement then of<br>course the European Court of Justice<br>will have to have full authority over<br>the terms of it which is enough to cause<br>political apoplexy amongst the back<br>benches of the Tory Party thirty Seconds<br>stage 4 stage for a cart horn and I stop<br>stage 4 there is a 2 year deadline if no<br>agreement is reached within 2 years then<br>what article 50 state is that unless all<br>the member states of European Council<br>agree to an extension of time we the UK<br>fall off the edge of the cliff that is<br>rights and obligations under a<br>northeaster apply at the end of that<br>two-year period which means that in<br>legal terms you do fall<br>to the WTM default position which would<br>almost certainly be very harmful to the<br>UK economy but if there is a reasonable<br>likelihood that we could end up in a<br>situation where no agreement is reached<br>and where we do indeed fall off the edge<br>of the cliff thank you very much well<br>good evening everyone and thank you<br>first of all for the invitation to be<br>here in Auckland with you and the<br>opportunity to speak this evening about<br>breakfast which is occupied far more of<br>my time and last few months than is at<br>all Crockett Paul has talked about<br>article 58 by one night all and I have<br>not highlights<br>let me turn around and look at it from<br>the point of view of what this all means<br>domestically for the United Kingdom with<br>particular reference as Janet said at<br>the beginning I'd like the implications<br>of some of the consequences for the<br>devolve part of the United Kingdom and a<br>particular Scotland something I would<br>like this first one is very beginning<br>when I say I'm talking about it properly<br>it's Scottish perspective I am NOT<br>talking about them from a Scottish<br>nationalists perspective I mop you to<br>beat John and for any particular cause<br>let me go back to the getting them a<br>little bit about the meaning of Bret's<br>what does brexit actually means because<br>after the referendum as Paul will<br>remember we went through a period of<br>several months in which there was<br>complete uncertainty as to what brexit<br>meant the referendum is in June but the<br>United Kingdom having voted by majority<br>to leave no one actually knew what this<br>meant<br>grexit means breathless<br>exit means red white and blue grexit<br>these were some of the meaningless Sun<br>whites that we attributed to in the<br>period between June and December and it<br>wasn't an act until a speech by the<br>prime minister at Lancaster House this<br>January that we began to get a clearer<br>idea what it might mean<br>and in the course of that speech she<br>said the following on court leaving the<br>European Union will mean that our laws<br>will be made in Westminster Edinburgh<br>Cardiff and Belfast and those laws will<br>be interpreted by judges not in lots of<br>work but in courts across this country<br>because we will not actually let the<br>European Union if we are not in control<br>of our own walls now I call that message<br>because the reference to laws made in<br>Edinburgh a kind of Belfast<br>and Westminster as that reference makes<br>clear taking control of our own laws<br>means something very different from what<br>it meant when the United Kingdom join<br>what is now the European Union in 1973<br>and the UK Parliament the Westminster<br>Parliament was the only legislature in<br>the United Kingdom the UK had joined in<br>1973 was a unitary state the UK they<br>believe is a one description estate<br>which is unitary but devolved Madhumita<br>the gronckle question I'm sure well what<br>is the significance of that divorce<br>part of the description what difference<br>does it make what does it mean well as a<br>matter of law according to the Supreme<br>Court in the Miller litigation with both<br>talked about it makes no difference at<br>all because as well as the siding that<br>the UK government could trigger on or 50<br>without buster<br>the approval of Parliament and express<br>in the form of legislation the Supreme<br>Court decided unanimously well on by a<br>majority that the UK government was not<br>legally obliged to consult the Scottish<br>Parliament on the eligible legislators<br>or to obtain an agreement before<br>notifying the European Council of the<br>UK's intention to leave now this a big<br>Court reached this conclusion<br>despite in Scotland's case a convention<br>for the Sewell convention not solely<br>author<br>despite the silken convention we're<br>inviting you K Parliament does not<br>legislate with regard to does not<br>normally legislative regard to devolve<br>Antos without the Scottish problems<br>consent having been written into the<br>start of that 2016 in implementation of<br>the recommendations of an all-party<br>Commission which was set up a bit early<br>after we cross the dependents represent<br>of the 2014 independence referendum<br>thoroughly changes to the devolution<br>settlement Janet tells me that this is<br>all the ridge it's on so all I need to<br>do is this mr. Alan L n so this is the<br>this is the viewership can we only see<br>this is the key provision of the<br>Scotland Act which as you could see<br>confer the power on the Scottish<br>Parliament laws of Scotland then it says<br>section 28 7 there in an affirmation of<br>the continuing solidly of the idea in<br>the parliament that this power of this<br>section does not affect the power of the<br>part of the United Kingdom giving laws<br>of Scotland and then section 28 8 is the<br>often suit what the Supreme Court said<br>about this was that in writing the<br>convention into the act the UK<br>Parliament was not seeking to convert it<br>into a rule which can be interpreted let<br>alone enforced by the courts rather than<br>simply recognizing the convention for<br>what it is mainly a political convention<br>and is effectively declaring this is a<br>permanent feature of the devolution<br>settlement while the convention has an<br>important role in facilitating our money<br>relations between the UK Parliament that<br>the ball legislature the Supreme Court<br>continued the police' Givens so the<br>managers operation what matters with a<br>political rather than the judicial<br>process all remove that might force in<br>cutting now the sound reaction to the<br>Miller case the Supreme Court judgment<br>has been to the effect that section 28 a<br>is not what the papers are not that's<br>not of you are shared or shared<br>certainly before the events of the last<br>two weeks because in my view convention<br>remains no less politically binding than<br>before so the question of the Scottish<br>Parliament's consent to the legislative<br>consequences of exit which of the larger<br>moment in my view is not only being<br>delayed not settled by the speedgrill<br>provision now whether that still the<br>case I think remains to be seen with the<br>last Thursday the day after the Prime<br>Minister's triggered article 50 the<br>Scottish customers sort of wrote to the<br>prime minister seeking<br>sanction for the second referendum on<br>Scottish independence and if I have a<br>question<br>it is followed by pushing the referendum<br>button and barely pressing that open<br>book referendum button early the<br>Scottish government may not have<br>deprived itself of the leverage which<br>the threat of a referendum would have<br>afforded in negotiations or the<br>implications of dread 6 for the<br>devolution settlement which I'll come on<br>to in a moment<br>the first let me say something about a<br>piece of legislation which is commonly<br>referred to as a great repealed of the<br>Conservative Party conference last<br>October the Prime Minister announced<br>that the next Queen speech will include<br>a great repeal bill I also have to pinch<br>myself and that total is used without<br>any suggestion or hint of tyranny no<br>notice intended to error or the great<br>performer hype that may be such a huge<br>put the column antics franchise on it on<br>a permanent basis on started reform of<br>the franchise but as announced by the<br>prime minister what this piece of<br>legislation will give you this key<br>things first we must got the largest<br>tube in the audience it will repeal the<br>European communities act 1972 which<br>gives effect to EU law in the United<br>Kingdom and so being able was done so<br>we've told our the UK politicians and<br>institutions ok difficulty with that is<br>that after more than 40 years of<br>membership EU laws woven into the fabric<br>of UK law to such an extent simply<br>repealing the act without doing anything<br>else would result in legal kills so the<br>second thing the Act will do not in the<br>interests of legal certainty will be to<br>convert EU law into domestic law Iovine<br>and UK law will be the same one minute<br>after midnight as it is one minute<br>before midnight on the day the UK leaves<br>the idea is then that will be for the UK<br>Parliament or the whole legislatures of<br>the case will be to decide which element<br>that not keep command but from the very<br>beginning it's been recognized and it's<br>become clearer and clearer is that not<br>all this such a you derive law will be<br>operable in its own terms<br>quite a lot of it will certainly make no<br>sense refers to EU law and for us to<br>even institutions refers to other member<br>states it will simply be inoperable so<br>the last thing the NGO will do will be<br>to enable changes to be made by<br>secondary legislation to law that I<br>quote they otherwise not function<br>sensibly once we like to eat you so that<br>our legal system continues to function<br>correctly so de you and one of the<br>consequences effective ever will be a<br>massive conserve legislative power from<br>Parliament to the executive some simple<br>doesn't appeal to God correct<br>it's all very shitty news they won't be<br>which is why the great repeal bill will<br>be accompanied by as many as some say<br>fifteen other bills making this and I've<br>been translated file Elms probably the<br>heaviest of the most substantial<br>legislative program since the end of the<br>Second World War so we're talking about<br>not just a great repeal bill but a great<br>repeal bill plus bills on immigration<br>tax agriculture trade in customs<br>officially data protection sanctions<br>must build on EU migrants reciprocal<br>health care arrangements or trade<br>nuclear safeguards emissions check trip<br>trading the transfer of spending from<br>various EU funds to individual<br>governmental problems one of the<br>scholars problems consent as I said my<br>here is that the question has been<br>delayed not subtle plug the middle of<br>case whether it's consensus upon a novel<br>depend obviously on the terms of which<br>the bill is drafted but the question of<br>its could settle inevitably<br>it seems clear now the part of the<br>devolved administration's are to be<br>altered Secretary of State for Scotland<br>has been reported as saying that is<br>spared to anticipate the great repeal<br>bill will be the subject of a<br>legislative consent pieces and then<br>there are all the other bills some of<br>which relate to devolve matters at the<br>same battles within the confidence of<br>the Scottish Parliament which could be<br>the subject of separate scholars<br>legislation or else legislative part by<br>Westminster with the consent of the<br>Scottish Parliament under the convention<br>now I have absolutely no doubt that the<br>UK government's preference will be to<br>proceed on the basis of consent but<br>whether that consent will be forthcoming<br>the Scottish Parliament's consent will<br>be forthcoming given the veto of a<br>second independence referendum remains<br>to be seen what is clearly if you can<br>recall section 28 something we stopped<br>the night and said this section does not<br>affect part of the I'm King and<br>Parliament to legislate for Scotland or<br>is clear as a matter of law that the<br>Parliament cannot by evolving its<br>consent prevent the great repeal bill or<br>any other bill in the decks of<br>legislative program or from becoming law<br>my final subject the implications of the<br>dilution settlement the referendum meant<br>that there was Scotland inside of the<br>referendum never really happened not<br>quite sure why Tom was possibly because<br>nobody actually spoke against the idea<br>that we should continue to be members of<br>the European Union we had a referendum<br>two years before done totally in mind an<br>element supporter fatigue and it was<br>also a sense of which this was it could<br>serve the thought the argument it's an<br>argument over the ball which could<br>really resonate in Scotland there was<br>little surprise level and when Scotland<br>on imported in figure of remaining the<br>weather was in the images after Martha<br>where the dog was what does this mean<br>for us what are we going to be able to<br>legislate about and you have<br>Josh Feldman running around rubbing her<br>hands saying you know this will be more<br>legislative class for us and I was asked<br>this with last button and last July to<br>give some advice and what we still<br>meaning for the compound's legislative<br>competence a piece of art that several<br>people said could not be done given the<br>sheer scale of EU legislation that fund<br>a way of doing it simply by mapping<br>scheduled find and stop the map is set<br>over the matters which are reserved to<br>Westminster onto the set of EU<br>competences the idea being that one side<br>which will reserve then old yellows<br>would fall logically to the Scottish<br>Parliament and I had no real P<br>conceptions of what I was going to find<br>when I started on this piece of work but<br>what I did find<br>to my surprise was that as I went<br>through individually you confidences the<br>vast majority of the massive reserved he<br>belong to Westminster<br>some will go to the Scottish Parliament<br>yes the ones that I identify the justice<br>and Home Affairs Agriculture Fisheries<br>environment on the two other minor ones<br>but we women diverse person services<br>capital negotiation and conclusion of<br>trade agreements with the non we've got<br>is all that ability at Weston's some of<br>the accretion of parcels clubs Poland<br>and we keep relatively limited question<br>so a scintilla wiser one should not be<br>and the answer of course is that it goes<br>really the thousand question most of<br>them turn out to be single market<br>related in other words that about<br>preserving the UK single market which if<br>you like is the center part of the<br>analog of the EU single lines so so that<br>is a fixable which are line which I came<br>up and I went on to make two key points<br>one<br>you just demand in southern act it was<br>stopping like wasn't to be amended and<br>the Scottish Parliament legislative<br>confidence would be exactly the same one<br>minute after that night so we gave one<br>man to for midnight on the day of evk<br>leaves but what we change would be that<br>what were terminology I use is nominal<br>as opposed to real what were essentially<br>nominal competences because of decisions<br>your meetings than were all taken in<br>Brussels at across shipping a very good<br>example to the Scottish government<br>Scotch doesn't simply came to the men<br>slots presided in Brussels needs me to<br>found real competences for the first<br>time I've used various language in which<br>to describe act of trying to get that<br>approach to politicians of various and<br>stripes on cool fat competence as<br>opposed to go back and look at property<br>in confidence maps as opposed to<br>competence white so I made that point in<br>the second point that I made was of this<br>in turn opened up the prospect of<br>different parts of the United Kingdom<br>riding off of different directions after<br>these cards and with the fragmentation<br>of the UK single so that's all I said<br>last August from forward five months<br>that Prime Minister speech at Lancaster<br>husband I mentioned and she said this<br>first of all note of all competences<br>would be resumed taken back from the<br>devolved legislatures I should be<br>equally clear that no decisions cuddly<br>take a body book of all the ministers<br>will be removed problem but the exercise<br>of the role competences you might want<br>to say should not result in you<br>valueless to trade so our guiding<br>controllably to ensure that as you leave<br>you know new barriers to living in<br>business within native creators since<br>they are not telling us or a little bit<br>short but since then the first of these<br>principles has all gone something over<br>revision it's no longer the promise that<br>no decisions color is taken by the<br>devolved administration's will be<br>removed from them instead it is<br>expectation that the outcome will be a<br>significant increase in the<br>decision-making part of each devolved<br>administration from the letter that the<br>prime minister said to colleges she said<br>exactly that<br>the second principle remains unchanged<br>so in the brexit bill white paper<br>published last Thursday the government<br>said as farmer we had rated it will be<br>important to ensure that the effective<br>function of the UK single market is<br>maintained now when I last spoke about<br>this to parliamentary committees at<br>Westminster I said we need to wait to<br>see how if at all these two principles<br>would or could be reconciled but taking<br>agriculture as an example I speculated<br>that one possibility might be a UK<br>Common Agricultural Policy replacing the<br>EU Common Agricultural Policy escape it<br>of all administration's at least as much<br>probably more freedom to tailor the<br>positive it also concerns than in policy<br>now conscience of Ronald Mallett we've<br>had direct appeal we'll buy paper that<br>was published last Thursday that a lot<br>of the article 50 notifications given it<br>is I think the best you can say about it<br>is a work in progress<br>very little of substance it's cooked<br>evident as a vast amount that still<br>needs to be argued or<br>if I had a crystal ball which or<br>something don't what I would have said<br>is what we what we'll see is some<br>impurity over a referendum which is<br>after all ASAP what resistance to any<br>form of power<br>what stop the power Scotland kids but<br>alongside that cooperation dictated by<br>the practical existences of the<br>situation is two-year clock which is<br>running down the fall talk about<br>Scotland after all these repos brexit<br>Agricultural Policy just as much as I be<br>other part of the United Kingdom and if<br>it's not going to get it from Brussels<br>we're out as we're going to get it but<br>London my born best gangster prevent a<br>UK cap Common Agricultural Policy which<br>will afford the drove administration's<br>at least as much freedom to adapt to<br>their own circumstances as the EU regime<br>what not to like with my reaction why I<br>first thought about this rather a lot as</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
