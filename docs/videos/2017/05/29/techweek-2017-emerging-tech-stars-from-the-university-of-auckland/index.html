The Emerging Tech Stars from the University of Auckland showcased how they are either inventing or using technology in an innovative way.<br><br>Presentations included:<br><br>Blood Spatter research<br>Ravishka Arthur, PhD candidate, Faculty of Science<br><br>Bloodstains are a common by-product of violent crime and the analysis of these stains forms a vital part of a crime scene investigation. However, no one method around bloodstain pattern classification claims to be fully validated and widely accepted resulting in qualitative and at times controversial data. Ravishka is working on how pattern recognition and eye tracking technology can be combined to build a novel bloodstain pattern classification system.<br><br>The small aspirations of a tiny turkey baster<br>Ankita Gangotra, PhD candidate and nanotechnologist, Faculty of Science<br><br>Research in science and technology is becoming increasingly multidisciplinary. The borders between science, engineering and technology are slowly fading. Ankita’s research uses tiny turkey basters to suck up some of the smallest parts of our bodies, to test how squishy or stiff they are. This could be a very early indicator of disease such as cancer. Come along to hear more about Ankita’s adventures in bridging the gap between physics, chemistry and biology.<br><br>Sorting sperm cells with lasers<br>Peter Hosking, PhD candidate and Project Manager for Engender Technologies<br><br>Engender Technologies, a spin-off company from the University of Auckland’s Photon Factory, is developing a photonic and microfluidic-based solution to sort sperm cells by sex. There currently is a gap in the market for an affordable and effective solution to this problem. Engender exploits minute differences in DNA content between male and female cells to determine sex via fluorescence. Advanced laser technology is used to manipulate and separate sperm cells on a compact and disposable microfluidic chip.<br><br>Living light<br>Hannah Read, research assistant, Bioluminescent Superbugs Lab<br><br>Bioluminescence, or “living light”, is the remarkable ability of organisms to glow. It’s the light produced by living creatures, like glowworms, fireflies and even some bacteria. Hannah and her colleagues have been using a safe and naturally glowing bacterium to illuminate people’s understanding of microbes. Using this technology, and their own microbiology expertise, they have developed an educational microbiology kit, allowing people to paint with bacteria and see their living, glowing artwork.<br><br>Digital sun protection<br>Daniel Xu, Co-founder of Spark 64<br><br>UV is an invisible radiation from the sun that causes thousands of deaths from skin cancer each year. UVLens aims to educate individuals by providing digital information and tools to teach people about UV and sun safety. UVLens combines a network of sensor stations with forecast algorithms to deliver live UV warnings on a smartphone app and help people balance their sun exposure. Daniel, Co-Founder and CEO of UVLens will describe how UV Lens is developing products to help people live healthier outdoor lives.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>our event tonight will be an exciting<br>show and tell of six emerging tech stars<br>from the labs at the University of<br>Auckland they range from doing PhD<br>students to early stage academics and<br>researchers so we've got Peter who uses<br>lasers to be able to slip zoom into the<br>different genders revista is a forensic<br>pathologist and she studies blood<br>sledders to help her solve crimes faster<br>daniel has newly sensors everywhere and<br>uses his app to help us understand when<br>it's time to get out of the Sun and kita<br>is a nanotechnologist and she's got a<br>fabulous story about how she works a<br>small particle to create quite an<br>innovation which is the world food<br>Hannah's going to share with us her<br>glow-in-the-dark bacteria that she's<br>created with other colleagues in her lab<br>they've commercialize this into a<br>science kit which allows people to learn<br>about bacteria and a really fun and<br>different way particularly pretty cool<br>I'm going to two more events tomorrow<br>between quite informative get to see<br>what other people are up to go to learn<br>how these guys diverge from the research<br>and commercialize the idea I really like<br>the road in different areas something<br>that everyone can find<br>I think I was really interesting the<br>combination of visualization and<br>research and how that happens and as the<br>performance it's been great having the<br>opportunity to hear those stories from<br>these emerging tech stars at the<br>University we love hosting events like<br>this because we know how important it is<br>to really enable networking amongst<br>different groups so make sure that the<br>innovation and entrepreneurship<br>ecosystem is vibrant and strong because<br>we need that so these ideas can become<br>innovations and then lead to commercial<br>success</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
