Short, Sharp speaker series University of Auckland Professor Kevin Lowe gives an effective and practical influence tool that you can use right away.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you for the introduction likes<br>working and looks like I've actually<br>never taught in this room before so if<br>you suddenly see me stumbling into<br>tables it's because I sort of forgot<br>there was a table here and I forgot<br>there was a table here and I got excited<br>and so please pick me up off the fork if<br>I go all the way down usually at this<br>time on the Tuesday night I'm up in room<br>325 teaching the NBA leadership and<br>ethics course but I can teach that<br>course with bluster lady<br>so Lester's upstairs doing heavy duty<br>this evening so that I could be here so<br>thanks to Lester and I'm delighted that<br>you're here we add quite a distance<br>interest in the session so it's exciting<br>I think most people are interested in<br>something about leadership most people<br>are interested in something about change<br>so we're going to spend a little time<br>talking about those two concepts putting<br>them together I'm going to go quite<br>quickly I have talked of an eight week<br>course four hours a week just on the<br>topic of leading change so we're going<br>to try to briefly go over in 35 minutes<br>what I know we've done about 32 hours so<br>it's going to be a bit like taking a<br>drink of water out of a firehose but at<br>least that will perhaps give you an<br>introduction to a number of ideas and<br>maybe even make you want to come back so<br>what that's what two of clay just a few<br>things I want to thank my benefactors<br>first and foremost you can probably tell<br>from my accent that I ain't from around<br>here I've been in New Zealand 15 months<br>I was recruited by the University of<br>Auckland business school into a pleasure<br>building employee education trust chair<br>in leadership and I'm delighted to hold<br>both of those affiliations I probably<br>associate with the University and<br>probably be associated with what you're<br>building this is what we're going to do<br>today and we spend about five minutes<br>ago spend another 30 minutes or so<br>talking to you reluctant to say talking<br>at you but I have to admit I have quite<br>a bit to cover so I'm probably not going<br>to take a<br>lot of participation stopping if<br>something's really really not clear but<br>there may be some time for questions at<br>the end then underneath about 20 minutes<br>of work to do at your table you have a<br>group exercise today that I'm going to<br>ask the tables to report out and then<br>hopefully in the last couple minutes<br>we're going to put a bow on it and say<br>what we think happened over the last 75<br>minutes so with that said how many of<br>you at your table you know everyone at<br>all right sorted all right so here's<br>what we're going to do first the first<br>change for tonight if I want you to say<br>going around the table three statements<br>and you have 33 seconds each of you have<br>33 seconds but if the whole table has to<br>run in four minutes and I want you to<br>fill in these blanks my name is Kevin I<br>spend the most of my time away from home<br>at the University of Auckland Business<br>School because I am a professor there<br>and I'm here tonight because a colleague<br>Vanessa stopped me in the hallway and<br>said hey Kevin would you do it short<br>chart and I said sure because I had no<br>idea what a short sharp was and so<br>suddenly I find myself here so what<br>we're going to do is we're going to<br>start in each table with the person<br>who's furthest from me so like you and<br>you and you and you and you and then<br>we're going to go to the left alright<br>thank you for that was that fun<br>good now when you get around to actually<br>doing the group work I hope that part of<br>what you learn during this session will<br>help you leverage the different levels<br>of expertise and experiences and<br>backgrounds and interests here so<br>there's actually a purpose in that<br>beyond getting you just begins to talk<br>to each other 20 percent sorry percent<br>40 percent if you've read this brochure<br>do you tell me anything about what those<br>numbers might need or one of those<br>numbers on the slide 20 percent succeeds<br>now we have different estimates of how<br>successful organizational change efforts<br>are the most pessimistic is that 80<br>percent fail and 20 percent of<br>successful the most optimistic<br>statistics we have are that forty<br>percent are successful and sixty percent<br>fail now a 400 percent batting average<br>isn't too bad if you're playing baseball<br>but if you're playing and you're gazing<br>an organizational change you want some<br>way to tip the odds above thinking that<br>40 percent is your best case scenario<br>and our number of processes and<br>procedures out there that will tend to<br>help tip the scales in favor of more<br>successful organizational change what<br>we're execs will change always be more<br>success well we'll always be successful<br>absolutely not<br>anytime you engage in a risky endeavor<br>and change is risky there are going to<br>be failures they're going to be mistakes<br>they're going to be trips along the way<br>but there are some opportunities to<br>change those statistics part of the<br>reason that we have so many sales of<br>change efforts it's just like this slide<br>suggests because a lot of bodies a lot<br>of collateral damage gets done along the<br>way and so one of the things that we<br>want to focus on is what is the people<br>aspect of change and how to apply to<br>people we just changed so in talking<br>about leadership I noticed scholar again<br>named Ralph's on the road 1974 there are<br>almost as many definitions of leadership<br>and there are people who have<br>define the concept and then Simon goes<br>on to provides roughly 400 definitions<br>of leadership now I'm thinking about<br>listing all 400 tonight but in the<br>interest of time I thought I'd just give<br>you a few and it's not discouraging to<br>me that we have so many different<br>definitions of leadership because in<br>part leadership is a big concept we<br>don't have a unified theory of<br>leadership so what we have are multiple<br>theories that give us different lenses<br>on the leadership challenge until that<br>old letter for of advice it's like<br>touching the elephant if you're touching<br>the Tusk it feels like a spear if you're<br>touching the ears it feels like a window<br>shape blowing in the wind if you get the<br>trunk it feels like a snake if you get<br>the tail it feels like a rope that's<br>what we get out of these various<br>definitions of leadership we get a<br>different perspective upon this elephant<br>that we call leadership so here's five<br>definitions I won't say randomly<br>selected but I think that are somewhat<br>representative definitions we see out<br>there in the leadership arena<br>the first one is directing and<br>coordinating the work of group members<br>well this is a real structural approach<br>to thinking about what leadership is I<br>sit and I direct and I coordinate and I<br>move the boxes around on the<br>organizational chart and I look at the<br>processes and that's one way to think<br>about leadership the second one is an<br>interpersonal relation in which others<br>comply because they want to not because<br>they have to so this person is really<br>focusing on the relationship aspect of<br>leadership more so than the structural<br>aspects of leadership the third one is<br>leaders jobs great conditions for the<br>team to be effective so what this<br>particular author is thinking about is<br>one of the climates with the<br>organizational climate for delivery and<br>what the leaders need to do to develop<br>climates the fourth one says that<br>leadership represents a complex form of<br>problem solving there's guy named Keith<br>grant and Ron Heifetz<br>who write about different types of<br>problems they talk about sort of<br>technical problems those were the<br>solution and equally known and then they<br>talked about at the other end of the<br>continuum they talk about what they call<br>wicked problems and those are those<br>sorts of problems for which there is no<br>clear solution<br>so technically leadership says deal<br>with these complex adaptive weighted<br>problems because for the most part for<br>more managerial more process approach<br>can deal with the problem solving for<br>static problem stuff and finally the<br>last one is the process of influencing<br>organized group towards accomplishing<br>and a key word is goals so that keyboard<br>if sort of ties into the second<br>definition others comply because they<br>want to but the fifth essence definition<br>takes sort of a process approach the<br>reason that I wanted to share those<br>different definitions with you is I'm<br>not going to say you should adopt this<br>definition as the best definition of<br>leadership I have my favorite one but I<br>realized it like any definition<br>leadership a single definition is<br>incomplete so I think it's useful we're<br>thinking about change to look at these<br>different definitions and say wouldn't<br>the lever for change that I see in that<br>definition and for me structure is<br>elaborate chain relationships are<br>leverage change climate is a leader in<br>change how we go about problem solving<br>and decision making is a leaper for<br>change and finally the organizational<br>processes we put in place or leavers for<br>change again I'm not discouraged by the<br>fact that we have these multiple<br>definitions of leadership because for me<br>that means that we have different tools<br>through which to engage in the change<br>now Rose you're in an academic place and<br>you're thinking oh god is going to go on<br>and on about the definition but I do<br>want to class these pretty quickly<br>together so when we talk about change<br>here's here's five not parallel<br>definition to put a fresh covering on so<br>that's sort of a minor scale change you<br>lay a cloth old wine and new models for<br>things to go from one phase to another<br>that's that process sequence approach to<br>change like we saw in one of the leaders<br>definition the replacing of one thing<br>for another<br>will now leave up the ante quite a bit<br>because if we're replacing one thing for<br>another<br>we have to say to ourselves what are we<br>getting up in the change process and<br>that's actually a place where many<br>organizations have a difficult time<br>managing change and part of that is<br>because they don't sit down and think<br>about what are we going to give up they<br>sit down and think about what we need to<br>do next and they just add that on to the<br>existing systems and of course then<br>they'll end up with cloud damage because<br>they get people too much stress that the<br>task is ambiguous there's a number of<br>challenges in that a fourth thing is<br>does this reverse a previously held<br>opinion or decision when we define<br>culture a little bit later in the<br>session<br>one of the things that we know about<br>organizational culture is it comes from<br>and I don't know Gordon still there<br>we're talking about British tradition<br>just before the session started culture<br>our tradition comes from something that<br>worked really really well in the past<br>and a consequence we teach everyone that<br>that's the right way to do things and so<br>if we look at the fourth definition of<br>change what we're going in is telling<br>employees is the very way we talk to you<br>- Jenna fittings we are now asking you<br>to lay those aside to abandon them to<br>get the Monica students unless again we<br>go back to the notion we're laying on<br>people and people are people so the<br>question is what are we going to stop<br>doing in an effort where we get a band<br>in doing and when we ask people to<br>abandon their cherished ways of doing<br>doing things how are we going to<br>compensate for the fact that there is<br>from Walter so some people likes the<br>distinction between leadership and<br>management this is sort of an American<br>view of the world<br>the Brits tend to say ah there's no<br>business this is employer shapur<br>management it's all management and<br>leadership is just a different part of<br>Management so I'm going to take the<br>American view tonight and suggest as<br>this is applied from a textbook that<br>says that leadership is about driving<br>change the essential elements that<br>separates leadership from management is<br>that leadership is about driving change<br>and management is about<br>controlling and implementing<br>organizational processes now which one<br>is therefore more no leadership or<br>management situation specific I don't<br>even think a situation specific I don't<br>think there's any place where one is<br>more important than the other because if<br>we think about those tasks what we've<br>done is they've got somebody driving the<br>change but something's got to pay for<br>the change and what pays for the change<br>is delivering on the current on the<br>premise well so if I go down to one of<br>my favorite distinction I got into small<br>letters here at the bottom that leaders<br>drain the swamp and managers fight the<br>alligators well draining the swamp seems<br>more noble but of course you get eaten<br>while you're trying to figure out how to<br>drain the swamp if you don't have<br>someone fighting alligators but the<br>chameleon is a virtuous cycle in this<br>notion between leadership and management<br>and that virtuous cycle makes managers<br>no less essential to the organization<br>than leaders so then why do we make the<br>distinction I think we make the<br>distinction because leaders are more<br>rare because going back to that first<br>notion you're going to drive change<br>you're taking your risk and part of<br>taking your risk is being willing to<br>fail publicly of Kevin trying to drive<br>that change and it's fail where it's<br>manager can perhaps sit back and say I<br>did my darndest to implement that change<br>but she or he just had the wrong idea so<br>it's a safe spot to focus on<br>implementation is the safer spot to<br>focus on control and if we go back to<br>traditional supply and demand diagrams<br>my personal philosophy is that's why<br>leaders get paid more than managers get<br>paid because they're getting a premium<br>for being willing to fail publicly so<br>what does change leadership if I take<br>those slides that I just put together<br>and argue that these five things on the<br>left and the five things great<br>is on the right it's about taking<br>structure is about taking relationships<br>it's about taking climates it's about<br>managing problem solving and it's about<br>using your influence to reverse<br>previously held assumptions to help<br>people abandon or laya sides or forward<br>behaviors and feel good about it and to<br>replace one thing for another<br>now some change is not quite as dramatic<br>as this particular diagram here we've<br>got a fish leaving one hole water for<br>another hole and often it's not quite<br>that dramatic but there are different<br>aggregations of change and there get<br>there for different time periods<br>associated with different change levels<br>so what we're going to do here in just a<br>few minutes to spend a little bit of<br>time covering three change models and<br>then I'm doing as I told you I wasn't<br>going to pick a favorite definition of<br>leadership right but I ended up pick a<br>favorite change model just for purposes<br>of using it disease and so change model<br>one is the old knee by building there's<br>a guy named Kurt Lewin way back in the<br>30s so I don't think anybody here was<br>alive this was 1928 and 1938 but they're<br>pretty old but he was a social<br>psychologist he gave us a syphilis<br>change model and in any ways all change<br>models that have come forward since or<br>different versions of this particular<br>model and basically we'll it argues that<br>were frozen in our routines for example<br>I'm pretty sure that when you get up in<br>the morning you always brush one side of<br>your mouth or the other first I tend to<br>brush the left because I'm right-handed<br>and then I go to the right I tend to do<br>the top before the bottom and I bet you<br>don't change those routines very often<br>similarly I suspect that the way you go<br>to your place of employment it's quite a<br>bit of a routine and sometimes you get<br>there and you don't even know how you<br>got to right you somehow on autopilot<br>got there because it's such a routine<br>behavior and so one says that we're like<br>that in organism<br>we're stuck in routine and I've got this<br>picture of a belt down here to remind<br>myself to tell the story I was on a<br>plane to Shanghai one time with a<br>colleague I came here from North<br>Carolina the colleague and I meant we're<br>in the middle the air were somewhere<br>over Amsterdam or Hollander somewhere<br>along those lines and he puts a magazine<br>in my life and he says dude you need to<br>read this and I look at the magazine and<br>the article title is tens fashion full<br>cause you must not make it now this was<br>obviously going to be feedback right so<br>I'm reading down the list of ten Patrick<br>oh cause you must not think it turned<br>out I was making three of them and the<br>first one I came to and the only one I<br>tried to change actually was it for men<br>your excess belt leather should hang to<br>the left otherwise it's bad feng shui<br>leadership so I reach down on the flight<br>still in the room right now is reaching<br>down and tugging on the belt and my<br>access that leather was hanging to the<br>right and some people will say to me you<br>know how did you get started doing that<br>I don't know I had a 50-50 chance to put<br>this or you're left handed no I'm not<br>left in any way so my excess belt<br>leather was hanging to the right and I<br>decided this is a simple thing to do<br>it's not an important thing to do right<br>so often people which you cannot commit<br>a fashion faux pas why wouldn't you<br>correct the behaviors so I'm now almost<br>40 years old and I decide to put my belt<br>on the other way how long do you think<br>it took me before it was completely<br>natural for me to put my belt on me<br>otherwise<br>nine to eight 39 days that's very<br>specific<br>mind you Jenny 28 days a year<br>see I'm an academic so by definition I'm<br>slow it took me six months before was<br>completely natural success think about<br>that let's say I started putting my belt<br>on it was score that's 36 years times<br>365 days a year<br>times multiple wardrobe changes I don't<br>know the numbers what is the big number<br>a root nice behavior and so in the<br>beginning I had my belt oh I get in the<br>middle of the day I might go to men's<br>room and I go to undo my belt and I go<br>got my belt on the wrong way and then it<br>got to where you know I I think about it<br>and I'm card though it to work and then<br>it was but in the kitchen when I was<br>having like my cereal at breakfast and<br>then it got to where I was conscious<br>when I just taken out a closet a<br>guarantee of rights gonna be Ryan right<br>very slowly but until it's completely<br>automatic it could be six months and I<br>tell that story because we sometimes<br>expect people to turn on a dime when we<br>watch a change effort and it just<br>doesn't happen that way as we would say<br>it takes a long time to unfreeze<br>people's current behaviors something so<br>the themes to dig down a little bit<br>deeper into the unfreeze then you<br>actually engage in the change process<br>once you've got it he sucked that in my<br>face and said Tim fashionable pause you<br>must not make that created in me a sense<br>that I wanted to engage in the change<br>and you're wondering right now were the<br>other two fashion<br>I'll give you one more the other one was<br>you should not wear a button-down color<br>with the three-piece suit now everybody<br>in audiences they know live and I've got<br>a couple former students here and if<br>they remember class they know the answer<br>the reason you should not do that is it<br>turns out that are but damn collar is<br>not a very formal collar and the<br>three-piece suit is quite a formal suit<br>and so you have in congruence between<br>the formality of your collar and the<br>formality of your six the more formal<br>that there's the more spreads of your<br>collar should be and hence if you think<br>about tuxedos a pendant has be sort of<br>open and spread so at the time<br>three-piece suits weren't totally out of<br>fashion so I got a couple chances to try<br>them out and you'll just have to wait<br>for the third another day so that's the<br>neat sort of only but Golding a second<br>one isn't by gaining Michael beard who's<br>at Harvard Business School the Harvard<br>Business School has been sort of a mass<br>cheon's of change leadership research<br>and so many of our models come out of<br>there being survived an equation he<br>actually has an 8-cent model of subset<br>model change that doesn't get referred<br>to a lot a number of people especially<br>engineers it seems like this particular<br>equation and basically his premise is<br>that you have to induce the satisfaction<br>and people give them a reason to want to<br>change that you have to give them a<br>model a vision of the future for why<br>change is going to make things different<br>and finally you need a process you need<br>to figure out how you're going to roll<br>out to change initiative how people are<br>going to get the information how quickly<br>or slowly they're going to be brought<br>along whether you do a corporate model<br>once or within a particular position as<br>you do with all functions within the<br>organization so you need this process<br>and basically beer says that you know if<br>you take these three things and you<br>multiply them if they're greater than<br>the cost of the change then probably you<br>should engage in the change if there are<br>less than the cost of the change and the<br>cost of things like relationships are<br>destroyed<br>reorganization here at the University<br>recently and people's job titles and<br>relationships were changed there's a<br>significant cost to that the reward<br>structure changed Who I am the group I<br>work with and who I work with changes<br>and to extend I need to rescale it<br>threatens my competence confidence<br>because remembrance but a lot of time<br>getting good at this particular thing I<br>do now<br>Systems Theory tells us that every<br>organization is perfectly designed to<br>get the outcome that it's currently<br>getting so if we're going to redefine<br>the system that means people are going<br>to have to be doing things differently<br>but I mentioned this with multiplication<br>why is multiplication important here as<br>opposed to addition or subtraction or<br>division if anything is zero so if we<br>pay attention to getting people to<br>satisfy and we give them a clear model<br>for the future but we don't work the<br>process we're going to fail so yes if<br>anything goes to zero it all goes to<br>zero well what do I think that that's<br>what people did leaders do in their head<br>intuitively but it doesn't find us well<br>it's a model to think about whether the<br>changes work engaging in whether you<br>touched all the pieces what you're<br>absolutely right if I have the Economist<br>down from the sixth floor they can put<br>you over old infinite and we could<br>perfectly say what it's going to be but<br>the omiai and the organization behavior<br>guidance agrees with you it's not quite<br>quantifiable but is the model to think<br>about you know do I have a chance of<br>succeeding and maybe I come to the<br>conclusion that no I need to spend more<br>time here or oh my goodness I haven't<br>spent much time on processes I'm such a<br>hurry what's the other property of<br>multiplication is important so if one is<br>this if anything zeros all those to zero<br>what's the other important thing about<br>multiplication as compared to say<br>addition and amplified one thing<br>amplifies another and so we can even<br>have some complicating on some<br>compensating balances here if we do some<br>things really really well it can<br>compensate to some extent for<br>doing other things very well but we need<br>to think about the whole equation<br>sometimes the door to your question our<br>notions are not totally rational for<br>example I walked down hallways on two<br>seats and my Teaching Fellow says to me<br>Kevin you need a haircut<br>and I said really and he said yeah you<br>know I know you're doing that short<br>sharp on Thursday night and you need a<br>haircut<br>so that created some dissatisfaction<br>means this is not a person who normally<br>is assertive and he's telling me you<br>need a haircut<br>so I'm thinking about how you have any<br>people in the room or however many<br>people here Jill loves Harry too much<br>Neil my boss maybe I shouldn't get a<br>haircut so but I worked through the<br>whole model and it came down to my wife<br>likes my hair before and we're going<br>away to the South Island tomorrow for<br>ski weekend taking a day of leave on<br>Friday and Monday and I decided that you<br>know all the things on the left side of<br>the model didn't matter as much the cost<br>of a change if my wife didn't like my<br>hair so I chickened out and getting my<br>hair cut - I want a fact 1/3 change so<br>the first one was unfreeze change<br>refreeze the second one is the equation<br>model processes dissatisfaction is a<br>greater the cost to take the one we're<br>going to focus on here tonight is a<br>model by John Carter also Harvard<br>Business School it's an oldie but golden<br>but I will tell you in my surveys of<br>multiple organizations they tend to say<br>this you know something's that broke you<br>don't have to fix it seems to work quite<br>well one of the things I respect about<br>Connors books is he's written lots of<br>different books and the best way to sell<br>a new book is to say I was wrong before<br>let me tell you the princess<br>and Connor always comes back and said I<br>went out to find that I was wrong and it<br>turns out I wasn't wrong I've just got<br>new examples for you of why I was right<br>now we might see that as arrogant but<br>it's also because he's getting a lot of<br>feedback from a lot of people that the<br>process seems to work and so Congress<br>says well why do we engage in change in<br>the first place any argues that<br>fundamental changes and how the<br>organization needs to conduct itself to<br>cope with emerging markets or changing<br>market concepts is why we typically<br>engage in change in organizations so in<br>universities we have massive online<br>courses coming on the horizon have lots<br>of different online education we have<br>providers relocating from different<br>locations all over the world in the ways<br>that we haven't 10 or 15 years ago<br>so we're experienced using the same<br>disruption that any other industry do<br>the technology and so we have to think<br>about how we need to change to adapt to<br>those particular circumstances so Connor<br>says the way you engage in change and<br>you'll be able to grip this in to<br>unfreeze trainings and refree he says<br>there's a stick process and he says<br>here's the bad news if it's large-scale<br>organizational change your timeframe is<br>3 to 10 years<br>I need such usually when I go in with<br>that message the CEO immediately wants<br>to throw me out of the office and says<br>we don't have three years to change<br>we're already six years behind so can<br>you give us some magic bullets that will<br>accelerate the process and Buchanan's<br>next two points are well know here's the<br>deal the biggest year you can make is to<br>skip the step that's the temptation of<br>many people engage in and the second<br>biggest error according to Connor is<br>impatience within the set now we're<br>talking about large-scale organization<br>change here we're talking for you to 10<br>years so if you're reading like the<br>Bursar's book when elephants dance about<br>this changing IBM we're talking in<br>complement those sorts of changes when<br>we talk about large-scale change so we<br>can begin in fact the timeframe<br>back some but I provide that statistic<br>team because my experience is<br>I went to an organization they always<br>want to know can we do it quicker can we<br>do it faster and they will often confuse<br>activity with effectiveness I was<br>describing an elaborate I did a couple<br>visitings at the University of Western<br>Australia once upon a time and I had a<br>guy who flew in every other weekend from<br>Singapore for an Executive MBA class and<br>he was talking to me about a VP of HR<br>position I described this elaborate<br>selection model that said you need to<br>take six months to hire a top executive<br>and he said Kevin the organization<br>doesn't have six months we've already<br>gone through four VP of HR over the last<br>two years and I said well why do you<br>think that is well he went on and he<br>said you know so it's even more urgent<br>now that we've hired a VP of HR we can't<br>take six months the organisation in his<br>work the organisation can't wait and I<br>said to him you've already waited two<br>years right for the right person all<br>you've got is employees who are now<br>hunkering down and assuming that the<br>next person you comes in with the next<br>Silver Bullet would get really good job<br>talk and talk about how they're going to<br>quicker than anybody else they assume<br>they'll be gone in six months - so we<br>always wait it's just whether we wait<br>and how we can talk to ourselves in the<br>alleyway so here's totters eight says<br>the first thing he says you have to do<br>is to establish the sense of urgency and<br>according to his research fifty percent<br>of firms fail on step one don't even get<br>half step one establishing enough sense<br>of urgency and there's a couple<br>different reasons for that one is I've<br>already mentioned we get to hurry and<br>sometimes people feel like corporate<br>policy change looks like this I'll<br>believe you're now required to carry a<br>hook at all times and adjust to it prior<br>to the completion of any past failure to<br>do so will be grounds for dismissal<br>because if they don't experience that<br>this<br>faction if they don't know through the<br>model for change if they don't<br>understand the process then it just<br>feels like another exercise in corporate<br>objective this diagram I decided I think<br>is very useful and this helps to think<br>about the sequencing of the change<br>effort in an organization now who are<br>the smartest people on any company so<br>sorry the operator I don't tell the<br>answer for sure but I would like to<br>sitting with my rose-colored glasses on<br>that often the best and the brightest<br>people rise to the top of the<br>organization but with the thin they go<br>from let's assume by lowering the levels<br>your organization are roughly equal in<br>talent then we play different roles and<br>one of top management's role is to be<br>outfit facing to be scanning the<br>environment to see what's coming next to<br>engage with other CEOs to talk to<br>Margaret leaders so tough to other<br>businesses their job is to be outward<br>facing so it makes sense that they would<br>see change first and they also have the<br>most power to drive change like to have<br>the most formal power and often the most<br>influence and so this particular model<br>there is called the Sarah model shock<br>and your rejection exception it came out<br>of the death literature but if you go<br>back to our definitions of change part<br>of change was laying aside or abandoning<br>something so something's got to die for<br>us to really engage in large-scale<br>change and if you think about that then<br>it makes sense that people might go<br>through the process at different<br>intervals because the comp of the<br>organization is that what they thing<br>they see the change that think about the<br>change they begin to implement the<br>change their thinking about those<br>processes for thinking about what the<br>vision looks like as you see here you've<br>got they'll management then perhaps<br>inform and even though some frontline<br>employees are outward facing there is<br>still of what they see tends to be very<br>narrow and so they're being integrated<br>into a fair<br>large scale change effort and so if you<br>think about what this looks like over<br>time and then we have different<br>sequencing then what you really have is<br>what I might one here the commitment<br>game so if you think about getting out<br>and I'm just peaceful is the screen<br>since I'm close to it if we assume that<br>everybody goes through this an equal<br>amount of time and what you have is by<br>the time top management is said and I<br>hate that we have to get into this large<br>scale changer hey the markets are<br>changing so maybe they don't hate it but<br>you know I realize it's going to be<br>traumatic or challenging to the<br>organization when they are finally<br>accepting it when you get up to the<br>middle managers where are they in their<br>emotional cycle there any rejection and<br>the frontline employees are what matters<br>health right but we're all human and<br>when we get clear on something we<br>usually want everybody else to get clear<br>on and we forget that it takes everybody<br>else as long to go through the cycle is<br>it does up so we often get at this<br>particular thing a lot of turmoil lots<br>of resistance in the organization<br>because you've got this difference in<br>where people are on the cycle and I<br>argued a few minutes ago that maybe the<br>smartest people and the most talented<br>people who make the most political<br>people get to the top of organization if<br>that's true then each curve is I go from<br>left to right should get wider it should<br>actually take middle managers longer to<br>get there then cop manager it should<br>take line workers the longest time to<br>get here so this is in some ways the<br>most optimistic scenarios of what the<br>committed staff might be and we often<br>see organizations that people are mad<br>because they go we had work for six<br>months behind we're six years behind<br>these people need to get on this dick<br>well they are going to get on the sixth<br>they just need as much time as the<br>people above demand get on sticks and so<br>if we don't acknowledge that in color<br>would argue that that's one of the<br>reasons that stasis reagent in here is<br>we need the sequencing the process for<br>this to roll out so this is just these<br>are figurines you divide the line<br>percent<br>dollars I don't double so I'm not<br>pushing them this was the shock anger<br>rejection acceptance and that this one<br>these people that is healing<br>according to the nectar eunuch said this<br>is actually a healing process during the<br>Asian gift sirs so if you want to sit<br>these on your desk and visit of around<br>every day but I like this as a visual<br>because I think about that staging if I<br>don't wait for everybody to get to the<br>acceptance stage but I've got different<br>people sitting at their desk feeling<br>different ways about what we're trying<br>to do and it makes it visually at least<br>appealing to me that know why it might<br>be hard to get there so I'm trying to<br>talk a little bit I'm relevant going<br>fast and I'm trying to talk about<br>leadership change of some of these<br>models I'm sorry Africans go back see<br>adjustments so the other steps change<br>the second changes step is performed the<br>powerful guiding coalition and the<br>reason that I want to uh to get back to<br>this is this has little to do with the<br>formal hierarchy powerful coalition here<br>means who really have input who do<br>people go to as the sense makers for<br>what's going on in organizations on my<br>hallway there are maybe six people have<br>exactly the same job title but one of<br>them is the ringleader so to speak I<br>know if I can influence her opinion the<br>other five are going to come along that<br>way so whether you get there through<br>network analysis or whether you get<br>there just for tangible observations<br>knowing who those influencers are that's<br>what they're talking what color talking<br>about in terms of forming a powerful<br>coalition if I guess Jim Collins this<br>language is getting the right people on<br>the bus just forming that powerful<br>coalition until we have a fifty percent<br>failure rate as its first set of either<br>because people feel like good jumping or<br>we haven't allowed enough time for the<br>change they roll through then if we<br>don't form the powerful guiding<br>coalition we're not managing the<br>conversation if all we do is look at the<br>organizational chart can bring a lousy<br>piece in the room we're not really<br>managing the conversation because we<br>haven't<br>ask yourself are the VP's really the one<br>with the influence and then it's<br>interesting that the third step is<br>creative is right so most people think<br>I've got to get division first well you<br>probably need to identify the problem<br>first<br>but it's that powerful coalition ship<br>can help you identify what solution is<br>possible so they may get a visions it's<br>not actually implementable if my wife<br>were here she would say yeah all the<br>time so it's about getting that powerful<br>coalition I might have a strong model<br>for what the vision is but I actually<br>want to engage that powerful coalition<br>in a conversation about what the vision<br>looks like because unless I do that<br>they're unlikely to use their influence<br>and sometimes these people are some of<br>you would consider a protagonist<br>sometimes you need a union leader at the<br>table when you really don't want to<br>union leader at the table because again<br>you're trying to manage the meaning in a<br>very excluded from the conversation you<br>can be sure they will but it the last<br>thing and I'm not to do all these steps<br>with is communicate divisions I've got<br>the magic number seven down here for two<br>reasons<br>um I just imagine understood you know<br>what's the magic number seven that there<br>are seven digits in a u.s. phone number<br>how many are there in an awesome phone<br>number they got that first nine step do<br>you know how to this a guy named Douglas<br>great was the social psychologist for<br>the AT&amp;T corporation did a bunch of<br>studies on what people can remember and<br>he wrote an article called the magic<br>number seven plus or minus it because<br>they found that most people can remember<br>seven this means this five and a few up<br>to nine and that's why your your phone<br>number is seven digits because they look<br>great that should be and he also<br>discovered the people hold information<br>and packets typically is three to four<br>digits and that's why you send to has<br>that - in the middle and then the front<br>of that maybe an area code or city code<br>and country code so all that comes from<br>a 1945 article by some guy who was<br>sitting at AT&amp;T when someone says how<br>many members should be so coming back to<br>magic number seven Jack Welch says a GE<br>and I didn't get this directly from him<br>of course Jack and I are not friends but<br>I did spend a fair amount of time Lou<br>gunning speaker who ran Gigi's HR<br>operations and went ahead talent<br>management at Goldman Sachs and things<br>that here's the deal you need to tell<br>people seven times so tell people<br>something seven times before they hear<br>it so because usually you say it the<br>first time and they go oh and expect the<br>second time and sort of bounces off of<br>them because there's lots of competing<br>messages and organizations and then<br>about the third or fourth time you say<br>have to go hmm seems like I've heard<br>that before<br>and the fourth and fifth time I hear as<br>they say that keeps coming up I better<br>pay attention to it and the sixth or<br>seventh time to hear if they go and this<br>must be real I keep hearing it<br>everywhere I go now you may have grown<br>up with my mother for instance don't let<br>me tell you again right but it doesn't<br>work that way in corporate<br>communications we've got to tell people<br>things seven times<br>till they're so sick of hearing it they<br>believe that that change messages that<br>are sick the other magic of seven is you<br>probably need seven different ways to<br>communicate the message so let's press<br>some of this video some of it's a simple<br>message like freeze unfreeze simple<br>model for simpler people and by simpler<br>I mean let's deter in the organization<br>so we need probably seven different ways<br>to think about communicating and making<br>culture I'm going to go really quick<br>here because I want to spend most of my<br>time on leading change and I do want to<br>put you to work soon Connor says that<br>the more of the culture is externally<br>oriented your non-bureaucratic and<br>encourages leadership at all levels the<br>easier will be to succeed with the<br>eight-day process so you can gauge your<br>own organization against that criteria<br>perhaps and say are we externally where<br>are we non-bureaucratic do encourage<br>leadership at all levels and if you say<br>yes you don't work for a university I<br>promise although we do some things very<br>well so going back to notes the culture<br>I mentioned earlier these definitions<br>kind of heard the feed from where you<br>are but again culture comes from the<br>fact that we have taught people that<br>this is the right way to do things we<br>brought people in the organization I<br>worked in finance for utility company<br>one time and you know I was told we wear<br>white shirts that was one of the<br>identity things and you can come in at a<br>light blue shirt they do like the still<br>Mandela like here and I meet in the<br>elevators maybe like July first year<br>this morning they like bluntness if we<br>have on a light blue shirt don't you<br>know you're supposed to wear a white<br>shirt and so I had to decide whether I<br>looking form or not and you can<br>speculate on what I'm going to done so<br>we talked about culture there's lots of<br>different ways to talk about culture I'm<br>going to describe one particular model<br>this comes from Cameron and Quinn's<br>who've been doing a lot of cultural<br>research over the years at the<br>University of Michigan and they say that<br>you know a lot of different ball valves<br>sort of come back to this notion of<br>things that typically you can think<br>about organizations on two dimensions<br>they're focused on stability and control<br>versus flexibility and discretion or<br>their externally focused or they're<br>internally focused and from that notion<br>of internal versus external and<br>flexibility versus stability we can<br>label cultures or laws is a very simple<br>diagram in these ways a clan or extended<br>family a lot of mentoring lot of<br>nurturing a lot of participation all the<br>way down to a mark<br>orientation and what I can tell you<br>about cultural changes is that moving to<br>an adjacent box in these are the moving<br>to a diagonal box so for example I was<br>working with an organization not too<br>long ago and I gave them the survey and<br>said what is your organization now and<br>then I haven't answered the question<br>what does your organization want to be<br>and they were clearly a clan culture and<br>they were clearly getting the messages<br>that they needed to be a market-oriented<br>culture and so the question then became<br>are you clear about the process to get<br>there go back to that model<br>dissatisfaction and they were not either<br>dissatisfied enough to really be engaged<br>in the changes and they were not clear<br>on the process to get there so the level<br>of commitment to change was not very<br>high in this particular organization<br>because the process has been mismanaged<br>so again living from planning and hard<br>to see or a hierarchy to market is<br>easier than making and L finally and I<br>think about the last place I've got is<br>we think about levers of change that's -<br>is an oligo model that seems to work<br>quite well this is the McKinsey 7s<br>framework fundraising works well as<br>people find it easier to remember 7 SS<br>than lots of difference on acronym the<br>McKinsey talks about strategy<br>structuring systems as the hard knowable<br>things and organizations and therefore<br>the easiest to do coming up with a<br>strategy intellectually is easier to do<br>than actually developing the staff and<br>the style and the skills the shared<br>values so again they say the gold<br>circles here is so-called soft skills<br>are harder and the so-called hard skills<br>are easier when we think about<br>organization change but certainly we can<br>think about these as labors of change<br>this is just a picture the counter model<br>which I'm about to hand you in just a<br>moment and how am i doing<br>too bad so I go back resisting I mention<br>the seven times for seven audiences so<br>hope you'll think about that and finally<br>I don't do so much not enough about this<br>but when we lay something aside when we<br>abandon something that's made it<br>successful in the past I think it's<br>important to pay tribute to that to go<br>through and recognize that there should<br>be a bit of a mourning process and we<br>should celebrate that this is the thing<br>that got us there and we should then<br>celebrate that we're smart enough to<br>know it won't keep it there so that said<br>I'm deaf and I often change the<br>difficult well the old saying goes not<br>changing it is they so thanks for your<br>time and attention and if there are any</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
