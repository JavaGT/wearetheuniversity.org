we'll<br>celebrate our best and our brightest our<br>students have excelled over the past 12<br>months we'll recognize our student<br>leaders will congratulate the students<br>who have won our competitions and it<br>represents the Auckland Law School<br>nationally and internationally we will<br>mark the achievements of our students<br>who've won prizes and scholarships what<br>they all have in common is hard work<br>commitment perseverance interest and<br>enthusiasm for the law I'd like to<br>welcome all the students here tonight to<br>a receiving award you've done well and<br>the members of the faculty here tonight<br>join me in congratulating you on your<br>achievements I'd like to welcome family<br>members and close friends of our<br>students who are able to be here this<br>evening our students wouldn't have<br>achieved their success without your<br>support your encouragement and your love<br>you can be very proud of all they've<br>achieved and in knowing that you've<br>helped make their success possible I'd<br>like to welcome many of the individuals<br>and representatives of firms and<br>organizations who have donated prizes<br>and scholarships for our best students<br>who supported our student societies and<br>the events and competitions they<br>organize and have given financial<br>assistance to the law school and to what<br>we seek to achieve we are immensely<br>grateful prizes the scholarships and the<br>donations you provide mean a lot to our<br>students they recognize their hard work<br>the our spins and libraries staying up<br>late before exams seeking to master<br>particular cases legal principles and<br>whole areas of the law this is a very<br>successful law school nationally and<br>internationally we're very proud of our<br>students and we're very grateful for the<br>support that many of you here tonight<br>have given us I'd like to welcome the<br>members of the legal profession<br>and the judiciary who are also here<br>tonight we're very grateful for the<br>support you also provide to us not only<br>in financial terms but also by helping<br>and mentoring our students adjudicating<br>MOOCs and competitions and supporting<br>student and faculty activities the<br>format of tonight's award ceremony is<br>that the awards will be presented in<br>groups so I will invite the groups in<br>the order that they are in the program<br>on your tables so I'm by each group to<br>come forward and together here on the<br>left hand side of the stage and so that<br>you could gather in the order that you<br>are mentioned in the program and when I<br>call your name if you then come forward<br>to the stage the steps are just here so<br>if you come forward shake my hand and<br>then if you proceed to the deputy Dean<br>she will give you your certificate and<br>that's the moment at which audience<br>members can congratulate you as you come<br>forward but once you have received your<br>certificate you could then move to the<br>other side of the stage because at the<br>end of each group presentation would be<br>a brief moment when we will take a<br>photograph of the group as a whole and<br>that I suppose will be another chance<br>just to congratulate that particular set<br>of students for what they have achieved<br>so I'm sure we'll all get the hang of it<br>once the first group of students start<br>the process and so I'd invite at this<br>point are those who are mentioned as<br>student leaders in the program if you<br>could come forward and in the order of<br>the program a symbol are just here to my<br>right or to the left of the stage and if<br>as they are doing so sort they could<br>come forward now as they're doing so<br>I'll just mention are the organizations<br>the student societies that they<br>represent the Auckland University Law<br>student Society is one of the most<br>active and successful law student<br>societies in the country it organizes a<br>wide range of competitions seminars<br>workshops sports and drink social events<br>for the students<br>Torico Tory is our society which<br>provides support and community for our<br>Maori law students so it's very<br>important for our new Maori law students<br>to feel welcome and feel that there are<br>senior students they can talk to and be<br>mentored by and one example of this is<br>the annual hiring er that our Maori Law<br>Students organised to go and speak at<br>schools and rural areas of New Zealand<br>about the merits of coming to university<br>and studying law the Pacific Island Law<br>Students Association<br>similarly provides community and support<br>for Pacific Ireland students and just<br>recently has had their first event for<br>the year where over 70 of their members<br>are took part on their start of year can<br>Rainbow law is the society established<br>to provide community and support for our<br>lesbian gay bisexual and transgender<br>students the equal justice project over<br>many years has involved hundreds of our<br>students in providing free legal<br>assistance for people and organisations<br>who would not otherwise receive access<br>to the law and partnership with<br>community groups and the legal<br>profession the Auckland University Law<br>Review is an entirely student-run<br>high-quality legal journal and that<br>involves are the editors and chief are<br>responsible for ensuring that a very<br>large team of students do all the<br>reading editing and publishing of that<br>journal to a very high standard the Law<br>Review not to be mentioned with the<br>Auckland University Law Review the Law<br>Review involves a large number of<br>students taking to the stage each year<br>to sing dance satire and otherwise<br>Lampoon various aspects of the laws and<br>the legal profession I think one year<br>recently one of their video clips<br>received I think about 5 million<br>downloads somewhat more probably impact<br>in terms of people are seeing what they<br>did and many of the articles that are<br>academics publish the looting Society<br>was established several years ago to<br>promote in advance<br>looting competitions and learning about<br>looting<br>in the law school and has over 700<br>members of so very many of our students<br>take part in their activities and we'll<br>see later other successes that have been<br>achieved in many ways partly as a result<br>could be first thank and congratulate<br>in the educational vice president's<br>firstly Liddy Buckley and Liddy both<br>look about can't be with us or have gone<br>to the wrong venue Lindell in both of<br>them well at least hopefully they're<br>together doing something to advance the<br>cause of education and the law school<br>the territory code to Milwaukee if we<br>first get thanked to there are two<br>co-presidents of Terra Cotta Tereza Mary<br>Law Students Association<br>Alex grieves<br>and also Kimberly Murray improving a<br>distressing feature of our student<br>leaders they're so busy working on<br>student causes they forgot to give their<br>apologies that we shall learn punish<br>them later if we come on to the Pacific<br>Island Law Students Association we have<br>little bit like an Oscars gone<br>dramatically wrong but hopefully we<br>won't present the wrong awards to anyone<br>so with a certain measure of Hope in my<br>voice I will call upon Rainbow Lord<br>equal justice project director Jade<br>McGrath law review editor Kaley ensel<br>and the singing and dancing law review<br>we have directors Tom Blackwell Paige<br>Coulter and Robbie hind and moving<br>society president James pin<br>you'll see that the photographs after<br>each group give you the opportunity a<br>thoughtful opportunity to replenish the<br>food and drink or at least about take of<br>more of the food and drink in front of<br>you we now come to the competition<br>winners and representatives and asked if<br>the winners of the Auckland law school<br>competitions would come up to the stage<br>so that's everyone who has won a law<br>school competition but not including our<br>the international competition<br>representatives will be the next groups<br>up until the Ministry of Justice<br>sentencing competition and if what these<br>awards are doing is there recognizes in<br>fact that every year we have very large<br>numbers of our students compete in all<br>sorts of competitions which help them<br>learn and develop the sort of skills<br>that we really valuable as lawyers so<br>they take part in witness examination<br>negotiation client interviewing and<br>mooting competitions I should mention<br>that a MOOC is effectively a mock court<br>case on a point of law so in some ways<br>it's the closest experience to appearing<br>in a court to argue a legal issue and<br>that's why we have quite a number of<br>mooting competitions in the law school I<br>would like to think the loss of firms<br>who sponsor these competitions and<br>support the costs of our sending the<br>winners of them to represent the law<br>school in New Zealand and Australian<br>competitions first up if we congratulate<br>the winners of the battle Findley senior<br>negotiation competition firstly Michael<br>Green<br>figure out Monday okay and also on the<br>carry<br>luckily the Buddle Findlay

jr.<br>client interviewing competition<br>and Sam Britnie winner of the mentor<br>elephant rug wats witness examination<br>competition Antonio Bradley winners of<br>the Bryan Shinken family law

Matheson and also grant<br>allow winners of the junior mooting<br>competition Michael great tricks and<br>Lisa dick and we established several<br>years ago and the mooting society when<br>Stroh mental and establishing this<br>competition but the we also had a lot of<br>contributions particularly from the<br>class of 1970 towards the John Hay QC<br>memorial mooting competition this is the<br>intermediate level routing and the<br>winner of that is Thomas Liggett<br>the winner of the merit of Connell green<br>give Arad Memorial Prize for looting may<br>already be on the stage Michael

have<br>represented the often law school and<br>international competitions to assemble<br>on the side of the stage and I know that<br>some of them will have already been up<br>because of having one Auckland Law<br>School competitions but again obviously<br>those who take the next step forward and<br>get to represent Auckland or indeed in<br>some cases New Zealand internationally<br>have done incredibly well knew the<br>awkward law school again last year our<br>team that won a team that was selected<br>on the basis of our mooting competitions<br>to represent us in the New Zealand<br>mooting competitions won that<br>competition and I think that's worth<br>noting that that was the ninth time in<br>the last 10 years that Auckland has won<br>the National meeting competition so I<br>think it is a sign of the strength of<br>our students and of our competitions<br>programs I'd like to acknowledge the<br>help and assistance given by many<br>practitioners judges and mediators in<br>judging and giving tips to our teams as<br>they prepare to go and compete<br>internationally the first team I'd like<br>to recognize is the Red Cross<br>asia-pacific international humanitarian<br>law MOOC team so this was a team that<br>firstly had to compete against all of<br>the other New Zealand law schools and<br>one are the humanitarian law mooting<br>competition in New Zealand and then we -<br>Hong Kong where that team competed<br>against 23 other teams from around the<br>asia-pacific region and going into at<br>the end of the preliminary round were<br>ranked 2nd of the 24 teams competing<br>they did extremely well they were ranked<br>as having had the best prosecution<br>memorial the memorial as the written<br>application and they also are the team<br>of one of the team members Hannah Reed I<br>was ranked as the best speaker in the<br>competition so we congratulate our<br>our representatives in that competition<br>really<br>tier two e bori liver and the coach of<br>the team truffle done with and sometimes<br>people say that routine is overly<br>dominated by men and it was great to see<br>this result was achieved by an all-woman<br>team we the next team that some took<br>parks was the our team that represented<br>Auckland in the Australia and New<br>Zealand air law boot competition and<br>aviation law has been a subject we've<br>developed recently at Auckland with the<br>support of Air New Zealand and it's been<br>absolutely superb to see how well some<br>of our students have done in air lore<br>MOOC competitions this year or last year<br>I should say they won our the Australia<br>New Zealand Air law competition beating<br>the University of Queensland in the<br>final so if we could congratulate again<br>as the main set of that team Hannah Reed<br>Kyle Simonson and the coaches Michael<br>Greenup and Nick Porter and the other<br>two are competitions we were represented<br>in recently and this was only I think<br>about a month and a half ago we sent a<br>team to the issue of a pre mullet<br>Fremont teams to mention but back in<br>February we sent a team to the<br>international commercial chamber the<br>International Chamber of Commerce's<br>international commercial mediation<br>competition and if there's an immense<br>event it involves hundreds of mediators<br>from around the world it involves 65<br>University teams from more than 30<br>countries and our team this year reached<br>the semi-finals they were ranked third<br>equal in the world and only just missed<br>advancing to the final can we<br>congratulate first Antonio Bradley if I<br>get a sensitive<br>cien brothers caroline coats and their<br>coach under leonard just a few weeks ago<br>we had the team returned from the philip<br>jessup international law boot<br>competition the competition is held in<br>washington DC each year and as regarded<br>as one of the most prestigious mooting<br>competitions in the world there were<br>around 630 competitors at the event in<br>washington and our team did impressively<br>well they they had taken part actually<br>in a pre-meeting competition and this<br>was held for a number of the teams that<br>were going to be in Washington they won<br>the European promote competition held in<br>Budapest at the Jessup competition in<br>Washington they were placed second for<br>the applicant memorial so that was out<br>of all the teams that took part they<br>were ranked second in the world for the<br>quality of the applicant memorials they<br>were ranked the best applicant team when<br>you combine the applicant memorials and<br>the speaker scores and one of the team<br>members Michael Greenup was ranked the<br>third best speaker in the world and<br>another of the team members who<br>unfortunately can't be here tonight<br>Andrew grant was ranked the best speaker<br>in the world at the Jessup competition<br>so quite extraordinary and outstanding<br>results if we congratulate all of the<br>team members firstly careful Michael<br>michael grin up tear nelson and the<br>coaches jack davies increases Chewbacca<br>and as you can see I think they has<br>really been superb results by our<br>mooting competitors we also sent a team<br>to the William Booth commercial<br>arbitration moot this is the largest<br>routing competition in the world it's<br>held annually in Vienna head around 350<br>teams competing this year the team<br>competed in a number of pre mooting<br>competitions and were first in the Paris<br>promoting competition and runners-up in<br>the Heidelberg competition I would like<br>to particularly thank Bank side chambers<br>for sponsoring our the team's<br>participation and the support that Sir<br>David Williams who's here present one of<br>our alumni who has been instrumental and<br>Bank side chambers support has given<br>could we congratulate on a carry<br>Michael small<br>and coach Tom Park Tom works in the law<br>firms idea say they haven't listened<br>escaped but again I think they had such<br>impressive results that we again<br>congratulate all of our international<br>competition<br>with the winners of the new entrant<br>prizes come to the left-hand side of the<br>stage the winners of the new entrant<br>prizes receive a $100 book token but<br>perhaps more importantly they are<br>recognized as among our very best school<br>leavers who've joined the Auckland Law<br>School there is a very competitive<br>Awards awarded our two students leaving<br>school from throughout the country and I<br>think that's worth noting that every<br>year we have up to about 1500 students<br>who are take part who are enrolled in<br>first year law but we only award 19 new<br>entrant prizes and we're awarding a<br>further nine new entrant scholarship so<br>as you can imagine to be one of the 19<br>singled out for one of these prizes<br>means that we have a high hopes of these<br>students going forward if we first<br>congratulate Nicholas Ellen Rosalie<br>Kittleson<br>tonight joy Natacha the creek Isabelle<br>Douglas I used to go Yanis Gonzalez each<br>I'm leo<br>Rebecca Lloyd<br>- born pipe our Chino and some honey<br>send cheater wealth Selena right husband<br>welcome<br>and with the winners of the new entrants<br>scholarships come forward and send to<br>the left of the stage the winners of the<br>next set of awards each receive a $1000<br>scholarship and these are students who<br>have had superb school results and again<br>as I mentioned given that we have up to<br>around 1,500 first-year law students<br>that then drops to 380 students at<br>second year law these really are<br>incredibly high achieving students if we<br>course can congratulate Noreen gakushin<br>and Isabella Graham da new key Karuna<br>sukira<br>gabriela pin Elif Stephen Rene Jing and<br>I think you can see that all about top<br>first-year students are given them the<br>gender makeup we would hope to see many<br>more woman judges in law partners<br>emerging as a result in the number of<br>years<br>before we start on the second half of<br>the program we always have a tradition<br>at these ceremonies of introducing<br>someone who's contributed a lot to the<br>law school one of our notable alumni to<br>say a few words about their experiences<br>that may inspire some of the students<br>today and I'm very pleased that we have<br>one of our most prominent alumni able to<br>do so today so an end such an end as a<br>graduate of the Auckland law school he<br>worked as a lawyer he was appointed a<br>district court judge he was the<br>Ombudsman of New Zealand for ten years<br>during which time he dealt with all<br>manner of complaints difficulties that<br>individual citizens experienced and how<br>they're treated by government<br>departments and then as you'll all be<br>aware became governor-general of this<br>country from 2006 to 2011 so an end<br>career has been one of dedicated and<br>committed public service we appointed<br>him a Distinguished Fellow of the<br>Auckland Law School and true to his<br>character of humility commitment and<br>service he's been someone who hasn't<br>just taken the title but has lived it<br>who every month comes and spends time at<br>the law school who will talk to some of<br>our classes about the role of law with<br>respect to government administration who<br>will take part in judging mooting<br>competitions helping mentor for our<br>equal justice project and in all sorts<br>of ways is a wonderful presence around<br>the Auckland law school I would ask you<br>Dean<br>Andrew Stockley thank you for your<br>generously expressed<br>welcome deputy Dean Susan Watson faculty<br>members present throughout the room<br>distinguished guests including judges of<br>many courts Law Society president newly<br>elected Joanna pigeon those who have<br>presented and who will present for<br>Awards this evening and importantly your<br>family members<br>ladies and gentlemen Georgia can our<br>Coto Couture my contribution this<br>evening in this narrow slot that the<br>Dean spoke of is in two parts the first<br>being the speech I spent some little<br>time preparing of an orthodox<br>contribution by a senior legal<br>personality saying things that are<br>expected on occasions such as this that<br>speech noted the importance of this time<br>closing off an important phase in your<br>legal education it acknowledged the<br>commitment of yourselves and your<br>families in seeing things through to<br>this point the speech asked that you of<br>course that continue to keep the contact<br>with your law school and the time ahead<br>and it drew attention to the power of<br>the network that you already have in<br>which we have seen on the stage<br>edge and the continuing availability of<br>that if you choose to draw down on it I<br>would then have spoken about the value<br>of the experiences at University and the<br>Law School in particular and and the<br>lawyer leaf skills one acquires to<br>comprehend and hopefully solve some of<br>the multi-layered issues that will<br>confront you in our increasingly complex<br>world I was into writing what used to be<br>called the peroration when I reflected<br>on an aspect of my current reading of<br>two books by a leading United States<br>medical personality and by his name<br>you'll see he's a person of Indian<br>origin like myself I to go one day who<br>has written being mortal and Vita and at<br>least one or two other titles that you<br>see in the better quality bookshops and<br>the challenge that he presented recently<br>to graduating medical students based on<br>the experience of his lifetime as a<br>surgeon teacher and consultant I thought<br>it might be better to frame the five<br>pieces of advice that he gave to the<br>medical students me tatis me tenders for<br>lawyers on their journey law students on<br>their journey and thus there is a second<br>part of my contribution this evening the<br>first item is ask an unscripted question<br>a doctor and a lawyer in my view should<br>never lose the ability to ask questions<br>and should never lose the Faculty of<br>being inquisitive being inquisitive and<br>continuing to ask questions can only<br>lead to trouble in very limited<br>circumstances like the senior New<br>Zealand counsel appearing in the Privy<br>Council in the late 1960s saying to one<br>of the Law Lords do you follow me milord<br>to which the answer came I follow your<br>argument if that is what you mean mr. X<br>the second item after ask an unscripted<br>question is don't complain as lawyers<br>and law students you have acquired<br>skills to identify flaws and mistakes<br>and ways in which these might be<br>resolved instead of complaining it seems<br>good advice to say to you to do<br>something about securing redress beyond<br>just complaining the third item is count<br>something<br>this being shorthand for law students<br>and lawyers and people of a legal<br>background to observe and record and in<br>the event of seeing things occur and<br>particularly if they recur then<br>considering what action may be<br>appropriate the fourth item of advice is<br>to write something you acquire skills as<br>students of the law and as lawyers in<br>writing and legal writing<br>the present time provides opportunities<br>for people of a legal background to<br>write formally in briefs and opinions in<br>correspondence and pleadings but also<br>and not unimportant ly in journals and<br>in blogs writing and documenting our<br>essential legal skills and they benefit<br>from continued polishing and improvement<br>and tonight is an appropriate<br>opportunity to underline that for<br>everyone present the first and final<br>thing is change the world in front of<br>all of you who are receiving these<br>awards this evening is one where you<br>will you will come to apply your skills<br>having received your award<br>there'll be an expectation and you'll<br>have the next step where you will apply<br>your skills in a number of ways<br>do not feel hidebound<br>by the choices that you may have made to<br>date may I say be willing to back<br>yourself and to make change resolutely<br>if that is warranted so those are the<br>things that I leave in the room with you<br>ask don't complain count write and<br>change in closing I would like to quote<br>two people first<br>the champion New Zealand motor racing<br>driver the late Bruce McLaren who once<br>said it would be a waste of life to do<br>nothing with one's ability for life is<br>measured in achievement not in years<br>alone and then lastly the late Steve<br>Jobs co-founder of Apple who died in<br>2011 after a lengthy illness and he once<br>said your time is limited so don't waste<br>it living someone else's life don't be<br>trapped by Dogma which is living the<br>results of other people's thinking don't<br>let the noise of others opinions drown<br>out your own inner voice and most<br>importantly have the courage to follow<br>your heart and intuition they that is<br>your heart and intuition somehow already<br>know what you truly want to become<br>everything else is secondary that seems<br>to me at least to be a suitable note on<br>which to end and to wish each of you<br>will see order Kia car thank you for<br>thank

the<br>postgraduate prizes and scholarships<br>please come to the stage the Oakland<br>Moore School has the largest LLM program<br>in New Zealand indeed we have as many<br>master of law students as all of the<br>other New Zealand law schools combined<br>so in some ways I think it's a little<br>bit of a pity apart from the fact it<br>will prolong the ceremony that we don't<br>have more postgraduate prizes and<br>scholarships so anyone who would like to<br>assist in this area you'll be very<br>welcome our postgraduate programme I<br>think is also known for the fact that<br>every year we bring in a range of<br>overseas scholars who come and<br>contribute and who teach on that program<br>so it's something that makes it we get a<br>lot of overseas students so as a result<br>also come and study on the programme the<br>first of the awards of the Ellen and<br>Virginia green prize in environmental<br>law that has been awarded to Kristen<br>Jones the Fowles Memorial Prize for the<br>top masters student and the gays vert<br>prize for Master of Laws Sirica Thani<br>and the mallanna swagger Memorial<br>Pacifica student scholarship<br>Patricia Phil Cox this one should be a<br>and with the winners of the Faculty of<br>Law a Dean's Academic Excellence Awards<br>come to the stage not these senior<br>scholars at this stage but the winners<br>of the academic excellence awards these<br>are awards that are given at the end of<br>the undergraduate degree and they are<br>awarded to the top 10% of the graduating<br>class so given that we graduate just<br>over 300 students a year are for the LLB<br>and the LLB honors degrees these<br>students have obviously done incredibly<br>well to be recognized as the top 10% of<br>what is already a very high achieving<br>cohort because there's mention to get<br>through even into second year law<br>there's an enormous number far more<br>students who don't get through into<br>second year law than do so the winners<br>of the Faculty of Law<br>Dean's Academic Excellence Awards if we<br>firstly congratulate Ameer and sorry<br>Harriet<br>Dion chilling guy<br>Tyrone Tabriz silwan Fraser just agree<br>well Victoria Henderson Natalie coat<br>Amelia Lam German<br>Rebecca Morris<br>Jonathan Morton regulations Okanagan<br>Kate's Kinlan Tracey Turner org after<br>will and Lewis Whitcomb Carl<br>and if the recipients of the senior<br>scholar awards could come forward at<br>this point these are students who have<br>one faculty of law of Dean's academic<br>excellence awards but in addition they<br>have also won senior scholar awards and<br>these are given across the university to<br>the very best students and all faculties<br>so in the case of law this means that we<br>were allocated seven senior scholarships<br>to award to our graduating class of just<br>over 300 so as you can imagine to me one<br>of the seven scholars are singled out<br>for one of these awards as an incredible<br>achievement and one that requires<br>consistent excellence across all<br>subjects if we could first congratulate<br>jack Davies<br>Dennis tell Samuel Johnston Abigail<br>Lawson and Maxwell Smith<br>and the final award of this evening is<br>given to the top law undergraduate who<br>wins the Auckland District Law Society's<br>prize which also means of course as a<br>winner of the Faculty of Law Dean's<br>academic excellence award and also a<br>senior scholar award would you<br>congratulate this year's top student<br>Lynda Sullivan<br>congratulations<br>again on behalf of all the faculty can I<br>congratulate all of the students here<br>because as I said at the outset the<br>leadership that they show for our<br>student societies and for working for<br>the community and well-being of students<br>in all sorts of different ways and all<br>sorts of clubs and societies for the<br>different communities that make up the<br>floor school for the way in which many<br>of our students have competed have taken<br>part in many hours of preparation in<br>many hours of practices for their<br>competitions and then have excelled so<br>incredibly well both within New Zealand<br>and across the world and if we've also<br>congratulated obviously those students<br>whose academic work and whose commitment<br>and perseverance and ability to<br>understand aspects of the law again as<br>reflected in the awards that they have<br>received and in the recognition that we<br>give to them tonight as our very best<br>students and as people who will go<br>forward I'm sure and will work in the<br>law but will bring with them hopefully<br>our what they've gained from this law<br>school the meanings of hard work of<br>application of working for all sectors<br>of the community and in the very best<br>way to live up to the traditions of this<br>law school and the achievements of its<br>alumni I'd like to thank all of our<br>alumni here tonight who support us<br>through these awards but also through<br>the mentoring through the practical<br>assistance by judging MOOCs competitions<br>by coming in and giving of their time<br>and energy and passion in so many<br>different ways and it's no it's no<br>coincidence that when you've seen that<br>many of the coaches of our teams are in<br>fact recent graduates who have benefited<br>from the programs that we've run but<br>have then come back have organized to<br>put in the hours<br>taking our teams forward but bringing in<br>many of the older alumni who have his<br>work commitments mean they can't put in<br>many of the females that can come back<br>in with their experience and their<br>expertise to offer assistance at that<br>level so thank you all for the<br>contributions you make and as I said at<br>the start none of this would be possible<br>without the family support the support<br>of close friends that has nurtured and<br>supported our students every step of the<br>way I think they're still<br>that of wine or juice something to drink<br>and eat you will have the opportunity if<br>you want to photograph just with your<br>family with a prize-winner or one of the<br>teams if you want to photograph together<br>and do get hold of the photographer but<br>otherwise thank you very much for your<br>support of this law school and have a<br>good evening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
