with a perm<br>Ottawa Row rocket oedema tena koe tu<br>tena koe tu tena tato katoa my name is<br>Harlan hain and it is my great pleasure<br>to welcome you to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture for professor pat<br>langhorne now we are here in this room<br>but we also need to make a shout out to<br>an adjacent classroom because this IPL<br>has actually sold out and in fact I<br>haven't seen this many people in this<br>many lecture theatres since Jane Goodall<br>was here Pat so clearly you're a big<br>draw card when I look out on the<br>audience<br>today I see members of the academic<br>staff I see members of the professional<br>staff at Otago I see heads of<br>residential colleges and students and I<br>would like to warmly welcome each and<br>every one of you I would also like to<br>welcome members of the general public<br>who I know use these IPL's as part of<br>their lifelong learning because they<br>know that coming here gives them an<br>opportunity to have a quick peek into<br>some of the outstanding research that is<br>happening here at the University of<br>Otago but I have a couple of other<br>special welcomes this evening I'd like<br>to give a special welcome to Professor<br>Vernon Squire who is wearing a couple of<br>hats tonight he's obviously here as a<br>DBC academic but most importantly<br>perhaps at this particular IPL he is<br>here as the proud husband of our speaker<br>I would also like to warmly welcome<br>Pat's nephew Tom Langhorne and he's here<br>from Balmore in Scotland and his friend<br>Amandine who is here from France and<br>it's fantastic to have both of you here<br>and I would also like to warmly welcome<br>Wolfgang and Ursula RAC who have driven<br>here from Christchurch for Pat's IPL and<br>I know that your presence here is<br>incredibly special to her so thank you<br>very much for coming in general everyone<br>who is here should feel very warmly<br>welcomed it's a fantastic occasion and<br>we're glad that you could all join us so<br>we're all here to celebrate Pat Lang<br>horns promotion to Professor now our<br>benchmark for promotion professor here<br>at the university of<br>is extremely high and in addition to<br>applying our own rigorous standards we<br>also seek the views of internationally<br>recognized experts in the candidates<br>area of research so when we thought this<br>kind of feedback about Pat's case for<br>promotions one referee told us Pat<br>Langhorne has an outstanding reputation<br>in the international research community<br>as a leading scientist with great<br>integrity and enthusiasm for Antarctic<br>sea ice her work is innovative and has<br>tackled some particularly challenging<br>scientific questions another referee<br>told us the substance and rigor of dr.<br>lang horns publication are a hallmark of<br>her career and yet another said dr. lang<br>horn is a major scholar and contributor<br>to the scientific body of knowledge at<br>an international level<br>she has mentored and guided a cohort of<br>outstanding scientists to carry the<br>torch in her role as a faculty member at<br>the University of Otago what they all<br>told us was that this promotion was long<br>overdue and I could not agree more so on<br>a personal note I have known Pat for a<br>very long time in fact she and Vernon<br>were two of the very first people that<br>Michael and I met when we came to the<br>University of Otago more than 25 years<br>ago so I can personally attest to past<br>commitment to Otago to her research and<br>to her students and to this day as a<br>full professor she is often teaching an<br>undergraduate physics laboratory until<br>7:00 p.m. so professor Langhorne on<br>behalf of the University of Otago I<br>would like to congratulate you on your<br>very well-deserved promotion to<br>Professor and I will now call on<br>Professor Richard Barker who is the pro<br>vice-chancellor of Sciences to tell us<br>just a little bit more about your<br>academic journey at Otago thank<br>tonight coin professor Langhorne tena<br>koutou tena koutou tena tato yati it is<br>my pleasure to welcome you all this<br>evening to the inaugural professorial<br>lecture for professor pat langhorne<br>professor langhorne was born in Glasgow<br>you know my only reference for a<br>Glaswegian language accent as Billy<br>Connolly and fortunately well Pat<br>doesn't really sound like Billy Connolly<br>which i think is a good thing she<br>doesn't speak like Billy Connolly which<br>I know is a good thing professor<br>Langhorne has been interested in polar<br>region since her teenage year and so it<br>was natural that after taking an<br>undergraduate physics degree at the<br>University of Aberdeen she completed her<br>PhD on sea ice at the Scott Polar<br>Research Institute in Cambridge England<br>during this time professor Langhorne was<br>mentored by Bill Robertson Robinson from<br>the DSi are in New Zealand and he was on<br>a period of research Lee and he's<br>perhaps best known for his invention of<br>the lead rubber bearing now Pat doesn't<br>study led rubber bearings significantly<br>he also started a research program at<br>the DSi are on Antarctic sea ice after<br>completing her PhD professor Langhorne<br>mysteriously changed research area and<br>ran a jet engine combustion instability<br>experiment and what is nowaday m-- or<br>what so in the research lab for who is<br>now a man darlings<br>group at the in the Department of<br>Engineering in Cambridge we suspect this<br>had something to do with the gentleman a<br>couple of places along professor Lang<br>hall and eventually became the<br>rolls-royce research fellow in<br>engineering at Union College and worked<br>on jet engine combustion and stabilities<br>for five years during this time<br>professor langhorne and professor Squire<br>were invited to take part in the New<br>Zealand Antarctic program on an<br>experiment in McMurdo Sound with bill<br>Robinson thus free sparking and in<br>and polar regions in 1988 Professor<br>Langhorne arrived at the University of<br>Otago and I'm going to use her words<br>here heavily pregnant with first son<br>John Oh professor Langhorne is forever<br>grateful to the late professor Jack Dodd<br>who offered her some teaching upon her<br>arrival and when she told him she was<br>pregnant he said after a short<br>hesitation that's no problem<br>for which I'm sure John Oh is also<br>forever grateful proximity to Antarctica<br>has provided Professor Langhorne was<br>many opportunities to visit Scott Base<br>New Zealand's Antarctic base and McMurdo<br>Sound on the Ross Sea and she's also<br>been able to work at Australian Davis<br>station in East Antarctica traveling on<br>the Australian icebreaker Aurora<br>Australis this evening we're going to<br>hear about how natural ice around the<br>globe responds to climate change at<br>different rates depending on the<br>location and the type of ice professor<br>Lang horn will describe her efforts to<br>reconcile observations with models of<br>sea ice close to an ice shelf in the<br>framework of what is happening in the<br>Southern Ocean please welcome professor<br>Pat Langhorne<br>thank you<br>can you hear me is it all right<br>microphone tena koutou tena koutou tena<br>koutou katoa cool part Langhorne talk o<br>allah sorry in 1976 I left the<br>University of Aberdeen that you've just<br>heard proudly collecting my honors<br>certificate in civics and intent on<br>pursuing a dream to measure Antarctic<br>things I applied to British Antarctic<br>Survey and I applied of course as part<br>Longhorn they were interested they were<br>interested in Pat Langhorne provided<br>provided it with Patrick Langhorne and<br>not Patricia blank on so I received a<br>letter that said sorry but we don't<br>employ women so that brought us on our<br>journey that has brought us here so I<br>enrolled in a PhD at the Scott Polar<br>Research Institute and studied CA now I<br>need to see a little bit about sea ice<br>to start here sea ice grows every year<br>around Antarctica which is my particular<br>interest<br>it starts from almost nothing and growth<br>to 14 million square kilometers by the<br>middle of the year in fact if you were<br>to look down from space what you would<br>see would be originally in the summer<br>that would just be the whiteness about<br>the Antarctic land that doubles when the<br>sea ice grows by the middle of winter so<br>it doubles the area of lightness the<br>Antarctic and the Arctic you can see are<br>quite different the Antarctic is land<br>surrounded by ocean making the ocean<br>very dynamic<br>and famously uncomfortable to be a pond<br>and the Arctic on the other hand is a<br>sea surrounded by land so what does sea<br>ice here is a photograph of some fresh<br>newly formed ice froze the night before<br>besides some thicker ice sea ice is<br>frozen ocean it's salty and all of that<br>salt is contained in pockets within the<br>ice so the ice isn't solid in fact it<br>doesn't get solid til line that's 50 its<br>surrounded by ice thank you when it's<br>because this is what it looks like so<br>the ocean freezes during winter and when<br>it does that it's losing heat upwards to<br>the atmosphere it rejects cold and salty<br>water downward and back into the ocean<br>and we've already heard it makes the<br>ocean look white and that whiteness<br>reflects energy back up to the<br>atmosphere and it prevents that heat<br>energy from entering the ocean so it's a<br>very important factor in keeping the<br>ocean cool it acts as a barrier it<br>prevents heat and moisture exchange<br>between the ocean and the atmosphere so<br>the Arctic which has visited for my PhD<br>turn out is very different now than it<br>was when I was there in 1979 here we've<br>got two pictures of summer sea ice<br>extent in the Arctic 1979 on the left<br>and 2016 on the right<br>you only need to glance at these to see<br>that things have changed dramatically in<br>fact 50% or more of Arctic sea ice mass<br>so as you've heard music as impaired I<br>did my PhD and then I decided to conduct<br>the first social experiment I have done<br>sort of the last one I should say my<br>hypothesis was this that one could be<br>interested in anything provided you knew<br>enough about it and so when I was<br>offered the job as a postdoc in jet<br>combustion instability I said sure<br>I'm fine tell me what it's about now do<br>that I had a very exciting time I<br>learned a huge amount and eventually it<br>became very terrifying I have to see see<br>it was kind of a scary experiment but it<br>was in the end a field experiment<br>because I would sneak off work on Friday<br>afternoons back from Scott Polar<br>Research Institute to look up the<br>journals to see what had been going on<br>in sea ice during that time while I was<br>working as a jet engineer we got Vernon<br>and I got an invitation from this<br>character here and he was a character<br>bill Robinson he'd be my mentor as we've<br>just heard throughout my PhD the<br>experiment was to look at moving loads<br>on sea ice so when a heavy object goes<br>over sea ice it makes waves from the ice<br>so if you are thinking of flying over a<br>ship and looking down on the ocean you<br>would see waves coming out from the ship<br>same thing happens if you drive a<br>vehicle very fast over sea ice are in<br>fact very slowly over sea ice - here's<br>the vehicle<br>it's a u.s. Dodge truck<br>it was salvaged from the ca'se in the<br>days when there was no environmental<br>regulations and so what happened was<br>that when the u.s. wanted to get rid of<br>their grungy old vehicles they just<br>drove them out on the sea ice we're told<br>summer being vehicle disappeared all<br>tidied up but what happened here is the<br>Kiwis went out on the CA and toured the<br>truck back did it up and we were<br>assigned it for our experiments so bill<br>being the brave ones drove the vehicle<br>along the ice road here it says here you<br>can see the ice road there and while<br>that was being driven measurements were<br>made with these devices to measure the<br>waves that were generated by these by<br>the vehicle going pass original Ice Road<br>Truckers really to get our data points<br>so we needed to go up faster and faster<br>speeds and above about 60 kilometers an<br>hour on an ice road things get wobbly<br>and you're driving near the instruments<br>and tents with people in it gets a bit<br>heated so bills enlisted our American<br>trains again he said how would you like<br>to lend us a c-130 with a pilot please a<br>c-130 Hercules aircraft could come along<br>our route and that they did I was given<br>the job and it is the most exciting<br>moment of my life can't even talk about<br>it<br>no whoo 40 years later and with the most<br>exciting moment of my life to talk on<br>the radio of the pilot of this aircraft<br>to gave him along the road<br>this turned out to be a very successful<br>experiment we got the front cover of<br>nature and I went back to jet<br>engineering however we'd seen New<br>Zealand and we like New Zealand in<br>Cambridge you have to ask permission to<br>walk on the grass in New Zealand the<br>last minute right it was the funniest<br>joke in the world when I said can a walk<br>on the grass so as we've heard 1988<br>Vernon and I came here and for the next<br>30 years under the leadership of Tim<br>Haskell here shown in his absolute<br>element his happiest place and he led<br>the New Zealand ca's program initially<br>Tim and I worked on we've induced<br>breakup of CAS and collaboration with<br>Vernon and all vermin people they did<br>the clever modelling Tim and I did the<br>experiment so early in here was to think<br>about what happens when ocean waves come<br>in to see a snow bit different so ocean<br>waves comenta sea ice Deven that to and<br>fro and to and fro and to and fro and<br>eventually a break and the photograph<br>here shows ice being broken into flowed<br>by waves coming in from the ocean from<br>that direction so Gemini's the<br>mechanical property set so this was some<br>heavy engineering again so we cut<br>through the 2 meter sea ice cover with a<br>ditch-digger and cut out large samples<br>with this ditch-digger on the left-hand<br>side here<br>Tim standing proudly beside a large<br>lock of CA that's one meter by one meter<br>by 2 meter slick so that less then<br>lifted out with a cream and on the<br>right-hand side is one of our bins so a<br>sort of arm of sea ice it's 10 meters<br>long by 1 meter wide by 10 meters long<br>and then at one end using terms<br>engineering skills it's loaded up and<br>down pretending to be an ocean wave and<br>we measured how long it took for that<br>ice to breach it would solve destroying<br>work I have to say because sometimes it<br>took a long time sometimes it didn't<br>break at all and all that time as you<br>can imagine we're in Antarctica in<br>winter so these gaps freeze up so people<br>had to go around all the time clearing<br>out all the slush truck at one point Tim<br>said that data point we've got costs<br>$100,000 luckily we got more no mine of<br>my job on this project was to look at<br>the ice structure to look at what how<br>much liquid the war is in the 8th to<br>look at the crystallographic structure<br>and what I saw was completely different<br>to what I'd seen in the Arctic when we<br>lifted a block up as we see here we saw<br>big plates of a sticky note big as my<br>hand and it's called platelet ice for<br>obvious reasons so we got intrigued by<br>was it there the water there is cooled<br>how cool is it why do we only see it at<br>the bottom of the sea ice cover not at<br>the top<br>what's it got to do with the ice shelf<br>nearby we got fascinated and in the late<br>1990s Inger Smith began her PhD to look<br>at some of these questions and what she<br>showed was that indeed if the water was<br>cold and I mean<br>very very very cold so-called that it<br>below the temperature at which<br>temperature three called supercooled<br>water if it was very cool then we got<br>plate like if it was only a wee bit<br>called<br>such that it was at freezing point of -<br>- then you got ordinary bog-standard<br>isolate you would see in the Arctic we<br>also wanted to answer the question why<br>do we only see at the bottom of the sea<br>a not a problem there because that bit<br>froze in the middle of winter and we<br>wanted not only to know about the ice<br>but we also want to know about the ocean<br>underneath so remain goes works we<br>evolved to running to winter over<br>projects now what I mean by winter over<br>project is that a team of scientists a<br>field assistant a postdoc and the PhD<br>student spent eight to nine months on<br>the CA making measurements of the ice<br>and the ocean at the same time and we<br>did that twice I didn't do it great up<br>there did so there's a serious<br>commitment and doing this remember<br>they're out there on the sea ice<br>temperatures minus 40 winds blowing and<br>it's dark it's a challenging challenging<br>environment and the data these guys got<br>has taught us an awful lot about what's<br>going on and it turns out that the ice<br>shelf is a big big clear in all of this<br>so what's an ice shelf<br>I said see Asus throws an ocean an ice<br>shelf is ice that had come from the land<br>so this is a map of Antarctica only made<br>by Craig Leonard and the blue<br>you park a ratio so about 40 well almost<br>50% of the course Lane Ivanka of the<br>coastline of Antarctica is a shil<br>so it means that on 50% of the coastline<br>the sea ice is freezing not to the cost<br>but to the ice shelf and the cool thing<br>is here is the site that we go to this<br>is McMurdo zone but tells me a few times<br>and that is just to remind me to see<br>we're very lucky to go there because<br>people have been going there for a long<br>time since before World War one in fact<br>alone okay so what is an ice shelf and a<br>shelf is not at all salty it's a fresh<br>water it's a mass of glass here it's the<br>ice that has formed on the Antarctic<br>continent that has slowed down onto the<br>sea and it's floating easier I shells<br>are hundreds to thousands of meters<br>thick so again quite different to the<br>thickness of sea ice which is 2 meters<br>so what have we found out about see a<br>social interaction no this is my reality<br>check these are some of the people some<br>of the people who have been involved in<br>this journey with me it really must be a<br>team effort and as you look through<br>these names you'll see there are people<br>from a toggle there are people from<br>Canterbury University there are people<br>from Mira and these are the principal<br>groups that I've worked with but there<br>are also international collaborators and<br>some of the people I've put up there<br>have got one institution beside them<br>when they might have been students and<br>then so they're really another<br>institution though so this is these are<br>some of the people that I need to<br>acknowledge in the work that we're<br>talking about here so let's look at ice<br>shelves and sea ice if you're flying<br>down to Antarctica and you look out the<br>window as you approach the continent<br>this is what you see out the window up<br>on the right here of a satellite image<br>to try and sort of help put it in<br>perspective because what you can see is<br>there's a lot of white and some glue<br>right very hard to tell where the<br>coastline is you'll just need to take my<br>word for it it's there where the<br>mountains are Mountains usually indicate<br>land<br>so there we can see the coastline this<br>is the coastline here this is a big lump<br>of ice called the drag of the ice tongue<br>so this is a big lump of ice it's<br>floating in the ocean but it's come from<br>the land and then here we have sea ice<br>and the front of the picture and I've<br>chosen this picture because it also has<br>some open ocean here now that might be<br>is like art warm it's melting nothing so<br>pleasant there's open ocean here because<br>of the blooming great holing Gil that's<br>blowing down off the land so this is a<br>region we call Apple India means open<br>water where there shouldn't be open<br>water it should be frozen so the point<br>here is that the ice from the land<br>interacts with sea ice it interacts with<br>the atmosphere OTAs interacts with the<br>atmosphere it interacts with the ocean<br>and it does so above and below the 8th<br>so let's take a little journey down<br>below sea ice let's take the plunge<br>like part one pan might I PhD student<br>per type EHD student is doing here this<br>was in devastation in November in 2050<br>so this is a hole in the sea ice and<br>he's going through a we dip so what<br>would you see if you go down underneath<br>the sea ice and I should see if you go<br>down underneath sea ice near an ice<br>shelf now this is quite a busy plot but<br>I want to take you through it<br>on the left-hand side here we've got an<br>ice shelf right it's hundreds to<br>thousands of meters thick so it's thick<br>not to skill this picture here we have<br>CF it's one to two meters things the CAS<br>is freezing and it's doing that by<br>CAS is growing so as it grows it rejects<br>called salty water is heavy so it falls<br>down that's what these little blue<br>arrows that can has Kate liberal and<br>sure it goes down and into the ocean and<br>this part here is our ocean and this is<br>the landmass the seabed now s this<br>called salty water finds its way to the<br>bottom of the ice shelf which remember<br>might be hundreds of thousands of feet<br>thirty meters deep then what can happen<br>they should get melted deep down in the<br>ice shelf that means her what it becomes<br>less salty so it rises up underneath the<br>ice shell and when it does that it can<br>be moved so that it is more cold than<br>its freezing point<br>colder than it's freezing point we call<br>that super cooled<br>this cane of water often has ice<br>crystals in it and they appear to come<br>sporadically we don't really understand<br>why and these ice crystals then float up<br>under the ice shelf and under the sea<br>ice an undersea earth we call it<br>platelet ice and that's what I want to<br>spend most of the rest of the lecture<br>talking boat so here we are here we are<br>under the water with a diver<br>now this diver poses Iko and I had an<br>argument he had an argument he said that<br>these ice crystals appeared because the<br>divers upset them and they made them<br>float up I said no no no no the work<br>that Gregg and Indian people have done<br>says that these crystals come<br>sporadically and episodically for some<br>reason don't know why and this little<br>video clip he sent me when he conceded<br>that I was right that from time to time<br>these underwater snowstorms do happen<br>they just come so I'll show you it<br>please please try and ignore the<br>distracting biology here what you're<br>really interested in are these tiny<br>little glimpse of light these are ice<br>crystal in the water column and up at<br>the top surface here you can see the<br>bottom of the sea ice and how these<br>crystals have sort of come up in sort of<br>these tiny crystals float up under the<br>sea ice and then they sit there and it<br>turns out that the water that is just<br>below the surface is most below its<br>super it's freezing point<br>so the coldest water is near the surface<br>so the crystals sit there and they can<br>become very big on the left-hand side<br>here is naturally looking very very<br>happy because she's found a very big one<br>there's another consequence as well when<br>you put instruments in the water you<br>have to tie them on with a rope or at<br>least the funders prefer if you do it's<br>tied them on with a rope or some routing<br>line put it down in the hole in the sea<br>ice and then when you pull your<br>murdering line back up this is what you<br>get the meringue lines all covered in<br>ice crystals and this can happen right<br>down for 30 meters from the talk of the<br>ocean you get these ice crystals for me<br>and this is an instrument that wasn't<br>doing its job very well not surprisingly<br>this is a current meter so these<br>crystals form and everything they move<br>instruments around they can make big<br>they also accumulate under sea ice and<br>this is a photograph of the ice water<br>interface of sea ice where they're<br>collected in a loose friable layer<br>that's fragile it's when you try and<br>take a sample of the sea ice these<br>crystals are just like a slushy there's<br>I don't know if you've had a slushy but<br>you know one of these mushy drink things<br>that what it's like and that's loose<br>friable layer that we call the sub ice<br>platelet layer<br>be very sick to be seven meters thick<br>like to the roof under 2 meters of sea<br>ice so there's a lot of this ice around<br>sometimes and this list fragile layer<br>gets frozen into the CAS eventually so<br>this these are two crystallographic<br>samples of CAS on the left-hand side the<br>thing I want you to notice is that the<br>crystals which are the things that have<br>a single color are extending all the way<br>from the top to the bottom of the 10<br>centimeter long sample right clearly ice<br>on the other hand Sol higgledy-piggledy<br>big mess necks very pretty<br>photograph actually but it's a big mess<br>of crystals so each of these crystals is<br>just a small little hand cheek thing<br>that has got em frozen into the CAS and<br>there is no regular structure no the<br>columnar race the kind of a SH you see<br>in the Arctic tells us there has been no<br>a shelf and influence the water is not<br>been very cold this one tells us that<br>sea ice has grown in this supercooled<br>water that's very very very cold water<br>this is great because now if we know how<br>to interpret it we can go in the<br>springtime when you know it's sunny and<br>the temperatures are warmer and there's<br>nice food and all that stuff and just<br>examples of sea ice and if we know how<br>to interpret it we can ask the ca's did<br>you grow in super cold water or not and<br>it can tell us if we know how to<br>so I wanted to see a few word about why<br>we should care and to be honest with you<br>we started this work when there was<br>really no reason why anybody should care<br>about platelet ace but we have kind of<br>sort of some reasons now so why should<br>we care about this very cold a show of<br>water and clearly ice first of all see a<br>sickness let's look at sea ice thickness<br>and how that's affected turns out that<br>sea ice is thicker next in Asia than it<br>would be if the a ship wasn't there and<br>the kind of measurements we have is your<br>10 Kia where it's about 25 centimeters<br>thicker for a 2 meter thick ice sheet<br>than it would be if the ice ship wasn't<br>here it might also have an effect on sea<br>ice extent the area that you see of CAS<br>if you look down from space but I'll<br>secondly platelet ice if you're an algae<br>is a lovely place to live<br>I'll give love plate the ice it's a very<br>highly productive biological habitat and<br>because the these are gear at the bottom<br>of the food chain losing them would be a<br>very sad thing but the third reason is<br>the one that has intrigued us the most<br>that is can we use the knowledge that we<br>have of sea ice growing under the<br>influence of a nation can we use that to<br>see something about what's happening in<br>these<br>your cavities or at least in the Asia of<br>cavity and over sir machine so the these<br>ocean cavities these spaces between<br>underneath ice shelves are some of the<br>least accessible parts of the planet and<br>people are working out what's happening<br>down there by looking at satellite<br>images by measuring how far these ice<br>shelves are from our Father floating<br>above the surface and there's also some<br>very expensive operations to send remote<br>vehicles underneath a shelf so these are<br>very inaccessible places but of course<br>satellites have only been up for less<br>time than I've been alive and that's of<br>course nothing and we know that people<br>have been going to this site for over a<br>hundred years and so we have a way of<br>looking at some of the data that these<br>guys have brought back and comparing it<br>to what we see now so this is a map of<br>McMurdo Sound this is Ross Island where<br>Scott Base is located on the tip here<br>and Scott this is very close to the<br>Montmartre ice shelf so this is a place<br>where very cold water flows out from<br>under the ice shelf and the more green<br>it is the colder or more voluminous this<br>ice shelf water is so the question we're<br>asking is can we use the sea ice<br>measurements to see if this outflow of<br>cold water has changed over the last 100<br>years because that lets us extend<br>satellite measurements backwards and<br>there's only enough measurements for us<br>to do look at two places actually so<br>let's look and see what they see one of<br>the great heroes of my life is this chap<br>here it wouldn't<br>he made measurements all the way through<br>the winter of 1911 and 1912 he did so in<br>the comfort of a wall of snow and he did<br>it with a mercury-in-glass thermometer<br>and he made these measurements to a<br>precision of a hundredth of a degree C<br>to their extraordinary measurement so<br>what's shown here is the temperature of<br>the upper part of the ocean here's<br>Nelson with his hole through the ice<br>into the ocean so this is the<br>temperature of the upper part of the<br>ocean and this is the season so plotted<br>different years of data as different<br>colors and the cane of urine sort of<br>colors there are Nelson's measurements<br>so the yellowy ones are Nelson's<br>measurements they're from 1911 and then<br>on top of that which you can't see so<br>well because we would de-emphasized them<br>and the way we've plotted them are the<br>more recent measurements the thing to<br>notice is that there aren't any<br>differences between what Nelson measured<br>but there's only a few measurements<br>there right not a huge range so we also<br>looked at the sea ice no this is a<br>seriously busy plot so let me try and<br>take you through this on these axes is<br>some kind of thickness<br>nevermind what right along here we have<br>time and that time goes from 1902 to the<br>present and there's some little<br>squiggles in that time so it's not a<br>linear plot and there are three<br>different types of data on here the pink<br>and the blue are where crystals were<br>measured so they're taken<br>this is evidence of platelet ice from<br>taking and looking at the crystals and<br>the sea ice once it's solid the green<br>lines are from the sub-base platelet<br>layer this mushy layer or else from<br>measurements of ice on route no so<br>here's a reminder of the three things<br>that are being measured there somebody's<br>platelet layer that mushy layer ice on<br>rocks these current grades or crystals<br>and these are pink and blue can you see<br>the trend can you see any trained in<br>these data I can we couldn't we<br>obviously need to bring some more<br>statistics in to make it tub what we<br>concluded is that the answer to the<br>question has McMurdo Sound platelet I<br>changed from 1902 to present is no it<br>hasn't<br>now this is not something<br>it's a reassurance for that little part<br>of Antarctica but it is certainly not<br>the message for all of Antarctica<br>because we have to also think does the<br>interaction between ice shelves and sea<br>ice matter on an Antarctic wage scale<br>and that leads us to look at what is<br>actually happening with Antarctic sea<br>ice we've seen that in the Arctic the<br>sea ASIS declaiming bad news bad news<br>for polar bears<br>things are very dire in the Arctic the<br>Antarctic on the other hand is doing<br>surprising things the ocean has absorbed<br>over 90 percent of the energy that's<br>been building up because of global<br>warming but yet Antarctic sea ice has<br>changed very little so I've chosen the<br>two samples I chose before September 79<br>and September 2006 in again I think a<br>glance at these you don't see any<br>difference between them right to see a<br>difference what you have to do is go to<br>some more work you have to plot time and<br>this is only from satellite measurements<br>no so the time series begins in 1979 and<br>this is a plot of the percentage<br>increase in sea ice area and it's small<br>you can see it's not only just over the<br>error in the measurement it's also very<br>variable so in some places Antarctic sea<br>ice is declining rapidly and in other<br>places it's expanding so this is only<br>the overall picture this makes it hard<br>for the nervous system model note and<br>our system model is a computer program<br>with millions of lines of code that<br>simulate what's happening all the plane<br>that things that are happening in the<br>atmosphere in the ocean and in the ice<br>and puts them all together and because<br>the ocean is warming and the atmosphere<br>is warming air system models are going<br>to predict that Antarctic sea ice is<br>decreasing could ice shelf ca'se<br>interaction play a role and the some of<br>the things we don't understand so what<br>we've done here is to plot all the<br>places were<br>we know that I shall CIA's interaction<br>is taking place so the bigger the green<br>blog the more interaction and what<br>you'll see from this plot is that there<br>really isn't very many places where<br>there is a shelf and ocean interaction<br>taking place so we do need to go to an F<br>system model and this is one that's been<br>run by Andrew poling or a master student<br>supervised by Inga Smith it's a silly a<br>bit and here's what this F system model<br>with one and a half million lines of<br>computer code predicts these are the<br>satellite images for sea ice around<br>Antarctica and February in September<br>this is what the model predicts on a<br>standard run right you can see it's not<br>perfect but at least it lays ice in the<br>summer so what Andrea is done is asked<br>the question if I pretend to be an ice<br>shelf and push a whole lot of very cold<br>fresh water near the ocean surface in<br>the model how much do I have to put out<br>to reverse the trend that the models<br>give so you should just see what this is<br>this is sea ice area against time again<br>here are runs without fresh water in the<br>model and these are runs with fresh<br>water water in the model hooray<br>it goes up maybe this is the missing<br>physics<br>the only problem is this is probably an<br>so let me just recap and I'll say a<br>couple of words about the future for us<br>the things that are we're all fired up<br>about now and then you can go and have<br>some weed we have had see no detectable<br>change in temperature or volume of the<br>surface a show of water outflow from<br>beneath the McMurdo ice shelf over the<br>past 100 years the Ross Ice Shelf is a<br>call base a shelf and so that is a huge<br>relief but it's not grounds for<br>completely second point is that using<br>platelet-rich an Antarctic ways mark<br>shows very cold surface ice shell water<br>where we're going to go from here the<br>question that we're asking now is how<br>pervasive is the effect of this a show<br>of water we have been rather limited to<br>the local region around scope B's which<br>is down here we know I shelves influency<br>a sickness we wanna know how far it goes<br>how far does this influence extend no I<br>left the most embarrassing admission<br>rate to the end our knowledge of CAS<br>sickness is pitifully poor we really<br>don't know much about the distribution<br>of sea ice thickness around Antarctica<br>and that's largely because there haven't<br>been submarines<br>in Antarctica so it's a good reason but<br>the result is not that we don't know<br>much about thickness so we want to<br>measure thickness around Antarctica or<br>what we want to mix or<br>nor that too ambitious we want to<br>measure see a sickness in our area of<br>Antarctica and the way you can do that<br>is with one of these but this weight<br>beam thing here belonging to Wolfgang<br>right from them this is the University<br>of Canterbury s1 this is an<br>electromagnetic induction device we can<br>mount it on a sled and then drive around<br>on the sea ice towing it behind driver<br>skidooed and it measures for us<br>snow and ice thickness and as a bonus<br>the sub-base platelet layer so the mushy<br>layer underneath that's great but even<br>on a scooter you can't actually get that<br>far so let's put it under a helicopter<br>and we lovingly call it the en Verte<br>when it's life so we'll put the e/m vert<br>under the helicopter and fly it around<br>on the sea ice here's how this works<br>here's the en bird here it measures the<br>height above the snow with a laser and<br>then it measures the height above the<br>ocean surface electromagnetically that's<br>great but that doesn't let us get beyond<br>the landfire CA so last year and McMurdo<br>Sound we toured this device and I should<br>have said it has to be 20 to 50 meters<br>above the sea ice surface has to fly low<br>this last year in 2016 we did a pilot<br>study with this beautiful 1943 dc-3<br>which is the only aircraft certified in<br>the world to tow this embers<br>so what we would really like to do is to<br>fly this gadget around the Ross Sea at<br>the very minute at this very minute a<br>collaboration of ours<br>well aus-8 breaker is in the Ross Sea<br>they're making measurements a few of our<br>team are on that cruise and we would<br>like to do a survey of that area to<br>so let me conclude by just thanking some<br>more some of our major funders<br>throughout this time we've had support<br>from Antarctica New Zealand then the<br>logistic support cannot be<br>underestimated it's absolutely critical<br>that being given by Antarctica New<br>Zealand the work we want to do this year<br>as part of the Deep South national<br>science challenge we've been funded<br>throughout by the universities of Otago<br>Canterbury and also Antarctica New<br>Zealand scholarships<br>plus other money and marsden and forced<br>have also supplied money on this<br>beautiful photograph this is MIDI long<br>exposure short here's a man walking to a<br>vehicle with a head torch on and getting<br>in so this is a mid D in mid July in<br>2009 and here are some of the midea does<br>the team that have done this work and<br>some of them you have heard about<br>already some of them not and a special<br>thanks for helping me find my way<br>through the Martinez to the late bill<br>Robinson and we've heard about already<br>Tim Haskell to my very collegial<br>colleagues in the department of physics<br>and particularly the support from Rob<br>Ola and Derek Allen<br>and to my family I think it I would not<br>have got past the first step is Vernon<br>Hardin in there nagging me throughout<br>the time thank you<br>let's Justice are about to say let's<br>just assume this is working but I think<br>it's now working<br>my name is Craig Roger and I am the<br>current heat of the physics department<br>it is my honor and pleasure to thank Pat<br>for her lecture today Pat has talked to<br>us about her research passion<br>understanding policy ice with human<br>driven climate changes that come more<br>and more important for us to understand<br>our icy poles and the multiple<br>interactions they have with the global<br>climate system<br>Patterson reminded us of one of the<br>mysteries of the poles that arctic ice<br>is retreating rapidly that Antarctic sea<br>ice is changing little indeed it might<br>even be increasing with time and Pat has<br>described to us today over her long and<br>successful career she's been working on<br>problems around Antarctic sea ice<br>throughout and has created real<br>increases in our understanding<br>throughout her talk she has described<br>her many collaborators and students for<br>Pat is a generous person who always<br>shares credit from her presentation you<br>can see how was collegial and<br>collaborative attitude has served her so<br>well an Antarctic research this is a<br>classic example where the resources<br>brought by many different institutions<br>often from many countries lead the more<br>successful research than could be<br>undertaken by a group operating in<br>isolation in her long career at Otago<br>Pat has constantly demonstrated her<br>collegial attitude never one to brag or<br>blow her own trumpet the Department of<br>Physics is extremely proud of her<br>especially at this moment where we can<br>celebrate the promotion to professor we<br>are also grateful to Pat she has taken<br>on many core service roles in the<br>department including being our immediate<br>previous head of department for a four<br>year period on a personal level I am<br>grateful to paddling<br>in 2007 I wanted to set up an experiment<br>in Antarctica and so I turned to Pat for<br>advice as to what to do both in terms of<br>negotiating the politics of Antarctica<br>New Zealand and also what the hell to do<br>in terms of a basic I would like to put<br>a thing down on Antarctica a place I<br>have never been and I really don't know<br>what to do this was successful I must<br>add it there it works so thank you bet<br>years before that Pat lectured me<br>throughout my undergraduate career which<br>was obviously successful from my point<br>of view one of the things I particularly<br>remember about Pat is in those<br>undergraduate lectures where we asked<br>questions some of which she could not<br>answer but the really impressive thing<br>was the pet never made up an answer or<br>told you her gut feel<br>ie told you things that might well be<br> she said to us consistently I<br>don't know I'll find out and came back<br>to the next lecture with the answer that<br>we were seeking and I thought that was<br>amazing because it's much easier to tell<br>the students something which makes them<br>go away rather than to admit that not<br>only do not know something but you have<br>to go away and do some work to answer<br>thank you pet for all<br>it is my pleasure to present the small<br>token of appreciation for the speech we<br>have just heard and it is also my role<br>to invite everybody to retire to the<br>staff club where we can have<br>refreshments to celebrate this event<br>however please be seated in the other<br>room as well I have been asked to say we<br>have a surprise and I don't know what<br>the surprise is either but I do know<br>that I am now meant to ask Carlene and<br>thank you very much<br>those of you who are regular attendees<br>to these IPL's I'm sure that you have<br>absolutely no idea what we give people<br>in this gift but it is actually a framed<br>copy of the photograph that is part of<br>the advertisement for these lectures and<br>I think it's a great memento because we<br>spend a lot of times getting these<br>really beautiful photographs and it<br>gives people a real signal of the<br>importance of the event but it turns out<br>that actually in past case we had access<br>to some other photographs that are<br>particularly special because last year<br>those of you who have saw the otago<br>magazine will be very well aware of the<br>story that was run featuring past<br>research Vernon's research and<br>Kristina's research and when we saw<br>those stunning photographs Richard and I<br>thought mm we might be able to do<br>something with those so on behalf of<br>those of us in the Clocktower<br>Pat we would like to give you yet<br>another small memento of your work</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
