Perry key ora<br>koutou katoa no my hurry my welcome<br>everyone it's really great to see so<br>many people here from within the<br>University and also guests from outside<br>of the University this inaugural<br>professorial lecture marks nigel perry's<br>due recognition as a university of otago<br>research professor and i'm going to come<br>back to that classification a little<br>later in my talk very special welcome to<br>professor Perry's wife Tracy and their<br>children Gabrielle Gabriella and Robbie<br>fantastic thank you IPL czar events that<br>I personally regard as very special and<br>the real highlight of the week and the<br>reason I say that is it gives me the<br>opportunity to see some of our brilliant<br>people who work at the University of<br>Otago and the other thing that it<br>reminds me of is that being a university<br>employee is not just about going to<br>meetings not just about convening boards<br>of study and it's not just about<br>administrative problem solving which is<br>what I do a lot of at the moment and it<br>reminds me just how important good<br>teaching and good researchers to the<br>University of Otago in terms of its<br>reputation internationally so inaugural<br>professorial lectures of very special<br>events and tonight is no exception and<br>what we're going to do is just in a<br>moment professor Barker will provide a<br>brief biographical background and so I'm<br>not going to focus on Nigel's stellar<br>career however I will mention that he's<br>rather unusual and he's unusual because<br>we share him with plant and food<br>research which is a crown Research<br>Institute and it provides research and<br>development targets on fruit<br>on vegetable and crop and food products<br>Nigel's a research leader in plant and<br>food but is based in our chemistry<br>department where his research could<br>never be really described as obscure and<br>irrelevant because it supports the<br>sustainable production of high-quality<br>produce driving the design and<br>development of novel functional foods<br>that benefit human health and well-being<br>specifically Nigel research is natural<br>products of chemistry which is all about<br>the compounds that give color and flavor<br>to our foods scent to flowers and<br>inspiration for many of our life-saving<br>drugs now because I chair the University<br>of Staffing Advisory Committee I often<br>talk about how difficult it is to be<br>made a university professor yet because<br>teaching is not formally part of the<br>research professors job I need to single<br>that out as something slightly different<br>and to be a research professor promotion<br>is even harder and it's hardly because<br>you have to be you have to achieve<br>sustained performance at an outstanding<br>level and also leadership in just two<br>areas and there's no slack so whereas<br>for a normal professor you you can get<br>two out of three and the third one is<br>not quite as high in terms of leadership<br>for a research professor you only have<br>two options and there's no ability for<br>the committee to move things around so<br>research professors are very special<br>within the university with nearly 150<br>refereed journal article publications<br>when you applied for the position plus<br>applied spin-offs professor Perry<br>clearly ticks the box for research but<br>as surface as the head of peril which<br>you'll hear about later I've no doubt<br>including commercialization patents<br>contract R&amp;D Plus postgraduate<br>supervision<br>which incidentally research professors<br>don't have to do according to their job<br>description but Nigel unreservedly<br>commits to that all of that is<br>absolutely outstanding and so when<br>considered for research professor it was<br>a very very easy decision for referee<br>supported the application and we had<br>glowing statements such as I give my<br>greatest level of support for this most<br>deserved promotion to the rank of<br>Professor and carry shows superior<br>evidence of being beneficial and<br>scholarly outcomes in my opinion he's<br>already demonstrating the level of<br>competence leadership associated with a<br>professor professorial<br>appointment remembering of course that<br>when he applied he was a lot of<br>professors so what the what the referee<br>was saying was that he'd already<br>achieved that even before he applied so<br>I'm not going to say anymore I'm going<br>to pass over now to the Provost<br>Chancellor of the Division of Sciences<br>professor Richard Barker and he's going<br>to tell us a little bit more about<br>professor Perry's meritorious career<br>Tanaka professor Perry general Kota<br>khatola it's my great pleasure tonight<br>to introduce our speaker professor Nigel<br>Perry to give his inaugural lecture at<br>the University of Otago born in England<br>professor Perry attended High School in<br>Guildford Surrey before heading on to<br>University where he studied chemistry<br>after graduating with first-class honors<br>from the University of Bristol professor<br>Perry began his career as a flavor<br>chemist for spellers limited in the UK<br>and my little bit of research indicated<br>that spellers produced dog food or cat<br>food amongst other things motivate<br>motivated partly by the outstanding<br>Alpine climbing opportunities presented<br>in New Zealand professor Perry wisely<br>chose the University of Otago as a place<br>to study his PhD graduating in 1984 he<br>then commenced a lengthy postdoctoral<br>fellowship at the University of<br>Canterbury which he commenced the 1984<br>and and finished in 1990 in 1991<br>professor Perry was appointed research<br>leader at what is now plant and food<br>research a position that he holds today<br>fortunately for us he only holds that<br>for 80 percent of his time the remaining<br>20 percent of his time he holds a<br>research professor ship and the<br>chemistry department here at Otago<br>professor Perry's research interests<br>combined has understanding of<br>fundamental chemistry with a strong<br>drive to find practical applications<br>this work includes medical and<br>agricultural research and he's worked<br>with a number of groups representing<br>Maori interests here in New Zealand as<br>well as a number of international and<br>New Zealand companies<br>he is currently engaged on research with<br>Tito ahoo on manuka bitters and no Tahu<br>on perfume development from Tamiya<br>Tamiya is also known as wild wild<br>Spaniard and night hire who have been<br>working on this for more than 200 years<br>professor Perry also works with pip<br>fruit New Zealand on sensing disease and<br>apple trees and fight amid limited on<br>relaxants from manuka besides a<br>significant body of published research<br>professor Perry holds six patents<br>including one on an insect attractant<br>now in commercial use around the world<br>for his research on the discovery and<br>development of biologically active<br>natural products<br>professor Perry was awarded the 2013<br>Prize for industrial and applied<br>chemistry by the New Zealand instead of<br>chemistry and Institute that has also<br>recognized him as a fellow he was<br>awarded in New Zealand science and<br>technology medal for excellence in 1984<br>in recognition of his work this evening<br>professor Perry will describe his<br>journey from the University of Bristol<br>to the University of Otago along the way<br>we're going to hear about examples that<br>arose from his PhD research from marine<br>chemistry while he was engaged on his<br>postdoc and significant examples from<br>his current research today trees sponges<br>and B so please welcome professor Nigel<br>Perry<br>technical dough<br>thank you very much Vernon thank you<br>Richard for those some introductory<br>words and thanks you're coming along and<br>thanks the University of Otago for the<br>great honor of appointing me to this<br>research professor position so I'm going<br>to be taking this up and thank you for<br>the opportunity to speak to you tonight<br>to tell you what enthuses me about<br>natural products chemistry and to try<br>and convince you that you should be Tugg<br>the interest in it in fact you are<br>without realizing it because we all like<br>food beverages most of us like flowers<br>and that's what I'm going to be telling<br>you some of that I'm going to run<br>through briefly as Richard said three<br>stories from my career working on trees<br>working on products from the season<br>working on bees but I won't be able to<br>run the RIT for the rest of the lecture<br>and those stages kept me from the<br>University of Otago here on my PhD and<br>I'm going to explain to you something<br>most you will have seen this<br>strange-looking sculpture which is in<br>fact a molecular structure on the end of<br>that fantastic new science one building<br>that's been totally refurbished and I'm<br>going to talk about time antiviral<br>natural product from around Otago<br>harbour out whichever way it is it's<br>hard to tell me such as it isn't it then<br>I'm going to talk to you about bees and<br>the hidden danger that may be lurking in<br>the favorite food for a lot of us and<br>honey and I'm going to talk about unique<br>New Zealand molecules ones that some of<br>them have still only been found in New<br>Zealand so all of them were first found<br>here in New Zealand and the techniques<br>that we use in chemistry to discover<br>these invisible molecules and work on<br>them on a tiny scale so why natural<br>products chemistry what is it as we've<br>said it's a study of one aspect is a<br>study of natural colors scents and<br>flavors around us and that as Richard is<br>says that's why plant and food is one of<br>our interests in that we breed apples we<br>breed kiwi fruit new varieties of wine<br>so<br>we want to control and improve the<br>flavors and colors of those it's also<br>natural products chemistry is what<br>different species use to communicate<br>between one another in positive ways<br>like the colors and scents of flowers<br>that attract pollinating insects bees<br>but also toxins there's a sort of<br>chemical warfare between the lot of<br>organisms going on they can't run away<br>some of them micro organisms and so on<br>plants they can defend themselves by<br>producing natural products at a toxic<br>that give them and can protect them from<br>herbivores and from other organisms we<br>want to understand that toxicity I'm<br>going to give you an example of that but<br>and we can also use that for our own<br>benefit for example microorganism soil<br>microorganisms produce natural products<br>called ever Meccans<br>and those are included in we we can now<br>use those to protect our cattle and<br>sheep with Poron drenches plants of<br>course have been the earliest medicines<br>of humans and we can refine those<br>natural products and half of our current<br>pharmaceuticals is estimated a closely<br>derived or inspired by natural products<br>chemistry and to recognize the<br>importance of this and the fact the 2015<br>Nobel Prize for medicine was awarded to<br>three natural products chemists for<br>their work on the Arthur MEC tins and on<br>the anti-malarial compounds artemisinin<br>which is saving millions of lives from<br>parasitic diseases across the tropics so<br>is that sort of role of natural products<br>chemistry that I was introduced to at<br>the University of Bristol and in<br>particular by Professor mark whiting who<br>was giving undergraduate lectures there<br>and that got me inspired to follow<br>through on that sort of work<br>professor whiting was important my<br>career I did nanos project with him he<br>got me that job in the flavor research<br>industry working with companion animals<br>for flavors and also and then when I<br>decided that I did do I want to do some<br>more formal research training to do a<br>PhD he had had an inquiry from professor<br>Ted Corbett who is the head of this<br>department chemistry department here at<br>the target at the time looking for a<br>student what Ted Corbett wanted was<br>somebody to work on the chemistry some<br>unique chemistry of New Zealand trees of<br>course being English I hadn't come<br>across New Zealand trees but when I<br>started looking into that it turns out<br>that natural products chemistry is with<br>all New Zealand's native trees has been<br>very important for the economic<br>development of New Zealand so not just<br>their timber but I mean that in<br>particular from Kerry its Kerry gum so<br>this is the it's truly a resin that<br>oozes out of damaged kerry trees and as<br>accumulated in the swamps in Northland<br>and it stated that the early Auckland<br>was built on gum from 1850 to 1950<br>exports total 450,000 tons and that was<br>being used overseas as very high quality<br>varnish okay and that was found in the<br>swamps from old Kerry or where they died<br>and been growing for thousands of years<br>but that became mined out of course and<br>then they to keep that going people<br>started climbing the trees and not as an<br>alpine ice climber I was fascinated to<br>see this picture from this book of a gum<br>climber so they've got pics in each hand<br>spikes on the front of the boots and<br>that's exactly the technique that we<br>were using my friends were moving the<br>Alps and in the Barrens but he said that<br>that had only been invented in the 1960s<br>so New Zealand climbing could have made<br>an even greater leap forward if we'd<br>adapted that if that had been taken up<br>for ice climbing earlier on so the<br>chemistry this is mainly a compound<br>called a gothic acid named after the<br>genus of kerry agathis and it was<br>described first from that and I've got<br>to introduce you to this sort of diagram<br>which shows the structures of natural<br>products and all organic compounds which<br>are based on carbon and hydrogen with<br>varying amounts of oxygen nitrogen and<br>then other elements some people refer to<br>these as chicken wire diagrams and<br>you'll see why later on but the point<br>here is that we're carbon-based life<br>forms so to save time we just draw these<br>diagrams where we assume that every<br>vertex every angle on this diagram is a<br>carbon atom and it's carrying its<br>requisite number of hydrogens so it's<br>four coordinate carbon so if it's bonded<br>to do carbons it's also bonded to two<br>hydrogen's so that's some of the basis<br>of these structures the project that Ted<br>Corbett wanted to follow up on was from<br>another New Zealand native tree and<br>other endemic tree only found in New<br>Zealand the remove most you will be<br>familiar with remove I hope one of our<br>great forests trees that grows<br>extensively well it's the most<br>widespread of our forests reefs goes all<br>the way from Northland down to the north<br>of Dan Stewart Island and the foliage of<br>that contains this molecule which is the<br>one shown on the end of the science one<br>building and it's called Lauren II now<br>that's called learning after Dennis<br>Lauren who did they is actually working<br>for plant and food research now though<br>he's semi-retired and he did a fantastic<br>amount of work in his PhD study on that<br>determining this chemical structure this<br>weird thing about this chemical<br>structure is that you've got a central<br>carbon atom bonded to four different<br>carbons so that's normally enough but<br>those are also fused together in this<br>series of rings and that sort of<br>structure had been suggested as a<br>possibility theoretically by Roald<br>Hoffmann Nobel prize-winning I'm a great<br>chemists who he actually spoken<br>2013 and he and co-authors there had<br>suggested it might be possible to get<br>what they called fenestrae touch<br>structures in which there was this<br>central carbon atom fused in these four<br>rings and what you could have there was<br>then possibly enough strain to to<br>flatten out the carbon because carbon<br>one of its properties that makes it<br>really the building block of our<br>molecules of life is that it has this<br>four bonding capacity and it's also<br>three-dimensional so this is a<br>tetrahedral type structure so if you're<br>trying to squeeze that into rings that<br>and get it towards a flat structure that<br>will introduce a lot of strain so they<br>thought theoretically could those V<br>produce and so penny strains after the<br>window pane cracked structure or rosette<br>a and lauren een once the structure of<br>that was determined turned out to be the<br>only naturally-occurring finished strain<br>or rosette a and that's still true today<br>so that is the intrinsic interest it's a<br>New Zealand molecule it's a Dunedin<br>molecule in fact this is the crystal<br>structure here so that managed to get a<br>brominated derivative and make a crystal<br>that diffracted x-rays and determine the<br>actual structure of the molecule and you<br>might be able to see there that that's<br>the central carbon there and it's not in<br>fact flat but that structure did show<br>that there is a lot of strain in that<br>molecule which I'll come back to him in<br>little so that was the thing that<br>professor Corbett had set up as a<br>research project and because when they<br>were trying to get more Lauren into<br>study its chemistry they went back to<br>another Rima tree and they found almost<br>no detectable learning in that<br>particular individual tree went to<br>another one fountain so there was some<br>natural variation in there and the idea<br>was to study that and we might<br>understand then what factors led to that<br>variation perhaps we could understand<br>from<br>occurring compounds how you could get<br>such a strain molecule in nature and<br>whether it has any role in the in the<br>survival of ecological role and the<br>survival of the tree so my first job<br>when I got here actually I professor<br>Galba handed me on that's when he first<br>met me I don't know two wrecks Weaver's<br>who was a to be my PhD supervisor who's<br>a great supervisor FET very encouraging<br>very supported and with Rex we planned a<br>campaign of sampling but first of all we<br>needed to be able to measure the<br>concentration of learning in really<br>foliage it's a colorless odorless<br>molecule reasonably low concentration so<br>I had to use some of the techniques I'd<br>learned in the flavor research and<br>extraction techniques that I could take<br>lots of samples of foliage with<br>different treatments and measure the<br>concentrations of learning and that so<br>this graph here you can see the old sort<br>of approach in the typesetting from my<br>thesis for teary me trees and analyzed<br>those by graphic chromatography measured<br>the relative amounts of learning and<br>there were some trees there which have<br>mostly learning ones here which had<br>almost no detectable learning and then<br>there was an intermediate group and that<br>these had another compound which is<br>actually called renewing named after the<br>tree of course and characteristic of<br>that tree and found in New Zealand also<br>as the dominant compound in that class<br>and then there was some with<br>intermediate composition roughly equal<br>composition of those so yet there was<br>the variation so what was causing that<br>variation I tried all sorts of different<br>factors we looked at the gender of the<br>trees remove has separate male and<br>female trees male trees with the spore<br>releasing of pollen releasing cones<br>female trees of the fruiting cones but<br>that didn't make any difference of<br>proportion of learning juvenile foliage<br>and the young trees have this attractive<br>drooping type foliage and then it gets a<br>bit more mass smaller leagues and a<br>different form when it's a doubt but<br>that didn't make a difference<br>was it something do with the position on<br>the tree so I went at Rex Weaver's and I<br>went at the Otago cows forest just after<br>Tory mouth and got to look through a<br>tree to climb for me to climb I think I<br>did take my ice axes and crampons but<br>luckily I found a a tree which had these<br>two trunks so that was easy to bridge up<br>across those climb up that get samples<br>up and down the tree go up to however I<br>felt safe and which was quite high then<br>not now and took those samples back to<br>lab then I extracted those started<br>analyzing them and I started to see a<br>pattern in the composition there I could<br>see two groups of samples with different<br>compositions are at last I've got<br>something that's different here but then<br>we went back to a target cow's forest<br>looked at the tree that I had climbed<br>with its twin trunks it turned out it<br>was actually two trees is - Sam -<br>saplings had started growing together<br>and they'd intertwined and grown up<br>which was why is easy to climb but it<br>also meant there were two individuals<br>there we obviously had exactly the same<br>environments so it wasn't an<br>environmental effect it wasn't a height<br>effect something with genetic control<br>and in a sense that's as well the but<br>that did vary the proportion around the<br>country so you can see for the Otago<br>coast forests about half of the trees<br>had almost no detectable renewing only a<br>few a small proportion of them that ten<br>percent of them had that sorry no<br>detectable learning and only a small<br>proportion of them had dominant learning<br>it was some similar from Puri Ora just<br>north of topo<br>and but over on the west coast at<br>hokitika it was quite a different<br>picture significantly different in terms<br>of statistics and we analyzed enough<br>trees collect enough trees college from<br>enough trees and their three quarters of<br>those trees we sampled were dominated by<br>learning and only one really out of ten<br>had had low Lauryn team in it I had to<br>leave that project then I worked on<br>other pota cuts and other interesting<br>systems I wasn't able to solve the<br>ultimate question while earning Rex<br>Weaver's with various students kept<br>working on looking for learning and<br>working on the native gymnosperms<br>looking at related compounds and then<br>Don Clark working with Rex found<br>collected Totoro from around the country<br>Podocarpus a separate genus and he did<br>find using the same techniques that I'd<br>I'd set up in the first place I suppose<br>extraction gas chromatographic analysis<br>he did find a trace of learning and a<br>few individual Totoro trees from the<br>west coast and he could confirm that by<br>isolating the compound and he also<br>isolated this compound co-occurring with<br>learning and that is compound while they<br>named it up the y whole river over on<br>the west coast they called that Y ho n<br>scene and if you look at that structure<br>there these two rings here a rough are<br>preserved from the learning structure<br>but there's been a movement around the<br>molecule here that group has shifted<br>across there this bond has shifted to<br>there in Y haven't seen and that one<br>this one has shifted to there and these<br>this is another peculiar but well<br>peculiar very valuable property of<br>carbon molecule containing molecules<br>they can undergo these rearrangements<br>and in this case what had happened<br>during the synthesis of Laura named by<br>whatever route in which we still don't<br>understand there had been a bit of slack<br>perhaps in the biosynthetic pathway and<br>they'd been a further rearrangement to<br>release some of the strain of that<br>molecule but we still don't know how<br>particularly that's produced or why it's<br>not biologically active we couldn't find<br>any biological activity for that<br>molecule but the trees well we would<br>think in terms of evolution they're<br>devoting this energy this this highly<br>specialized synthetic mechanism for some<br>reason but we haven't been able to work<br>out why but I had so it remains a sort<br>of academic question but some of the<br>techniques I'll come back to because<br>I've applied them to a much more<br>practical application in their current<br>work on Monica so I'd finished my PhD<br>then in 1984 as you heard and I was very<br>lucky that John Blanton Mon Mon Monroe<br>at the University of Otago were just<br>setting up a marine natural products<br>research group that got some really good<br>funding and they were looking for<br>anti-tumor an antiviral compounds from<br>marine natural products so this is where<br>we go diving under the seas now they set<br>up a group with chemists postdoctoral<br>chemists I was one of those with Rob<br>lake with a buy-sell biologist doing<br>antiviral essays and cytotoxicity assays<br>with marine biologists with diving<br>experience and so we were going to<br>collect marine organisms from all around<br>New Zealand and test those for their<br>biological activities that could<br>potentially developed into<br>pharmaceuticals I took the opportunity<br>of learning scuba diving so I got to go<br>on some fantastic trips diving all<br>around New Zealand Fiordland was a<br>highlight and also down to the Antarctic<br>ice on one trip and that's there when<br>you look at the the ice frozen on the<br>Ross Sea and only 30 metres down there's<br>incredibly rich life on the sea floor<br>underneath including sponges like this<br>green latter and kulia species there and<br>I'd actually worked on that in New<br>Zealand and worked on the Antarctic<br>collection and found that being able to<br>isolate now is one<br>person to report in the chemical<br>literature the Isis that the this<br>structure here which you can see has not<br>only got the carbon it's got sulfur it's<br>got bromine it's got much a really<br>amazing molecule I think so collecting<br>there under the ice was a fantastic<br>opportunity it's you have to think about<br>that was for the chemistry but the<br>physics comes into play of course in<br>Antarctica you're diving in obviously<br>this is me a crack in the ice I think I<br>was about to go down<br>but what you have to do there is you<br>have to watch out for the physics you've<br>got your scuba tank on your back the<br>compressed air has to loop be<br>decompressed and down to atmospheric<br>pressure and that decompression takes<br>heat out of its environment so you can<br>get ice building up on your regulator<br>there this can have two effects it can<br>either Jam open which isn't too good<br>because your is going out very fast<br>which is why we always dived on on<br>tethers or on ropes that we could be<br>sure that we could get back or we got<br>back to our entry point our hole will<br>crack in the ice or your regulator might<br>jam shut which is also not good when you<br>have down at 30 meters but we did have a<br>spare regulator on the side for that so<br>I didn't have to do this that you would<br>then be searching for that to put in<br>your mouth to get back to the hole I<br>found it quite nerve-wracking actually<br>the so there's also great diving out in<br>the Otago harbour and we did collection<br>trips came down from Canterbury based<br>ourselves in the University of Otago<br>brought to be Portobello marine lab it<br>was the old lab at the time when I<br>started which was now it's a fantastic<br>facility they're being rebuilt again<br>there of course the and we were diving<br>in the Targo harbour and we know we've<br>got great seat the great life that we<br>see on the surface the seals the<br>albatrosses shags the penguins and there<br>of course all dependent on the abundant<br>life in the seawater and this flow of<br>tidal flow in and out of there and the<br>nutrients coming down the land around<br>gives fantastic growth in there I was<br>diving at one part a trip between<br>quarantine island and over towards port<br>Chalmers and you could those sponges and<br>the meaning trusting life was about this<br>thick on those walls you wouldn't<br>suspect that just incredibly rich life<br>one of the places we died was at at<br>Harrington point out towards the<br>albatross colony and we found this<br>fairly unprepossessing looking yellowish<br>green sponge but when we got this back<br>with our other collections back to the<br>lab in man Canterbury did extracts of<br>those and that showed up as having<br>strong antiviral activity so it<br>inhibited the growth of poliovirus<br>in a Cell host cell so that made it a<br>top priority to study that but you've<br>got a sponge it's the most primitive<br>form of multicellular life and so you<br>can't really divide into leaves and<br>twigs we just blended that with organic<br>solvents so you've got this mush filter<br>off the solids that are soluble and<br>you've got a solution that's got<br>everything from the sea salt the<br>proteins our DNA all the weight the<br>lipids make up the cell membrane so it's<br>a real chemical haystack and we're<br>trying to extend find the bioactive<br>needle the particular molecule that's<br>giving the antiviral activity so what we<br>do for that is bioactivity biological<br>activity directed chromatography so<br>chromatography we started to separate<br>out the chemical components into<br>fractions and then we test each of those<br>for the biological activity and in this<br>case from this sponge out we only had to<br>go through two or three stages of<br>fractionation and I had something looked<br>like a pure compound by the tests that I<br>could do I had about two milligrams two<br>thousandth of a gram of that and it's a<br>pale yellow oil you could barely see<br>that amount I could get enough results<br>on that at the time to show me that it<br>was a compound that wasn't known in the<br>chemical literature at all hadn't been<br>reported before and that it was named<br>Hunter<br>it's working now my car Lamar day<br>because there was some related compounds<br>but 2002 the gram well then the<br>techniques were quite uh weren't quite<br>up to solving that structure so we had<br>to go back and collect again and the<br>first time we went back and we went out<br>Harrington point there was a bit of a<br>shock because we couldn't find any of<br>this sponge which had been reasonably<br>abundant there before we thought we<br>haven't wiped it out has there been some<br>somebody straight dragged a net across<br>it or what's happened but it turned out<br>the sponge is seasonal there's enough<br>nutrients there and it grows fast and it<br>came up in spring so we got back to<br>diving there in spring and got enough<br>material of sponge that I could purify<br>about twenty milligrams and then at that<br>stage I had enough to solve the<br>structure as it turned out the first<br>thing you do you're starting with<br>unknown molecule you need to know how<br>many atoms are in there first at what's<br>the size of the chemical puzzle that<br>you've got to put together so we use a<br>technique called mass spectrometry<br>that's the most sensitive analytical<br>technique we've got you ionize the<br>molecules accelerate them through an<br>electric in magnetic fields and very<br>accurately measure their molecular mass<br>and you measure it so accurately you can<br>work out how many carbon atoms are there<br>you see 24 how many hydrogen atoms how<br>many nitrogens oxygens any other<br>elements so that was the size of the<br>puzzle that I had to put together and<br>the next stage tool for doing that is a<br>technique called nuclear magnetic<br>resonance spectroscopy and that in that<br>we use superconducting magnets cooled<br>with liquid helium put the sample in<br>that and once you've got that extremely<br>high magnetic field we can get separate<br>signals for all the carbon atoms and for<br>all the hydrogen atoms in the molecule<br>and we can understand from the where<br>those signals occur and the shape of the<br>signals how they all connect together so<br>then I could start<br>putting together pieces of this molecule<br>and I got this sort of circled portion<br>of the molecule and I thought well that<br>was quite a good piece that I could<br>start searching the chemical literature<br>I knew that the whole molecule was new<br>but it seemed like where it didn't seem<br>likely really I've got something<br>entirely new it's always possible that<br>could have been like Lauren T but I did<br>a search anyway and did that fairly late<br>at night at the University of Canterbury<br>I was sitting there and I got a hit from<br>that search and that was sort of<br>disappointing in the way it meant there<br>was another molecule that was similar<br>but it did get gaping the answer<br>accelerated the progress towards the<br>answer and the hit that I got was a<br>compound that was called Pedram I hadn't<br>heard of that but when I looked up the<br>chemical arm where it was reported it<br>came from something called a blister<br>beetle the genus Pedras I hadn't heard<br>of those either but in some catastrophic<br>or countries also in Iraq and even in<br>Australia there are some of these<br>beetles that release this compound<br>Pedram that has a blistering effect on<br>your skin and can be quite a pest and I<br>actually demonstrated later on in the<br>project unfortunately I shouldn't really<br>be telling you this that are<br>sufficiently clumsy chemists you can I<br>hope you can just see across here some<br>blisters across the back of her hand<br>which healed very nicely that was also<br>one of the properties of Hedren that had<br>been noted so I knew had a closely<br>related compound and then I was able to<br>put together the rest of the structure<br>of my column I day and the rest of the<br>structure was quite similar to the<br>Pedram from the blister beetle so that's<br>a real mystery how can you have<br>something in a brain sponge in Otago<br>harbour that is similar to beetles<br>terrestrial beetles in completely<br>different countries around the rest of<br>the world and then another aspect of<br>this puzzle came up a question came up<br>at the same time we're working with<br>Japanese chemists collaborated with<br>Japanese colleagues and they had a<br>sponge from the Northern Pacific near<br>Japan<br>and they had isolated biologically<br>active compound they were working on the<br>structure putting together the same way<br>and since we're collaborating we shared<br>the structures before we published them<br>and they had got this Gump and they<br>called on my day from this sponge quite<br>a different sponge and it had the same<br>portion there as I'd found in my column<br>I day and very similar to peg read so<br>this was even more of a puzzle different<br>sponges and then terrestrial beetle at<br>the time when we publish that back in<br>1988 we speculated that it could perhaps<br>be due to symbiotic microorganisms and<br>their sponges are full of that symbiotic<br>Michel not surprisingly they feed on<br>them basically and some of them survive<br>and grow within them so we speculate on<br>that but we didn't have the tools of<br>molecular biology at the time to study<br>that but it did turn out that nearly 20<br>years later you can people working with<br>John blood to may Monroe and others did<br>find that the pedram type pathway they<br>could trace that to an uncultivated and<br>uncultivated<br>bacterium in there or bacterial pathways<br>so we'd been right about that so that<br>was sort of a highlight of my work at<br>the University of Canterbury<br>unfortunately that compound didn't get<br>developed as a medicinal wine compound<br>because the antiviral mode of action was<br>by protein synthesis inhibition in<br>eukaryotic cells and of course we've<br>made up of eukaryotic cells so we can't<br>really afford to stop that going on but<br>there have been other compounds from<br>colleagues bitten off good and Chris<br>battle at Victoria University of<br>Wellington have found different<br>compounds that do have potential<br>anti-tumor activity from the same<br>Macally species but different bacterial<br>symbols so moving on to the most recent<br>stage of my career coming back here got<br>the the job here a joint appointment it<br>was an initiative between Professor<br>Brian Robinson in the chemistry<br>department<br>and between dr. Conway pal in math<br>technology as it was at the time out of<br>Denver may they want to set up this<br>joint unit which is called the time was<br>called the pint extracts Research Unit<br>as we you heard Peru which is sometimes<br>a confusing acronym when people say<br>they're going to visit Peru just do a<br>short trip we've been working on yeah<br>the applied aspects of musing and<br>natural products chemistry obviously the<br>marine natural products chemistry was<br>looking for apply applications in terms<br>of pharmaceuticals we've we've worked on<br>things that are closer to you know<br>commercial development so as as you<br>heard we've been working with night ahoo<br>on Terra Mia on the spear grass that<br>gives so much of a pain to some trampers<br>we working on developing the perfume of<br>that that's been traditionally used by<br>Mary into a modern product with a<br>sustainable production system been<br>working on hora Peter mostly will<br>recognize that bush pepper up in the<br>town belt and so on it's got that very<br>pungent peppery taste and we've looked<br>at have a chemistry of the pungent<br>compound and that red coloration that<br>develops gives signals to herbivorous<br>insects and in an ecological project<br>that we got Marsland funding for we're<br>working on apple diseases as I think<br>Richard mentioned analytical techniques<br>for detecting diseases of apples before<br>the symptoms arise that they could be<br>save money by not growing them on not<br>planting them out one of the main<br>research themes that we've had on the<br>news that native plants has been on<br>Monica again well it's it's more<br>widespread than remotes our most<br>widespread native plant growing all the<br>way from Northland all across Stewart<br>island on the other offshore islands and<br>this has unique chemistry as well most<br>of you will know about we're all welcome<br>you on that will know about Monica honey<br>but you'll know less about the Monica<br>oil this is from Foley<br>on the East Cape there's a commercial<br>production of a volatile oil from the<br>leaves of Monica and that contains an<br>antimicrobial component this shown here<br>which has called Leptis permit that's<br>named after the lettuce vermin genus<br>that moniker is in and was first found<br>in Monica and also from some Australian<br>lettuce Berman species and that has<br>antimicrobial activity against<br>gram-positive bacteria in fact it's got<br>antimicrobial activity against strains<br>of antibiotic resistant bacteria and<br>we've done work on that with Phil Bremer<br>and with Greg cook and that has some<br>potential for treating of school sores<br>which are becoming resistant to me<br>Pearson and other antibiotics we've also<br>looked at and the point here is that we<br>were using that sort of technique that I<br>had some of those techniques are<br>developed in my PhD work or the concept<br>that you know just because it's one bar<br>technical species doesn't mean has to<br>have identical chemistry all the way<br>through its range and that's very true<br>well true of them they try ketones you<br>see help here on the East Cape the red<br>dot shows that the distilled ores have<br>greater than 15% of the antimicrobial<br>Leptis berman and related compounds<br>whereas just down the road in gisbert<br>much lower concentrations and around<br>here and Dunedin hardly detectable much<br>lower and cathartic activity but these<br>other areas had some interesting<br>chemistry as well distinct chemistry for<br>example from Golden Bay we've found<br>there's a really a I believe it's really<br>attractive scented oil or flavored oil<br>as well which has a spicy citrus type<br>aroma and flavor and it makes a<br>delicious marinade on green-lipped<br>mussels they're for one example and<br>we've also found compounds related to<br>the lecture sperm own we just reported<br>those fairly recently<br>that have that that have never been<br>reported from anywhere else in the world<br>and they have the nearest structures to<br>those in hops now the hops that we use<br>to flavor beer so what we're trying to<br>do now is look at weather and we have<br>some indications that these naught rye<br>ketones are going to have bitter flavors<br>as well so what we're looking at now is<br>producing finding plants working with<br>tato eheu which is a group of Mary EE<br>across Nelson ma bruh and we've been out<br>collecting individual plants and we're<br>just in the process of analyzing that<br>it's the high levels these naught rye<br>ketones plus the attractive aroma<br>compounds so what we might be able to do<br>is develop with the merry landowners and<br>New Zealand food and medical beverage<br>companies a Monica bitters type the<br>genuine of unique New Zealand beverage<br>not necessarily alcoholic that you know<br>would then have a the novelty value that<br>beverage markets are seeking I mentioned<br>Monica honey that we're all familiar<br>with this again is contains not a unique<br>New Zealand natural product but a very<br>simple one which is this three carbon<br>die hard rock c2 hydroxyl groups acetone<br>you might recognize there<br>dihydroxyacetone in the nectar at<br>unusually high levels much higher<br>concentrations and they've been reported<br>in any other nectars of other plants<br>from around the world except for vector<br>spearmint in Australia so because they<br>have biologically active honey's as well<br>and this is converted to an<br>antimicrobial component when the honey<br>is stored and that gives the value then<br>that's what is has seen this boom in<br>Monica honey sales 233 million in 2015<br>up to 280 million in 2016 in last year<br>but there are various and this is export<br>okay so it's a valuable industry but as<br>you've been hearing on the news last cup<br>a few days little rust is a major threat<br>to that<br>so obviously planting food and NPI and<br>dark and so on we're also wouldn't<br>trying to work out what we can do my<br>hope is that that variability of what<br>it's called Monica across New Zealand<br>there will be resistance drains across<br>New Zealand there but there is another<br>threat to New Zealand honey<br>in general it's been known for a long<br>time that since European bees were<br>introduced into New Zealand in 1839 as<br>early as 1857 their reports of deaths<br>from people eating honey that they'd<br>found collecting the bush or even from<br>beehives that they were looking after<br>and a colleague of as implant and Food<br>Research mark good witness written a<br>short book about it and that boom in<br>Monica honey has led to there has been a<br>sort of a Food Safety Authority<br>regulations I've come back to that for a<br>long time but the boom in Monica honey<br>has led to less experienced beekeepers<br>and that some one of those was actually<br>poisoned and various people who had some<br>of his honey in the Coromandel area in<br>2008 rather unpleasant symptoms delirium<br>seizures variable memory loss and as<br>I've said they're happy not in this case<br>or not recently have been deaths from<br>this poisoning so question of course was<br>why why's the be snoozing in Tunney's<br>have these neurotoxins in them the edge<br>of symptoms were a clue to that because<br>the native plant - - which is various<br>Cori aureus species native to New<br>Zealand had been known for a long time<br>as well known to be toxic Mary knew all<br>about no toxicity so despite that they<br>managed to make a safe beverage out of<br>carefully expressing the juice without<br>getting the seeds included in that from<br>- - but generally there's a lot of<br>neurotoxicity basically don't try this<br>at home the and that has the same<br>symptoms of these seizures and delirium<br>and so on so they tested<br>and this cop was tracked down to a<br>compound that was named Tooting as a<br>neurotoxin Tooting from tutu and its<br>structure was determined and it has been<br>found with one or two other plant plants<br>overseas but not a large number and it<br>was found in toxic honey's okay so then<br>the question was how do these get the<br>neurotoxin from the plant into the honey<br>because the obvious thing would be if it<br>was in the nectar but it's not they<br>don't produce nectar it's not in the<br>pollen so how were they doing that<br>there's a really good piece of field<br>work scientific detective work that the<br>researchers published in here that there<br>were these leaf hoppers that barn<br>hoppers that actually sat feeding and I<br>have they plumb into the SAP of the<br>plant of the to tube plant they get the<br>sugars that they want and they excrete<br>what they don't need because they're<br>getting a massive amount of sugar and it<br>turns out and this is called honey dew<br>as well like the beach honey dew but and<br>that contains the Tooting and bees can<br>will collect that and that gets into the<br>hives so then the food safety<br>authorities had to bring in the<br>regulations that so anywhere where there<br>is - - which is most places whether it's<br>bush around New Zealand and these vine<br>hoppers which is most of the North<br>Island and north of the South Island you<br>have to get all your hunting tested for<br>the Tooting concentration a lot of<br>testing being done to keep it safe and<br>there is a regulatory limit on that of<br>that to parts per million at the time<br>when we started doing this work tooten<br>had been identified but they also the<br>original researchers on that also<br>thought there could be they sort of<br>delayed onset symptoms of poisoning as<br>well I thought could be due to other<br>components and this was followed up by<br>Food Safety Australia New Zealand<br>researchers berry fields and colleagues<br>published the study in 2014 where they<br>actually got ethics permission<br>to feed healthy male volunteers<br>Wellington students the a safe dose<br>calculated safe dose of honey containing<br>a calculated safe amounted to ting and<br>they took blood okay over time so it's a<br>pharmacokinetics study like the ones<br>that we do with drugs to check out well<br>they're absorb and there was instantly<br>after they'd had their honey on toast<br>there was an increase in the toxin in<br>there and then it start to come down but<br>then there is this long slow build-up<br>over 24 hours at 48 hours are still<br>detectable - - and the researchers<br>thought yes that is due to Tooting being<br>released from some conjugate form in<br>there and we needed to know what that<br>was as a food safety issue okay<br>unfortunately my group our group in<br>plant and Food Research we got the<br>contract to do that work because we have<br>done previous work on Tooting so to find<br>out where what the bioactive molecules<br>giving this a long term potential<br>poisoning we needed some way of<br>detecting those we couldn't do<br>biological assays obviously that's not<br>ethical or safe so we had to use an<br>instrumental technique and I've talked<br>about mass spectrometry before so that's<br>the technique that you ionize a molecule<br>very sensitive you can measure the<br>molecular composition but you can also<br>feed in enough energies that the<br>molecule can come apart into fragments<br>and what we did with that was we had<br>introducing the samples separating by<br>liquid chromatography so as a time<br>separation of components there and then<br>mass spectrometry and so what we were<br>looking for were molecules that would<br>give a ionize and give a molecular<br>formula but we could put more energy<br>into that and recognize a fragment that<br>was actually the toxic tooting in there<br>so in this this was a foliage extract<br>that's the Tooting peak it has this mass<br>of the the iron with various things<br>added to it at 3:39 and then in the<br>toxic in a toxic<br>honey sample we found earlier Peaks that<br>also gave a 339 to tintype fragment and<br>so these were the conjugates these forms<br>that we're looking for and the added<br>mass corresponding to either a glucose<br>or similar fructose or similar molecule<br>and we also found one with two glucose<br>or fructose or similar molecules that<br>was as much as we could tell from the<br>mass spec but we needed to know their<br>full structures so we did that by again<br>getting back to the nuclear magnetic<br>resonance spectroscopy but we had had<br>them pure so this was again another<br>needle - this time a sticky haystack and<br>lacey lassen did fantastic work<br>purifying the two conjugates there from<br>that from a massive toxic honey and then<br>we could run the NMR spectra so that<br>we're getting signals for each carbon<br>along here and getting signals from all<br>the hydrogens and we could start to that<br>same process of putting together the<br>parts of the molecule and so we've got<br>an intact<br>tooting as we expected that's what's<br>released in the body in the digestion<br>but it's got bonded on to it a super<br>tight molecule that this has - and we<br>can also use the NMR spectroscopy and<br>tell which what the actual structure is<br>around the carbon atoms there so we got<br>that full structure and we published<br>that we passed on - obviously we<br>informed<br>Ministry of Primary Industries about<br>that and the problem with that was that<br>we couldn't actually get enough of that<br>to give analytical standards for the<br>full analyses despite getting some<br>universe of otago research grant funding<br>to drum since these molecules we weren't<br>quite successful in that and the the<br>ratio of the so you got straight tooting<br>in the top two comings but you've also<br>got differing rate ratios of these some<br>sugar conjugates in there so you can get<br>different toxic effects if you've got<br>different relationships of those so food<br>safety Australian New Zealand had to<br>lower the threshold from the<br>thinking for Tooting itself which was<br>what was being tested for in honey<br>from two parts million doubt and I had<br>to cut that by a third to give a<br>calculated safe Dogz<br>so that was a real exciting outcome for<br>us we could really make a difference to<br>food safety in New Zealand and<br>potentially for our export market so to<br>wrap up I've shown you that knowledge of<br>natural products is essential for public<br>health as I've talked about and also the<br>new medicines that I know it was that we<br>had to go at that and you can get this<br>at molecular view of nature you can link<br>the molecular biology the botany the<br>ecology together so I think it's a<br>fascinating topic and there are still<br>other unique molecules to be found out<br>there Oliver Watkins is working with<br>Kirk Krauss and Miriam sharp knives<br>actually shown that the we haven't quite<br>got the full structure but that's the<br>New Zealand glowworm that we all know<br>about but the chemistry has not been<br>known and all of this has shown that<br>it's a new week molecule in there as<br>well<br>still to be found so finally it's need<br>to thank all my colleagues over the<br>years and students I'm working with now<br>especially my current team here thank my<br>family my parents Thea and Brian and my<br>brother and sisters thank our children<br>unloyal Hampton I'm the head of the<br>chemistry department it's my pleasure to<br>thank Nigel for his for his excellent<br>talk and to make a presentation from the<br>energy first of all so I'll do that now<br>nice thank you longer bring the lecture<br>thank you mark I believe really come up<br>and I can I just put the date on things<br>but I will remember today Nigel got his<br>PhD because we went round to Rick's<br>readers home and we take these on this<br>one's table so I remember the day that<br>makes me very old I remember the day<br>that I was released via CNN and thank<br>you for your lecture tonight and it was<br>great I think they have some of that<br>history of a learning molecule to<br>proudly have attached to the end of our<br>building now are fleshed out and I think<br>you can see the interesting history<br>still yet to be resolved the actual use<br>of learning in class but there it is on<br>the end of that building there you know<br>was it acknowledges I mean the reason<br>that we chose irony was to acknowledge<br>the strong history that the department<br>has had in natural products chemistry<br>and Nigel is some one of the many<br>members of the of a chemistry team who<br>have pursued those sorts of products<br>over the years and continued particular<br>I think was the water the Nobel Prize in<br>2015 we can see we expect the resurgence<br>perhaps in natural products chemistry<br>but idle thank you very much for you I<br>think it's really interesting to see the<br>impact of the work that people do and<br>for us in the chemistry department to<br>have a CRI embedded in our department<br>through the Peru unit the plants and<br>extracts unit now has been in the<br>department for 20 years<br>Nigel and and the staff support interest<br>in natural product chemistry they<br>provide a vision for students and are<br>engaged in the teaching and just the<br>general life of the department it's<br>something that we I think is with your<br>leadership in that role have engaged<br>really seriously with the department and<br>synergic relationship so I think<br>symbiotic symbiotic and so it just<br>remains now for me to invite you<br>all there's a staff club where you'll<br>find well the things that Nigel rather<br>means to celebrate the texture on the<br>pro se once again this technologist was<br>excellent</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
