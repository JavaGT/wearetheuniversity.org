John Ward who was here<br>with us this evening we have also<br>received very generous response support<br>from companies including Westpac Naylor<br>love and Aero international the<br>university is truly grateful to each and<br>every one of these individuals and<br>organizations for their support of this<br>very important share now when we were<br>considering mark for the position we<br>sought feedback from internationally<br>recognized experts in his area of work<br>and on the basis of that feedback we<br>learned a few things about mark we<br>learned that he was a passionate<br>scientist an effective leader and a<br>genuinely nice guy and any of you who<br>have had the chance to interact with<br>mark since he has joined our ranks will<br>know that he has made good on all of<br>those promises so professor Stirling on<br>behalf of the University I would like to<br>warmly welcome you we are extremely<br>pleased to have you here I will now call<br>on the pro vice-chancellor of the<br>division of Sciences professor Richard<br>Barker to tell us just a little bit more<br>about marks academic journey to Otago<br>noreda tena koe toh tena koe Toth Anita<br>tokoto<br>Tanaka sohcahtoa it is my great pleasure<br>to introduce our speaker tonight<br>professor mark sterling to give his<br>inaugural preface aerial lecture at the<br>University of Otago born in Auckland<br>professor Stirling lived most of his<br>early life in Blenheim during those<br>formative years he developed an interest<br>in the outdoors and after that he had to<br>make a choice between science arts or<br>aviation and happily for us<br>he chose the sciences and in particular<br>the geological sciences he obtained his<br>PhD at the University of nevada-reno and<br>before that he received his BSC and MSC<br>honours from the superior university<br>today professor Stirling is an<br>earthquake scientist for the<br>multidisciplinary background in geology<br>and seismology his research interests<br>are in the integration of geological<br>seismological and Dyrdek<br>datasets for seismic notic tectonic and<br>seismic hazard modeling in plain English<br>he studies earthquake faults and their<br>associated hazards professor Stirling<br>moved to this present position at the<br>University of Otago in February 2006 to<br>take up the inaugural chair and<br>earthquake science Sciences he was<br>previously principal scientist at gns<br>science where he led the development of<br>the last three versions of the National<br>seismic hazard model for New Zealand<br>1998 in 2002 and 2012 which is the<br>hazard basis for the New Zealand loading<br>standard in addition to has many local<br>projects he is currently working on<br>seismic hazard research for nuclear<br>power plants not sure we were going to<br>put those in hydro dams professor<br>Stirling has been the recipient of two<br>auto glogauer awards from the New<br>Zealand Society of earthquake<br>engineering for his publications and was<br>the society president from 2004 to 2006<br>he was recognized by that Society for<br>his service and was created a fellow<br>in 2007 geographically or geology<br>illogically pardon me New Zealand is a<br>young country located at the boundary of<br>two major tectonic plates the forces<br>released from collisions from those<br>plates is something that every New<br>Zealand er is very aware and our Vice<br>Chancellor has just graphically reminded<br>us of many of those things they shape<br>the environment in which we live they<br>generate our earthquakes but they also<br>give us the spectacular mountains and<br>volcanoes that characterize our Islands<br>tonight professor Stirling will provide<br>an overview of his career as a<br>geomorphologist<br>as a geologist as an earthquake<br>scientist offering his perspective on<br>these processes that shape our country<br>and affect our lives in addition to<br>sharing his working knowledge of pure<br>morphology geological hazards earthquake<br>statistics and seismic hazard modeling<br>he will also describe some of the<br>exciting new directions he will be<br>taking in the new earthquake science<br>chair a Toto go so please welcome<br>you<br>Chancellor vice-chancellor pro<br>vice-chancellor deputy vice-chancellor<br>head of department James wonderful donor<br>wonderful family jane lewis and toby<br>colleagues friends and very very<br>valuable public thank you very much for<br>coming to hear a little bit about<br>earthquake science the stirling way and<br>these some i've been to a few of these<br>professorial lectures before and<br>everybody does them differently so i'm<br>going to be no exception to that rather<br>than tell you about some really detailed<br>aspect of my career<br>i'm going to give you a once over<br>lightly a whole career and how it all<br>fits together into what i'm doing now<br>so if quakes quaternary faults and<br>seismic hazard in new zealand and beyond<br>that kind of summarizes what I've done<br>and where I am at I'm a someone who<br>never really stuck to one aspect of that<br>science I like multidisciplinary have<br>been in the past called<br>a jack of all trades master of none but<br>as time evolved Jack's of many trades<br>became a specialization in itself so I'm<br>just a introduction here I'm going to<br>show you here my a bit of the timeline<br>and I've done this sort of progress bar<br>at the bottom so you'll know where you<br>are in the talk and it's not the skull<br>because there's some very big time gaps<br>and some of these and some smaller ones<br>than other so early inspiration that's I<br>in my geography geology combined degree<br>at OU Tago in the early 80s GG first<br>real job and this really dates me Dept<br>of lens and survey rather than<br>Department of Conservation<br>eg and that stands for ecological<br>geomorphology MHC honors University of<br>Otago went back after a couple of years<br>tectonic geomorphology TG New Zealand<br>Geological Survey and consulting with<br>Ian Brown associates in Wellington<br>geologic hazards PhD University of<br>nevada-reno<br>seismic hazards and then late 90s to<br>2015 like I say very big timespan and<br>here in the in the progress bar genius<br>science said leader of the National<br>seismic hazard model for three versions<br>of the model in SH M and the present day<br>will talk about this job ever so false<br>earthquake some definitions I'm not<br>going to go very far into this talk<br>without you guys needing to know some<br>definitions now the media are guilty of<br>this and daily conversation of mixing<br>some of these terms so I'm going to set<br>your clear on some of them exit fault<br>there's a lot of different definitions<br>for active box you can see David barrel<br>up in the back there for a really<br>detailed latest definition but it's<br>basically a fault that's likely to<br>produce an earthquake in the future it<br>has in the past met will in the future I<br>won't go into it any any more than that<br>magnitude of the earthquake size tells<br>you nothing about shaking it's the size<br>of the earthquake and there is about a<br>factor of 30 to difference between say a<br>magnitude 5 and a magnitude 6 in terms<br>of the size of the earthquake source now<br>intensity and make sure you get mixed up<br>intensity as a ground motion meter<br>that's some sort of strength of shaking<br>estimate some people say wow you know<br>that was strong what magnitude was it it<br>could have been a small magnitude close<br>or a large magnitude at distance but the<br>intensity the straight strengths of<br>shaking varies hazard and risk this is<br>one of my pet peeves hazard and risk a<br>lot of people including the media user<br>interchange them interchangeably hazard<br>as the natural<br>phenomenon that can have adverse effects<br>on humans like earthquakes volcanoes<br>tsunamis landslides<br>but risk is the measure of what the<br>impact actually is on humans so loss of<br>property loss of life so that's<br>important and here's a little block<br>diagram to show you what a falters<br>before I go any further this is the<br>ground surface here this fault has<br>slipped that one sides gone to the left<br>relative to the other it makes it a left<br>lateral fault these seismic shaking<br>coming out because not just the surface<br>crack is gone but the whole fault plane<br>down to some depth like 15 or 20<br>kilometers is gone and it slipped by<br>some amount of meters so that conjures<br>up image of great sums of energy being<br>released and that's released in the form<br>of seismic shaking and the strength of<br>the shaking as well will depend on what<br>sort of rock types are being displaced<br>hard continental rocks this is soft san<br>andreas fault tight rocks hyper center<br>that's where the earthquake originated<br>in 3d and the epicenter is the surface<br>projection so just some useful<br>definitions and also because we're in<br>New Zealand for those of you who are not<br>familiar with the plate boundary setting<br>of New Zealand it's a lot like<br>California we've got this bigs up that<br>zone going through from one side for the<br>other it's shown as a line here that<br>it's actually about 200 kilometers wide<br>through Marlborough and through the<br>North Island it's quite a complex zone<br>as there's what's called a subduction<br>zone in the north where the Pacific<br>plate goes underneath the Australian<br>plate it's as only you've got<br>strike-slip movement which is horizontal<br>movement like this and uplift through<br>Mowbray and then you've got the Alpine<br>Fault which is doing the same thing<br>horizontal motion and vertical motion<br>causing the uplift of the Southern Alps<br>and more distantly uplift of sea float<br>Argo and Canterbury Rangers and then<br>you've got another subduction zone down<br>in Fiordland where the Australian plate<br>goes under the Pacific plate so this<br>relative motion about 42 millimeters the<br>air through the latitude of about<br>kaikoura wellington Kleier in the south<br>lower and the higher in the north and<br>low in the south so obviously this is a<br>this is a zone where a lot of the slip<br>that doesn't happen gradually that<br>accumulate strain elastically and<br>releases and big earthquakes across the<br>networks of bolts such as the quake or<br>earthquake that I showed you<br>well that I'll show you work on later on<br>and the plate boundary is expressed by<br>lots and lots of the earthquakes lots<br>and lots of active bolt lines and it's<br>part of the Ring of Fire of of<br>earthquakes and volcanoes around the<br>Pacific plate so that's just some useful<br>introduction we're going to now go to<br>our earliest inspiration this is me the<br>little guy not the big guy in the little<br>town of Harry Harry and again I'm<br>showing my age this is the summer of<br>1960 61 I was about seven six months old<br>and you can see that the west coast road<br>is actually a one lane gravel road and<br>and there's the modern car at the time<br>so I'm I'm an old guy and this photo<br>actually look older than it is though<br>because it's an old one that I found and<br>was and I scanned and it's got that so<br>the 19th century look about it I'm not<br>quite that old but there's me looking<br>looking across stuff and I was<br>apparently pointed up at the big<br>mountain and said big tone on the earth<br>and what that translated to according to<br>my parents was big stone on the roof<br>because I was seen these mountains and I<br>was relating it to roofs so I had the<br>knife for the mountains also we lived in<br>the Kapiti Coast and I would point out<br>Kapiti Island and do similar things so I<br>was obviously on to it my folks saw it<br>so in the in the 1970s now jumping<br>forward a bit teenage years I'm not<br>going to show you photos of me then I<br>had long hair I wore Flair's I looked<br>really really bad<br>I was also in the mobile trended Club so<br>you know the tramping I hear is only a<br>term that's used in New Zealand it's<br>hiking hiking or backpacking or whatever<br>I used to do lots of backpacking in the<br>mole berm mountains and I climb most of<br>the mountains and the Richmond Range and<br>I would more than just hike in the area<br>I was always fascinated about the<br>contorted rocks and stuff which is<br>molars just as you will know but I'd<br>also look out over the wire El Valle and<br>I would see the spot line this is the<br>wire our fault<br>and back then at the time Gerald linson<br>of the New Zealand Geological Survey was<br>using site a site on the wire fault to<br>demonstrate for the first time in the<br>world<br>progressive fault offset so big terraces<br>terraces offset a lot a lot and small<br>terraces younger terraces not soft not<br>offset so much so that was the concept<br>of progressive offset by plate motion<br>and by earthquakes this was this is<br>actually the one of the positions of the<br>plate boundary you've got the you've got<br>the Pacific plate here on the south side<br>and the Australian plate here the wire<br>over and the Richmond range and the<br>Richmond range is actually related to<br>the past just but it's been offset large<br>distances along the Alpine Fault so I<br>would see these and think wow I really<br>would like to know more about this and I<br>started thinking about about going on<br>into University and this is a favorite<br>quote of mine if I studied geology I<br>could understand what I was seeing and<br>also get paid to be in the mountains<br>that sounded like a win-win for me so my<br>parents had the sort of stereotypical<br>attitude of you know bless their hearts<br>and all that sort of thing but they<br>wanted me to be one of those noble<br>professions like a doctor or a lawyer<br>and I don't want any of that<br>so they pretty much accepted that's what<br>I was all about so then went in<br>University in 1980 came down here<br>couldn't wait to leave blenheim apart<br>from the mountains that was a pretty<br>redneck sort of a town back in those<br>days I was one of those weedy sort of<br>office types I wasn't a rugby player I<br>wasn't as popular as some of those guys<br>you know so I I was absolutely wrapped<br>to come down to an environment like a<br>target really captured me and through<br>the BSC geography geology degree that I<br>did I I can say that I had got an<br>excellent grounding and broad spectrum<br>geology and geomorphology by combining<br>the combining the strengths of the two<br>departments and you know a lot of<br>hardrock geology in the time Croft<br>Combs's long standing excellent<br>stewardship of the department and then<br>into the geomorphology through the<br>physical geography but really the<br>inspiration that I had came from Doug<br>Campbell he was on set with me on the<br>North Otago field trip my first ever<br>first year field trip which I just code<br>was a sort of a leader a co-leader on<br>the other day and remembered the time<br>when Doug sat beside me and said when<br>you go on to your masters barber barn<br>are we what<br>this is my first week in university and<br>he's talking about a masters but he sort<br>of got that I was quite keen and<br>professor Brockie bill Brockie who these<br>are both unfortunately passed away these<br>gentlemen he was a geomorphologist<br>Scottish geomorphologist and he he and I<br>would talk forever about geomorphology<br>so that was part of it and then field<br>trips to Central Otago this is the<br>Cromwell Gorge before the dam site and<br>Lake Dunstan that absolutely catches me<br>I remember riding through there on my<br>Honda 504 to a field trip second year<br>field trip in 1981 and seeing this<br>amazing area and thought I have to do<br>more work in this area so there actually<br>turned out to be quite a long-term thing<br>after after doing my bachelor's I left<br>and decided to do some work for a couple<br>of years to get some money in and think<br>about what I was going to do and you<br>know into professional life and I worked<br>for the old man ecological district PNA<br>program which was run out of the lands<br>and survey this was an ecological survey<br>a series of pilot ecological surveys<br>that were looking at characterizing<br>these upland areas of Otago and<br>Canterbury in terms of their ecological<br>and geomorphological qualities and the<br>old man<br>Garvey mountains area on this upland<br>area near Alexandra was one of our main<br>areas and I was the one geomorphologists<br>a whole lot of botanists and I had this<br>amazing job of being able to describe<br>all the landforms and sort of<br>characterize them in terms of their<br>quality and quantity and Allen mark and<br>I had some wonderful times together and<br>think about that whole topic area and so<br>this is a picture of the old man range<br>up on the summit while I was doing that<br>I was it was Dunedin base so I was<br>keeping in touch to the geology<br>department and Chuck Landis and Richard<br>Norris were very interested in what I<br>was working on and the types of<br>observations and they could see I was<br>interested in you know not just the<br>ecology that the tectonics Renea<br>tectonics the young tectonics the stuff<br>that's going on now and there's a there<br>was this new emerging field of tectonic<br>geomorphology where you use the<br>landforms to estimate what's going on in<br>terms of plate tectonics in the area and<br>Central Otago having this big ancient<br>penny playing surface was this ideal<br>environment this flat datum the area<br>hadn't been glaciated and so it was<br>something that was was there for the<br>taking in terms of doing doing this new<br>field of tectonic geomorphology<br>so they convinced me to come back and do<br>a masters now in the long term I'm happy<br>to say that this ecological survey which<br>I you know you do these things but you<br>have a certain degree of cynicism that<br>you think it's going to go nowhere and<br>because it's not about oil and it's not<br>about hazards etc but it actually the<br>old man range actually got made into the<br>couple way conservation area and I can<br>recognize the boundaries from the<br>boundaries we drew on those maps so that<br>was one of those sort of little career<br>satisfaction type of things so you know<br>Chuck and Richard convinced me twisted<br>my arm not very hard to go back and<br>study tectonic geomorphology in a<br>hardrock department now there were some<br>some quite you know people were it was<br>great the geology department is a<br>fantastic place people are your friends<br>and your colleagues there was the odd<br>remark from people like Andrew alabone<br>saying what do you want to study dead<br>for study some real rocks you know and<br>so that was the way the department was<br>in those days how things have changed so<br>you know during those two and a half<br>years this is the summary of it what we<br>were what we were recognizing was that<br>the penny plane service this old ancient<br>erosion surface in the shift and here's<br>a picture just from the other day on in<br>North Otago trip and this is a boundary<br>between the shift we've got the shift<br>foliation the layers here dipping at a<br>relatively low angle and it's overlain<br>by these tertiary gravels that were laid<br>down and sometimes tropical conditions<br>on this old ancient land surface and<br>that was a stable period of time at the<br>start of the tertiary period but<br>nowadays you've had the Alpine Fault<br>created and you've got uplift and<br>defamation what has happened is that in<br>Central Otago in the absence of<br>glaciation you've had Rangers uplifted<br>and their smooth top ranges because all<br>the sediments have been stripped off and<br>exposed this old shaft surface so it's<br>like penny plain almost<br>Payne but it's also called an exhumed<br>penny claim so it's this flat surface<br>and this is a plateau between the old<br>man range and the Garvey mountains which<br>was my field area that distance there's<br>about 20 to 30 kilometers and it's<br>exhumed penny plain surface and you have<br>these amazing features on the summit<br>called tours and this is the old man of<br>the old man range it's 26 meters high<br>and these features are remnants of an<br>old erosion surface where there was once<br>with it's just in areas but the land<br>surface was up up there but so what I<br>worked out through claim a neurology and<br>various sedimentary relationships and<br>stuff was that the original plane<br>couldn't have been eroded away by more<br>than tens of meters and one of the<br>things we saw was that there were<br>actually tropical environment clay<br>minerals inside the soil of up in these<br>five up in these 1500 meter high<br>mountains which showed that it was it<br>was a relic surface it was tropical<br>minute clay minerals from this old<br>surface that was once a plane and that<br>showed you that the the PE pain was not<br>greatly modified from its original and<br>that was quite radical because you know<br>you're thinking of it as a cold Alpine<br>environment and yet there's not been<br>much erosion and that's because there's<br>basically been negotiations up there or<br>for deceit erosion by rivers that was<br>quite important for that meant that you<br>could use these Rangers and use the<br>penny plane surface and the low angle<br>relationship with the shift to estimate<br>your total deformation across the area<br>and this is my field area here circled<br>between the old man range and garvey<br>mountains but all these ranges here we<br>could then use the deformation of the<br>penny claim to get the total deformation<br>on these on the causative fault lines<br>underneath and David Beryl is going to<br>be leading a platform study to do that<br>providing we get funding David<br>so the other thing on this good friends<br>and central otago donna pillai and mark<br>heaven Otago alumni they'd only nning<br>Rock vineyard I have a little legacy to<br>be proud of and that they asked me to<br>design their little symbol because I<br>they liked my tour drawings so it's<br>named after one of the biggest tours in<br>Central Otago the next thing in this<br>some journey I again left my masters and<br>when I got a great opportunity in the<br>New Zealand Geological Survey to work on<br>meta Hina active fault investigations<br>now Meza Hina dam is up in the Bay of<br>Plenty 1987 was the Edgecomb earthquake<br>of about a magnitude 6.2 6.3 earthquake<br>but it's significantly damaged Mehta<br>Hina dam and they had to it was an it's<br>an earth dam and they had to do some<br>pretty urgent stabilization work to<br>avoid catastrophic failure of the dam<br>and so mater he know after that it all<br>sorted they decided well we need to<br>understand more about the earthquake<br>hazards in the area and so basically the<br>young the power provider is electrical I<br>think it was then paid for seismic<br>hazard investigations and I got to do<br>working in volt trenches for the first<br>time when you dig trenches across active<br>faults and you date you examine and date<br>the layers and work out the prehistoric<br>earthquakes and so that was my first<br>taste of earthquake geology and it was<br>through Sarah beamland the late Sarah<br>Berlin who got who was an another Otago<br>alumni who got tragically drowned in the<br>90s on a tramping trip in the North<br>Island that Sarah employed me and gave<br>me my first break then during the work<br>during the time of my time with Ian<br>Brown associate so I got to spend the<br>year and a half working on the Cromwell<br>Gorge landslides that was a late<br>age very urgent phase of investigations<br>and remedial work on lens life after the<br>dam is being built when some review<br>process went on and said well you<br>haven't understood these landslides what<br>do you know with any certainty that<br>these landslides are safe because the<br>thought was that if the lake was raised<br>the bottoms of these old ancient<br>landslides would be wet by the by the<br>lake with rising of the water table and<br>there could be catastrophic failure the<br>landslides I worked on were called the<br>brewery Creek landslide and the Canyon<br>landslide and this is the Ken Miller<br>landslide in any of you who've been<br>through the chromel gorge from Clyde to<br>Cromwell will look up and see this crazy<br>construction up on the hill with some<br>some poorly blotted out graffiti that's<br>their hands off Beaumont and a lot of<br>people feared the the dams being<br>developed in the lower closer in the<br>Beaumont area but so this this was done<br>this landslide was one that I worked on<br>and it was a pretty exciting time this<br>was the landslide we which had I forget<br>the numbers but I think there was some<br>it would have accelerated phases of<br>movement and it had what looked like<br>very fresh-looking scarps like some of<br>these clay kora earthquake escapes I'll<br>show you later on and so they had to<br>have Kenya was a very tricky landslide<br>because it didn't sold out down in the<br>lake you'd think that would make it<br>safer but what the people were worried<br>what the experts were worried about was<br>that it was it had these phases of<br>acceleration and deceleration and if it<br>failed it would not it would not come<br>stabilize itself most landslides go from<br>making steep slopes to shallow slopes so<br>they sort of stabilized themselves but<br>what this landslide would do if it got<br>going because it had this bedrock area<br>and up with a perched landslide it could<br>just fall into the lake and caused this<br>massive fish that would overtop the dam<br>and caused a lot of damage so Kenya had<br>lots and lots of it working and putting<br>drives into it tunnels into it to drain<br>the basis of the landslide and the<br>structure was a basically Asheville a<br>series of like roads that were designed<br>to stop the water percolating down into<br>the bottom of the landslide<br>so that was Virginia land so that was<br>pretty exciting time and very formative<br>in terms of career and and good money it<br>actually started our savings for our<br>house even even way before I was married<br>and the last one I won't go into this<br>too in too much detail pitoni Beach<br>Rogers looking at and the geomorphology<br>of the beach ridges old ancient<br>shorelines going up with the tawny belly<br>and looking at their heights in relation<br>to how the Wellington and why Ripper<br>faults the two of the major faults and<br>the Wellington area have interacted with<br>each other<br>raising lowering raising loans we are in<br>a raised time in Wellington at the<br>moment and waiting for the next lowering<br>which causes a nun Dacian and shaping<br>them all those lovely things this<br>picture here is me in that era bed here<br>thinner wearing wearing a and 19th<br>salmon horrible clothes writing a fairly<br>cool but gas guzzling 900 F time the<br>motorcycle with bees all over my fairing<br>that's got on national news one day my<br>boss came in and said your bike is<br>covered with these and he came out with<br>the corniest jokes and I thought year<br>Radian but it really was it really was<br>made to go out there and get interviewed<br>by the media just because my bike was<br>covered in bees swarming load of bees<br>came down and sat in my fairing and and<br>loved the environment and it's<br>apparently appeared in kids books around<br>the world yeah moving on and after five<br>years of working in in in Brown<br>associates oh you know what I should<br>yes Maureen look 17 gns science he was<br>the guy who kept getting on my case and<br>saying you know you you should go and do<br>a PhD you you've got the enthusiasm the<br>drive to be a scientist and not working<br>Consulting and so it would annoy me<br>because I knew I don't want to go back<br>to school I'm enjoying working and money<br>but I I tend to wait till five o'clock<br>at work and then start writing papers<br>about beat triggers and stuff so it was<br>obvious I was a scientist trapped in a<br>consulting job and Marino knew that and<br>he kept on my case until I eventually<br>went off to the States got a good<br>opportunity at the University of<br>nevada-reno which is my silver and blue<br>colors on my robes and so this was five<br>years I'm just going to give some<br>highlights from this because here you do<br>a lot of work and and American PhD in<br>terms of exams and and qualifiers and<br>papers there were five papers but the<br>highlight the gutenberg-richter and<br>characteristic earthquake model address<br>these two problems this was something<br>that my PhD supervisor Steve was nasty<br>had worked on showing that most faults<br>most fault lines have this distribution<br>this is the earthquake frequency<br>distribution what I'm showing here it's<br>a graph that gives you the number of<br>earthquakes per year greater than or<br>equal to some level of magnitude so<br>think of that as a brace of the<br>earthquakes and this is the magnitude of<br>earthquakes so small earthquakes going<br>to big earthquakes what you normally see<br>on faults is is this population of<br>smaller earthquakes then a big step out<br>to the population of the biggest<br>earthquakes and what this does is it's<br>like say the Alpine Fault where things<br>sit around very quietly just bits and<br>bits of earthquakes here and there and<br>suddenly Wham you've got your major<br>earthquakes then you get to master shops<br>and then it quiets down again that's<br>what this characteristic distribution is<br>all about most and then the<br>gutenberg-richter is this one where if<br>you put all the seismicity of the world<br>together or<br>vielen together or anything you usually<br>get this sort of fractal distribution<br>now I should say that logs go there and<br>magnitudes already a log scale as you<br>know the Gutenberg director has this log<br>linear relationship and there were some<br>seismologists that said all faults<br>should be gutenberg-richter because of<br>the worldís and the fault should be a<br>subset of the world and there were some<br>folks that did show this behavior but<br>very few what Stephen I did was really<br>to show that there was actually a<br>systematic relationship between these<br>distributions and what the faults looked<br>like and what they're done and this is a<br>fault line think of this as a fault line<br>here on the ground you're looking down<br>from it from a plane or a forest drone<br>or something like that and the seed<br>minted faults the ones that had all<br>these breaks in their traces so quite<br>complex faults tended to have small<br>amounts of total ops offset and this is<br>the total geologic offset on the fault<br>so this is some geological layer here<br>that's been broken and offset to the<br>left those distributions tended to show<br>gutenberg-richter distributions but then<br>the smoother traces like the fen Andreas<br>Fault in the Alpine Falls and hope<br>faulting those tended to have much<br>longer offsets exist they'd been this<br>process that had gone on there as the<br>fault had accumulated offset it had<br>ironed out all its rough spots and<br>became a smooth fault race so more<br>mature less complex fault<br>and those showed the characteristic<br>distribution and it's possibly in terms<br>of the earthquake physics this is<br>possibly the case that as you get a<br>smoother trace you've got less and less<br>hit stressed heterogeneity on the fault<br>and so you have less need for the<br>smaller earthquakes and that was that<br>was a model that we published it was a<br>it was murder publishing it my<br>supervisor Steve was a perfectionist and<br>speaking and writing and I had many<br>period times thinking am I ever going to<br>get through this thanks again Jane<br>and because he was such a stickler for<br>the for the English writing and speaking<br>but I really learned a lot from him and<br>we're great mates now and for that Steve<br>was now ski he was an imposing guy of<br>six foot five with piercing blue eyes so<br>you didn't want to get in get him angry<br>with you but then the other guys here<br>Jim Brune he was he's one of the great<br>fathers of seismology in modern times he<br>was on my committee John Anderson and<br>these three are from where Columbia<br>University of New York grads and we<br>referred to them as the Lamont mafia and<br>Russell the new support who was a<br>colleague but he and I worked together a<br>loss and I learned a lot from him and<br>another part of the some story was<br>earthquake statistics and seismic<br>heathered that the maps that came out of<br>my work when I put it all together<br>towards the tail end of my PhD were the<br>first nationwide multidisciplinary<br>seismic hazard maps for New Zealand they<br>look pretty ugly right now but what what<br>this had that the previous maps like<br>these didn't have his fault line as<br>earthquake forces so this is a this is a<br>hazard map this is the year 500 year<br>intensity measures the shaking levels<br>around and it's based on our relatively<br>short historical record at this time<br>about a hundred and fifty years or<br>something like that whereas with a<br>hundred and fifty faults and they're all<br>sampling prehistoric earthquakes so<br>going back in time beyond 1840 we had<br>this very different pattern of hazard<br>where the plate boundary features all<br>started showing quite high hazard the<br>darker the color the higher the hazard<br>and these are both maps they're called<br>probabilistic seismic hazard maps in<br>that they show the ground motions you<br>would expect with a 500 year return<br>period or a 10% probability of happening<br>in 50 years and so that's so those are<br>just examples so these new maps this new<br>map this is the first version I came to<br>gns it automatically<br>Maps became the new the new seismic<br>hazard maps for New Zealand the first<br>version of the new generation and they<br>transformed New Zealand seismic hazard<br>scape so that was basically right place<br>at right time for me in Korea to have a<br>big big impact so on the topic of<br>transformation living in the USA Jane<br>and I found aspects of the USA culture<br>is simply transformational we'd lived<br>the quite life in Wellington and we made<br>a great choice to go over to the states<br>and and mix with the right sort of<br>people and be in an area where there was<br>these amazing things going on like the<br>Burning Man festival out in the desert a<br>desert playa the size of Cook Strait<br>perfectly flat could drive at 80 miles<br>an hour in those days with your eyes<br>closed for a minute it's quite something<br>to do as a deer and and in 2004 I<br>founded the Kiwi burn the New Zealand<br>chapter of Burning Man<br>so that suspends the official New<br>Zealand the official New Zealand<br>regional of Burning Man<br>there's regionals now all around will<br>that we were the first international<br>regional so if net so moving back to<br>serious things moving back to to New<br>Zealand got a job at gns science and led<br>to two more versions of the National<br>seismic hazard model these are just maps<br>of one possible map out of many out of<br>the model you calculate your hazard for<br>500 years<br>you get hazard like this you calculate<br>it for two-and-a-half thousand years<br>which is two percent probability in 50<br>years which is what you would use for<br>hospitals and and schools and sensitive<br>structures the hazard would be much<br>higher it's a dynamic model at the<br>probabilistic model these models changed<br>with accumulation of data and and the<br>2002 model went into the loading<br>standards and New Zealand loading<br>standards that call it the building code<br>if you like so the the legacy that still<br>stands for<br>this early model 2003 model is the the<br>levels of design that your buildings all<br>have so now moving up to the present day<br>and there's a lot of overlap with some<br>of my genius work here oh you know what<br>I should mention definitely Kelvin<br>Berryman he's the guy that I've<br>essentially hired me there was a<br>committee and stuff that Kelvin was the<br>man he said this is this is the this job<br>we need a person to do this and he they<br>could only offer $400 of funded time and<br>and they were all the bean counters were<br>very worried about and Kelvin held his<br>hand on his heart and said believe me<br>when you get the guy and have this<br>position where it will come and it came<br>in droves<br>so tell v'n he's a great guy he's been a<br>mentor and a good friend he's the one<br>guy I'd mention if I mentioned anyone<br>from that era of my like time and genius<br>so ongoing research exotic examples what<br>I got really interested in is when you<br>develop these seismic hazard models how<br>do you ground truth them usually we just<br>make these estimates and and a lot of<br>them are dominated by mathematical<br>distributions we've got very big<br>uncertainties particularly in the ground<br>motion space and you get miles away from<br>reality and so what I've what I've been<br>working on is is kind of thinking<br>outside of seismology seismic hesitant<br>and trying to see how geomorphology<br>might be able to constrain what's going<br>going on and a case point in point the<br>Clyde dam we've had many years of<br>investigations of the seismic for the<br>seismic hazard update of Clyde the dam<br>site that situated at the mouth at in<br>the Luthor catchment if the Dunstan bolt<br>big fault line goes goes through near<br>quite close to the dam<br>and but fortuitously there's these very<br>fragile ancient features that we call<br>fragile geologic features that are quite<br>close to the dam and if you know how old<br>these features are and what it would<br>shake take to shake them down they can<br>give you an idea of what has not<br>happened in that area because if you had<br>an earthquake strong enough to shake<br>those features down and the time they've<br>been sitting like that then they<br>wouldn't be there and so if you can find<br>enough of these features and look at the<br>uncertainties as you always have to do<br>in science you could you can sort of<br>provide some sort of a constraint on on<br>your hazard assessment which is<br>basically a very elaborate mathematical<br>model and so that in essence what I'm<br>showing here is an example of one of the<br>uses of these preterius landforms to<br>compare and test<br>hether calculations and so these rocks<br>are quite ancient features as we found<br>through cosmogenic dating I've worked a<br>lot with David Beryl on this there in<br>the sort of tens of thousands of years<br>so they've been through lots of major<br>really close by earthquakes on the<br>dunstan fault<br>and what you find is these Heaven curves<br>that what these hazard curves are<br>showing you're getting the rate of<br>exceedance of ground motion levels from<br>plotting peak ground acceleration here<br>and so as you go to lower and lower<br>rates or longer and longer return<br>periods or time periods you'll get<br>higher and higher hazard because the<br>rare earthquakes happen down in the<br>space you know every ten thousand years<br>or something what these rocks what we've<br>done here is is plot the age of the<br>rocks on these diagrams and the shaking<br>that would shake them down so therefore<br>they're plotting and showing this<br>population here so anything in these<br>hazard curves to the right are basically<br>the ground motions are too strong for<br>the survival of those rocks so you can<br>actually kind of eliminate your heaven<br>curves out here because they're<br>producing ground<br>that are much too high for the survival<br>of the rocks so we're starting to use<br>these in actual industry to constrain<br>hazards and we're working through Clyde<br>at the moment and I've shown norm<br>Abrahamson here who is a close colleague<br>and he was one of them first of the<br>engineering seismologists with influence<br>and with the foresight to say you've got<br>to start using these speeches to the<br>clients and I was very reluctant to do<br>it in the New Zealand environment<br>there's a great feel more skepticism of<br>this kind of thing in New Zealand and in<br>the u.s. it may be justice but that<br>people were exposed to it longer there<br>but nowadays I've got great people like<br>David Beryl and Russell Anderson and<br>others along for the ride and they they<br>seem to be giving me the thumbs up<br>testing and evaluation of Hazard<br>assistance to the nuclear facilities one<br>of the fascinating aspects of my job<br>going to some of these weird places with<br>nuclear power plants and doing the same<br>sort of thing finding these fragile<br>features because like hydro dams they<br>use they're interested in low<br>probability very strong ground motions<br>like the one in ten thousand year event<br>and those are rare and the numbers are<br>very very high<br>ten thousand year or annual probability<br>of one and ten thousand is what's used<br>for big dams and for nuclear power parks<br>and even even we're so in the case of<br>Yucca Mountain which was for the u.s. is<br>former proposed high-level waste nuclear<br>waste repository and Southern Nevada so<br>these places are going through<br>evaluations of their power time and it's<br>in the case of Diablo Canyon we're using<br>precarious rocks and getting the age and<br>what it would take to shake them down<br>because being in coastal California it's<br>an area of quite high hazard and next<br>week I'm doing some evaluation work at<br>the iCard nuclear power plant in Japan<br>same sort of thing so and I say that<br>their bizarre areas<br>that weird contrails the experimental<br>aircraft getting a tour around the<br>Nevada Test Site and seeing the nuclear<br>blast craters what a fascinating place<br>and daya blue Canyon zoomed in here a<br>massive machine gun tower that's<br>designed to shoot down airplanes for the<br>Veen used as missiles with binoculars<br>and guns looking at us the whole time<br>while we pontificate on precarious rocks<br>bringing us up to the present time again<br>in the last couple of in the last year<br>it's been a fantastic year one<br>highlights and projects paleo seismology<br>of back Ettore folders it's my student<br>Briar Taylor Silver's master's thesis<br>the yakitori folds is quite close to<br>Dunedin it's probably a significant it<br>is a significant seismic hazard elements<br>for Dunedin we've been doing paleo<br>seismology digging trenches across the<br>fault and this is a really beautiful<br>trench site where we've got the fault<br>offsetting this is just basement Rock<br>the oldest rock in the area over<br>thrusting very very geologically young<br>sediments and weave in this particular<br>trench we found three earthquakes in the<br>last 10,000 years and two earthquakes<br>between 1300 and about 750 years ago so<br>it's it's a fault that's been quiet<br>probably for a long time and now it's<br>got itself active and we hope that it in<br>this period of time it did its business<br>and it's now going to be quiet again<br>from many many millennia and<br>acknowledgments to David Beryl and<br>Nicola Litchfield who have worked with<br>us on this and got me back into paleo<br>seismology after a very long break<br>ground motion simulations and validation<br>I'm working in the earthquake science<br>area I'm trying to make cover as broad a<br>range as possible within the<br>capabilities of myself and and others<br>and the ground motion simulations this<br>is where you actually make artificial<br>seismograms<br>at sites like dem sites or whatever from<br>bolt and and so it's it's<br>physics-based seismic hazard it's new<br>territory and what I'm doing is trying<br>to go a little bit further with this and<br>this is the work of Elliot bow a very<br>very good student as well as Breyer<br>using preterius rocks at sites to test<br>these seismograms because of this fault<br>produces squiggles that are these the<br>size of the squiggles the strength of<br>the shaping if they're too high for the<br>survival of these rocks then they've got<br>then there's got to be something wrong<br>and so we're using these rocks to<br>validate these simulations which is<br>taking a new topic further and the<br>defamation model for southern New<br>Zealand this is an area I'm quite<br>interested in working on this is looking<br>at at I mean often in seismic hazard<br>we'll look we'll use the average<br>long-term rate of occurrence of the<br>earthquakes<br>through time as their hazard estimates<br>but what we're finding with some of<br>these faults is that some of them are<br>strongly a periodic in that they have<br>oodles of time very quiet and then they<br>had phases of activity like the a Kotori<br>Falls as I was telling you about and<br>these some of these other faults or<br>faults that have have developing or<br>developed quite reasonable earthquake<br>records that we can look at these sorts<br>of behaviors around the region and the<br>great stretchered Norris he was the guy<br>who initially suggested the idea that<br>across the Otago region for this cross<br>section here goes from the Alpine Fault<br>through to about Dunedin is all these<br>reverse faults and they sold out on a<br>day Coleman and that the activity shifts<br>literally around and maybe at the moment<br>it's over in the a Kotori so it's like a<br>back thrust off the Alpine Fault and so<br>that's something that we're looking at<br>and why on earth do I have a model of a<br>map of Australia there I was at I was in<br>Australia recently for a update workshop<br>on their national seismic hazard net and<br>fault a periodicity is something that<br>their faults seem to show and that we're<br>this is the last of the topics you can<br>see that the bars now will read the<br>clock or earthquakes<br>David Beryl and I are pretty quickly<br>formed a note our go team that met on<br>the handily fault<br>in the kaikoura ruptures briefly the<br>kaikoura earthquake magnitude 7.8 and<br>november last year<br>ruptured over a period of two minutes<br>this conflict zone that started around<br>the town of whale up to very very close<br>to one of our major faults the hope<br>fault down the stone jug Foulke ole it<br>lists all the names the humps fault the<br>leader fault the char will conway fault<br>the stone jug fault<br>the hand early fault which we were<br>looking at the forget the name of that<br>one point keen fault puppeteer fault<br>Kawai jordan thrust kick renew and<br>needles fault 180 kilometers long zone<br>of complex rupture ignoring major faults<br>in places from Southwest to Northeast in<br>terms of ground motions of authority an<br>area of high hazard in this in the<br>seismic hazard modeling and we had some<br>complex ruptures defined in the model<br>but not as complex as this one so<br>there's some considerable learning there<br>but I would call it a career highlight<br>to be netting a rupture while you're<br>feeling aftershocks and while the free<br>faces are crumbling it's very active and<br>you can see the excitement and graces<br>so this is my last slide an important<br>one again thank you very much for<br>everyone who helped me have a great life<br>and the donors for the position<br>obviously my family and I didn't mention<br>earlier the high school geography<br>teacher that said you'll go places boy<br>and Chuck Landis Pritchard Norris etc my<br>Reno colleagues Kelvin Berryman and<br>Maureen 70s rec subs in there as Vice<br>Chancellor mentioned he's a great guy<br>but I also wanted to mention Sonya<br>pecheur here who is the university's<br>academic recruitment person and she was<br>the one who convinced me to apply for<br>the otago job it seems like what that<br>would be a no-brainer to apply for a<br>wonderful job like this but after<br>working in the industry as long as I had<br>I thought no they're not even going to<br>look at me being a non-academic person<br>and she said no no you've got stuff that<br>they'll be interested in so she she<br>encouraged me and she turned out to be a<br>great friend and that she's a wonderful<br>person so I owe her a lot and I keep<br>telling her that but she she says don't<br>worry about it but I do<br>anyway and near his my here's my great<br>family and only my held off he hits a<br>block sorry don't print that so thank<br>you very much everybody<br>thanks so much mark for that that the<br>inspiring talk really enjoyed seeing how<br>you came to be where you are from from<br>the early days to to the not not quite<br>so early days and excitement of the<br>recent earthquakes and realized that<br>when I was looking at your slides I<br>didn't didn't see the caption so I<br>didn't know you had actually brought<br>Burning Man here so that's good and I<br>certainly hadn't known about that that<br>motorcycle ride that sounds alright<br>without further ado I think I'll just<br>say thank you very much for that talk<br>really enjoyed it and we have a small<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
