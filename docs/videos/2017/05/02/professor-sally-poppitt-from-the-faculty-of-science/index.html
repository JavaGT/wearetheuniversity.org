font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is Professor Sally puppet and<br>I'm a chair in human nutrition at the<br>University of Auckland and I'm also the<br>director of the human nutrition unit a<br>collaboration between two factors at the<br>University of Auckland in Department of<br>Medicine and the School of Biological<br>Sciences the human nutrition Yin is<br>residential long stay intervention unit<br>and one of the most important things<br>about the unit is that we can control<br>all of the food that a participant needs<br>whether we need to manipulate a micro<br>nutrients or micronutrients a whole meal<br>a diet dietary trials are about a lot<br>more than just diet and we're interested<br>in the relationship between the food and<br>your health we are particularly<br>interested in weights management's and<br>overweight and obesity and we think of<br>it really in two different ways the<br>first way is around the causes of<br>obesity why do a lot of people struggle<br>with their weight and secondly we're<br>very interested in the consequences so<br>if somebody becomes overweight there's a<br>number of diseases that will increased<br>risk particularly type 2 diabetes in<br>terms of some of the causes of obesity<br>ourselves here at the unit and also many<br>researchers worldwide believe that<br>probably the most important thing in<br>terms of major driver of weight gain is<br>outside and appetite control how hungry<br>you feel powerful do you feel how much<br>would you like to eat what sort of foods<br>do you choose to eat is there a<br>relationship between your genes and your<br>diet and also your environment we're<br>particularly interested in the dietary<br>aspect our appetite trials are some of<br>the most interesting things that we do<br>and to do those we ask participants to<br>come to the unit and go into one of our<br>booth rooms while the participants in<br>the<br>they're concentrating just completely on<br>each ammonia and we're interested to<br>know when we serve some DML in the booth<br>are they feeling hungry are they feeling<br>full how much from the meal that they<br>like to eat when would they like to<br>request another meal some of our very<br>interesting trials recently have been<br>around trying to target different areas<br>of the girl with different nutrients to<br>see whether stimulating pieces of the<br>gut can make you feel full one of my PhD<br>students Jim sanction did a really<br>interesting study where he asked<br>participants to come and stay here for<br>five days and we introduced an<br>incredibly long tube a three metre long<br>tube down through the nose down into the<br>stomach and down all the way through the<br>intestines right to the very far end of<br>the small intestine and then infused<br>nutrients down the tube and we showed<br>when we did that that if you put<br>carbohydrates into that far end of the<br>small intestine so very specific part of<br>the gut that you can induce Society if<br>you can determine which parts of the<br>guitar really important in terms of what<br>to stimulate then potentially you can<br>target that with a food you might um<br>take a particular nutrient and put a<br>very clever encapsulation method around<br>it so that you could take the nutrient<br>would travel all the way down doesn't<br>need the tube goes down on its own and<br>when it gets to this piece of the gut it<br>could be a timed release and that may<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
