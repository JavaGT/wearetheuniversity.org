Felicia Moyse I work at<br>me Armas my second thesis<br>I'm a consumer behaviorist and I<br>specialize in transformative consumer<br>behavior so this means changing the way<br>that consumers behave often in quite<br>significant ways so it can be used for<br>commercial purposes such as introducing<br>a new brand and encouraging consumers to<br>try the new brands and interested in the<br>kinds of sensory fonts that would<br>encourage consumers to tie the brand or<br>it can be used for more social marketing<br>purposes such as encouraging people to<br>wear seatbelts and vehicles I'm really<br>interested in encouraging consumers to<br>make healthier food choices I'm<br>particularly interested in children and<br>adolescents adolescents as they<br>transition into adulthood and making<br>their own twist for good nutrition for<br>life supermarkets are our lifelines they<br>are where we go to shop and for most of<br>us it's us weak supermarkets have a<br>responsibility to ensure that there's<br>adequate nutrition available in them and<br>of course they do an excellent job most<br>of them with the fruit and vegetable<br>aisle and the food produce such as the<br>me so you walk into a supermarket one of<br>the first things you notice is that<br>there's very rarely any natural lighting<br>this is to encourage you to stay longer<br>because you are not aware of the passing<br>of time the first thing we see in any<br>supermarket is usually the fresh product<br>the fruit and vegetables the beautiful<br>colors stimulate our senses and<br>encourage us to buy and here we have the<br>soft drink equally colorful just like<br>the fruit and veg but not nearly as good<br>for us the range in huge and the sizes<br>of bottles are quite significant in<br>terms of how little they cost for the<br>volume that can<br>we get the other aspect that I'm very<br>interested in is food labeling this is<br>where we give lots of information on<br>what is in our food and I'm interested<br>in how people as consumers learn to read<br>these labels how do they decide what is<br>really important and how do they decide<br>to accept or reject a food people are<br>becoming much more wellness aware in<br>terms of marketing we're starting to see<br>lots of different products being<br>marketed as providing wellness benefits<br>wellness commune different things to<br>different people<br>and to different demographics in any<br>society were a young family they may be<br>focused on they're very young children<br>and making sure that they are getting<br>enough nutrients for cognitive<br>development and for healthy bone growth<br>for older citizens it may be about<br>cognitive health in a different way may<br>be about maintaining our cognitive<br>health also Mozilla tea could be<br>wellness so making sure that we can<br>still move and that we've got good<br>muscle growth and good sustainment<br>muscles<br>many businesses are actually starting to<br>come to market with products that will<br>satisfy consumers need they're adding<br>value to things like yogurts<br>with the addition of probiotics and<br>those are selling extremely well my role<br>is to determine whether this would be<br>acceptable to a consumer and if it would<br>be acceptable how to then package it for<br>the consumer so that the consumer<br>understands what is actually available<br>and the benefits that they will get in<br>consuming this project the important<br>thing is to get to know the consumer to<br>really really understand the consumer<br>and their needs<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
