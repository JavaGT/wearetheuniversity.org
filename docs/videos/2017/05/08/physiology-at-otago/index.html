Discover Physiology at the University of Otago.<br><br>http://www.otago.ac.nz/physiology<br><br>Physiology is the study of how our bodies work at the molecular, cellular, and organ systems levels. Understanding human physiology is therefore a key part of knowing ourselves. And of course, knowing what's normal is crucial to understanding the abnormalities that lead to disease, and enabling development of effective treatments.<br><br>A university-level understanding of how the body works is an excellent preparation for a wide range of career options. Some Physiology graduates go on to higher degrees in Physiology because they wish to become full-time researchers and academics, designing their own research and leading research teams.<br><br>Other graduates use their Physiology degrees to gain access to a wide range of jobs where employers are looking for specific knowledge of human biology, including as laboratory research technicians, advisors to TV and movie productions, in medical technology companies, aviation and space medicine research, hospital sleep laboratories, and marketing pharmaceuticals — to name just a few.<br><br>If you find human biology interesting and want to know more about how the human body works — or why it sometimes fails to work properly — then Physiology is for you.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the basic curiosity questions how does a<br>heart work how do the lungs work how do<br>the muscles work and in my case how does<br>the brain work is essentially a<br>physiological question I got into<br>physiology by accident basically and<br>discovered that physiology was what I'd<br>always liked at school but they don't<br>tell you it's physiology they just cover<br>it with its biology and you do this and<br>that and that we question within<br>physiology how we are who we are<br>physiology is all about you it explains<br>how you work from the whole body down to<br>the cellular level while similar to<br>Anatomy which studies the form of living<br>systems physiology studies their<br>function and I found that really<br>interesting to see how you know not<br>necessarily what we made up of but how<br>it works the yearly Hands-On Science<br>Program gives many high school students<br>students their first taste of physiology<br>at Oto I was a bit unsure at first I<br>wasn't quite sure what I was getting<br>myself into but it's been an amazing<br>experience um I like the ECG monitor cuz<br>it was really interesting I've seen it<br>on programs like er and stuff but I've<br>never really understood kind of how it<br>works so how you meant to use it I was<br>looking at specializing in kidney<br>function I've had a kidney condition<br>since I was three and I've been in and<br>out Hospital a lot and I know blood<br>pressure is quite a big part when you<br>have kidney disease so that was really<br>interesting rather than just a nurse or<br>a doctor taking your blood pressure to<br>actually understand why they do it what<br>it affects and how they do it that<br>amazing sense of Discovery continues to<br>excite students as they journey through<br>our undergraduate and post-graduate<br>programs well I think one of the things<br>I really like about physiology is that<br>you're always learning about yourself<br>you know whether it's learning about how<br>your muscles work or learning about how<br>your heart or your lungs you know it's<br>it's very much close to home and the<br>other things I really enjoy is the<br>experiments the experiments of<br>physiology are<br>fantastic we work a lot with animal<br>tissue so we've worked with parts of<br>intestines of rabbits and mice which is<br>really cool things you don't get to do<br>in<br>school I just like how it's broad so you<br>learn about all parts of the body and<br>it's applicable to everyday life so it's<br>quite interesting everything you do<br>there's like a basis for it in<br>physiology where you're eating your<br>lunch going for a run and it's just kind<br>of cool to have a big pitch<br>understanding and be able to kind of<br>work it all together with physiology I<br>founded most easy to grasp compared to<br>other papers and I found it more<br>interesting and to me it makes it makes<br>sense studying physiology is relevant to<br>everyday life because there is still so<br>much that we don't know about ourselves<br>the need to be better informed motivates<br>Innovative research and teaching alike<br>here in the 300 level we do research<br>Based Teaching which also means you are<br>at the limits of what is<br>known understanding the scientific<br>questions of today today means you're<br>making a real difference to life<br>tomorrow it's very rewarding to be able<br>to do something like that you know to be<br>able to see the impact of your health<br>lives our internationally recognized<br>research falls into three broad areas<br>cellular and molecular<br>Neuroscience they study how the brain<br>regulates things like muscle movement<br>and<br>fertility cardiovascular and respiratory<br>physiology<br>they look at how your heart and lungs<br>are affected by things like exercise or<br>diabetes membrane physiology and ion<br>transport they investigate how molecules<br>move across membranes like during<br>digestion in the gut or water loss in<br>the<br>kidney my job is my hobby okay so I'm<br>doing what I enjoy what what inspires me<br>what excites me is what I come to work<br>for research that's what interests me<br>it's very diverse the research is what<br>really drives me every day to come into<br>the office get into the lab and see what<br>we're going to find today it's a job<br>where you never stop learning yourself<br>every day you learn something new the<br>passion skill and commitment of our<br>staff not only leads to life-changing<br>discoveries it also creates a fantastic<br>place to work and learn I really like<br>the aspect that I'm not sitting here all<br>day alone in my office but that I do<br>that with a team of students and also<br>with a team of of colleagues I love<br>working here at atago I think it's a<br>very supportive environment we have a<br>very active research group that<br>collaborate and talk about<br>ideas in physiology everyone's helpful<br>everyone's supportive and if you need<br>anything they always there all of this<br>can be found here in the physiology<br>department at otago University located<br>at the Heart of the student-oriented<br>City of denen I decided to come down to<br>ATO because I wanted to be more<br>independent I just wanted to to<br>experience that lifestyle just get out<br>there do your thing it's amazing it's<br>such a cool city with the layout I've<br>been told it's a real student City but I<br>kind of didn't understand what that<br>really meant till I got down here I'm<br>looking forward to coming down here to<br>UNI and making lifelong friends and<br>relationships here at otago physiology<br>is all about you your study your city<br>your lifestyle<br>phology It's All About<br>Me</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
