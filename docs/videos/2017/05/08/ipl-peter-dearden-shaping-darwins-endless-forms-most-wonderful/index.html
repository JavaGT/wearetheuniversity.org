and guitar would<br>appeal Manoa ro rocket Adama tena koe tu<br>tena koe tow canna Tata katoa good<br>evening my name is Harlan hain and I<br>have the great privilege of being the<br>vice chancellor here at the University<br>of Otago and it is my great pleasure to<br>welcome you on behalf of the University<br>to this inaugural professorial lecture<br>for Peter Deardon now I'd like to extend<br>a particularly warm welcome to the<br>members of the wider community who are<br>joining us this evening and including<br>Peter's family who I suspect are quite<br>rightly here with a huge sense of pride<br>in particular I'd like to acknowledge<br>his wife Petra his three children<br>Victoria William and Elizabeth his<br>father emeritus professor Chris Deardon<br>and his mother Monica now like all of<br>our promotions Peters promotion has come<br>on the back of years and years of hard<br>work and scholarship in order to achieve<br>promotion to this rank an individual<br>must demonstrate excellence in teaching<br>in research and in service to the<br>University and the wider community and<br>Peter is absolutely no exception to this<br>rule he has certainly excelled across<br>all three of these categories in terms<br>of research peter has an impressive<br>publication history on developmental<br>plasticity and epigenetics his work on<br>honeybees in particular has been<br>supported by a long string of extramural<br>research grants and for work at the<br>interface with industry in terms of<br>teaching Peter is a popular classroom<br>teacher and a popular research<br>supervisor and I understand that a large<br>number of his research contingent are<br>here this evening to support him but<br>among all his strengths perhaps Peter's<br>greatest strength is his ability to<br>translate complex science into language<br>that captures the imagination of the<br>general public over the years he has led<br>a number of highly successive successful<br>community projects through his work at<br>genetics at Otago gravity' hands on<br>science and most recently with lab in a<br>box his efforts in this era<br>had been rewarded with the Callahan<br>Medal for excellence in science<br>communication from the Royal Society of<br>New Zealand but for me personally Peters<br>greatest strength is his enthusiasm for<br>everything that he does<br>now although good attitude is not a<br>promotion criterion although perhaps it<br>should be<br>Peters generous and affable manner means<br>that working with him is always a<br>pleasure it also means that when he<br>pushes the boundaries which he does<br>frequently in his career the university<br>is more likely to turned a blind eye and<br>allow him to carry on now we've just<br>completed the professorial promotion<br>round for 2017 and it was a poignant<br>reminder for me about exactly how<br>difficult it is to be promoted to<br>professor here at Otago now not only do<br>we apply our own extremely high<br>standards but we also seek the views of<br>internationally recognized experts in<br>the candidates area of research<br>expertise now when we sought this kind<br>of input regarding the merits of Peters<br>promotion we heard things like the first<br>time I heard him speak at an academic<br>conference I was stunned by the quality<br>of the research presentation I heard<br>that day both in terms of the elegance<br>of the Drosophila and honeybee research<br>presented and the eloquence of the<br>speaker<br>we also heard Peter Deardon is an<br>extraordinary academic and his most work<br>most worthy of the promotion simply put<br>Peter is an outstanding and creative<br>scientist who is without doubt a leader<br>in his research field and finally the<br>University of Otago is very fortunate to<br>have him on the faculty well Peter I<br>couldn't agree more I have always been<br>happy to have you as a colleague and I<br>would like to congratulate you on behalf<br>of the wider University for your very<br>well earned promotion to Professor I<br>will now call on professor Vernon ward<br>who is the Dean of the school of<br>biomedical sciences to tell us a little<br>bit more about Peters journey to<br>Professor narada tena koe Jo tena koe tu<br>thank you first Chancellor tena koe<br>toccata me no Ethan a Kyoto welcome<br>everybody<br>I have the very pleasurable task of<br>introducing professor peter Deardon to<br>you this evening and getting to<br>introduce people for the inaugural<br>professorial lecture as one of the<br>pleasures of the job and it's always<br>nice to watch the reaction as they sit<br>and wonder what I'm actually going to<br>introduce always a little bit nervous<br>for them so one of the good things I get<br>to do is to look at the journey somebody<br>has taken to get to be professor and<br>it's always a fascinating journey<br>Peter's interests have been in the area<br>of genetics pretty much from his early<br>days he undertook his undergraduate and<br>honours degree at Victoria University in<br>the early 1990s and then he moved on to<br>undertake his PhD at Imperial College in<br>London he followed that with two<br>postdoctoral positions and zoology<br>departments one in Cambridge University<br>and one at the University of Western<br>Ontario even came to Otago in 2001 as a<br>research fellow and very quickly moved<br>on to the elektra senior lecturer<br>associate professor and 15 years later<br>is now professor at this University and<br>very deservedly on the way throughout<br>that time peter has maintained his<br>interest in all things genetics<br>especially as that relates to evolution<br>of the animal form one area that I'm<br>also going to emphasize following on<br>from the Vice Chancellors comments is<br>it's very fitting tonight to recognize<br>Peters commitment to science leadership<br>and his commitment to science<br>communication and I trying to think of<br>what's the best way of illustrating this<br>and so I thought I'd just read a few of<br>the awards and recognitions that Peter<br>has received during his journey the<br>Callaghan medal has already mentioned<br>the Ross Crozier medal from the Genetics<br>Society of Australia<br>he's been deputy director of gravida a<br>center of research excellence is on the<br>otago museum trust board he's been vice<br>president of the Otago Institute he's<br>the director of genetics our target was<br>just been renewed he's on the Ministry<br>of business innovation employment<br>science and society reference group the<br>science Media Centre advisory board for<br>the Royal Society of New Zealand he's<br>won the row his trust and car<br>Smith medal in this university the<br>inaugural convener of the ozone group<br>and perhaps most unjustly I think as the<br>lab in a box so when I like I think it's<br>brilliant and I could keep on going but<br>least that long again and then I said no<br>I'm saying well had I also show what<br>Peters commitment to communication has<br>been and I added up and looked at what<br>he's done this year<br>46 media presentations commentaries<br>articles and the popular press on radio<br>TV that sort of thing he's genuinely<br>committed to it of course to be a<br>professor you have to have some decent<br>research to underpin the communication<br>and he does<br>it's got 66 publications and journals<br>such as nature Nature communications<br>PNAS and I noticed quite certainly a lot<br>of his publications have come out and<br>things like the public library of<br>science and biomed central stables of<br>journals which open access fits very<br>much with what Peter's emphasis is on<br>he's been funded by Marsden MB cause<br>HRC's international funds and many other<br>places as well I haven't covered as<br>teaching its stellar and you're about to<br>see that and that's my segue to saying<br>what you go to here tonight this is<br>presentation on shaping Darwin's endless<br>forms most wonderful what you'll see is<br>Peters career long interest in genetics<br>its fascination of how genes and<br>processes influence the evolution of<br>animals and how this world has ended up<br>with such a broad wide and diverse<br>collection of living entities that's as<br>interest but he also does as he goes on<br>and thanks fundamental knowledge and<br>applies it whether that's getting a<br>better be or whether that's the<br>controlling of the pesky insect that's a<br>series of interesting he applies it so<br>there's a no pressure build-up there<br>Peter the now like to invite you to come<br>forth and present your hood inaugural<br>professorial lecture larae latina to<br>Medicare Qatar Qatar tena koe Tina Tina<br>Toa<br>hi hello I was sitting there thinking<br>how this guy sounds good it's gonna be<br>an awesome talk and then disappointingly<br>at me and hello<br>my name's Peter so thank you so much for<br>such a eloquent and mainly true<br>introduction it's very kind of you<br>it's always nice to have people say nice<br>things about you and yeah actually quite<br>a bit maybe it's double um and I just<br>like to thank that's very kind of you<br>and very thanks for the professorship<br>it's very yeah I appreciate that um I'd<br>like to say thanks for my family for<br>coming high family folks um you guys<br>going to be good good nice to hear okay<br>and I'd also like to thank because I<br>it's not really on a slide but I'd like<br>to thank the biochemistry department<br>because you guys have made a home for me<br>and I remember John cat Felix head of<br>department saying you know one of the<br>things that we like about Peter is he's<br>not a traditional biochemist and I think<br>I measured under my breath when I heard<br>that not a biochemist at all so thanks<br>very much for having a cuckoo in the<br>nest as it were ah so many people haze<br>um okay I was a title today is from<br>Chows Darwin and I was going to just<br>call it endless forms but then I thought<br>you might not come because it'll be<br>the quality of the joke we're going to<br>get tonight doesn't get any better than<br>that<br>so Charles Darwin wrote a book I'm sure<br>you've read it the Origin of Species and<br>you don't need to read it because the<br>only bit that's worth reading is the<br>last paragraph every other paragraph in<br>the book is a lead-up to the last<br>paragraph and there's a bit from that<br>where he says from so simple a beginning<br>endless forms most beautiful and most<br>wonderful have been and are being<br>evolved and this has been a question for<br>me is that endless form saying how do we<br>produce the forms of animals the shapes<br>of animals how are these things put<br>together how are they controlled how the<br>how does that relate to the genes and<br>the pathways that make an animal and how<br>do they change and that's what I want to<br>talk to you about today up there there's<br>some pictures of beetles right beetles<br>are cool visuals are the most species<br>group of animals on earth it's far more<br>interesting than we are but there's just<br>the selection of some beetles and you<br>can look at them and say actually this<br>commonality of form you know some of<br>them the different colors isn't it<br>pretty<br>what a nice diagram and that's what Dan<br>was talking about he was saying for the<br>first time really that these things all<br>descend from a common ancestor and<br>they're all modifications of a basic<br>pattern I think it's a really<br>interesting idea the problem comes when<br>we take that information then we we<br>project it to this picture of diversity<br>so this is a picture of all animal phyla<br>on earth I think I may have missed some<br>of the really weird squishy ones that<br>live between sand grains but while it's<br>easy to see how we get between those<br>different forms when we're talking about<br>beetles how do we get between the<br>different forms of these remarkable and<br>out-of-focus on this side animals right<br>now much better so up there the two<br>important ones that you should probably<br>care about there's a mouse up there and<br>there's an insect right there's a<br>remarkably different animal there's a<br>lot that's different about a very body<br>plan is different and that's what we<br>mean when we talk about a phylum<br>Philemon's the level of classification<br>just below the animal kingdom these are<br>the big different groups of animals how<br>do we get from those how did evolution<br>shape the body forms of whatever the<br>ancestral animal looked like to produce<br>all of that different diversity because<br>that's the diversity that really<br>underpins animal life right beetles are<br>all beetles but actually there's a<br>remarkable diversity just there so when<br>I was an undergraduate student at some<br>Northern University we won't mention<br>Jeff Rick as famous or infamous genetic<br>collateral user called Ming the<br>Merciless because he had one of those<br>did he set an essay question as a when I<br>was a non student which was an typical<br>Ming the Merciless kind of question it<br>was just does macro-evolution equal lots<br>of microevolution other processes that<br>made those little differences between<br>those beetles the same processes that<br>made those differences and I suspect<br>have been setting that question<br>endlessly for years and years and years<br>and may still be doing so but it's a<br>really interesting question is it the<br>same process and so I got really<br>intrigued by this I think he was a<br>little surprised that I must have handed<br>in an essay the size of a PhD thesis<br>discussing why I thought it was or it<br>wasn't the same process right because<br>actually when you start looking at the<br>origins of finer you discover a<br>remarkable thing that remarkable thing<br>is that they all date back to one time<br>in Earth's history or at least all those<br>that we have a fossil record for and<br>that's the Cambrian explosion about 540<br>million years ago something happened and<br>at that something happening point these<br>major body forms appeared so the fossil<br>record of<br>arthropods and the fossil record of<br>echinoderms and the fossil record of<br>chordates all dates back to this one<br>period and in fact no other Feiler have<br>evolved since then as far as we can tell<br>apart from some of the really weird<br>squishy things that live between sand<br>grains all right<br>so something really remarkable happened<br>there which suggests actually maybe it<br>isn't the same process so I was really<br>intrigued by this idea and the key book<br>at the time was a book by Stephen Jay<br>Gould famous evolutionary biologist who<br>wrote this book a wonderful life about<br>this entire problem and he suggested<br>that actually at this point there was a<br>remarkable experimentation with body<br>forms and this is based on these fossils<br>so these are fossil animals these are<br>the first animal fossils that we have in<br>the fossil record that we can understand<br>there are fossils that are in Australia<br>you can go to the website place<br>Adelaide Museum and you see them and<br>they're sort of squishy think they<br>predate the Cambrian explosion but after<br>the Cambrian explosion we get fossils<br>like this in a few places in the world<br>and these are really interesting fossils<br>so up in the top corner I should have<br>brought a pointy thing should now<br>up in the top corner there we have a<br>thing which if you saw on the beach<br>today you would know was a polychaete<br>worm the black thing in the middle with<br>a lot of legs it's an honor cough run<br>those are crawling around the hills of<br>Dunedin as we speak all right one down<br>the bottom in the middle here this guy<br>here from the pattern of its muscles and<br>the formation of its head that's a<br>quartet that is the ancestor of most of<br>the people in this room not sure about<br>you right so suddenly in the fossil<br>record we get these different groups of<br>animals how did they get there why how<br>did they roll and so Stephen Jay Gould<br>so idea was actually there was a this oh<br>it and I wanted to say something of the<br>portal right Stephen in the corner there<br>there's something else right stop many<br>of these animals are things we've<br>recognized but the one in the corner<br>there has five eyes and a trunk okay<br>there's nothing like that living on<br>earth today<br>Stevie Stephen Jay Gould says this is<br>because there was an experimentation<br>with body forms right animals evolved<br>and experimented with body forms and<br>then some of them survived and some of<br>them didn't a really interesting idea<br>almost probably entirely wrong but it<br>was a really cool idea if you take these<br>animals there are there are normal<br>things this is a picture from the Royal<br>Ontario Museum where many of these<br>fossils are and you can see that<br>actually the others jellyfish there<br>there's trilobite switch are strange to<br>us that actually really common in the<br>history the big thing up there is a<br>footlong predator called anomalocaris<br>right there's nothing like that on earth<br>today it's a really cool animal and in<br>fact you know I'd like to meet one<br>doesn't look much worse than most wolves<br>so these things are really cool and they<br>demonstrate that actually there's a lot<br>of diversity and phyla that have<br>disappeared on earth and Stephen Jay<br>Gould would say that this is because<br>these animals were experimenting with<br>body pad maybe there wasn't much genetic<br>change which led to these different body<br>patterns maybe if you have a<br>developmental system which is sort of<br>modular you can put arms and legs<br>wherever you like and that even with<br>very little genetic change you can get<br>all of this diversity and when I was<br>right reading about things another set<br>of experiment came up from some people<br>who are even cooler<br>Edie Lewis the Nobel Prize winner whose<br>names I can't remember at this point and<br>David host knows these guys were looking<br>at the development of fruit flies and<br>they showed some really remarkable<br>things things which spoke to me when I<br>was looking at these fossils in the<br>corner there where it says WT that the<br>head of a fruit fly another scanning<br>electron microscope in the middle that<br>fruit fly has got there would you shut<br>up single mutation and that single<br>mutation it's not me that single<br>mutation makes legs grow out where the<br>antennae should be so the antennae<br>transformed into legs the one on the end<br>but the legs and the mouth part are<br>transformed oh sorry the antennae and<br>their mouth had to transform to delete<br>so single mutations can move body parts<br>around maybe mix them up that's kind of<br>similar to what we see sort of in the in<br>that point and the one down the bottom<br>here is even more interesting fruit<br>flies as you all know every single one<br>of you know has one pair of wings which<br>is unusual own insects most insects have<br>two pairs of wings right<br>fruit flies or flies have evolved that<br>what will their second pair of wings has<br>evolved into a balanced organ called a<br>whole tear but with a mutation we can<br>transform it back again so this is why<br>over here has a mutation which returns<br>two pairs of wings to the fly right it's<br>like an atavistic mutation which allows<br>this thing to look like an ancestral<br>insect one mutation again you're in this<br>position where you've standing to think<br>maybe we can mess with developmental<br>systems to produce perfectly functioning<br>organisms with wildly different body<br>patterns the genes that are involved in<br>these mutations are called Hox genes and<br>they're really interesting genes because<br>they happen in flies they happen in all<br>of you to every animal that we know of<br>or even more most animals apart from<br>those squishy things that you find on<br>the beach most of them have Hox genes<br>and they mostly do some other sorts of<br>jobs and so one of the arguments about<br>what the Burgess Shale animals really<br>represented was experimentation with Hox<br>genes the evolution of oxygen now all of<br>what I've told you is almost entirely<br>wrong right it's a really good story but<br>it turns out that these aren't really<br>single mutations are really complex that<br>inflight does not fly no matter how far<br>you throw it it never flies all right<br>it's not a functioning organism it's a<br>mutant those mutants tell us something<br>about the development of an organism I<br>don't necessarily tell us about the<br>evolution but I was intrigued by this<br>idea that actually maybe we can nail<br>down how much genetic change it requires<br>to have a morphological change in an<br>order so I started to ask these two<br>questions in my career firstly how do<br>you make an animal what do you do to<br>make an animal and then how do you<br>change the way you make an animal to<br>make another sort of animal either<br>differently shaped a beetle or a<br>completely different body petting how do<br>those processes which make an animal<br>evolve so to talk about this I need to<br>introduce you to one of my favorite<br>friends Drosophila melanogaster Hamish<br>is wincing there because he knows it<br>should be called so far of melanogaster<br>Drosophila melanogaster the common fruit<br>fire starts called the vinegar fly we<br>call it that because it's more it's<br>easier to import vinegar flies into New<br>Zealand than fruit flies because MPI<br>doesn't recognize there might be<br>different sorts of fruit fly so this is<br>fruit fly we've been studying not me<br>people have been studying fruit flies<br>since 1910 and it means that we have a<br>whole set of tools to understand how<br>this fly works we have ways of turning<br>genes off we have genes at ways of<br>turning genes on we have two ways of<br>turning genes on and off in places where<br>they shouldn't be turned on and that's<br>remarkably useful and has enabled us to<br>know more about the development of that<br>animal than any other animal on earth<br>all right we know how fruit fly works<br>far better than we know how you work<br>which is great so when I started trying<br>to ask the question how do we make an<br>animal obviously the place to start was<br>in Drosophila so let me show you how we<br>make an animal right just add water this<br>is two views of the same embryo this is<br>a technology an imaging technology<br>called light sheet microscopy which<br>Vernon is going to buy after this<br>lecture<br>only a million or so dollars so this is<br>from Howard Hughes Medical Institute<br>digital image embryo project we're<br>looking at two phases of an embryo the<br>top and the bottom a drosophila embryo<br>embryo is already three hours old okay<br>so a lot of the early developments<br>already done I'm just going to watch the<br>development of this embryo this is the<br>development from what was a<br>single-celled organism to one with<br>morphology with structure with purpose<br>alright so I'm going to push the button<br>and stuff is going to happen and I'm<br>going to talk to you about it there's<br>two key processes going on here the<br>first one is called patterning if you<br>look about I see a lot of timing on crap<br>now you'll see that there are kind of<br>stripes across the embryo right stripes<br>are segmentation fruit flies are insects<br>they're segmented that's a patterning<br>process the embryo which was<br>undifferentiated as being divided up<br>into chunks process called patterning<br>the other thing you need to notice is<br>cell fate if you guys big cells at the<br>top there they're not thinks of the big<br>nuclei both of the cells of a particular<br>tissue called the amnio serosa they're<br>different from the cells around it<br>because they've worked out where they<br>are through a patenting process and<br>they've changed their fate they turned<br>into some other thought itself so those<br>two processes are key to development<br>patterning and cell fates and talk a<br>little bit about both of them<br>but I want to show you something<br>remarkable and it's going to happen<br>about I was going to happen I see I've<br>got the timing to everyone's gotta have<br>an about now about now about now all for<br>God's sake there we go look at that you<br>see that it's putting why is it<br>twitching it just made muscles it's now<br>learning how to connect those muscles to<br>its nervous system and in a second when<br>the film stops what's going to crawl<br>away as a living breathing reacting<br>working maggot okay it's not quite as<br>cool as if it have been a gazelle but<br>that's pretty awesome isn't it and that<br>was in 18 hours 18 hours from just laid<br>egg to an organism that works patterning<br>and cell-fate it's awesome so when I<br>started looking at this process I<br>thought to myself ah I want to go and<br>learn how that works so I went and<br>worked with this guy Dave Hartley at the<br>Imperial College in London and we were<br>studying the development of the nervous<br>system so the nervous system is that<br>obviously a key part of being an animal<br>there's there's a picture up there you<br>see the red picture that's labeled C you<br>can see that's the nervous is in that<br>red thing that kind of coma shaped<br>object is the nervous system of a fruit<br>fly so we're interested in how cells<br>decided to become part of the nervous<br>system because cells have to decide that<br>they're going to be nervous themselves<br>or if they're going to be skin cells in<br>Drosophila embryo just below that comma<br>one you can see one whereas particular<br>process has been messed up a process<br>called not cell signaling without that<br>process all of those cells in the<br>ventral part of the embryo have turned<br>into nervous as themselves right that's<br>at the expense of skin cells so that<br>embryo has a big brain and not enough<br>skin and we all know someone like that<br>right alongside going going think Karen<br>over there's also those whiter embryos<br>those are actually the embryos of a<br>completely different organism a frog<br>because it turns out that not self<br>signaling which defines the nervous<br>system in a fruit fly also defines the<br>nervous system and all of us right<br>they're very ancient and conserved<br>process by which cells determine whether<br>they're going to become nervous as<br>themselves or something else and in<br>humans when it gets messed up we die as<br>embryos everyone in this room has a<br>perfectly functioning not cell signaling<br>pathway because you wouldn't be sitting<br>here if you didn't so I learned a lot<br>about this kind of process and learning<br>how to use for software as a way to ask<br>questions about biology but then I kind<br>of got the itch to do something<br>different and so I went back to asking<br>the next question which is how do those<br>processes change over evolutionary time<br>so I worked also shouldn't practice you<br>talk so that's the that's the process<br>that went wrong okay it's a complex cell<br>signaling pathway with a lot of<br>biochemical things and proteins and<br>stuff all of you who have by chemists in<br>the room is on your hair that's pretty<br>cool everyone else is going what the<br>hell is that remember that there will be<br>an exam on it later we're coming back<br>okay right so into Cambridge and work<br>with this guy Michael Hagen who worked<br>at the Museum of Zoology at the<br>University of Cambridge and has interest<br>Michael a comb has been a remarkable<br>scientist and studying<br>segmentation the process that I showed<br>you in that embryo the dividing up of<br>the embryo into chunks in a fruit fly it<br>done much of the work to understand how<br>segmentation work<br>fruit fly by the time I started working<br>with him he decided that he wanted to<br>work out how that worked in other<br>organisms and particularly that Encik<br>below that the African plague locust so<br>I worked on African plague locust for<br>three years and and that's long enough<br>right they're not they're not a plague<br>for no reason they're horrible things<br>they eat each other they eat you they<br>make you sneeze they poo everywhere<br>they're just dreadful things but they<br>are remarkable and they have a<br>completely different embryo to the fruit<br>fly they're still an insect they still<br>get segmented but it's a completely<br>different embryo they're also 350<br>million years diverged from fruit fliers<br>right that's older than the divergence<br>of us and reptiles probably and possibly<br>fish it's a very long evolutionary<br>distance so by studying what was<br>happening in this species we hope to<br>learn new things about how segmentation<br>worked unfortunately the African plague<br>locust is a horrible organism to work<br>with not only because of its nasty<br>behavior but also it has a genome which<br>is 10 times the size of the human genome<br>which means that cloning a gene in the<br>African plague focus is is very<br>difficult so we did though and what we<br>found was actually the genes that we<br>cloned genes that controlled<br>segmentation in a fruit fly we're the<br>same genes which controlled segmentation<br>and a locust right the gene chordal up<br>their labels defines the posterior faith<br>in it in a locust defines posterior fate<br>in a fruit fly hunchback the brown stain<br>in the middle of that embryo defines<br>those central regions in a in a locus<br>that defined central and anterior<br>regions in a fruit fly 350 million years<br>of evolution in a completely different<br>embryo and we have very very similar<br>genes that's right we haven't started<br>yet<br>and we haven't got to bees yet so you're<br>good<br>the pair brie and wingless are also<br>genes involved in segmentation and<br>Drosophila they're also expressed in a<br>pattern suggesting they have a role in<br>segmentation in n locus same genes 350<br>million years evolution but there's<br>details that are different some of the<br>genes are expressed in slightly<br>different patterns the timing by which<br>they appear is slightly different as if<br>these organisms are using the same genes<br>but they're using them slightly<br>differently after working now when to<br>agriculture Canada which was a Abner and<br>worked with this thing the two spotted<br>spider mite right which is a pest of<br>agricultural stuff it's also not an<br>insect it's more closely related to<br>spiders and the common ancestor between<br>spiders and insects lived before the<br>time of the Cambrian explosion right in<br>the Burgess Shale there are the<br>ancestors insects and they are the sorry<br>a man type of insect and there are the<br>ancestors of spiders so this is over 540<br>million years diverged from Drosophila<br>it uses the same genes to segment its<br>body which is weird it turns out when we<br>sequence the human genome that many of<br>the genes which segment the drosophila<br>embryo are also in your genome<br>suggesting that actually the genes that<br>are used in development are very highly<br>conserved<br>they don't change very much which raises<br>the question how do we get any change at<br>all for using the same genes why am I<br>not a beetle so it's very difficult to<br>litterin this thing because it keeps<br>sliding off so if I do the I'm actually<br>thinking it would thank good beachwear<br>apart from being flammable right<br>everybody would be awesome and and I<br>think if you took it in the sea you<br>drown right disappointing so what we<br>were doing was depressing to me at the<br>end of those two postdocs I thought<br>there was one of those moments where as<br>a scientist I'm sure we've all had them<br>it's like is it time to give up science<br>and take up knitting for a living<br>because frankly this is going nowhere<br>we're defining that the same genes do<br>these processes but we don't understand<br>what those genes do or how they do it we<br>can't even prove that these genes are<br>actually involved in the processes we<br>think they are right because we can't do<br>the key experiment which we can do<br>Drosophila which is to turn them off and<br>see what happens we can't do that why<br>are we bothering and also how do I<br>understand the way a gene changes its<br>regulation when I don't have any<br>information I don't have the genome<br>sequence of a locust so how do I work<br>out how those genes are changing the way<br>they work and so I was really kind of<br>depressed about this but the good thing<br>is that in that depression I turned to<br>the internet and discovered some very<br>salient fact which made me change the<br>way I worked on the subject so when I<br>started doing a PhD student I was<br>offered two PhD places one in London<br>Worth Dave Hadley and one in Cambridge<br>which was to sequence the alcohol<br>dehydrogenase locus of the common fruit<br>fly Drosophila melanogaster right which<br>one would you take London or boring<br>stuff with drug related things and flies<br>why I got it wrong because that project<br>was the start of the Drosophila genome<br>project on the way to sequencing the<br>human genome as practice they sequenced<br>the genome of the fruit fight net<br>changed the way we work suddenly all<br>those guys who worked and fruit flies<br>had enormous resources that I never had<br>so I wanted to I wanted that that was<br>good that would help me understand how<br>genes change their regulation the next<br>thing that happened as they sequence the<br>human genome good excellent don't really<br>care about humans but good the key thing<br>is they got it out of the way and some<br>universities and research institutes had<br>spent millions of dollars on sequencing<br>equipment and they've done the genome<br>what the hell are they going to do now<br>well so what do you do you start<br>sequencing things you think are<br>important the next insects to be<br>sequenced were mosquitoes and I thought<br>to myself I could work on mosquitoes and<br>then I thought no I don't really want to<br>work in an organism that sucks my blood<br>that would be a mistake also difficult<br>to import to New Zealand because they<br>carry malaria and dengue airings and<br>then I heard the sequencing the genome<br>of the honeybee a species I really<br>didn't care anything about but the<br>honeybee turned out to be the solution<br>to all these problems so honeybees are<br>really important insects and you all<br>know that and we'll talk about when talk<br>about they're the most I like to say<br>they're the most economically important<br>insects but that's probably a lie<br>they're certainly important for most<br>human food production and they're nice<br>and friendly and we like them they're<br>good things okay<br>and that's why their genome was being<br>sequenced and sequencing the genome was<br>bad to learn about you know looking<br>after beers so when I came back to New<br>Zealand I was really pleased to be hired<br>by the biochemistry department working<br>on bees<br>I still don't believe that they realize<br>what the hell I was supposed to be doing<br>though carefulness is that they did and<br>I'd really like to thank Warren for<br>taking a punt frankly there's a guy<br>going to work on these and he hired me<br>and I'd also like to thank five I don't<br>ask why Bronson is here but he also let<br>this idiot work in the genetics teaching<br>program when my genetics has put poor<br>frankly<br>so thanks quiet honey bees are awesome<br>having the genome sequence of honeybees<br>was really good when I heard that they<br>were sequencing the genome of the<br>honeybee I started doing some working<br>hanabi's published some papers and got<br>involved with a honeybee genome<br>sequencing project I got asked to be<br>involved and so my lab and the lab of<br>Allison Mercer also at Otago health<br>publish the honeybee genome sequence in<br>2006 which is a really key achievement<br>for us it taught me a whole load of<br>things we did all kinds of things that<br>I've never done before but also helped<br>us identify all of those genes that we<br>thought were involved in sequencing and<br>segmentation in Drosophila we could see<br>them in the honeybee genome as well we<br>could look at those genes and work out<br>how they were regularly regulated so now<br>we had a way to look at the way gene<br>regulation changes we still needed a<br>technology to turn genes on and off and<br>luckily at exactly the same time<br>that technology came along so technology<br>called RNA interference and it's<br>complicated but it's a process that<br>occurs in all eukaryotic cells it turns<br>out that we respond to double-stranded<br>RNA if we put double-stranded RNA of a<br>particular sequence into a cell then<br>most cells respond by taking that<br>double-stranded RNA reading the sequence<br>and using that sequence to destroy<br>either RNA of a similar sequence or to<br>turn off the DNA copy of a gene so it<br>enables us if we have the sequence of a<br>gene to turn that gene off okay to get<br>double-stranded RNA into a honeybee<br>embryo is tricky it involves micro<br>injection and the picture you can see up<br>there is a single honeybee embryo and<br>that sort of green thing coming in from<br>the side is a needle filled with<br>double-stranded RNA that needle is finer<br>than a human hair and we're<br>using it to inject that embryo to turn<br>off a particular gene with this<br>technology we could now turn off<br>individual genes during segmentation and<br>fruit in the honeybee and I did these<br>genes do the same job that leaders in<br>Drosophila this work was funded by the<br>Muslim funder and by fantastic postdoc<br>Megan Wilson who showed me this result<br>and I almost fell off a check here we<br>have two larvae honeybees also produce<br>maggoty looking things the one here that<br>says DFC GFP is a wild-type larva which<br>has been injected with a piece of<br>double-stranded RNA which isn't present<br>in the honeybee genome that's our<br>control the one next to us has been<br>injected with double-stranded RNA<br>against a gene called giant and giant<br>and drosophila controls the development<br>of the head and it honeybee is when you<br>knock it out the head disappears it says<br>that actually it's doing the same job so<br>it enables us to test the function of a<br>gene we can also using the genome<br>sequence look to see how those genes are<br>regulated in Drosophila at the top there<br>euphemistically called draw draw sees we<br>have a picture of the giant gene right<br>in the genome and those little Taggy<br>things sticking off the genome sequence<br>those are places where proteins bind to<br>that DNA all done by other people using<br>Drosophila genetic tools those little<br>regions which are in boxes those are<br>regulatory regions these drive the<br>expression of giants and the embryos<br>underneath it old multicolored yawning<br>these look at the green colored that's<br>where giant is expressed in the<br>Drosophila embryo down the bottom we<br>have the same picture and bees we've got<br>the embryos down the bottom giant is<br>expressed in anterior regions just as it<br>is in Drosophila we can also identify<br>regions of the genome just upstream of<br>the giant gene and honeybees which we<br>think regulated we can identify the<br>proteins involved in that process but<br>proteins that are binding to that DNA<br>and are turning the giant gene on and<br>off and we can test those predictions<br>with RNA interference this is going to<br>be very difficult to do without a<br>pointer so at the top here we have a<br>Geno embryo which is all blue it stains<br>for a gene called Coral I am Kadett says<br>there that blue staining shows where the<br>RNA from that gene is where that gene is<br>turned on underneath that there's a gene<br>called hunchback<br>which is expressed in the anterior<br>regions the embryo hard to think that<br>why<br>called or THAAD entacle okay these are<br>the proteins are will lead to the RNA<br>the proteins these are the genes which<br>encode the proteins which bind to that<br>sequence of DNA upstream of the giant<br>gene so when we knock them out if those<br>proteins regulate the giant gene then<br>they should change the expression of<br>that gene and that's exactly what we see<br>so over on the other side there's an<br>embryo which is all blue<br>it's an embryo that have stained four<br>giant which at the bottom you can see is<br>expressed in anterior regions of the<br>embryo when we knock out caudal it's<br>expressed everywhere so caudal represses<br>giant all right the next embryo down<br>we've knocked out Hunchback Hunchback<br>must activate giant because when we<br>knock out Hunchback there's no giant the<br>same width or thaad entacle and another<br>author identical gene we don't like to<br>talk about underneath all of those genes<br>and those interactions allow us to draw<br>network diagrams of how these genes work<br>together to segment the embryo and we<br>know what that network looks like in<br>Drosophila it looks like that 30 years<br>of research on Drosophila has indicated<br>that those are the network interactions<br>which segment the Drosophila embryo all<br>right don't try and understand it it's<br>inexplicable it can only be understood<br>by modeling in a computer and most the<br>time when people try that it doesn't<br>work which indicates that while we think<br>we know what we're doing here we don't<br>really when we test those interactions<br>in a B what we see is they're different<br>there are different set of interactions<br>same genes different set of interactions<br>so what's happening during the evolution<br>of this process in that 250 million<br>years of evolution between bees and<br>flies is not new genes evolving it's the<br>genes remain the same but the wiring<br>diagram that holds them together changes<br>right suddenly there's a lot of<br>developmental evolution going on here<br>but there's not a lot of actual change<br>when we look at segmentation and a/b and<br>segmentation and fruit fly it looks<br>almost identical but underlying that<br>almost identical nature there's a hell<br>of a lot of evolution going on so while<br>I went out looking to see if I could<br>find cases where small amount of genetic<br>change led to a large morphological<br>change what I found was a case where not<br>a lot of morphological change was<br>underpinned by lots and lots of<br>evolution<br>which annoyed me immensely and was<br>another one of those moments when you<br>say actually knitting looks like a<br>better occupation than this but then I<br>thought actually Peter you are one of<br>the biggest idiots that has ever walked<br>the earth because bees already tell us<br>the answer to the question I wanted to<br>know bees already produce vastly<br>different morphologies with no genetic<br>change at all you all know that I've<br>forgotten bees produce two female casts<br>workers and queen bees those is a<br>honeybee looks like an e bee but they<br>will produce drones which are male bees<br>and are so embarrassing we're not going<br>to talk about them and they produce<br>workers and queens workers and queen<br>bees are both female bees all right we<br>can induce any worker or any female<br>embryo any female lava we like to form a<br>queen just by changing its position in<br>the hive and queen bees are larger they<br>lay eggs they behave differently they<br>smell differently they're different<br>colors and they live 20 times longer<br>than worker bees right these are not<br>minor changes this is a very different<br>organism and that very different<br>organism is triggered with no genetic<br>change at all just diet so I came to the<br>revelation that actually I've done been<br>doing these experiments wrong all these<br>years instead of studying processes<br>where things don't evolve things don't<br>change and understand what the<br>developmental process is that why are we<br>not just studying that how do we get<br>Queen and worker bees how does diet<br>trigger these kind of changes now I<br>would tell you about this but when I<br>started giving this practicing let's<br>talk this afternoon it was an hour and a<br>half long and so I've been throwing out<br>slides all afternoon and I accidentally<br>threw out all the slides involved in<br>this process and to apologize<br>really fantastic stuff um but actually<br>the problem with it is that it's really<br>hard to test what we find we can find<br>genes which are always turned on in<br>Queens which we think are required to<br>make a queen bee but testing that and<br>trying to knock out those genes in a bee<br>which is seeing if we can produce Queens<br>or not is really really hard it involves<br>feeding larval bees in the lab and there<br>just are not enough graduate students in<br>the world prepared to stay up and feed<br>bees continuously ok so we gave that up<br>we did it we published it we gave it up<br>I want to talk about another thing that<br>these do which is kind of similar so<br>it's talking about a change in<br>environmental change which triggers<br>different development different<br>morphology and it turns out that<br>actually there's another thing that bees<br>do related to caste development which is<br>the same kind of process queen bees<br>repress worker bee reproduction we know<br>that because in I've you all know the<br>queen bee lays all the eggs while the<br>workers do all the work okay but<br>actually the queen actively represses<br>reproduction in their workers and they<br>do it through a pheromone called Queen<br>mandibular pheromone so if we look at<br>the ovaries of a worker in a queen the<br>ovaries of a queen bee under under the<br>queen there are huge actually those are<br>some of the biggest ovaries you'll see<br>in the insect world<br>you should be impressed but you're<br>obviously not in a worker they're much<br>smaller and that's to do with that royal<br>jelly diaper they get early in life okay<br>it's not terribly exciting but the key<br>point is that if you take the Queen away<br>from a hive those worker ovaries<br>activate they start developing and<br>producing eggs okay and it's a process<br>like a change in form and so I thought<br>actually here's a model system that I<br>can work with because I can manipulate<br>this with all kinds of nasty ways this<br>is a process that we could work out how<br>this works and manipulate it so we<br>wanted to ask the question how do worker<br>bees respond to Queen mandibular<br>pheromone and what happens when you take<br>that Queen mandibular pheromone away and<br>luckily the third technology which<br>really changed my research came along we<br>sequenced the genome that changed<br>everything I did RNA interference<br>changed everything I did and the last<br>thing was high-throughput genomics oh it<br>sounds rock and roll so once people had<br>sequenced the human genome they turned<br>their attention to fine<br>being cheaper ways to sequence DNA<br>cheaper faster better it costs several<br>billion dollars to sequence the first<br>human genome we can do it in the<br>biochemistry department for a couple of<br>thousand dollars in a weeks of your<br>worth of your time okay this has changed<br>because of the way of fantastic<br>achievements in micro fabrication and<br>ways of dealing with massive amounts of<br>data this means that actually we no<br>longer deal with individual genes gone<br>are the days where I look for the<br>hunchback gene now I look at loads of<br>genes all the genes in the genome and<br>how they respond in a developmental<br>situation so I'm going to do some<br>teaching here right Warren is going to<br>throw something at me about halfway<br>through here so you look at it I want to<br>tell you a piece of information which is<br>the central dogma of molecular biology<br>do I need to stand further away ok so<br>it's called the central dogma<br>because molecular biologists don't<br>believe in law right there's no law of<br>thermodynamics in molecular biology is<br>normally they're just the central dogma<br>it's called the central dogma because<br>like most dogma it's wrong in all kinds<br>of ways but the idea is that information<br>flows in a Cell from DNA to RNA and<br>other sort of molecule to protein ok and<br>the proteins do stuff this is where<br>Warren throws something at me because he<br>knows very well the actually RNA does<br>stuff as well but we're not going to<br>talk about that protein does stuff and<br>that information comes from DNA and RNA<br>is a molecule in between that carries<br>that information I like to think of the<br>genome stupidly as a medieval library<br>and follow me on this it's a really good<br>metaphor right in a medieval library<br>you've got all these big books with the<br>information in them but because they're<br>so valuable you chain them to the<br>shelves I can't take the books out so<br>Bob the Baker who wants a new recipe for<br>whatever they eat in medieval times he<br>goes to his books he can't take the book<br>out to his bakery he has to copy it out<br>and he copies out the recipe and he<br>takes it off and turns it into protein<br>which does stuff but he's not an idiot<br>he doesn't copy the whole book he only<br>copies the bits that he needs and cells<br>are like that as well they don't to make<br>RNA from the whole genome they make it<br>from only the genes that they need and<br>so if we look at the molecules which are<br>in RNA in a Cell that's a reflection of<br>what genes are turned<br>on okay so we can take an active ovary<br>one where that queen bee has gone away<br>and sequence all the RNA and those are<br>the genes which are required to make an<br>active ovary and if we take a repressed<br>ovary we can look at all those genes and<br>compare them and say what's different<br>what's changed across the whole genome<br>which is remarkable right using<br>high-throughput genomics we can sequence<br>every piece of RNA and say which genes<br>are on in this tissue that are not on in<br>that tissue so working with a bunch of<br>people with the help of Sir Peter<br>Gluckman who's the guy with the hamster<br>be at there and Hugh Blair from Massey<br>University and Frank Bloomfield from<br>Auckland University we undertook to look<br>at differences in gene expression<br>between actors workers repressed workers<br>and queen bees and all this work was<br>done by a little Lizabeth Duncan who is<br>now at the University of Leeds right<br>much better University no kidding so we<br>took this RNA we sequenced it and we<br>looked at what genes are different what<br>changes between these two conditions and<br>they're really frightening thing is a<br>moment in my life where I really thought<br>actually<br>everything I've done isn't completely<br>you've seen it before it's not cell<br>signaling right it was just amazing I<br>was looking at list of gene names and<br>going I know of these names these are<br>genes I've worked with in Drosophila is<br>not cell signaling my god is not cell<br>signaling what is not so signaling do<br>controls the development of the nervous<br>system and here it is it's the thing<br>that's changing between active and<br>inactive worker ovaries now let's get<br>biochemical for a moment not cell<br>signaling as a process whereby two cells<br>talk to each other without a pointer<br>this is going to be fun a one cell up<br>the envy you can see the cell in the top<br>corner it's talking to the big cell down<br>the bottom here it's talking through two<br>proteins called serrate and Delta and<br>they bind to that big chunky thing in<br>the middle called the notch receptor<br>when that limos proteins interact a bit<br>of the notch receptor is cut off by that<br>lump of things that says gamma secretase<br>complex alright and that bit of the<br>notch receptor goes into the nucleus<br>where it turns on some genes turns on<br>some genes called the enhancer of split<br>complex the world's most stupid name for<br>a set of genes okay<br>we're going to remember those things<br>remember but if they're not receptor<br>goes into the nucleus when signaling is<br>occurring a bit of the not receptor is<br>in the nucleus is sending on a set of<br>genes the enhancer of split genes genes<br>that low and behold add studied in the<br>honeybee for their role in nervous<br>system development right there's a<br>complex of genes this so cool it's it's<br>I'm aching to tell you about it but I<br>can't write can I talk to the after see<br>tell me about the enhancer a split<br>complete awesome these genes respond to<br>national signals so in a cell which is<br>receiving a signal through that not-self<br>signaling pathway these genes are on it<br>turned on they're expressed okay so we<br>can identify every cell which is<br>receiving a signal through that notch<br>receptor because it will Express<br>enhancer or split genes so we said to<br>ourselves we're in the ovary is this<br>role of not cell signaling happening and<br>we found it in one place these Lobby<br>diagrams down the black in the back<br>there with a blue staining those are<br>staining the nuclei of cells of the germ<br>areum of the ovary of a honeybee okay<br>this is just a part of the ovary doesn't<br>really matter it's a bit that really<br>does stuff because in the germ areum are<br>the germ<br>stem cells which are the cells which go<br>to make our sites right so in that<br>region what we've got here is those<br>that's the staining in blue those are<br>the nuclei on the other side those are<br>the same same ovaries but stain four<br>enhancer of split genes and those are<br>actually ovaries from different bees so<br>in the top that's an ovary from a queen<br>right worker a worker with a queen in<br>the hive underneath it's a worker<br>without a queen and at the bottom that's<br>a queen ovary and the enhancer a split<br>gene is only turned on in the top one<br>when a queen is in the hive the enhancer<br>of split genes are turned on and the<br>Jumeirah of the ovary okay<br>that's the only time I've ever found<br>something so clear that it stands out<br>like that kind of Wow that's amazing<br>I almost look every time I look at this<br>diagram I wonder if I've made it up so<br>clear it's on where you have a queen<br>thought that was a good point to<br>interrupt your work we can show that<br>this is actually due to not self<br>signaling because as I told you<br>a bit of the notch receptor when<br>signaling occuring goes into the nucleus<br>okay if we tagged that better than not<br>receptor with an antibody if not self<br>signaling is active we should see it in<br>the nucleus right so under there in the<br>red staining under repressed you can see<br>those little blobby things that's again<br>the Jumeirah moven ovary and those<br>little blobby things are nuclei I know<br>their nuclei because just underneath the<br>red staining there's blue staining which<br>is staining DNA where which lives in the<br>nucleus you know that they overlap<br>because if you look right at the bottom<br>and ignore the green stuff it's purple<br>the red and the green overlap entirely<br>the not receptor is in the nucleus not<br>signaling is active so in a repressed<br>worker not sealing is active in an<br>active worker<br>there's no not receptor it's gone we<br>can't see it at all so there's a clear<br>difference than nitrous isn't signaling<br>going on when the Queen is there and<br>it's not when the Queen isn't there but<br>here's the problem right what I've shown<br>you is the same old crap I keep showing<br>you it's correlations it oh yeah these<br>gene expressions look like they do the<br>thing how do we prove it well we prove<br>it by doing manipulative experiments<br>that's why it's fun to work on these<br>we can't do our nai and add all these<br>because they don't like it but we<br>discover the way to block not cell<br>signaling in another way the way we did<br>it was using a drug so I told you that<br>the not receptor is cleaved by a little<br>complex of proteins called the gamma<br>secretase complex and those of you who<br>are Warren will be going the gamma<br>secretase complex that's the thing that<br>has a role in Alzheimer's disease in<br>humans it's a drug target for<br>Alzheimer's disease bees don't get outs<br>homers disease they use their gamma<br>secretase complex to cleave the notch<br>receptor but there are lots of<br>pharmaceutical companies out here who<br>have developed drugs to block the gamma<br>secretase complex because they think it<br>might be therapeutic for Alzheimer's<br>disease so we decided to put our B's on<br>Alzheimer's drugs doesn't make them<br>forget things but it does something<br>remarkable so the drug we're using here<br>is a thing called depth it's got a real<br>name that I can't pronounce it and it's<br>several miles long so we're going to<br>call it depth what we did is we took<br>these and we shoved them in that little<br>box up there all right so it took about<br>50 to 100 these and we shoved them in<br>that little box and we fed them either<br>depth or food without that we've had<br>more food but food with or without debt<br>okay the the the box is a really highly<br>technical thing it's close with a piece<br>of tape so I'd like to thank also who<br>volunteered his thumb to stick over the<br>hole while we were changing the food<br>it's good something I would never have<br>done myself<br>I don't know thought I was here probably<br>because he's still in hospital these<br>shoved in a cage without a queen start<br>laying eggs okay because they activate<br>their ovaries we can also by Queen<br>mandibular pheromone because actually<br>some Canadian cameras discovered all the<br>components of Queen mandibular pheromone<br>and it's used by beekeepers to look<br>after their bees so we can treat these<br>bees with Queen mandibular pheromone we<br>can treat them without Queen mandibular<br>pheromone we can treat them with or<br>without debt and that's exactly what we<br>did what would we expect if not self<br>signaling is required to repress the<br>ovaries when we block not cell signaling<br>they should activate their ovaries that<br>process is downstream of quick Queen<br>mandibular pheromone right so Queen<br>mandibular pheromone should lose in a<br>fight to debt death Oh<br>so what we do is we took the bees we<br>ripped out their ovaries two weeks later<br>all right and we scored them double<br>blinds fantastic experiment on the scale<br>of ovary activation from zero which is<br>not active to three which is really<br>active and we use those numbers to<br>provide an ovary activation score and we<br>looked at how that ovary activation<br>scored with our various treatments bees<br>without qmp which is control - qmp those<br>guys activate their ovaries as you would<br>expect when we give them qmp which is<br>the middle pen control + q MP they don't<br>activate their ovaries okay the ovary<br>activation score is lower but if we give<br>them depth and qmp they activate their<br>ovaries more there's two copies of this<br>experiment because it turns out there's<br>also an input from season one of those<br>experiments was done in spring and one<br>of them was done in autumn and autumn<br>bees love to activate their ovaries and<br>that's the second experiment you can see<br>that actually with depth they activate<br>their ovaries just slightly more than if<br>they have no TV at all<br>depth beats qmp but we've shown that not<br>cell signaling this ancient conserved<br>process which controls nervous system<br>development has been taken by queen bees<br>to control workers right here's a<br>process that has evolved it's evolved in<br>bees this is a bee specific thing<br>what did they choose the day of old few<br>genes today even invent some genes that<br>I didn't know about no they went up it<br>genes that I've studied as a PhD student<br>classics developmental genes alright<br>there's no new genes here it's just<br>fiddling with the ones that we actually<br>have so what have I learned from this<br>process of studying developmental<br>processes well I learnt that actually<br>the process that I naively thought could<br>be fiddled with easily to produce<br>different morphologies is actually<br>incredibly complicated that these<br>processes are rewired constantly during<br>evolution and it's that rewiring of<br>conserved genes and pathways that's<br>important even when new things evolve<br>it's often old genes that do those<br>processes we don't invent new genes<br>during evolutions we just use the ones<br>we've got also I like to think that<br>developmental evolution is a bit like a<br>swan on a fast flowing river right it<br>looks like nothing's really happening<br>but even when developmental processes<br>are the same such as segmentation<br>the little feet of that Swan are working<br>damn hard rewiring those networks over<br>and over again and I'm beginning to<br>believe that actually those networks<br>might drift but actually if there isn't<br>strong selective pressure on them they<br>might change just for fun as long as<br>they work those networks might be really<br>easy to change turns out that there's no<br>simple answer to these problems I<br>thought there was going to be a simple<br>answer and it turns out there isn't and<br>actually I'm more infused than Ava was<br>because that complexity is really<br>interesting and now ladies and gentlemen<br>and just because Vernon said so we use<br>this stuff I've been talking to you<br>rabbiting on for what seems like several<br>hours about fundamental developmental<br>processes I'm really glad that none of<br>you Center bits okay only a few of you<br>seem to be asleep the real kicker here<br>is that actually non modeling zigs apart<br>from Drosophila we know nothing about<br>most insects yet the most diverse group<br>of organisms of animals on earth are<br>beetles the second most diverse group of<br>animals on earth are mice bees and birds<br>insects are really really important and<br>we know very little about them and yet<br>they're really important to us to bees<br>their pollination is required for our<br>food production and so 1/3 apparently<br>1/3 of the crops we eat require bees for<br>pollination 1/3 of the stored green we<br>collect is eaten by beetles right what<br>is our response to this<br>well we think all insects are pests most<br>of you in this room think they're icky<br>and I bet most of you have a can of<br>black fat flag I'm right in the back of<br>your drawer right which you've sprayed<br>which is a compound which kills every<br>insect and spiders and nematode worms<br>and most other things on planets we have<br>this really vertebrate view of the world<br>and we've got to get over it because<br>actually insects are awesome right so<br>we're trying to use the technologies and<br>the ideas that we've developed in these<br>fundamental projects to help solve<br>problems with insect biology for the<br>Ministry of Primary and administrative<br>and business innovation employment we're<br>developing selective insecticides by<br>understanding the genome and the<br>development of bees we can target<br>pathways which work differently in<br>these two other insects and hopefully<br>find chemicals which kill other insects<br>leaving out bees alone for the buyer<br>protection core we're using those same<br>technologies to address some of the<br>pasture pests in New Zealand<br>particularly the add infant stem weevil<br>for the New Zealand for the biological<br>heritage National Science Challenge<br>we're deploying RNA interference we<br>developed and bees to kill wasps I don't<br>think is a very good idea but we'll do<br>it anyway and for the Ministry of<br>Primary Industries and for the AG mark<br>we've been studying inbreeding in New<br>Zealand bees to try and make sure that<br>we have healthy bee populations in this<br>country none of this is an extra bit of<br>research now this is all that supplied<br>research is not as good as the stuff<br>over here which is your fundamental<br>research it's all a continuum and I'm<br>delighted that actually I developed<br>technologies to turn off genes and bees<br>but I can use that to turn off genes in<br>a wasp and perhaps kill them in new and<br>exciting ways or at least specific ways<br>alongside this everyone mentioned it so<br>I'll just get through it science doesn't<br>happen in a vacuum we need to talk to<br>the taxpayers who pay for our research<br>we need to talk to the communities who<br>are going to implement and use our<br>research in future years and so I'm<br>really proud to have been involved with<br>11 a Vox project which to date and Craig<br>is going to throw something at me this<br>point has interacted with almost 10,000<br>rural New Zealanders and talking to them<br>about all kinds of science from physics<br>chemistry marine science but mainly<br>about insects particularly bees I think<br>that's right lavender box is a<br>collaboration with lots of people<br>including the otago museum so I've been<br>really delighted that actually my<br>research can be translated into things<br>which are useful for industry you think<br>that are useful for the environment but<br>also can get out to both people who are<br>going to use those kinds of technologies<br>and I urge you all to do the same thing<br>finally<br>they say that it takes a village to<br>raise a child I don't really know what<br>that means because I don't live in the<br>chart in a village and my children seem<br>vaguely okay but it certainly takes a<br>village to raise a scientist and so um<br>I'd like to thank all of these people<br>and I hope you're reading and seeing if<br>your name is there if it isn't there<br>that's probably an oversight because<br>you've all helped me so much there are<br>people who have worked in my lab in in<br>there and so those people I'd like to<br>say sorry there are people who are my<br>collaborators her people who have helped<br>me get involved in all kinds of new<br>ideas and things and so you know you<br>guys have been awesome thank you so very<br>much and and stuff and you all deserve<br>to buy yourself a drink and drink it<br>finally of course the people I need to<br>thank the most this lot not the guy in<br>the middle with the stupid but my<br>family and my fantastic wife science is<br>an immensely dispiriting occupation<br>right and I say this to all of you young<br>scientists aspiring to my job it's<br>really depressing you know I submitted a<br>paper to nature recently and noticed<br>that I've had six papers rejected by<br>nature in my career and and that's kind<br>of one a year you know it's really quite<br>depressing and it's nice to know that<br>even though your colleagues and the<br>scientific community think your work is<br>rubbish your family still like you it's<br>nice to know people who judge you not on<br>your scientific output and so I'd like<br>to thank my family for providing sanity<br>in in this difficult business that's all<br>for me thank you so much for the thing<br>and it's been a privilege to work with<br>right because following behind t-shirt<br>is really not something that England<br>wants to do to have to speak behind<br>Peter I think he's really just I guess<br>provided us with a fine description of<br>his research and his passion and<br>inspiration I think if you've missed<br>that I think no one in this room will<br>have missed that because he is one of<br>the most passionate researchers and<br>communicators that we know and so it's<br>really a privilege for me to speak and<br>to thank Peter firstly for his talk<br>I think it's he's given us a beautiful<br>tour through his research and from his<br>career which is from Wellington to<br>London on to Cambridge and then back to<br>London but in an Ontario and then on to<br>Dunedin the early I think for the young<br>scientists here has talking about the<br>decision-making processes and the early<br>thoughts that he had in the way he<br>changed and then sometimes came back<br>around is really a lesson for us all and<br>it was a beautiful description of how<br>sometimes things come back around he's I<br>think well far from me to describe what<br>he's talked to us about because he's<br>really communicated very eloquently to<br>us but it's really about taking these<br>snapshots and thinking very clearly<br>about what he's doing and I think to me<br>Peter's real sort of the magic that he<br>has is the ability to communicate and to<br>put his research within the bigger<br>context and not just a some time and<br>many of us who are biochemists think<br>about pathways and a binds the activate<br>see and I know I've stood here and given<br>a talk like that and far more of you<br>went to sleep and that talk and so and<br>so it's not that there is not the good<br>things that there's also not a sort of<br>an important thing to discover but this<br>ability that Peter has to to see the<br>greater vision and connect his research<br>I think it comes through both in his<br>communication and his grant writing and<br>his paper writing and this this<br>afternoon when I was looking up a few<br>things to say I got out his recent paper<br>in Nature communications and read<br>through some of that it's really a very<br>nice introduction to a field that I<br>don't know about and it the discussion<br>puts the work nicely in context and I<br>think you look at that goes right back<br>and references Darwin's work and then<br>many some cases from the 60s and 70s<br>so really describing how a sort of a<br>scientific story builds on previous<br>literature and it's really a very great<br>skill and I think he capito has won<br>numerous awards for his communication<br>and I think you will all see why these<br>have been given so I think we've really<br>seen a snapshot of Peters our research<br>but I really just want to comment that<br>the biochemistry Department is very<br>proud to count him amongst our number<br>he's a very inspirational person to have<br>on a staff and always with ideas and we<br>can see tonight he's got a list of<br>things that Vernon needs to buy them or<br>maybe Holland's budget of have to come<br>in for some of these he's never without<br>thought or a challenge thinking about<br>the next step and so this is a great<br>thing to have in a person sometimes a<br>little sort of directing and the right<br>direction is required but it's always<br>great to have new ideas a university<br>wouldn't be a university without someone<br>pushing the boundaries and thinking<br>about the new technologies and how we<br>might apply that and actually their<br>image of that embryo developing was<br>supercool so I really think Vernon<br>should by pieter one of those animals<br>and I think Harlan should pray the<br>depreciation but I don't want the<br>depreciation on my budget okay so really<br>I think that covers most of my what I<br>wanted to say oh I also wanted to thank<br>Warren and Peters partly touched on what<br>I was going to say but this afternoon I<br>got out Peters application so<br>biochemistry has very good filing system<br>I think Tina's here and I found Peters<br>application for his<br>in 2002 and so Warren it was they hid<br>then and appointed Peters to his<br>position and Peter wrote a very nice<br>state has included in his application<br>his his research statement about what he<br>was going to do and I have to say he's<br>pretty much doing exactly what he said<br>so although he says he's not really a<br>biochemist he didn't kill any lies in<br>his application he said he was going to<br>work on model systems and look at<br>evolution by looking at developmental<br>pathways he said he was going in his<br>application he was going to apply that<br>to in different ways to in terms of<br>improving the environment and managing<br>pests and risks and so all of that has<br>written in his original application so I<br>think he's been pretty true to form and<br>delivered I guess it far more than you<br>might hope for so fabulous Peter so I<br>guess tonight I congratulate you and<br>it's my privilege to give you a small</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
