on behalf of the University of Vago<br>I would like to warmly welcome everyone<br>who is here this evening to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture for<br>Professor Tony maryman<br>again as I look out on the audience this<br>evening I see members of our academic<br>and professional staff I see members of<br>the general public and I also see a<br>number of very special guests who are<br>here this evening I'd like to um<br>particularly welcome Tony's wife Marilyn<br>who is here his children Cara Jasmine<br>and Crawford who are also here and I<br>think his daughter April sends her<br>apologies because she's on an OG's<br>biology Camp obviously not falling very<br>far from the tree<br>um his mother Charlotte is here with us<br>this evening his in-laws Betty and<br>Graham Hill and his brother and<br>sisterin-law Jeffrey and Rose Hill are<br>here with us as well so on behalf of the<br>University of itago we are particularly<br>delighted that you could join us for<br>this very special<br>occasion now when we were considering<br>Tony's promotion to the rank of<br>Professor um we sought feedback from<br>internationally recognized experts on<br>the significance of his<br>research one referee told us in terms of<br>advancing and leading Practice Dr marman<br>has been a New Zealand Pioneer in<br>chronic disease genetics and has in<br>particular LED research to benefit the<br>health and well-being of Mari and<br>Pacific peoples it is not an<br>exaggeration to say that his sustained<br>focus on understanding diseases that<br>affect Mai and Pacific peoples is<br>genuinely Nation changing<br>as you will soon see Tony has more than<br>lived up to that<br>Accolade on a personal note I have known<br>Professor marman for a very long time we<br>met when we were both members of the<br>University of itago human Ethics<br>Committee now for me one of the things<br>that I value most about Tony is his love<br>for his work and two weeks ago when we<br>celebrated his induction into the<br>Fellowship of the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand um Tony made the following<br>comment ment um during his uh Speech<br>after the award he said I'm really proud<br>to receive this honor but I am also<br>extremely grateful that I get to come to<br>work and do what I love each and every<br>day the University is also happy that<br>you come to work every day Tony and do<br>what you<br>love um but your enthusiasm for<br>everything you do um is very clear to<br>each and every one of us who have had<br>the pleasure of working with you so on<br>behalf of the University of itago I<br>would like to to congratulate you on<br>your very well-earned promotion to<br>professor and I will now call on the<br>dean of the school of biomedical<br>Sciences Professor Vernon Ward to tell<br>us just a little bit more about Tony's<br>atago Welcome everybody it's very<br>pleasing to see you all here this<br>evening with a nice room of a range of<br>biochemists and others of interest um so<br>I have the distinct pleasure of<br>introducing Professor Tony merman to you<br>this evening and giving you a little<br>short introduction he uh was very keen<br>that i' not steal his thunder so I'll<br>attempt not to do so um but I do warn<br>you that if you give me brief um<br>descriptions of what you're going to<br>cover you leave it free to me to decide<br>what I'm going to cover warning to the<br>rest of you so Tony and um got his BSC<br>honors in 1989 and then his PhD in 1993<br>both in the department of biochemistry<br>so he's very much one of our homegrown<br>research stars and he very much is a<br>research star from there he went on to<br>Oxford with professor John Todd and um<br>little source of information as Maryland<br>by the way um some words for that came<br>from Professor John um Todd an<br>independent thinker a very good<br>communicator a hard worker a successful<br>independent researcher and that's what<br>he said 10 years ago and he said<br>actually that still stands and that's<br>probably quite a good<br>Testament Tony has some things to back<br>that up you've heard of about the the F<br>FRS congratulations Tony but he also has<br>the numbers for those that like to count<br>here are some numbers for you I tried to<br>work at how many Publications you got<br>but it changes so fast it's actually<br>quite hard this morning Google Scholar<br>was saying<br>280 probably somewhere near right I<br>suspect looking at them they most of<br>them look pretty darn solid 29<br>Publications 2015 29 Publications<br>20169 already so far this<br>year over 26,000 citations an H index of<br>45 for those that like to count such<br>things 8,000 citations last year alone<br>these are already got close on almost<br>2,000 this year already this is an<br>ongoing<br>performance it's Publications lanet<br>nature reviews Rheumatology arthritis<br>and Rheumatology I'd like to say those<br>are one-offs but those are repeated some<br>of them many times over<br>major funding you name it Tony's done it<br>HSC mden massive commercial funding<br>quite across the spectrum that<br>translational side is clearly there but<br>I think this is something I'm going to<br>follow up just briefly on from our vice<br>Chancellor is that Tony's genuine<br>involvement with people and in<br>particular has work with Mari in Pacific<br>the mar gut Action Group the nio program<br>and many others from a personal<br>perspective he sets on the um School of<br>biomedical Sciences Pacific strategic<br>framework group and there's lots of<br>things he does there and it's not just<br>about his research in particular I've<br>seen how he supports specific students<br>and he actually applies affirmative<br>action in the best possible way it's<br>very um rewarding to watch and I can't<br>do justice to what he does in that area<br>in this time frame so his promotion to<br>Professor is very well deserved and he's<br>going to be giving us this talk this<br>evening about inherited genes and the<br>environment um that which makes us<br>unique so that leads me on to what is he<br>going to talk about without stealing his<br>Thunder you'll be aware that his<br>research expertise is in the area of<br>gout but that he also has an increasing<br>interest around related conditions such<br>as diabetes renal and cardiovascular<br>disease that is group studies the<br>genetics components and their<br>interaction with the environment and I<br>think that's the key of where Tony's<br>research sits his goal what he's trying<br>to achieve is around the area of<br>precision medicine and by that that's<br>the personalizing Medical Treatments so<br>it's about your genetic makeup it's<br>getting the right thing for you and<br>that's a really laudable goal and as he<br>said don't steal my thunder but what he<br>was pray to concede is that his<br>presentation will include a review of<br>his journey I won't say from what date<br>I'll let him decide if he wants to tell<br>you that it'll be interspersed with<br>science that he hopes you will find<br>interesting and he will focus upon gout<br>as his presentation develops and so I<br>better not say anymore well I will be<br>stealing your thunder so with that I'd<br>like to invite Professor marman to<br>well um thank you very very much for um<br>those wonderful introductions and um<br>everyone and I see so many familiar<br>faces out there it's lovely to see you<br>all um and I am especially honored that<br>um that Haren can be here to introduce<br>me it's it's a real privilege I'm very<br>very honored by that thank you very much<br>um so this this presentation today is as<br>um Vernon said is going to be um<br>describing my journey and I do want to<br>um throughout it I will be continually<br>acknowledging people important people in<br>in my life and in my career and so in a<br>way um rugby is the analogy of life for<br>me and um here we see Ben Smith scoring<br>a try but we acknowledge that he's<br>scoring a try because of the hard<br>incredibly hard work of this teammates<br>and I think that's how I feel um I also<br>have to acknowledge um the health not<br>have to but I am going to acknowledge oh<br>here's you better take a<br>Jasmine um but the health research<br>Council continual funding from the<br>health research Council has been so<br>important to um help maintain career and<br>funding I also acknowledge the<br>University of atago and Department of<br>biochemistry and I just wanted to say a<br>um word about the University of atago in<br>that um we're a large institution in a<br>relatively small town so that means as<br>you have relationships with your<br>colleagues within the university those<br>relationships are cemented very very<br>often by other connections okay so you<br>have um you can you build good<br>relationships based on reciprocity and<br>trust and and I think that makes the<br>University of atago and biochemistry a<br>great place to work and I have been at<br>the University since I started here in<br>1986 so the you know a word for that is<br>faka Tanga um and I think that um<br>describes the University of ATO very<br>well and that's something that will be<br>very difficult to replicate in larger<br>cities um can I please invite Marilyn to<br>so before um I I talk a lot about um<br>genetics you actually need a lesson in<br>genetics so this is<br>genetics 101 and and I apologize for<br>people who have seen this before but I<br>want to use this little group of ballet<br>dancers who come and so this is my way<br>of acknowledging my wife but but she's<br>going to help you guys put my daughter<br>um so we're just a show of ha you get to<br>vote once and we'll start with the girl<br>on your left so voting for the girl on<br>your<br>left nope second<br>leftt<br>one third leftt smattering of hands um<br>third<br>right oh I see M hesitantly putting his<br>hand up and and the one on the right<br>okay so you guys are geneticists and<br>what you have done is correctly picked<br>my daughter so Cara sitting here the one<br>on the right and and you picked her um<br>because you judged her height as being<br>the<br>shortest all right so you can go and sit<br>down<br>normally normally<br>normally when I do this I don't have my<br>um um assistance from Maryland so people<br>we tend to have a split between a third<br>from the left and and Cara on the on the<br>right there but what that illustrates is<br>genetics we know that height is genetic<br>everybody knows that um and what we know<br>from genetic studies is that 80% of the<br>reason why these girls are all the same<br>age roughly um all living in dened this<br>was the early 2000s differ in height is<br>because of inher genetic variant so your<br>genes explain why you are shorter or<br>taller than your um<br>peers but that's not to say that<br>environment isn't important at all<br>because what environment does if you<br>imagine that these girls were living um<br>200 years ago in East London they would<br>be shorter on average all of them<br>shorter but there would still be the<br>greater variation and they would be<br>shorter because of issues like poor<br>nutrients um vitamin D deficiency Etc<br>but they would still had the same<br>genetically um determined differences in<br>height or similar genetically determined<br>differences in height so it's height and<br>and and we also now know that um the<br>genes for height there's hundreds of<br>genes known for height so this scenario<br>plays out in gout it plays out in<br>obesity the Obesity epidemic roughly 50<br>to 60% of the reason why some people are<br>heavier than others is because of genes<br>but we know that the environment is<br>modulating the average weight okay so<br>environment is important it modulates<br>the<br>average so genes are we we have within<br>us about 20 a half thousand genes and<br>they're contained on chromosomes made of<br>DNA and these genes make the proteins um<br>that do the work in the body and a<br>couple of good examples are incin and<br>keratin which most people will um<br>understand<br>um illustrating how important DNA is if<br>we go so here's your chromosomes if we<br>go down to the bottom here we've got the<br>X and the Y chromosome so the difference<br>in that that difference in DNA makes a<br>difference between men and women okay<br>genetically determined just illustrating<br>the importance of um<br>genes what make um drives the<br>differences between us so we have um the<br>the your chromosomes are made up of DNA<br>okay so here's a um Helix here<br>a pair of earrings that um that a<br>geneticist might give to his wife but<br>instead I<br>um I gave Marilyn something even better<br>which was a genetic test at 23 and me<br>for her birthday a few years<br>ago and she really really hated it it<br>went down like a lead<br>balloon it wasn't a good choice I<br>but anyway these changes we have about 3<br>and A2 billion base pairs in our genome<br>and within those um 3 and a half billion<br>base pairs we now know that in the<br>entire population of the world there are<br>tens if not hundreds of millions of<br>genetic changes and these genetic<br>changes if they fall or influence how<br>these proteins work explain the<br>differences between us um and here is<br>I'm just reiterating in a bunch of<br>conditions that um the amount of<br>heritability and heritability is that<br>80% figure 80% of the reason why some<br>people are taller than others is due to<br>genes URC acid levels which I'm going to<br>talk about in the context of gut later<br>on are 60% heritable type 2 diabetes and<br>obesity roughly 50% type 1 diabetes 80%<br>I'm going to talk a little about type 1<br>diabetes and schizophrenia 80% heritable<br>so genetics do play a strong role in in<br>our<br>makeup okay so I just want to um put<br>this up here that just give you I was<br>born and and it you were entitled to say<br>1968 and because I did give you that<br>information and this is Mom there and<br>myself as a young baby um and dad who<br>was a presbyterian Minister who died<br>some years ago um but in the mans at<br>POA near near<br>Gore after two or three years um we went<br>to Herbert to live and this is me now<br>with my young all my younger brothers<br>and<br>sisters and eventually shifted to dened<br>when I was seven so I've lived in denan<br>most of my life and and here we are all<br>a bit taller but we were never going to<br>get incredibly<br>tall I went to King's high school and I<br>had fun um trolling through the<br>cupboards to find my reports and um I<br>also found a lot of Christmas presents<br>and things sorry Marilyn but um we<br>hidden them but here's on the left hand<br>side is a report when I was in form<br>three or year nine as a 13-year-old it<br>was great um you can see I got an A+ an<br>excellent result fully up to the level<br>of expected of him and the teacher was<br>Ross gallanders and on the um left hand<br>side is the same teacher but me is a<br>seventh former in biology um DD D and D<br>um assessment is based solely on I I<br>can't I can't remember this solely<br>on the scientific report and<br>investigative work Taken part most of<br>the term to<br>date and my observation of how<br>investigations were carried out Tony's<br>report was 7 days late was rather<br>superficial with many<br>gaps um and that's biology and you now<br>I'm doing biology but um this is in the<br>seventh form yearbook you know how you<br>get your peers to make comments about<br>you you'll get a<br>um<br>idea<br>that there was a um probably an inverse<br>another interest in my life at that<br>point which was inversely correlated to<br>biology but nevertheless I got<br>University entrance and I was um<br>probably better at maths um was my best<br>subject at at at high school and<br>certainly starting University and I um<br>came and did first year in 1986 four<br>papers um one of them was economics<br>which um I hope there's no Economist<br>economists here but I found it horribly<br>boring and I really hated it and I never<br>even set the exam at the end of the year<br>um my first year at at vity was sort of<br>a carryon of the seventh of seventh form<br>a little bit so I could not get admitted<br>to any honors programs once I'd sort of<br>grown um started to grow up a bit and<br>get more engaged so that leftt<br>biochemistry is the only honors project<br>open to me after my second<br>year so it really was by default I did<br>biochemistry but I loved it a great<br>subject um I I love biochemistry and<br>very very much enjoyed it and ended up<br>um doing my honors project with MV who's<br>just there and MV I acknowledge MV very<br>important first Mentor for me and I<br>always remember um turning up in my<br>first day in the lab and I um woke up we<br>lived in a flatten Castle Street and I<br>got up in the morning read the paper<br>enjoyed the sunshine came in at 10:00<br>and MV ripped me to shreds about that to<br>you got to be here at 9:00 on the dot<br>starting on time and those are the sort<br>of things that um are very important so<br>I acknowledge that and also explain that<br>um<br>my my this is the CIS this is one of the<br>really Scrappy looking pictures coming<br>out of it it didn't work at all my<br>honest thesis it never worked at all and<br>I found out later it's because I'd<br>forgotten to this is for the scientists<br>amongst us forgotten to denat the<br>southern blocks um which is actually<br>um and then I went on with um Ian as Ian<br>here yeah Ian um Professor Ian Lemont um<br>to do a um in in a thoroughly enjoyable<br>PhD where I was looking at the um<br>this uh molecule called pdin and<br>pseudomonas orosa is a bacteria that is<br>particularly um that that can be<br>infectious particularly for people with<br>cystic fibrosis and the bacteria make<br>and secrete this molecule to collate<br>iron from the from the environment and<br>bring it back inside and here is um some<br>of my work um sequencing a couple of<br>genes involved in making this particular<br>um molecule and that was using old<br>technology and I calculated if we Ed<br>that technology to sequence a genome<br>today we can sequence a human genome in<br>a matter of hours we use that technology<br>it would take thousands of years it<br>would have taken me thousands of years<br>it's great that the technology is has<br>come<br>on during that time um I married Marilyn<br>um we were examples of child Brides like<br>bride and<br>groom and and that's dad marrying us<br>there and um over the years we've had<br>four<br>children the photo meets Cara's approval<br>so Cara here April who's at camp and uh<br>Jasmine and Crawford and apra just<br>always stands on tiptoes for photo she's<br>really not tall and um<br>Cara but the um but children are very<br>important they're great levelers they<br>keep your feet firmly on the ground and<br>it's also very use um interesting to<br>think about when children are growing up<br>the um impact of the environment on um<br>how we turn out very very thoughtful<br>thing to do think about so um went to<br>Oxford in 1994<br>and that this was a paper published by<br>my supervisor the professor John Todd in<br>in 1991 and I presented this at Journal<br>club and Ian said oh John I went um he<br>he he know he's know knows John Todd<br>Professor Lemont in Lemont knows John<br>Todd personally and um he said they went<br>to they did undergraduate at Ed<br>Edinburgh together and he told me a<br>story about John throwing Billy John was<br>a bouncer as a student but he threw<br>Billy Connelly out of the nightclub once<br>so it gives you an idea of the<br>incredible character John is so um I<br>also got this interest in um genetics of<br>diabetes um type one because Marilyn got<br>type 1 diabetes when she was 15 months<br>of age which was very unusual um in the<br>early '70s so it was intriguing to me is<br>why did she get diabetes what was it<br>genetics environment and that started my<br>interest in<br>genetics<br>um it it was a wonderful um four years<br>at Oxford with a um great teacher John<br>he was a real character um Marilyn has<br>always worked in she worked in in Ian's<br>lab as well she's a technician research<br>assistant and she also worked in John's<br>lab and I always remember um John<br>rushing out of his office one day just<br>about knocking Marilyn over and then<br>saying ah Tony he's Irish um I just<br>hopefully I didn't make your wife<br>pregnant<br>there and we um had a very good friend<br>Cara um rainbow who<br>who um worked in the lab and she told us<br>later that she used to get to work early<br>and if John was there she would just go<br>and hide in the toilet somebody else not<br>not that John's John's a bad person he's<br>just a a really intense character but<br>incredibly um bright incredibly bright<br>and wonderful to be taught by him so<br>this is we use genetics and without<br>going into any the genetics in any great<br>detail I found I found this Locust for<br>type type 1 diabetes in um on chromosome<br>18 basically spent four years working on<br>this particular um region of DNA and and<br>this region of DNA contains hundreds of<br>genes so this technique at the time was<br>a technique where you study families who<br>have more than one person with the<br>particular condition so people with um<br>two affected children um but it as it<br>turned out it was um now that we now<br>realize that there are hundreds of genes<br>in any particular um condition like<br>diabetes it wasn't the best way to go<br>was very difficult to um go from that to<br>actually identifying the<br>gene um so I came back to the Department<br>of biochemistry in<br>1998 um and before I describe into gout<br>I just want to acknowledge some people<br>um firstly mentors and and and Tony reev<br>he couldn't be here tonight he's in<br>Australia it's an important Mentor um<br>John heighton is I don't know if John's<br>here but he's a rheumatologist in um<br>based at the hospital just retiring now<br>and he played an important role in<br>mentoring me including um he also<br>mentored these two people here who I'll<br>mention in a minute and Warren Tate who<br>I who who was an important mentor and I<br>also um when I came back for me um so on<br>the left are two key collaborators and<br>we have<br>um published 50 papers over 50 papers<br>between us so Nicola Del Beth and is is<br>is a um extremely extremely talented<br>clinical researcher from um or skur so<br>in the way in in her efficiency and<br>intelligence and Professor Lisa stamp is<br>a is another rheumatologist she's at the<br>University of atago Christ Church um so<br>the we took a better approach for<br>genetics where we take people with<br>whatever condition so gout people<br>without gout and you compare the<br>frequency of genes between your cases<br>and your controls which is a standard<br>epidemiological approach I came back and<br>worked in rheumatoid arthritis um<br>because rheumatoid arthritis is another<br>form of autoimmune disease so I shifted<br>from type 1 diabetes to rheumatoid<br>arthritis but um Nicola arrived back she<br>had spent time in Oxford and she was<br>mentored by John arrived back in Oakland<br>and around about 2002 2003 and at every<br>Rheumatology New Zealand rheumatology<br>conference for a couple of years she' be<br>in my ear you've got to do gout Tony<br>you've got to do gout Tony you've got to<br>do gout Tony So eventually I gave in and<br>switched into gout um which um never<br>ever<br>regretted I'd like to um put the slide<br>up just to brag about New Zealand's um<br>um prominence and gout research<br>worldwide so if you look on the right<br>hand side here's Nica Del Bith she is um<br>the international expert in gout and<br>here um institutions University of<br>Oakland said second University of tago<br>third so we do really punch above our<br>weight as a country and as an<br>institution both Oakland and tago in<br>researching gout and the reason for that<br>which will become we'll get into shortly<br>is because gout has always been um an<br>issue typically in Mari um early on and<br>that that attracted a lot of um English<br>rum British rheumatologists to come to<br>New Zealand you know the first one<br>arrived 100 years ago and they were<br>noting the high prevalence of gout and<br>noting also so that this is weird<br>because we always thought gout was a<br>rich man's disease and it carried on<br>attracting these clinical researchers um<br>to New Zealand and it's been carried on<br>by people like John height and and<br>Nicola and<br>Lisa and another bunch of<br>acknowledgements um and I'm<br>acknowledging here senior colleagues of<br>mine who have been really important in<br>in um getting to where I am and so at<br>the top is Phil Wilcox is Phil<br>here where oh Phil C Phil um so Phil's a<br>um and is is a good friend of mine and<br>and a colleague and he's a statistical<br>geneticist and he also um is a very is a<br>very important mentor and leader in Mari<br>genomics um<br>progressing um translation of of<br>genomics to to impact in Mari<br>communities in New Zealand so he's a<br>national leader of that Mick is Mick<br>here uh really tecknowledge mck cuz he's<br>really really bright<br>um and um he he's played an enormous<br>role together with Phil in this um<br>virtual Institute of statistical<br>genetics now based at the University of<br>atago and getting<br>um the helping my group get those skills<br>needed for um statistical genetics and<br>particularly analysis of large data sets<br>it's not a trivial thing so he's helped<br>to trct and train um people who who are<br>brought these skills into my group and<br>in and and trained other people in my<br>group it's been mck has been critical um<br>you know great great guy in the<br>department of biochemistry his melee and<br>too po so I'm not going to talk about<br>the research with melee but we have a<br>project with the Pacific trust ataro<br>that's ongoing where we're looking at<br>the um health and well-being of Pacific<br>teenagers living in<br>denen um the this is Jenny har hinm<br>Marsh from Pro H I'm not specifically<br>going to talk about this project but<br>it's been an incredibly rewarding<br>project over 10 years and it was<br>instigated by the late doctor partini<br>Nat I always remember um and he was a<br>really important Mentor for me in<br>getting the project going up the coast<br>and I always remember um chatting to him<br>the first time on the phone and I wasn't<br>too sure about the process here so I<br>suggested pet come down and we can<br>discuss things and come up with a memo<br>and and agreements and things like that<br>he no no you just get up here and I'll<br>take you around and we'll get this thing<br>on the road so he was very practical um<br>and down here theana from the PO POA<br>community group so po POA is a island a<br>cook Island but way in the Northwest and<br>we're doing a um a project that's<br>similar in concept to this one up here<br>um B he's based in mangery so these<br>people have been who are highly who I<br>regard very highly have been very<br>important and I acknowledge them so why<br>do we want to identify genes and<br>sometime quite often get asked this<br>question there are a number of<br>reasons um a primary reason is that if<br>you find a gene that's inv that's that's<br>associated with a particular condition<br>because you have inherited that genetic<br>variant at Birth at sorry at conception<br>youve been exposed to what it does and<br>the pathways that operates in the<br>biological Pathways that operates in<br>since you were conceived so you know<br>that V variant is causal of disease and<br>the pathway it operates in is causal of<br>disease so it gives you something to<br>Target you know whether by um looking at<br>how it interacts with the environment or<br>making drugs so that's um probably the<br>primary and most important reason for<br>genetics is that we increase our<br>understanding and that gives better<br>opportunities for interventions on the<br>right here um genetics could be used in<br>prediction and precision medicine um it<br>was called personalized medicine in 2008<br>but now it's called Precision medicine<br>and I'll briefly mention this again at<br>the end so it's got certainly promise<br>here<br>um G understanding the relationship<br>between genes and environment important<br>and I'll talk about that later but one<br>thing that we really um didn't<br>appreciate when we started is that it<br>Des stigmatizes okay so particularly in<br>gout and gout is a disease that's um<br>people are ridiculed of about because<br>it's seen as a disease that's brought on<br>by overc consumption and that's just not<br>the case and this this ridicule actually<br>means particularly in um you know in<br>Mari and and Pacific communities that<br>people are ashamed of it so to be<br>able to stand up in front of a group of<br>Mari men and tell them talk talk to them<br>about genetics and um how no it's not<br>because you're booing all all the time<br>or anything like that your genetics are<br>a big part of you getting gout and you<br>can you always see the light bulbs come<br>on and these these men are quite<br>grateful to hear that and it's part of<br>and helps engage them engage with<br>medical care which is the pretty much<br>the only way that will treat their or<br>gout um I just want to put this one up<br>and this is probably as complicated as<br>it gets but you know you'll be thinking<br>well we've got environment you know if<br>we if we've got um<br>you know people with with a condition do<br>do we focus on the environment do we<br>focus on the genes or do we do both and<br>this um is so the fto gene is a is one<br>of the largest genes in weight in<br>obesity and um it's interesting to<br>compare its effect which is on the right<br>to the effect from this Interventional<br>study so this study um involved<br>intervening in um with with young<br>families and and intervening and<br>teaching um parents ways of preventing<br>their children getting overweight any<br>intervention worked okay on average um<br>this is it's an Australian study on<br>average children who were in The<br>intervention had a BMI so B body mass<br>index which is a measure of weight of<br>about4 units lower than those who<br>weren't intervened but this intervention<br>was intensive and then when they<br>withdrew the intervention you can see um<br>the groups joined up so the intervention<br>worked but like a lot of interventions<br>it's really hard to sustain so it's a<br>challenge um intervention studies but if<br>we look at the fto gene so here's um<br>people with the um this is a bunch of<br>kids um Amazonian children and here's<br>their weight BMI on this this bit here<br>and and traced over time the children in<br>the with the black line inherited the<br>version of the gene that as associated<br>with increased weight and you can see<br>that right from when they started<br>there's this consistent difference um<br>between the two groups and at the age of<br>well in 2012 when I think they were 11<br>years old or something from<br>memory the the the average difference is<br>04 so it has a similar effect to this<br>intervention but because they're exposed<br>to it from birth it's consistent so<br>therefore what another approach to um to<br>deal with one approach there's got to be<br>many many approaches to dealing with<br>obesity is to understand what this Gene<br>is doing and try and replicate the fto<br>effect um in the sorry this is a<br>protective group so in other words what<br>is a gene doing intervene there and get<br>this weight of the heavier children down<br>to the the CH the the the lighter<br>children but I think I'd just like to<br>put that up just to illustrate you know<br>the here's a an intervention effect a<br>genetic effect they're both sort of<br>similar they both um you know<br>interventions need to be done absolutely<br>but let's also pursue the biology the<br>biomedical science to understand the<br>biology behind weight this I'm not going<br>to talk about weight<br>anymore so gout is a form of arthritis<br>um it's caused by higher levels of uric<br>acid and humans are unique in having<br>higher levels of uric acid and what's<br>happened over human evolution over many<br>millions of years is that the gene that<br>normally clears uric acid in other<br>species the gene called uric acid that<br>degrades it has been um knocked out by<br>um a series of mutations and these<br>mutations have clearly been selected for<br>so therefore uric acid higher levels of<br>uric acid had a selective advantage and<br>we can hypothesize that that is because<br>uric acid is a um a picture of uric acid<br>up there is a is a potent antioxidant<br>and May and we also know know it has<br>some brain protective um qualities as<br>well so maybe that one factor in um<br>human brain Evolution but these are just<br>theories and now these days we we now<br>know that uric<br>acid the the one thing that it does<br>cause is G so you get higher levels of<br>uric acid in your joints in your blood<br>and then when the levels get high enough<br>the uric acid crystallizes in your<br>joints and that's what the immune system<br>is a very um painful attack on um and<br>here's data from New Zealand and this is<br>um prevalence of gout so this is percent<br>of the adult population and in different<br>age groups and the top is men and we<br>know that men get um roughly fourfold<br>more men get G than women um women get G<br>but particularly postmenopause and<br>that's a reflection of the um hormonal<br>effect so female hormones protect from<br>gout um but particularly here if you<br>look in these men the um Mari men um<br>getting who are older have an incredibly<br>High rate of gout you know 40 to 45% in<br>this small group are having gout so that<br>does will have an impact and and in<br>Pacific men as<br>well um and we know the reason for this<br>is that Mari and Pacific people in other<br>words Polynesian people have inherently<br>higher uric acid levels and that's<br>natural and these um levels have been<br>measured even when in in by in Prior the<br>epidemiologist many decades ago in<br>islands like Po poer where the levels<br>were high even then so it's not<br>necessarily related to the modern<br>environment having higher uric acid<br>levels and there prevalence of gout the<br>other important thing is that it's one<br>of the metabolic diseases that co-occurs<br>with um diabetes kidney and heart<br>disease amongst others and we really<br>don't know what those relationships are<br>is gout driving these other diseases or<br>are these other diseases driving out or<br>is it a bit of both and that's one of<br>the focus fosy if you like of my um of<br>our researchers to understand that but<br>that's um those results will come in the<br>following in upcoming years we hope um<br>if so gout will build up um sorry uric<br>acid levels will build up you'll get<br>crystals in your joints and then if the<br>gal is not treated you get the um some<br>quite severe buildup of of uric acid<br>into lumps called TPI and this man here<br>he's a quick Island man has lumps um all<br>through his fingers so it's clearly um<br>disabling for him and if these lumps are<br>not dealt with it'll create permanent<br>erosions in his fingers so he'll be<br>permanently disabled and these are all<br>um pictures from Nica who's um Nicola<br>Del Beth who who has a really strong um<br>research interest and skills and and<br>imaging um and here's the latest ones<br>where you can see the these are in the<br>toes so um gout normally happens in the<br>toes first and if it carries on it will<br>spread to other joints so the big toe<br>you can see the toey and buildup of<br>crystal in the big toes of this<br>person it's and I see hel's up there so<br>this is um um work from hel Buckle<br>Professor hel Buckle from the Department<br>of anatomy here at atago she's a<br>um completely escaped me she is she she<br>looks at a<br>Paleo archaeologist is that right you<br>can just Shout It<br>Out Anthropologist of course sorry I<br>just escaped me<br>where um where is hel she was sitting up<br>there before she shifted I would have<br>found her<br>earlier um but anyway so we see gout and<br>pre- westernized Polynesia and these are<br>bones that um hel studied from Tuma<br>which is um and these bones are 1500<br>about 2,000 over 2,000 years old and<br>they're from the um progenitor<br>Polynesian culture the Lita culture Tuma<br>and venatu and we can see here that<br>these holes in the bone here here are<br>all extremely characteristic of the<br>effect of those toei so Pacific people<br>Polynesian people were getting gout<br>2,000 years ago and we also see similar<br>in um in walbar again from hel's work<br>where um she's W bar and Mari the first<br>immigrants to um New Zealand see the<br>same thing and also in Bones um<br>excavated when ockland airport and from<br>manger when ockland Airport runway was<br>extended um some years ago so this<br>emphasizes the need for medical<br>approaches in gout because no lifestyle<br>intervention we get if they were getting<br>gout Mari and Pacific people pre-<br>westernized no lifestyle interfection is<br>going to work the impact is horrific<br>sometimes and you know I will won't<br>dwell too long on this and this is<br>research done by Karen Lindsay in um<br>Oakland but it's really really intensely<br>painful such that people get really<br>frantic about dealing with it<br>and that research led to development um<br>forming of the mai G Action Group which<br>is a group of um researchers clinicians<br>GPS pharmacists Public Health set up in<br>by the Count's mono dhb and I'm a member<br>of that group in 2008 to try and um um<br>work for better outcomes of Mari with<br>gout and we have um there is a five<br>strand responsiveness plan we're<br>research is part of it and um one of my<br>roles within the group is to organize<br>these out and gout who we've done five<br>we've hold them at marai but the main<br>focus at these is to get the um<br>professionals health professionals who<br>interact with patients along and inform<br>them of the latest research in in gout<br>management um you know people like<br>Clinic nurses and Pharmacists and then<br>they translate that knowledge those<br>words into words that um patients can um<br>understand so this is a um overview of<br>what happens in gout so you you get high<br>levels of uric acid and the primary<br>reason for that is underere excretion of<br>uric acid in the kidneys so the kidneys<br>like to keep uric acid as I said before<br>generally uric acid is a good thing um<br>we know genetics are important there we<br>have a lot of doubts about diet playing<br>a role in generating high levels of uric<br>acid and alopurinol is a very common<br>cheap drug that can prevent the buildup<br>of uric acid in the blood um you get<br>hyperemia the here the um immune cells<br>binding to the crystals and you get a um<br>GTO extremely painful gout attack and<br>where we think diet is playing a role is<br>it's triggering these gout attacks and<br>people who already set up have crystals<br>in their<br>joints um this is work done by Tanya<br>Flynn is Tanya here oh it's right up the<br>back um we um we we ask people who take<br>part in our study what triggers your G<br>and she analyzed the results as part of<br>her<br>PhD um she was fllying she's t m now<br>right right um but she what you found<br>the common triggers are seafood and fish<br>well established alcohol red meat but<br>Tomatoes were another trigger and this<br>had never been reported before and you<br>also will note that sugary drinks are a<br>common trigger as well I'll come back to<br>that later um so this is a picture of<br>what of um uric acid crystals and immune<br>cells interacting with them these are<br>immune cells called monocytes so they<br>sort of play around this guy's playing<br>around with it but in general in this<br>particular individual they're not too<br>interested and you can predict that in<br>this person they didn't there wasn't an<br>inflammatory response perhaps this<br>person had genes that just stopped the<br>um the immune cells actually instigating<br>that gout attack whereas in this person<br>you'll see it's a bit<br>different in the cells from this person<br>so here's a one of these immune cells<br>it's engulfing a uric acid Crystal<br>interacting with it there another one<br>coming to have a look<br>cruising<br>around<br>um he or she is very<br>interested um and here's one who's<br>dragging around some<br>crystals and and all through this<br>they're um secreting um molecules that<br>promote gout so this one look at all<br>those gout um immune molecules there<br>that are going to promote gout so we can<br>predict that this person is going to<br>have a gout attack you can see the the<br>immune system has been activated um and<br>triggers work by well I won't go through<br>that slide but the triggers work by<br>um promoting that that um that response<br>that immune response you saw in the<br>second video so it's just they're an<br>extra signal to the cells to go into<br>that immune response we don't know how<br>the dietary thing um factors influence<br>or or cause the triggering we have<br>suspicion that it may be through um<br>metabolism say for instance alcohol is<br>metabolized in the liver but it produces<br>bad fat um called vldl and we think that<br>that bad fat is involved in the trigger<br>and triggering but we're um still<br>investigating that genetics so this is a<br>um a primary uh approach a genomewide<br>Association study and this was done by<br>an international group and they found so<br>what what happens here these are the 22<br>chromosomes all the genes in the genome<br>are simultaneously scanned in a really<br>large group of people 110 000 for genes<br>associated with gout uh with uric acid<br>here okay and and this was published in<br>2013 28 you can see them popping up<br>their genes throughout the genome that<br>in itself doesn't mean anything until<br>you start looking at what those genes do<br>and um those genes emphasize that most<br>of those stronger genes are actually<br>involved and excreting uric acid in the<br>urine okay they they work in the kidney<br>and here's a um a cartoon of the of a<br>kidney a part of the kidney so your<br>urine is filtered out from this side to<br>this side but what happens is uric acid<br>is filled it out then it's taken up<br>again because we know that uric acid is<br>beneficial so humans have also developed<br>the ability to keep as much uric acid as<br>possible in their in their blood so it's<br>brought up again and all of these genes<br>most of them are genetically<br>associated with uric acid levels and no<br>also risk factors for gout which is<br>entirely predictable a genetic a genetic<br>variant that that controls U acid levels<br>will also be expected to be um a risk<br>factor for gout and we showed that in<br>this particular paper<br>here one of the um challenges for doing<br>these studies you saw<br>110,000 um people in that particular<br>study an international study is that we<br>don't have those numbers in gout yet um<br>so this is part of what I do is we lead<br>international national and intern<br>recruitment revolves a lot of<br>collaboration lots of travel um so I I'm<br>usually away last year Maryland to um<br>total up was away 79 nights she sent<br>that in a very grumpy text um as I was<br>returning from my last trip but it it<br>it's necessary for this work so we<br>recruit through the European Crystal<br>Network um in Europe throughout New<br>Zealand and Australia um not so much in<br>Australia and in the states<br>I'm I'm involved in this network here<br>the that that does recruitment and idea<br>biosciences which is a company that we<br>um we've they've shared DNA samples with<br>us from people with gout so we have<br>actually done our first genomewide<br>Association study in gout and it's not<br>published yet but in 6,000 people of<br>European ancestry it emphasizes the<br>importance of uric acid so all of these<br>genes that we've found are the same ones<br>that are involved in controlling acid<br>levels so we didn't find any involved in<br>the inflammation yet but we really need<br>a larger sample size s aiming for 18,000<br>we've done a genomite Association study<br>in Mari and Pacific people and it's very<br>interesting in that if you look here the<br>two big genes are slc29 and abcg2 but<br>slc29 doesn't appear to be popping up in<br>Mari and Pacific just abcg2 so that's<br>pointing towards differences in um<br>control of uric acid and gout between<br>Europeans and Mari and Pacific<br>people how do we find so what what we<br>really wanted to focus on is finding out<br>more about gout and Mari and pafic<br>people the pro one of the problems is is<br>that we don't have information about the<br>background genome variation in Maran<br>Pacific yet and that's something that<br>people like f and myself are working to<br>address<br>um so we do know that the the the<br>genetic variants that are present in<br>Europeans um and ass associate with gout<br>playing a role in gout and and Mari and<br>Pacific are at a higher prevalence in<br>Mari and Pacific but we do have a fairly<br>good suspicion that that there are<br>Marian Pacific specific variants um and<br>but studying that is hampered by a lack<br>of Marian Pacific whole genome<br>information so our stop get solution is<br>to resequence and go and specifically<br>look at these genes um in Mari and<br>Pacific and we've done that and 200<br>people with and without gout and we very<br>recently had um the first paper accepted<br>for this um AR an arthritis and<br>Rheumatology just last week um and we<br>found a new Gene that that plays a role<br>in gam Mari and Pacific but doesn't in<br>Europeans it's one of these um genes<br>involved in excreting uric acid and the<br>same picture I showed you before I've<br>circled it um it's interesting it<br>increases the risk of gout and males<br>only but really interestingly we found a<br>second genetic variation in the gene<br>that was specific to people of Western<br>Polynesia ancestry so that's Samoa Tonga<br>mu and TOA and this variant it's less<br>common but it's quite high risk for gout<br>reduces the ability of abcc4 to excrete<br>uric acid and that when I mentioned<br>Western polan what one of the other<br>things that we have to account for in<br>our genetic studies is we can't use<br>ethnic constructs so Mari and Pacific<br>because we now know that there are<br>genetic differences and here um we can<br>see this looking<br>the entire Genome of a bunch of<br>population groups there Africans<br>Europeans Asians so your entire genome<br>information can determine your<br>ancestry I mean here is Western<br>Polynesian so songa TOA being separated<br>from East Polynesian um that's New<br>Zealand Mari and kiland Mari and<br>Hawaiian and and tahan um so this is<br>another thing that we have to account<br>for in our genetic studies that and and<br>as we translate this to the clinic that<br>there will also be differen between<br>Western and Eastern Polynesian people in<br>genetics of gout and presumably um<br>genetic basis of other um diseases so I<br>just like to finish off now um I don't<br>know how long have I<br>got okay all<br>right thank you there's not too much to<br>go um just finish off by talking about<br>environment and as I said before the<br>environment increases the penetrance of<br>a population pool of risk VAR what that<br>means is is that we have genetic<br>variance that predisposes and it's<br>easier to think about this in the<br>context of obesity for example and what<br>the environment does and we live in an<br>obesogenic environment um you know bad<br>food supply less exercise and probably<br>other things as well that just increases<br>our gen that predispose us to getting<br>obese to being allowing us to become<br>obese but it's important to sort of also<br>understand that these risk variants are<br>a product of millions of years of<br>homonid and human evolution and you will<br>have seen that from how we've humans got<br>high uric acid levels by U the uricase<br>gene being disabled over millions of<br>years of evolution but also for eating<br>we uh program to eat we do it<br>unconsciously okay in the same way the<br>Sixx drive for example it's unconscious<br>but it's presumably genetically there<br>and it's a product of millions of years<br>of<br>evolution so coming to the modern day<br>it's interesting that when we put some<br>of these genes with environmental<br>exposures we see some interesting things<br>happen I just want to briefly tell you a<br>story about what this means this is a<br>so-called non-additive interaction or a<br>gene by environment interaction and<br>here's one example and um if you want to<br>understand how that happens I'll tell<br>you a story about Cara and April and<br>their cousin Philippa um these girls are<br>all the order of 8 and 10 and<br>individually they're manageable right<br>some more manageable than others um by<br>themselves um but they played on the<br>neighbor's trampoline um one day and I<br>suddenly heard<br>screaming which I took no notice of of<br>course um was 50 M 100 met away but when<br>April the most mild manner to Jee if you<br>want to think of her like that came in<br>um she grabbed a knife out of the drawer<br>and said I am going to go and stab them<br>um so I intervened right I thought I had<br>to too but what that demonstrates is<br>that you have these individual people<br>who are you know you know pretty well<br>but you put them together and you get<br>these completely unpredictable results<br>and that's the same here<br>um so the lrp2 gene is particularly<br>important in Mari and Pacific and here's<br>the two genotypes if you like people are<br>positive for the T or negative for the<br>te and um we can compare split people<br>into four groups and here's people um<br>and this is an alcohol interaction that<br>have no<br>alcohol compare it to people there um<br>and here's the so on no alcohol you can<br>see here the risk is normalized at one<br>and then they have um the genetic<br>variant and you can see their risk goes<br>up about threefold by getting that<br>genetic variant going from here to here<br>to<br>2.68 on the back here in the T positive<br>you can<br>um you see the<br>effect sorry I'll start I'll go over<br>here into the um T negative the critical<br>thing here is that when people are<br>exposed to<br>alcohol it turns this protective so this<br>is a protective variant here um it's<br>protective compared to here it turns it<br>into a risk variant okay it completely<br>flips Its Behavior so it's an<br>unpredictable non- additive interaction<br>and we want to understand that and and<br>we may be able to use that in<br>unpersonalized or Precision medicine we<br>may we may not we don't really know yet<br>so just a this is the last um couple of<br>slides gckr is a gene that's important<br>in uric acid and G and and here is a<br>picture of um when I lecture this to Mid<br>students which takes an entire lecture<br>it's all compressed into one now I'm I<br>have the lecture here if you want<br>it but I I I don't think so I think I<br>would be<br>um something nasty done to me but when<br>alcohol and fructose or sugar go into<br>the liver they're metabolized and if you<br>receive it in the form of too much<br>alcohol or too much dissolved sugar such<br>in sugary drinks the liver can't handle<br>it and it turns out bad things and<br>particularly bad fat uric acid causes<br>high blood pressure insulin resistance<br>and diabetes and inflammation so that's<br>why sort of alcohol and fructose<br>particularly when sugary drinks are bad<br>and in the case of sugary drinks and<br>alcohol we think that these bad fats<br>then go and help trigger off the G<br>attack but<br>gckr plays a role in here it's a gene<br>that's involved it's called gluc is<br>regulatory protein Gene so it's involved<br>in metabolism sugar and alcohol as it as<br>it happens so we looked at we did a um a<br>gene environment inter interaction with<br>this one as well so here we've got the<br>two genotype groups T negative so this<br>is the reference group and this is the<br>no alcohol and people who are exposed to<br>alcohol that we collect by questioner<br>and you can see um here's in the blue is<br>the effect of the gene so it increases<br>um risk um about 3.5 fold so it's having<br>a decent effect on gout risk but when<br>you um have any alcohol the genetic<br>effect disappears completely so it<br>removes the genetic effect so this Gene<br>is only having an effect in people who<br>don't drink alcohol and what we um think<br>can hypothesize that's happening is that<br>um<br>gckr when there's no alcohol is is<br>determining the rest of the two genetic<br>variants but when you get alcohol it<br>just floods the system such that it's<br>the alcohol that's driving um the<br>generation of of bad fat and triggering<br>gout and that's another example of a of<br>one of these Gene environment and<br>directions and I'm going to miss those<br>um just to finish off by thinking about<br>how your research impacts so here's<br>several ways I think actually<br>undertaking a research project in a<br>community raises awareness and I think<br>that's something that a lot of<br>researchers underappreciate that by<br>doing research talking about it the<br>active doing it improves people's<br>knowledge and that's a positive thing as<br>I said before in genetics new knowledge<br>leads to new intervention opportunities<br>um here's an example of here several<br>years ago um the slc29 gene which has a<br>particularly strong effect in Marian<br>Pacific and there's another um old drug<br>that targets that Gene and the we're<br>able to the genetic information was able<br>to help the mar gout action groups<br>successfully Advocate to farm it for<br>funding of Bin's brone under Section 29<br>um our work and most of this work I<br>haven't actually talked about um our<br>work shows that urate itself does not<br>cause comorbid conditions ur's really a<br>good guy so there's no need clinically<br>to treat people who just have higher U<br>acid levels to get their uric acid<br>levels down only when they get G should<br>they be treated um this work led by Lisa<br>stamp is um is is an example of<br>precision medicine so we've now found<br>that there is a particular genetic<br>variant in this Gene<br>that um predicts people's response to<br>alopurinol so that they've got a<br>particular variant they're likely to<br>have a poor response to alopurinol so we<br>can use that information either to give<br>them a higher starting dose of<br>alopurinol to begin with OR try them on<br>another drug rather than alopurinol and<br>Lisa nicolar and I are talking about how<br>we might design a um project to<br>translate that into the clinic and the<br>other thing um that we've found is that<br>diet plays a very small role in<br>regulating Ur levels compared to gen<br>that's why I don't you know use and it's<br>translated into um using diet as a<br>management tool and gout should not<br>really be used just get people on<br>medicine unless people know what can<br>avoid their triggers so thank you very<br>much and here's a bunch of people to<br>acknowledge um all of Mo hopefully all<br>of my collaborators the international<br>collaborators students past and present<br>um that should be recruiters throughout<br>New Zealand um and certainly every body<br>who has generously shared DNA and other<br>information and just to finish off<br>within the bold red there the um scrum<br>of my research group they're the one<br>that do the hard work and these are um<br>people who have been in the group and<br>here's Tanya she's um transmitted from a<br>Flynn down here now to a major um which<br>is a really cool name actually um have<br>MJ Rell and Marilyn Mandy um Ruth and<br>some of the kushler Murray and Matt and<br>some of these people have been in my<br>group for a large amount of time I shall<br>stop<br>there so tenot tenot tenot CA uh it's<br>been a marvelous um talk and I really<br>have the worst job following on behind<br>Tony who's given us really a very<br>eloquent uh tour through his enthusiasm<br>and I I'm not really sure I can uh add<br>much to the enthusiasm that he brings<br>and why he's really one of our more<br>valuable people and uh and is really<br>just a great person but I'm just going<br>to take a few moments because as I've<br>done in the last we've had the pleasure<br>in the department of several ipl's in<br>the last year and so I have been taken<br>to looking up the files from people's<br>appointments and this this we uh the<br>admin team in the department are very<br>thorough and we have got all kinds of<br>little bits of information and so<br>looking up Tony's file I can see that he<br>started first um interacting with um MB<br>Smith about coming back to Oto in 1996<br>and the very first document that filed<br>is actually an email to Ian Lamont that<br>says has MV got an email address<br>yet and if so I would like to talk to<br>him so I thought that was shows the<br>thoroughness of the fing that we even<br>have these documents um but I think<br>there are two real things that are invol<br>in this initial interactions which<br>really have continued on uh through<br>Tony's uh very long and successful<br>career here at otago um I guess the<br>first things that have struck me is that<br>as the discussions with our mve progress<br>there's a lot of discussion around the<br>financial complexities what kind of<br>appointments people will have Grant<br>referral legal issues funds for<br>technical salaries consumables and I<br>think that's really a theme that's<br>continued every day in the office so<br>every day Tony has well he's had grant<br>funding that supported his large group<br>and I think particularly that red team<br>up there have all been supported on<br>grants PR for a very long time and in<br>fact Tony's salary until 2007 was fully<br>funded by on grants and this is no mean<br>feat in this uh funding environment and<br>so has required and I think his<br>creativity in terms of making dollars<br>stretch was very apparent from the very<br>beginning and I think that's part of<br>what's made him<br>successful um and the other thing that I<br>thought was amusing is in the first<br>email which is also filed in there Tove<br>about um coming back it's and and here I<br>quote that he's looking forward to<br>coming to otago because he wants to do<br>some real biochemistry as he was as he<br>is sick of genotyping and physical<br>mapping and<br>so this is in Tony's email so I was<br>rather surprised by this and I'm not<br>sure that Tony has um really got away<br>from genotyping as he indicated was his<br>desire and I think for that we're very<br>grateful because he has really gone on<br>to make his Mark as a geneticist and<br>that's uh really his great skill that he<br>brought back to New Zealand with him um<br>so really just I think just to end I<br>want to uh highlight really Tony's<br>passion which has been on fine display<br>tonight and his ability and passion for<br>translating His science into the<br>communities into clinical outcomes into<br>making a difference in communities and<br>people's lives and I think this requires<br>these large networks and uh his<br>incredible amount of interactions that<br>he can sustain keeping the being part of<br>consor visiting um Mari and building<br>these connections takes a huge amount of<br>effort and I think for to Tony we really<br>commend him for that and as a otaro he<br>goes and as a biochemist he goes out<br>there makes all these networks and we're<br>very proud of that and I went to talked<br>to Tony this afternoon and I think one<br>of this last paper that he was talking<br>about that's just been accepted in 2017<br>I think if we look at the authors on<br>that it reflects the connected<br>connectedness of Tony and so aside from<br>his group who are a number of the<br>authors there are authors um<br>affiliations include Nati Paro Hora<br>ockland University Mount Si New York and<br>Harvard Medical School and so I think<br>that's really sums up what Tony uh does<br>and the resources that he brings to his<br>problems uh research problem so as on<br>behalf of the department uh Tony is a<br>really an outstanding person to have in<br>our department uh he contributes in many<br>ways uh he's always willing to share his<br>ideas think outside the box<br>and actually embrace other people's<br>ideas and really often very pragmatic<br>and will reach a pragmatic decision<br>which is I think a very important<br>attribute which also has seen his great<br>success so Tony we're proud of you we're<br>pleased that you're one of us and<br>so down on behalf of I think everybody<br>thank you very much and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
