is harleen<br>Hayne and I have the great privilege of<br>being the vice Chancellor here at the<br>University of itago and it is my great<br>pleasure to welcome you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture as I look<br>out tonight um I see the normal cast of<br>characters we've got staff and students<br>from around the university um and we<br>also have members of the general public<br>who are always warmly welcomed um to<br>these inaugural professorial lectures we<br>also have some special visitors here<br>this evening um our Chancellor John Ward<br>um is here as is our former Vice<br>Chancellor Professor sir David skagg but<br>I'd also like to extend a very special<br>welcome to three other guests that we<br>have this evening um Tim's wife Joe and<br>his two sons Tom and Ben who are also<br>here this evening so collectively we are<br>all here tonight to celebrate the<br>appointment of Professor Tim Stokes to<br>the elain Gir chair of general Practice<br>in the department of general practice<br>and Rural Health now it turns out that<br>teaching and research in the area of<br>general practice and Rural health is<br>more important than ever in New Zealand<br>as we are trying to continue to stretch<br>our Healthcare budget by greater<br>Reliance on Primary<br>Care although the World Bank estimates<br>that only<br>14% of new zealanders live in rural<br>areas the World Bank defines rural as a<br>population below<br>30,000 so although most folks in this<br>country actually live in places with a<br>population greater than 30,000 only the<br>top six cities in New Zealand have a<br>population greater than<br>100,000 so what this means for healthare<br>care is that we need to re more heavily<br>on Primary Care not only now but in the<br>future so with that as a backdrop we are<br>incredibly fortunate to have someone<br>with Professor Tim stoke's skills and<br>expertise as part as as part of our<br>faculty of<br>medicine now when we were considering<br>Tim for this position um we sought<br>feedback from internationally recognized<br>experts in his area of work and one of<br>them told us Tim is an exceptional<br>doctor researcher manager and colleague<br>if you were too appoint him you would<br>have a leader who will make a national<br>and international impact on the<br>field I am sure that as you listen to<br>him tonight you will agree that Tim is<br>already fulfilling that promise here at<br>the University of atago so Professor<br>Stokes although you took up your<br>position in<br>2014 I would now like to officially<br>welcome you to the University of atago<br>and we are extremely pleased to have you<br>here I will now call on the D of the<br>denan school of medicine Professor Barry<br>Taylor who will tell us just a bit more<br>aago um thank you very much Haren she<br>haren's beautifully summarized the<br>context right at the moment we are in a<br>time of major change uh and changing<br>systems especially in primary care so<br>it's critical to base uh what happens in<br>the southern region and indeed across<br>the country on the best of what can be<br>sort of pulled together from the<br>international literature so it's osit to<br>actually introduce Tim um he comes to us<br>from the UK uh and he did his<br>undergraduate training uh in Oxford and<br>Then followed on from that um his his<br>his medical training mixture of Oxford<br>and then in his clinical years in<br>Edinburgh so Edinburgh being named very<br>much the same name as denan uh Denon is<br>I think the old name of Edinburgh if you<br>go to Edinburgh you'll see it on the<br>side of the road uh so he's actually<br>just come home so to speak uh to<br>probably slightly better weather I think<br>than Edinburgh uh and uh and but many of<br>the same<br>Traditions um during the course of doing<br>his uh his medical degree he he s inter<br>interspersed it with doing an MA in um<br>uh history of medicine uh focused on uh<br>Victorian um delivery of healthcare<br>which I think we'll hear a bit more<br>about tonight so um that illustrates I<br>guess some of the depth some of his<br>postgraduate activity that we were<br>particularly impressed with in<br>appointing him was his involvement in<br>nice which is the National Institute for<br>clinical Excellence if I remember<br>rightly uh in the UK which is probably<br>the preeminent body and probably across<br>the world in terms of synthesizing<br>evidence into practice uh and and<br>especially in the UK and certainly I<br>always look up nice guidelines uh when<br>I'm looking about a clinical problem or<br>trying to decide uh where the summary of<br>current evidence sits so nice is one of<br>the I guess and being a a director of<br>the medical side of of of that based on<br>I think it was Manchester uh is uh was<br>was one of the key attractions somebody<br>who's actually used to synthesizing all<br>the information into guidelines and<br>actual practice uh and that's really um<br>one of I guess our clear clear goals and<br>appointing him um since arrival he's<br>demonstrated uh active involvement in<br>local processes in particular and<br>National so he's U already involved with<br>pharmac in terms of some funding<br>decisions around various drugs but more<br>important to me locally he's been AC<br>actively involved in the ph and the dhb<br>has led a work stream around around how<br>we respond to Acute Care in the southern<br>region um and as part of the ongoing<br>discussion about how the model of care<br>for Primary Care and how it should feed<br>into a rebuilt denan hospital so there's<br>are a lot of things happening in this<br>particular area at the moment and it's<br>really uh wonderful from my point of<br>view to have somebody with Tims caliber<br>to actually support that whole process<br>which needs all our brains actively<br>involved in so he came with his wife and<br>children all been introduced thank you<br>very much for coming uh and uh has<br>settled into denen I believe really well<br>he spent his first year and a half<br>protected I think from uh head of<br>Department duties so as to establish uh<br>his his research uh activities and now<br>he's doing both both research and active<br>head of Department duties and I've been<br>uh really impressed with working with<br>him during that time so it's really with<br>great pleasure perhaps slightly delayed<br>two and a half years since he actually<br>started but still it's a wonderful<br>occasion to celebrate uh uh actually<br>becoming a professor and demonstrating<br>really the journey that leads to that uh<br>and I'm looking forward to hearing the<br>many bits that will cont have<br>contributed to in fact his journey to<br>the current state I guess I'm even more<br>interested about what will happen in the<br>next 20 years as as as he delivers on<br>the promise of What's led up to to now<br>so now's a point in time thank you very<br>much Tim welcome and uh we look forward<br>in October<br>2013 I made a decision together with my<br>my ADV to from the United Kingdom New<br>Zealand University ofo and to establish<br>it's working now fantastic you haven't<br>missed<br>anything two and a half years on Happily<br>established in St Clair I can honestly<br>say that we are all really pleased we<br>took this huge step I'm very grateful to<br>the university appointments committee<br>for considering that I had big enough<br>feat to fill the vacant shoes of the<br>elain girl professor of general practice<br>here in the needen school of medicine<br>it's a real privilege to have the<br>opportunity to shape the future of<br>academic general Practice in New<br>Zealand I'm also very grateful for the<br>support and encouragement I've received<br>from my colleagues in the department of<br>G prats and Rural Health within the Deon<br>school of medicine and division of<br>Health Sciences and across the wider<br>University I would also like to<br>specifically acknowledge the support of<br>my peers on the University's excellent<br>academic leadership<br>program but above all I need to thank my<br>wife Joe Joe and my two boys for having<br>f that a move to New Zealand would prove<br>to be an enriching experience for all of<br>us and allow us all to continue to grow<br>as a family not just for me to grow as<br>an<br>academic turning now to my lecture I<br>have chosen the somewhat enigmatic title<br>of The Road Less<br>Traveled I shall shortly expand on what<br>this road is and what Adventures I've<br>had along the way but first of all I<br>would like to reflect on a road more<br>traveled at least for medical<br>practitioners which is that of my<br>choosing the medical discipline of<br>general practice as a career we GPS are<br>the Bedrock of Medical Practice in<br>countries such as New Zealand and the UK<br>there are over 4 and a half thousand GPS<br>in New Zealand and we constitute 38% of<br>the medical Workforce all of you in the<br>audience will I trust have a GP and many<br>of you will have recently consulted one<br>for<br>advice when I left Medical School in<br>1989 I knew that I wanted to pursue<br>general practice as a career I saw it as<br>offering an almost unique opportunity to<br>combine diagnosing and managing a wide<br>range of clinical conditions with the<br>opportunity to be able to build up<br>onetoone relationships with patience<br>over time I have worked at GP for over<br>25 years and over that time have<br>practiced in settings as vared as the<br>penines of yire in Lancashire the F of<br>East Anglia and last but not least in in<br>City leer in the East Midlands of<br>England serving a deprived and<br>multi-ethnic<br>population I work to GP at the East cler<br>medical practice for over 10 years and<br>would like to acknowledge the enormous<br>Social Capital the partners and staff<br>put into the practice so it was a beacon<br>of high quality accessible Primary<br>Health Care in a deprived area here in<br>the deep end of of the inner city we<br>practice what has been termed poverty<br>medicine in a recent blog on website a<br>better NHS the London GP Jonathan<br>Tomlinson who perhaps in one of the most<br>deprived districts of London Hackney<br>talks about his struggles practicing<br>this form of<br>medicine the things I struggled with<br>most of the GP were my difficulties in<br>trying to help people with chronic pain<br>anxiety and depression loneliness severe<br>obesity shame self-loading and self harm<br>the consequences of deprivation and<br>adverse childhood experience experiences<br>it wasn't that they weren't also<br>suffering from heart and lung disease<br>and the rest they were to a huge extent<br>it was just that managing these diseases<br>wasn't half as challenging as the rest<br>and most of the time it didn't seem to<br>be the cause of my patients greatest<br>suffering Poverty of course is not just<br>an urban problem I'd like to close my<br>opening reflection on being a GP with a<br>I was working as a long-term locom GP in<br>the fans of East Anglia in the mid<br>1990s visually it was a bleak flat<br>expanse of land and water partially<br>Redeemed by huge watercolor Skies the<br>town I was working in had seen better<br>days the sort of place where no one left<br>and no one came many of the population<br>were or had been agricultural workers<br>and lived in Council Housing State<br>housing to New Zealand term in those<br>days I did Total general practice nine<br>surgery sessions a week Plus on call<br>overnight and a regular weekend on call<br>I was working at 6:00 a.m. on Monday<br>morning I was tired I've been on duy<br>since Saturday morning and had<br>interrupted sleep both nights the caller<br>was the wife of a man in his early 70s<br>he difficulty breathing and from the<br>history appeared to have chronic<br>obstructive pman disease or cipd a<br>chronic lung disease I decided to make a<br>house call to pay patient lived in a<br>council house vastly furnished did a<br>consultation in the sitting room<br>establishing that he did indeed have an<br>infective<br>acation or flare up of his COPD a<br>straightforward medical<br>case as I was listening to his chest<br>however my gaze became fixed on the<br>fireplace it had a large built-in<br>illuminated glass box on all three sides<br>with something moving in it I completed<br>the consultation agreeing a management<br>plan and issuing a prescription I then<br>said to the patient I hope you don't<br>mind my asking but would you mind<br>telling me what you have in the fir<br>place over there he smiled and said hey<br>Iguana me and the wife have loved<br>Billy's company but he's getting too big<br>for the Bo and we can't afford to keep<br>him in<br>there you seem a nice kind daughter<br>Forest I'm sure you can afford to give<br>home rather taken the back by this<br>request to acquire a large green<br>lizard I was lost for words I mumbled<br>something like I think about<br>it and excuse myself suppressing A Smile<br>as I was leaving my pager went off and<br>it was time for another call on ref<br>reflecting on the case with the passage<br>of time it seems to me to have the<br>Bittersweet quality of the film hunt for<br>the Wilder people funny yes but also<br>tinged with sadness managing the patient<br>COPD was straightforward but finding a<br>home for Billy most definitely was not I<br>Billy turning now to the focus of this<br>lecture which is my career as an<br>academic GP as academic GPS are in<br>contrast to both our Hospital academic<br>colleagues and our GP service colleagues<br>a rare species it is indeed A Road Less<br>Traveled in the UK GP academics<br>constitute less than 7% of clinical<br>University academic staff and represent<br>a tiny proportion of the total GP<br>Workforce the same is true in New<br>Zealand less than 0.5% of the GPS in<br>practice in New Zealand are senior<br>academic GPS with there being<br>approximately one senior academic GP per<br>300 service GPS<br>there are a number of reasons for our<br>Rarity but I think a major one is a deep<br>divide between a Primary Health Care<br>Service delivered by independent<br>practitioners work into a small business<br>model and a fully publicly funded<br>Hospital service this divide was created<br>by the medical profession itself in the<br>mid 20th century it's now how time this<br>breached you're also a relatively new<br>academic discipline I'm very proud to h<br>a medical degree from the Eden of the<br>north Edinburgh and one reason for this<br>is that in 1948 Edinburgh established<br>the first funded GP academic Post in the<br>world a visioning professor of social<br>medicine Frank crew recognized that the<br>closure of the public dispensaries at<br>the start of the NHS would mean medical<br>students could no longer be taught in<br>the<br>community together with the GP Dr<br>Richard Scott He established what he<br>termed a laboratory in the community to<br>provide teaching to medical students and<br>for long-term studies of illness within<br>families Scott became the first<br>professor of general Practice in the<br>world in<br>1963 some 20 years later in 1983 atago<br>established the first New Zealand CH<br>general practice kids of endowment by Dr<br>Elaine<br>G this entertaining cover from New<br>Zealand doctor portraying the academic<br>Life as a roller coaster features both<br>the first Al GE professor Professor cell<br>mdock in the front<br>row with the second ler Professor maray<br>tillard sitting on his own on the last<br>seat at the<br>back there's actually therefore space<br>for Murray because we've just appointed<br>a new next to Murray we've just<br>appointed new professor professor Su<br>pullan Professor Primary Healthcare in<br>Wellington to the space to join at the<br>back as you notice I managed to get a<br>second row seat which I'm quite chuffed<br>about as only just arrived in New<br>Zealand<br>in the 50 or years since the edinb chair<br>was established general practice<br>established itself as a core academic<br>discipline within medical Academia<br>academic GPS have made an important<br>contribution in three main areas<br>teaching and learning research and<br>service development Health policy and<br>clinical<br>leadership special ntion needs to be<br>made of the American pediatrician and<br>Storch advocate for Primary healthc Care<br>Dr Barbara Starfield Barbara was an<br>early practitioner of healthc care<br>delivery and organization research and<br>showed that Health Systems with strong<br>Primary Care achieve Better Health<br>outcomes for patients lower costs and<br>greater equity in health our<br>articulation of the four pillars of<br>primary care practice has been usually<br>influential these are first Contact care<br>they need to be able to access and see a<br>generalist practitioner before any<br>referral to a specialist continuity of<br>care the to see the same practitioner or<br>team of practitioners over time who get<br>to know you and your problems<br>comprehensive care to provide a wide<br>range of clinical and preventive<br>services and coordination of care<br>someone needs to hold a ring in terms of<br>planning care and helping people<br>navigate through the health system<br>Barbara's work was utilized in the<br>recent model of a high- performing<br>Primary Care System fit for the 21st<br>century developed by Bodenheimer and<br>colleagues at the University of<br>California San Francisco there are 10<br>building blocks on this slide I'm not<br>going to talk to them all but the key<br>message of this slide is that for high<br>quality Primary Health Care you do need<br>to provide accessible Health Care it<br>needs to be delivered to a defined<br>geographical population and it needs to<br>be comprehensive coordinated and<br>delivered by a team and that's both<br>Medics and non-medical and non-medical<br>people such as practice nurses Nurse<br>Practitioners but above all that team<br>needs to value continuity of care and<br>this should be our vision for New<br>century oops so I have defined A Road<br>Less Traveled that of academic general<br>practice but how did I come to be<br>traveling along it and what Adventures<br>have I had along the way in a moment I<br>will tell you my story and highlight<br>some of my family and mentors who have<br>guided me this is above all the story of<br>agency of an individual charting a path<br>to his inaugural proposal lecture but<br>it's also a story of structure the path<br>I of job was built by a particular set<br>of economic and social conditions and<br>these have frown my sense of self my<br>Consciousness for I like many I suspect<br>in the audience of of a certain age I'm<br>a child at the postwar welfare state the<br>ability to access and benefit from a<br>high from high quality primary secondary<br>and tery education at little and no<br>Financial cost was instrumental in line<br>me to study at three leading UK<br>universities in the 1980s and to develop<br>lecture My Story begins at Victoria<br>Hospital in Blackpool Lancashire in the<br>northwest of England in<br>1963 it very nearly ended there as I was<br>one of two twin boys born prematurely<br>and was not expected to survive but<br>survive I did although the complications<br>almost certainly left me with my hearing<br>impairment I might that as a child I<br>found hearing aids highly stigmatizing<br>and refused to wear them and so given my<br>desire to pass as normal all my early<br>career right up to my last year at<br>Medical School in 1989 was bent to some<br>mon partially death in the land of the<br>living Sorry land of the hearing I<br>should<br>say OB Mi metaphor there I got by with<br>augmenting what hearing I have with lip<br>reading and also by learning to read the<br>room and I you can understand why I<br>never wanted to be a surgeon or an<br>eist I would now like to acknowledge the<br>11 and support of two family members who<br>are not able to be here today my mother<br>Simon my mom is very proud of her two<br>twin Sons never able to go to university<br>herself or spread her wings she has had<br>compensation in seeing her sons achieve<br>both of these things and seen them live<br>a life I am sure that she could have had<br>two had family circumstances been<br>different I'm also very proud of my mom<br>she has a quality that we parents all<br>too rarely have that of unconditional<br>love for her sons the mov New Zealand<br>has come at a great personal cost as I<br>will see my mother perhaps every two<br>years at most but she has been a stor<br>supporter of the move as she sees the<br>benefits for her son daughter-in-law and<br>two<br>grandsons this is my twin brother Simon<br>Simon has been many things to me not<br>least to par of ears and we mingle with<br>the same set of friends at school and at<br>University I a competitive at school I<br>quickly learned the way to come top was<br>not to directly compete with my brother<br>as he always came top in the physical<br>sciences and Mathematics Simon himself<br>has traveled a road that began with<br>studying metalogy and Material Science<br>at Oxford researching semiconductor<br>industry policy at the Massachusetts<br>Institute of Technology and then F into<br>training as an intellectual property<br>lawyer he's lendon solicitor and<br>Authority on Art and copyright law Sam<br>and I attended a direct Grant that's<br>fully state funded grammar school some<br>seven miles Inland from the Lancer Coast<br>Kirkham grammar<br>school Kirkham grammar school or k Jed<br>it was known offered the next on or<br>around academic education being<br>particularly strong in science I decided<br>to embark on a career medicine and in<br>1982 went up to lady Margaret Hall<br>Oxford to read medicine<br>to arrive at Oxford in 1982 as a<br>northern grammar school boy was the<br>opening of a new world on the one hand<br>Oxford together with Cambridge offered<br>an unparalleled intellectual experience<br>on the other that experience was tinly<br>entwined with the English class system<br>for I had moved from an environment in<br>which we had all Tau pretty much the<br>same and in which there had little<br>social distance to one in which accent<br>school and who you knew did matter I was<br>now defined is coming from the north<br>pejoratively pigeon held in those days<br>as being quote a northern chemist<br>unquote at Oxford I became active in<br>labor Party politics and in particular<br>within the university Fabian Society of<br>which I was Treasurer the fabians being<br>the intellectual ring of the labor party<br>we advised a range of established and<br>Rising labor stars to TCH the society<br>and I have F memories of meeting one of<br>New Zealand's brightest political<br>experts the MP for dagam brown gold<br>if I had not studied medicine at<br>University I would have read history<br>aware that Oxford had a welcome unit for<br>the history of medicine a director Dr<br>Charles Webster a letter saying that I<br>was interested in the subject and would<br>like to know what opportunities there<br>were to pursue this A letter quickly<br>came back inviting me to have aing tea<br>at the unit on the Woodstock Road and<br>the rest as they say his history charg<br>in Oxford but not of it he trained a<br>science teacher in Sheffield and had<br>taught chemistry at Sheffield City<br>grammar school before moving into<br>Academia at the University of Leeds he<br>was also a passionate believer in making<br>his historical research accessible to a<br>wider audience through his work with the<br>open University and the work's<br>educational<br>Association through Charles's mentorship<br>and support I took a special option as<br>part of my ba physiological sciences and<br>then secure British Academy funding to<br>intercalate an Mill in the history of<br>medicine at Peter House Cambridge it<br>took me on an intellectual Journey which<br>gave me a different way of looking at<br>the production of medical knowledge and<br>practice than that used by my medicine<br>that of that what that of what<br>sociologists have termed social<br>constructionism it also led to my first<br>research paper a piece of historical<br>research this paper explored the RO of<br>the pathologist surgeon and public<br>health officer John Simon in the<br>Parliamentary campaign to reform the<br>medical profession in mid Victorian<br>England<br>I left OED in 1985 to do my clinical<br>training in Edinburgh and another road L<br>traveled was almost all my compatriots<br>had gone to Oxford Cambridge or London<br>to complete their studies Edinburgh was<br>socially a breath of fresh air with a<br>much more mixed intake of students and I<br>particularly enjoyed the teaching and<br>the training I received in pediatric<br>Psychiatry and general practice it was<br>also edin I experience the hidden<br>curriculum the unintended curriculum<br>that can have powerful effects on<br>student<br>attitudes and it was in the old Ro<br>infirm of Edinburgh that the force of<br>this curriculum was most strongly felt<br>one story will suffice I was on a<br>Saturday morning post tote Ward round as<br>a 40-year student it was my turn to<br>present the patient I had clarked and<br>man his late 60s could see<br>PD I just finished my history the<br>presenting complaint when the consultant<br>the medical school Professor stopped me<br>and said Stokes where does the patient<br>come from<br>gbridge I replied his reply was<br>unexpected he said they're all mad from<br>there next patient<br>please the answer I think is actually a<br>simple one gbridge is the next mining<br>Village in mid lodium with significant<br>pockets of social deprivation the<br>patient was an ex- minor he wasn't mad<br>he was poor and the poor get a very raw<br>I graduated from medur in 1989 did my<br>first house job in surgery in York and<br>met my wife Joe then a student nurse<br>while I worked on the Urology W I can<br>assure you that's been the subject of a<br>few jokes in its<br>time we decided to return back to the<br>north of England and they got a place in<br>a general practice vocational training<br>scheme in West yire at adale General<br>Hospital adale is 40 km Northwest of<br>leads and serves a large geographical<br>area with high Urban deprivation to the<br>Sou<br>in the former Midtown of keatley and the<br>more affluent rural<br>population extending into the Yale's<br>National Park to the north on paper the<br>aale scheme is unremarkable there are<br>dozens of similar schemes based in<br>similar District General hospitals in<br>nor of England alone however the cour<br>organizers certainly recruited people<br>who thought outside the<br>box of the 12 or so of GPS who went to<br>adale in the early '90s for<br>of us became academic GPS three<br>professors and one senior GP educator<br>David pearon on the right impact trained<br>in me at edur this is a quite amazing<br>amazing achievement and to this day I'm<br>not quite sure why that happened but<br>happened it<br>did it was in 1995 that I embarked on a<br>career in general practice and laid the<br>foundations for my ma major research<br>theme implementation research<br>implementation research is a scientific<br>study of methods to promote the<br>systematic up take of clinical research<br>findings and other evidence-based<br>practices into routine practice and<br>hence to improve the quality of healthc<br>care and over the last 20 years I've<br>conducted research across the<br>implementation<br>Spectrum for as this for as this slide<br>shows such research spans all levels of<br>the health system and what happens in<br>the individual Consulting room between<br>GP impatient due to what happens in the<br>GP practice what happens at District<br>Health Board level and lastly what<br>happens at central government<br>level my GP research career did not<br>however start an academic Department of<br>general practice it started as a regist<br>Dr in public health medicine at leester<br>health authority in<br>Leicester I consider that the academic<br>discipline of Public Health through its<br>membership examination and Mes in public<br>health provided a good grounding in the<br>study of the distribution and<br>determinance of howal Rel states in the<br>population what is called epidemiology<br>and in medical statistics it would also<br>give me a broad understanding of how a<br>whole system operates and is connected<br>and last but not least would furnish me<br>with the skills needed to negotiate with<br>and only respect of senior Hospital<br>clinician and Health Service<br>managers I was given as my first task to<br>beef for working with local gen un<br>medicines Consultants to develop new<br>ways of delivering Sexual Health<br>Services across primary and secondary<br>care I utilized this service brief to<br>set up a program of local implementation<br>research in leerer that addressed the<br>inter relationship of gen medicine<br>clinics Family Planning and general<br>practice and developed and implemented a<br>methodology for the development of<br>evidence-based clinical guidelines first<br>Common SE infection gentle pidal<br>infection clinical guidelines in plain<br>English are recommendations of Health<br>practitioners that advise on best<br>practice in the diagnosis investigation<br>and treatment of common clinical<br>conditions and<br>illnesses this local Healthcare quality<br>improvement work also led to the award<br>of my first local research Grant in<br>collaboration with a new lecture in<br>health policy in the department of<br>epidemology and Public Health at the<br>University of leer who just finished the<br>PHD Dr Mary Dixon<br>Woods it was a quota study that explored<br>women's accounts of choosing and using<br>specialist services for sexual health<br>what research is now widely used in<br>medical research and involves a<br>collection analysis interpretation of<br>data that is not e that are not easily<br>reduced to numbers these data relate the<br>social world and the concepts and<br>behaviors of people within it I'll say<br>more about Mary<br>shortly what was also interesting is<br>that school that I developed then I'm<br>still applying today in New Zealand we<br>are currently using similar methods in a<br>health research Council funded<br>partnership Grant with the sou District<br>Health Board to improve craft people<br>with chronic severe chronic objective<br>pulmer disease this dis have now<br>appeared three times in this talk across<br>the southern region the decision to<br>focus on developing clinical guideline<br>methods in the 1990s at a time when such<br>methods were new and<br>experimental they had not yet been taken<br>up by national government agencies gave<br>me a lucky<br>break in October 2001 having just<br>finished the fixed term clinical leip<br>and general Practice in the thads of<br>submitting my PhD my funding had dried<br>up and I was and I was working full-time<br>as an n city GP in Leicester any future<br>pattern Academia looked<br>uncertain it was then that I was<br>approached by my le colleague Professor<br>Richard Baker to apply for National<br>Institute for clinical accellent or Nic<br>as is known funded senior<br>lectureship the task was to set up and<br>collaboration between the University of<br>leer and shefford and the Royal College<br>of general practice the collaboration<br>was to develop clinical guidelines of<br>high relevance to primary care for the<br>NHS Ling and Wales thus began a career<br>that now span research and National<br>profile and Healthcare quality<br>improvement and time clinical practice<br>for this I must thank Richard Baker an<br>academic GP with a passion for quality<br>and healthc care who supported me as I<br>grew into this<br>role KN was set up in 1999 as an<br>independent organization to reduce<br>variation in the availability and<br>quality of NHS treatments and care and<br>is now part of the furniture of the NHS<br>being seen as a leading international<br>organization in healthcare quality I<br>consider 93 achievements from an<br>academic perspective<br>are a normalization of Earth economics<br>in particular coste Effectiveness<br>analysis into decisions about new and<br>existing Technologies such as<br>pharmaceutical development of a strong<br>patient of public involvement and<br>development of a transparent social<br>value judgment<br>framework however when nice was set up<br>in 1999 its future seemed far from<br>certain the aigin ice for the government<br>quango them was 18 months and there was<br>no shortage of Ved interest who wanted<br>to see nice fail<br>when did then labor Health secretary<br>Frank Dobson was asked will it work<br>Dobson replied probably not but we'll<br>have a bloody good try at<br>it thus those who left secure NHS<br>management or academic post to join it<br>in its early years were taking a<br>considerable<br>risk one such person who left the chair<br>at Public Health at St George's medical<br>school to became his clinical and public<br>health director was Professor Little<br>John Peter had in fact trained as the GP<br>before going into public health Peter<br>was a great colleague and Mentor during<br>my time at nice and we both returned to<br>Academia at about the same time and I'm<br>very pleased to be able to collaborate<br>with Peter on a lotous health Grant on<br>assisting the fans of decision making in<br>his own health<br>sector the nice work allowed me to apply<br>my skills on the national stage and the<br>group I led produced a range of clinal<br>guidelines on common mental conditions<br>with high relevance for Primary Care<br>examples include the first integrated<br>public health and Primary Care guidance<br>on<br>Obesity I'm particularly proud of being<br>able to use my soft influencing skills<br>to get the Department of Health to<br>commission nice to develop a guideline<br>antibiotic prescribing for Spiritual<br>tract infections in Primary Care such<br>conditions had a bread and butter of<br>same day appointments in Primary Care<br>coughs colds ear aee and sore throats<br>the guideline was well received in the<br>UK and has recently been launched in New<br>Zealand it's the first guideline to be<br>cont calized for use in New Zealand<br>under an arrangement between nice and an<br>need's best Practice advisery Center led<br>by my predecessor Professor M<br>tillard if anyone thinks National gu<br>clinical guidelines don't change<br>clinical practice look at this<br>Slide the publication in March 2008 of a<br>nice guideline we developed restricting<br>antibiotic use for the prophylaxis or<br>prevention of a heart condition<br>effective endocarditis was followed by<br>high significant reduction of nearly 80%<br>England over time I also became more<br>involved in the implementation of ging<br>recommendations one major program was<br>development of clinical performance<br>measures or indicators for the National<br>Paper performance framework for UK<br>general practice the quality and<br>outcomes framework or qua there was an<br>increasing concern in<br>2012 that one set of indicators which<br>incentivized the routine use of<br>questionnaires to assess the severity of<br>a common mental illness depression when<br>not working as intended I proposed that<br>my ni team should design and conduct<br>systematic review of the evidence for<br>depression indicator<br>set the review demonstrated that the<br>indicators most likely did not improved<br>care and had adversely affected the<br>process by which gp's diagnosed and<br>manag depression the vi view had a major<br>policy Health policy impact it led to<br>the removal of the indicator sat in my<br>national performance framework<br>I think I have said enough about<br>implementation research and nice I'd now<br>like to take you towards the end of my<br>journey and tell you about my other<br>research theme that of Health<br>practitioner patient relations in<br>primary<br>care as I mentioned earlier one of the<br>key defining featur to Primary Care is<br>providing personal care to to the same<br>individuals over time what is called<br>relation relational continuity of care<br>okay out of range of research studies in<br>this field given continuity of care the<br>nature of personal care and difficult<br>dror patient relationships and I want to<br>tell you about one particular piece of<br>Health practitioner patient relation to<br>search I conducted it's my University of<br>luster PhD thesis and I'm proudly<br>wearing my L to academic regalia as I<br>lecture and there's really three reasons<br>for talking about my PhD the first is<br>that I owe it to my wife Joe to do so as<br>she still has memories of the four years<br>she spent as a PhD Widow and i'<br>specifically like to thank her for the<br>patience and many cups of tea made<br>during the right phase when I would hold<br>myself in my study most weekends the<br>arrival of my PhD was also not long<br>followed by the arrival of my firstborn<br>Tom second is is another Road Less<br>Traveled in 1997 a 4year clinical<br>lecture Post in the department of<br>general practice and Primary Care at the<br>University of Lester became vacant and<br>tell that now is the time to step out to<br>Public Health take up my first acad<br>position and follow my mph with a<br>PhD in choosing my PhD topic and<br>approach I felt I had an unique<br>opportunity to address some unfinished<br>intellectual business I got interested<br>in medical sociology while my Cambridge<br>Master's thesis 10 years previously and<br>was Keen to do a PhD using quotative<br>methods that would allow me to learn app<br>plan and develop relevant sociological<br>Theory to my general practice topic of<br>study I was very fortunate in having two<br>supervisors who together were B to make<br>this journey a rare a rare one for<br>medical practitioners a<br>success my GP Supervisor was Dr Bob<br>McKinley a senior lecturing department<br>at the kill University School of<br>Medicine a number of you will remember<br>that I had Bob out here at the<br>University of Vango last year as a<br>William Evans<br>fellow Bob is an excellent clinician<br>medical educator researcher and<br>colleague and this possessed of a clean<br>intellect he also been the best Mentor<br>that I've ever had<br>my SE just of Dr Mary Dixon woods with<br>whom I had collaborated earlier on the<br>sexual health study Mary has a toing<br>intellect commercial such logical theory<br>in a highly accessible Manner and writes<br>better than anyone else I know I was<br>Mary's first PhD<br>student Mary has since had a<br>distinguished career in health quity and<br>safety research which led to appointment<br>to the ram professorship of Health<br>Services Research at the University of<br>Cambridge last year as super supervisors<br>Mary and Bob which you like chalk and<br>cheese my PhD was entitled ending of du<br>patient relationship and investigation<br>into the removal of patients from gp's<br>lists its aim was to obtain a detailed<br>description of the process of removal as<br>perceived by both practitioner and<br>patient and to place removal in The<br>Wider framework of theory in relation to<br>the difficult doctor patient<br>relationship in the series of four<br>papers I published from this work I was<br>able to offer a rich description of<br>removal from the perspective of both GPS<br>and patients and I'm particularly<br>pleased to have been able to use a<br>sociologist Irving goffman's classic<br>work on stigma to help make sense of the<br>patient accounts in the research paper<br>he published in the British medical<br>journal I was also able to make a more<br>General model of why doctors in<br>relationships with patients and make<br>practical recommendations as to how GP<br>practices can better manage such<br>situations last I was able to publish a<br>sociology paper in which we applied the<br>French sociologist PR's theory of<br>practice to my PhD findings my appetite<br>for sociology was now about well and<br>truly<br>cited the final reason I'm talking about<br>my PhD teach today is that it sat the<br>road in the direction of atago my PhD<br>work led me to a paper which Dr Chris J<br>had coord in 2002 on why patients change<br>do change doctors at the University at<br>the D School of Medicine Chris and I<br>started corresponding and I ran a<br>research seminar at the department on<br>our first family visit to to to New<br>Zealand in 2005 Tom at the time was two<br>and a<br>half Ben wasn't<br>here I was stck at the time by what a<br>wonderful University Den Eden was the<br>memory dimmed with the passage of time<br>to be relet when an email about a vacant<br>position of Taro unexpectedly arrived in<br>2013 it's now time to draw this lecture<br>to a close I consider in telling my<br>story I have taken a series of choices I<br>have made in my career choices that at<br>the time I may only have dimly seen and<br>weave them into a narrative with the<br>benefit of<br>hindsight such is one interpretation of<br>the poem which provides the title for<br>this lecture The Road Not Taken by the<br>American poet Robert Frost I'll leave<br>you with its last stza I shall be<br>telling this with a sigh somewhere ages<br>and ages hence two roads diverged in the<br>wood and I I took the one less travel by<br>and that has made all the difference<br>n that is on now good thank you uh my<br>name is Peter krampton I'm the Prov Vice<br>Chan of Health Sciences and also the<br>dean of the atago medical school<br>greetings everyone um it is my pleasure<br>to thank Tim for his<br>exceptional uh inaugural prophecy<br>lecture and also to highlight a few of<br>the key points and maybe draw some<br>insights from his<br>lecture first of all thank you Tim that<br>was really really<br>enjoyable uh ipls give us the<br>opportunity to hear a<br>narrative from the voice of a professor<br>as they help us to understand the<br>pathway that they have traveled or a<br>pathway Less Traveled in Tim's case uh<br>through their career<br>and to weave a story for us and that<br>he's done very well geographically of<br>course he's told us a story which spans<br>uh his Beginnings his growing up the<br>fans Blackpool Lady Lady Margaret Hall<br>The University of edur and many other<br>places including aale and of course all<br>the way to<br>denen but he's also given us insights<br>into his academic Journey uh<br>particularly focusing on implementation<br>research Arch and Healthcare delivery<br>research spanning qualitative and<br>quantitative<br>methodologies which is a significant<br>component of his approach to his<br>academic work and he's touched on<br>numerous and diverse topics uh including<br>antibotic prescribing depression and so<br>on and also he's informed us of his<br>interest in and love of sociological<br>approaches and how he has applied these<br>to topics such as uh aspects of the<br>relationship thank you Tim also for<br>sharing some of your family stories with<br>us so we can understand where you come<br>from as a<br>person we've learned something about<br>your personal journey and also the key<br>inspirational uh figures in your<br>I was delighted to hear the reference to<br>Barbara Starfield I don't know if you<br>know this term but I had the privilege<br>and the pleasure of working with Barbara<br>for a year back in the early 2000s sadly<br>she's passed away<br>now uh but some of your points were so<br>well Illustrated when I was working with<br>her uh she is an intellectual Pioneer<br>particularly in the context of the<br>United States primary healthc care<br>system which is uh generally weak with<br>some highlights of<br>strength and one of the pillars that Tim<br>referred to was comprehensive care and<br>while I was working with her Barbara's<br>very elderly mother was admitted to a<br>hospital with a fractured neophema<br>fractured thigh which is a common uh<br>injury in elderly people and that was<br>duly operated on and fixed and while she<br>was in hospital she had a number of<br>Specialists looking after her in a very<br>fragmented way<br>and one of those Specialists noted that<br>she had a a drop in her blood glucose<br>level one day what she needed was a<br>barley sugar at that point or a sweet<br>cup of tea instead this specialist<br>working in isolation from all the others<br>stuck a needle into her pancreas to<br>check out the the the very unlikely<br>possibility in this 92y old woman of an<br>insulinoma a rare<br>tumor and uh that intervention that<br>investigation killed her she died as a<br>result and this was a a poignant and<br>tragic<br>reminder uh and illustration of<br>Barbara's passion for comprehensive care<br>Care so<br>Tim you are making a tremendous<br>contribution to academic general<br>practice and to Health Systems develop<br>development in New Zealand and we hope<br>you are with us for a very long time for<br>that contribution to mature and develop<br>as New Zealand's health system develops<br>along its own particular pathway the<br>experience and background that you bring<br>to us is tremendously relevant and<br>valuable to us as um we struggle with<br>many of the issues that you've described<br>from a UK<br>perspective so once again<br>congratulations and thank you so much<br>for treating us to such a great IPL I<br>would like like to make a very small<br>presentation now if I could um of our<br>appreciation this this is a traditional<br>presentation that we make at the time of<br>an IPL thank you thank you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
