Inspired by the potential for artificial intelligence he now heads research in this area at the University of Auckland's Bioengineering Institute.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>okay here's baby X waking up and our<br>baby X can see me I can see my<br>expression so we can we can you speak to<br>him oh yeah Dolittle maybe you are yes<br>you are sure look at whatever is going<br>on so I can wave my hand around and<br>she'll follow that around I can play<br>peek-a-boo with it you go Boop<br>we can even abandon maybe explore that<br>you can de-stress the different you know<br>modulators changing here we're getting<br>cortisol release and it's starting to<br>cry and get upset and you can come in in<br>comfort it's okay it's okay it's okay I<br>came back to the University of Auckland<br>to do a project which was very<br>experimental we were trying to make<br>computer system feel unruhe baat ik by<br>giving it sort of emotion giving an<br>expression giving it a real emotion with<br>war with the people interacting with it<br>the types of models that we're using<br>things like how the oculomotor system X<br>for example how the brain drives the<br>eyes to look at things if i zoom in<br>closer we actually see the oculomotor<br>system so here the different least alive<br>which is reacting so in visual stimuli<br>cameras through it goes through the the<br>optic pathway and it goes into the brain<br>stem which fires off particular nuclei<br>which move the eyes around to look at<br>what it's paying attention to so though<br>this whole system which is running live<br>in a using physiological models to<br>basically create that movement in using<br>biologically plausible information<br>processing systems to create the nerve<br>activity to create that these are all<br>based on current theoretical models and<br>how to put all these together we<br>actually had to develop a special<br>language it's kind of like a building<br>block system for creating and<br>interconnected brain models rebuilding a<br>system which can gauge your reactions<br>and in building the appropriate response<br>now that has an enormous potential over<br>a whole range of fields we can look at<br>things like any type of simulation<br>technology like for example so it could<br>be a civil defense emergency so how<br>would you train people to react with a<br>very<br>a person here example things like<br>psychology research because we can build<br>human stimuli which people react with<br>that we can precisely control which you<br>can't do with video or other means this<br>work can create a new type of<br>human-computer interaction technology<br>which can be used essentially build a<br>new media and if we generate that<br>technology here and we have the mobile<br>leading edge and that technology then I<br>think we can revolutionize how people</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
