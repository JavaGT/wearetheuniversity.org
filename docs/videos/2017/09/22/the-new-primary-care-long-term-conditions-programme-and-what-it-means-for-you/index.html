The focus is on standardising care across the District, supporting self-management and improving coordination. We will detail the new programme, share what we have learnt during a testing phase, and particularly consider what it means for secondary, allied health and community services.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>welcome everybody I think we all get<br>going it is three minutes past I'd like<br>you welcome to medical forum and this is<br>will be a very interesting medical forum<br>where we hear some of the changes that<br>are occurring in our health system and<br>so it's my pleasure to introduce three<br>people<br>first of all Stuart barsen who's been<br>supporting the chronic disease<br>management part of the Hoth Southern<br>Health Alliance will be talking followed<br>by Wendy Finley who's the nursing<br>director for well sales and finishing<br>was John Edmunds who's a cardiologist<br>but interested in chronic conditions and<br>talking third and then we hope to have<br>time for some open discussion so welcome<br>to medical forums Stuart you ready to<br>start off thank you thanks Barry<br>and first I want to acknowledge the<br>other members of the long term condition<br>Network who have been part of a journey<br>over the last few years and have all<br>contributed to what you're going to see<br>today and barry included so thanks guys<br>for coming we really appreciate it<br>so some of you will remember that last<br>year we talked about the long term<br>conditions program and set out what we<br>were hoping to do and this year's an<br>update of where we've got and in<br>particular from John later about what it<br>really means for people working more in<br>the secondary and community and allied<br>health so I'm just gonna briefly sort of<br>go over the why so the program is<br>provisionally at the moment called do<br>the right thing and we're definitely<br>looking for a better name so if anyone<br>can come up with a bigger name and do<br>the right thing please sing out because<br>it's starting to embed itself what we're<br>going to go through today just quickly<br>is look at why recap why I've done do<br>the right thing<br>give you some feedback from the general<br>practices that we've been working with<br>we started working with five general<br>practices to test the model of care and<br>then look at again the or Johnson look<br>at that implications which you can do<br>care and I think it's probably worth<br>pointing out here that the kind of the<br>cope up are really of the whole program<br>is around standardization<br>self-management coordination<br>and particularly communication between<br>all parts of the system so I've lifted<br>this from some of you will recognize the<br>primary and community strategy document<br>that Winston young have been consulting<br>on and of course lifted with your<br>permission but we're not doing anything<br>that no one else is thinking about<br>around the rest of the world or indeed<br>in the rest of New Zealand around<br>stratification not when disciplinary<br>teams and working much more and with the<br>community and this is also of course<br>lifted from Vincent Young's a<br>consultation document and it just sort<br>of shows the kind of things that need to<br>be done in the system to create the kind<br>of change that we were in towards and<br>their texts and crosses indicate what's<br>happening and what's not happening in<br>our district and I think what you'll<br>hopefully see today with long term<br>conditions is that is a number of extra<br>texts that we've been involved in so<br>windy it's going to take over from here<br>Thanks at will oh okay yeah thanks okay<br>so hi everyone I'm director nursing at<br>well South is bearing seed and I'm also<br>the chair of the long term munitions<br>network which has been a huge piece of<br>work that we've pulled together over<br>quite a long period of time and we<br>suddenly feel like we're finally getting<br>there we're just really starting to see<br>all of these pieces of the puzzle come<br>together into what we're talking about<br>today so please do feel free to ask some<br>questions I'm sure you'll have lots of<br>Christians we've still got questions in<br>part of what we're doing as user testing<br>and our practices to make sure we're<br>getting to some of that questions<br>answered as we go along the process so<br>this is the picture that we had when we<br>started looking at this we've got a key<br>plus which for some of you who work in<br>general practice it's the long term<br>emissions management model that is<br>currently and will practice and there's<br>about four million dollar spend on that<br>program for the each year<br>and we when we delved into this it was<br>kind of really ad hoc we done was done<br>really well on some practices not so<br>well on others and then<br>kind of a group that did a average kind<br>of job at managing patients with long<br>term conditions and we've got no kind of<br>measurable outcomes so we don't know<br>what the important that said you can<br>practice is what's going to hit them and<br>what what the outcomes for the patient<br>is at the end of it so this is our new<br>approach certainly general practice lead<br>management long term conditions that was<br>kind of the mantra of the network when<br>we first started was that people with<br>long term conditions supported and<br>primary care and close to home with<br>support of a obviously the secondary key<br>chain but the base of the management and<br>commissions needs to happen in the<br>community program includes frail elderly<br>mental health as well as long-term<br>conditions so we've tried to take a<br>quite a holistic approach rather than<br>siloing an offer to diabetes respiratory<br>carrier vascular that's looking at all<br>long term conditions because generally<br>when a patient comes to general practice<br>they come with everything they don't<br>just come up with the diabetes we're<br>wanting to build on patient<br>self-management and improving health<br>literacy and we're really wanting to<br>support young apprentice for the team of<br>people around them so not just relying<br>on the practice nurse and the GP and<br>general practice to support these<br>patients that looking at<br>multidisciplinary teams in the community<br>and how we've got standardized packages<br>of care we've done some risk<br>stratification which we'll talk about a<br>little bit in a minute in some standard<br>funding that supports the different<br>levels of packages here in the community<br>I hope that's making sense yeah so this<br>is the new approach all the patients<br>that are currently on Care Plus program<br>will go through a comprehensive health<br>assessment on the world South fortune so<br>it's taken quite a bit of development it<br>was one of the largest IT projects that<br>I - developer has popped through the<br>portal and at the end of it when the<br>patient goes through that portal they<br>are extracted into a different label a<br>package of care so package 3 is the most<br>complex function down to a zero who<br>those are kind of not really requiring<br>any kind of extra edit and dimension<br>then they would normally get and their<br>doodle practice we have funding link to<br>each level in a standard package of care<br>for each level as well so a person at<br>level 3 you would know if you were<br>dealing with them in the hospital and<br>they were a level 3 that they would have<br>an advance key plan they would hopefully<br>have had a conversation having a<br>conversation around advanced key plan<br>have an acute care plan a personalized<br>key plan and they will have had their<br>comprehensive health assessment done and<br>that the Edit thing for the package 3 as<br>the multidisciplinary team meeting which<br>we're hoping will be across you know<br>sector and so how we're going to do that<br>we wanted to really get some feedback<br>around what would work for clinicians<br>and Hospital particularly new specialist<br>roles in casinos so this is our<br>stratification which I'm sure allows you<br>hit the last meeting we'll have seen and<br>it's no different than any other kind of<br>stratification that is happening around<br>the country I don't like seeing so<br>what's been done so far we had an<br>extensive consultation process we<br>visited all around the district the<br>group of us went round in talk to<br>general practice we've talked<br>respiratory nurses we've talked here at<br>the forum last year about what you know<br>receiving consultation and feedback on<br>this model and then we've gone through<br>and developed it and so we've got the<br>development of the tools which were<br>thoughts about the comprehensive health<br>assessment the rest prediction tool so<br>every patient over 45 has been gone<br>through a risk prediction analysis tool<br>so we have that for each of the<br>practices and obviously the person I ski<br>plan the acute care plan and the<br>advanced care planning all kind of in<br>various different stages of development<br>and we're doing those tools and health<br>ones that there are viewable across the<br>district<br>and across the system in the blend of<br>the partners in health self-assessment<br>we've got Flinders here from Australia<br>training a group of nurses who roll out<br>their trainer trainer to practice nurses<br>in GPS into the future so they're at<br>their training right today they've got<br>two days we're trying to do this work<br>and not in isolation so trying to build<br>on what we've got our thinking and what<br>we're trying to develop through academic<br>acute demand management program with<br>patients with copd we've tried to<br>integrate it with what we've already got<br>going at well South with their long term<br>conditions team and our dismal education<br>self-management education for patients<br>with diabetes so just trying to build on<br>what's already happening and primary<br>care for management long term conditions<br>and then trying to fill the gaps and<br>you'll see there that we're testing in<br>five different sites those sites are<br>across the district so we've got<br>practice in Monaca one on Alex one an<br>Amphicar go into Indonesian who are user<br>testing our tools at the moment and are<br>putting patients through the portal so<br>this is what the risk stratification<br>tool looks like so this gives us details<br>for every practice around the patients<br>obviously I need to use this pointer<br>ething is it showing up yeah so on this<br>side here is that UHI so the practice<br>will see the energized of those patients<br>in can start to look through who they<br>actually are and what their what their<br>issues are at the practice and start to<br>pop those patients through the<br>comprehensive health assessment and it<br>also gives us the breakdown yeah of<br>those that come up was very high those<br>that come up as high and those on her<br>low and also who's already registered on<br>key plus within that group so it gives<br>us quite a bit of information that we<br>haven't had before about our patient<br>groups now I need on a couple of screen<br>shots with comprehensive health<br>assessment<br>this is what our portal looks like that<br>the practices see and so this is kind of<br>the general page in every cultural<br>starts off with this patient and<br>provider and then these boxes across the<br>top change depending on the portal and<br>on this one here for the company's<br>health assessment if someone is actually<br>over 65 in another box of a falls<br>prevention an assessment box pops up<br>there as well so it's just some a quick<br>view of it in each of those drop-down<br>boxes have areas that the the news for<br>the GP can put on their information they<br>can put in and then cover some<br>activities of daily living medication in<br>an each of the boxes government you saw<br>this tool here with action they can do<br>referral to for the medications to a<br>clinical pharmacist or for a clinical<br>pharmacist review or back to the GP the<br>nurse is doing it for a review of<br>communication that looks at their sort<br>of activities and in what they've got<br>supports that they've got at home and in<br>this screen here you can see that we're<br>also trying to include the entire six<br>months for those patients who've had an<br>interest isn't to make sure that we've<br>got a complete picture for general<br>practice and we're looking at those<br>enter eye and to try and alleviate<br>patients having to do an assessment<br>after assessment after assist them and<br>then this is what it comes out with so<br>it's not all of the companies in our<br>assessment I've just done kind of couple<br>of screenshot pages just to give you a<br>taster but certainly not the whole thing<br>and when they've done that comprehensive<br>health assessment Minnie Mouse patient<br>here has come out with a level three<br>stratification of but on the Flinders<br>scale with a high self-management<br>capacity so putting the Flinders to<br>learn kind of indicates to the nurse or<br>the GP who's doing this<br>what that patience level of<br>self-management is and then some of the<br>actions that they've done as part of a<br>sucess month and then this is where the<br>key blends our own health can excel so<br>we're just about to get x-axis to the<br>acute care plan we're still waiting on<br>the advance key plane into still<br>negotiating around the personalized key<br>plane but we really don't want to<br>develop a care plan out of a system view<br>because there's no point in your care<br>plan that started in primary care and<br>you know risks between no specialist<br>can't see it when they come into a<br>school or the physician can't see it<br>when they're in hospital and the same if<br>that start of an Hospital the practice<br>what does this mean for patient so just<br>kind of given a little bit of a case<br>example of what it would have kind of<br>happened for mrs. Smith under the old<br>program and what we hope will happen<br>from mrs. Smith under the new the new<br>whatever it's going to be called long<br>term conditions program we've got a<br>couple of our user testing sites I've<br>got a bit of a challenge or on at the<br>moment is to rename it they really don't<br>like do the right thing so the challenge<br>back to them was okay let's find another<br>name for it<br>and so the Bursley beavering away trying<br>to work out a new name and we've got a<br>few suggestions coming in and so one of<br>them as the well self so there's lots of<br>discussion about what people like around<br>that they get a free lunch if they can<br>get the right name so might give them a<br>little incentive to us so that's<br>hopefully what are all we're hoping and<br>all look like and it's your team okay<br>thank you<br>my job is to try and persuade certainly<br>the hospital clinicians here that this<br>is not just management speak this is not<br>ernst and young fairy dust being<br>sprinkled down on us<br>but actually that this has a very real<br>significance and the significance is as<br>you know real because it is a really<br>very real problem we are going to be<br>overwhelmed by patience unless we make<br>some changes this is a data you all have<br>seen the superior data I'm sure top left<br>is cardiology bottom right is rehab and<br>it's just exponentially going up the<br>numbers are coming into hospital are<br>going up length of stay bed data growing<br>up and we need to make changes and these<br>are the predictions from superior if we<br>can make some reasonably sensible<br>adjustments to how we manage our<br>patients the current work as you've just<br>heard is predominately around risk<br>stratification and that's going on<br>around the world that's from Cheshire<br>America Australia and that's our<br>iteration of it lots and lots of<br>versions around the world as hospital<br>clinicians we need to be aware that this<br>will make a bit of difference but the<br>numbers are stacked against us the<br>admissions are all going to come from<br>the lower levels because that's where<br>all the patients are yes the high level<br>patients are the ones who are most risk<br>and they are in that group highly likely<br>to be readmitted but actually from our<br>workload<br>it's the bulk of a majority of the main<br>lot who will come in also we need to be<br>aware that the conditions which were<br>targeting need to be ones that can be<br>managed in the community the idea of the<br>ambulatory sensitive conditions there's<br>a list from the NHS there's a New<br>Zealand list which I didn't put up here<br>because it was not quite so pretty it<br>was much longer and spread out but<br>essentially is a very similar list of<br>things that we think we can arrange you<br>know working with primary and secondary<br>care we can manage them in the community<br>rather than hospital bed I have a slight<br>issue with perforated also being managed<br>in the community but to me I think these<br>how are we going to do this now the big<br>headline here is none of this<br>is rocket science there's no one gonna<br>get a Nobel Prize out of this but we<br>just need to up our game and do two<br>things better predominantly one is<br>communication and secondaries to get<br>better trust between the secondary care<br>and primary care on the communication<br>front we've got care plans we've<br>mentioned them already but it's<br>something which needs to be<br>significantly expanded we need the<br>chronic care plans to look for the<br>chronic care and how we're going to<br>manage someone over the years the<br>advance care planning tour when we're<br>talking about their death but we also<br>need the acute care plans which are<br>slightly deaf different what are you<br>going to do when that patient becomes<br>acutely unwell acutely dis near acute<br>abdominal pain what are you going to do<br>and that data needs to be available to<br>us and secondary care but it's also got<br>to be available to everyone in the<br>community and that includes CIN John's<br>and I'm aware just now there are some<br>problems with some John's that they are<br>not able to get the acute care plans<br>which have been written so far so<br>unfortunately their reaction is to scoop<br>the patient up and bring them to the<br>emergency department but if we had<br>proper acute care plans visible for<br>everyone we could avoid that I'm a big<br>fan of the idea of virtual meetings as<br>secondary care getting together with<br>primary care doing virtual clinics we<br>don't need to see a patient with long<br>term conditions we don't need to eyeball<br>that patient providing they're being<br>seen regularly by the nursing staff and<br>the GPS as a secondary care physician I<br>don't need to see them but I may well<br>need to be able to give advice and help<br>manage that patient so a lot of these<br>things can be done virtually and my<br>workload can be moved from sitting in a<br>clinic in Dunedin into the community<br>going to work with the GPS looking at<br>the virtual patient the element of<br>discharge of communication is a whole<br>discharging from hospital we know<br>currently that our discharge summaries<br>are more often not pretty poor and we<br>can do an awful lot better and one of a<br>ways of doing that is the idea of<br>discharge bundles of making sure it's<br>essentially just a checklist have we<br>done everything have we documented<br>everything and are we making sure that<br>information is going with the patient<br>with communication with time with effort<br>comes trust and we in secondary care<br>need to trust our colleagues in the<br>community that they will pick up this<br>patient they will go home and they will<br>be seen within X weeks by someone who we<br>understand and we know when we work with<br>and we know there's a consistency of<br>response from that equally so the GPS<br>and the community teams need to have<br>consistency of response from us but if<br>they ask a question either a written<br>letter or an email or whatever<br>communication method we have they know<br>they will get an answer well thought-out<br>reasonably soon and part of the whole<br>virtual meetings and communication is to<br>increase capability in primary care make<br>sure that I don't worry that the<br>patients are going to be left<br>languishing you're not going to be<br>they're going to be under managed that's<br>always one of the concerns and if you<br>look at a lot of the data from the heart<br>failure trials or hypertension trials<br>patients are never quite as aggressively<br>managed in the community and there's a<br>number of reasons behind that and we<br>need to go and work with the guys in<br>primary care and make sure that<br>capability is increased and of course<br>the part of trust we need to trust the<br>patient we need to educate the patient<br>make sure they're aware of what they<br>should be doing and shouldn't be doing<br>and we do need to trust them we need to<br>trust them that they won't go home and<br>drink a whole lot of fluid need to hold<br>their salt if they're on diuretics<br>that's just part of your education<br>process we've already got a good start<br>on this and I'm delighted to see both<br>Tim and Jack here with us this a great<br>start made on the COPD front of getting<br>the care packages of discharge bundles<br>the care packages and beginning to align<br>a lot of these things together now if<br>other services could copy what these<br>guys are doing I think we'd make a<br>massive step forward because it it<br>really is a very good start the final<br>thing to bear in mind though is this is<br>all part of a PDSA cycle and we need to<br>look at what we're doing we need to<br>review what we're doing but we also need<br>to be patient about it one of the<br>concerns I have with a lot of the data<br>that you see is that it<br>three months six months 12 months data<br>and oddly enough in ruling these<br>programs out at 12 months it's not made<br>much difference if data on the right as<br>you look at it as an Australian study<br>beautifully put together in heart<br>failure which showed that having done a<br>very aggressive well put together<br>program it made matters worse it was<br>more expensive in there more<br>hospitalizations my take on that is<br>actually 12 months is just far too<br>premature to be making that call but<br>this is part of a long term project that<br>we need to just alter the way we work to<br>move care from primary a term secondary<br>into primary and importantly move carers<br>from secondary in to primary with with<br>those patients that's all I've got</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
