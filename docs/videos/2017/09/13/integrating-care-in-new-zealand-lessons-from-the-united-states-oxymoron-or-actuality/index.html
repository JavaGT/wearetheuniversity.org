Derek<br>and Marshall Chen I'm not sure if you've<br>met Marshall but everyone's probably<br>familiar with Sarah I'll still introduce<br>you Sarah dear as an associate professor<br>here in the Department of preventive and<br>social medicine where she teaches health<br>systems and public policy and she's also<br>the director of the injury prevention<br>Research Unit Xero's research is focused<br>on patient reported health social<br>service pathways in the experience of<br>patients and the Health System in 2011<br>12 she was a Commonwealth Fund heartless<br>fellow based at the University of<br>Chicago we she examined care integration<br>at remote rural health clinics and<br>community health centers in the u.s. she<br>is a member of the euro crawl scientific<br>committee sits on the executive of Bell<br>cancer New Zealand is on the board of<br>ghupat a larger community mental health<br>respite service provider and as a member<br>of the Community Health Council hence<br>why couldn't remember all of it<br>Marshall turn here is William Evans<br>visiting fellow hosted by the department<br>here at preventive and social medicine<br>he has a Richard Perillo family<br>professor of healthcare ethics at the<br>University of Chicago an expert in<br>health equity general internist and<br>health services researcher with<br>extensive experience and provide and<br>improving the care of vulnerable<br>patients with diabetes and other chronic<br>diseases through the healthcare system<br>and community interventions Marshall is<br>a graduate of Harvard College and the<br>University of California at Saint San<br>Francisco School of Medicine he<br>completed his residency and fellowship<br>training and general internal medicine<br>at Brigham and Women's Hospital Harvard<br>Medical School<br>so the talk today is integrating care<br>amusement lessons from the United<br>takes oxymoron or actuality Sara will be<br>talking first followed by Marshall we'll<br>see if these questions time for<br>questions at the end there may not be<br>but you can always talk to them<br>afterwards thank you<br>thanks very much Trudi and tena koutou<br>katoa we're delighted to be able to talk<br>to you today on integrating care<br>oxymoron or actuality I mean is it even<br>possible for us to learn anything from a<br>system as interesting and complex as the<br>United States today we're going to be<br>looking at integrated care and as that's<br>occurring with the new zealand's<br>healthcare teacher and if not why not<br>and then I'm going to go very briefly<br>through a new zealanders snapshot of and<br>the u.s. health sector focused around<br>the case study of integrated care that I<br>did with Marshall and others when at the<br>University of Chicago focused on rural<br>safety net clinics and then we're going<br>to I'm going to hand over to Marshall<br>and we'll we'll look at the lessons from<br>the us examples of integrated care<br>oh I'm sorry about mean for their effect<br>to hit them so as we all know health<br>systems are very much influenced by the<br>history and the origins of those systems<br>so just to look very briefly you know in<br>New Zealand with the arrival of settlers<br>from the late 1700s through we saw<br>hospitals in the 1840s for just seven<br>years up to the Treaty of Waitangi in<br>this<br>of the hospital that was established in<br>New Plymouth in 1848 and in fact as any<br>of you have been to Pokhara park and the<br>center of New Plymouth and there's part<br>of this original hospital is located<br>just behind the tea kiosk so it's worth<br>visiting if you're if you're ever in New<br>Plymouth then of course one of the most<br>foundational documents in New Zealand's<br>health health system was the Social<br>Security Act I'm introduced under<br>michael joseph savages leadership of the<br>Labour Party back in 1938 in that<br>legislation and saw the core principles<br>for health care in New Zealand which has<br>stolen place today<br>then health care should be a fundamental<br>right that we should be able to easily<br>its excess services and those services<br>should be universally accessible so not<br>just for the wealthy but they shouldn't<br>be barriers the health system should<br>have a preventive rather than a curative<br>focus and that services should be<br>integrated which is the subject of that<br>talk today however is as million of you<br>know that post 1938 we didn't end up<br>with an integrated health care system so<br>general practitioners argued that it was<br>important for them to maintain the<br>independence from a state funded health<br>care center and to remain private<br>business owners and operators and there<br>were several reasons for that decision<br>but one of them was that they actually<br>wanted to be able to care for their<br>patients independently of of government<br>meddling or interference as they saw it<br>but the outcome of it has been<br>we've got different health care<br>providers working in secret systems in<br>New Zealand we've got people working and<br>publicly funded organizations privately<br>funded organizations and we've also got<br>complexities in our small countries<br>health care system according to the<br>services that are located in in primary<br>care services GP clinics Hospital based<br>services and community based services<br>and we have different funding streams to<br>access about this so even though our<br>populations small in our countries small<br>we have quite a complete system that is<br>a legacy of you know that post 1938<br>bargain in cart integrated care measures<br>unintegrated here measures for patients<br>with chronic and complex conditions and<br>often the focus of integrated carers for<br>these complex people with multi mortgage<br>diagnosis but integrated care may also<br>prevent the development of chronic<br>conditions in the first place<br>and may lead to and the timely diagnosis<br>inappropriate intervention for acute<br>onset conditions also so in the next<br>slide I just want to look at what we<br>amino by the term integrated care at<br>least in our talk so Sarah singer and<br>her colleagues from from Harvard<br>developed an integrated care framework<br>which is quite interesting it takes them<br>to account for care coordination ethics<br>as well as the concept of<br>patient-centered care and there were<br>different constructs in the framework<br>which we have used and so I won't go<br>through all of these in detail because<br>time doesn't allow<br>this was a sort of underpinning<br>framework that informed the analysis of<br>the case study so given the known<br>challenges faced by the US can there be<br>any lessons for us here in new zealand<br>is that even possible so we know that<br>the American healthcare system is in the<br>OECD countries and increasing increase<br>in New Zealand and it's 2010<br>so the American systems complex it's<br>very expensive there's also a very in<br>the OECD countries America has the<br>highest out-of-pocket or private and<br>privately funded don't come here to New<br>Zealand down here with a smaller store a<br>significant proportion but a much<br>smaller proportion of our pocket<br>payments funding our healthcare system<br>which in New Zealand has determined<br>around that over 16 billion per year at<br>the moment in terms of issues the New<br>Zealanders in the room will be well<br>aware of it and these issues commonly<br>come up in the media so issues of<br>timeliness of provision of services I<br>mean there's been an awful lot in the<br>media just locally related to the<br>southern th bein challenges that they<br>have been facing lately quality is<br>when things go wrong it's these services<br>so we know there are many many examples<br>of GPS referring their patients into the<br>secondary or to the secondary service<br>and not being able to get their patients<br>into the system or having very lengthy<br>waits for that to happen and we have<br>issues ongoing issues of communication<br>between primary and secondary providers<br>this is not a unique to New Zealand and<br>phenomenon but our electronic healthcare<br>systems there's an awful lot of work<br>being done at the moment to make those<br>connect in a bit away we're beginning to<br>see in the southern health district<br>we're beginning to see and the<br>introduction of of patient portals and<br>greater involvement for patients and<br>health IT as well but we're still a long<br>way away from from a truly integrated<br>health IT system and that leads to<br>problems in terms of patient support and<br>tracking and following patients over<br>time so these are considerable issues<br>that we face in New Zealand we we have a<br>two-tier system so even though a smaller<br>proportion of our health in the South<br>pocket we still have differences in<br>terms of equity of access to services<br>according to whether or not people can<br>pay privately for perhaps diagnostic<br>procedures in the private sector and<br>then going faster it says to the<br>publicly funded system even though our<br>system is it's cheaper than the US<br>healthcare system there are there are<br>particular challenges that we have also<br>into the patient engagement<br>chronic conditions so you can see here<br>that a very high proportion of of New<br>Zealanders in heaven medical homes that<br>are enrolled with the GP practice and a<br>high proportion and as saying that<br>sorry<br>and a low proportion and saying that<br>that satisfied that their health<br>professionals have done these things<br>it's imperative that help them make a<br>treatment plan that they could have<br>commenced and have given clear<br>instructions on substance and we to seek<br>here and in fact the u.s. is doing<br>better then ask them make the speech for<br>patients who are at home and even for<br>patients not enroll so now I'm just<br>going to quickly move to a little<br>snapshot of the case study that I did in<br>the GUI this focus on integrated here<br>and Marshall asked me for a picture of<br>America or New Zealand so this case<br>study was focused on integrative here in<br>rural clinics and the reason for the<br>focus on rural clinics is some of our<br>rural communities here under employment<br>and poverty was was certainly an issue<br>in the States and under insurance and<br>rural communities as well so in America<br>insurance is often attacked to your<br>employer in your employment and so with<br>under underemployment we saw under<br>insurance and these communities are<br>often a very long way away from from<br>secondary health care providers that<br>they<br>so they often face major transportation<br>difficulties but even within their local<br>rural communities people could be living<br>a long long way away from the small town<br>with the primary care clinic has bathed<br>and not have access to don't own a<br>vehicle and there's no public transport<br>for those sorts of issues and lastly<br>just never was known about<br>implementation and strategies for<br>integrated care and rural settings so<br>that was the reason for the study<br>Marshalls going to come back and talk a<br>bit more about the medical home safety<br>net project desert as a whole but safety<br>net clinics are really provided to give<br>health services to the most vulnerable<br>populations and so they're located in<br>particular regions throughout the US<br>including rural areas and so we wanted<br>to look at challenges faced by<br>integrated care right challenges faced<br>in terms of integrating care in rural<br>clinics and the strategies that they use<br>to address this so the first Center that<br>we meet through was the High Plains<br>Community Health Center and you can see<br>here it was it was a terribly long way<br>from Denver it was really a new drive to<br>get there across the high plains of<br>Colorado and the other Garden of God's<br>which if you're ever in that part of the<br>states as well waste of the time but an<br>awfully long way from Dean<br>which was the main search for secondary<br>and certainly tertiary health care for<br>people living in the mouth but the other<br>interesting thing is they very very low<br>median and income and so it was<br>literally a situation of houses with<br>broken windows and doors hanging off the<br>frames and much much underemployment in<br>their community the next place and the<br>case study was OHSU and Nia Oregon and<br>slightly higher and median income but<br>still a community I'm very much affected<br>by decline of the logging industry and<br>other things they lovely<br>East Oregon Medical Associates which was<br>in a little town of bacon City again a<br>very very long way away from Portland<br>Oregon it was a five and a half hour<br>drive to get there so I'm just going to<br>focus now on looking at the different<br>ways in which the safety net clinics<br>configured these services which was<br>quite interesting to me as a musial<br>endure and quite different to how our GP<br>practices are configured here so i'm<br>each of them concern each of the clinics<br>had a slightly different structure but<br>probably some different roles co-located<br>in each clinic to those that we might<br>ordinarily find in our routine primary<br>care facilities here so I'm going to<br>focus mostly on the high plains clinic<br>just in the interest of time each of<br>safety net clinics had really unique and<br>interesting features about them the high<br>plains that was interesting was the<br>entertainment caseload so first and<br>foremost if people were Indies or<br>physicians news practitioners or<br>physician assistants they all had their<br>own independent caseload so at<br>practicing is independent providers so<br>the nurse practitioners were just<br>working and you know following the GPS<br>instructions they were working<br>independently there were a few tablets<br>around there in terms of precision few<br>items that they weren't able to<br>prescribe but by and large they were<br>entirely independent in the clinic was<br>also a team of patient facilitators who<br>received about 18 weeks of training to<br>be able to do a number of tests and<br>support work to help the the providers<br>so when patients came to the clinic they<br>would they would screen the patient's<br>first take any tests or diagnostic they<br>also located a health coach and that was<br>someone who would pick up after the<br>person had seen ER the clinician in peps<br>they want to help with exercise programs<br>or weight loss or needed diabetes<br>support those health coaches in the<br>clinic which would Leos with the patient<br>and set up separate appointments to work<br>with them closely on those<br>shows the health coaches also work<br>closely with the rural community and<br>there was one German and so they set up<br>partnerships with that German for people<br>who were working on weight loss or<br>exercise issues so heavily subsidized AM<br>enrollment fees and programs for those<br>people to go to the German participation<br>manage the all the clinicians in the<br>health coach would take an interns to<br>host a walking route that happened every<br>Saturday morning in the local community<br>and everyone who wanted to would join<br>that walking group and they'd go for a<br>walk together and they also had<br>co-located behavioral health workers<br>just like to read up a quote about that<br>I'm here to offer the piece of<br>integrated care that's the behavioral<br>health side so they can have easy access<br>to somebody if a provider has a patient<br>in their room who's struggling with<br>mental health it's kind of nice having<br>me around so they can actually ask me to<br>meet the patient right then and there my<br>field behavioral health mental health<br>has a horrible stigma unfortunately so<br>it's not what a face with a name rather<br>than just referring them without that<br>face it seems to make people feel a<br>little more comfortable about the idea<br>of mental health it's part of what we<br>call the warm handoff to mental health<br>consultation so there have been an<br>initiative that came from the clinic<br>there was one mental health provider in<br>the small town and people reported a lot<br>of sort of embarrassment or shame<br>crossing the thresholds of that mental<br>health provider so instead they brought<br>the provider and co-located them in the<br>clinic so they're just a range of really<br>really neat initiatives that this remote<br>primary care practice was able<br>the meantime only touching on a few of<br>fun but these patients facilitators had<br>a key role in following up to ensure<br>that patients were able to able to<br>literally get to the hospital<br>appointment that might be in Denver<br>we're able to fund the fuel to be car to<br>get here and if not they they found they<br>liaised with local charities to make<br>that possible here and in the u.s. can<br>struggle with is providers staying in<br>that clinic for a long time so they can<br>be a problem with high turnover of<br>doctors and tended to be people of the<br>community<br>and they stayed there and so they became<br>the Keeney kind of lunch poem to the<br>team so these people might move but<br>these people stayed the same and<br>provided the continuity of patient<br>support so I'm not going to go through<br>all of those strategies without talk to<br>talk to most of them I'm going to now<br>hand over to Marshall for some of the<br>lessons from the ears and just want to<br>acknowledge the colleagues here and in<br>Chicago have been involved in working on<br>on various integrated care projects with<br>us thanks Sara it's sort of like going<br>through memory lane hearing about death<br>the project is very nice and I like the<br>fact that the department of preventive<br>is social medicine for for being my home<br>over the past two months<br>Heather's fellow it's been a great<br>academic home I felt very welcome and<br>appreciate them<br>beer so if Saracen Williams Evans Disney<br>fellow<br>it's really sort of a nice parallel<br>structure here where three years ago I<br>was there as mentor when she was<br>learning about the US healthcare system<br>and now Sierra's my mentor you know<br>learning about New Zealand after system<br>although serie is slightly G referee<br>challenges it was trying to point to the<br>Chicago but I mean the court feels of<br>Kansas and Sarah had a great project but<br>she chose well test your site visits so<br>this is the Colorado area and very<br>beautiful and and that's article that<br>that's tearing it out of the project for<br>mikkel here and see her with American<br>cows so they're like portion of talk<br>will do over three different things<br>we'll talk about two models in Riddick<br>here in the US and their drivers review<br>the evidence base of these models and<br>one underlying themes of who were<br>talking about the importance of thinking<br>about both here transformation and<br>payment of here at the same time and<br>specifically their story about Australia<br>and New Zealand talk about the two key<br>trends and then the two models we'll<br>talk about are the pinch that Michael<br>Holmes will do over other aspects of its<br>theory start to introduce and then<br>something that I think is probably new<br>hearings deal and the template<br>organizations people bit of flavor of<br>that and listen take-home lessons so<br>about two weeks ago it was on a Monday<br>most fortunate that Tracy that one of<br>the key need office here was kind enough<br>to let me have along during more rounds<br>and this was a very kind of perfect it's<br>a very busy morning for her because the<br>that weekend there were a number of<br>admissions and serve a team of the three<br>doctors we're seeing those patients do<br>really well someone for the first time<br>so there's a really hectic at the time<br>and let me tag along<br>and it didn't take long before I begin<br>to realize our pest feeling well am I in<br>New Zealand or the u.s. because it was<br>really saying good even where the<br>patients that were being admitted older<br>adults with multiple chronic diseases<br>many a cognitive impairment many had<br>social challenges they were challenges<br>that the patient's had in terms of the<br>hospital and in the referring region<br>some issues in terms of the GP climate<br>here interface with specialists in for<br>new severe mixed electronic and paper<br>medical records so the patient that they<br>discharged their challenges in terms of<br>what where was it go and that planning<br>process quite a few patients had a<br>variety of social problems and some of<br>them wanted legal problems so you're<br>worrying there's two other sectors and<br>it's complicated a particularly nasty<br>problem both in New Zealand the u.s. is<br>this issue of handoffs I mention for<br>example that there's a lot of new<br>admissions over the weekend and so there<br>was no one on the teams that had<br>actually been one of the doctors that<br>admitted them and so that's nice<br>tightness and this is probably one of<br>the highest-risk periods when it's the<br>handoff and care between different teams<br>of doctors that in this country it's<br>much more for clear reasons and so you<br>see these were all coordination issues<br>integration issues so I'm very similar<br>across the two countries since him<br>officially but I was walking the<br>hospitals they saw that there's the<br>current quality improvement project<br>looking at how do you improve this<br>weekend handover system so just a quick<br>background this terms like a u.s. US<br>care so so like the Zealand there are a<br>lot of small independent physician and<br>group practices like some of the rural<br>areas like for serious or some of the<br>suburban areas we also have a fair<br>number of larger entities so for example<br>so-called managed care plans or<br>integrated delivery systems so these are<br>groups of the physicians hospitals that<br>band together and chart them up with a<br>formal legal structure in which they<br>pull together and in managed care and<br>negotiate contracts with the insurance<br>plans and they often have a variety<br>different types of payment of which one<br>of them is called capitation where<br>something like if somebody select you<br>just a couple words we get out that lump<br>sum money at the beginning and then<br>you're responsible then for allocating<br>that money there's also this constant<br>for the preferred preferred provider<br>network meaning that a different system<br>or game plan might negotiate with a<br>number of providers and hospitals and<br>then select a subset of those providers<br>to be within the network within the plan<br>so that someone who had that particular<br>insurance plan would either have to go<br>to those lists most hospitals or doctors<br>or if they didn't go to those hospitals<br>doing it to pay more in terms of out of<br>pocket so it's also - at least to them<br>issues of like how you banishes health<br>and he says the whole variety tensions<br>that are inherently built into you some<br>of these different models so one is this<br>tension between cost equality so for<br>example if you have a set but you get<br>the beginning well your incentive is to<br>basically try to reduce costs because<br>they you have a set budget but then they<br>come at the cost of quality of care or<br>access so examples pervert a lot of<br>network so you're limiting access you're<br>saying well you want you to go to this<br>set the governor's or this particular<br>hospitals so you're limiting access<br>theory though is that well you know you<br>are trying to get the hospitals and<br>doctor bunch of the clinics who are<br>lower cost or high<br>quality these tensions in terms of<br>trade-offs okay two key trends that are<br>sort of the forefront that are relevant<br>was talking about of integration<br>wouldn't care<br>so first is this shift from so-called<br>fee-for-service payment to you<br>value-based purchasing so this is image<br>to are this sort of like a metaphor we<br>have of like a US healthcare system came<br>at the two canoes passing in the dark or<br>I couldn't find pictures of canoes so I<br>did kayaks here in the minotaur and so<br>is anyone ever been in a situation where<br>you literally have one foot in one boat<br>and another and it'll be bad if the bus<br>is going different directions so if you<br>have and at some point it's very<br>unstable and you're likely to fall and<br>get wet or hurt in a bad way and so the<br>challenge here is that there are two<br>systems of care which are passing in the<br>dark here which have very different<br>incentives so the predominant system for<br>years is the fee-for-service where this<br>is the more I do as a doctor I get paid<br>more so if I see more patients I get<br>more money if I order more tests I get<br>more money if I do more procedures we<br>get more money so they are the incentive<br>is paying for volume that is graphic<br>going down and prevalence and what sort<br>of rising is the so called value-based<br>purchasing where the goal there is<br>that's basically try to incentivize<br>quality so if I give higher quality care<br>with my patient have better outcomes I<br>get more money and what patients have<br>poor quality outcomes and we'll let it<br>to guide this person is the shift from<br>fee-for-service these so-called<br>alternative payment models I mentioned<br>the one of them but like that capitation<br>and they like a little budget pain plan<br>and the two others we'll talk about next<br>are examples<br>alternative payment models the idea with<br>female tenpin losses that in theory they<br>should be more efficient because<br>fee-for-service is very probably the<br>most inefficient system because<br>basically more you weren't yet itself is<br>an example like two years ago there's a<br>major change in the way that the<br>Medicare program for Medicare is the<br>program for people 65 and older which is<br>very powerful because it's such is the<br>last every six people in the US so it<br>has so much market share that whatever<br>menaker does oftentimes then the private<br>marketplace will get sort of follow and<br>so they did two things back two years<br>ago one was that for their fee for<br>service payment their goal was by next<br>year make sure that 90% of that<br>fee-for-service payment was linked to<br>quality it was the shift of value-based<br>person the second thing the thing that<br>you ultimately want to do more of over<br>time is a ship to be called advanced<br>alternative payment models and the goal<br>there is spent by next year they want 50<br>percent of their medical payments to be<br>in this system as opposed to<br>fee-for-service system and again the<br>example we'll talk about are of this<br>type it's not sway they want to go these<br>different models and then certainly this<br>is integration of care and there were<br>two drivers of any rates here in the<br>u.s. so one is clinical there's not the<br>clinical people or they say well you<br>know there's been this rise of the<br>importance of quality of care over the<br>past 25 years or so so it wasn't on the<br>radar screen thirty-four years ago now<br>this much we'll talk about well what is<br>pointed here<br>we mission volunteer how do we create<br>systems that would work well you care so<br>much someone that there are concepts of<br>good care so chronic sure models like<br>whether the big was that something<br>basins execs lie one thing that C<br>reminded me of we're cleaning his<br>presentations that my cereal estimate<br>Northwest part the country up in Oregon<br>and a Washington one that the gods of<br>chronic every thought models got ahead<br>Wagner so somehow Sarah bagel suits and<br>that she was actually what the<br>co-authors on a series paper then less<br>64 solders well what I've talked about<br>patient centered care it's kind of<br>obvious but that language really have it<br>into the u.s. in a big way to what half<br>dozen years ago then obviously being<br>patient the accordion a key of anybody<br>care and then the financial drivers are<br>we just talked about the shift for<br>fee-for-service the dye based person and<br>these little buddies<br>okay so now I do a deeper dive into<br>patient mental homes that Sarah gave a<br>mess intro to so the u.s. the story goes<br>back about 6070 years actually the<br>pediatrician is the channel doctors that<br>were at the forefront and so part of a<br>Peterson's panel are the turn of the us<br>as children with special health care<br>needs so these are children have a<br>variety of physical and developmental<br>and cognitive abilities that make their<br>life challenging and so in some ways<br>that the traditional medical system it<br>was truly medical would fail these<br>children and so they had to come up with<br>these so-called medical homes that were<br>more comprehensive it did a better job<br>of linking health care education illegal<br>services social services that help the<br>children<br>families so we got to have a<br>comprehensive mental home but here is my<br>favorite definition of a potentially<br>that woman alone I'd like them to come a<br>nice qualitative description that gets<br>at the some of the essence of the mental<br>home so they have written houses a<br>family mr. doctor in San Francisco and<br>she's brought that the model combines<br>the core tenets of primary care<br>first protector this continuous<br>comprehensive and coordinated across the<br>continuity with 21st century praxis<br>innovations such as the use of<br>electronic information systems<br>population base management of parental<br>disc and continuous quality improvement<br>so some ways the traditional primary<br>care plus these newfangled ways of the<br>present here so they had further tasks<br>that one important course to this model<br>is a focused on meeting these purposes<br>of patience patience to member serious<br>lack of patience enter this another is<br>payment reform so money's important but<br>can't performed an improves<br>reimbursement the private practices and<br>rewards high performance so if you go<br>now ten years back in the u.s. the<br>alphabet soup up there those are for the<br>major primary care professional<br>societies and they've been together you<br>have these joint principles in the neck<br>with home which when you read them it's<br>quite a bit of overlap with the seven<br>constructs that gets their head from the<br>Sarah singer model and so sometimes you<br>see these visual diagrams where take<br>like each of these different concepts<br>have it as a building block in this this<br>picture of a home with these principles<br>of enhanced access improve safety and<br>quality so if we fast forward to like<br>this year these various standards that<br>in concepts have been a bit over time so<br>this is the most recent edition of NC q8<br>is that the major crediting body for<br>middle homes in the US and so you'll see<br>that the lot of overlap with them the<br>most intend years ago and lot of overlap<br>with Sears specialized but I was late<br>for the white please over time the key<br>based care practice organization so it<br>does quite well with such narrows rural<br>clinic story knowing and managing your<br>patients and cleaning up any resources<br>so again a nice parallel with better<br>world work that Sarah did taste of<br>tenderness a sir nation impoundment the<br>idea of a seamless a provider over time<br>care management patient-centered<br>approaches care coordination so things<br>like the emotional but Dunedin Hospital<br>example in terms of challenges of<br>courting that electrician tracking<br>patients the results over time and in<br>this issue of like having a quality<br>improvement process invention iranian<br>performance it's funny you improve<br>things all the time and measuring how<br>you doing so this all sounds great the<br>reality or abstract i guess but<br>honeycomb mental home when i gets<br>transformed from a place where there may<br>be an abstract concept of being for<br>example a rural clinic that serve<br>visited that's what he gave an example<br>the advanced example that the c revision<br>that she would have three clinics and<br>the complete three plans about a toll 65<br>but in five different states and so how<br>do they make these discussed in their<br>place<br>homes well there was a group of like<br>trainers that basically did not<br>everything the third bullet a lot of<br>variety persistence so this is long<br>distance part of it so stomachs in visit<br>webinars and website resources some was<br>local so each state has its own call<br>coordinator who would then be more local<br>because of like coaching when I'm<br>coaching you could do site visits were<br>actually go to those clinics and then<br>it's the idea of the learning<br>collaborative so based on a state level<br>so that any give a state would have<br>twelve or thirteen of these clinics and<br>they wouldn't meet in person anywhere<br>two to four times a year and also would<br>have a telephone calls where there's a<br>chance that they learn some techniques<br>to share best practices and maybe a<br>support group and over time what usually<br>happens the collective learning<br>collaborative is that maybe in the<br>beginning the trainer's do much of it<br>but over time then as some ways the<br>place become the experts because they<br>they have a fun light experience they<br>you know going through what works what<br>doesn't work so they become the next<br>person to teach each other the website<br>that has no senator train materials<br>there so you know there's not magic that<br>there's sort of a concrete process here<br>a trainer though has to have sort of a<br>model in terms of well what are they<br>going to do insurance willing to teach<br>and so the trance for this one they<br>independently so-called eight change<br>concepts stickers for them here so<br>engaging your leadership and divided all<br>including strategy a lot has to do with<br>like mystic implementation science so<br>what do you need to do it to change any<br>organization<br>the time type of a panel into the<br>Casillas relationship<br>evidence-based care patient centeredness<br>enhanced access care coordination so<br>that was the Eric attempt there so what<br>the results though believe it's a pair<br>of stairs part evaluation where we<br>looked at a whole different variety of<br>evaluation of outcomes so it's not a<br>mixed the quality care outcomes to mix<br>it's not improved some didn't improve<br>overall cost equalization care did not<br>change there was Marcin through the<br>patient experience but whatever one key<br>thing is that where the was benefit it<br>did tend to occur among the sickest<br>highest risk patients someone just makes<br>sense that alpha technique designed an<br>intervention so yep any lost principle<br>that the your your biggest bang a<br>possibility where is the patients who<br>most needed<br>so among the sickest patients there was<br>a decrease in preventable<br>hospitalizations in hospital costs and<br>there was an increase in mission<br>empowerment and activation among racial<br>ethnic minority patients who were fear<br>report health employment to decrease<br>provider job satisfaction in the clinics<br>who had decreased mental home with the<br>ability so the change process itself can<br>be a stressful and challenging them for<br>the fighters and then it's our project<br>if you want to look for the overall<br>issue<br>this is website of this<br>instead of your collaborative it has<br>more information sorry to fruitier that<br>they have a nice website with articles<br>and reviews and the overall literature<br>very similar to the way a specific<br>project quality cost EU ization mixed<br>results in general increased use of GPS<br>or primary providers inconsistent<br>findings less efficient to use the<br>immersive our business hospitalization<br>and the longer practices that - the<br>transformation is thicker than patients<br>the more likely a positive effect the<br>cost savings I'm going to go straight to<br>a cos sometimes be fun to talk about<br>because I don't think he has to make<br>this would countable here so the people<br>who care about it so company resistance<br>what are these these are provider led<br>organizations with strong crime with<br>your base who collectively are<br>accountable for the quality and concept<br>here for a group of patients of<br>population patients spanning the<br>continuity of care meaning spanning<br>inpatient setting outpatient setting<br>public air your payment is linked in to<br>your quality of care and reducing costs<br>and so it assumes that you have<br>something a sophisticated performance<br>measurement system that's got an able<br>you to be able to do better because<br>improving appear at reducing costs so a<br>President Obama's part of this health<br>care legislation like six years ago<br>actually created about some governmental<br>plans to create a cos so the first ones<br>called the Medicare Shared in his plan<br>so and what I'm gonna do in the next few<br>slides show you like different flavors<br>of these cos in a sense the tip of<br>variables that could be<br>some ways like altered if you try to if<br>so much test then what might lead to<br>that that's not temps and again the<br>incentive payments they still guess are<br>basically determined based upon how that<br>you compared to a historical benchmark<br>so if you better terms you save money<br>it's good say something money if you do<br>worse than that badly what will benefit<br>submission they have the so-called<br>tenant models one side it means that you<br>could only benefit so if you have shared<br>savings when the two percent savings you<br>was saying he would share those savings<br>fifty-fifty with the government you<br>pocket half the savings and then you<br>give another head back to government the<br>two sided a lot of you just save more<br>about the sixty percent of the cut the<br>downside was then that there's now two<br>sided risk if you lost money you would<br>have financial penalty where's the first<br>one if you lost money<br>the government pays but you could but<br>you think game money your share the<br>profit was less one fear is that people<br>would say well I'm just going to cut<br>costume you know of quality peer so they<br>were also moving these quality metrics<br>you had to do well on these five to the<br>quality metrics otherwise you wouldn't<br>so here's not a flavor now so in this<br>version you could you know get up to<br>sixty or seventy five percent of the<br>savings so you could potentially gain<br>more to keep your hair respect to them<br>you also be given a so-called<br>population-based payment options so that<br>that's the thief or service payment some<br>of the money would come up front in<br>terms of like on a per beneficiary per<br>patient come out from us we get<br>additional money which would hopefully<br>invest in the infrastructure need to<br>improve care at lower costs for example<br>someone a community health workers so<br>stare missionary nursing live at the<br>role of these health coaches that is<br>traditionally might pay for new US<br>health care system if you had an<br>innovative him ischemic use your money<br>there's a higher help it was in the<br>beginning maybe that we the reduced cost<br>that's an example a fair an example this<br>one you could ask you but pocket also<br>savings if you did well and the<br>additional thing here is that besides<br>those other forms of payment capitation<br>is at it where you get them like an<br>overall global budget and then that<br>organization is named responsible for<br>again the government is trying to get<br>people more more more to this far end in<br>terms of full risk all capitated so<br>that's what they try to give people toys<br>another option just came out is a<br>capital health communities about the<br>idea is that a lot of the outcomes of<br>patients are driven by their social<br>needs especially the Hybris populations<br>so these create more flexible funding<br>streams where you can use some money<br>systems of housing or employment or or<br>urban planning or whatnot<br>so what's the overall results of the<br>literature<br>so a very real issue but if you the<br>bottom line modestly less cost for a cos<br>recruit patient satisfaction sort of<br>like mental homes the gains are seen<br>predominately the high need high cost<br>populations quality of care outcomes<br>mixed in interesting least mcgovern<br>programs still a negative cost to the<br>figure that your programs when you add<br>up the cost of Rena program plus the<br>shared savings they need to share them<br>with the ACO then there's this shoe here<br>of like so I guess some place that the<br>number of key issues need to think about<br>in terms of like designing hopefully<br>good policy because of some ways<br>well-intentioned policies can easily go<br>off the rails here<br>so what tension is potentially creating<br>clinical integration and limiting market<br>power blow any of that you might think<br>about someone needs to know where the<br>more integrated it is the better would<br>be if the doctors well that they've got<br>a coordinated with the hospitals there's<br>one point with like home care well you<br>probably should be able to give more<br>here are better outcomes more<br>efficiencies the danger in one danger is<br>that the more Easter crane is big<br>entities turned a lump of these thinking<br>that that practices in these big<br>entities you see grace there isn't<br>monopoly it's like say like in Tunisian<br>it turns out that well as opposed to<br>these dozens of prejudice you now have<br>to mega a cos that are already in the<br>market well this is the sphere that<br>enough like a monopoly a power and the<br>ability of those entities do they sue<br>raise their rates because they don't<br>have competition<br>interestingly to give an example of how<br>this playoffs is fascinating and then<br>early medic for a CEOs they looked at<br>two different types of organizations<br>once where the physicians were<br>independents and hospitals and those for<br>the hospital those in which hospitals<br>were a very powerful part ACO so it<br>turns out the savings tend to be greater<br>in the ones that were at McKenna penance<br>editions and part of what's happening<br>here is that if you're an independent<br>physician that's not linked to the<br>hospital well if you if you basically<br>prevent the hospitalization you pocket<br>the money I don't totally sure it's the<br>business but save money there say you're<br>a hospital where half of your payment<br>comes from an ACO the capitation you<br>have your money comes from<br>fee-for-service well if you collect some<br>great system that depresses all your<br>hospitalizations you make money on the<br>ACO part but you lose money in terms of<br>your fee-for-service patients that now<br>aren't being that in hospital so strain<br>is the kid to connect passing the dark<br>problem<br>another example is that this question<br>how much risk does they still need to be<br>air tube is a change of behavior so much<br>how much financial risk is necessary to<br>be basically motivate behavior so<br>oregon's or<br>that's it Oregon they have a program<br>which has a whole lot of risk we're all<br>capitation global budget if so you're<br>fully at risk<br>Colorado's PCO program was more like<br>something early once I showed you where<br>it's not full capitation so it's not<br>much about the risk status came out with<br>just a stirs up the results of our<br>similar so all saying that money and<br>risk bearing isn't the full story here<br>Department that is spent like a lot of<br>what we do I think that health care is<br>both in traces of motivation partners<br>like money but a heavy intrinsic<br>motivation part in terms of the vast<br>majority people would healthcare are<br>doing it because they want to this<br>company reasons and so the Colorado<br>program they had a heaviness besides the<br>financial part in terms of the program's<br>did include quality care and that's I<br>think what kills most providers last one<br>there most gives us and end with this<br>cautionary tale but how many of you in<br>that desirous husband brain for people<br>yeah so Brian is a really interesting<br>man he's a fascinating background and<br>he's a very sick person to talk to and<br>so up Sarah and Brian finally invited me<br>to join them what static morning to walk<br>along the beaches you probably will<br>recognize this place it he's come on Bob<br>mold the mold yeah<br>and so intently talking to Brian serious<br>man fact<br>whose pictures and Brian was telling me<br>well in this particular role could be to<br>happen to be rocks for seals like the<br>cub and he said well you know seals can<br>be hard to spot so you see I'm looking<br>at Brian and rise with the straight<br>ahead<br>ammonia's looking at the ground see was<br>just taking pictures happily away what<br>this doesn't show is that like though<br>really of a second later Sarah says<br>Marshall look out if it was just a time<br>sort of leap back and it has to see<br>little leaping at me is that pretty<br>closely which actually actually<br>literally laughs when it happened but I<br>was taking pictures at the end realized<br>like this because it really had effects<br>or said well you know you may have had<br>your introduction with a video a CC<br>system near zeeland the killer seal and<br>so it's sort of a it's an allegory here<br>in metaphors don't let go there are<br>these opportunities that are right in<br>front of us to proof here little cost<br>and more efficient systems but we know<br>they're not even sort of see them and<br>one of the dangers is that these if we<br>don't so take advantage of opportunities<br>they can buy backups that the cost of<br>care will halt any problems or safety<br>problems are are nasty products that<br>make a difference in people's lives but<br>the good news is that well the killer<br>steel can't be caged so there is some<br>hope in terms of making our systems the<br>more integrated<br>according to the Caritas that's it so we</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
