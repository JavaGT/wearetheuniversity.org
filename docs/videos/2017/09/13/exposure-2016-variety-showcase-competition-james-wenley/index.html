titled 'Finding ourselves: New Zealand Theatre's O.E. - Live!'</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>in my PhD research I've been chasing<br>ghosts now let's be clear I'm a theater<br>scholar not a Ghostbuster but future is<br>an ephemeral form each night plays have<br>recreated live to win over the hearts<br>and minds of a new group of people<br>watching them in the theater they exist<br>and then they're gone I've been hunting<br>New Zealand plays that have been<br>performed internationally I've been<br>trying to make sense of the tracers<br>they've left behind to understand the<br>significance of the journeys they've<br>made<br>I've been burrowing through the archives<br>looking at reviews images scripts<br>chasing ghosts but tonight for one night<br>only these plays are coming back to life<br>with the help of these actors we're<br>going to examine how plays have<br>represented our terror to the world and<br>how they've been received by the world<br>in turn this is finding ourselves New<br>Zealand theatres overseas experience<br>live now throughout this country's<br>genetic history there's been a strong<br>pull for New Zealand players to be<br>toured and produced internationally with<br>a relatively small population there's a<br>economic as well as artistic appeal to<br>be seen by a potentially much larger<br>audience than overseas destinations now<br>New Zealand's dramatic development has<br>been defined by an identity crisis and<br>this is especially true New Zealand<br>plays are produced overseas now you<br>might be asking at this point what is<br>New Zealand's most successful play<br>internationally well I have so for you<br>it might surprise you the Rocky Horror<br>Show<br>so there is a statue of rocky creator<br>Richard O'Brien in Hamilton this is very<br>spent his formative teenage years<br>amongst the fishnet stocking in heels<br>can we capture O'Brien's coming-of-age<br>hidden within the show Brad<br>can be seen as analogues of small-town<br>New Zealanders who make sure overseas<br>where they can give themselves over to<br>and experience now Rocky's New Zealand<br>consciousness exists under the surface<br>as an alternative narrative and reading<br>the thing itself can be said to be in a<br>kind of cultural drag okay I've got<br>another option for you ladies nice by<br>Stevenson clear in an endless line of a<br>country-specific strippers ladies night<br>wears its cultural drag so convincingly<br>that audiences would have no idea of its<br>country of origin been stopped pretty<br>with the judges okay cut that here's<br>another option skin sights by Gary<br>Henderson is the most produced New<br>Zealand play where the New Zealand<br>setting has been retained so this is set<br>amongst the South Canterbury plants and<br>in this play rural battlers Tom and<br>Elizabeth reflect on a life spent<br>together and engage in these visceral<br>physical fights as they negotiate their<br>whoo cheering zero will walk home Ishiro<br>a sheep shearer so skin-tight has a<br>number of cues and clues that the<br>knowing local audience can identify and<br>identify with but then national identity<br>itself as a performance a set of<br>assumptions that become naturalized by<br>the very act of repetition this is the<br>feedback loop the self referential<br>markers of identity that the ideal local<br>knowing audience is meant to recognize<br>this their own sheep shearers it<br>includes and it excludes and it<br>resonates differently when placed<br>outside of this country skin type does<br>not change but its audiences do new<br>zealand in the world do see different<br>things now let's travel back further<br>into New Zealand's dramatic past before<br>the 1970s there were a few plays that<br>actually represented New Zealand<br>theatres privilege mostly British<br>scripts and audiences dreamed of the<br>motherland's New Zealand drama was ready<br>to be invented a new group of New<br>Zealand playwrights sent their scripts<br>overseas now one of these was Stella<br>Jones whose 1957 play the tree thank you<br>was first produced in Bristol England it<br>was only once it gained this<br>international legitimacy that it was<br>actually performed in New Zealand so in<br>the tree a young woman Hilda is eager to<br>I don't know when I don't care I'm going<br>so an important aspect of New Zealand<br>identity developed in the tree there is<br>this pulled felt by New Zealanders<br>towards international travel and<br>opportunities so Jones was part of a<br>nationalist movement of playwrights most<br>prominently Bruce Mason now he toured<br>has played the end of the golden wither<br>to the Indra Fringe Festival in 1963 the<br>same year that regular jet services<br>between New Zealand and Britain began<br>which contributed to the concept of the<br>New Zealanders OAE we go overseas to<br>find yourself Mayson identify it we may<br>have to say now Mason's ended the gone<br>where there was the counter-argument to<br>this view however he was still driven by<br>this need for cultural validation for<br>the old culture to approve of the new<br>there's the sense in order that you have<br>an identity it first has to be<br>recognized by others that you possess<br>this one now this proves a problem we're<br>in order for the New Zealand play to be<br>produced overseas it's localized by the<br>international company and the belief<br>versus will make it more relevant to its<br>audiences and therefore do better at the<br>box office let's travel next to 1979 now<br>this was when a New Zealand play opened<br>in London's West End and stayed there<br>for 18 months<br>this was middle-age spread by a prolific<br>New Zealand playwright Roger Hall now in<br>New Zealand this was greeted as a<br>breakthrough work and it concerns itself<br>with infidelity in the Wellington<br>suburbs and a fear taking place between<br>a deputy school principal and a relief<br>teacher however in London's West End the<br>New Zealand play was produced and<br>performed adapted and cultural British<br>drag let's look first at the New Zealand<br>version Judy and Colin who were having<br>via fear and disgust their desire for<br>travel<br>I'm British so for the New Zealanders<br>travel here is a big deal and New<br>Zealand Judy's dear belief the country<br>which speaks to her great desire to get<br>out and bredren it's just across the<br>channel the stakes are lower so<br>middle-aged spread is a commercial<br>cultural adaptation with a colonial<br>premise the British Centre is privileged<br>over commercially and culturally<br>inferior New Zealand's let's go now to<br>2015 and a player was there actually<br>able to experience live generation of<br>seeds now this is a immersive zombies<br>show and I experienced this four times<br>during its run in London and we've got a<br>one of the characters here from the play<br>coming out here now this is a product of<br>globalization and it rejected New<br>Zealand locality and an attempt to enter<br>an international paradise were an<br>endless horde of zombies fence if I can<br>get this guy under control in its own<br>way it repeats the cultural adaptation<br>of ladies night and middle-aged spread<br>and it shows theatre-makers with a<br>global outlook no longer needing to make<br>New Zealand place in order to have their<br>culture of firms but New Zealand out<br>Aotearoa will soon<br>creasing lead abuse identities does have<br>important stories in histories to tell I<br>have found that audiences find ways to<br>relate regardless and actively search<br>for markers of cultural equivalents<br>sittings don't need to be changed just<br>look at skin-tight so after chasing New<br>Zealand theatres ghosts and being chased<br>by new zealand theaters zombies I've<br>come to my conclusion there is value in<br>promoting works with markers of New<br>Zealand Altaria list the globalised<br>zombies completely take over tonight<br>with Trevor with several New Zealand<br>works some that look very different over<br>sea stages some markers travel some<br>remain at home these are the stories of<br>New Zealand theatres Zoey and identity<br>crisis and the struggles of making it<br>internationally and so we close the<br>plays for now until they live again<br>thanks for letting us play thank you<br>very much for that questions<br>thank you for that super entertaining<br>presentation I was just wondering about<br>your methodology and the kind of<br>critical framework that you've used to<br>contextualize this sorry yes so a lot of<br>my research has involved going into the<br>archives and looking at what's actually<br>been kicked in luckily New Zealand's<br>history is actually being pretty well<br>documented so I was able to go to the<br>Hakan in Otago and there's the folders<br>for Roger Hall and playwrights like<br>Robert Lord so I'm taking that because<br>as I said there's only these traces that<br>are left behind and I kind of have to<br>interpret through it and what the live<br>experience was and for the audiences and<br>the different destinations watching<br>these plays and so reviews are an<br>important record and it provides some of<br>the possible responses and that the<br>productions open up and I do look at<br>some different theory so we understand<br>post-colonial theory we're interested in<br>global hybridity or these sorts of<br>things so that's how I'm able to pull it<br>together and hopefully evoke what the<br>actual experience of these plays were<br>like at the time thank you again as<br>really enjoyable do did you find<br>anything further back beyond 1950 did<br>you find any evidence of say even early<br>New Zealand Victorian sort of talking<br>back to the you know how do we answering<br>back to the Empire yeah so these there's<br>a few there's a few cases way way back<br>so there's one the late in the late<br>18-hundreds which toured to Australia<br>and one of its big set pieces was the<br>pink and white terraces eruption so they<br>had this huge spectacle about that but<br>then after that early 1900s there was<br>this play called the wind and the rain<br>and that actually played in the West End<br>for three years and it was also produced<br>in America and was wildly popular so<br>that was by a again in New Zealand<br>playwright who lived in the country was<br>bought up here and<br>he went to Britain to seek his fortune<br>and so he wrote a play about postdoc<br>students or postdoctoral students and<br>Umbra which was you could kind of say<br>was influenced by his own time in<br>Dunedin which obviously has some<br>interesting intersections with Scottish<br>history there so there's this kind of<br>bizarre places which was like can we<br>really claim this in New Zealand's<br>history so when that kind of has been<br>spoken in the Canon they say it's it's<br>the New Zealand play that got away it's<br>the New Zealand play by proxy but again<br>there's this kind of if you want to read<br>it in the you can and it does put a bit<br>of pressure on the people doing that<br>these appearing these performances and<br>sending them overseas how do you what do<br>you feel in a way having do it looked at<br>the research is do you feel that there<br>is among a contemporary is a kind of<br>pressure that they do conform or is<br>there are they reverting or pushing back<br>against it do you see it more wanting to<br>push that New Zealand experience more<br>because I know we don't want to like<br>boys because that's completely British<br>but it does work here I know the links<br>so I feel that complete New Zealand<br>experience can work but what's your<br>opinion with yes so creative do<br>zealand's who do a lot of the funding<br>and for theatre they have a policy which<br>is actively interested in showcasing New<br>Zealand works overseas so they have been<br>I'm doing a lot of work in their area in<br>terms of touring it but this is the kind<br>of the the sanctioned view of what New<br>Zealand identity is so that the shows<br>that they choose to promote overseas and<br>so there's there's ones that go through<br>there and then there's kind of the<br>independence<br>so there is a movement of theater makers<br>who aren't interested in these national<br>issues anymore they do want to make<br>these global stories and so you've got<br>the kind of the government push on one<br>hand versus and other theater makers who<br>are rejecting this so a few years ago<br>and they supported the New Zealand<br>Attenborough season so this was a big<br>push to the inner French to get New<br>Zealand work out and this did kind of<br>reflect a New Zealand Pacifica identity<br>overseas but that isn't actually<br>necessary reflected in the range of<br>works that we see in the mainstream<br>theaters inside the country so that's<br>also a problem as well in terms of is<br>this kind of one thing for overseas and<br>then another thing that's not happening<br>enough within New Zealand's relative<br>experience with the French do you think<br>it is more acceptable now to be overtly<br>New Zealand and I was there the first<br>flight of the conchords performance at<br>the Fringe then in some ways then is to<br>be overtly New Zealand in New Zealand<br>like we've now created an identity so we<br>can actually really sell ourselves and<br>get those plays as seen as somehow<br>cliched or a bit passe here these are<br>you seeing that transition and New<br>Zealand identity well sometimes it's the<br>opposite reaction so one of the<br>interesting cases for the in brief<br>fringe with that New Zealand season was<br>one of the big shows that they push was<br>the factory which was considered the<br>first Pacifica musical and so in New<br>Zealand this was this was a huge deal in<br>terms of identity and in terms of genre<br>but then when it was presented overseas<br>it didn't do very well at all because<br>even though it was presenting a new take<br>on the story there kind of saw it as<br>like an old-fashioned musical and so<br>there are still these kinds of problems<br>of translations of what we see is<br>something that's really new and exciting<br>and then it goes over and it doesn't get<br>the same sort of response thank you very<br>much James for that brilliance<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
