feet<br>are sore now to apply that metaphor to a<br>higher education context how does it<br>feel to work in an intense and<br>intellectually challenging workplace<br>with limited interaction with the<br>organization and your coworkers<br>my name is Tom a dining room<br>I'm from Faculty of Education and Social<br>Work and my resis is about part-time<br>academics academic identity half my<br>academics are increasingly becoming a<br>important part of the university<br>experience much more in some countries<br>but they are generally on the increase<br>as higher education institutions needs<br>to make up for shortfalls in government<br>funding for example just over 50% of<br>lecturers in non-profit higher education<br>institution in the u.s. are employed<br>part-time well just over 50% of academic<br>staff in Australia are employed on a<br>continuing basis the international<br>literature consistently voices concern<br>about their impact on undergraduate<br>education but it contains contradictions<br>on one hand there's a big debate whether<br>they are effective teachers and they're<br>also being<br>look up more lenient in greetings they<br>are not as qualified to be full-time<br>they don't do research so their teaching<br>is not as informed they are not<br>available to students and they don't<br>care about their institutions on the<br>other hand the recruitment of part-time<br>academics continues and they are not<br>paid extra to do extra jobs like<br>readings research or pastoral care and<br>there is a limited engagement for them<br>to into the campus life so I found this<br>ironic I am looking at the identity and<br>teaching practice of part-time academics<br>in Indonesia my country in Indonesia the<br>role of the government in institutional<br>management and employment is significant<br>for example all higher education<br>institutions have to be accredited by a<br>national accreditation body and the<br>promotion of lecturer has to be approved<br>by the government this has an impact on<br>part-time academics employment because<br>the government has set rules in place<br>about it for example in the past<br>part-time academics were allowed to have<br>formal academic positions and they were<br>counted in the staff student ratio for<br>accreditation purposes then in around<br>early 2000s they changed the rules so<br>that only those employed in the<br>university for 40 hours were allowed to<br>have academic careers from junior<br>lecturer to professors and be counted in<br>the ratio just this year the change they<br>change the rules again so that<br>institution could employ part-time<br>academics formally this latest change<br>will potentially increase the number of<br>part-time academic employment I did a<br>pilot to explore my research questions<br>what is the nature of the identity of<br>part-time academics<br>given their multiple identities and<br>roles how do they identify with their<br>role as faculty members I did<br>semi-structured interviews with four<br>Indonesian academics who are currently<br>postgraduate students in Oakland two of<br>them are part-time academics and two to<br>our full time and my temporary findings<br>show that they identify with multiple<br>roles these two groups although the<br>part-timers they identify with more<br>diverse roles but what I found really<br>interesting is that although both groups<br>were passionate about giving the best to<br>the students they don't seem to work<br>together one group will see the other as<br>like in the social identity theory it<br>can be explained as one group will see<br>the other as inferior to strengthen the<br>group identity in this study I found<br>that the two groups look at each other<br>as others and they focus on their own<br>role statements from the part-timer also<br>suggests that this is this engagement is<br>supported by the institution's perhaps<br>unintentionally so I quote it<br>they full-timers only engage me in<br>informal conversations never substantial<br>things or decision makings I rarely did<br>social interactions with other<br>colleagues in the university because<br>this institution is very transactional<br>it is not possible to interact socially<br>in that lecture room perhaps because the<br>it should be noted though although the<br>part-timers show little social<br>commitment for organizational bound they<br>indicated a strong effective commitment<br>to teaching one respondent said I will<br>keep on teaching but where I teach<br>that's another matter<br>another set if I stop teaching I will<br>lose the feeling of being a lecturer and<br>this role makes my life more colorful I<br>got my teaching satisfaction from this<br>profession I would argue that there must<br>be a more effective way to tap into the<br>richness of experience and the<br>commitment to teaching shown by the<br>part-time academics how my studies will<br>give better and more complete picture of<br>the problem and possible solution in the<br>first study I will look into the<br>identity and roles of part-time and<br>full-time academics by doing interviews<br>and teaching observations in the second<br>study I will explore similarities and<br>differences in their teaching practices<br>by conducting a survey to academics<br>survey to students combined with<br>interviews and teaching observations the<br>result of these two studies will be used<br>to propose a more effective professional<br>development opportunities for part-time<br>academics which will hopefully be able<br>to engage them more fully in their<br>teaching and in the institution because<br>we would like to see the tango continue<br>as a couple and not transforming into<br>individual tents after all it takes two<br>to tango thank you<br>thank you very much welcome questions so<br>to speak I haven't found that if this is<br>intentionally arranged thinking of how<br>so you haven't come across it you<br>haven't seen this like in the literature<br>and also like this problem is complex<br>when in one side the university would<br>like to keep the cost reduced they don't<br>want to spend more but in the other side<br>they want the experience of students to<br>be good so they want they provide basic<br>things like induction basic trainings<br>but it's not pushed enough so there is a<br>contradiction if you say that this is<br>intentionally arranged I think it is not<br>intentionally but they have in the back<br>of their mind how to keep the cost or<br>juste very politic answer and I will<br>full disclosure I have been a part-time<br>academic both here at the University of<br>Auckland and in North America so I have<br>lots of opinions about this you<br>mentioned research in this idea of<br>people working together most part-time<br>academics are doing research but without<br>research credits and without being paid<br>for that research so it does directly<br>affect the teaching so how do you think<br>the unit do you think universities are<br>being<br>13 from research active staff members<br>who they don't actually have to<br>acknowledge as research active as it's a<br>really hard question of how do how do we<br>students are benefiting from it and the<br>universities are benefiting from it but<br>the part-time staff themselves are not<br>because their research is not<br>acknowledged and how does your research<br>deal with that thorny issue social I<br>think that this very contextual like in<br>North America and perhaps in New Zealand<br>as well I know the literature said that<br>they are s qualified now they have PhD<br>and stuff that is not the case in our<br>country in in in our country if you want<br>to be to be to benefit from your<br>research you have to be in decide the<br>system which is only design for<br>full-time faculty that you have to<br>fulfill a number of credits for four<br>areas so for teaching research<br>communities work and other like serving<br>in communities and stuff well in our<br>country part-time faculty is being used<br>mainly for their experience because of<br>their experience in practical world and<br>not so much for the research but it is<br>contradictive because now the university<br>is changing not only that the university<br>wants to prepare someone to be academics<br>but it's just changed into an<br>institution that prepare for workforce<br>so if your questions is about is the<br>university benefiting from research<br>inform teaching we need to look at that<br>case again in this more in more recent<br>thank you very much tattoo</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
