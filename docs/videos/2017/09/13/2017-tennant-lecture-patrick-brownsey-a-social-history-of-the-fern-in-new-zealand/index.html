Morrison's who give<br>botany and zoology lectures here so he<br>has a good connection with what we do<br>here now<br>then he went on to become headmaster at<br>asperton high school 1905 now he did<br>meet a lot of prominent botanist while<br>he was here in Dunedin and he's<br>interested in expertise in botany led to<br>his inclusion on this trip here to the<br>sub-antarctic Islands and in 1907 and<br>basically there's a boat called Athena<br>mower that drove they've sailed around<br>all the habían tactic island speaking up<br>castaways believe it or not and they<br>found some when they dropped this this<br>bunch off to do their research they were<br>castaways they're waiting for them who<br>had rowed in a homemade boat eight<br>kilometres from disappointment Island<br>amazing story anyway the boat dropped a<br>group off its Auckland islands and a<br>group at the Campbell Island and they<br>did their boss and izing and other<br>things so as that people there to look<br>at geology archaeology what we saw ology<br>and Tenant was in the group that went to<br>the Auckland Islands and that's Tennant<br>just there okay and he's standing next<br>to Bernard<br>Eston here's another one of the botany<br>team and this is captain Dorian Smith<br>who is also an avid plant collector he<br>collected thousands of plants in New<br>Zealand and a stray<br>and they were the fourth person on their<br>team was Lenin cocaine who has been<br>described as a father of modern science<br>in New Zealand in a prominent botanist<br>and cocaine sitting in between the<br>curator of the museum of a cannery and a<br>create curator of the it's hyegyo Museum<br>and professor of botany Benin Benham so<br>you know there's because I'm Lisa beam<br>guys yeah now they the our speaker today<br>tells me that the collections they made<br>very little pop up in Wellington<br>certainement went on to become a school<br>inspector and the only 19:23 was made<br>Victoria University's first professor of<br>education so and he did that while he is<br>also at the same time head of the<br>teachers Trading College up there as<br>well and he retired in 1926 so it looks<br>like he moved to Nelson because in 1955<br>he sent a letter to the university<br>saying in return for all that Otago<br>University has done for for me he wants<br>to give it a small donation it was a<br>thousand pounds and it was to be given<br>to the university upon the death of his<br>wife which was the second wife Winifred<br>when she died in 1908 at the bottom of<br>the ladder there is for research into<br>the native flora of New Zealand so his<br>wife we knew Fred died in 1974 and she<br>ended up giving over half her estate so<br>the Department of botany and the<br>Department initiated the john smilee<br>lecture so this year's tenant lecturer<br>is dr. Patrick Ramsey from - Papa<br>Tongarewa the Museum of New Zealand<br>Patti DS PhD on ferns at the University<br>of Leeds and I understand he's one of<br>the people in the department also<br>studying was the Zealand's bryophyte<br>expert dick Jessica beaver and in fact<br>my PhD supervisor in Ashford as well I<br>strange coincidence<br>Peck came to New Zealand in 1973 worked<br>at Victoria University and the<br>University of Auckland<br>then got the job at soap opera as the or<br>at the Museum of New Zealand<br>as a curator of botany and then yeah<br>that's what he'd say he is a fern<br>specialist and you might know his book<br>about ferns and allied plants of New<br>Zealand and he has probably excuse me<br>widely in on not just on ferns but also<br>many other things many flowering plants<br>you might not know that he founded and<br>oversaw the project that resulted in the<br>illustrated guide to New Zealand he bees<br>which is a beautiful big book that was<br>authored by Mike Bailey of Allison<br>Killough so as well as that pet is a<br>curator of steps met to Papa<br>so I think that's a real bonus because<br>it'll add to what a fascinating talk<br>this is going to be and he's made a<br>scuse me and he's currently working as a<br>research associate on a flora of New<br>Zealand which is funded by Wayne care<br>research so pets made a really<br>significant and lasting contributions to<br>botany in New Zealand<br>and so it's very appropriate and we've<br>quite pleasure that I invite pet Browns<br>Patrick Drowsy to present their 2017<br>john smilee tenant lecture<br>well good evening everybody and thank<br>you first of all for inviting me to come<br>and give this lecture it's a great honor<br>and I really is appreciated thank you<br>very much David I can't claim to have<br>any personal association with john<br>smilee tenant but i can tell you that<br>some of his plant collections are in the<br>herbarium at - papa<br>he gave flowering plants to Donald<br>Petrie and he sent bryophytes to<br>Sainsbury so his collections are being<br>looked after along with a lot of other<br>well known botanical collectors in New<br>Zealand now this evenings talk is<br>probably going to be very different to<br>previous tenant lectures as you can see<br>I've titled it a social history of the<br>field in New Zealand and so it is very<br>much about social history rather than<br>hard botanical science but we have<br>recently had a flag debate in New<br>Zealand and I was impressed if that's<br>the right word with a lot of the<br>misinformation that was put around at<br>the time and I guess that goes with<br>every discussion and debate that we have<br>about various things but this seemed<br>like a good opportunity to not<br>specifically address the flag debate but<br>to look at the history of the fern in<br>New Zealand and how its progressed from<br>just a native plant through to it now an<br>icon of New Zealand and a symbol of<br>national identity as David has said I'm<br>not only have been the curator of botany<br>but I am also a curator of the stamp<br>collection and it's actually a very big<br>collection because it's the archive of<br>the old New Zealand post office so it's<br>it's a very substantial collection and I<br>thought that this was an opportunity to<br>bring the two things together it's also<br>an opportunity to look at how<br>scientists and artists and craftsmen in<br>the 19th century intersected much more<br>than we probably do today so that's what<br>this evenings talk is all about so my<br>story starts in Christchurch with the<br>New Zealand International Exhibition<br>that was held there from November 1906<br>to April 1907<br>this was very much the brainchild of the<br>then Prime Minister dick seden he was<br>trying to raise the status of New<br>Zealand from a colony up to being a<br>Dominion within the British Empire and<br>he thought an international exhibition<br>of this sort would showcase New Zealand<br>and show that it was worthy of Dominion<br>status and indeed he was successful<br>because in September 1907 New Zealand<br>became a Dominion now this is the the<br>proclamation for the exhibition and this<br>is an artefact held at tip upper and you<br>can see there are the iconography<br>includes ferns but it was a hugely<br>successful exhibition nearly two million<br>visits were made and this was a time<br>when New Zealand had less than a million<br>people we think we're doing well it's a<br>puffer these days to put through 1.8<br>million people when we have a population<br>of 5 million and cruise ships coming to<br>the harbour every week in the season<br>this is the the site of the exhibition<br>in Hagley Park Lee you can see it was a<br>pretty extensive exhibition a lot of<br>and this is a promotional letter card of<br>the time and as well as the the worthies<br>here you see that the tree fern already<br>is starting to feature on the<br>iconography and when you got inside this<br>is the the North Canterbury Court you<br>would expect to see a whole lot of<br>agricultural produce from that part of<br>New Zealand but you can see that the<br>entranceway here is lined with ferns<br>they are the thing that are attracting<br>people's attention and it's only right<br>at the<br>but that you start to see the the<br>agricultural produce and there was a<br>fernery at this exhibition and it was a<br>star attraction for the exhibition there<br>were 80 different species on display<br>under the care of JB Armstrong and this<br>at a time when the were a hundred and<br>sixty species recognized in the flora so<br>it was a remarkable job to get half the<br>flora there in cultivation but people<br>were entranced with the fernery there's<br>no question about that<br>now 1906 was also the year in which<br>Thomas Cheeseman published his manual of<br>the New Zealand flora and this was<br>important because it was the first<br>comprehensive fluorescence Hookers<br>handbook of 1867 and perhaps more<br>importantly it was the first that had<br>been produced entirely in New Zealand by<br>a resident botanist now of course it<br>built on the work that had gone before<br>and there's a lot of famous names there<br>and I'm just going to look very briefly<br>at some of those people but in<br>Cheeseman's flora he recognized 156<br>species today as you can see or at least<br>in 2012 we recognized a hundred and<br>ninety-six species so the numbers are<br>still increasing and actually Landcare<br>have just put out a new checklist and<br>the fern flora lists exactly 200 native<br>species so I don't want to move from 200<br>you know it's a nice round number so if<br>we describe more some others have got a<br>drop-off somewhere else<br>okay bags and cylinder cooks first<br>voyage now this is when European botany<br>in New Zealand start now there are no<br>contemporary images on that are really<br>relevant of banks and Solander<br>collecting in New Zealand<br>these are caricatures published after<br>the voyage in 1772 here's the rather<br>solid cylinder and the more mercurial<br>banks here this is probably a better<br>representation of what they look like<br>collecting in Australia and here is the<br>the brilliant young artist Sidney<br>Parkinson who tragically died on the<br>return voyage in Batavia and who<br>sketched all the plants that banks and<br>Solander were collecting now when all<br>the material of course went back to<br>london inter-bank his own private<br>collection and then later into the<br>Natural History Museum and he decided he<br>was going to write a flora of New<br>Zealand and it was going to be called<br>parameter I floor I know visa LAN di and<br>so London wrote fulsome descriptions of<br>over 340 native species including 57<br>ferns and banks had his artists working<br>up the sketches as have been made on the<br>voyage and getting them engraved onto<br>copper plates to illustrate the book but<br>sadly it never happened for a whole<br>variety and reasons which I don't have<br>time to go into that book never happened<br>and that was a tragedy really but the<br>specimens live on and the the main<br>collection of course is in London at the<br>Natural History Museum but in the 1890s<br>a duplicate set was sent out in New<br>Zealand for Thomas Kirk who was writing<br>the students flora of New Zealand and we<br>have a large collection at tip upper the<br>auckland museum has some and the and<br>lankier have them too but this is the<br>first specimen of New Zealand silver<br>fern that was collected by European<br>botanists and down here which you can<br>see in the red writing that's so lenders<br>handwriting so those are the original<br>labels written by daniel cylinder now<br>the plates themselves that banks had<br>prepared set in abeyance in their in a<br>storeroom in the basement of the museum<br>until the 1980s and then a private firm<br>in conjunction with the Natural History<br>Museum decided to print from those<br>plates and they were pulled out cleaned<br>up and the technique that they used was<br>a technique called a la poopit<br>so that was basically getting a cotton<br>bud and putting their colors into the<br>plate and it was quite a laborious<br>process as you can imagine but what it<br>meant was that you could put more than<br>one color onto the plate at the same<br>time and then you'd print it and get<br>these beautiful pulled and then the<br>plate had to be cleaned and the whole<br>process done all over again<br>and needless to say it was a limited<br>edition that they produced now cooks<br>second voyage the botanists on this<br>voyage were Johanna and George Foster<br>two German botanists and this of course<br>was the probably the most successful of<br>Cook's voyages when all around the<br>Pacific and they collected from all the<br>different island groups and when they<br>got back to England or back to Europe I<br>should say George Foster wrote a little<br>book a little thin book with<br>descriptions of New Zealand plants and<br>these were the first published<br>descriptions of New Zealand plants<br>unfortunately there are only two lines<br>long so they're not very adequate<br>descriptions but nevertheless these are<br>the first published descriptions and<br>there are 20 fern species that are<br>attributed to New Zealand<br>but foresters collections are now widely<br>dispersed all around Europe and it's<br>actually quite hard to track them all<br>down but these are two of the foods that<br>they described the the mama coup on the<br>left and the hounds tongue firm on the<br>right and this is a plant zip tres ten<br>Ensis that they also described and as<br>its name suggests they thought it came<br>from Tanna Island in Vanuatu but we now<br>know that this plant is actually a New<br>Zealand endemic and they muddled up the<br>localities but this here is the first<br>published illustration of a New Zealand<br>firm published in 1830 forages had nose<br>sniffing botany associated with it and<br>we had to wait for George Vancouver's<br>voyage of 1791 now he was sent out to<br>explore the northwest coast of America<br>but he stopped off in Western Australia<br>and then came across to New Zealand and<br>went into dusky sound and his botanist<br>was Archibald Menzies or probably minis<br>as he would have been pronounced in<br>those days and he was particularly<br>interested in bryophytes and ferns and<br>so he made extensive collections when<br>they went back they got worked up as<br>these beautiful illustrations in a book<br>called<br>I Tony's phyla come by W J hooker and<br>Greville soda like he near Alpina here<br>and what should we call this Huppert sea<br>of area it's probably going to change<br>its name but that's will do for the<br>moment then they came a whole series of<br>French expeditions of course led by La<br>Perouse his voyage founded they were<br>shipwrecked in Vanuatu and then there<br>were a series of other expeditions that<br>were sent out in search of him most<br>notable was the Don Turkish toe voyage<br>who had with him jean-jacques LaBelle<br>Audi air and he collected extensively in<br>Australia and many of the plants that he<br>collected there of the same as the ones<br>in in New Zealand dooper II he had pls<br>along with him and the algal genus<br>lawsonia is named after him and Dumont<br>d'Urville and Devillier is named after<br>him<br>as well as French Pass which he more or<br>less successfully negotiated and divil<br>Island of course which is named after<br>him and then all of that material went<br>back to Paris and it was worked up by a<br>man called a keel Richard and he<br>published an essay on this with some 57<br>species of ferns of which this is a<br>beautiful illustration of our silver<br>fern then came Alain Cunningham he was a<br>collector for Kew Gardens<br>he was based in Australia but he visited<br>New Zealand and Norfolk Island and and<br>then wrote up a precursor of the New<br>Zealand flora that was published in lots<br>of different parts in different journals<br>so it's a bit messy but it does contain<br>descriptions of 80 odd New Zealand<br>species so the numbers were increasing<br>all the time and look soma cunningham ii<br>i is named after alan cunningham now<br>this will probably prove to be our only<br>endemic fern genus it's nearest relative<br>is in us in South America Locke synopsis<br>we used to have a couple of other<br>endemic general the kidney fern and<br>little EPA but both of those molecular<br>work has shown that they actually sit<br>firmly within other genera so this will<br>be the only endemic genus now in 1839<br>James Clark Ross came out on his big<br>Antarctic voyage and he went further<br>south into the Antarctic than anyone had<br>been before and in fact as far as it was<br>possible to go with sailing ships his<br>two boats were the Erebus and the terror<br>and of course his name is commemorated<br>in Ross dependency and Erebus and the<br>terror<br>names are used in many different places<br>but the most important thing from a<br>botanical point of view was that on<br>board was a young Joseph Hooker later<br>the director of Kew Gardens and he<br>collected assiduously wherever this<br>expedition went and subsequently wrote<br>up six magnificent volumes flora<br>Antarctica flora no visa LAN di and<br>floor it has many I am writing a flora<br>of those three areas you would think<br>would be enough for one person's<br>lifetime but he went on to describe<br>plants from Great Britain and the whole<br>of British India which in those days<br>extended from what we now call<br>Bangladesh will write the way down to<br>Sri Lanka through boomer and the Malay<br>Peninsula and that certainly was a job<br>in a half these are illustrations from<br>flora and tat<br>this is status cunningham eiv umbrella<br>phone this of course it's not a fin but<br>it is in my view one of the most<br>attractive illustrations of a new<br>zealand plant published anywhere a<br>pleura filum species so i couldn't<br>resist putting it in no roses voyage<br>refitted at the bay of islands in 1841<br>and the hooker met William Collins oh<br>now William Collins Oh was the first<br>resident botanist in New Zealand he had<br>been brought out by the Church<br>Missionary Society as a printer and he<br>set up the first printing press in New<br>Zealand he printed the first Maori Bible<br>the first Maori prayer book and a whole<br>lot of other things as well but in his<br>spare time he was a botanist and he<br>collected a lot of plants and over his<br>lifetime he sent a huge amounts of<br>material to the hookers at Kew he formed<br>a lifelong friendship with with hooker<br>they never met again after the<br>expedition left but they correspond it<br>and there is an enormous correspondence<br>now in 1841 kill Enzo got leave and his<br>idea of a holiday was to stir on the<br>east coast of the North Island walk into<br>the era where he was the first European<br>to see lake waikaremoana he walked there<br>out to Rotorua from Rotorua Auckland and<br>from Auckland back to the bay of islands<br>and he collected plants all the way<br>along the line and in particular he<br>collected some twenty-seven new species<br>of ferns from in within Aware district<br>and these extraordinarily were published<br>in a short-lived journal called the<br>tasmanian journal of natural science now<br>in 1840 Tasmania was no more than a<br>penal colony and it was only because of<br>the governor John Franklin that who was<br>interested in science that they had a<br>jail at all<br>these specimens are now at tu papa and<br>that's in our herbarium and this is<br>cleansers<br>driving here but of the other specimens<br>that he sent back to queue these many of<br>these got written up by the hookers and<br>were illustrated by them and these are<br>two illustrations from hookers century<br>of foods beautiful illustrations of<br>troika Marnie's kill Enzo I here in<br>Blenheim here then in 1867 came<br>Joseph hookers handbook of the New<br>Zealand flora<br>now this was an extraordinary volume it<br>described in the one volume every native<br>plant then known from New Zealand some<br>900 C plants 135 ferns 800 bryophytes<br>lichens and fungi and no comparable<br>catalog of the entire flora has ever<br>been attempted since and never will be<br>we do things separately now you did see<br>plants the ferns and so on there were no<br>illustrations in this book and so it was<br>a very cheap volume and it made it<br>accessible to the whole population that<br>wanted to know about New Zealand plants<br>and it had been commissioned by the New<br>Zealand government and they were so<br>pleased with the results that they<br>commissioned this beautiful writing desk<br>as a present to hooker for this piece of<br>work now this was commissioned from a<br>man called Anton SOI furred who was a<br>cabinet maker and came to Auckland in<br>the 1860s how he made a living in the<br>Auckland of the 1860s producing this<br>sort of furniture is hard to understand<br>but he did and as I say this one was<br>commissioned by the New Zealand<br>government sent to hooker at Kew and<br>subsequently in the 1990s it came up for<br>auction in London and a very obscure<br>auction it was in the rather<br>disreputable state but our historians at<br>tip upper recognized it for what it was<br>bid on it and were successful it was<br>repatriated in New Zealand and lovingly<br>restored and<br>Dawn's the displays from time to time<br>but it's engrave for this little plaque<br>that says from grateful colonists in New<br>Zealand to the eminent botanist the<br>discoverer of their flora at Joseph<br>Dalton okay so it was a remarkable<br>present I don't expect to get a cabinet<br>from the New Zealand government when I<br>complete the ear flora that soy furred<br>produced a lot of really fine furniture<br>and this is a table that he produced for<br>Falk and like worthy it's now @q<br>unfortunately it's not in the best<br>possible condition I have seen it it's<br>got a big split across it and it's faded<br>at each end and I think it's got worse<br>and recent years but the remarkable<br>thing about this table is it's got<br>inlaid fern inlaid marquetry firm<br>designs and you can identify 29<br>different species of New Zealand fern in<br>that one table but papers have been<br>written about this this table but it<br>shows the importance of the fern in New<br>Zealand at this time that he thought it<br>was important to put them into a table<br>he produced more of these sorts of<br>writing desks this was made for a man<br>called Archibald watt of Hawke's Bay in<br>1875 but here more intricate inlaid<br>marquetry designs of ferns on all of<br>these main panels and there is fern work<br>up here as well now this is the work of<br>Anton's son William and this was<br>presented to major-general baden-powell<br>at the time when the siege of Mafeking<br>had been raised and there was such a<br>patriotic fervor throughout the whole<br>British Empire at this event that the<br>citizens of Auckland thought it was<br>appropriate to raise enough money to<br>commissioned this work from Anton's son<br>and it - is it inscribed by admirers in<br>the province of Auckland New Zealand in<br>recognition of distinguished services<br>rendered to the Empire during the siege<br>of mare thinking well this piece of<br>came on the market a few years ago from<br>the family to Papa tried to get it<br>unfortunately the price was too high and<br>we withdrew but a few years later the<br>Auckland museum got in on the act and<br>they bought it I think they negotiated a<br>much better price and it now resides in<br>the Auckland Museum and is on display or<br>was the last time I went there but once<br>again you can see the same sort of<br>inlaid fern designs that fit in late<br>market redesigns now at this time in<br>Victorian England there was indices in<br>the 1880s there was what can only be<br>described as a fern craze and this<br>little book here describes it as a<br>history of Tara dough mania the<br>Victorians were groove ferns in their<br>garden in their parlors in these ornate<br>Wardian cases they had burns on their<br>wallpaper on their curtains even on<br>their chamber pots but despite that some<br>good things came out of this and one of<br>them was an expansion of the literature<br>and one of the techniques in vogue then<br>for illustrating ferns was nature<br>printing and this is one of the best<br>examples Thomas More's and nature<br>printed British fears so you'd dry a<br>fern and use it to create an impression<br>on a lithographic stone and then print<br>the impression in one color and then the<br>secondary colors would be colored in by<br>hand usually by female very poorly paid<br>female workers working at night but<br>there were also horticultural books that<br>started at this time this is one by<br>georges schneider the book of choice<br>ferns which has got rather a modern ring<br>to it but it illustrates and described<br>ferns from all over the world including<br>from New Zealand this is the mamako here<br>so it was bringing these ferns<br>the attention of the world and how to<br>grow them but all this interest of the<br>Victorians in their firms in England<br>actually had rather devastating<br>consequences because a lot of species<br>became quite rare they were just ripped<br>out of their countryside and became very<br>rare so after a while they started to<br>look further afield and New Zealand was<br>one of the obvious places to come to<br>because we are at the country of fins so<br>a number of things were exported to<br>England but also a number of people<br>around the country set up sort of<br>cottage industry of producing fern<br>albums pressed firms in albums and one<br>of the best-known of these people was<br>Eric Craig who operated from a shop in<br>Auckland and he supplied these films for<br>people bought them to send back to their<br>family overseas this is the shop that he<br>operated from he called it a museum but<br>it's really just a curiosity shop in<br>process tree and here's an advertisement<br>of the from the time Craig's Curiosity<br>Shop New Zealand ferns model carry<br>covers speciality curios from the<br>Pacific Islands you you get the drift of<br>the sort of thing that he was selling<br>but they were very beautiful pieces of<br>work this is one of the fern albums with<br>a carved carry cover to it and there<br>were others there was George Burton in<br>Nelson and Thomas Cromwell in Auckland<br>and mrs. Armstrong down here in Dunedin<br>and all of these albums had their own<br>distinctive style and a lot of those are<br>coming onto the market now if you look<br>in second ground auctions they are<br>available but you could also buy these<br>little boxes<br>here's Craig's advertisement little<br>boxes with small herbarium sheets and<br>sputter work designs on the covers of<br>books was very popular at this time too<br>but you could go to these shops and if<br>you wanted you could make up your own<br>album you could buy the pages you could<br>buy the ferns you<br>by the mosses at the bottom to adorn the<br>page you could buy their labels<br>you could buy everything and you could<br>put it all together into your own<br>homemade album and send it off to your<br>family overseas at the other end of a<br>spectrum with these beautiful deluxe<br>albums and this of course is the work of<br>Anton SOI effort though we've seen<br>already here are inlaid marquetry<br>designs and they are so good that you<br>can identify this as Homer Laughlin<br>toilet item and this one has a D Antony<br>theorem and insight you get these<br>beautifully laid out fins and little<br>mosses at the bottom it's it's a<br>staggering piece of work visit I enjoy<br>showing it to people every time we have<br>visitors but it wasn't just food albums<br>excuse me<br>silverware was the worst silverware<br>silversmiths I'm sorry making these sort<br>of table centerpieces of tree ferns now<br>this is the work of Charles Jeff's he<br>made a speciality of pressing dried<br>firms and he exhibited them at the<br>international exhibitions in Sydney and<br>Melbourne in 1879 and 1881 honey<br>actually won prizes for these press<br>specimens they are quite attractive and<br>these two are in the collection at to<br>Papa but what's much more interesting is<br>that he came to the attention of King<br>toffee Oh in the Waikato notif you had<br>working for him a Canadian doctor and<br>when the doctor account went back to<br>Canada TAFIa wanted to give him a<br>present<br>so he commissioned Jeff's to produce<br>these preferred specimens exactly as it<br>done for the International Exhibition<br>and to give them the name but also wrote<br>on there what the Maori had used these<br>films for so this is guy keenya<br>Cunningham the eye and the sir is a<br>powerful narcotic apparently<br>I never knew and a spleen iam favela<br>folium applied to scolds and burns as a<br>poultice so there is information in here<br>which is not available in a lot of the<br>early literature about Maori medicine<br>and these pressed phones which are at<br>tip up are now regarded as a target by<br>the Waikato tribes now with all this<br>interest in ferns there was a need for<br>identification guides that were cheap<br>and accessible to the general population<br>and Herbert dubby decided that a good<br>way to do this was to use the cyanotype<br>process and this is basically the<br>architects blueprint so you get sheets<br>of paper impregnate them with a variety<br>of chemicals mostly including iron<br>compounds put the sheet of paper in the<br>Sun put a pressed fern on top of it and<br>a sheet of glass to hold it all down<br>expose it to the sunlight for a certain<br>length of time wash it in water and the<br>exposed parts went this exquisite deep<br>Russian blue color and you get a<br>wonderful white on blue image and those<br>silhouettes are perfectly adequate for<br>identifying most of New Zealand's ferns<br>now as you can see the books were put<br>together rather crudely just rather<br>rough cardboard I don't know how many<br>were produced but I know now that those<br>may be a handful of examples still known<br>mostly in institutions now he later sold<br>his plates to Erik Craig who we've<br>already seen and Craig produced two more<br>versions of the book with increasing<br>numbers of varieties but all of these<br>so-called blue books are now extremely<br>rare now in 1921 Dobby produced a much<br>more traditional book New Zealand ferns<br>that ran for six editions four through<br>six editions it was the the Bible on New<br>Zealand<br>for many years interestingly on the<br>title page it says second edition<br>revised and greatly enlarged and when I<br>first came to New Zealand in 1973 nobody<br>knew what the first edition of this book<br>was but of course it was the Blue Book<br>that we've just looked at and it was so<br>different from this that nobody put the<br>two together this is my favorite<br>photograph of a New Zealand botanist<br>according to his biographer Dobby<br>traveled 24,000 miles on that bicycle I<br>find that hard to believe that that's<br>why he tells us and the bicycle fell<br>apart eventually in Africa and he had to<br>buy a new machine but he was a man of<br>many parts he actually worked for the<br>government railways<br>he was district manager of the Northland<br>railway for 16 years or so now that's a<br>grandiose title but the Northland<br>railway in those days ran from Whangarei<br>to keio about 20 kilometres and there<br>were three trains a week so he wasn't<br>overworked he had plenty of time to<br>write his phone book and he also but he<br>also did do something in the of interest<br>to philatelists and that he organised<br>prepayment of parcels on the the<br>Northland line and these were based on<br>an earlier newspaper stamp these<br>squiggles he had mean very little but<br>when you turn the stamps upside down you<br>see his initials are there HB d Herbert<br>badger Dobby and that's how he cancelled<br>now another interesting gentleman is<br>William Bach who came to New Zealand<br>from Tasmania and he was an engraver<br>a stamp designer and a printer again a<br>man of many parts he printed this book<br>the art album of New Zealand flora which<br>I'm sure you are<br>so in company with alfred cousins he<br>produced this book and it was the first<br>New Zealand book printed in full-color<br>by chromolithography in their criminal<br>orthography was an exacting task you had<br>to put the plate through the printing<br>press as many times as you had different<br>colors and you had to get an exact match<br>and this were more or less sent the film<br>brick but they did publish the book that<br>were intended to be three volumes but<br>only one was ever published the book<br>went on to design stamps now the early<br>New Zealand stamps these designs here<br>featured nothing but the Queen's Head on<br>them no other identifiable thing but in<br>seventeen 1878 this stamp was issued<br>it's important for two reasons firstly<br>bach was the designer being graver and<br>ultimately the printer and this is the<br>first New Zealand stamp that was<br>completely produced in New Zealand and<br>the quality of the work was super the<br>second important thing is that down in<br>the bottom corner we have a fern design<br>the first object that is identifiable<br>other than the Monarchs head and I think<br>it's actually quite significant that<br>it's a fern it's showing the importance<br>of the food in New Zealand society at<br>the time but it just incidentally the<br>quality of this work these way ahead of<br>anything that was being produced in<br>Australia at the time here are some of<br>box designs for the 1898 pictorial<br>stamps here are his designs and here of<br>the issued stamps and you can see their<br>works of quality he also engraved Bank<br>checks believe it or not in those days<br>Bank checks were engraved you have these<br>beautiful pictures showing fern designs<br>tree ferns rather unhappy looking Kiwi<br>he designed these stamps for the<br>Christchurch exhibition which is where<br>we started this talk<br>he he designed and engraved these stamps<br>and you can tell the quality of his work<br>from this design which was also<br>submitted for the 1898 pictorial issue<br>it simply doesn't compare but it does<br>have a tree fern and a lot of these<br>designs that were never accepted<br>incorporate tree ferns these are even<br>worse a very unamused Queen Victoria but<br>but note the number that they've all got<br>tree ferns associated with them all<br>field so the fern is really starting to<br>become important in New Zealand society<br>at this time and from that time on ferns<br>became a feature of many stamps so these<br>are the 1898 pictorial stamps you can<br>see tree ferns down the side here and<br>down here but later they're on the<br>victory stamps of 1920 the Centennial<br>stamps of 1940 with a very stylized tree<br>fern they're on the early airmail stamps<br>and early health steps not only on<br>stamps but also on stickers that<br>promoted commercial products or War<br>veterans welfare or all sorts of things<br>so here's a war veterans welfare league<br>from Gallipoli the centennial games of<br>1940 that never happened because of the<br>war kayakoy woollen goods and so on<br>they're all incorporating the firm<br>design and place names to started to<br>come into vogue so fern flat firm side<br>Fern Hill mamak ooh why mama COO and<br>there are lots more and then in 1901<br>Universal penny postage was introduced<br>and postage was reduced from tuppence to<br>a penny for letters and lated from down<br>to a hate me for postcards and thirteen<br>million more items were posted in 1901<br>than in 1900 there's a lesson there for<br>New Zealand Post<br>but the era of the postcard had begun<br>and that decade between 1900 and the<br>start of the First World War<br>millions of postcards were produced and<br>sent and indeed the postcard and later<br>the advertising mm provided a medium for<br>the four main drivers of the firm's<br>popularity in New Zealand and these are<br>tourism warfare health and sport and<br>I'll just look at each of those in turn<br>so in the Edwardian era tourism was<br>starting to take off and the post office<br>and the government tourist board produce<br>cards at that time with beautiful views<br>of the main tourist spots and on the<br>address side you get these beautifully<br>engraved Triffids<br>by William buck but commercial postcards<br>appear at this time too so you'd get the<br>views from your local area and then<br>you'd superimpose on that ferns in the<br>background and every little town in New<br>Zealand would produce postcards looking<br>very like this this is from handler but<br>they almost every turn you can find them<br>and then there were colored postcards<br>that went overseas again with ferns and<br>often with Maori iconography and this is<br>an interesting card because this is a<br>Maori New Year card inscribed entirely<br>in Maori so it's got a drawing of a tree<br>fern and then a photograph of one on the<br>centre superimposed and then on through<br>the 20s and 30s you get these stickers<br>showing views of New Zealand often with<br>tree ferns featured and these are<br>advertising envelopes from Toyota ha and<br>Maine tag mountain and other tourist<br>destinations again frequently featuring<br>the fin and this is extended right<br>through to the modern day so this is a<br>cover from the 1960s from the Kapiti<br>Coast from Rotorua and this is a cover<br>for the<br>snowpark stamps of the 1970s beautiful<br>tree fern here and a rather unlikely<br>looking white heron standing underneath<br>it in the 40s and 50s people hand<br>colored their cards and covers so again<br>you get beautiful fern designs and in<br>this case the turkey hey for an issue<br>for the Southland centennial but this I<br>think is one of the most important cats<br>it was a postcard to commemorate the<br>visit of the American Great White Fleet<br>to Auckland in 1908 the Americans were<br>doing a show off around the Pacific they<br>visited all the islands and Australia<br>New Zealand and other places and this<br>was a set of six postcards produced for<br>when they came to Auckland on one side<br>we've got the American flag and where we<br>ought to have the New Zealand flag we've<br>got a fern<br>so the fern is becoming a symbol of New<br>then we come to warfare and these cards<br>produce for the Boer War and for the<br>First World War the regiment's would<br>produce these for their servicemen to<br>send them back home and they had of<br>course all the insignia and the flags<br>but all often all also burns on them and<br>cards were produced for families to send<br>to their husbands sons whatever serving<br>overseas and again you frequently find<br>tree ferns or ferns or birds with the<br>flag but there's a bulldog here just to<br>remind us that we're in the British<br>Empire<br>silk postcards were produced in great<br>quantities by French peasant women and<br>soul to New Zealand servicemen in the<br>First World War and again these feature<br>ferns to a large degree and even in the<br>Second World War when air drafts were<br>produced so there was huge volumes of<br>mail going overseas at Christmastime and<br>it wasn't possible to shift the mail so<br>you had to go to the post office right<br>what was rather like a telegram form it<br>would get photographed and the negative<br>would be sent overseas and then the<br>messages would be printed out and<br>delivered to the servicemen but these<br>you see here's clematis and and here's a<br>tree fern botanical iconography is very<br>important and patriotic covers before<br>the war and after the war again<br>frequently feature the fern health<br>covers these were produced in huge<br>numbers through the 30s 40s 50s and 60s<br>and lots of them were produced the sale<br>of these health stamps supported the<br>health camps for 60 children and they<br>were very popular eagerly awaited and<br>bought in huge numbers and they very<br>often featured ferns sport of course all<br>of our teams have worn the silver fern<br>virtually every sport in fact either has<br>it on the sporting apparel or or in the<br>case of yachties on the boat itself but<br>the single biggest factor promoting the<br>fern as an icon in New Zealand has<br>undoubtedly been on rugby clothing since<br>that famous tour of 1888 and the turret<br>of Britain by the New Zealand natives<br>team there is a cap from that time with<br>a silver fern on it and here's a modern<br>All Blacks Jersey with the silver fern<br>on if you need reminding but the phone<br>has become a powerful symbol of New<br>Zealand identity it's on our coinage<br>it's in our coat of arms it was put into<br>the coat of arms in 1956 when the coat<br>of arms was modified it's a cultural<br>icon of course<br>I haven't talked at all about Maori<br>designs because I'm no sort of an expert<br>on that but of course the karo and<br>everything the design is is all through<br>Maori culture<br>but news air new zealand pinched it and<br>their core is of there aeroplanes the<br>Kiwi and the fern together are<br>especially evocative so you get lots of<br>pieces of ephemera of this sort services<br>than using an Conservation Club this is<br>an era Graham this is the famous round<br>stamp with a kiwi and a fern on it and<br>then it became a commercial branding<br>device and this is one of the earliest<br>this is for the fern leaf butter this is<br>a karakia shook as you I'm sure know<br>vast amounts of kakatiya was sent out of<br>New Zealand in the form of butter boxes<br>to Europe on a one-way trip but the fern<br>has been adopted by lots of different<br>commercial organisations since then lamb<br>so the wool mark the silver fern railcar<br>golden fern tobacco it goes on and on<br>but it's often used also as a symbol of<br>reassurance and security and inspiration<br>so you see the fern on the logo of the<br>Medical Council of the New Zealand<br>Police on the Institute of horticulture<br>New Zealand finance New Zealand<br>Insurance talks about peace of mind over<br>a silver fern and perhaps it's best<br>exemplified by our bank notes not only<br>is there a design that incorporates the<br>the fern but there's a symbolic fern<br>that's in the main security device here<br>and really all prestigious events seem<br>to demand the use of the food so when we<br>changed a decimal currency the dollar<br>sat over a<br>the China New Zealand Expo you get this<br>beautiful dragon and fern juxtaposition<br>and even when we open so puffer there<br>was a film there but sometimes it's<br>quite subtle so this is a promotional<br>card for the New Zealand black fins<br>rugby team here are the women and their<br>shadows forming a fern design and this<br>is for the New Zealand Symphony<br>Orchestra I think that's very clever I<br>love that person but you find that the<br>phone is actually starting to replace<br>internationally recognized symbols so<br>what's going on here is this a dove it's<br>not a an olive branch she's holding it's<br>it's a fern or is this actually a rather<br>badly drawn - II I don't know the<br>answers of that but down here well yes<br>this is a Christmas cover we've got<br>Holly and we've got Christmas bells but<br>Ivy has disappeared being replaced by<br>ferns for some reason and what's going<br>on here Holly doesn't low grow like that<br>and this is even worse over here anyway<br>New Zealand Post has at times challenged<br>our botanical knowledge but finally in<br>2013 we got a set of stamps devoted<br>entirely to firms now I've said that<br>many New Zealand firms of her stamps<br>have had feds on them but it wasn't<br>until 2030 a fern was the main subject<br>of the step and I'm pleased to say I was<br>involved with this I suggested the idea<br>to New Zealand Post and I help the<br>designer find appropriate films and he<br>did a really good job but we had to wait<br>for a firm on the flag and in the end we<br>had an inconclusive debate I mean I have<br>to say I'm a fan of putting a silver<br>fern on the flag because I think it does<br>it is part of New Zealand's identity the<br>Canadians did a great job with their<br>Maple Leaf I think we could do the same<br>here but the problem I think we had was<br>that there was too many designs all the<br>same and there wasn't enough real choice<br>and in the end we had a choice between<br>that and that which are virtually the<br>anyway so that's really what I wanted to<br>say in conclusion my thanks to these<br>people for help with producing some of<br>these slides and also this image of a<br>car that suddenly appeared outside the<br>botany window it to Papa one lunch time<br>and I couldn't resist taking a<br>photograph of it it's yeah spray-painted<br>fern on the bodice of the car clearly<br>someone is even more enthusiastic about<br>ferns than I am to deface their their<br>car in that way so that's where I'd like<br>to leave it thank you very much for<br>listening<br>I don't wanna slow down where the answer<br>that's conjecture but I think Finn the<br>phone has always been in New Zealand as<br>I say I didn't talk about Marley at all<br>and it was really important to the Maori<br>so there's an even longer history than<br>that so I sort of feel that probably the<br>firm would have been important yeah yeah<br>but even in Australia Finn there's lots<br>of places that are named after ferns<br>there - that may have some of the same<br>feelings as we do of course yes yes yes<br>yes and oh goodness I've forgotten the<br>lady's name who did it but she worked it<br>to puppet or she didn't work it but she<br>came to to pepper quite often and we<br>actually had those panels for a long<br>time yeah no it was a wonderful design<br>at that time it was well ahead of its<br>time<br>really yeah yeah yeah yeah no that was<br>200 species native species yes well<br>that's an interesting question because<br>it's not great it's not huge what we<br>lack in numbers of species we make up<br>for in abundance so the forest layer<br>here is dominated by ferns on the forest<br>floor where is he go to Europe to<br>temperate Europe there's a lot more<br>flowering plants on the forest floor<br>than the riot is here but by the way of<br>comparison you know little islands like<br>Fiji has over 300 species New Caledonia<br>has 250 or probably more now and the<br>these are course of tropical or<br>subtropical islands and there you do get<br>much greater diversity than you do in<br>New Zealand we have probably more fern<br>species than Southeast Australia but<br>once you get up into North Queensland<br>the numbers go up dramatically so but on<br>the other hand we've got certainly more<br>species than Britain which is a very<br>comparable country in terms of latitude<br>and size and so on so yeah but it's just<br>that the foods are such an important<br>component of the vegetation here if you<br>go to a tropical country you often are<br>struggling to find the you've got to<br>look hard for foods and whereas here<br>oh yeah well the phones got lots going<br>for it and it's it's design it's also<br>from a botanical point of view that it's<br>a small enough group for beginners who<br>are getting interested in botany toe to<br>concentrate on 200 species is not an<br>overwhelming number whereas when you<br>look at the see plant forward we got<br>because it's unusual there's not not<br>many foods with that beautiful silver<br>color on the underside Maori used it too<br>of course for finding their way through<br>the forest see put the silver side up<br>it'll catch the moonlight no or the<br>light and you can find your way in the<br>semi dark I'm always impressed we have<br>silver fins growing outside to popper in<br>the little native plant area that we've<br>got there and the most questions we get<br>are always about the silver fin what is<br>it why have you got that white color on<br>the underneath and so on people are just<br>fascinated by it it's not unique of<br>course there are ferns and other parts<br>of the world that have a silver<br>underside to that this is a tree third<br>tree ferns themselves are something<br>special I mean they hardly exist in the<br>northern hemisphere so northern for<br>northern hemisphere botanist coming to<br>New Zealand as I did in 1973 see all<br>these tree ferns it was a wonderful<br>sight<br>probably around 50 no not all of those<br>are widespread by any means some of them<br>are just occasional ones that maybe crop<br>up once or twice but I mean there are<br>some serious weeds like salad janela<br>salvinia the which has been a declared a<br>noxious weed and there's we've mostly<br>got rid of it thank goodness but you<br>know waterways were covered in this damn<br>thing and in the in the tropics it's a<br>that's a huge weed things like dry Optra<br>saphenous and dry out dress Felix mess<br>though this spreading and becoming a<br>quite serious problem so I suppose we've<br>probably got 15 or 20 that are<br>significant weeds<br>oh yes absolutely yeah I think I mean<br>the food and I think was important for<br>Maori and that spread through to to the<br>European culture and the fact that it<br>was so prominent as in as a design<br>element in in all of the work yet that<br>fed through and and the fact that there<br>well I'm surprised I think is the wave<br>yes yes yeah because I mean I was<br>brought up with ferns and fern allies<br>and now a lot of those fern allies are<br>actually fins and that's that's what<br>molecular biology has done for us it's<br>shown us that the DNA is more similar to<br>ferns than we thought I still struggle<br>with horse tails as being true fins but<br>they are right at the base of the<br>lineage and yeah I mean if you look in<br>the fossil floor of this of very strange<br>things going on there - there were a lot<br>of gymnosperms which had foliage that<br>now they're not firms they're giving us<br>boobs yeah yeah yeah so you know down at<br>the the basal level there there's a lot<br>of very very strange plants but horse<br>tails are particularly peculiar but of<br>course back in the fossil flora you get<br>now one endemic genus yeah yeah<br>probably Australia most of our ferns<br>have actually come from Australia the<br>predominant wind is from the West and so<br>the ferns are coming across I mean at<br>one time course when when we were all<br>joined up the same ferns would have<br>occupied New Zealand Australia<br>Antarctica you know the whole of<br>Gondwana<br>but that split 70 million years ago and<br>I think there's very few foods that have<br>survived from that time I think most of<br>New Zealand's flora has blown in mostly<br>from Australia but some have come down<br>from the Pacific a few of CAM ran from<br>the the 730 so that yeah the closest<br>relationship is with Australia I think<br>from memory there's 90 species that we<br>share of those 200 species we've got 90<br>shared with Australia and there's maybe<br>15 or 20 Pacific tropical Pacific things<br>that come down into New Zealand and<br>they're probably only found in the far<br>north of New Zealand or in the thermal<br>areas where they can keep their feet<br>warm in winter but again molecular<br>biology has shown us that there are a<br>few firms that have gone the other way<br>against the prevailing wind a selenium<br>puckery Arnim which is a very common<br>thing here but a rare fern in Australia<br>we now know has gone back the other way<br>and there are one or two other ones that<br>okay I'd like to say thank you very much<br>if you know combine the knowledge of<br>botany with a wonderful magical<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
