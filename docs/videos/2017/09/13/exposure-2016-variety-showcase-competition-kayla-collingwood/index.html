translation: How text in translation affects the transmission of meaning in vocal music.’</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening ladies and gentlemen my<br>name is Kayla Collingwood and I'm a<br>master of music student before studying<br>classical performance voice I'm a mezzo<br>soprano classical singer my research<br>focuses on translations and how they<br>utilized in the repertoire of the<br>classical vocal world this topic came<br>about as I earlier in the year performed<br>a role in New Zealand operas production<br>of Mozart's The Magic Flute and it was<br>performed in English it's very common<br>for foreign language operas to be<br>translated into various languages in<br>order to make the work more accessible<br>songs are also commonly translated and<br>have been throughout history this is<br>most commonly done by either translating<br>pre-existing literary works or<br>translating something in a way that fits<br>with music when it's a language which<br>has already been set to music and also<br>sometimes the texts are transmitted to<br>the audience through the use of<br>surtitles an opera or translations in<br>the program tonight I would like to<br>share with you revolves Sean populaire a<br>set of songs by French composer Maurice<br>Ravel they were their respective winners<br>in the 1910 mizzen do lead composition<br>competition and Moscow the four songs<br>are settings of existing folk songs and<br>are four different dialects collision<br>llamosa Neapolitan and Yiddish as part<br>of the competition the songs are also<br>published with Russian and French<br>translations and I have looked at the<br>French specifically the Spanish<br>translation into French is interesting<br>is it is very different and the Hebrew<br>song that combines both Yiddish and<br>Hebrew and has completely different<br>origins to the other dialects I will be<br>performing them in my recital in<br>December as well so if you want to hear<br>them again you can come on and they also<br>a case study on my thesis they will be<br>performed in the original languages and<br>unfortunately as we were unable to get a<br>piano in here I've had to do<br>a recorded performance this morning very<br>last minute so be with me with the<br>quality and yeah I'll just go and play<br>I was just wondering how do you find<br>these pieces if sung in say the French<br>translations versus the well the Russian<br>for example which we obviously haven't<br>heard but you know how do they function<br>differently I had a go at singing them<br>through in French and it's very<br>different particularly for that one it's<br>just a completely different language<br>structure and there's so much history<br>behind the language as well you can't<br>compare the two really and translation<br>itself is such an art as you can never<br>get a perfect translation so you're<br>always going to lose some of the essence<br>that you get in the original language<br>the Spanish one there is the Spanish and<br>the French although they're fairly<br>similar in origin they're both Latin<br>based languages I don't know what the<br>French decided to do about the story is<br>completely different and at the very end<br>of that one there's a line about they go<br>like roses and they return like Negros<br>to do with a color of the skin obviously<br>and somehow the French ended up talking<br>about that they go like roses and they<br>come back like thorns so there's things<br>like that which just you lose the entire<br>sense of what the Spanish was trying to<br>say oh thank you very much it was it<br>would have been great to see the<br>performance live this and when you talk<br>about lost in translation you also lose<br>a little bit I think when you see it on<br>the screen and love is in and real life<br>but I mean given the limitations of<br>Albania it's a bit of a shame your<br>research does touch upon a very<br>important point and there anybody who's<br>dealing with the need to translate<br>material as especially if you're in the<br>humanities dealing with our ancient<br>languages is always a problem of trying<br>to get the feeling of the original<br>meaning across and to the whatever<br>language you're translating alone but a<br>new okay<br>this is gonna sound very simple saying<br>excuse me my esteemed colleagues what<br>good news still maintains the original<br>language but provide the audience with a<br>translated copy I mean that way you'd<br>still be able to keep the original yet<br>still potentially get the meaning of<br>crossings in a way yes you can do that<br>and they often do often you'll have the<br>translations in the printed program or<br>above the stage the feedback that we<br>often get about that is that it's<br>distracting and when it comes to being<br>the program a lot of people don't<br>actually read the programs so that is a<br>problem as well yes if you're an<br>academic can you arrive in plenty of<br>time for the concert you can we can give<br>was<br>yes and no this when you're translating<br>you can choose whether to use a more<br>harsh word or gentler word related to<br>the context of the audience you're<br>trying to reach that particular<br>translation that we used was by a<br>Scottish translator and he wrote it for<br>a specific kind of audience a lot of<br>people did find that it was difficult to<br>hear those concepts of racism and sexism<br>so thrust in your face whereas you can<br>hide away from it a bit more when it's<br>another in another language it was<br>always written into the story of the<br>Magic Flute but you can't hide from it<br>when it's in your own language so it's<br>out in itself is a translation of the<br>message</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
