presents 'Vitamin D supplimentation: Is it safe?'</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Oh<br>thank you very much sir in touch and<br>welcome questions so many supplements<br>and I felt better in at all<br>shouldn't I be worried about safety of<br>the supplementation baby yes ladies and<br>gentlemen my name is Avinash Malini from<br>a school of population health I am doing<br>the research on the safety of long term<br>large dose vitamin D supplementation so<br>what I'm a part of a bigger group b does<br>study villi study has a started small<br>six years ago in 2010 with Professor<br>overspray is five million dollars fund<br>unprecedented scale for New Zealand and<br>around the world really big randomized<br>control trials to look into the impact<br>of health impact of vitamin D<br>supplementation on participants aged<br>between 50 to 84 so what was the primary<br>outcomes of velocity it was to see<br>whether supplements vitamin D<br>supplementation can decrease the risk of<br>cardiovascular diseases in the first<br>place and secondly with whether it can<br>decrease the risk of acute respiratory<br>infections Falls and fractures but where<br>does my study stands for it had also<br>some sub studies safety was one of them<br>so as well as it's important to say<br>there is a benefit it's very important<br>to see the side effects or safety part<br>of these implementations is there any<br>side effects so yeah there as I told you<br>it was a randomized control trial with<br>two arms<br>from this 5100 people half of them were<br>randomized to vitamin D and the other<br>half were randomized to control placebo<br>but none of them knew which capsule<br>they're taking because it was double<br>going ones as well as them even<br>investigators didn't know that so I<br>wanted to see if side-effects was<br>weighing like like this towards vitamin<br>D or like this or they were evenly<br>distributed between these two but what<br>were my instruments as I told you it was<br>a large randomized control trial with<br>vitamin D supplementation they gave all<br>participants for three to four years 2.5<br>milligram vitamin d3 every month with<br>these monthly capsules that they were<br>sending to participants they also gave<br>them this monthly questionnaire where<br>they could report their health status<br>where I could get the side effects that<br>they were reporting as well as that they<br>were they had done this based on<br>comprehensive based on assessments<br>clinical and biochemical assessments as<br>well as interviews in that interview<br>they asked them about their lifestyle<br>physical activity sun exposure and all<br>the medical history that they had and<br>their medications so all these databases<br>help me to be in to have enough<br>instruments to do further research how<br>about side effects what kind of side<br>effects should I be expecting so I felt<br>okay I have to go to the literature but<br>I biggest asymmetric review of all<br>randomized control trials that had at<br>least given their participants 6 months<br>of supplementation I thought again 6<br>months should be enough time to have any<br>side effects reported and also I<br>included all those studies I took this<br>from I know all those studies with<br>vitamin D provided that it didn't give<br>calcium in one arm if they did haven't<br>given this card<br>intelligible so moving on to my<br>systematic review I found 1,800 articles<br>after exclusion I ended up having<br>hundred 21 studies I used information<br>about side effects promises indeed<br>studies entered it into a reprieve you<br>manager review manager calculated the<br>rest of the thing for me a statistical<br>things so as you can see down there<br>it gave me risk ratio of giving for<br>example in distance hypercalcemia of<br>giving up supplementation and<br>experiencing hypercalcemia in this<br>system it had increased hypercalcemia<br>open over all these studies that<br>reported hypercalcemia the same thing<br>the same first but for other outcomes<br>like dermatological outcomes GI<br>gastrointestinal symptoms and other the<br>same thing it gave me so it was enough<br>information for me to move on to my<br>study so why would Vedas study what did<br>I find<br>in the preliminary results that I get I<br>found that 260 people in vitamin D<br>versus 245 in plus ever reported side<br>effects it was statistically<br>significantly not an aesthetically<br>significant difference actually there<br>the scale was quite similar between two<br>arms but I thought what about the time<br>where there are more participants<br>reported side effects later in the study<br>or not how about difference between<br>these two arms so as you can see the<br>broken red line represents vitamin D<br>while the blue line represents placebo<br>on the y axis you can see frequency of<br>side effects it's quite similar isn't it<br>it's very similar I don't see any<br>difference if there is so I thought if<br>there is like side effects reported it<br>shouldn't be really related to vitamin D<br>so what else I have to dig quite a lot<br>into this research using those databases<br>looking into like lifestyle factors<br>variables and other variables and<br>rather probably their sun exposure<br>socioeconomic factors and other factors<br>affected reproaching these side effects<br>so that's me that's my research I would<br>like to thank my supervisors and my<br>college institutions in Department of<br>Epidemiology and biostatistics school of<br>pollution health thank you very much<br>apologies for interrupting your<br>presentations we welcome questions now<br>for her ok<br>placebo is not actually a drug it's<br>quite similar to the drug we are giving<br>them so they can distinguish between<br>these two so any drug in interventional<br>studies they should have a placebo so<br>that the participants can't you know<br>can't report something that is from the<br>perception of knowing that they're on<br>that drug yeah so it helps in yeah<br>helps in clinical trials it's I don't<br>think so no no you guys got it all time<br>yeah that's right um I've got a question<br>sorry over here how prevalent is the use<br>of vitamin D supplements in New Zealand<br>I am not quite sure to be honest I can't<br>remember I'm sure that I did a review<br>but to be honest I don't have this the<br>answer to this question exactly I mean<br>it must be a problem that you study it<br>is a problem because about 65 percent of<br>New Zealanders have normal vitamin D<br>status but others didn't I don't have<br>and this vitamin D deficiency means like<br>about 35 person have deficiency it's<br>amazing because we have really good<br>sunlight here but in you know we did a<br>scare of getting skin cancer and high<br>prevalence of skin cancer in New Zealand<br>people obviously don't go out as much as<br>they have to to get enough vitamin D one<br>of us is going to ask screen question<br>and pretty much the factors New<br>Zealand's quite a dangerous environment<br>when it gets yes sir yeah exactly<br>research had proven that a vitamin D<br>supplement patients we have unsafe it<br>was that a concern for you yeah yeah<br>concern for everyone I guess yeah yeah<br>but yeah up to this point right I mean<br>II was quite safe yeah yet to be honest<br>if if you can be outside<br>I mean unprotected for 10 minutes<br>everyday during like 10 10 o'clock a.m.<br>to 4 o'clock p.m. you can't get enough<br>vitamin D from Sun and you know you know<br>in real life you you are busy during<br>that time so you can't get yeah get out<br>the Sun this leads to my question in<br>your performance and had you put it on<br>sunscreen yes has the Sun safe message<br>had a direct impact on vitamin D in New<br>Zealand is there a direct correlation<br>that we're fixing one problem and<br>creating another yeah yeah actually<br>sunscreen can block the amount of UVB<br>you can get from sun that helps your<br>skin to it to make vitamin D into your<br>body yeah it can blocks it depends on<br>how much sunscreen you apply obviously<br>but yeah yeah thank you very much serene<br>touch for that presentation</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
