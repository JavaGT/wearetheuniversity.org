widow Pomona<br>wa bro rocket Adama tena koe totin okoto<br>tena tato katoa good evening my name is<br>Harlan hain and I have the great<br>privilege of being the vice chancellor<br>here at the University of Otago and I<br>would like to warmly welcome each and<br>every one of you to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture for professor<br>Richard Blakey I would like to extend<br>the welcome to both professional and<br>academic staff at the University of<br>Otago and the students who are here in<br>the audience and I'd also like to extend<br>that welcome to members of the general<br>public who have also joined us in this<br>celebration but I would like to extend a<br>particularly special welcome to members<br>of Richards family his wife Nicola and<br>his children Daniel Peter and Sophia<br>it's fantastic to have you here and I'd<br>like to give a message to the Blakey<br>family from the University we are all<br>very well aware that we get more than<br>our fair share of Richards time and we<br>are extremely delighted that you can all<br>be with us here this evening to<br>celebrate with us now I'm like most of<br>our inaugural professorial lectures we<br>are actually not here to mark Richard's<br>promotion to Professor Richard actually<br>achieved that rank a decade ago as many<br>of you will be aware Richard came to<br>Otago in 2011 from the McDermott<br>Institute to take up the role of deputy<br>vice-chancellor research and Enterprise<br>and in his role as DB search DVC<br>research and Enterprise Richard spends<br>considerable amounts of time promoting<br>and celebrating other people's research<br>but tonight the tables are turned and<br>this is our chance to promote and<br>celebrate Richards research now part of<br>the special character of the University<br>of Otago is that we expect all of our<br>senior academic administrators to remain<br>active scholars this requirement has<br>become such a fundamental part of our<br>ethos that we sometimes forget how hard<br>it actually is to achieve but in taking<br>the role of DB CRNA Richard Berry warmly<br>embraced our challenge<br>in addition to his relentless job in the<br>clock tower which often begins before<br>dawn and ends long after dark he still<br>continues to maintain a world-class<br>research program and supervise students<br>here at the University of Otago now<br>those of you who know Richard will know<br>that he is insanely curious he reads<br>widely and he draws inspiration from a<br>wide range of sources he's not only<br>smart but he is also energetic<br>enthusiastic strategic and fiercely<br>proud of the University of Otago he is<br>an outstanding leader and it has been a<br>joy to work across the hall for him for<br>the past six years so professor Blakey<br>on behalf of the University of Otago I<br>would like to warmly invite you to give<br>your inaugural professorial lecture but<br>before you do so I will invite the pro<br>vice-chancellor of Sciences professor<br>Richard Barker to tell us just a little<br>bit more about your academic journey<br>noreda tena koe tu tena koe tu tena tato<br>katoa<br>tonight boy bus Chancellor quite<br>professor Blakey tonight koto Katara<br>it's my pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight Professor Richard Blakey<br>to give us an oral professora lecture at<br>the University of Otago as an alumnus of<br>both the kaikoura Valley College and the<br>University of Otago professor Blakey is<br>well acquainted with both the city of<br>Dunedin and our University as a note<br>agha undergraduate professor Blakey<br>chose physics as his field study one of<br>the foundation disciplines of the<br>University of Otago when it was<br>established nearly 150 years ago after<br>graduating with first class honours<br>professor Blakey was awarded a<br>Rutherford memorial scholarship to<br>attend the University of Cambridge and<br>he graduated with his PhD in 1992 after<br>a year at the high touchy Cambridge<br>Laboratory professor Blakey took up a<br>lectureship at the University of<br>Canterbury well forgive him for that<br>in 1994 rapidly rose through the ranks<br>was appointed professor in 2007 and<br>served the University of Canterbury till<br>he left in 2011 during his time at<br>Canterbury he found at the time to be a<br>Fulbright fellow at the Massachusetts<br>Institute of Technology which which took<br>place in 2001 when the McDermott<br>Institute for Advanced Materials and<br>nanotechnology was formed in 2002<br>professor Blakey was appointed deputy<br>director under professor Paul Callaghan<br>a name that evokes powerful memories for<br>the New Zealand science community when<br>Professor Callaghan retired in 2008<br>professor Blakey was appointed director<br>of their Institute and he held that<br>position until he was enticed south to<br>take on the role of deputy<br>vice-chancellor research and Enterprise<br>at the University of Otago in December<br>2011 succeeding our present<br>vice-chancellor professor Blakey's<br>research which we are about to hear<br>about his award winning in 2001 he<br>received the TK Society medal from the<br>Royal Society of New Zealand and was<br>elected fellow of<br>that society in 2011 in 2013 professor<br>Blakey received the Hector memorial<br>medal from the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand the citation reading for his<br>fundamental and wide-ranging<br>contributions to the field of nano<br>optics showing that light can be<br>manipulated at scales much smaller than<br>its wavelength and providing a<br>world-first demonstration of a<br>controversial super lean system using<br>sub-wavelength techniques in addition to<br>his personal scholarship professor<br>Blakey has been a scientific leader in<br>the broadest sense this was given due<br>recognition by the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand in 2015 when he was awarded the<br>Thompson medal for science leadership<br>tonight professor Blakey will be talking<br>about his research journey which began<br>here at Otago with his honours project<br>in the UK and the late 1980s through his<br>time as a graduate research student and<br>then into industry research in the UK<br>and back to his development as an<br>academic researcher in New Zealand first<br>at the University of Canterbury but most<br>importantly at Otago this will cover<br>work on the physics and engineering of<br>systems using atoms electrons in<br>exploring ways that the fundamental<br>limits of such systems can be reached<br>Kiriko takutai thank you very much<br>having and thank you very much Richard<br>look I I am probably don't need to say<br>too much now I think it's all gonna be<br>downhill from there<br>actually I'm reminding me about my<br>Fulbright at MIT that was for six months<br>from with Nicola in the very young<br>annual from July to December 2001 that<br>was three months in one nation before<br>9/11 and three months in a nut in a<br>different nation after 9/11 and so I<br>could give another lecture on me again<br>acknowledging you Nicola and kids the<br>amount that you do to help me be curious<br>and explore things is immeasurable so so<br>thank you thank you thank you very much<br>no podía how called quarter on e e we<br>called car pocket america time manga<br>called calculate our hey camera here how<br>to party wanna go taco tena koutou tena<br>koutou tena koutou katoa<br>I give up me he on my Dunedin me he<br>because I was born up here I was born a<br>little bit further south but my my<br>growing up on my memories are of the<br>city and of this place looking up to<br>mount Cargill and schools at Kenya or<br>intermediate Carvelli high school as it<br>was then and it's beautiful to be back<br>and see the city transformed and now<br>blossoming very much I'm gonna tell you<br>about a journey a journey from my days<br>from when I really began as a researcher<br>through my career there and back again<br>and please excuse any any very weak<br>literary comes along the way it's gonna<br>be a story in in four parts it's got a<br>bit beginning a couple of middles in an<br>end a formative time from a distant<br>millennium my early days my quantum<br>electronics perience is in Cambridge<br>engineering and optical transformation<br>there's another transformation from a<br>physicist to an engineer and back again<br>nano optics new otago but before that I<br>think there is an elephant in the room<br>that we have to discuss why now for an<br>IPO I have been here for nearly six<br>years and I have one could say ducked<br>and dodged<br>that's a little bit but actually I think<br>there is this is actually a very very<br>very fine week for me I'm really proud<br>and I think that we should have a toe<br>tag are the ability to create new<br>tradition so I'd like to promote propose<br>a new tradition and I may even bring<br>this to the Senate that no one should be<br>allowed to give an IPL at the University<br>of Otago and Otago until they have had<br>at least one PhD student go successfully<br>through the whole process and I'm very<br>pleased to announce to you that my first<br>Otago only PhD student Levi Burke who<br>submitted in July just this week had his<br>Corrections for his PhD thesis accepted<br>and he won't unfortunately graduate this<br>week but I'm looking forward to being up<br>on the stage when he graduates some<br>so with that explanation professor<br>Campbell hunt I think we we have we have<br>we may take that to the Senate at least<br>let's make that an informal tradition<br>but back to the story at the start of<br>the story my journey in research started<br>here at the University of Italian in in<br>the late 1980s and actually I still have<br>my undergraduate honors thesis project<br>report and I will take you through some<br>of the key findings from my first<br>research project and some look at some<br>of the lessons that I've learned some of<br>the people that have inspired there and<br>also talk about some of the ways that's<br>helped to shape my career like to<br>firstly acknowledge down on the lower<br>left there Professor Ian Hodgkinson Ian<br>wasn't involved directly in my research<br>supervision but Ian in made the most<br>fantastic optics experiments that we<br>went through as an undergraduate that<br>really that really turned me on to<br>optics and and helped cement my<br>decisions to continue on an enormous<br>degree in physics Ian is someone who<br>I've worked with a lot and in fact ian<br>is a key contributor to the revised PhD<br>thesis that has just gone through so I<br>owe a lot to Ian for my for my research<br>journey Rob Bella Robby you here tonight<br>I think I saw you coming in Rob I owe<br>you a lot a huge amount that treatment<br>of me as a as a junior colleague in the<br>research group bringing me into ever<br>into weekly meetings hearing the senior<br>members discuss research topics I<br>distinctly remember that the problems I<br>was doing theory work but when the laser<br>tubes broke down and there was $30,000<br>and we were going to get $30,000 and how<br>would we go to the University Grants<br>Committee to get that money gave me a<br>very good experience to some of the the<br>practical issues that were were would<br>concern people undertaking research and<br>finally pet Langhorne pet Langhorne<br>actually wasn't involved in any of my<br>teaching when I was an undergraduate he<br>apparently and came in 87 I think right<br>at the end but in interacting with pet I<br>saw a new generation of risk of<br>teachers and researchers come to the<br>University of Otago and always<br>remembered very very fondly some of my<br>interactions with pet along the way<br>so people make research but actually<br>there is some technical details in there<br>as well so let's dive into my project at<br>the dynamic behavior of a.j upper equals<br>one half 2j lower equals one half system<br>in an optical ring cavity I think I can<br>sort of still remember the kinds of<br>things that it was about it was about<br>atoms so this is my story about atoms<br>and atoms atoms can be down or they can<br>be up they can be in a ground saddle<br>they can be an excited state and for<br>optics when atoms are in their lower<br>state and light comes along they can<br>excite them that means that the material<br>that you've got can be quite dark it<br>absorbs the light and the light goes<br>into to moving the atoms from down to up<br>but of course in the wonderful world of<br>quantum physics there's also lifts and<br>writes and other in other magical things<br>here depending on on what kind of light<br>we've got in what kind of polarization<br>state we can look at these not just up<br>and down but lift and right type systems<br>when I was looking at this in my neurons<br>thinking man that looks like an old<br>chart so we've got direct reports we've<br>got functional relationships I don't<br>know what these funky double arrows<br>before but I have to I have to come back<br>and say this is not an object this is an<br>atomic level system so we've got a<br>richness of behaviors that can be<br>described and actually atomic systems<br>are very well known but my project<br>involved taking those atoms and putting<br>in them and something called a ring<br>cavity so that rather than shining light<br>through and just having it absorbed or<br>not absorbed we took can take that light<br>and we can recycle it around and have it<br>ringing around in this cavity and even<br>getting some interesting interesting<br>phenomena from combining atoms in an<br>optical ring cavity so what did I find<br>out in my project I I was able to<br>confirm a number of phenomena in this<br>system and I'll go through those with<br>you now the first was something called<br>optical bi-stability optical by<br>stability<br>so we shine put some light in and we<br>take some light out and the kinds of<br>behaviors we get when we take the the<br>the strength of the light at the end<br>input and we go from a very weak input<br>strength to a grease up to a stronger<br>input strength initially we're in the<br>light is weak the atoms are all nicely<br>resting in their ground state and so the<br>atoms absorb light and we don't get much<br>light out so it's a in a dark state as<br>we increase the amount of the intensity<br>of the input light we get to the point<br>where actually some of the light gets<br>through and it starts to reinforce<br>itself going round and round in this<br>ring cavity so all of a sudden almost<br>instantaneously all of the atoms go into<br>it's more transparent state and the<br>system switches from dark to light if we<br>then reduce the reduce the intensity of<br>the input light we go down beyond that<br>point and in fact now there is<br>sufficient energy rattling around in<br>this in the system that it stays<br>transparent until we reach a much lower<br>intensity in which case before we drop<br>down into the dark state one can hope<br>that we would might get perpetual motion<br>but that isn't possible of the of the<br>light rattling around them here and<br>there keeping things transparent forever<br>the important point that this<br>demonstrates is that with a simple group<br>of atoms and some mirrors we can make we<br>can make something that has memory<br>because if we are in between these lower<br>and upper limits at some position the<br>system can be either dark or clear<br>depending on what we did previously if<br>we were previously in the dark state<br>moving up to this point it will stay<br>that we were previously coming from a<br>higher intensity to a lower intensity<br>people stay bright so that that's a<br>basic element that might be needed if we<br>wanted to use light to store information<br>an optical memory there are some<br>interesting behaviors we can observe<br>here if we immediately put the system<br>somewhere in this in this in this little<br>loop I've got a little position mark a<br>it will decide whether it goes into the<br>dark state or the lights state as the<br>light rings around in this cavity and we<br>get some interesting behaviors one I<br>found out was critical critical slowing<br>down where the amount of time that the<br>system takes to determine what its final<br>state will be can very very critically<br>on the on the initial parameters of the<br>system the difference between the<br>initial state of these two lower systems<br>is only about one part in 1500 so it<br>takes twice as long to switch in these<br>two states between these two conditions<br>with only a less than 0.1% difference in<br>the input conditions again this that's<br>of some interest particularly if we<br>wanting to do some processing with these<br>optical systems we want to make sure we<br>know how long the systems are going to<br>take for any action to occur more<br>interestingly for the project with these<br>four level systems the light can come in<br>two flavors it can come and left-handed<br>or right-handed and that really<br>describes the propagation of light as<br>either a right-handed helix a right<br>handed screw or a left-handed screw when<br>it's traveling from one place to another<br>and these systems have a richness of<br>behavior here we're showing what happens<br>as the strength of the left-handed light<br>compared to the strength of the<br>right-handed light in these systems and<br>very often there is always a trivial<br>solution that says okay it can be left<br>equals right that's the red line but the<br>system can also decide at different<br>times to switch to favor the<br>right-handed light or the left-handed<br>light again depending on critical<br>critical initial conditions and one of<br>the and that that's switching between a<br>left-handed state or a right-handed<br>state could be used for performing<br>logical operations we've got now two<br>different states that could represent a<br>logical one or a logical zero if we're<br>wanting to do some processing the final<br>thing that I found is that in some cases<br>in some very special cases that involved<br>a lot of late nights in the computer<br>laboratories in science 3 getting<br>very very frustrated we can find some<br>conditions where the system can't<br>actually decide whether it wants to be<br>left or right there are a number of<br>cases where starting off in some<br>indeterminate case it'll go alive be be<br>a little bit left a little bit right<br>I'll go the other way I'll go the other<br>way oh well I think I'll start to<br>oscillate an inn bang it goes lyft<br>dominating overwrite or it might go the<br>other way eventually I discovered that<br>there are some certain circumstances<br>under which the system can get into a<br>self-sustained oscillation left right<br>left right left right left right left<br>right which is again if one is making a<br>computer out of these optical and atomic<br>systems is another necessary component<br>for optical computing which is the clock<br>that's going to time operations so the<br>results of my first experience from<br>research here at the University of Otago<br>in these atomic systems was to<br>demonstrate that through simple optics<br>and atoms you can get all of the<br>necessary components for a computer you<br>can have memory logic you can get fast<br>or slow switching and you can have clock<br>operations and that was quite a<br>satisfying experience and it resulted in<br>me getting a very good grade and I was<br>very happy and I got a scholarship to go<br>to Cambridge and so it was actually a<br>pretty important part of my development<br>the final story about that was the<br>University was very kind and offered<br>while I was waiting to hit or overseas<br>to fund through a summer student ship<br>time for me to do some work helping to<br>develop some undergraduate experiments<br>as well as that my task was to write<br>this worker as a paper for submission to<br>a journal and I have a folder it's<br>called write-up and I did that I wrote a<br>manuscript and I have it here and it's<br>got diagrams and figures and it's got an<br>abstract it I couldn't actually find a<br>title but it's got all those necessary<br>components the one thing that it doesn't<br>have it didn't get put on an envelope<br>with a stamp on and gets submitted to a<br>journal so I still have from my<br>undergraduate time here a manuscript in<br>preparation<br>so I'm very very suspicious when I see<br>people put on their CVS menu script and<br>preparation that it does not count for<br>naught<br>it does not count for North I'm also<br>very pleased that here at the University<br>of Otago we have a more formal<br>postgraduate publishing bursary scheme<br>for our graduate students that also<br>requires that the final payment has the<br>manuscript submitted for publication<br>before the final payment is awarded so<br>there was a wonderful experience and<br>actually this was a different time in<br>the city where when when the university<br>was a little bit smaller but when<br>students lift the university it was<br>celebrated in the Otago daily times but<br>actually it was celebrated and only the<br>the only only the ways that Theo tiger<br>daily times can celebrate things not<br>saying goodbye a university but goodbye<br>supermarket<br>I also through my time here helped<br>support myself through a part-time job<br>and it was leaving my part-time job that<br>was much more of a public interest story<br>then leaving the University so I you<br>know it's nice to keep these kind of<br>reflections and call upon them I reflect<br>now when I return to the University I<br>figure out I think I've obviously<br>transformed him to a monster on the way<br>through because I I was the subject of<br>an ODT article when I returned in 2011<br>that was related to the animal research<br>at the University and put my name I saw<br>alongside some some some astounding<br>headline that basically demonstrated how<br>evil I had become so moving on hello<br>Cambridge quantum electronics periences<br>so my undergraduate research experience<br>set me up very well to go somewhere else<br>and do something else<br>in fact in discussion with Rob and<br>others I had a scholarship that the<br>requirement was to study in the UK and<br>because I only knew of two universities<br>in the UK I had to decide which one I<br>went to the physics department has very<br>strong links had very strong links with<br>Oxford so I went to Cambridge<br>and Rob gave me some very good advice<br>and in the kinds of things I was wanting<br>to think of doing I've just really<br>wanted to do something different I<br>thought about fusion research new forms<br>of energy for the future Rob gave me<br>some very good advice I think the two<br>words he used our bomb research so I<br>decided not to do that but I ended up<br>accepting a position at the micro<br>electronics Research Group at in the<br>Department of Physics at the University<br>of Cambridge but I look I still have the<br>kinds of project I could have the world<br>was my oyster there was some fantastic<br>projects I could have chosen I just<br>wanted to share with you one I didn't<br>choose really pleased to go to a place I<br>didn't see that I could have been<br>supervised by a Nobel laureate and I<br>thought man that could be good but when<br>I read the project I think I put a cross<br>beside it here's the project recent<br>research has thrown light on the<br>question of the extent to which quantum<br>theory can be an adequate theory of all<br>natural phenomena sounds ok<br>and it's produced tentative proposals to<br>show how the domains of matter life and<br>mind may be related together hmm<br>mind metaphysics I didn't quite think<br>that relying or knowing psychic<br>phenomena to do the laws of quantum<br>physics for was we're right projects are<br>available in this general area for up to<br>two suitably qualified students so I I<br>think I chosen it wisely not to go into<br>that area and when I got to Cambridge I<br>realize that there that was somewhat<br>marginal I chose a group though that was<br>related to micro electronics looking at<br>electronic systems rail and optical<br>systems through which our our global<br>computer industry is built hmm I have to<br>pay particular acknowledgement to my<br>supervisor their doctor their professor<br>who nammed the group leader as he was<br>then Haroon taught me a lot a lot about<br>science and engineering but actually<br>quite a lot more about politics<br>relationships and fundraising when I got<br>to this group he was able to you know be<br>very convincing he gave me a very<br>convincing argument why why I should<br>join this group he didn't tell me that<br>they just lost all<br>the funding from all of the British<br>industries that had been in the in the<br>micro electronics area British Telecom<br>General Electric and others when I got<br>there every second light bulb had been<br>pulled out than the lads to save money<br>we had to switch machines off at night<br>so that we didn't rake up the power bill<br>but what Haroon did through very good<br>diplomatic skills actually through his<br>honed his home talents for golf and<br>other extracurricular activities he went<br>on a road trip and managed to get a<br>Japanese company Hitachi to come and<br>invest at the University of Cambridge<br>and set up a new lab and get the group<br>funded in a sustainable way I was very<br>fortunate to be one of the first<br>students involved in that collaboration<br>so Hintz was able to get a job with that<br>group after graduation just one other<br>little highlight from that when I think<br>oh look isn't it nice to be in a stable<br>research career I think of who was the<br>most successful of my contemporaries<br>from that time in that group and it has<br>been Johnny English Miller his PhD topic<br>in quantum physics was novel quantum<br>effects in low-temperature quasi zero<br>dimensional mesoscopic electron systems<br>and of course were there as your project<br>there was only one career that you can<br>have and that's starring beside Ron<br>Atkinson and the Johnny englishmen<br>movies and and having his own show on<br>BBC what Ben showed me though was that<br>he actually made a very brave decision<br>and he he did not complete his ph.d he<br>is one of a one of a number of people<br>around the world that was going on a<br>pathway where he had other interest in<br>life he was in the Cambridge Footlights<br>and when the opportunity came for him to<br>to realize a dream in that part and an<br>ambition in that area of his life he<br>made the decision and he pursued that<br>with success so again it's that research<br>is very important to me but there are<br>other things that that we should keep<br>interested in ah in a second aside look<br>this is this is a little bit distracting<br>in looking at all of these photographs<br>it is very clear that it is it was a<br>distant millennium that last millennium<br>particularly in physical sciences and<br>engineers<br>was a very very male-dominated time I've<br>got some wonderful people who have<br>guided me along the way but they have<br>almost without exception being male and<br>that's just because of the cohorts that<br>were in physics and engineering at that<br>time I'm really really pleased that now<br>here at the University of Otago we are<br>the host of a national center of<br>research excellence and photonic and<br>quantum technologies the Dodd Wall<br>Center and when we look at our research<br>group photographs yes I am still there<br>actually in about the same position<br>third row back in the middle because I'm<br>a little taller than most people but the<br>leadership is much more diverse and so I<br>think we are entering a new age of<br>physical sciences where we embrace<br>diversity is much more naturally however<br>the people that I will talk to you about<br>as role models will still be typically<br>male because though there is a time that<br>I went through the system okay now to<br>now to Cambridge I did a PhD and I'm not<br>going to tell you about that project but<br>I just wanted I just want to highlight<br>one of the other projects that I was<br>involved with that I that was exciting<br>to be involved with and has also formed<br>the kinds of ways I think about research<br>through my engagement with itachi they<br>were a new they were a new group in the<br>UK that had been formed for a number of<br>reasons but - but to promote the<br>strengths in basic science in an<br>industrial research environment in many<br>ways I had more academic freedom working<br>with Hitachi<br>in Cambridge than I've ever had any good<br>idea was worth funding and they had deep<br>pockets at the time I was working with<br>atashi their annual sales were about the<br>same as New Zealand's GDP they invested<br>in research and development 10% of sales<br>and research and development which is<br>not unusual for a for an engineering<br>technology company but of that 10% 10%<br>in went into basic undirected research<br>so one percent of the equivalent of GDP<br>went into blue skies research at that<br>company and we were the fortunate<br>recipients of being the Cambridge<br>laboratory of being able to be<br>unconstrained and our thinking<br>so long as it had something to do with<br>with electronics and engineering so we<br>had through my through one of the lead<br>researchers cazza macca Sato had a bold<br>ambition to say is it possible to get to<br>get electronic memory that stores a bit<br>of information with the presence or<br>absence of one electron the ultimate<br>quantum limit for memory storage and of<br>course you can justify it by saying look<br>we at that time there were memories that<br>were tapes and disks that were<br>high-capacity but very but very slow<br>they were also very high speed memories<br>but they were low capacity can we get<br>high speed and high capacity in a single<br>entity and just a little primer storing<br>a memory system using electronic systems<br>is actually a whole lot easier than if<br>that optical stuff I did when I was here<br>at our target all it requires is<br>essentially a bucket and some tennis<br>balls or a capacitor and electrons if<br>you talking in electronic terms and<br>really all you do in an electronic<br>memory that's on your flash drive or<br>whatever is you're just filling in<br>emptying little buckets with charge and<br>that charge comes along at little<br>packets and they're called electrons and<br>that's all well and good at the time<br>when we were doing this work the<br>technology was a label to make those<br>buckets or those capacitors with us<br>scales down to about a micrometer one<br>one thousandth of a millimeter and<br>typically at that scale when you empty<br>in and fill those buckets you're you're<br>moving about 100,000 electrons at a time<br>and so the statistics of putting tennis<br>balls and buckets as if you do it at the<br>level of a hundred thousand at a time<br>within about 0.1% you get about a<br>hundred thousand every time however as<br>technology was scaling it was very clear<br>that going to smaller dimensions giving<br>faster and lower power devices the<br>ability to get more and more memory on<br>our honor stick so again this whole<br>sixteen gigabit thirty-two gigabit on<br>your flash drive was predicted in these<br>times the problem is when you when you<br>nailed down you also scaled down the<br>number of tennis balls or electrons that<br>you put into the bucket every time and<br>when you get down to about a hundred the<br>the statistics are the same statistics<br>as Colmar Brunton polls and UN errors<br>the the standard deviation goes as a<br>square root of the number so at a<br>hundred electrons you've got a ten<br>percent error so it can be a hundred<br>plus or minus ten so that the that just<br>the natural fluctuations become<br>important and if you get down to one<br>electron yes you might be able to use<br>have a memory that has one electron<br>stored on it but the fluctuation is one<br>so whether you've got a one or a zero is<br>a little bit of a moot point so there<br>was something different needed in order<br>to take traditional scaling and show<br>that you could get electron memories<br>that would be capable of having control<br>at the single electron level and so we<br>did that it was the project that was the<br>brainchild of Nakazato Sam I helped and<br>my supervisor was involved and the<br>critical the critical technology was<br>something called a multiple tunnel<br>junction I won't go into the details<br>with you but rather than rather than<br>bringing the electrons in and out of a<br>storage capacitor through just a<br>straight wire I rode through which the<br>buses can come randomly you put this<br>multiple tunnel Junction in so so the<br>electrons now control themselves and all<br>of themselves and they are they are the<br>inner energies involved in moving the<br>electrons along this chain mean that<br>they can move one at a time rather than<br>as an uncoordinated cohort the<br>prediction for these devices is if you<br>scan the some writing voltage you get to<br>a position where you can literally see<br>the next electron the next electron the<br>next electron and the next electron into<br>the the memory node and when you go back<br>you can push charge out one electron at<br>a time the same kind of cycle site<br>behavior that is is observed in our<br>undergraduate optics experiments of a<br>memory at any particular point there can<br>be two states depending on whether<br>you've gone up the hill or you're back<br>on the down part of the cycle and we<br>were very fortunate to be able to make<br>some devices and measure them and they<br>showed this effect also showed me we<br>were not with this researchers led not<br>took the product that's on the market<br>but it informed some of the more<br>commercially focused teams in Hitachi to<br>go and develop different technology that<br>were more practical and actually it is<br>research that is relevant to current pin<br>drives that we all take around with us<br>but the research that we did has not<br>directly led to something a device that<br>is complicated or or difficult to<br>operate as the particular device that<br>this this these measurements required<br>cooling down to temperatures only point<br>oh three degrees above absolute zero so<br>we were never under any ambition that<br>this was going to be something that was<br>practical we just wanted to demonstrate<br>that there were new ways of doing things<br>and actually our industrial<br>collaborators and the other parts of the<br>company very quickly related to that and<br>they used it to give themselves<br>confidence to develop actually<br>alternative practical strains of these<br>technologies Oh little aside here I I<br>like working for us to hit a key they<br>were they were Japanese company and<br>there was a lot of good traditions from<br>Japan they they were relatively modern<br>but they found her there was a motto<br>that he had or a saying he said though<br>we are not here a hundred years we<br>should think a thousand years hence very<br>forward-looking but at some point they<br>got they got captured by people with<br>brand refreshes and other things so this<br>is their traditional this traditional<br>logo and they're they're their brand<br>name tells that they're a Japanese<br>company this is the current one that was<br>developed after I live to inspire the<br>Nick someone that said you need<br>something that people can relate to you<br>need a tagline inspire the next and I I<br>don't mind<br>Matos I love sapere Aude I love IBM's<br>one think but I hate this one inspire<br>the Knicks what the Knicks ex murderer<br>the next genocide the Knicks who knows<br>so you can do these things well and you<br>can do these things badly but that's<br>another sight so with her with that<br>experience a time came in our lives so<br>this is 93 94 in fact this was published<br>when we had returned to New Zealand the<br>decision was made that you know you can<br>have too much academic freedom you can<br>have too many resources you can be too<br>well looked after and so we made<br>decisions to return to New Zealand in 93<br>94 and then there was a damn moment New<br>Zealand does not have a micro<br>electronics industry so I was doing<br>research in an area and for a company<br>for which there was not a<br>straightforward translation pathway back<br>to New Zealand so I hate to admit it so<br>mmm when all else fails an academic job<br>was something that I was able to go go<br>to I would have happily continued in<br>industrial research but at that time<br>there weren't the opportunities back in<br>New Zealand pleasingly if I was to come<br>back to New Zealand today there would be<br>at least a hundred companies that I<br>could go to with these kind of skills<br>and transfer even though there isn't an<br>electronics and just a micro electronics<br>industry transfer into so I ended up<br>after making some various applications<br>and we we determined that Christchurch<br>wasn't a bad place to be<br>and so I got a job in the electrical<br>engineering department at the University<br>of Kent Canterbury with no formal<br>qualifications in electrical engineering<br>and I really<br>Peter Goff was the head of department at<br>that time I was initially employed as a<br>postdoctoral fellow in his group but<br>then when faculty positions came along I<br>applied and was awarded one Pete was<br>great Pete golfer's most famous for<br>being one of two people to be the first<br>to climb the Caroline face of now cook<br>so he was also someone that was very<br>keen on ensuring that his other<br>interests dovetailed nicely with his<br>academic pursuits Pete also<br>as a young academic gave me some<br>interesting things to read that were<br>non-technical and always remember being<br>given a copy of this book you might like<br>to read this the evolution of<br>cooperation Robert Robert Axelrod was<br>fascinating about the prisoner's dilemma<br>game being used to study cooperation in<br>systems human systems the opening line<br>of which is under what circumstances<br>called does cooperation of all amongst a<br>group of egoists with no central<br>authority and so here I am working in<br>the administration of a university but<br>it is guiding it is does say actually<br>this is about getting people to<br>cooperate it's not about command and<br>control however in that the other advice<br>that Peter gave me was look when we<br>appoint you as a faculty member here yes<br>we do care about your outputs and annual<br>success but I don't really I'm not<br>really going to be monitoring you on a<br>weekly monthly or quarterly basis for<br>the first period get yourself set up it<br>takes three years to get yourself set up<br>take the time and do something by<br>getting bold and ambitious so I I asked<br>a question I really was still interested<br>in this area of microelectronics but<br>because we didn't have an industry and<br>because it was so we needed that what<br>the ability to make these structures I<br>asked the question how can we use light<br>to manufacture small structures to make<br>micro electronics and the answer is yes<br>in the industry the mic the<br>semiconductor industry does it every day<br>and they they have what I call I call<br>high cost micro lithography systems and<br>it's very straightforward it's its<br>high-end printers and cameras they are<br>made by companies like Nikon and Canon<br>that make good consumer cameras they<br>have lenses and they taken an image and<br>projected onto a substrate however it<br>wasn't so feasible to set up a research<br>activity in that area because then in a<br>manufacturing level any one of these<br>lenses can cost up to 20 or 15 million<br>dollars so I asked the question how<br>could you do<br>low-cost optical nano lithography and<br>again had the ambition to say look are<br>there other ways that we can make small<br>structures using light that don't<br>require a 20 million dollar lens and the<br>answer was very simple I'll give a brief<br>description of it is you simply take the<br>lens out of the system and you take<br>whatever you want to print and put it in<br>contact with what you want to print it<br>on and you shine light through it and<br>bingo you can print small structures if<br>you do the things in the right way I was<br>very very fortunate that I started this<br>work when the Marsden fund was starting<br>and whilst I failed on my first attempt<br>at getting funding from the Mars and<br>fund for something different that was I<br>I can tell you over a drink out later<br>what that project would have been I was<br>successful in the second attempt and it<br>was for this optical nano lithography ee<br>fortunately after that to get good<br>people to work on this on this project<br>sherry McNab my first PhD student and<br>man al Casey who worked as a<br>postdoctoral fellow on that both have<br>gone to very successful careers I should<br>say sherry McNab is now doing work on<br>power electronics real real real<br>engineering work but she gained her<br>skills in my lab so what do we do with<br>this low-cost nano lithography we try to<br>replicate the kinds of things the<br>ability to print the kinds of things<br>that are in modern-day microprocessors<br>which are pretty amazing that if you<br>think about what's in your what's in<br>your cell phone or even your key fob<br>there will be little chips in there in<br>many cases now the smaller than the<br>grain of rice the individual wires<br>moving charges around on those will have<br>dimensions measured in a few or a few<br>teams and many meters so we wanted to<br>say well look how does that work because<br>with with op with optics because light<br>has a scale to it and these scales of<br>modern-day micro electronics at a few er<br>a few tens of nanometers which is a few<br>tens of thousands of thousands of<br>millimeters just doesn't work with the<br>scale of light lighter scaled at the<br>head the dimensions of micrometers for<br>those again those doing biological<br>imaging will know<br>the limitations of of emitting even at<br>the shortest wavelengths of visible<br>light and the largest kinds of viral<br>particles we have a missed mismatch by a<br>factor of four these tiny electronic<br>circuit elements the fact the mismatch<br>is a factor of 10 or 20 and even<br>traditional physics tells us that there<br>are fundamental limits to to what we can<br>do with light in star they in the 19th<br>century very clearly showed that using<br>lenses one could not observe two objects<br>more closely spaced than about half the<br>wavelength so at 400 nanometers the<br>minimum spacing between two objects<br>would be about 200 nanometers before the<br>diffraction rings blur each other out<br>and you lose the capability to to<br>resolve two features his his findings<br>were clear and clearly articulated in a<br>formula d is lambda on to inside alpha<br>which describes all of the physics about<br>imaging through lenses and it's was so<br>fundamental that at llena university<br>they itch turd and stone on his memorial<br>outside the department of physics and so<br>what we tried to sit about to do was to<br>say actually hmm here we've got a<br>microscope that has some object it has<br>some lens isn't it there are well-known<br>limits to how small one can image in<br>those systems what happens if you take<br>the lenses out of the system and have a<br>simple contact printing regime can you<br>get different limits of of resolution<br>particularly if you take your object and<br>put it in the vicinity of your imaging<br>layer ad with with dimensions that are<br>also in the nano scale and we found that<br>yes but you know I wouldn't be telling<br>in this case imaging with wavelengths<br>very easily available from Mercury lamps<br>the kind of lamps that are in street<br>lights through systems that are easily<br>manufactured with relatively crude<br>techniques we could observe feature<br>sizes at or around the 100 nanometer<br>scale using light of 4 to 500 nanometers<br>so we demonstrated that those<br>diffraction limits of our they only<br>apply in those cases where you're<br>imaging through through lenses if you<br>look at other situations the physics is<br>different and the resolution limits can<br>be overcome imaging saans leans we were<br>then very fortunate at the same time<br>there was a resurgence in some physics<br>that was about and this comes to the<br>story of the super liens that that has<br>also been quite defining for my career<br>that thought experiments were undertaken<br>about materials that bent light in<br>strange ways so-called negative<br>refraction materials people had asked in<br>various in various papers what might<br>happen if you made a lens rather than<br>out of a normal material a lens out of a<br>material in which the light waves bent<br>backwards and the light traveled<br>backwards in this material these are<br>thought experiments because there are<br>not natural materials that have these<br>behaviors where you put a straw in a<br>glass made of such a material and the<br>refraction makes the image being<br>backwards on itself but still one can do<br>physics experiments with materials that<br>are not available and one can theorize<br>and postulate what might happen if you<br>have a material in which the light waves<br>refract backwards on themselves then<br>actually a very very simple concept<br>comes in this is a flat lens you just<br>take a block of that material you shine<br>light or you have an object and an image<br>will form both within the material and<br>on the other side of the material and<br>that was well known since the 1960s<br>about the time we were doing our own<br>near field image<br>a paper come out came out of Imperial<br>College by John Hendry that theorized<br>that not only do these flat slab lenses<br>of negative refractive materials give<br>rise to an image so what but their image<br>should have a resolution that is<br>unlimited that they're that flat slab of<br>material should be able to form objects<br>that break our Bayes diffraction limit<br>so again for biological imaging you<br>would just be able to take and put a<br>flat slab of this material above<br>something that had had a cell and be<br>able to observe the proteins in that<br>cell or the sub sub cellular structure<br>with the resolution that wouldn't be<br>available through a normal microscope<br>that piqued our interest because John<br>Pendry also proposed that there was one<br>potential practical implementation of<br>that using a layer of silver in a<br>special configuration that we were able<br>to take our near field imaging<br>experiments modify in a quite quite a<br>straightforward way and hope to<br>determine whether or not these<br>interesting theories of super-resolution<br>imaging out of planar lenses was<br>actually achievable a lesson i learned<br>from this is you take a simple idea we<br>knew about doing these experiments with<br>the so called conformable glass mass we<br>knew about patterning into photo resists<br>hey it's simple we've just got to add a<br>couple of layers put some silver and<br>some spaces on that and off we go what<br>could be simpler it took five years to<br>get the simple experiment to work and we<br>were in a little bit of a race with<br>another group we actually reached the<br>finish line at the same time and so I'm<br>very very proud that what I'm one of my<br>most significant achievement is these<br>fuzzy images of fuzzy lines that as my<br>students is you need your beer goggles<br>on to convince yourself that there's<br>even something there but through these<br>through these papers we were able to<br>provide the first experiment mental<br>demonstration that this theoretical<br>prediction of super-resolution imaging<br>through us<br>both flat layer and material can give<br>that there is another piece of my my<br>research advancement that I'm very proud<br>of another part of the story and back<br>again the opportunity to be involved<br>with the McDermott Institute was<br>wonderful and then the opportunity to<br>come back and work here again at the<br>University of Otago was one that I took<br>up the question was then how can I<br>transform myself back here I was very<br>fortunate that we received funding to be<br>able to set up a lab so it is within<br>this realm of nano optics how do we can<br>how does light work at a scale much less<br>than its wavelength that I continue to<br>work<br>there's Levi and Sam Lowry a postdoc<br>working on on some of the optics that we<br>set up to do these experiments now their<br>target the photo we were able to take<br>those beer goggle images and actually<br>demonstrate that you could make some<br>quite quite decent practical structures<br>here still dimensions below one below or<br>around 100 nanometers but now structures<br>that might be useful for things so in my<br>time here at ah go through the group<br>that we've got we're now looking at<br>applications for these kind of<br>techniques applications for nano optics<br>and sensing in so-called nano get<br>resonators that have interesting<br>scattering properties and it has led me<br>to the conclusion I'm very happy there<br>is still plenty of room at the bottom<br>there is still plenty of work to be done<br>in nano scale optics and I think we're<br>making some good progress here at<br>guitarra the time has come to say some<br>other things and really what are the<br>important things hate anger to hate<br>anger to hate anger the important things<br>of the people that we've worked with<br>along the way I'd like to give special<br>acknowledgment to the graduate students<br>I've had at the University of Canterbury<br>colleagues at the University of<br>Canterbury who helped us<br>be bold enough to think that we could<br>create a national center of research<br>excellence and in particular to students<br>and colleagues here at the University of<br>Otago who are helping me in the few<br>minutes I get in few hours I get in each<br>week to advance those important<br>questions and nano optics vision without<br>funding is a hallucination so it's also<br>important to think the TEC what was the<br>foundation for research science and<br>technology really importantly the<br>Marsden funding as Richard said the<br>Fulbright New Zealand for being able to<br>provide the funding in addition to the<br>institutional funding that has allowed<br>me to to pursue some really really<br>interesting and rewarding research<br>topics before I am in though I got to<br>the end of putting the presentation<br>together and realized that I hadn't<br>acknowledged both Ellen McDermott and<br>Paul Callaghan these are immensely<br>important people for New Zealand<br>research Ellen McDermott in material<br>science had for winning a Nobel Prize<br>Paul for you know for sitting themselves<br>up he could have created his career<br>anywhere he devoted as his research life<br>to to New Zealand and to seeing<br>transformation and New Zealand's<br>research environment<br>he has seeded our tech sector he has<br>done a lot for New Zealand and it was<br>very sad to see his passing in an early<br>stage and when I look back at our<br>applications for Centers of Excellence<br>funding for the McDermott Institute of<br>some of the things that we said and I<br>will just finish with repeating that our<br>aim was to build on that acquire not our<br>Pune the footsteps of our intellectual<br>proceed predecessors and build from that<br>top wire none that mokopuna that the<br>footsteps of it for our intellectual<br>descendants and we're intensely aware of<br>our heritage and a responsibility to<br>live up to those words so with that<br>thank you for listening to me and thank<br>you Richard<br>now focus on me just to say a few words<br>of thanks for which I'm very grateful<br>I'm here acting as head of Department of<br>Physics<br>Craig Roger couldn't be here and also as<br>the director of the Dodd wolves Center<br>which were very proud to have Richard as<br>a part of so Richard started by talking<br>about his project at Otago and his<br>project with Rob Rob Bala he talked<br>about memory and clocks and a<br>manipulation of atoms and putting atoms<br>in cavities and some of the atomic<br>physics he he did here and then a move<br>to Cambridge I can't help but notice<br>that he's twice a tab as someone who's<br>got a got a background with a little bit<br>of darker blue in it but the move to<br>Cambridge ended up with control of<br>electrons and so the activity they're<br>moving from atoms to electrons and<br>actually what you could do with<br>electrons how you could control those<br>those electrons I know he passed up the<br>opportunity to work with Brian Joseph<br>sand on let lets perhaps a loosely call<br>that quantum biology which of course is<br>a another area that we now have some<br>interest in here but um fronting from<br>Cambridge he moved to Canterbury and and<br>we've seen then the the shift to to the<br>nano lithography and and again now more<br>control we've talked about atomic<br>systems we talk about electronic systems<br>are now to control over optical systems<br>and and the reason I I stress this is<br>that control is always a theme across<br>all of all of the elements of Richard's<br>work and I think Yuri Asti is one aspect<br>that drives us all as physicists but the<br>the beauty in modern physics whether<br>it's modern atomic physics electronics<br>or or or the physics of light is around<br>that control and turning what is physics<br>what is curiosity-driven into things<br>that we can actually do and actually<br>doing stuff has been an unlined<br>underline aspect of Richard's career and<br>I think he really has made that<br>transition from quantum physicist into a<br>real quantum engineer who's actually<br>done some really wonderful work that's<br>actually if not directly made devices<br>has led to device or led to our<br>understanding that has led on to<br>ultimately two devices that are<br>affecting all of us and our every day<br>lives and just very syrup or<br>serendipitously I came across a<br>substance today that we've just acquired<br>at the otago museum that is sort of a<br>apart inspired by some of the sorts of<br>things that that Richard is doing in<br>terms of nano lithography<br>and I was driven to think about Richard<br>when I saw this product because I went<br>to the honors project seminars on on<br>Monday and Tuesday where one of his<br>current students is working on I wish we<br>had the slide but he's making these nano<br>well nano ridges if you like in material<br>by doing lithography and if you do it<br>then across ways you can make nano<br>pillars and so you can make these very<br>narrow pillars with with gaps between<br>them and one of the properties of those<br>is if light propagates you can imagine<br>like very tall trees that are very very<br>narrow and tightly put spaced together<br>then the light could sort of percolate<br>down but we'll never get to the bottom<br>so it can never be reflected again and<br>so what I actually have here is a piece<br>of the darkest material the blackest<br>material that is made in the world this<br>is this is the darkest material that you<br>can get you can't take this outside the<br>UK it's on the prescribed export list<br>it's not allowed to be exported you can<br>imagine what they make this for okay<br>military like this kind of thing and so<br>it's not allowed anywhere outside in the<br>UK so we managed to get someone that for<br>so so I encourage you to come it's an<br>amazing piece of material to look at<br>this close-up is really quite remarkable<br>you'll be pleased to hear Craig but<br>so Richard I'd like you to come up and<br>there this is just a small token of our<br>appreciation so thank you so much thank<br>you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
