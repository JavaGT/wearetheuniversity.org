Lecture.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>tena koutou katoa for those those who<br>don't know me I'm David Miller under the<br>beam of the campus here at University of<br>Otago in Christchurch and it's my job to<br>welcome you all got a great turnout<br>today to the inaugural professora<br>lecture by Anthony Butler so this is a<br>very special Grand Rounds it's not the<br>normal Grand Rounds here we're going to<br>celebrate the new professorial<br>appointment on on campus and in that<br>regard I would like to extend a warm<br>welcome to family and friends and<br>colleagues of Anthony too to this event<br>so thank you for coming today and I'm<br>not sure if sparing us here but but<br>thank you to Ruth for deviating from the<br>normal grand round routine to to allow<br>us to have this event now and I think<br>Anthony been a also a consultant<br>radiologist with a District Health Board<br>it was important ever this time to allow<br>staff to come through so thank you to<br>Ruth these inaugural professora lectures<br>and still a great deal of pride and<br>Dean's because we know how much it takes<br>to actually get to to be promoted to<br>professor at the University of Otago<br>which is I should say no mean feat it<br>really is quite a high bar and what it<br>requires for those who don't know it's<br>um fairly clear criteria<br>Anita's show sustained outstanding<br>competence and all of teaching research<br>and service as well as sustained<br>outstanding leadership at least two of<br>those areas and leadership in particular<br>this area that the assessment committees<br>are looking for as a difference from the<br>lists of promotions and s look there's<br>very rigorous process before I invite<br>Anthony to to take the podium I thought<br>I'd just say a few words about his<br>career<br>Anthony graduated from the Otago Medical<br>School in 1998<br>I notice that he had a couple of summer<br>student sips along the way both in<br>medical physics and I guess that's a<br>harbinger of things to come<br>House surgeon in Hawke's Bay before<br>training as a radiologist here in<br>Christchurch 2000 2005 and and during<br>that time taking on additional<br>postgraduate study now that's not<br>actually unusual for budding academics<br>and in fact it's encouraged to take on a<br>higher degree but I guess the difference<br>with with Anthony was in the areas of<br>physics and Electrical and Computer<br>Engineering at the University of<br>Canterbury with a graduate diploma in<br>physics and a PhD in Electrical and<br>Computer Engineering<br>so a good foundation in in physics and<br>bioengineering there after joined the<br>staff here at University of Otago<br>Christchurch as well as a consultant for<br>the District Health Board and I was<br>promoted to associate professor of 2013<br>and professor this year and also<br>importantly for the University in 2014<br>took on the role of head of the<br>department of radiology and for the<br>University like many universities and in<br>the world that the departments that<br>hitted departments a really key role for<br>the function of the university so that's<br>a very varied role to have taken on in<br>2007 anthing also with his father<br>established the Mars program focusing on<br>building spectral CT systems now I'm not<br>I'm gonna leave it to Ed if he's talked<br>to expand on that but just needless to<br>say that this was a has been a very<br>successful program that is that has<br>grown over time that has attracted a<br>considerable external research funding<br>ground from from MB and member of the NZ<br>admit 8-core there's also been a lot of<br>commercial interest so been a steady<br>stream of postdocs and PhD students and<br>create in fact increasing over time and<br>for a Dean that's a little bit anxiety<br>provoked him how to accommodate them all<br>but it's a very good problem to have in<br>a real reflection on the on the actual<br>program itself from the success of that<br>also it really had a very successful<br>collaboration between University of<br>Otago University of came to be<br>undoubtedly the family connection help<br>there but really that was that is very<br>it's really the direction of travel that<br>we like to have and those important<br>relationships where they're out the<br>other partner institutions in<br>Christchurch along with this Anthony<br>stuff about the same time the head of<br>Kieran in that established in the Center<br>for bio engineering and then I medicine<br>and and still has a leadership role in<br>that and for the University of Otago<br>that's its major footprint and<br>bioengineering with a scent of gravity<br>is really around Christchurch in that<br>with with everything you mothers there<br>are a few other distinctions I won't go<br>through them all but them he's also a<br>research professor and Department of<br>physics and astronomy at the University<br>of Canterbury and I know it was the<br>semi-finalists I didn't notice before<br>with your father I think for the New<br>Zealand er of the Year award in 2015 in<br>the area of innovator of the categories<br>so and also just just the last comment<br>I'll make I was thinking around actually<br>that many professors of radiology in New<br>Zealand and we actually had this checked<br>was I think he's the second so I think<br>there's only one other radiologist in<br>the country air professora levels other<br>than them for me so it's not a and I<br>think that's really consistent with the<br>history they derived<br>they haven't been many over time as<br>youth in everything I congratulate you<br>on the promotion and invite you to<br>present your lecture so thank you for<br>coming I'm rather surprised at the size<br>of the audience but that's very<br>gratifying<br>today I'm going to be talking about my<br>Mars research it's a slightly different<br>lecture than I'd normally do in that the<br>introduction section has been replaced<br>by a whole lot of my research history<br>that introduces the basic scientific<br>concepts so I can talk about the Mars<br>program at the end the other thing is<br>people observed outside I've done a few<br>other unusual things for myself<br>one is I've had haircut and the<br>thickened as I put my qualifications on<br>my talk which is something I actually is<br>a person tin not to do I pets fit more<br>the casual role so here's the overview<br>of my talk the first half is I've been<br>calling the journey and I'll explain the<br>various research projects and activities<br>that I've done over the year over the<br>years and I'll with each one I'll bring<br>out one or two scientific points that<br>are critical for the second half of the<br>talk the second half of the talk is<br>about New Zealand's mild spectral CT<br>program this involves about 40 people in<br>Christchurch dozens literally dozens<br>about about 20 or 30 different<br>international collaborators that we<br>published or have agreements with and<br>then the last section of that I will<br>talk about why doctors and patients<br>should care about this research so start<br>with a journey way back at medical<br>school this is the right I went to<br>medical school and I quite enjoyed that<br>but I had an interest in physics so part<br>time added a few extra physics papers<br>and as David alluded to I ended up in<br>radiation oncology I didn't want to have<br>a real job so I did three summer<br>studentships<br>and I had the best job title I think<br>what I learned at that stage because are<br>studying x-rays the x-rays are like<br>visible light they come in different<br>wavelength frequencies color or energy<br>and I'll use those terms interchangeably<br>today I'll try and use the word color<br>but if I slip up and say energy or<br>frequency just think colour now these<br>are all part of the electromagnetic<br>spectrum<br>x-rays do many of the things that lights<br>do it does plus a few others but if<br>you're thinking that about x-rays you<br>have to think they have color these are<br>some of the projects I did as a summer<br>student ship my first publication was on<br>linear accelerators for oncology and we<br>actually had to use two different x-ray<br>colors 6mv and 18 mV so even at my first<br>summer project it was pretty clear to me<br>that color was important I did some<br>computer simulations one summer again<br>the x-ray color comes in and white at<br>one point I did some experiments using a<br>spectroscope that told me the x-ray<br>colors so the take-home point and I hope<br>I've nailed it as x-ray color is<br>important<br>I've in went off did a few years as a<br>junior doctor and ended up in radiology<br>I quite enjoyed imagine this is the way<br>I always picture an imaging system in my<br>head we have an x-ray source which<br>hasn't really changed since this photo<br>was taken they've they now tend to be a<br>beige box rather than a black box but<br>essentially the same we have an object<br>then the hospital we tend to call a<br>patient we have a detector system which<br>in this case is a fluorescent screen so<br>it's probably made of phosphorous the<br>x-rays had it the x-rays glow and the<br>radiologist which I call a pattern<br>recognition system looks at the glowing<br>and says okay I can interpret what's<br>going on inside the body now one of the<br>things it was missed in that whole<br>system is the x-rays came in in the<br>phosphor glowed you have no measurement<br>or idea what x-ray color was involved so<br>it's what I call a black and white or a<br>grayscale system around that time I went<br>to my first international radiology<br>conference and this is our SNA it's they<br>claim it's the world's largest<br>scientific conference fifty thousand and<br>ten days in Chicago they had two rugby<br>fields of new technology and I was doing<br>on call and I was using these things<br>called CT scanners they're the workhorse<br>of radiology our own registrar's on call<br>pretty much do CT all evening<br>these are x-ray systems so we look at<br>one of these a CT works by having an<br>x-ray source which I'd introduced on<br>that first diagram the x-ray beam and a<br>row of detectors now like those original<br>phosphorus screens those detectors in<br>that seat easier work by glowing you<br>haven't hooked them up to a photodiode<br>couple but essentially they glow and so<br>you'll gain missing that x-ray color so<br>these fancy high-end CT scanners are<br>ignoring a whole lot of information<br>that's in the x-ray beam however they do<br>give us 3d pictures so this is a 3d<br>picture of the chest the person's gone<br>through the scanner and we can see this<br>person has some abnormality and the<br>lungs probably a cancer so what did I<br>learn as a radiology registrar 3d x-rays<br>are the best computed tomography you<br>want to have a 3d volume rather than<br>just projection around that time<br>radiology changed in 2005 which was when<br>that picture from iris and I was taken<br>radiology was absolutely booming it was<br>growing at about 4 and 1/2 percent a<br>year hospitals were spending millions<br>and millions of dollars a year on new<br>equipment and then it slowed down what<br>happened well over that period CT went<br>from a single row of detectors fear to<br>multiple rows of detectors so instead of<br>just having a line they had an array up<br>to about 6 or 7 centimeters in thickness<br>now that they fundamentally worked the<br>same way they just glowed but they went<br>much much faster so this is a sort of<br>image she got you've got to get a 3d<br>volume of a whole person in about 2 or 3<br>seconds the limiting factor I'm told<br>these days on a modern CT scanner if<br>they put the patient file through any<br>faster they'd fly off the end you can<br>you know if you think of someone lying<br>on a bit and you accelerate them through<br>a doughnut in two seconds they're moving<br>pretty fast and you have to take into<br>account the acceleration the bead while<br>you do the imaging however we've got<br>pictures that are still fundamentally<br>grayscale going faster not much benefit<br>I can do you in two seconds I can do<br>your heart and and one beat of the heart<br>doesn't help I can image everything down<br>to half a millimeter even a quarter of a<br>millimeter doesn't help with my<br>diagnosis<br>so what actually radiologists really<br>want to know is a molecular stuff the<br>biochemistry stuff so the idea is to<br>work out what the tissue is what is<br>behaviour is a treatment working and<br>that means we need to know the<br>constituents such as fat water calcium<br>and iron we want to look for pathogens<br>and cancer labels so we need<br>physiological markers so radiologists<br>want molecular information go on are the<br>days of radiology being just Anatomy by<br>the time I retire in 25 years radiology<br>will be close to biochemistry<br>now as David alluded to partway through<br>my radiology training I wanted to get<br>back into a bit more research I ended up<br>in an electrical engineering department<br>doing something called computational<br>imaging it was quite fun was kintyre lee<br>computer-based my thesis was entitled<br>IgAN image processing of chest<br>radiographs slightly technical name but<br>basically that's pattern recognition or<br>computer aided diagnosis that falls into<br>the category that sometimes called<br>artificial intelligence it's pretty hard<br>to explain quickly but we were taking a<br>training set and decomposing it using<br>computers and there are a few things<br>that I want you to learn from my PhD<br>firstly images are just a bunch of<br>numbers and in a scientific sense you<br>load them onto the computer they range<br>from minus a thousand to plus ten<br>thousand depending on the image you've<br>got but they're just numbers a chest<br>x-ray might be 10 million numbers 10<br>megapixels in fact most of you might<br>know maths can find patterns and numbers<br>simple and so using computers we can<br>actually find patterns and numbers or<br>patterns and images that the radiologist<br>will never see the human eye is trained<br>to do certain things computers can be<br>trained to do lots of different things<br>so using computers can be quite helpful<br>with images now one of the problems<br>though as some of the patterns we can<br>find can be really abstract and really<br>hard to understand and so we have to<br>work out ways to display and interact<br>with them some of you may have played<br>with our 3d workstation we have outside<br>where we have a what's called fishtank<br>virtual reality that's one of the ways<br>to view them now you end up from a from<br>my PhD this is one of the dive<br>from it and as a city gets abstract but<br>essentially there's a three-dimensional<br>diagram but we were actually looking at<br>a 10 dimensional space looking at<br>possible patterns of variants with a<br>thousand common patterns of variants and<br>one test image so you can see why you're<br>starting to think 10 million dimensions<br>I need a computer however the only thing<br>I want you to remember from this is mass<br>and computers are needed to understand<br>and display x-rays that's the only point<br>that most people need to understand so I<br>finished my radiology I went on a<br>six-week holiday with my family my wife<br>and my one child at the time to Europe<br>and we met my father there for two weeks<br>and traveled around Croatia one of the<br>things my father was a professor of<br>physics so when you go on holiday with<br>him you occasionally talk about physics<br>and he was working at the time he'd he's<br>in the physics department Canterbury he<br>had joined up was soon in the year 2000<br>I hadn't really paid any attention to<br>what he did and he was saying to me you<br>should go and talk to some of these guys<br>here about some of the detectors so at<br>the end of my holiday I went to Geneva<br>this is where soon as it's actually the<br>soil campus here this is your<br>accelerator called the Large Hadron<br>Collider<br>it's a 27 kilometer circumference to<br>accelerator the one I'd used in<br>radiation oncology was about a meter<br>maybe two meter and a half and so 27<br>kilometres was quite impressive they've<br>done a few important things they would<br>claim the most important things that<br>they did is discover the Higgs boson for<br>most people I think the most important<br>thing they've done is a worldwide web so<br>these are some of the detectors dad and<br>I actually still work on soon technology<br>we've so part of the CMS experiment this<br>experiment is one of two experiments<br>that was built to find the Higgs boson<br>this is myself from my father beside the<br>accelerator and this is me beside this<br>CMS it's called the compact muon<br>solenoid it's 12,000 tonnes not 1,200<br>12,000 tonnes it's 15 meters diameter<br>it's 21 and a half meters long and it's<br>100 meters underground by compact what<br>they actually mean is it's so tightly<br>packed<br>and you cannot get your hand into any<br>part of it it's basically a solid bit of<br>electronics and detectors within the<br>middle of that there's some they had a<br>new type of detector they called<br>photon counting detectors so this sits<br>right in the middle there this is the so<br>called silicon barrel<br>they're basically array of microchips<br>stuck in the middle so out of this work<br>I managed to get my most cited paper<br>twelve thousand nearly thirteen thousand<br>citations last time I checked the only<br>problem is it's got four thousand<br>authors so it's almost three almost<br>three and a bit citations people author<br>but it's still great to be part of that<br>collaboration and actually one of the<br>most important parts of that of course<br>is it really does highlight something<br>that's going to become apparent when I<br>talk about Mars or good site were not<br>all words on a lot of good science that<br>has done these days has done part of<br>collaborations most research projects<br>I've had or I've worked on I've actually<br>come by talking to people I don't know<br>many scientists who claim they had an<br>idea on them set by themselves almost<br>every scientist I know would say I had<br>an idea when I was talking to that<br>person or we had an idea talking<br>together and I think that is an<br>important point for people to realize<br>about silence now dad that stage was<br>actually involved in the middie Picts<br>collaboration you sent a master's<br>student off and so on my first visit I<br>actually met the head of the MIDI picks<br>collaboration this is a bunch of<br>universities was trying to turn some of<br>that to take to technology and make it<br>suitable for medicine the collaborations<br>been running for over 20 years since the<br>mid 90s where Canterbury University's<br>been part of MIDI picks three and now<br>MIDI picks for it's got at least twenty<br>five universities MIDI picks three head<br>twenty two and no does that universities<br>you might have heard of such as Oxford<br>Cambridge Berkeley Stanford etc and in<br>fact this is a collaboration meeting I<br>attended an effect Nigel Anderson<br>attended with me in Prague<br>there are over 110 people at that<br>collaboration meeting alone if you know<br>about how scientific conferences work<br>that means a collaboration probably has<br>200 active scientists in it at any one<br>time<br>this was the detector I got most<br>involved with around 2006 2007 I was<br>communicating very frequently with the<br>designers of this detector spending<br>quite a lot of time at soon<br>this is a spectroscope this is a circuit<br>diagram of a spectral x-ray detector<br>it's a hundred and ten micron diameter<br>or edge which means on this but a<br>silicon there's sixteen thousand<br>detectors and you can measure up to<br>eight x-ray colors at once it's actually<br>quite clever in terms of electronics<br>there's four and a half thousand<br>transistors in that detector and half of<br>them are analog and half of them a<br>digital which makes life really complex<br>for the engineers and actually they all<br>communicate with each other so for those<br>of you who are interested in computing<br>this is actually like having sixteen<br>thousand many computers all talking to<br>each other it's quite challenging and<br>you compare that to the original<br>spectroscope as using as a medical<br>student<br>this had a single 30 centimeter 30 30<br>millimeter detector it could do up to<br>128 colors at once so that was quite<br>clever<br>unfortunately required a trolly of<br>electronics beside it and you had to<br>pour liquid nitrogen on it to keep it<br>working so it was a little less<br>practical whereas here you've got a<br>detector in silicon or 16,000 detectors<br>in silicon and that means you could do<br>color imaging so this is a color x-ray<br>that was obtained here in Christchurch<br>Hospital around 2006 or 7 it's 14 by 14<br>millimeters it's a fetal hand and we use<br>for x-ray colors so when I was a medical<br>student something like that was<br>completely impossible you kind of knew<br>the physics said you should be able to<br>it was there but the engineering wasn't<br>in place to actually measure it so my<br>take-home from that as soon made color<br>x-ray imaging possible and I think<br>that's very nice so that's the end of<br>the journey these are the take-home<br>messages I want you to remember into the<br>second half of the talk radiologists<br>want molecular information we want to<br>get more out of the data<br>extract color is important I hopefully<br>have made that point soon has made x-ray<br>color imaging possible so it's now a<br>reality as opposed to something that<br>might happen<br>3d x-rays are best so we want don't want<br>a 2d picture like that fetal hand we<br>want a 3d picture and to do all of this<br>we're going to need to use maths and<br>computers so that now leads me on to<br>talking about the math spectral CT<br>program so the goal of this program is<br>to find out new information about<br>tissues we've now got a new tool a new<br>ruler as someone might say to look at<br>tissues but we don't actually know what<br>what it means we're how to interpret it<br>how to use it but we want to get as much<br>of that out and understand it we also<br>want to have a route to human imaging<br>being a clinician one of the most<br>important things about discoveries like<br>this or programs like this is you<br>actually want to get it into the clinic<br>which means we need to go from working<br>on a lab bench of a physicist into<br>something that's practical for a<br>hospital we've been very lucky and I'll<br>just credit here we've been funded by<br>Ministry of business and its previous<br>incantations to tune of about 20 million<br>we've got a spin-out company from the<br>University of Canterbury and my<br>disclosure Islam and most of the<br>scientists are shareholders and that and<br>that's gone through the process of<br>various fundraising rounds including<br>seeking venture kept successfully<br>seeking venture capital we have a lot of<br>support from the universities which is<br>very pleasing and we've had to support<br>from health organisations such as the<br>National Heart Foundation and the<br>arthritis Society so the team is about<br>40 people in Christchurch it's always<br>very hard to measure a research team the<br>there's some people working full-time<br>and there's actually particularly in the<br>middle school school with a lot of<br>people who are not specifically working<br>on Mars<br>but are using it as a tool for their<br>research we have four universities in<br>New Zealand involved we've got a lot of<br>international partners such as CERN Mayo<br>Clinic we'll talk about them in a moment<br>and other significant universities we<br>also have a partnership agreement with<br>GE healthcare they claim to be the<br>world's largest engineering firm I<br>suspect Harter from India as<br>chasing them as hard as I can and<br>perhaps the most gratifying thing for me<br>I only read this from a document from<br>one of our team we were actually just<br>reached the point of having 30 current<br>or completed PhD students and as someone<br>who's been involved with education<br>that's actually really a career<br>highlight for me at this stage so I see<br>the spectral CT is now possible<br>we called our system Mars it sounds<br>futuristic it's easy to spell it kind of<br>aligns with CT MRI on Peter and reams of<br>short catchy words and it also provides<br>lots of opportunities for puns and jokes<br>and talks and journal articles and<br>things we've called an or resolution<br>system because when we talk about an<br>image we have to talk about the energy<br>resolution or the color of it we have to<br>talk about the spatial resolution ie how<br>big is something or where is something<br>and we have to talk about the temporal<br>resolution so we wind it of a cure<br>you know what phases the heartbeat is<br>that imagine if we compare that back to<br>a standard CT we've only got the<br>grayscale<br>you've only got spatial and temporal<br>resolution this is a physics student<br>with one of the early scanners and I'll<br>talk more about the progression of our<br>scanners just to recap on CT this is a<br>sort of summary diagram I guess at this<br>stage this is the way I tend to think of<br>CT you have an x-ray source putting at a<br>range of colors wavelengths frequencies<br>energies passing through a patient that<br>are attenuated you have a grayscale<br>detector the clothes and from that you<br>calculate the Hounsfield unit in 3d<br>Christchurch Hospital bought a jewel<br>energy scanner a few years ago it works<br>by having two x-ray sources putting out<br>slightly different x-ray energies they<br>are both attenuated in the patient and<br>then you have two sets of grayscale<br>detectors and you get two points on the<br>attenuation curve this is what I would<br>call spectral CT where you have a single<br>source but I got a wide range of colors<br>they're all generated and you have a<br>color detector and then you get multiple<br>points on the attenuation curve so this<br>is like moving from black-and-white film<br>to color film so what is it why is that<br>useful give us some examples this is<br>some work that was done 2009<br>tene I think where we just tried to see<br>well can we see anything different using<br>color that we couldn't otherwise see and<br>so we thought about things like iodine<br>barium gadda lynnium these are used<br>quite frequently in radiology and we<br>realized that we could see them and<br>identify them as individual components<br>we could start to use them in combat and<br>combination it'll open the door for new<br>pharmaceuticals<br>so we took a mouse and we put iodine<br>into its pulmonary circulation we put<br>barium into its lungs and then we have<br>calcium and of course all of these<br>things show up white on a black and<br>white x-ray so that I know is iodine<br>because it's in the circular system<br>somewhere in there as the barium and the<br>linings as a bit hard to tell which is<br>hard to much lungs the bones white and<br>the soft tissues gray and if you do a<br>traditional CT it looks like that you<br>could probably adjust the shading and<br>pick a few more things out this is a<br>color CT of that same animal<br>okay so I've used pseudo color to the<br>various materials because we don't it's<br>hot you have to translate if you like<br>from where they are on the X on the<br>electromagnetic spectrum out at the high<br>energies of x-rays down to something<br>sensible and we tend to assign a color<br>based on the material I'll talk a bit<br>more about that in a moment so here I<br>can see we've got hiding in the<br>pulmonary circulation barium and the<br>lungs I can see the soft tissues as a<br>different color and the bone is a<br>different color and we actually have a<br>tool with what we call a magic lens so<br>you can just pack out of a small region<br>of course if you can take a 2d picture<br>you can make it into a 3d picture you<br>can rotate it round you can you can look<br>through it you can prop the solids of<br>you are familiar with an FM you can<br>probably pick out various lobes you can<br>see the barium kind of scattered through<br>the lungs and although you can see the<br>iodine and the right ventricle and it<br>sort of ended up working back through<br>bits of the lungs as well but to the<br>primary circulation so 3d images using<br>computers<br>so our scanners this is Mars CT one this<br>is my favorite one and that's because I<br>spent many many hours on this it was<br>built by the physics department at<br>Canterbury University and with the<br>electronics done by the electronics<br>department and it worked it was a<br>physics experiment x-ray tube in there<br>if you look on the mechanic see x-ray<br>detectors at the back it was on a hooked<br>up to a computer and it was all command<br>line driven and it was a bit awkward we<br>then made a version two that looked a<br>bit neater we put in a steel box as<br>opposed to lead ply this is this is the<br>one we brought across the medical school<br>at wind of the basement it's you right<br>behind where you guys are sitting same<br>principles and that we have an x-ray<br>tube the middie poke detector at the<br>back and that's actually part of my<br>lunch that's an apple core wrecked and<br>glared rep with a twist tie around us I<br>didn't have a suitable object image and<br>seemed to work v3 we built several of<br>and you can you can see my father again<br>here him and I together we took that to<br>the the Mayo Clinic we've got colleagues<br>here who do cardiac research and this is<br>unpacking it in the basement of the Mayo<br>we built several more they went round to<br>places like Germany and Russia and a<br>couple more to the US these were sold to<br>people who wanted to do CT research<br>people said I want to be the first<br>person in the world to understand what I<br>can do with this sort of technology more<br>recently we've got what we call a<br>commercial system that the two big<br>changes from those earlier systems is<br>that these are human ready so for the<br>last three years we've been putting all<br>of our technical efforts into making the<br>scanner human compatible we've changed<br>our x-ray energies from the low energies<br>that you might use on a mouse to the<br>high energies you might use on a human<br>and we tried to make it easy for<br>biomedical users who you pushing<br>literally it's a green button and the<br>scanner auto configures itself you can<br>put the object down a mouse takes about<br>eight minutes to scan and about an hour<br>later you can sit down on a workstation<br>look at the data CT one that first<br>picture I showed was took an afternoon<br>to get the scanner prepared for the scan<br>might take 24-48 hours to scan your<br>mouse which had to be did of course if<br>you're gonna do that and then a month to<br>get your data back so we were a little<br>bit slow at that stage we've got these<br>one here in the mid school and one of<br>the the labs we've got one an upstate in<br>New York<br>means earlier Polytech and one at Notre<br>Dame and I actually heard last week the<br>one at the Notre Dame took 300 scans in<br>a month so they're using it fairly<br>heavily and I'm looking forward to<br>finding out what they've done this is<br>our visualization tool it's on display<br>out so I don't have a different bit<br>longer afterwards<br>it's called fish tank vr so the object<br>sits in front of you can manipulate it<br>we did this in partnership with a head<br>lay about Canterbury somewhere along the<br>way I've actually spent a few years in<br>the head lab and learned some of that<br>stuff but now we've got a team of five<br>or six people who are in their permanent<br>lis this is a commercial release in the<br>Notre Dame lab so you can see the<br>scanner we sometimes refer to it as a<br>barbecue you can you lift the lid up and<br>you put your sample in and they've got<br>their workstation sitting right beside<br>it here in the mid school we keep that<br>we've actually just had to have two<br>workstations I've really heavily use we<br>keep them on a different floor of than<br>with the scanners so why would people<br>care about this in particular why should<br>patients and doctors care that we can do<br>this we went from grayscale to material<br>imaging so this is a phantom here by<br>phantom I mean it's a perspex block with<br>little tubes<br>sellotaped onto the outside probably<br>containing various materials calcium<br>gadolinium iodine gold water fat okay on<br>a grayscale image they all look roughly<br>the same in effect if I adjust the<br>concentrations of them they will look<br>identical on a color image you can use<br>that extra color to tell which ones<br>which and you can work out the<br>concentration of them so we can see the<br>goal here is at four milligrams per mil<br>eight milligrams per mil 9 milligrams<br>per mil etc so you've got quantitative<br>imaging you get the actual number and<br>material specific imaging<br>so if you do a whole Mouse it can look<br>like that you've this one's had the the<br>water shade of blue the calcium shade of<br>white I'm not sure what colors are what<br>but I can tell this here as kidneys and<br>bladder and bowel and lungs as I said<br>contrast agents put in and of course you<br>can strip even all of the water off and<br>just so certain channels so you can<br>identify them you can do a whole mouse<br>you can do multiple material<br>simultaneously and you get this is a put<br>this in to show that we have uncertainty<br>so it's a standard imaging tool you know<br>this is how accurately I know each thing<br>and this shows the concentrations we can<br>get down to so what clinical projects<br>have we got running at the moment and we<br>have we have spots X projects running at<br>the moment and we also have a few that<br>are sort of starting up each projects<br>have go through its phase of<br>acceleration slowdown acceleration and<br>I'm constantly looking what more can we<br>add to this list we've been doing soft<br>tissue quantification being in New<br>Zealand we started words sheep and when<br>fact we did this work with silver fern<br>farms who want to know this information<br>on there and they're processing<br>factories we took a bit of meat and we<br>scanned it and we separated out the<br>water the leopard and the calcium and<br>they're separate channels and you've got<br>the concentrations so if you render them<br>correctly you can get a 3d picture which<br>looks a little bit like a photo and you<br>can see the marbling in the meat so<br>that's kind of cool<br>some fluent farms were actually<br>delighted at the quality of information<br>we got in the next question was we want<br>to do a whole sheep every three seconds<br>okay we'll get back to you but it shows<br>a potential of the technology you can<br>get this information that can otherwise<br>be very very difficult to obtain so we<br>use exactly the same technique on a<br>carotid artery so this is the artery in<br>someone's neck this particular patient<br>had come in to the hospital with a mini<br>stroke or at EIA and they would have had<br>an ordinary CT to look for a bleed and<br>then they would have had an ultrasound<br>and decided as a a narrowing and the<br>neck and they would have had that taken<br>out and so we've taken it from the<br>operating theatre into the medical<br>school and<br>scanned that we've done dozens of these<br>now I'm not sure 80 perhaps and this is<br>a lipid-rich core we can see the<br>bifurcation and we can see the<br>calcification we can render it in 3d you<br>can see again that the necrotic core so<br>just using the intrinsic tissue<br>characterization you get more<br>information about the object than you<br>would on a grayscale image and so that's<br>really interesting to follow and<br>although we're in this case we've looked<br>at a thorough m'as just about any part<br>of the body has different amounts of fat<br>water and calcium and we haven't looked<br>at them yet we started working with the<br>orthopedic group on osteoarthritis quite<br>a long time ago in fact and this person<br>has had their knee removed for a knee<br>replacement the other had this is that I<br>think must be the lateral half of the<br>knee the medial half of the knee had<br>really bared osteoarthritis that<br>cartilage completely eroded this half<br>the Carthage's of normal thickness but<br>by introducing a contrast agent to the<br>knee and in this case the knee had come<br>out so we did it in a petri dish we can<br>see the biochemical changes of<br>osteoarthritis before you see the<br>morphological changes before you get<br>thinning of the cartilage so that's kind<br>of interesting if you can do it in a<br>petri dish I quite like to do it before<br>I take the knee out and then it starts<br>to enable medical researchers said okay<br>we've got the biochemistry we've now got<br>a test to monitor progression of disease<br>which means developing drugs are going<br>to be much easier instead of having to<br>rely on the patient saying my knees<br>hurting my knee is not hurting we can<br>actually measure the biochemical changes<br>as the osteoarthritis evolves so work to<br>be done but we've got it to the point of<br>proof of concept this is that research<br>at clinical research I think it's going<br>to go on for the next ten or fifteen<br>years in this field alone I said we<br>could get structure and function at the<br>same time this is a from another couple<br>of PhD students they took some human<br>tibias actually sheep to be the a-levels<br>at unhuman and we look at the structure<br>of the bow and we can see little holes<br>and though and what are called<br>trabeculae the Wolves quite nicely we<br>can see them down at a few hundred<br>micron but we also get the calcium<br>density<br>on the same time you're getting bone<br>structure and bone mineralization now<br>when you have a disease like rheumatoid<br>arthritis or osteoarthritis you get<br>different amounts of bone resorption and<br>loss of mineralization so being able to<br>characterize those is kind of useful and<br>in therapy when you give people things<br>like bisphosphonates you may change the<br>mineralization before you change the<br>structure so being able to measure them<br>simultaneously will enable a whole new<br>type of research to be done we started<br>looking at cancer imaging<br>I think cancer imaging is very important<br>does about 35% of New Zealanders died of<br>cancer off the top of my head a lot this<br>mouse we put some gold nano probes in<br>that head we also gave lung cancer we<br>gave it lung cancer on its back and then<br>we injected these probes and these<br>probes targeted the cancer okay<br>takes about 24 hours for the probe to<br>accumulate in the periphery of the tumor<br>but it means we can see where it is and<br>in fact these particular probes just<br>measure vascularity they measure how<br>permeable the blood vessels are which<br>was one of the reasons it's tends to<br>collect in the kidneys and in fact the<br>liver as well we then moved on and<br>started doing specific probes so in this<br>case we've taken Rajee cells from from<br>cancer and we've got gold nanoparticles<br>some of which are attached to a taxi may<br>have been some attached to his septum<br>the Rajee cells only bind to protect<br>some air and when they light up these<br>are actin various calibrations and<br>controls so that's saying the cell<br>pellet here we know there are cells on<br>it because we've used a specific label<br>so think about this in future when<br>someone presents with in this case like<br>it's breast cancer you can start to use<br>radio radiographic contrast agency<br>you've inject which will tell you what<br>cell lines are much part of the tumor<br>and as you treat the tumor you'll be<br>able to see which cell lines are dying<br>off okay we're still at the stage you're<br>doing in the petri dish there's an awful<br>lot of research to go again I'd say<br>decades before this as well understood<br>this is a<br>sort of proof of concept there's going<br>to be dozens and dozens of these<br>nanoprobes made but we're now having an<br>imaging tool that can do it we've just<br>started looking at reducing middle art<br>effects and bone one of the problems<br>with putting a boat metal into bone say<br>in a hip implant is metal has its own<br>x-ray color and so you get a lot of<br>artifact offered the radiologists call<br>it beam hardening what that actually<br>means is the beam has changed its color<br>and become higher energy and if you're<br>measuring the x-ray energy x-ray color<br>you can correct for it and even just<br>narrowing the bends down to make it more<br>specific to one energy gets rid of it so<br>this is a standard CT of a orthopaedic<br>screw in a bone and then you do a Mars<br>image and you can see on the standard CT<br>you get this black appearing here that's<br>been hardening you get artifacts off the<br>metal and by measuring the energy<br>information you get rid of that and you<br>get to see where the metal is and so of<br>course if you highlight it there one of<br>the other projects we've got running is<br>looking at metallic scaffolds so a lot<br>of implants are hip implants and knee<br>implants for example that are done no<br>longer used to mean they use a porous<br>scaffold with a bone grows through into<br>the implant and sort of fuses if you<br>develop in these scaffolds you want to<br>know how fast that bones growing in it<br>will depend on the shot what the<br>scaffolds made out of what surface has<br>got how rough it is the size of the<br>pause but actually be able to measure<br>over time that in growth is kind of<br>helpful so that's why the researchers<br>want to when we can start doing that and<br>a live person and someone presents with<br>a saw hip implant you can potentially do<br>a scan like this and go our it hasn't<br>fused properly I know what's going on<br>so you end up with more information made<br>a video this one many years ago as well<br>so that's the scaffold and you can see<br>that's the bone and the trekkers these<br>are actual been scanned at the same time<br>that's just the bone component and I'll<br>show you they're being scanned at the<br>same time because that's the bone and<br>growth into the scaffold okay so that's<br>what I mean we can separate them out as<br>separate channels but they're actually a<br>single data see it acquired at the same<br>time so that's a cheap boner and as you<br>can tell that had to be removed from the<br>just have to wait for the finish what<br>won't move on we've also looked at gout<br>jewel energy has been used for gap for a<br>while this is this person had their<br>finger amputated because of pain and<br>from the gout and you can see the gap<br>crystals and some erosions when we put<br>it in the Mars scanner we have we get<br>bitter energy information than you do<br>off a jewel energy system because we've<br>got more energy bands and better energy<br>resolution and we have better spatial<br>resolution as well so we can see the<br>micro crystals that you couldn't<br>otherwise see one of the big things<br>that's important of course for the<br>x-rays is x-ray dose how much we're<br>going to mini x-rays we're going to put<br>put into the patient we've been working<br>with Lausanne Hospital on measuring<br>these x-ray dose so this mouse has<br>little things called<br>TL DS and suited all the way through it<br>to me's your x-ray dose we put in some<br>contrast agent to make it a real scan<br>and we scan this and measure the dose<br>and people do it many times of course<br>and we know that the dose of our system<br>is sitting at about the same as any<br>other preclinical scanner so current<br>work and next step and then we time for<br>questions I'm pleased about that we're<br>taking Mars to humans we have to go from<br>imaging a small object like that to<br>imaging a large object like a foot we<br>built up this gantry that's it's not a<br>traditional CT scanner it's an<br>experimental gantry and that we have<br>makes ray tube here and we can put a<br>detector on there it's kind of open so<br>you can replace the detector easily go<br>for bigger arrays you can adjust the<br>magnification by bringing things in and<br>out you can adjust the speed of rotation<br>and the speed you're putting patients<br>through but we're doing human scale this<br>is a sort of<br>that's involved in doing that this is<br>one of our Mars cameras these are the<br>MIDI pix chips they have a semiconductor<br>on there that stops high energy or high<br>or very high very very blue I guess<br>right answer colored stuff<br>these are the infeed and individual<br>circuits for each to tick do we have to<br>have a separate computer and then we<br>have an Ethernet switch so a camera like<br>that is literally hand-built and I did<br>see Brian around somewhere who probably<br>bit areas but who built this one and<br>there's a huge amount of engineering<br>five computers in the camera to control<br>computers and two single board computers<br>so the scanner would have nine computers<br>in it and others boxercise as we move to<br>a human scanner we might end up with 50<br>detector so we've got 50 computers to<br>control all reading data as fast they<br>can so why are we doing this why did the<br>government give us money to do this our<br>goal is to grow that well the<br>government's goal is to grow the New<br>Zealand spectral CT industry did anyone<br>here know that New Zealand had a<br>spectral CT industry well the government<br>now believes we do and so they're<br>funding this research to try and grow<br>the skill base and the technology and<br>the infrastructure for this and we're<br>funded up to our first clinical trial so<br>the first human we put in will be<br>success for that program and our goal is<br>to assist other New Zealand medical<br>technology companies so the scaffold I<br>showed you was I think from a local<br>company called us as we've worked with<br>companies like boutique nanoparticles<br>from Wellington and we work with other<br>groups such as local electronics and<br>mechanical groups so the next step<br>before questions so for the next 12<br>months I'm actually full-time on Mars<br>one of the nice things about working for<br>universities you get research and study<br>leave and mine actually starts today at<br>5 o'clock it's just lack that are<br>happened to coincide with us so I<br>thought a loose date of what I'm<br>planning to do on that the first thing<br>is to finalize the machines for human<br>studies I think we're fairly close I'm<br>going to get more involved<br>and so and you know this is a team of 40<br>people so when I say I am it's the<br>team's doing this we need to keep<br>expanding the lists of biomedical users<br>we haven't even scratched the surface of<br>it this is one of the reasons we've been<br>forming so many international<br>collaborations we need as many people to<br>look at as many applications as possible<br>not everything's beneficial that the<br>problem is what happens is one but looks<br>beneficial for where we go a long way<br>then you get stuck and then three years<br>later accelerates again so the only way<br>to handle a problem like that is to do<br>lots of things in parallel<br>I'd like to re-engage in the technical<br>details of this project as well as I<br>sort of alluded to for that ct1 I used<br>to know the order of ones and zeroes you<br>use to talk to the side of the chip I<br>don't have that level of detail anymore<br>and I'm looking forward to that and I'd<br>like to grow our collaborations both<br>locally and internationally so thank you<br>and that leaves about 10-15 minutes for<br>questions<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
