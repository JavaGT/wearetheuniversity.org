Paul's high<br>school which of course now is kevin a<br>college after a couple of years in<br>christchurch he undertook a Bachelor of<br>theology degree while studying at Holy<br>Cross College before being ordained<br>after several years and Vacarro he<br>headed off to Rome to complete a<br>biblical studies qualification at the<br>Pontifical biblical Institute on<br>completing that training he returned and<br>told a Holy Cross for a time before<br>leaving the priesthood<br>Greg's pathway in terms of his training<br>is extremely impressive it's extremely<br>well trained in addition to his<br>qualification from Rome he also<br>completed his first Otago PhD in<br>biblical studies Greg then worked as a<br>teaching fellow in biblical studies<br>before obtaining a lecturing position<br>and the Religious Studies program here<br>at OU taco at that time of course that<br>was separate from theology but when he<br>found as he puts it that every course he<br>taught was turning into a philosophy<br>course he thought he should get a proper<br>qualification in that field so he<br>completed a second PhD in philosophy and<br>he was very lucky of course to do that<br>Otago was an incredible philosophy<br>department and under the guidance of<br>Professor was going so that's the second<br>PhD this led into course to a joint<br>appointment between the two programs<br>Philosophy in religion although Greeks<br>first book was a straight biblical<br>studies monograph his research since<br>then has focused on the interaction<br>between scientific modes of thought and<br>those characteristic of religion this<br>led to a book on the historical Jesus<br>debates which examined the impact<br>historical thinking on traditional<br>religious claims his philosophy PhD<br>compared to istic explanations those<br>that appealed to divine action with the<br>kinds of explanations offered in the<br>sciences this too was published as<br>theism and explanation<br>last year he published not one book but<br>two one was on the Galileo Affair<br>arguing that religious and scientific<br>communities exhibit very different and<br>often incompatible attitudes to<br>knowledge and the second was on the<br>reshaping of the philosophy of religion<br>so give it a broader focus both in terms<br>of the questions it asks and the<br>religion that covers and it's that kind<br>of broad ambitious program that some of<br>the referees comments refer to until<br>night's lecture Greg is going to give us<br>a taste of his current work on ancient<br>and medieval empiricism so I'm very<br>happy to pass over to Greg who's going<br>well thank you howleen Antoni for the<br>very generous introductions I would like<br>to begin with some more formal words of<br>thanks these are do first of all to<br>Kristin<br>ever since I had that fairly major<br>change of career about 25 years ago one<br>that brought us together<br>she's been unwaveringly as supportive of<br>my work being a medical person she did<br>some years ago diagnosed my condition as<br>an obsessive need to know disorder but<br>happy to say she's made no attempt to<br>cure it my children Anna and Kitty<br>belonged to an exclusive group of<br>philosophers kids living up a Roseland<br>they may regard this as a mixed blessing<br>but what I appreciate is that they've<br>actually become serious conversation<br>partners dinnertime conversations often<br>take a philosophical turn and a recent<br>debate with kitty regarding free will<br>and determinism was as challenging in<br>some ways as a meeting of the philosophy<br>seminar speaking of the philosophy<br>seminar I should also thank the members<br>of the department who welcomed me some<br>years ago when I arrived on the their<br>doorstep as an intellectual refugee<br>since joining the Philosopher's I've<br>often felt like the slow child in the<br>top class but that's not a bad place to<br>be one person to whom I owe a special<br>debt as Ella Musgrave it was 21 years<br>ago when our first visit at the<br>philosophy department then on the fifth<br>floor of the Byrnes building with a<br>draft copy of an article on theology and<br>religious studies I had shamelessly<br>borrowed a number of ideas from the<br>philosophy of science<br>and since I wasn't trained as a<br>philosopher I thought I should check<br>them out so I visited Ellen I came away<br>of course with a polite suggestion that<br>I had bought into some fallacious ideas<br>and a big pile of reading to do the<br>article was eventually published and<br>since then Ellen has been both mentor<br>Ellen as many of you will know studied<br>at the London School of Economics with<br>one of the greatest philosophers of<br>science Karl Popper since Ellen later<br>acted as my PhD supervisor I've always<br>considered myself one of poppers<br>intellectual grandchildren so it seems<br>appropriate that I should today revisit<br>a suggestion made by popper about the<br>birth of philosophy now I need to be<br>really careful talking about the birth<br>of philosophy the philosophy I'm<br>discussing is that which originated in<br>ancient Greece I am NOT suggesting this<br>is the only tradition of philosophy it's<br>not the Greeks were not the only people<br>to reflect on what exists how we should<br>act and how we could know what we think<br>we know Karl Jasper's famously suggested<br>that there was an axial age and human<br>thought between 800 and 200 BC in which<br>philosophical reflection began in a<br>variety of cultures China India Iran<br>Palestine and Greece I'm not convinced<br>that philosophy arose independently of<br>the Greeks in Palestine or a run but it<br>does seem to have arisen in China and<br>India at the same time as it was arising<br>in Greece my colleagues in the religion<br>program will Sweetman and bin Chantal<br>there's been could tell you about any<br>and Buddhist philosophy Ben I'm happy to<br>say as a former student of mine and<br>another former student Sheryl carton<br>there Cheryl is visiting at the moment<br>has gone on to study Confucian<br>philosophy I'm a proud teacher as well<br>as a proud father but about those<br>traditions of philosophy I have nothing<br>to say I do however have something to<br>say about the philosophy of ancient<br>Greece what I want to ask is where this<br>tradition of philosophy came from and<br>how it differed from what went before<br>now there's an answer to this Christian<br>the<br>dates back to Aristotle Aristotle<br>distinguished between the earliest<br>philosophers and those who spoke<br>mythically writing about the gods in its<br>metaphysics we read the school of Hesiod<br>and all the theologians thought only of<br>what was plausible to themselves but<br>into the subtleties of those who spoke<br>mythically it's not worth our while to<br>inquire seriously those however who used<br>the language of proof we must cross<br>examine now those of you who know me<br>won't be surprised that I rather like<br>this contrast between those who tell<br>apparently unfounded stories about the<br>gods and those who used the language of<br>proof it represents a distinction<br>between myth and reason muthos in lagos<br>religious thinkers are inclined to<br>regard a contrast of this kind as modern<br>and to blame it on the so called<br>enlightenment of the 17th and 18th<br>centuries but as much order as we've<br>just seen it's also currently<br>unfashionable classical scholars have<br>pointed out the distinctions of<br>Aristotle's kind were used for polemical<br>purposes they were used by philosophers<br>like Aristotle to stake a claim to<br>novelty in seriousness they were also<br>used by the earliest medical writers who<br>strove to establish their own<br>credentials by disparaging alternative<br>practitioners the battle between<br>scientific and alternative forms of<br>medicine is not new the author known as<br>Hippocrates for example distinguishes<br>his view of medicine from that of the<br>magician's purifiers charlatans and<br>quacks her employ ritual cures the<br>problem here is that the methods of<br>Hippocratic physicians at least<br>overlapped those of many of the ritual<br>healers both for example prescribed<br>abstention from certain foods sometimes<br>the same foods<br>and as we'll see in a moment the<br>earliest philosopher was close<br>philosophy was closer to myth then a<br>casual reader verse of it will be led to<br>believe so the use of this ancient<br>distinction between myth and reason is<br>not unproblematic nor is it innocent it<br>serves purposes other than intellectual<br>now many scholars in the humanities<br>would regard this as a reason to cease<br>using the distinction and to focus<br>instead on the relations of power its<br>use exhibits it's not the relation of<br>myth and reason we should be studying<br>such people would say but the way the<br>terms myth and reason have been used<br>well one can of course take that line<br>but it doesn't follow from the fact that<br>a distinction has been used to defend<br>someone's turf that it's a spurious one<br>this one I want to argue is not there's<br>a real distinction between myth and<br>reason which is reflected in our later<br>distinctions between religion and<br>science theology and philosophy now to<br>understand what lies behind these<br>distinctions a good place to start is<br>with the pre-socratic philosophers<br>thinkers such as Farley's annex amenda<br>and n examinees Parmenides empirically<br>xanex Icarus and Democritus what cool<br>names don't you think great names for<br>ket's<br>actually my children should count<br>themselves lucky I wasn't studying<br>ancient philosophy when they were born<br>they may have ended up being named<br>Xanthippe a and pi theists after the no<br>doubt long-suffering wives of Socrates<br>and Aristotle respectively now I<br>mentioned a suggestion a moment ago made<br>by Karl Popper about the birth of<br>philosophy he too assumed a distinction<br>between myths and philosophy but he<br>argued that philosophy emerged from this<br>and its earliest materials were mythic<br>in form it's that idea I want to pursue<br>popper I think was more correct filling<br>you the earliest philosophy was more<br>deeply rooted in myth than he thought<br>but our Stata was also right to claim<br>that even the earliest forms of<br>philosophy differed from the mythology<br>on which are true so what was the<br>kinship between the earliest philosophy<br>and myths while approach their question<br>by asking three more what were the<br>questions the pre-socratics were<br>addressing what kinds of answers did<br>they give and with what authority did<br>they speak let's start with the<br>Christians<br>the earliest pre-socratics were the<br>Ionians a group of thinkers based in<br>around mellitus on the western coast of<br>Asia Minor modern day Turkey three of<br>these authorities<br>Anaximander and n examinees are<br>traditionally regarded as the founders<br>of science their words there were in the<br>words of a later commentator those who<br>first revealed the investigation of<br>nature to the Greeks but their<br>investigation of nature took a very<br>distinctive form and they did not<br>carefully observe and catalogue the<br>natural world Aristotle would later do<br>that but the pre-socratics did not nor<br>did they carry out experiments<br>experiment was never a prominent feature<br>of brick science although we find<br>related practices and the dissections<br>carried out by medical writers the use<br>of instruments by astronomers and<br>experiments in harmony carried out by<br>those who studied music the<br>pre-socratics however were not careful<br>observers or experimenters there were<br>bold speculators and the questions about<br>which they speculated were firstly what<br>is the fundamental substance out of<br>which all things are made and secondly<br>how did the cosmos the ordered world we<br>can observe come into existence<br>indeed quite a number of them offered<br>more or less detailed cosmo granese as<br>they're called accounts of the origin of<br>the universe now this may seem perfectly<br>reasonable<br>after all modern physics also offers as<br>a theory of the origin of the universe<br>the so-called Big Bang Theory I<br>understand that theory is increasingly<br>contested but it has some evidential<br>support at the time of the pre-socratics<br>however the idea that the world had a<br>beginning was entirely without<br>evidential support there was nothing in<br>the appearance of nature to suggest that<br>the world order was not eternal indeed<br>Parmenides would argue that it was<br>denying that the world could have a<br>beginning for very different reasons<br>Aristotle also claimed that the world<br>had neither beginning nor end a view<br>that seemed plausible for many centuries<br>to come despite this fact a number of<br>the pre-socratics did speak about a<br>cosmogony<br>a beginning of the universe so where did<br>this idea came come from it came I think<br>from the world of myth the poet hesiod<br>had in the 8th or early 7th century BC<br>set out an account of the origins of the<br>world in terms of the birth of the gods<br>a cosmogony which was also a Theogony<br>here it is what the beginnings of it in<br>the beginning there was only chaos theab<br>as' but then Gaia the earth came into<br>being her broad bosom the ever firm<br>foundation of all and Tartarus dim in<br>the underground depths and eros<br>loveliest of the Immortals who makes<br>their bodies and men's bodies go limp<br>the Greeks were strong on eros mastering<br>their minds and some during their wolves<br>now in these opening lines the myth was<br>already partly rationalized the names of<br>the deities are little more than symbols<br>of this worldly realities later in the<br>poem however the gods become more<br>clearly gods indeed gods behaving badly<br>to the great scandal of writers such as<br>Sanaa phonies and Plato here is an image<br>of a God behaving badly Chronos<br>castrating his father Ernest with a<br>sickle in any case the stories found in<br>Hesiod are not the only stories not the<br>only myths to speak of the origins of<br>the world lots of myths speak of origins<br>we have of course our own story of<br>Arachne and papa<br>as well as the opening chapters of<br>Genesis but perhaps the most famous in<br>the ancient world is the Babylonian myth<br>known from its opening words as the a<br>numeral ish when on high the heaven had<br>not been named firm ground below had not<br>been called by name nothing but<br>primordial up zoo their begetter mo mu<br>Tiamat Xu who bore them all their waters<br>commingling as a single body no read Hut<br>had be meted no marshland had appeared<br>when no gods would ever have been<br>brought into being uncalled by name<br>their destinies undetermined then it was<br>the gods were formed within them the<br>earliest philosophers when writing about<br>the beginnings of the world in fact to<br>have the very idea of a beginning of the<br>world<br>were drawing on a collection of mythic<br>themes both from their own traditions<br>and from that of their neighbors these<br>shaped the kinds of Christians they<br>asked they also shaped the kind of<br>answers they gave for often these two<br>came from the world of myths take for<br>example the idea attributed to phallus<br>that the earth forests on water in Egypt<br>the earth was commonly thought of as a<br>flat dish resting on the waters an idea<br>also found in the Hebrew Bible where God<br>has said to have spread out the earth<br>upon the waters in the Babylonian story<br>to upso and Tiamat represent fresh and<br>saltwater respectively and it's they<br>from whom all other beings arise so<br>there seems a fairly direct line from<br>Egyptian and Babylonian myth to the<br>earliest physics morge think still as<br>the cosmogony of an ex amenda in his<br>sayings the substance out of which<br>everything has come into being has<br>become more abstract being the<br>indefinite the world comes into<br>existence by over separating out of<br>contrasting qualities such as the hot<br>and the cold the moist in the dry once<br>separated out these qualities again<br>combined giving rise to individual<br>living things now that story is also<br>mythic in form it follows the same<br>pattern as Hesiod story in which chaos<br>the undifferentiated chaos gives rise to<br>the couple's era boss the god of<br>darkness and night who in turn give<br>birth to a third the bright sky and day<br>the union of earth and heaven in gives<br>rise and turn to other gods here to the<br>primary undifferentiated reality not of<br>which contrasting pairs are separated<br>these contrasting pairs later reunite to<br>give rise to the world we know now<br>mythic ideas are also found on the<br>cosmologies offered by other<br>pre-socratics according to one report<br>here are quite us held that the heavenly<br>bodies consisted of fire in solid bowls<br>the occasional turning of the balls<br>resulting in eclipses and phases of the<br>moon if he didn't say this it reflects<br>the ancient idea that Helios the Sun<br>sails each night in the Golden Bowl from<br>west to east around the northern stream<br>of Okeanos the ocean around the earth<br>the same ideas found in Egyptian myth<br>where the Sun was thought of as<br>traveling from west to east in a boat<br>across the subterranean waters the work<br>of Parmenides consists of a long poem<br>it's cosmology its picture of the<br>universe also resembles they've found in<br>his head<br>beginning with its depiction of the<br>daughters of the Sun emerging from the<br>house of night so not only the questions<br>the pre-socratics asked but also some of<br>the answers they gave were drawn from<br>myth but my third question is with what<br>authority did the pre-socratics speak<br>well there is little of the attitude of<br>the cautious scientist in many of the<br>pre-socratics pronouncements empedocles<br>for instance was not only a philosopher<br>he was also an orator poet politician<br>healer and charismatic seer who in the<br>words of one modern writer France Tehran<br>Sicily performing miraculous cures to<br>adoring crowds at one point he refers to<br>himself as an immortal God will be at an<br>exiled one condemned to a cycle of<br>rebirth because of his misdeeds in<br>previous lives he tells us he had been a<br>boy and a girl a bird and a bush and a<br>dumb fish of the sea now imagine what<br>would happen to any philosopher at a<br>similar remarks may be made about the<br>other pre-socratics part many days<br>begins his poem with the tale of a<br>journey to an otherworldly realm where<br>he meets a goddess who reveals the truth<br>beyond the comprehension of mere mortals<br>empedocles also speaks of a journey to<br>the world of the dead to bring back the<br>soul of one who has died stories of this<br>kind led three of the greatest classical<br>scholars of the 20th century to compare<br>these figures with the shamans shamans<br>if you prefer of siberian tradition<br>indeed one goes so far as to suggest a<br>geographical connection through the<br>Central Asian people the Citians so<br>which is the more accurate picture of an<br>early philosopher the upper image or the<br>lower one the lower image I'm told it's<br>the first depiction of a Siberian shaman<br>by Western writer although it's not<br>clear if we ever saw one sadly most<br>scholars today consider the shaman<br>hypothesis overstated because there's no<br>independent evidence of shamanic<br>practices in Greek society damn it said<br>because an IPL entitled philosophy and<br>shamanism would have been a resistible I<br>would have nicely brought together the<br>two programs in which I work philosophy<br>and religion but even if they're not<br>shamans strictly speaking a number of<br>the pre-socratics seem to have presented<br>themselves as divinely inspired figures<br>if not divine persons in their own right<br>Pythagoras Mempa pythagoras pythagoras<br>for instance best known today for a<br>geometrical theorem he may or may not<br>have discovered appears in the earliest<br>sources as a divine figure a<br>manifestation of apollo and a bringer of<br>a sacred revelation who also taught<br>reincarnation and founded a mystical<br>cult there's even a story of pythagoras<br>faking a journey<br>to the underworld by hiding out in a<br>cellar under his house here it is having<br>arrived in Italy but a little<br>underground room and instructed his<br>mother to write down events as they<br>happened recording the time and to keep<br>passing these notes to him until he came<br>back up his mother did this and after<br>some time pythagoras came up finis a<br>skeleton who went into the assembly and<br>announced he had just returned from<br>Hades what's more he read off to them an<br>account of what happened in his absence<br>taken him by his words they wept and<br>moaned and were sure he was some kind of<br>divinity so they even entrusted their<br>wives to him thinking they too would<br>learn something from him now this is<br>mockery of course and it's mockery from<br>a fairly late writer but there's reason<br>to think it actually reflects early<br>Pythagorean traditions about Pythagoras<br>as mystical powers okay if these were<br>the earliest philosophers what does that<br>tell us it's a no difference between the<br>world of philosophy and that of religion<br>and myth I did after all set out to<br>defend the distinction even if I appear<br>to have just under minded if Lagos did<br>emerge from with oz reason from myth we<br>shouldn't forget how slow and painful<br>was the process by what you came to<br>birth but even in the pre-socratics we<br>find traces of new attitudes which would<br>become characteristic of both philosophy<br>and the sciences the sciences of course<br>just being late offshoots of philosophy<br>a first such feature of pre Socratic<br>thought consistent something we take for<br>granted their ideas are attributed to<br>individuals for all that these<br>individuals may have claimed a quasi<br>divine authority they were individuals<br>named individuals whose views could be<br>accepted or rejected<br>they certainly rejected each other's<br>views nxm anaise for instance<br>so that the earth rests not on water but<br>on air<br>this wasn't just a response to that lays<br>it was a response to his predecessor<br>annex Amanda's idea that the earth rests<br>on what philosophers will call the<br>principle of sufficient reason since<br>there's no reason for the earth to move<br>one way or another an ex Amanda had<br>claimed it remained stationary in the<br>middle of the cosmos and ex M&amp;E seemed<br>to think that was no explanation at all<br>in a similar way<br>Heraclitus as quick to dismiss his<br>predecessors great learning does not<br>teach since for otherwise that would<br>have taught his hidden pythagoras and<br>against Anopheles and hagar taya's it's<br>nasty but as one writer puts it it's<br>unmistakably the sound of an<br>intellectual at work at your great<br>learning does not teach since I<br>sometimes think especially if you left<br>it in the original Greek it might make a<br>good university motto myths by way of<br>contrasts are not thought of in this way<br>myths are not regarded as the creation<br>of individuals with whom you can agree<br>or disagree in societies in which myths<br>are taken seriously they're not up for<br>discussion<br>often they are thought of as not coming<br>from human beings a phrase used by<br>indian thinkers of the vedas some<br>Australian Aboriginal people for<br>instance claimed that their rock art<br>containing images of mythological<br>figures wasn't created by human beings<br>but dates from the time of the Dreaming<br>if myths do have an author that author<br>is divine not human this means that<br>while the myths may be reinterpreted as<br>many Christians today reinterpret<br>Genesis they can't be rejected even the<br>Greeks who became very critical of their<br>myths didn't abandon the stories of the<br>Gods found in hissy and Homer they kept<br>them but rate them as allegories in<br>order to give them a more acceptable<br>meaning<br>in this respect the earliest philosophy<br>did differ from myth it was attributed<br>named individuals and the doctrines they<br>taught were contested from the very<br>beginning excuse me no I'm tempted to<br>say that a second feature of<br>pre-socratic thought is a search for<br>natural explanations of observable<br>phenomena but that would be too quick<br>what we find emerging in the<br>pre-socratics is the very idea of nature<br>the very idea of a natural world capable<br>of being distinguished from that of the<br>gods this isn't a scientific discovery<br>it's an idea without which there would<br>be no science the pre-socratic seemed to<br>have been among the first to think of<br>the world as a cosmos an ordered system<br>of causes and principles that could be<br>thought to operate on its own terms it's<br>only in the light of that idea that the<br>phrase natural explanation has any<br>meaning given that distinction however<br>we can say that the pre-socratics began<br>offering natural explanations Saleh's<br>for instance explained earthquakes as a<br>result of the movement of the water on<br>which the earth wrists<br>he no longer tributes them to the action<br>of the god Poseidon what this means is<br>for the patterns of explanation employed<br>by the pre-socratics may be derived from<br>myth the elements of their explanations<br>are not it may not be very helpful to<br>invoke the hot and the cold the moist<br>and the dry as the basic elements of the<br>world but these are natural properties<br>whose operations can be verified by<br>means of observation there's much<br>discussion today regarding the<br>naturalism of the sciences the fact they<br>don't don't invoke God or the gods well<br>this doesn't by the way mean that<br>divinity was banished from the world<br>Democritus may have been an outright<br>materialist and atheist but most of the<br>pre-socratics were not they still made<br>reference to some divine reality or<br>principle saleh's and state is supposed<br>to have said that all things are full of<br>gods but the pre-socratics new<br>conception of the world went hand in<br>hand with the new conception of the<br>divine not only were a particular<br>phenomena not explained by referring to<br>the actions of the gods but the gods<br>themselves were no longer depicted as<br>personal agents who intervened and<br>earthly affairs that most explicit and<br>the work of Xenophon 'yes but the other<br>pre-socratics too if they did speak of<br>the divine tended to present it as<br>simply the ruling principle of an<br>orderly universe a final new feature of<br>the pre-socratics thought is that not<br>all their pronouncements took the form<br>of dogmatic assertions or alleged to<br>divine revelations they also began to<br>engage in reasoned argument here are<br>cleitus while speaking with the<br>authority of a divinely inspired seer<br>still cause on us here is to pay<br>attention not to him but to the logos<br>the underlying structure or plan of the<br>world<br>Anaximander didn't just assert that the<br>earth was suspended in the midst of the<br>cosmos but produced an argument for this<br>view Parmenides didn't just appeal to<br>the authority of his goddess but used<br>arguments albeit condensed and enigmatic<br>Parmenides did speak of a revelation<br>from a goddess but it was a goddess who<br>told him to judge by means of reason the<br>much contested proof she was offering<br>gods a contrast here between reason and<br>sense perception but the call to judge<br>by me<br>the reason is a self significant the<br>gods of traditional religions do not<br>invite you to judge for yourself if<br>their words are true in the formulation<br>of such arguments the mythic forms of<br>thought on which the briefs are critics<br>drew were gradually becoming something<br>else to borrow a phrase from Francis<br>Cornford they were becoming not just a<br>search for wisdom but a search for<br>wisdom they could give an account of<br>itself under critical examination a<br>search for wisdom that could give an<br>account of itself under critical<br>examination that's not a bad description<br>of what philosophy aspires to be yes<br>philosophy has its roots in myth and in<br>its earliest forms and practitioners<br>were shaped by myth but philosophy<br>eventually emerged from the myths muthos<br>did become Lagos myth to become reason I<br>might have this parallels my own<br>progression from theology to philosophy<br>but that's the story for another day<br>thank you<br>so thank you very much great I think<br>Greg's lecture has introduced us to some<br>of his current ideas and now a set of<br>arguments that have drawn upon his very<br>distinctive intellectual trajectory<br>through two different disciplines he<br>suggested that there is an ancient<br>distinction between myth and reason<br>between metals and logos which has<br>recently fallen into disfavor and his<br>talk tonight he has defended this<br>distinction by suggesting that was out<br>of the world of myth that philosophy<br>emerged he has argued that the<br>pre-socratics the earliest philosophers<br>in the Greek tradition were heavily<br>dependent upon both myth and religion<br>for the questions they asked the answers<br>they gained and the manner in which they<br>spoke but he has also insisted that<br>their sayings bear witness to an<br>important set of transitions firstly<br>they regarded each other's ideas as up<br>for debate beginning a tradition of<br>critical discussion secondly they began<br>to offer natural rather than theological<br>explanations refusing to attribute<br>observable events to the actions of gods<br>finally they did not just present their<br>own views but began to argue for them<br>these three characteristics Greek has<br>argued marked the emergence of<br>philosophy from the world of myth and<br>religion<br>Greg's lecture has taken us to another<br>time and place showing us how<br>influential traditions of understanding<br>an argument took shape and changed and<br>doing so he has reminded all of us of<br>the capacity of humanities scholarship<br>to illuminate vital questions about<br>human society about how human<br>communities think and communicate how<br>they make sense of the world and what it<br>is to be human so thank you all for<br>coming and enjoying in the celebration<br>of Greeks promotion he's demonstrated<br>tonight I think very clearly the<br>qualities that have seen him promoted<br>I'd like to invite you to join the<br>academic party for refreshments in the<br>staff club but before doing so can we<br>join together to conclude<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
