to ask those and I'm<br>just wondering maybe we could introduce<br>ourselves I can see who's here and what<br>your interests might be as if that's<br>okay fella for I know that you might<br>like to introduce juice juice yourself<br>anyway<br>it's<br>great okay well thank you that it's<br>really great to know who's here and I<br>can see there's a range of interests and<br>hopefully it will cover those and as a<br>so very happy to take questions so as as<br>noted in the introduction Wellington and<br>in the advertising for this wellington<br>city councillor has recently launched a<br>voluntary oriental wife scheme and I'm<br>going to be taking you through our our<br>current study and and how we got there<br>now how does this click a week just like<br>that oh yeah that works okay so it's an<br>exciting time for the for the University<br>of Otago rental Warren Fitness we've<br>been working and nudging and meeting for<br>years together out into the world and<br>after all that work it was finally<br>launched in Wellington in the last two<br>weeks and after the flurry of activity<br>around that it's a great thing to be<br>able to take the time today to look at<br>how we got here and where we going next<br>so I'd say that the rental weren't<br>Fitness sits at the intersection of of<br>housing and health and that it's a tool<br>for prioritizing physical improvements<br>to housing with priorities seat so as to<br>improve health outcomes I'm going to<br>take you through both the evidence and<br>the policy environment that lead to the<br>wife's development then describe the<br>current warrant Fitness study and the<br>next steps for for us for improving New<br>Zealand's rental housing standards first<br>I'd like to take you back in time to the<br>early 2000s I wasn't in public health<br>bin but housing conditions were barely<br>on the radar either for the public or in<br>policy suddenly they were for some<br>researchers there was some recognition<br>and government of the need to do<br>something about poor housing for Maori<br>and Pacific people but no brude<br>awareness of the overall inadequacy of<br>New Zealand housing leaky homes were<br>still being built we didn't know it the<br>perception of renting was that it was a<br>temporary arrangement come and sit down<br>a stopping point between leaving home<br>and buying your own home in 1991 only<br>just<br>over a quarter of the population we're<br>renting and we haven't really registered<br>or noticed that this had crept up to<br>nearly at third and 2001 and we're<br>probably still thought that that<br>increase was only going to be temporary<br>sorry I need to figure out how to go<br>down sorry technical challenges like<br>here we go okay I'm good right we knew<br>there was some poor housing but as a<br>nation we thought it only affected a<br>small group of people mostly tertiary<br>students for a short period of time this<br>wasn't really the case like now about<br>two-thirds of ranching households were<br>family units but it was the general<br>perception brands had started measuring<br>housing conditions but their surveys<br>only included owner occupied properties<br>and the state of rental housing was<br>largely unleashed with renting seen as<br>something temporary and awareness of<br>housing quality issues low there was<br>little focus on housing standards and<br>existing housing or tenants rights to<br>decent homes the 1947 housing<br>improvement regulations were practically<br>forgotten and not really considered for<br>enforcement I can remember early<br>discussions around can these even still<br>be enforced the main piece of<br>legislation on rental house in the<br>Residential Tenancies Act required only<br>that properties be in the reasonable<br>state of repair taking into account the<br>age of the property housing was not<br>generally framed as as a health<br>environment and New Zealand evidence for<br>the role of housing and health was still<br>quite limited but that was about to<br>change I've committed a PowerPoint faux<br>pas here and I put too much information<br>on one slide but I wanted to list just a<br>small section of the contribution of the<br>University of Otago to the research<br>environment for evidence for housing and<br>health so we've had 20 years of of New<br>Zealand research showing them multiple<br>associations between housing and health<br>we now can show that mold and the home<br>is associated with the development of a<br>small very close to that insulating<br>homes improves well-being and reduces<br>school absences replacing our flue gas<br>heaters with energy-efficient pitas<br>reduces asthma symptoms and events we've<br>done cost-benefit studies showing the<br>insulation has a benefit to cost ratio<br>of four to one and one study or six to<br>one and another that the warm up New<br>Zealand heat smart subsidy was a direct<br>result of the it's like to think of<br>direct result of the insulation cost<br>benefit research showing that if you<br>spend money on insulating houses you<br>have just been lease on on on health<br>costs then there's also the issue of<br>home injuries of which there are about<br>over a million each year requiring<br>medical treatment and Michael keels<br>research has shown that spending just<br>eight hundred dollars on home<br>modifications to fix safety hazards<br>reduces injury by twenty six percent<br>with a benefit to cost ratio of up to<br>thirty seven to one which was huge<br>so at the same time as we have been<br>working on developing our understanding<br>of the range of Health fits and costs<br>associated with poor housing we've seen<br>a contributor to the growing recognition<br>of the problems with New Zealand's<br>housing stock the reality is that the<br>condition of the majority of our housing<br>is poor you're still estimated to be<br>eight hundred thousand homes with<br>inadequate insulation and with brand<br>surveys now starting to measure the<br>difference between rental housing and<br>owner occupier housing is also better<br>evidence for the reality that rental<br>properties are in worse condition than<br>our occupied homes and this shouldn't be<br>too surprising we have that split<br>incentives and home maintenance tenant<br>benefits for the land would be as a cost<br>property prices rising faster than<br>inflation means landlords have not<br>needed to maintain their homes in order<br>to maintain their property values at the<br>same time the increase in shortage in<br>housing<br>my relative demand and the lack of<br>housing standard regulation or<br>enforcement has they meant landlords<br>haven't needed to maintain their homes<br>in order to continue to maintain rental<br>income either Kasich phil smith found in<br>a 2008 study that landlords said they<br>were unlikely to insulate their<br>properties even if the cost of<br>insulation was subsidized and that's<br>been borne out in our subsequent<br>experience as well<br>the warm up new zealand evaluation also<br>found landlords were underrepresented<br>among those who took out the subsidy<br>despite their properties being at least<br>likely to be insulated in the first<br>place<br>so the current legal framework means<br>that tenants can't fix their properties<br>without landlord permission but we know<br>from landlord surveys that landlords<br>defer maintenance and improvement to<br>their properties i mean while the number<br>of people reading has continued to grow<br>there is a growing recognition that<br>renting is not a temporary arrangement<br>and that the renting population is more<br>than just students that like they're<br>both multi person households and how<br>those house dates define them though<br>that include those those flats they make<br>up only nine percent of the rental<br>market at the same time that the number<br>of people living in rental rentals has<br>been rising those most vulnerable to ill<br>health particularly children and poverty<br>and others it's the less advantageous<br>end of the social determinants of health<br>are far more likely to be reached and<br>mental tenure than to own their own<br>homes so I'm just going to take a pause<br>here so I'm often asked why there aren't<br>Fitness focuses on regional housing and<br>this is why is certainly true that the<br>average condition of all you see on<br>housing is old and cold and poorly<br>maintained that rental housing is older<br>and colder and more poorly maintained<br>and tenants can't fix problems with the<br>homes without the landlord's permission<br>meanwhile we have high rates and<br>illnesses potentially linked to poor<br>housing we have high infectious disease<br>rates large part what's your respiratory<br>diseases asthma rates are amongst<br>highest in the world and like most<br>temperate countries we have a large<br>difference between winter and summer<br>mortality and hospitalization rates as<br>The Herald article kindly pointed out on<br>Wednesday 30 thousand children are<br>hospitalized each year from preventable<br>diseases associated with housing<br>conditions and 20 children die<br>we know from numerous studies both here<br>and overseas that improving the physical<br>structure of housing improves health<br>outcomes so we know what the problems<br>are we have shown that repeatedly over<br>time and the rental housing warrant of<br>fitness is the culmination of a result<br>of concurrent work done on a potential<br>way to reduce those problems so at the<br>same time as we were developing that<br>evidence for what the relationship was<br>between housing and health we are also<br>looking at what what can we do about<br>this so our proposed fixed for summer<br>net problem is a set of mandatory<br>standards for rental housing<br>independently inspected and verified so<br>landlords and tenants both know a rental<br>property meets the basic minimum<br>requirements to allow a tenant to keep<br>themselves safe warm and dry and their<br>home and over time this has become known<br>as the rental world fitness it wasn't<br>necessarily our first choice for what to<br>call it just kind of ended up that way I<br>think it was nice and short for for<br>editors to put on the headlines Ritu<br>what kind of fence where as mandatory<br>standards for housing doesn't so much so<br>back in the early days of taking our<br>Langer we needed a tool to identify what<br>was right and wrong with housing we<br>spent a lot of time going through the<br>evidence and working with brands and<br>other housing researchers to develop the<br>healthy housing index I've got here an<br>illustration of pages 40 and 41 from the<br>healthy housing index inspection booklet<br>these are pretty near the end but I<br>think they show just how detailed the<br>indexes that takes a good half day to go<br>a hundred and something questions the<br>half-day inspection time wasn't even<br>going to be practical for anyone as a<br>nationwide rental housing intervention<br>there are about 450,000 regional house<br>houses in New Zealand even in a smaller<br>city like to need and which has got<br>about 13,000 rentals that it would take<br>25 years of working hours to inspect<br>them all taking half a day so the<br>healthy housing index project had begun<br>when we were approached by brands<br>suggesting it and we originally used it<br>to identify health issues as in the<br>housing and our studies but we also saw<br>its potential contribution to developing<br>some housing safety standard and it has<br>to announce be an excellent research<br>tool which was what it was developed for<br>but it is too big and too long to to be<br>practical so we worked with the New<br>Zealand Green Building Council who were<br>also looking at something similar and we<br>thought it was better to work together<br>to convince the healthy housing and it's<br>down to a 31 point checklist and there's<br>good evidence showing that but it's<br>better to kind of to focus on on the the<br>main interventions that you need rather<br>than trying to measure everything we<br>took those 31 points to a pretest and<br>that lead to a few tweaks which brought<br>the checklist down to 29 items which<br>cover insulation the insulation heating<br>safety hazards basic immunities and the<br>basic standard of repair the pretest<br>showed that it could be practical that<br>you could do it in just under an hour<br>and in most homes and that it would be<br>workable across a broad range of New<br>Zealand housing types so whether it's a<br>small apartment or a big old rambling<br>fellow or some 1930s streamline things<br>only 4% with properties past the pretest<br>but<br>the properties that were volunteers for<br>us the landlord came into that as a<br>volunteer so the property was taken<br>errors they weren't thinking all we've<br>got to pass this I bet affects that<br>little thing first of all the people<br>come through so over half the properties<br>could pass with with minor repairs to<br>things like putting safety stays on or<br>making sure the smoke alarms are on the<br>right place so on but also because they<br>were volunteers they were also perhaps<br>more willing more engaged landlords so<br>the survey finding it mentioned earlier<br>that landlords going to improve their<br>properties even with subsidies may said<br>if the landlord's who participated in<br>the Preeti's were not necessarily<br>representative of New Zealand landlords<br>overall so effect that four percent pass<br>rate might have been higher in the<br>so the next stage we because we work<br>with those five councils we approach<br>with some of them see to us okay great<br>what's the next step and we look to it<br>we applied for funding from the Health<br>sort Health Research Council to do a<br>study of the effects of introducing it<br>and we got funding to do that and<br>decided to work with Wellington under<br>need and City Council's because they<br>were both willing and also of a size<br>that was going to be practical for a<br>study and with appropriate control<br>cities nearby so for Wellington we have<br>Lower Hutt in for Dunedin we have in the<br>Cargill the current study involves<br>working with Wellington in Dunedin<br>towards the introduction of the rent<br>Warren Fitness and the council areas and<br>Wellington it's been first introduced as<br>a voluntary scheme we really wanted to<br>leap straight to mandatory but starting<br>voluntary has turned out to be a good<br>thing because it's meant we could work<br>through a range of the implementation<br>challenges without the pressures of a<br>mandatory regime and there is also the<br>sticky point of how<br>make it mandatory we had originally<br>thought well have a local members bill<br>but that wasn't going to fly because<br>poor quality housing as a nationwide<br>issue so you can't just order and one<br>address it in one area and so then we<br>thought well maybe we can Joe a bylaw<br>and Wellington Lauren and Dunedin and<br>then we had to accept eventually that<br>that was not going to work either<br>because the Local Government Act<br>prevents councils from going beyond the<br>building code and what they require of<br>their citizens so and there was an<br>additional problem with that I'm sorry<br>we've been locked a ton forcing the<br>world of fitness as a seat of in a way a<br>just a policy your way that we would<br>enforce that counts as we're enforcing<br>the housing improvement regulations and<br>and other legislation but we have set<br>that aside as well because there was an<br>enforcement problem the council doesn't<br>have the right to go into people's homes<br>and this has been a complaint so we<br>couldn't require landlords to have and<br>then speak to come through we have come<br>up with a further approach which<br>involves differential rates but that<br>approach hasn't been fully discussed<br>with the participation councils so I<br>don't want to preempt anything here but<br>we're hopeful this is just a quick list<br>of the 29 points you don't have to read<br>it all but the main point here is that<br>you can see that they're good basic<br>here's no questions there is of course a<br>whole bunch of criteria under each of<br>those so that if you're going through<br>and you say oh do the do I do I really<br>need I can't give them to my ceiling to<br>put on the ceiling installation and<br>we're saying no that's fine then the<br>so for the study itself we've we've<br>built the warrant Fitness on health<br>evidence but this study is the next step<br>than the evidence collection to ensure<br>that the proposed intervention<br>and fitness has the desired outcomes<br>without introducing adverse outcomes<br>will the Warren Fitness improve health<br>and injury rates and reduce unwanted<br>mobility so people move in more often<br>than they want to without leading to<br>higher rents or without reducing rental<br>availability or without increasing<br>homelessness there are other social or<br>economic effects which are not directly<br>related to health or rental tenure which<br>are affected we also want to check that<br>it's a practical policy and featuring on<br>a larger scale and that it can be<br>introduced in a way that cost mutual to<br>councils while also doable for landlords<br>are they able to comply with the<br>mandatory timeframes and so on the<br>outcomes we're aiming to measure are<br>from health data we have prescriptions<br>hospitalizations mortality home injuries<br>we're also getting economic data from<br>trade me from the Bureau has agreed to<br>ensure them to share their insurance<br>claim data with us we'll be looking at<br>the Eco insulation subsidy uptake or we<br>had hopes to but a cancellation subsidy<br>ends fairly shortly so there won't be so<br>much of that dirt to work with and we're<br>also looking at social outcomes student<br>tune over and low decile schools with<br>the people who leave social housing to<br>go into the private sector at least<br>likely to end up coming back applying<br>for social housing again we will need to<br>collect qualitative data on homelessness<br>because it's it's difficult to remember<br>that using administrative data at a city<br>level and but but we do have access to<br>tena mobility through the integrated<br>data infrastructure so we can lock a<br>tenancy bond data and how long those<br>those tendencies are last thing and they<br>will also be interviews with landlords<br>and tenants for the economists doorto in<br>the audience I think this we have the<br>effect measurement and we have a proper<br>formula so for each of those outcomes we<br>look at the difference between the<br>treatment and the control cities so<br>Wellington Doha<br>to need and mcCargo before and after the<br>intervention controlling for demographic<br>differences between treatment and<br>control cities but so the study itself<br>as well then we've got the outcomes and<br>and so on and the the intervention but<br>there's a second question which we were<br>also looking at when we do the study and<br>that's how to ensure we address the<br>policy barriers that currently prevent<br>nationwide introduction of a mandatory<br>warrant of fitness scheme the strategic<br>value of the warrant Fitness study is<br>that its implementation requires<br>community and political engagement we<br>have consulted as far as possible with<br>every government department who might<br>have an interest in factors related to<br>housing the rental market and<br>residential rental business as well as<br>with community organizations church<br>organizations and other NGOs and likely<br>business and service providers not just<br>the initiation industry but also<br>hardware businesses in the insurance<br>industry to make sure that we are asking<br>consultation has been hugely valuable<br>it's identified outcomes that we didn't<br>consider measuring but which help tell<br>the whole story about the the wolf so<br>because we went to ACC they say yes you<br>can look at ACC claims the the idea to<br>measure social housing rebound came from<br>consultation with MSD and and the same<br>pink bats of seed yes we can we can see<br>whether sales of insulation materials<br>change in those areas so their site<br>those outcomes are a bit more removed<br>from what we would learn airily think of<br>we're looking at health outcomes from<br>housing but we want to be as confident<br>as we can be that when the study is<br>complete if anyone asks but have you<br>looked at this thing which is why I<br>objected to the Reg one of two of the<br>idea of mandatory or offenders that we<br>can say yes we have<br>what we found or alternately I say or<br>where you can say well we consulted with<br>you at the beginning and you didn't<br>raise this is a problem so you can't<br>complain afterwards I'm sure they will<br>anyway so there have been<br>implementations challenges at the every<br>level along the way there have been<br>political barriers from the from the<br>central government from the from local<br>government we have both NGO opponents<br>and allies there have been there's been<br>the the legal challenge of how we get<br>how we find a way to do it and and so<br>we've ended up with a voluntary scheme<br>at least for now and Wellington there<br>have been issues of staff turnover and<br>councils and so on and then the<br>practical questions of who does the<br>inspections who will train the<br>inspectors how to landlords book<br>inspections how to councils know when<br>the tenancy turns over a minute and the<br>last flurry of activity that kind of the<br>last few weeks the development of this<br>app so that people can do their own pre<br>inspections and also so that the<br>Assessors have it available to use for<br>the inspections themselves and it's been<br>very interesting for me as a public<br>health researcher because these things<br>are quite removed from what we think of<br>as as as public health issue what I<br>thought of you I was an epidemiologist<br>looking at the difference between winter<br>and normal into health outcomes and<br>that's very much kind of here are the<br>numbers and here is the output and it's<br>in a publication and this is much<br>broader and so taking evidence and<br>policy involves a much broader<br>engagement with with a range of sectors<br>than what we perhaps traditionally think<br>of and health so we have there has been<br>that need to engage with the public I<br>think we have brought them on our<br>journey from that point in the 2000s<br>from when they weren't really thinking<br>about their yeah<br>housing quality particularly<br>installation was not really something<br>that you thought about when you were<br>looking at a rental or looking at a<br>house to buy and we could have done that<br>research and<br>settlement and we'll just going to put<br>out the papers and and it would Sofia<br>but part of the I think the role and<br>public health and certainly which<br>Philippa has has lead has been taking<br>that to the public and making people<br>aware because you can't cannot get that<br>policy change without the evidence but<br>also without the advocacy so the rental<br>one fitness was developed over different<br>stages over 15 years based on evidence<br>of the greatest impact for the fourth or<br>the least intervention or release time<br>involved it was very much intended to be<br>the whole healthy housing program was a<br>way of how can we address inequalities<br>and housing is one aspect of<br>inequalities but the study itself is<br>designed to test whether a lot can be<br>implemented with the desired outcomes<br>without adverse consequences and it also<br>aims to address those outstanding policy<br>questions about mandatory standards for<br>rental housing but that but I still come<br>back to the main thing with the wintry<br>torrent furnace is that it is<br>evidence-based we have created that<br>evidence we have socialized the results<br>I think is the under management speak<br>for it and then developed a tool that<br>incorporates that evidence and then<br>taken it into the public arena so that's<br>where we are now and I think I'll take<br>questions</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
