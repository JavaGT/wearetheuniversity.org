Do we bring in consultants and they do innovation for our company? Do we make everyone innovator in our company? Or do we engage some start-ups and hope that their vibes will spread through our organisation and thatâ€™s our solution to innovation?   <br>In this video, we have a panel of speakers from four leading organisations across New Zealand, sharing innovative initiatives that they implemented in their organisations.

am so incredulous that so many<br>people have turned up for such an early<br>start on a Friday morning and I can see<br>some familiar faces in the audience and<br>it's absolutely lovely to welcome you<br>back for those of you who don't know me<br>I'm Wendy Kerr and I have the absolute<br>pleasure and privilege to be the<br>director for the center of innovation<br>and entrepreneurship at the Auckland<br>Business School which is obviously part<br>of Auckland University our mission at<br>the Centre for innovation and<br>entrepreneurship is to unleash the<br>spirit of innovation and<br>entrepreneurship across all staff and<br>students at Auckland University and we<br>do this because we want to transform<br>their mindsets so that together that<br>they can build a more prosperous and<br>creative New Zealand economy we have had<br>an outstanding feedback and an<br>astounding result today to get so many<br>people in the room and clearly the topic<br>is heading a chord with all of you and I<br>know that we've gone to many conferences<br>and panels and discussions about<br>disruption uber this Airbnb this and I<br>think some of us are a bit tired of the<br>same old rhetoric around what innovation<br>and disruption is so today I hope that<br>you are enlightened by a gritty panel<br>discussion from people who have been<br>there and done it so I'd love to know so<br>I can't how many of you are working in<br>corporates who are struggling of<br>innovation and how many of you are<br>working in firms that want to help<br>corporates about innovation there it's<br>more like it so we've got a good blend<br>of people who need helping people who<br>want to help if we're thinking about<br>innovation how do we do it<br>do we bring in some consultants and they<br>do innovation for our company do we make<br>everyone an innovator in the company or<br>do we buy some groovy startup and just<br>hope that their vibe spreads through<br>their organization and that's our<br>innovation solution so today we have<br>four panelists who have been experts in<br>the field of innovation and made some<br>significant changes in all of their<br>organisations and you're going to hear<br>from them today<br>about how they've<br>and what they've learned from it so<br>every panelists will speak for five<br>minutes and then after they've spoken<br>we'll open up the floor for questions so<br>first of all we have Li angers and she's<br>a head of innovation and<br>commercialization at ASB bank she has a<br>stellar career of really innovating<br>globally she's worked with large<br>corporates with research labs<br>universities and commercial agent<br>commercialization units in Israel China<br>Australia and now we're lucky enough to<br>have her in New Zealand so we've all<br>seen the innovation that ASB has done<br>and he's going to share with us her<br>experiences there and around the world<br>thank you good morning everyone so can<br>you give me your own I'm a little cranky<br>and the voice you'll have to excuse me I<br>can be back and forth between Australia<br>and New Zealand so every time I get<br>around playing I said to bring the<br>Australian kind of strain over here and<br>then the other one will have to excuse<br>me<br>so I yeah I kind of I guess it's a<br>rather strange and wonderful last 15-20<br>years in innovation and have done it in<br>all sorts of environments<br>Wendy's alluded to alignment in terms of<br>research environments as well as<br>corporates but I also bear the bruises<br>of having startups of my own and and<br>have one at the moment that's been<br>ongoing for about three years now and<br>it's reasonably successful but it's<br>taken me about the fifth one to get<br>there so I I have a rather empathetic<br>heart for startups and entrepreneurs and<br>founders trying to get businesses off<br>the ground because essentially it's hard<br>hard work so in terms of corporate<br>innovation I'm on my I guess my third<br>gig of corporate innovation I did tech<br>transfer for a university for about four<br>years which was in licensing research<br>and a new intellectual property and<br>emerging technologies into large<br>corporate environments and then on the<br>other side I did a period of time with<br>Domino's in Australia which is the ASX<br>listed company that has multiple<br>territories across the world<br>I did seven months there in what is the<br>quick service industry and it was brutal<br>in the sense of just how fast they<br>operate how quick they need to go to<br>market and also I guess just as a<br>culture it's a really challenging<br>industry and then more recent times now<br>almost a year in with ASB in making<br>finance which is a completely different<br>the sector again so it's it's been<br>really interesting journey and I guess<br>I'll just talk to a few of the<br>differences perhaps around what I've<br>seen from say a Domino's environment to<br>an ASP environment and some of the<br>things that we've done really well to<br>have some things where we've kind of<br>tripped up and and need to learn from<br>that so Domino's is an intriguing<br>company in the sense that it is a five<br>billion company the share price drops<br>recently so I suspect it's down to about<br>for now but a five million company that<br>is still run by one of the original<br>founders of the Australian territories<br>so Domino's is a US brand and then it's<br>licensed now as a franchisee but the<br>original Domino's person in Australia<br>Don may who's probably I think he's<br>sitting around 45 years of age was<br>originally a driver Pizza driver you<br>know flipping the pies<br>getting them out the door so comes from<br>grassroots and he's built that business<br>up from in the Australian territory to<br>New Zealand Japan Belgium Netherlands<br>France Germany and the Principality of<br>Monaco which is quite intriguing you<br>know I'm just not quite sure what their<br>pizzas look like they're a bit God<br>crusted so he's gone from one store<br>working as a pizza delivery guy one<br>store to now what is 1700 stores and<br>inherently operates like a founder of a<br>start-up you know gets a flash of an<br>idea from an instinctual only stomach<br>you know in the gut going to do this and<br>runs hard and fast for the opportunity<br>and the whole business runs within we're<br>really really quickly and they pride<br>themselves on everything first time<br>everything first a Pizza Tracker first<br>two autonomous room<br>first - you know drone deliveries first<br>to everything so they they really really<br>run fast it's a hot paced environment it<br>was a great experience in the sense that<br>John when he wants the business to move<br>the business moves and moves really<br>really fast so if he wants something<br>done and it ignites his interest and his<br>passion it gets done immediately I mean<br>and you know I think that's half of the<br>success of the business is the sense<br>that you do have this really<br>entrepreneurial person at the top of it<br>driving the business so you know what<br>Don wakes up and says we are going to do<br>autonomous deliveries make it happen it<br>happened within months and actually drew<br>which was Domino's robotic unit that we<br>put on the ground first ever in the<br>industry we had that project builds<br>delivered propellant prototypes it<br>wasn't for one but a prototype delivered<br>working through all of them legislative<br>problems and challenges within about<br>three and a half months so it was a<br>remarkable speed and he just kept the<br>accelerator you know go and go go go go<br>so on that side we have you know this is<br>really really fast moving environment<br>excellent fun but really taxing you know<br>in going within seven months burnt-out<br>cannot live like this this is not a<br>world that I can kind of keep up pace<br>with moving to a speed you have a far<br>more traditional business far more<br>reserved and conservative approach but<br>in the same sense you also have this<br>beautiful kind of considered way of<br>thinking about our customers and our<br>markets and where we're delivering in<br>the strategy sometimes it gets a little<br>frustrating because it's much slower the<br>wheels turn a little slower but you know<br>that it's not a flash in the pan idea<br>from someone who's woken up one more<br>and we are going in that direction you<br>know it's a considered direction where<br>the whole ship is going and it's moving<br>in a reasonable pace to get there and<br>it's taking into account all of the<br>people are bored of that boat that needs<br>to be involved with it so I'm a very<br>different experience and they of course<br>row by a CEO who has been born and bred<br>in a corporate environment and<br>understands you know the frameworks that<br>she needs to work in and and steers the<br>boat in a really well considered manner<br>so very very different environment but<br>not any less with any less appetite for<br>change and innovation and speed as<br>dominoes which is a very very different<br>kind of approach so I've actually I've<br>had more success and have been<br>well-received within they speed that<br>remember was in dominoes because<br>innovation isn't a flash in the pan idea<br>it's a full comprehensive strategy it's<br>cultural change it's a mindset that<br>needs to be kind of filtered and right<br>across the business not in pockets of<br>one or two people there are people have<br>to kind of appreciate that if a business<br>is going to be innovative it's the whole<br>of the business that's innovative<br>because innovation doesn't happen in<br>isolation it doesn't happen in pockets<br>it's not individuals it takes a whole<br>tribe to get really good game-changing<br>ideas from a thought bubble to<br>implementation so so we're developing an<br>ASB a number of strategies to kind of<br>continue our journey of being front foot<br>on innovation and to continue the proof<br>points that people associate with the<br>brand as being innovative and those<br>strategies range from anything from<br>programs for entrepreneurship and<br>education and<br>our people to outreach to universities<br>into startups and engagement models that<br>make sense for all the parties to<br>funding mechanisms to making innovation<br>transparent and also to make it<br>profitable so you know I'm currently now<br>putting ourselves in as a P&amp;L so that<br>anything we put our hand to over a<br>period of time three four five years we<br>can point to the returns of our<br>investment early on in the stage to say<br>well we you know that's when it that's<br>where we contributed to where now that<br>returns come back to us that we are<br>almost becoming a self-sustaining<br>machinery within ASB itself and also<br>we've got the legs to stand up and say<br>well actually look at the dollars it's<br>not just the pretty ideas we don't just<br>do sticky post-it notes on walls we<br>actually return of our activities in our<br>effort over time but it's a long-term<br>play so as you can appreciate all of you<br>or some of you are in corporates<br>Quarterly's matter for everything you<br>know every three months everyone is kind<br>under pressure and delivering on numbers<br>so so anyone in the innovation you know<br>has to kind of hold solid because it is<br>a long-term and it means a bit of<br>bruising it means being kind of tough<br>and robust and kind of be prepared to be<br>questioned and challenged constantly<br>because a lot of the work that we're<br>doing now we may will not see any effect<br>for another three four five years<br>because innovation takes time takes a<br>lot of people it takes time particularly<br>the innovation that I like which is<br>really the industry changing the game<br>changing stuff and when you do that it's<br>not just employees involved it tends to<br>be the government's involved because<br>there's policy changes that are<br>in place there tends to be capital<br>involved in some way in terms of someone<br>is putting in significant investment if<br>it's not the corporate it's so else it<br>tends to be entrepreneurs involved in<br>gravitating around that as well because<br>there's you know this spark of new ideas<br>coming in from other people it tends to<br>be good solid research science<br>technology underpinning it as well<br>that's the fundamental innovation that I<br>really really love and it's one sort of<br>like I kind of grapple with on a regular<br>day to show how it's sort of delivering<br>off on what is it bank delivering a<br>quarter by quarter next we have Chris<br>Quinn who is the CEO of foodstuffs North<br>Island Limited and in fact it was a<br>conversation I heard Chris having at the<br>Icehouse board meeting of which he and I<br>have both on the board of and that Chris<br>is the chair around corporate innovation<br>and what is a different way to do it<br>that really sparked this idea and my<br>mind to have a panel discussion about it<br>so thanks for that Chris before he<br>joined foodstuffs lead a very successful<br>rebrand of Telecom to spark and I think<br>we can all see what an incredible<br>rebrand that was and what a massive<br>success that's been in July 2010 he also<br>received the emerging leader Award at<br>the annual Sir Peter Blake Leadership<br>Awards and he's also received the<br>Chairman's Award of the 2010 two N's<br>Innovation Awards and as I said he is<br>the chair of the ice has bought a role<br>that he really relishes so thank you<br>Chris thank you any and look good<br>morning and fascinating listening<br>already to the stories around the room<br>you know after 24 years in an industry<br>that was forced to innovate very very<br>often because there's not many<br>industries we spend 500 million dollars<br>a year in capital to have your revenue<br>go backwards slowly every year you know<br>and telcos an incredible you know in<br>some ways value destroying industry I<br>think what rival Airlines in many ways<br>so you go from there to an organization<br>that is now 95 years old in New Zealand<br>that you you could argue easily the last<br>innovation foodstuffs did was the<br>establishment of the PAK'nSAVE brand in<br>New Zealand and that's quite exciting<br>when you<br>think about it until you remember that<br>it's 32 years old you know so the the<br>organization has been incredibly<br>successful by changing very little and<br>being very careful for a very long time<br>and when you stand back and look at an<br>organization that turns over seven and a<br>half billion dollars a year and the<br>North Island alone has 1.3 million<br>customers a week going through the<br>stores and in fact the number I keep<br>thinking about is 500,000 transactions a<br>day so anything you plan to do you sort<br>of have this little thing that back of<br>your mind that says don't screw that up<br>because the multiplier effect is rapid<br>and you know so you look at all of that<br>and go how do you think about innovation<br>on that and how do you pull some of the<br>learnings together I think the subject<br>which was why do corporates find<br>innovation so hard as fascinating in<br>itself because I think it has a bias in<br>it that assumes corporates find it hard<br>and we'll talk a little bit about<br>observations between startups and<br>corporates and the attitudes actually<br>one overriding thing for me is you know<br>it's not innovative of no one buys it<br>and I think that's really you know<br>there's a lot of innovation and a lot of<br>tension around innovation that people<br>have in their minds because they just go<br>I love my idea and that's cool as long<br>as you're not the only one and and<br>that's the the thing that we just keep<br>thinking about in terms of innovation is<br>how do you make sure there is a customer<br>base for it that is valuable for someone<br>when I stand back and go what's hard<br>about innovation it's particularly in<br>larger organizations and corporates the<br>first one is if you've got no system no<br>framework of innovation was great you<br>know hearing about the extent to which<br>ASB of thinking about that and I think<br>many of us would say that's probably<br>been the technology brand lead bank and<br>using one for a long time you can see<br>why no courage so no no you know courage<br>to stand up and have something fail and<br>be ok about that no crisis you know it<br>sort of goes with the other one which is<br>if you are too successful as an<br>organization innovation is hard because<br>there is the serious overlay of don't<br> it up<br>you know and that that slows people down<br>a lot around innovation the other one is<br>don't you don't know your customers you<br>know organizations that don't deeply<br>know and understand their customers and<br>the insight find innovation very hard<br>because the innovation comes from<br>customers you know customers will force<br>innovation far quicker than any<br>technology and just deeply understanding<br>not only what customers doing you're<br>organized<br>your value chain but why they do it and<br>what is driving them is the critical<br>thing any organization with a<br>below-the-line cultural blame culture<br>innovations really hard because<br>everyone's hunting for someone to fail<br>and pick them out real quick<br>and the last but that I think is hard<br>about corporate innovation as many<br>startups attitude to corporates working<br>you know being on the team at the ice<br>house has been great because you just<br>you know you are reminded weekly about<br>what it's like to run a business that is<br>struggling to pay next week's wages bill<br>then you go back to the safe blanket of<br>decent revenue and decent earnings and<br>it's just a nice dichotomy to keep<br>working with I've seen you know several<br>startups you know every organization you<br>go to you get them chasing it and<br>presenting their idea and going you know<br>your your company is dead if you don't<br>buy my startup you go well maybe you<br>know and I saw one on social media<br>leading into a thing we had where they<br>said I you know I'm sick of these<br>corporates they're just full of fat lazy<br>middle-aged managers have never worked a<br>day in their life and I thought I am<br>looking forward to your perch you know<br>because and when they purchased I see<br>and just tell me a little bit about that<br>you know and it's just there is we see<br>it all the time right so food industry I<br>have New Zealand fantastic clever<br>interesting New Zealand startups show up<br>with products and they show up in in you<br>know they sort of go I've got this thing<br>and it's amazing and it is and they go<br>my problem is I just can't get it<br>immediately ranged into your stores and<br>you go oh yeah you know just think for a<br>minute you know when you're turning over<br>what we do a year when you have 450<br>stores it probably needs to go into a<br>system so it goes bleep at the checkout<br>and I know that sounds frustrating to<br>you as a start-up but if you want the<br>big prize you know you've got to<br>actually understand your customer and<br>one of the biggest pieces of advice to<br>try and give them as think about the<br>time you put into pitching for<br>investment would it be worth putting<br>about the same amount of time to<br>pitching into a big customer because<br>they generally immersively had a balance<br>on that the most powerful thing any<br>start-up can tell a potential investor<br>is we've got this customer so<br>observations or things to get right<br>about innovation and larger<br>organizations the first one is the<br>strength of customer insightly you've<br>got to know it regularly update it talk<br>about it all the time and have all of<br>your people spending time out in front<br>of customers you know we did a little<br>thing where we rebreather their private<br>label stuff and I I spent about ten days<br>two hours a day in stores talking to<br>customers had the previous brand stuff<br>in their trolleys and just going oh tell<br>me about that you know it was a thing<br>called budget and you found out that<br>customers would only buy it if it was<br>buying for a church of in a social event<br>a school of any sports event they would<br>never buy it for their own cupboards<br>because it made them feel bad right<br>wasn't hard to work out what to do right<br>you know innovate the brain fast you<br>know understanding that 50% of our<br>revenue will come from Millennials and<br>Gen Z within five years and you stand<br>back and go how many of them watch TV or<br>read our newspaper ads you know I'm just<br>so just really understanding customers<br>intimately and talking about a lot the<br>second thing is having owners mindset in<br>the business so the Domino story you<br>know fantastic in terms of the owners<br>mindset living through a lot quite a<br>large organization we have it we have<br>450 of them they would call themselves<br>innovators I'd call some of them off the<br>planet but you know the the the everyday<br>innovation that goes on you know when<br>you have a model like a co-op or a<br>franchise<br>everyday they can walk out make a change<br>in store try it measure it try again so<br>that very fast cycle innovations<br>actually core in the culture it's just<br>how do you bring it right up through and<br>diversity and teams is critical<br>absolutely critical I mean proper<br>diversity diversity of style and thought<br>and and mindset you know as well as<br>gender race culture but but if you've<br>got that then you're going to get ideas<br>that you would not have thought of<br>because of your context so constantly<br>finding that diversity and tapping it<br>and leaders really met us you know like<br>you have to have leadership tolerant of<br>innovation on tolerant of failure<br>actually that goes with it you've got a<br>partner or acquired disruption oh when<br>do you mention you know should we just<br>buy a start-up to work with and I agree<br>that's a dangerous thing to do it<br>because quite often you just kill a<br>start-up but but what you should be<br>doing is working out how to partner with<br>how to be challenged by an example when<br>he mentioned so we recently you know<br>that the meal categories gone big in New<br>Zealand my food bag and others have done<br>a fantastic job they've established a<br>category and a need so we decided we<br>needed to play hard into the category<br>you know the normal process in our<br>business 9 to 12 months at least to get<br>out so we partnered through ice house<br>with an entrepreneur basically set it up<br>that way where we gave them an<br>allocation occasion said you've got this<br>much cash to get through this point in<br>terms of market<br>development and then if you're on target<br>will will cashflow you again if you're<br>not will stop right and that gave them<br>the permission to do it all the ways<br>that made sense and to try stuff that we<br>would not have naturally tried inside<br>the organization the team was made up<br>50/50 so 50 percent of people to knew<br>how we worked about had the right<br>mindset 50% of externals and they just<br>go at it and come back to us about once<br>a month of an update to an advisory<br>board right and it's worked we've now<br>got a product market shifting about 500<br>units a week across six doors and we're<br>ready to sort of go bigger so it's you<br>know been a nice example for us you've<br>got a budget to fail so you have to fund<br>innovation somehow right it has to have<br>a return and what we're trying to get to<br>as a mindset that basically says we need<br>to save twice as much as we spend on<br>innovation<br>so just constantly thinking because<br>innovation is risky not everything's<br>going to work and pay off so we just we<br>try and think about that and a fresh<br>collective which is a brain we just<br>launched you know if you followed the<br>little innovation path overseas research<br>understanding your customer insight<br>deeply open the first one on the North<br>Shore and constellation drive change it<br>about a hundred percent for the second<br>one in Elberton and the third one will<br>sort of be better again and this is<br>happening in about 8 to 12 week cycles<br>which is quite different for us and it's<br>off customer feedback so it's just<br>constantly asking customers what they<br>think being installed with them<br>listening watching right and the<br>original prototype of that we did in an<br>old Foursquare and Penn Muir by the<br>roundabout where we strip the building<br>out and basically built polystyrene<br>store inside it's like walking on the<br>moon and there it's weird but but we had<br>hundreds of people go through it and<br>just go what do you think what do you<br>think we would you put this where would<br>you move that and that was the sort of<br>design process that wasn't 2d drawings<br>it was a 4d experience that we learned<br>from and you can change quickly the last<br>thing I'd say about successes you've got<br>to harness the organization somehow any<br>attitude that says you're in the nan and<br>of a tough part of the company you know<br>it's a really cool conversation to have<br>what people right so you've just got to<br>say everybody can contribute everybody<br>can chip and you have to have a<br>framework for gathering their ideas<br>showing them you've heard them and<br>quickly responding you know and the<br>response quite often will be no not<br>right for us or doesn't fit or yes we're<br>going to get behind it<br>this is what we're going to do and but<br>you've got to have that framework so a<br>few thoughts on how to make a week thank<br>you thank you very much Chris it was<br>absolutely fascinating now we have dawn<br>amo and she is the director of<br>innovations and ventures of PwC now dawn<br>calls herself a self disruptor now I've<br>not met anyone who's called himself the<br>self disruptor but she has a lot of<br>experience of startups and corporate<br>businesses and certainly moving into PwC<br>she's seen a whole different culture in<br>terms of how they're innovating and what<br>they're doing with their clients I don't<br>actually remember calling myself a self<br>a disruptor but I guess that lends to my<br>personality which is as I get different<br>information and inputs then I am a<br>person that will change so I love<br>feedback and so as I'm talking I'm going<br>to be looking at your faces to see if<br>I'm hitting the point or not and we've<br>had some really great points about<br>innovation so far and what I want to do<br>is not reiterate those but maybe look at<br>it in a slightly different way and if we<br>go back to the subject of wires that had<br>for corporates to do innovation I think<br>we need to look at corporates itself and<br>I'm going to be very general because I<br>can't talk about specifics we don't have<br>enough time but when we look at a<br>corporate we visualize a certain type of<br>company so it's large it's got a lot of<br>hierarchy in it there's a lot of people<br>involved and I think when we look at<br>that at a level down and understand what<br>that hierarchy brings and what it means<br>to manage so many people they are really<br>really internally focused because of go<br>get everybody doing the same vision yeah<br>and they introduced hierarchy because<br>they've got to get their communication<br>going and all the different levels and<br>what that does is that creates a really<br>big challenge for somebody or creating<br>innovation internally because you've got<br>a set of people who are absolutely<br>amazing at what<br>on a daily basis and you're asking them<br>to change you're asking them to do<br>something different to what they do<br>every day and I've been told in the past<br>you have built our success you have made<br>us be the large corporate that we are<br>today but now I need you to change that<br>I need you to do something different<br>that's super frightening that's really<br>scary for those people and so when you<br>go to them and go okay we're going to be<br>an innovative company now that has<br>little meaning to them what will happen<br>is these barriers will come up and<br>they'll be like oh my god oh my god I<br>have to stop doing what I do what do I<br>do now<br>and so when Chris was talking about how<br>you need to have it in all parts of the<br>business that's what it is you need to<br>not only have an amazing strong version<br>like the Domino's guy but you also need<br>to have the outcomes that you want but<br>the part them between and that's where<br>people get lost that's like okay we can<br>talk at this really really high level<br>and we know this is what we want to at<br>the end of it but how do I get there how<br>do we go from that to that and that's<br>what my speciality is and that's what we<br>are attempting to do inside the<br>innovation hub at PwC and I totally<br>agree that innovation is not for one<br>area and so we've taken that on board<br>and even though we're a single group and<br>I know that in in our area inside PwC<br>they look at us and they're like those<br>innovation people just as well they're<br>doing it we have to focus on doing the<br>our daily stuff we have to operate the<br>company we have to get the money in<br>they're just going to spend it so what<br>we do is we're very conscious of that<br>and we try and make our contact points<br>with the other people in the business<br>really human and so we're talking to<br>them in the context of what it is and<br>their role and we show them what's<br>possible and we show them what's<br>possible by prototyping by talking to<br>customers by bringing the external view<br>into the company and show them so that<br>they can make a decision they can think<br>about it<br>they're the specialists in their role<br>there's no way that I can come into<br>their business and go this is the way<br>you should be doing your job from now on<br>but what I can do is go hey these are<br>some tools this is a different way to<br>think about it this is potentially a<br>different lens how would you apply it<br>against your job today and by doing that<br>that then gives them a slight jolt but a<br>safe one to go ah I actually maybe I<br>don't have to do it in Excel anymore<br>maybe there's another way to do what I<br>do today and I think that's a really<br>important thing to note when you're<br>trained to change an organization and<br>allow it to be more innovative is that<br>you have to take into consideration what<br>the business model is you have to take<br>into consideration the people that are<br>inside their organization you have to<br>plan for change and Chris definitely<br>outlined that and I just want to<br>underline it and that is you have to<br>plan for it from an executive little<br>level from the middle management level<br>to the daily operations level if there<br>isn't a plan all the way through your<br>business you'll just get pockets and<br>you'll end up with lots and lots of<br>ideas but they never get to fruition<br>they'll never see the light of day and<br>so it's really important that if you're<br>going into an organization to say hey we<br>know how to solve the innovation problem<br>for you we know how we're going to<br>disrupt you you need to make sure that<br>you have the buy-in through the whole<br>company not just one area and I know<br>from my past that I have had some<br>success in some failures where you go in<br>and you know everything and you go in<br>there and you're like I know how to do<br>this yeah this is wrong this is wrong<br>this is wrong and this is wrong you need<br>to change this you need this technology<br>it's done sweet just go and do it now<br>and when you do that you're just handing<br>over a whole lot of stuff but it's not<br>contextualizing it to that particular<br>company and that is really important and<br>that goes to understand your client or<br>understand your customers if you're<br>doing that internally so by<br>understanding you can provide the<br>context by providing context you're<br>providing a path and so I would say<br>those are my key points thank you very<br>much it was a really interesting lens on<br>it to give us a broader perspective of<br>what innovation can be for different<br>companies and I think there was<br>something on what she said about it is<br>about change and it's about the people<br>so next up we have Nicki rice Drake who<br>is the group general manager of digital<br>at Fletcher building now she leads a<br>team of 36 businesses across 40 markets<br>globally so can you imagine what it's<br>like to innovate across that span of<br>cultures time zones and everything else<br>it comes with an organization of that<br>size and 2015 Nicki established a<br>digital Innovation Lab that creates<br>innovate innovative digital products and<br>has delivered seven million dollars in<br>EBIT over the last two years so I think<br>there's proof that innovation can be<br>profitable innovation means a lot of<br>different things to different people I<br>think if I ask each of you what<br>innovation meant to you I think they'll<br>get a different definition for every<br>single person in this room am i right<br>for me innovation means delivering value<br>but in a bold way but there's a scale<br>right so you've got innovation from the<br>micro innovation all the way through<br>disruption and I think this is why it<br>gets confusing for people around Y<br>corporates who can't innovate and in<br>terms of a perception because I don't<br>believe that's true I've been involved<br>with corporates they've been innovating<br>right from the very first point in my<br>career when I was a founding employee<br>for ekstra and that was a mess<br>have changed not for not just for<br>Telecom but for New Zealand as a whole<br>it was in the early days of putting the<br>internet in the hands of every person in<br>New Zealand and that was really<br>interesting because when we first<br>started our business case for ekstra was<br>to get a hundred thousand people online<br>in our first year who knows how many we<br>got in the first year a million people<br>online in our first year and that was<br>the start of a massive transformation<br>for New Zealand in terms of getting<br>online and I've been involved in a few<br>different companies over the course of<br>my career I worked for a Canon in Europe<br>and we invested in a little startup that<br>created a technology that enabled you to<br>save the photos from your camera online<br>so that you would have access to them<br>this was in about 2002 and now look at<br>your photo sharing online you know it's<br>everywhere in that organisation that we<br>invested in wanted to create a cloud<br>hosting service and we built that and it<br>was fantastic and in Amazon launched<br>into the market so we had to close it<br>down so innovation is also about timing<br>it's creating the value but at the right<br>time with the right customer and really<br>understanding what your customers want<br>as well when I returned to New Zealand<br>four years ago I was lucky enough to<br>reconnect with a lot of my extra<br>colleagues who had were starting spark<br>benches roads nor grass was someone I<br>worked with an extra and I joined that<br>team at the start spike ventures and<br>over their course of that first year we<br>established five businesses into the<br>market of which all are still operating<br>now there's you know you can look at<br>that in a number of different ways but<br>for organization to spin up five<br>businesses in the year is quite an<br>achievement but the other thing that's<br>really lasting about their organization<br>as we introduced new ways of working the<br>culture of working connecting with<br>customers understanding your customers<br>bringing their insight into your<br>organization and then working in an<br>agile iterative lean customer centric<br>way to bring those ideas to life and<br>then I moved from there working for for<br>a bank and looking at well how can you<br>in<br>in a bank and actually bring that<br>customer insight into your strategy and<br>we worked with for four months to<br>understand what should the future branch<br>footprint look like based on the the<br>changing nature of customer needs<br>what should the interior of that look<br>like and how do you integrate the online<br>and offline world within oh and a branch<br>footprint and there was a really fun<br>piece of work and then it Fletcher's now<br>there's a very kind introduction around<br>what we've achieved at Fletcher's but<br>you know the thing that's really made a<br>difference at Fletcher's is the cultural<br>change<br>when I started there two and a half<br>years ago and I started talking about<br>digital I may as well be talking another<br>language and it's like what what's all<br>this stuff you're talking about how is<br>this relevant and I'm like well how are<br>you getting your orders into your<br>business<br>oh well 50% of them are coming in by fax<br>or on a piece of water and a piece of<br>jib you know or they just come in<br>rocking to their branch and say I need<br>this and how was that really helping you<br>be efficient and having the right<br>conversations with your customers when<br>you're just dealing with this you know<br>huge wads of paper everywhere and you<br>get you cement dust and you rainin and<br>you know you can imagine what what<br>that's like<br>you know and there's been a fantastic<br>opportunity to be working at Fletcher's<br>it's built in ecosystem of businesses 36<br>different businesses all doing different<br>things going in different directions<br>trying to achieve different things<br>trying to get people who are used to<br>digging up holes in the ground and<br>putting in pieces of jib in the wall to<br>understand how the digital can really<br>enable that business has been quite fun<br>and quite challenging but you know what<br>really works is getting out in the<br>business with your hard hat on in your<br>boots and talking to the people on the<br>on the shop floor or talking to the<br>customers that are rolling in and their<br>truck and you know what are you doing<br>here you don't look like you should be<br>on the floor having conversations with<br>people and understanding what they're<br>trying to do and it's not just wanting<br>to know who they are but it's really<br>understanding how we fit into their work<br>and their life and what it is that we're<br>doing that's helping them or hindering<br>them and one of the applications<br>we created was a specification tool work<br>for one of our Australian businesses<br>they're an installation business and<br>they had a team of four people who would<br>create these specifications for<br>insulation for their architects and<br>specified as who wanted a specification<br>to put into their consenting process and<br>it would take them two or three weeks to<br>create the specification it's really<br>complex a lot of mess a lot of standards<br>a lot of information that has to come<br>into it and we've managed to boil that<br>down into a very simple app that they<br>were able to download themselves from<br>the app store they are now able to do<br>all of those specifications themselves<br>instead of doing four or five<br>specifications a month we are now doing<br>four hundred specifications a month and<br>there at which cost us about 70 grand<br>make has generated over a million and a<br>half of EBIT and the time that has been<br>launched and it's continuing to add<br>value but what we did differently was<br>their application we didn't just put it<br>on the App Store and so you go download<br>it here you go we actually went and<br>engaged with our customers and said well<br>we've got this new tool that can<br>probably help you and here's how it<br>works and here's how you get involved in<br>here's some training for a lot of people<br>in the building community technology can<br>be quite intimidating you know they<br>don't necessarily use technology in<br>their in their day-to-day for it's not<br>true for everyone but for a big chunk of<br>out the people that we engage with so we<br>had to handhold them through that<br>process and really manage the onboarding<br>of the people onto their technology<br>we've we had another example where a<br>customer said we want to EPP because our<br>competitors have got one yeah oh that's<br>great so we went out and we talked to<br>their customers and said what are you<br>trying to do how would how would this<br>kind of technology work for you and by<br>the way how how is this technology that<br>you're our computer is using and they<br>said well we've I know they've got their<br>app but we don't use it because if we<br>send in effects you know and if there's<br>an error or the company takes<br>accountability for that if I use this<br>tool there's no question that I know<br>about whether I made a mistake or not so<br>I take accountability for it so we don't<br>use it and that's right well how do you<br>get around there you know it's really<br>about understanding what it is it's good<br>in the way of their adoption as well and<br>how you can incentivize people to<br>actually use the innovations that you're<br>creating and on their to school moment<br>I'm gonna start off with some questions<br>I'm sure you've all got questions as<br>well and in fact I know you care because<br>I saw them when you are is being paid<br>and it was wonderful to see the level of<br>interest and this topic so the question<br>I have is you know we hear a lot about<br>innovation and then we hear about not<br>wanting to ruin the business Chris you<br>use much more colorful language than<br>there too so how do you balance the need<br>to keep on I guess growing testing<br>things out risking value of ensuring<br>that the solid business stays solid so<br>they might start with their<br>I can I can give it a go I think it's<br>really important to test so don't do a<br>really big test do a really little test<br>and figure out what it what your<br>objective is of course send your<br>hypotheses and then make a little test<br>and then see what the feedback is so an<br>example of that would be we're working<br>on something at the moment which is<br>around helping people with retirement<br>for example instead of building the<br>software from in to end and then doing<br>the bigger unveil what I did is I did<br>some sketches using a very basic tool<br>and then started using that to start a<br>conversation to be able to get people to<br>think about it and also to get end user<br>feedback on whether or not it's a good<br>idea by doing that I know okay does it<br>have legs or dozen that it leaks if it<br>doesn't have legs that's probably a sure<br>path to failure if it does have legs<br>then well what I'll do is I'll grow it a<br>little bit more I'll invest a little bit<br>more time around that and so then in<br>each stage I do it like a layer and<br>layering of a cake and as I build it up<br>it gets a richer and richer experience<br>around it and at each layer I just keep<br>checking with people internally and<br>externally is this a thing and then with<br>that it means that you're more likely to<br>be able to get the bad ideas out quickly<br>without little effort and then you've<br>got the good ideas you're putting the<br>investment and so you're likely to get<br>some money and some return back for it<br>yeah<br>Rosy's it doesn't have to be like I can<br>do a sketch in 20 minutes and then start<br>talking to people I think it's when you<br>timetable everything it becomes a very<br>long process I think if you have the<br>room to be able to just do then it can<br>be a very fast process so having that<br>space is really important and having<br>that connection to customers which is<br>what Chris was talking about is super<br>important as well because otherwise who<br>can you ask for the feedback well I<br>guess in my experience another technique<br>you can try is establish it if it's a<br>bigger disruption establishing a<br>completely separate brand that has no<br>visible connection to the mother company<br>can be a good way to start and and<br>involve that organization until such<br>time as you can perhaps bring it in and<br>perhaps Chris might have seen it happen<br>knowing customers intimately testing we<br>passed safely in particular and in<br>having very good responsive feedback so<br>for us innovation cycles can be 24 hours<br>so they can go out get a customer<br>reaction you carry on or not carry on so<br>they're breaking it down into little<br>chunks they making sure there was our<br>customer reason you've tried it and<br>being very clear about how you gonna<br>measure success and these are outcome<br>that we're going to engage customers you<br>know what you it's funny Microsoft have<br>done this for hundred years right they<br>they put our unfinished product we will<br>test it report the boats and they bring<br>out another one and another one you know<br>and it's just we were all very used to<br>that so I think there's just so much<br>so how do you inspire your leaders and<br>your organizations that's just muscle<br>from my point of view it's really about<br>a servant leadership style and it's<br>really about being humble and putting<br>things out there but and enabling people<br>to pull the new ideas and the new ways<br>of working and being very careful not to<br>polarize people with you or your<br>language some of the language that has<br>evolved from the sort of adjoining<br>customer-centric ways of working those<br>words and themselves it can be extremely<br>polarizing because if you're not<br>familiar with it<br>you immediately think oh I don't know<br>what that means so you you're on the<br>backfoot so trying to dumb down the<br>language or simplify it know you know to<br>stop using weasel words as a really good<br>stir I think what's really important is<br>a lot of people have vague ideas what<br>innovation is you know I guess we<br>suggested we all have different<br>interpretations of it often I think<br>people talk hurt a little bit in terms<br>of like whatever intervention is Martin<br>can deliver so in terms of leadership<br>across the baby I think we try to make<br>it as real as possible we have a lot of<br>kind of<br>beautiful process people they love<br>systems and their infrastructure and<br>they love a method and and so what we've<br>done is really really reinforced the<br>fact that innovation isn't accidental it<br>is can be quite systematic it is quite<br>methodical there are algorithms that<br>kind of make it work and we point out<br>very clearly what those algorithms are<br>so for all of those process people<br>across the bank they go right I get it<br>I can cling to the formula I get what<br>you're trying to do it's not just a kind<br>of an accidental creative process and if<br>it is there's a system for bringing that<br>creative accidental anomalies into the<br>business as well and capturing them and<br>kind of working with them I will add one<br>since the other three of God um it's<br>storytelling it's taking people along a<br>journey and I think when we talk to the<br>executive team internally inside PwC we<br>have to realize that they don't know<br>everything that we know and so it does<br>mean that we need to elaborate we can't<br>just show them something that we<br>actually have to talk them through and<br>explain what the potential outcomes are<br>the question for me was working in a new<br>culture of a cooperative and here's the<br>need to create a change but at the same<br>time initiate that chain<br>there's a landscape you talk a bit about<br>how you brought the corporate members<br>into the process of having to make<br>record to see look I think you know<br>everyone says all your work at a<br>cooperative house they're expecting you<br>to declare some new disease know that<br>two or three observations first one is a<br>cooperative is the ultimate quality<br>filter because there is a danger in<br>corporates that bosses can say do this<br>because it's their personal belief and<br>people find blindly whereas in a<br>cooperative you just get a feeling you<br>know on a good day you get a hand up on<br>another day you get a digit you know the<br>corporate of one where people goes oh no<br>that's not right for my customer so I'm<br>not doing it there's a fantastic quality<br>lift up you know because they're really<br>just you know I keep talking to my team<br>because the quality of conversations and<br>they come and say I've got this great<br>idea of the stores just won't do it and<br>the first question is is it a great idea<br>you know how do you know it's great idea<br>and what's the story you're telling what<br>that and all those things so that's<br>missing signaling as cooperatives all<br>about just getting to things and perfect<br>balance which we never get perfect don't<br>you just got to keep thinking about them<br>the first one is agility of decision<br>making so we know that in the hands of<br>the leadership team I've chosen to a<br>point you pay to do a job versus depth<br>of consultation we should you slow down<br>and deeply consult and make sure you<br>take the learning and the the view of<br>all of the co-operative shareholders the<br>owners of our company so just getting<br>that right agility in there you know the<br>number we sell about 30 to see more per<br>square meter than our main competitor<br>there is something in the intensity<br>manager that makes that happen I thanks<br>I'm Andy<br>previously worked for Telstra<br>Corporation to paint a picture was<br>49,000 staff it was a true global we ran<br>two internal incubators for own staff no<br>aim development<br>two of my customers are sitting here<br>Fletcher's and of course the<br>Commonwealth ASP curiously my question<br>to you folks is how does how do your<br>organization's or do<br>your organization's currently mine the<br>ideas of your staff do you mine and<br>catch them and Lee you made a very good<br>point management and leadership and you<br>know pretty strong corporates tends to<br>be very waterful top-down bottom-up and<br>quite restrictive because no one wants<br>to be seen to be cleverer than their<br>manager so how do you your<br>organization's go about their aunt Astra<br>we tend it into a game but I'll share<br>that after the discussion of how we<br>so what in flexures we really value the<br>ideas of anyone at any level and when we<br>launched their innovation there but it<br>was very much about how do we get ideas<br>from everyone into our pipeline of ideas<br>to process we've processed maybe over I<br>have 800 ideas maybe more and you know<br>object we've only delivered 26 of those<br>ideas into actually working solutions<br>but the way that we do there is a three<br>different ways when we had workshops<br>with all of the general managers -<br>firstly get them inspired and we<br>explained all the different options and<br>the possibilities so demos and all of<br>that kind of stuff but at the end of<br>every workshop it was an ideation<br>session so here's a business challenge<br>since you're in the room lift id8 on<br>what you might want to do to solve some<br>of these challenges and then we do those<br>same workshop type formats it really<br>build an organization but it's a pull<br>model who wants to ask to come in and<br>run that kind of workshop we also do<br>strategy sessions where we look at a<br>particular business problem or business<br>process and look for the opportunities<br>across there all of the pain points and<br>look for the opportunity to solve that<br>and we also have the ability on our<br>internet for anyone to submit an idea<br>and we've had a lot of ideas through<br>that that channel and then just<br>generally getting out into the<br>businesses and explaining and showcasing<br>what we're doing is also encouraging<br>other people to put up ideas and some of<br>the ideas are coming from people on the<br>shop floor people who are just working<br>in a cleaning role there's all sorts of<br>different ideas that come through and we<br>take every one of those ideas seriously<br>but we always put the question back to<br>them you know what probably trying to<br>soul<br>and what value do you think there is and<br>actually solving this problem and<br>through that conversation you really can<br>start to understand more about what's<br>what the problem is but when then we<br>don't take it at face value we then go<br>out and engage with customers or people<br>who are impacted by that problem to<br>really dig into what it is and a lot of<br>times you find the actual problem it's<br>quite different to what they assumed it<br>was Thanks so we tried to monetize the<br>ideation process as much as possible<br>when the innovation process across the<br>bank would do that bad things and so on<br>so we're using at the moment at all core<br>speakers some of you might have heard<br>about this cruddy city there's a whole<br>bunch of them we're pretty much the<br>crowd votes the ideas up or down so<br>someone we've got a challenger to the<br>business and that's usually that<br>challenge is strategically aligned it's<br>come from a leadership but I'm about to<br>present I'm about to our leadership<br>today actually tasks the next challenge<br>to put out to the business that good<br>such that shines a light on a particular<br>area where the bank wants to focus and<br>then we allow the bank to respond right<br>across the business so 5,000 people have<br>the opportunity to submit their ideas<br>and then 5,000 people have the<br>opportunity to then decide which are the<br>ones that worth investing and have merit<br>so we try and take panel decisions we<br>try and take middle management<br>decision-making out of the process and<br>we let the kind of the whole business<br>decide where you know what gets up in<br>terms of where the light is shining for<br>the bank in terms of the strategy from<br>there we we're going through a process<br>narrow which has kicked off or we're in<br>the middle of a pilot to another one<br>towards the end of the year where we are<br>running a mini accelerator inside the<br>house where those when people have been<br>selected<br>some of the basis that they submitted<br>nineteen that was popular with the<br>community that they've gone through a<br>serious back face and things to show<br>that they're resilient and the robust<br>and the resourceful we've extracted them<br>out of the business and now they are<br>kind of running their own there are<br>adventures forward of a better word and<br>we the first opening statement of that<br>cohort when they kicked off is I don't<br>care for GM your head of your grad level<br>titles go out the door now you are<br>founders of adventure and you work<br>together equally so we've got five teams<br>were running through one of those teams<br>is actually being grown by a grant who's<br>just literally stepped out of university<br>she's taken on board that she's the CEO<br>and she's got kind of a senior level<br>manager now that she's sort of saying<br>right we're going to do this really man<br>she's giving the direction to that<br>particular venture so we we've taken the<br>high or we've attempted you know we try<br>to get through some hurdles with it but<br>we've been tempted to take a hierarchy<br>out and allow people to actually use<br>their natural skills they're resourceful<br>nurse their ability to deal with<br>ambiguity that sometimes that wouldn't<br>come through if they were kind of in a<br>hierarchical title position with in the<br>moment that's great what great answers<br>thank you so we need to close now<br>because it's 8:30 and I appreciate that<br>some of you probably got nine o'clock<br>meetings to get back to before you close<br>I just want to sum up with probably the<br>four things that are really struck for<br>me if you want to create an animation<br>successfully in corporate in interesting<br>start to see the first one is courage<br>and it really is courage to take a new<br>idea to really risk failure and the<br>consequences of that the next one of<br>course is culture and we've heard about<br>how important it is to really get people<br>on board to empower them to have the<br>ideas particularly adjust to ASB how<br>they can vote on the ideas that go<br>forward then customers how closer you<br>need to your customers what are their<br>problems that you have to solve to<br>innovate and I think we hear from<br>cressid I think I'm going to walk into a<br>mock-up store on polystyrene it's pretty<br>cool and there is a real for T<br>experience and then lastly you have to<br>create value we talk about innovation<br>being an idea with impact and I think<br>all of us would agree that New Zealand<br>isn't fantastic at coming up with ideas<br>and inventions but I think there's a gap<br>to go before we really commercialize and<br>the same range as we come up with these</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
