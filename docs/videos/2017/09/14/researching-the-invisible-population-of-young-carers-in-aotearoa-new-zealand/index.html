Lauren Donnan was a young carer growing up, and is now researching into this often invisible group of people. Her PhD examines the lived experiences of NZ young carers, and aims to use young carers’ own understandings of theirs’ and their families’ needs to expand and inform service provision and policy in NZ.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi my name is Lauren Donnan and I'm a<br>researcher at the University of Auckland<br>Faculty of Education and social work my<br>research looks into the experiences of<br>young carers young carers are children<br>and young adults who take on a<br>significant and ongoing caring role for<br>someone with a disability and illness<br>substance misuse mental illness or who's<br>elderly young carers are a really hidden<br>population in New Zealand I myself am a<br>young carer and I didn't even realize it<br>until a few years ago when I was 14 my<br>mum passed away and because my dad was<br>an international flight attendant he was<br>away a lot of the time my eldest brother<br>beefy has autism and an intellectual<br>disability so when my dad was away it<br>was my job to care for beefy but I never<br>actually knew that there was this thing<br>called young caring I felt really alone<br>and isolated and my caring role I never<br>met another young carer and never<br>thought that anyone else would be doing<br>that kind of role at my age there are no<br>services for young carers there's no<br>policy for young carers<br>there's only for published studies and<br>there's no groups bringing young carers<br>together overall young carers are a<br>completely hidden group in New Zealand<br>and I knew that something needed to be<br>done about that my PhD is so exciting<br>it's all about gathering young carers<br>together hearing their voices about<br>their experience of being young carer<br>and what theirs and their family's needs<br>are then I can take the young carers own<br>voices and bring about change in New<br>Zealand and policy services research and<br>in society the real difficulty with my<br>study as<br>young carers themselves don't even know<br>that their young carers so how can they<br>come forward to be part of my study even<br>if they want to I had to get really<br>creative with my data collection methods<br>I filmed my experience and I shared it<br>via social media and it wasn't long<br>until I got young carers coming forward<br>to be part of my study in the end 44<br>young carers came forward to be part of<br>my study they were diverse and their<br>ethnicity they were diverse and the<br>agendas ages from all over New Zealand<br>in these interviews we just talk<br>together about our young caring<br>experiences and young carers told me<br>that these interviews were often the<br>first time they had been able to talk<br>about their young caring experience as<br>you can imagine they were really<br>emotional interviews we often cried<br>together but we also laughed and print<br>disbelief together and there was the<br>sense of finding each other and finally<br>understanding this part of yourself I'm<br>now writing up my thesis and preparing<br>it for submission next year i'm laurin<br>Donnan i'm a young carer and i'm going<br>to bring about change for young carers<br>and New Zealand</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
