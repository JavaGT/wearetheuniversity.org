Texas<br>thank you thank you for those kind words<br>from Helene and Mark and thank you all<br>for coming<br>when I first joined the university I<br>went to a new staff conference and at<br>the evening dinner I was saying extra<br>very amiable did not hear those all can<br>you betcha<br>awesome right sorry I'll start from the<br>beginning when I first joined the<br>university I went to a new staff<br>conference and at the evening dinner I<br>was sitting next to a very amiable woman<br>his daily work took her into the bowels<br>of the clock tower she did that for<br>promotion it was important to get on the<br>right committees so in my own<br>complicated way I said I'll what<br>committees are those and she said to me<br>that when I needed to know I would find<br>out well it's now apparent to me I was<br>already on one of those committees I was<br>by then a para group is issued upon the<br>University Child Care Committee on that<br>committee with me were shorts at Simons<br>now professor of geography<br>Barbara Brooks now professor of history<br>and Barbara had not long become chair<br>succeeding professor Harlan hang the<br>many years ago last summer I decided to<br>return to the completion of my law<br>degree I'd left behind me well those<br>jobs Chartered Accountant and two very<br>small children I'm not quite sure in<br>retrospect why I felt the need to embark<br>on such an undertaking but I did it in<br>late January at yeah when I returned to<br>work I ran and made an appointment to<br>see the Dean and I met with Stuart<br>Anderson who was very helpful in letting<br>me recommence in the middle of the<br>degree without during the but of second<br>year I had left behind had I encountered<br>the contractual mistakes act and column<br>than those öhlins I would not be here<br>today by the end of the first year<br>during jurisprudence and tax I was<br>addicted<br>unlike many people who have spoken<br>started it career as a member of the law<br>faculty staff I don't have a mark in a<br>good engravings story however he did<br>call me one evening about 5:30 I had two<br>slightly bigger but still very young<br>children perhaps a bit tired but never<br>fractious and I was a meal cooking to<br>ask me if I was interested in lecturing<br>position at the university of otago law<br>faculty and so it came to pass with the<br>ink fairly dry on my LLB honours degree<br>I started my academic career here it's<br>turned out to be a fascinating<br>satisfying experience for me and<br>everyone academic and professional staff<br>and students make this law faculty a<br>very special place I must of course<br>mention mark for his positive leadership<br>and his personal support of me<br>particularly enabling Meacham forged<br>links with tech scholars from all around<br>the world and to all of you who have<br>been friends and scholars over the pub<br>and colleagues over the past few years I<br>was rather worried that the university<br>department would be rather too quiet and<br>isolation for my personal taste but it<br>turned out I was not the only one with a<br>tea addiction it also turned out that<br>being put in an office on the eighth<br>floor has been a splendid piece of luck<br>I went to mention also the students we<br>wouldn't be here but for them and I<br>acknowledge especially the honors<br>students I've worked with their research<br>has often be very helpful springboard<br>for my own work and I particularly want<br>to mention those who have done advanced<br>acts because in those classes I have<br>been able to firm up some of my own<br>thoughts of course on this journey I had<br>been on since I joined the faculty it<br>would not have been possible without<br>support and patience and the sounding<br>board at home without the support of<br>Trevor and tournament Alexandra I<br>couldn't have embarked on that indulgent<br>folly of a law degree<br>much less forged a career as an academic<br>lawyer as Harleen said Trevor and Tim<br>are here tonight and many of you will<br>know that our daughter and sister<br>Alexandra died in the winter of 2012<br>halfway through her law and French<br>degrees I think the three of them for<br>their constant presence in my life and<br>at this point those of you<br>didn't know Alexander would know she'd<br>be saying get on with it and so I shall<br>as has been said I've got two distinct<br>areas of research taxation and capital<br>market regulation that phrase trips<br>easily off my tongue I've used it in<br>every promotion and progression<br>application I've ever written and this<br>is a nod to Richard and every PBR F rich<br>research profile I have ever Russian<br>thinking about this talk made me think<br>was there something I could discuss that<br>would link them and I can't think of<br>anything so I have decided not to why<br>such distinct strands of research when I<br>was a teenager I clearly remembered my<br>music teacher telling me after I<br>couldn't be at something to do with<br>music because I had to be somewhere else<br>but I was a jack of all trades and<br>master of none that might well be true<br>but talking about that would lead me to<br>a more public display of self-reflection<br>that I would ever want to engage and so<br>leave that for right now the more<br>practical and prosaic reason as I was<br>hired specifically to teach tax and<br>capital market regulation and university<br>teaching as research informed teaching<br>and that's where my research path today<br>so since I can't combine the two as you<br>can see by the topic of this talk I've<br>chosen to talk about my tax research so<br>what about my tax research well there<br>are any amendments every year to the<br>income tax Act but the changes that are<br>made are really of any significance so<br>that didn't seem like a particularly<br>fulfilling research pathway the one area<br>that did perhaps him a little more<br>fruitful was as a research thing was tax<br>avoidance but that was a very crowded<br>academic space bin tree things happened<br>I read an article by Phillip Baker an<br>English tech silk formerly a full-time<br>academic and presently a visiting<br>professor at Oxford it was entitled<br>taxation and the European Convention on<br>Human Rights and then in 2003<br>Saraiva Richardson then recently retired<br>as prisons of the Court of Appeal<br>now the keen-eyed among you will see<br>that that is not an effect so either<br>speaking to the text class that's me and<br>that's are either sitting in the back I<br>think what's also notable about that<br>wonderful photo is not one student has a<br>laptop and this thingy at the front does<br>not look like the bridge of the Starship<br>Enterprise back then<br>chali deserve Iver afterwards he said<br>he'd often wondered why the Bill of<br>Rights Act had been so little used in<br>non criminal areas of the law so Philips<br>article and survivors comment set me off<br>on what has actually been the dominant<br>theme of my research is tax Public Law<br>and if it is why does it seem so<br>different why is texture from should it<br>be internationally there are a number of<br>scholars who think about this and as<br>fruit to rather grandly as tax<br>exceptionalism but there's only one<br>aspects are really a bigger question for<br>in many instances in many ways taxes<br>thought of has been part of commercial<br>law and in that context it also seems<br>quite different from other areas of law<br>for many lawyers and particularly for<br>law students Texas scene has been in its<br>own special box somehow disconnected<br>from law its specialized distinct odd<br>opaque difficult weird not quite like<br>you nothing else at least in respect of<br>income tax that oddness is probably a<br>result of the fact that to state the<br>obvious income tax is levied on income<br>but what income is is a much more<br>complex and elusive concept than we<br>might first think indeed a strange<br>analyzes no such income tax legislation<br>deals with a wholly artificial universe<br>constructed by law now if you're not<br>immediately thrilled by the thought that<br>you're not going to hear about that<br>tonight let me assure you that you<br>probably should be in effect I see some<br>people in the audience who have been in<br>my text classes and they'll know exactly<br>why you should missive you should be<br>pleased so my research has been to think<br>about text it's a species of public law<br>and what I want to do in this talk<br>to think about the symptoms and the<br>causes of this apparent oddity that<br>Texas some have not really law so rather<br>than talk about my personal research<br>journey I thought I would explore the<br>journey of tax law as a subject both in<br>teaching and in research and through<br>that lens I hope to explore the more<br>general theme of this talk which is<br>thinking about tax as law fifty years<br>ago the aforementioned Saraiva<br>Richardson and people who've done<br>taxation paper will recognize him as the<br>hero of that course was a professor at<br>the law faculty in Victoria University<br>and he delivered his inaugural<br>professorial lecture he ended by<br>reflecting on the ongoing problems and<br>issues and he discussed by saying what<br>I've got there and the point I have<br>emphasized as he's talking about tax law<br>as a developing subject in 1943 the<br>United States Supreme Court had said<br>that no other branch of the law touches<br>human activities at so many points why<br>twenty years later was at study<br>described as developing by 1967 there<br>was nothing particularly novel about the<br>phenomenon of Taxation there was a land<br>tax in England when William the<br>Conqueror ordered the doomsday survey in<br>296 there was a sort tax in China about<br>a thousand BC the 18th century English<br>window tax is relatively well known and<br>the Boston Tea Party protests at tax on<br>teeth in 1773 is probably even better<br>known in New Zealand the government had<br>raised revenue in addition to the<br>proceeds from land sales for a host of<br>excise in Texas and duties in the<br>nineteenth century<br>Alaine Texas passed in 1878 was enforced<br>for a year when the change of government<br>lyrics been replaced by a property tax<br>it also became extraordinarily unpopular<br>and it was ultimately replaced by the<br>land and income tax act 1981 1991 1891<br>before World War one learned tax and<br>excise duties were the principal source<br>of revenue but thereafter income tax<br>increasingly became the predominant tips<br>by 1916 the income tax part of the<br>statute was in the structure in which it<br>would broadly remain until 1994 why then<br>would professor Richardson describe tax<br>law as a developing subject some 80<br>years after the enactment of the land<br>and income tax act in 2006 I wrote in a<br>review of a book the taxes and subject<br>lawyers often shy away from as a result<br>Chartered Accountants of established<br>virtual Higa mean over tax practice by<br>the middle of the 20th century the<br>Commissioner of Inland Revenue would<br>report on the close relationship between<br>himself the district commissioners in<br>the taxation commissioners the<br>Committees of the Society of accountants<br>he reported no liaison or relationship<br>with the law societies probably because<br>there was none those comments from<br>survived there acknowledge that tax<br>requires a pluralistic approach and into<br>this goes law and history and philosophy<br>and political science and economics and<br>accounting each of those disciplines has<br>got a lot to contribute and in fact it's<br>thus multi-disciplined I mention that<br>makes tax so endlessly fascinating but<br>in Jewish is important that we continue<br>to think of legal analysis so that other<br>disciplines take into account and<br>properly understand the legal systems<br>and rights and obligations relationships<br>and organizations and procedures but the<br>point I want to think about tonight is<br>subtly different I want to think about<br>what might be lost if Tex law is<br>isolated from other law is there<br>learning in other areas of the law that<br>have been ignored in tax alternatively<br>our other areas of the law missing<br>something by putting tax in a special<br>sealed box so before looking at a couple<br>of shorts particular examples which I<br>think might need some shed some light in<br>that I would just review the teaching of<br>tax and this university and to have a<br>brief look at the history of academic<br>research in tax and because this is<br>history this will explain an awful lot<br>any discussion about the teaching of any<br>subject lords o Targo needs to be<br>thought about in the context of teaching<br>law more generally<br>the full-time University study for an<br>LLB<br>or joint degree completed with a post<br>graduation professionals course has been<br>the model since the 1970s a broad review<br>of legal education since the 19th<br>century reveals a rather checkered story<br>with some particularly weak patches but<br>the overall trajectory through the 20th<br>century was toward increasing numbers of<br>full-time staff with the appointment of<br>its first full-time professor in 959<br>Otago was not an especially fast<br>follower of a trend that had begun many<br>years earlier in Victoria and Auckland<br>universities toward full-time students<br>two years full time at the University<br>was recommended from the mid 1930s and<br>full-time students became the norm in<br>the 1970s and the creation of accounts<br>of legal education in 1930 the content<br>of the law degree changed surprisingly<br>little and that was ladies around the<br>early 1970s that there was any choice of<br>papers in addition to a corps in 1927<br>this is what a law degree looked like if<br>you wanted to be a barrister you had to<br>do an LLB with all that in it if you<br>only wanted to be a solicitor you could<br>choose one of lesson English or<br>philosophy and you didn't have to study<br>Roman or international law this mixture<br>of some general knowledge plus<br>specialized law subject had been the<br>norm by a very long time by 1927<br>practice and procedure had made an<br>appearance of the curriculum and that<br>was the first year that company law was<br>included in the LLB that subject had the<br>same lectures curriculum and teacher as<br>the Faculty of Commerce paper and that<br>was how it remained until the mid 1950s<br>in comparison collar students studied<br>quite a lot of law for instance in 1948<br>accountancy law consisted of mercantile<br>law one and totes and deadly dull<br>company law bankruptcy law and trustee<br>law one lecture per subject a week and<br>I'm almost loathe to mention this at<br>7:45 a.m. Monday to Friday except in the<br>occasional year when the Monday lecture<br>was I think might get Halloween to<br>fillory is at the moment except in the<br>occasional year when the Monday lecture<br>was substituted one on a Saturday this<br>law degree therefore had a very strong<br>common-law flavor very little emphasis<br>on statute law and ass measuring of what<br>we might call practically orange<br>subjects the length of statute law and<br>the degree might seem somewhat<br>surprising in light of the fact that in<br>1927 the New Zealand Parliament enacted<br>77 statutes in the eight volumes of the<br>1931 reprint of the 1908 to 1931<br>statutes there were more than 1500<br>statutes but there was no or little<br>statute law in the degree most of the<br>law students and indeed the graduates in<br>this room will recognize a lot of<br>familiar material in that structure this<br>was the basis of the law curriculum for<br>a very long time and I'd say in many<br>ways it still is New Zealand's legal<br>education has been described by Stuart<br>Anderson has been doctrinally and<br>professionally oriented this has been<br>described in the English context as the<br>classical curriculum so returned to my<br>more specific query what about text as<br>far as I've been able to ascertain<br>text in any form was taught for the<br>first time at o-tar go in 1914<br>preparation of tax returns was one of<br>the topics in a subject called advanced<br>bookkeeping in the Faculty of Commerce<br>by 1920 the land and income tax act 1916<br>was one of the statutes included in<br>there on the bus subject accountancy law<br>now the lead for accountants failed to<br>do this sort of works not surprising in<br>1914 there were fourteen thousand income<br>tax returns filed and by 1929 that<br>number had gone up to fifty five<br>thousand many small traders and<br>businesses no doubt required the<br>services of accountant to complete these<br>returns no wonder that accountancy<br>education responded provided in the<br>skill and the knowledge<br>but in one form or another taxation has<br>been taught continuously to accounting<br>students for over 100 years in 1953<br>taxation finally made its way into the<br>law degree when the subject conveyancing<br>was amended to become conveyancing in<br>taxation conveyancing been taught since<br>about 1928 and was it first called<br>practical conveyancing 1958 prescription<br>for conveyancing and taxation described<br>the taxation content as the law relation<br>to legend income tax gift duty dis du<br>chien conveyance duty they got through a<br>power stuff in those days we'll return<br>to this influence of estates and gift<br>Duty later 1967 the major changed the<br>structure of the LLB degree and<br>conveyancing and Taxation cease to be a<br>subject in the degree for a short period<br>taxation community to be taught in a<br>composite subject with conveyancing but<br>was one that had to be done in addition<br>to the LLB degree as part of the<br>requirements for admission as a<br>barrister and solicitor in 1972 choice<br>appeared in the subjects for the degree<br>for the first time taxation and estate<br>planning became an optional paper but it<br>remains compulsory for admission that it<br>really remained until the end of the<br>1980s from which time the taxation paper<br>became optional for the degree<br>professional qualification was altered<br>to a standalone program administered<br>outside the universities in which<br>taxation did not and does not feature so<br>this brief story indicates that some<br>studies and Taxation have been in<br>compulsory for accountancy students<br>since 1914 for law students there was no<br>opportunity to study tax until 1953 and<br>preparing about thirty years it was a<br>compulsory requirement for admission to<br>practice law but torch I would suggest<br>in a rather practical manner notably<br>when it was compulsory or when it was a<br>part of the professional examinations it<br>was almost always coupled with estate<br>planning tax was there for I think<br>studied by lawyer students in an<br>instrumentalist manner<br>freaking now about academic research on<br>tax through a legal framework how I<br>conducted a very very very very simple<br>survey and I hope no experts on cervezas<br>here by looking at publications in to<br>academic law journals the New Zealand<br>universities Law Review published first<br>to 1963 and to keep this homely the<br>Otago Law Review first published in 1965<br>now the result of this survey didn't<br>particularly surprise me so between 1963<br>and 2002 there were eight articles<br>published in the news in New Zealand<br>universities law review on text measures<br>you'll see actually some old hoary old<br>chestnuts it should we have a capital<br>gains tax twenty AC will be having<br>articles about that too I would venture<br>and the Otago Law Review has a great sum<br>of five but on the stage planning and<br>four on the more esoteric subject of the<br>definition of income yeah this is an<br>incomplete picture focusing on to<br>academic law journals but the figures I<br>think could be useful flavor of the<br>extent of academic legal publications<br>and tax they also highlight what seemed<br>important again we see estate planning<br>and the influence of death duties and we<br>also see this ongoing issue about what<br>on earth is income the importance of<br>those topics can be seen in probably the<br>two major taxation books that were<br>published in New Zealand in that period<br>the 1970s guide to estate duties by<br>edited by sir Ivor Richardson and John<br>pebbles work on the taxation of property<br>transactions published in 1986 John's<br>work I think is probably the first<br>academic legal monograph published and<br>taxation in New Zealand there has<br>however never been a legally oriented<br>textbook in tax what is also notable<br>then although through the 1980s there<br>was a period of significant tax reform<br>there was very little academic writing<br>about tax from a legal perspective<br>there's my list some random sample from<br>a couple of academic journals sure<br>that period did not first a much<br>engagement in such writing although<br>lawyers were involved to some degree in<br>an advisory committees and they've also<br>had looked at the annual reports of the<br>law faculty and the calendars of the<br>University of Otago they indicate that<br>the first text article written by no<br>toggle or academic was by Andrew Beck in<br>1987 the title was text in the academic<br>or ordeal in which he reviewed the<br>income tax deductibility or more<br>accurately non deductibility of research<br>and education costs incurred by<br>academics professor Peter Som who was in<br>fact the second professor of law Jotaro<br>had published about tax but while he was<br>at Auckland so we're not going to count<br>that as far as I can tell he did no tax<br>work once he came to our ger in February<br>1996 a specialist academic Law Journal<br>the New Zealand journal of Taxation law<br>and policy wasn't that it was launched<br>and survivors marks at the launch were<br>published in the first edition he said<br>that more than was most specialties tax<br>work requires an understanding of<br>policies underlying the legislation that<br>was because no other legislation as he<br>said more far-reaching and pervasive the<br>subject matter he deals with he said was<br>comprehensive and complicated and<br>because the legislation can never be a<br>complete code those who interpreted and<br>administered need to have a clear<br>understanding of the economic social and<br>administrative policies underlying it<br>despite this importance he said 30 years<br>after he'd written his inaugural<br>professorial Leitrim Doge only a handful<br>of major policy and principle oriented<br>articles on text subjects have been<br>published New Zealand in recent years<br>tax administration have not been a major<br>field of research even though as he said<br>it raised major questions of the<br>application of public law values that<br>journal was designed to fill the gap<br>although I did not actually read that<br>until somewhat after I had begun writing<br>about texts at most<br>I guess I might say that my own research<br>has tried to fill some of that gap so<br>why was all this so well I think the<br>reason why tax was treated as important<br>for commerce students and more<br>specifically for accountancy students as<br>both self explanatory and self<br>perpetuation preparation of tax returns<br>for small medium and large businesses<br>and individuals provided both a stream<br>of work and was and is a supply of a<br>necessary service the dominance of the<br>accounting profession and tax discourse<br>and its day-to-day interaction with the<br>Inland Revenue department was a natural<br>consequence of that the reasons why law<br>tax remained ignored by the legal<br>profession and by lawyers ro venture<br>rather more complex as we have seen<br>legal education in New Zealand was for a<br>very long time<br>tightly prescribed common law focus and<br>strongly shaped by the needs of practice<br>once estate planning became important in<br>the 1950s and that was given further<br>impetus in the wake of the 1968<br>legislation legal education took a<br>little more notice I've always begun my<br>tax classes by talking about one of the<br>key differences between tax law and<br>other branches of the law and that is<br>there is no mischief in a tax the jaw<br>law generally responds to right wrongs<br>to mediate relationships to allocate<br>risk to punish and deter it responds to<br>such things as he hurt someone<br>she stole his money there's a snail in<br>my ginger beer your contaminant leaked<br>into my water supply you can see I did<br>my legal system children your fence is<br>on my property you sold me a machine and<br>it does not work there's no such<br>mischief in attacks tax is designed to<br>raise revenue the Bill of Rights in 1689<br>established there could be no taxation<br>without the consent of the taxpayer and<br>taxes therefore had to be levied by<br>statute there is no common law of<br>taxation from the start let's go texe a<br>public<br>now it might be thought that that may<br>text an ambiguously law quintessentially<br>law but there's been no to this fact<br>actually set it apart from law as was<br>generally practiced most of those<br>engaged in the practice of law were<br>concerned on a daily basis for the<br>private law of property and contract and<br>wells and succession net of course is<br>the law the classical legal training<br>prepared students for a 19th century<br>lawyer might have said of tax it's law<br>but not as we know it the rise of the<br>regulatory state in the 20th century of<br>which tax and then took or part has<br>changed that but to a large degree<br>old habits have run deep the consequence<br>of two of this fundamental principle of<br>taxation by consent was a tax<br>legislation had to be written as clearly<br>and unambiguously as possible text could<br>only by lit be levied by very clear and<br>precise provisions that also has a<br>number of consequences first because tax<br>is a technical matter that applies to<br>real-life situations of an almost<br>infinite variety the taxation the<br>legislature needs to cover as many<br>situations as as possible because of<br>that and that need for certainty and<br>clarity of statutory embers tax statutes<br>became ever longer and more complex<br>secondly because of that constitutional<br>nature of Taxation tax statutes were<br>interpreted strictly literally by the<br>last quarter of the 20th century there<br>alone distinguish tax statutes from<br>other legislation and additionally as a<br>practical matter administrators not<br>judges had the principal role in<br>interpretation of text statutory<br>provisions the primary role of<br>assessment the quantification of a tax<br>liability lay was an official a member<br>of the executive branch of government<br>and New Zealand that person has been spa<br>styled on the various names was<br>currently the Commissioner of Internal<br>Revenue<br>the very activist<br>sponge required administrative<br>interpretation of the legislation this<br>level of bureaucratic engagement as<br>another point of distinction between tax<br>law in most other areas of the law<br>perhaps is not surprising that tax was<br>perceived as an administrative<br>regulation rather than law discussing<br>the evolution of academic study of<br>texture impression the distinguished<br>legal historian Chantal Stebbins as<br>Russian sitting in this way outside the<br>norms of the legal system and it's key<br>elements at best could perceived as<br>distinct from other branches of English<br>law and at worst does not law at all<br>text was not embraced within the<br>academic of study of law in Britain it<br>seems to me that there has largely been<br>true in New Zealand as well now does<br>this isolation of tax law measure<br>there's just thus an interesting story<br>with some facts and triggers well I<br>think it does measure elsewhere I've<br>described this as the visualization of<br>tax law and I want now to turn to a<br>couple of brief examples of why I think<br>this really does matter there are many<br>examples of thus but I've chosen two<br>that I think demonstrate the<br>implications of leasing tax in its own<br>sealed box as it were the first<br>illustrates that something might be lost<br>to text and it's administration through<br>this categorization the second suggests<br>that other aspects of the law might lose<br>something from treating tax law as<br>exceptional so my first example is the<br>Commissioner Inland Revenue's power of<br>search and seizure at this point I'm<br>about to put up a terrible section judge<br>by 2017 standards of statute writing<br>that is an absolute shocker now I don't<br>expect you to read it<br>section 16 has but up here basically<br>says that the Commissioner of Inland<br>Revenue has at all times full and free<br>access to all lands buildings and places<br>and documents that she considers<br>necessary<br>or relevant for the purpose of powering<br>out any of her functions a warrant is<br>required for access to a private<br>dwelling appear very few constraints on<br>this power Commissioner doesn't have to<br>inform the view there are not less<br>intrusive ways of getting this<br>information all that attacks may have<br>failed to discharge his or her<br>obligations the commissioner has no<br>obligation to meet any objective test on<br>when to engage this power applied<br>literally the Commissioner or an<br>authorized officer put into any business<br>premises at any hour of the day or night<br>because all business premises will<br>surely contain information that's<br>necessary or relevant to the<br>commissioners obligation to assess tax<br>liability on the other hand section 21<br>of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act<br>states that everyone has the right to be<br>secure against unreasonable search or<br>seizure whether of the person property<br>correspondence or otherwise section 16<br>sits in a somewhat uneasy relationship<br>with war but that is a matter for<br>another day but given the intrusive<br>nature of all search and seizure powers<br>and the potential for abuse and the<br>relationship with a Borah protected<br>wrote it's not surprising that there are<br>being reviews about the nature and the<br>extent and the controls over powers of<br>search and seizure when you see the law<br>Commission conducted an in-depth reviews<br>in 2002 in 2007 and have recently<br>revisited the issue the 2002 preliminary<br>paper on entry search and seizure<br>reviewed the scope and adequacy of<br>controls on all such powers that exist<br>in New Zealand and it then categorized<br>all these powers into two groups Group<br>one powers were called powers of routine<br>administrative inspection and group two<br>powers were those where an offence is<br>suspected from that simple<br>categorization the law commission went<br>on to develop appropriate principles to<br>constrain and supervise the use of these<br>parts<br>and their aim was to develop a nice set<br>of rules that ought to apply to every<br>such power consistently and the content<br>of those rules would depend on the<br>content on the category into which the<br>Power Cell seems very logical so the<br>proposed rules governing the entry onto<br>land by way of administrative inspection<br>included that the entry ought to be<br>during daylight the officer effecting<br>the entry ought to have some appropriate<br>identification and if the occupant<br>wasn't present<br>Buneary effort ought to be made to tell<br>the occupant including leaving a<br>conspicuous Russian note different rules<br>where somebody was an individual was<br>suspected of some sort of criminality<br>those rules required additional<br>protections so the report classified<br>this lovely power in Section 16 as<br>belonging to group 1a routine<br>administrative power without any overt<br>analysis the commissioners past were<br>categorized as concerning<br>routine administrative matters either<br>now there's no reason why the<br>Commissioner cannot use section 16 for<br>administrative purposes such as those<br>but it's clear from the commissioners<br>our own operational statements but<br>that's not the predominant use she makes<br>the section 16 the commissioner also has<br>a power to require information to be<br>disclosed and that's the one that is<br>used most frequently and routinely<br>indeed it's perhaps not surprising that<br>the occasions when section 16 search and<br>seizure power is used isn't what the<br>commissioner considers the more serious<br>situations the specific examples that<br>she describes are where there is a<br>history or risk of non-compliance and or<br>lack of cooperation witness is likely<br>that documents might be at risk or<br>whether it's likely that the case<br>involves revenue revenue offending tax<br>crimes including fraud and invasion she<br>considers also that the power might be<br>used to address problems of regressive<br>tax planning and tax avoidance now the<br>first three categories that she states<br>involve some sort of offense<br>aggressive tax planning and tax<br>avoidance and not illegal per se<br>although they may attract a penalty<br>that's been characterized by the Supreme<br>Court as penal but we could say that the<br>predominant use of section 16 would seem<br>to fall quite skill squarely within the<br>law enforcement function the law<br>Commission's 2002 report specifically<br>excluded the search and seizure power in<br>the tax administration eight from<br>category two to put it bluntly the power<br>was incorrectly categorized in reality<br>perhaps uniquely the commissioners power<br>of search and seizure falls into both<br>categories one control in a full-scale<br>survey of research and surveillance the<br>true nature of the commissioners Paris<br>was not considered now there's a lot to<br>ponder about section 16 and ponder at I<br>have and ponder it those who who are in<br>the balance takes class this evening is<br>not the time for that but I might be so<br>bold as to suggest that a major review<br>of all such powers and New Zealand<br>legislation was in fact an appropriate<br>term and my second example which is of a<br>slightly different formation is the<br>relationship between tax and trusts as<br>is well known to many in this room the<br>use of domestic tax by New Zealanders<br>has been seen for a number of years as a<br>cause of concern that concerns been<br>apparent in the courts especially in<br>relationship property cases and in an<br>academic writing 2002 the law commission<br>published report sort of obviously<br>titled some problems and the law of<br>trust in 2009 it embarked on a major<br>project on the law of trusts beginning<br>with an this newspaper and ending with a<br>draft trust Act in 2013 at the heart of<br>these concerns was the observation that<br>sick laws were essentially ignoring<br>trust law and continuing to treat<br>property as if it was still their own<br>the Law Commission stage in this in some<br>cases<br>signals were acting and I quote as a<br>principle would in an<br>agency now the Law Commission identified<br>quite clearly that income tax and<br>previously estate duties were a<br>significant reason why so many New<br>Zealanders were so fond of tax of trusts<br>having made that correct connection the<br>next step might have been to ponder the<br>consequences of their fact that the main<br>context in which people interact with<br>trusts as a tax context related to that<br>obviously the professional adviser<br>they're most likely to engage with in<br>the formulation and management of their<br>trusts would one thing be their tax<br>advisor might then many people think of<br>trust law and tax rules about trusts as<br>being synonymous if we had troubled that<br>New Zealand does appear to ignore trust<br>law that settlers treat trust property<br>as their own that many treated trust<br>relationship as if it were an agency<br>relationship<br>why should perhaps be a useful idea to<br>analyze the rules they encounter on a<br>regular an ongoing basis the rules they<br>encounter in practice and their advisers<br>work within a daily basis might perhaps<br>provide a clue to enriching our<br>understanding of how people act although<br>the law Commission report used tax law<br>when considering how to formulate some<br>particular look through provisions and<br>like to deal with the misuse of trusts<br>there appears to be little or no<br>engagement with uh substantial tax rules<br>about trusts<br>now the New Zealand treatment of trusts<br>for income tax purposes is very unusual<br>internationally it's described as a<br>sickly based regime because the taxation<br>of a trust turns on the residence of the<br>set law it has been said that New<br>Zealand rules operation on the principle<br>that the trustee is an agent for the<br>settler as a matter of economics rather<br>than law that is to say the trustees and<br>I quote carry out the functions with<br>respect to trust property that the<br>Sickler could do for themselves had<br>they're not transferred the assets<br>you'll also be relieved to know that<br>this is not the moment for an extensive<br>consideration of the intricacies of the<br>taxation of trusts however the general<br>point I want to make is that for good<br>tax policy reasons the tax rules about<br>trusts are predicated on economics<br>rather than trust law in other ways the<br>text rules appear inconsistent with the<br>salon the lying truth of trust law that<br>the shtetl settler settles the property<br>on trustees and goes off to the modern<br>equivalent of the Crusades for example<br>the Income Tax Act 2007 makes it<br>explicit that the settler is liable and<br>I quote from the Act<br>it's an agent of the trustee for income<br>tax payable by the trustee further in<br>relation to certain provisions in and by<br>making gains from land transactions<br>subject to income tax settlers are<br>associated persons of the trustees of a<br>trust they settle and then the<br>beneficiaries of a trust they settle to<br>put it an unacceptably simple language<br>settlers have an ongoing resonance in<br>tax trust laws the concept of agency is<br>overtly embraced in the tax rules on<br>trusts now I or not to be taken as<br>thinking that such an analysis would<br>have been certain to give the law<br>commission the answer to the question<br>that set out to consider but I do think<br>that ignoring text trust rules left a<br>fertile avenue of analysis and explored<br>by mine these two examples that I've<br>given tonight suggest that treating tax<br>is law but not as we know it leaving it<br>disconnected from the rest of law is<br>best unfortunately it's unfortunate for<br>tax law and I think in some instances<br>it's unfortunate for other areas of the<br>law as well as been my ambition as a<br>teacher and as a researcher to open<br>those connections between checks and the<br>rest of law that's - that pursuit I will<br>now return and that is tax Commerce<br>history and law perhaps this has been<br>the map of my academic journey after all<br>Tinoco sohcahtoa my name is Tony<br>Valentine and as PVC humanities is my<br>great pleasure to deliver a vote of<br>thanks to Shelly<br>she's offered an excellent lecture I<br>think providing rich insights into the<br>development of her field of work and<br>taking us on a journey now she said at<br>the outset that journey was not the<br>story of our own research development<br>but rather the journey of tax as a law<br>subject a subject of both research and<br>teaching she has taken us on that<br>journey exploring what she called the<br>apparent oddity of Texas status and the<br>way in which has been often imagined not<br>really as a part of law<br>she has noted that text has really been<br>seen as a domain of the Chartered<br>Accountants there's a territory that<br>lawyers have been hesitant to explore in<br>to think about this is something that<br>she is pressed evented against in the<br>lecture arguing for the need to rethink<br>the isolation of tax law under learning<br>both the benefits that might come to the<br>taxation system after were stronger<br>links between tax and legal scholarship<br>and the strengths they might come to<br>legal system through a reconnection but<br>the kind of reconnection that Shelly has<br>advocated and these are really important<br>questions early on and her lecture show<br>you offered us a quote from Sir Arthur<br>Richardson which stressed the importance<br>of taxation because it sits at the<br>intersection of accounting economic life<br>administration and the operation of law<br>and a similar vein Shelley's lecture has<br>reminded us that thinking about tax<br>requires us to draw upon insights from a<br>range of disciplines in addition to law<br>history philosophy political science and<br>accounting she itemized so despite her<br>protest stations to the country there<br>has been very clear elements of the<br>journey in this lecture<br>the story of her own return to her LLB a<br>new entry into working here in the<br>faculty observations of an early warning<br>from a music teacher the importance of<br>the work of Phillip Baker and<br>degenerative nature of a comment or<br>exchange was over Richardson I think<br>that has really illuminated the history<br>of our university to speak about the<br>history of teaching law and tax and law<br>sorry in Otago and the place of tax with<br>unlegal education more broadly and that<br>of course has been a key context for a<br>homework and as she acknowledged at the<br>end of a lecture and plus it within<br>Chile's talk were there any local<br>perspectives that she is drawn upon from<br>history accounting and law itself a<br>scholarly toolkit that she has assembled<br>across the arc of our own professional<br>and academic life so I think Shelley has<br>done a terrific job in making a<br>compelling case for the pedagogical and<br>to literal and legal significance of<br>thinking about Texas law I think she has<br>been so successful that she will have<br>convinced almost all of you to agree<br>with her belief that tax is quote<br>endlessly fascinating so there we go<br>a clear assertion thank you all for<br>coming and thank you all for being part<br>of the celebration of Shelly's promotion<br>becoming mr. Griffis which is tremendous<br>please join the academic party for some<br>refreshments across in similar room five<br>on the other side of the corridor but<br>could we end please by joining me and<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
