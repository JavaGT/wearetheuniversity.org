professor<br>Marshall Chun from the University of<br>Chicago to you all today if you've not<br>already had the chance of meeting<br>Marshall I first met Marshall back in<br>2010 when I was having some<br>conversations about possibly going to<br>the University of Chicago for a Harkness<br>fellowship and health care policy and<br>practice and that ended up happening and<br>if any of you are thinking of doing one<br>of those fellowships I heartily<br>recommend you're getting in contact with<br>Marshall and has his wonderful team at<br>the University of Chicago so it's it's<br>wonderful to have had you here honor<br>William Evans visiting fellowship at<br>preventive and social medicine and<br>Marshall arrived in July and is with us<br>just for another couple of weeks now but<br>if I could just say a little bit about<br>Marshall Seavey and I've apologized for<br>having to write notes because his CV is<br>so comprehensive but Marshall studied<br>medicine at the University of California<br>and San Francisco and then went on to do<br>his residency and fellowship in general<br>internal medicine at Harvard where he<br>also studied for an mph master in public<br>health he is now based at the University<br>of Chicago where he's the Richard<br>perello family chair and healthcare<br>efforts and as president of the Society<br>of general internal medicine director of<br>the Chicago Center for diabetes<br>translation research director of the<br>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation finding<br>answers to health disparities program<br>sits on the Centers for Disease Control<br>community Preventive task force and<br>co-chairs the National Quality forum<br>disparities committee<br>Marshall has got over 150 peer-reviewed<br>publications with many many other<br>reports and other outputs so now it's<br>wonderful to have you giving us this<br>talk today titled what does equitable<br>healthcare in a just society look like<br>healthcare reform in the US and New<br>you<br>you<br>you<br>thank you and so Sarah and Rachel smush<br>to me and this is fun that Sarah I was<br>mentor when she was in Chicago and now<br>Sarah is my mentor as I've learned about<br>the New Zealand system here here in<br>Dunedin a Sarah had a great project she<br>was looking at looking at safety net<br>clinics in the US and integration of<br>care and she did her field worked in the<br>western part of the US this is Colorado<br>where one of sites was in Syria with<br>American cows yeah and so three<br>objectives for today's talk first is to<br>discuss what's required to achieve<br>health equity in a pluralistic society<br>second understand the rules of culture<br>values in the political process<br>and then third to learn key policies and<br>interventions to achieve equity and I'm<br>gonna take in a whirlwind tour that's<br>gonna really sort of bring together a<br>whole lot of different fields here that<br>I'll start with a little bit about my<br>personal background share patient story<br>talk about health policy and ethical<br>frameworks to find equity talk a little<br>bit about the mythology of the US and<br>the health care system there I'll spend<br>a fair amount time talking with the<br>battle over US health care reform what's<br>happening in newspapers today when you<br>read about a US health care reform I'll<br>then talk about what we know about<br>reducing disparities so-called roadmap<br>to reduce disparities I'll end with<br>lessons for both the US and New Zealand<br>as well as a little bit of C in<br>leadership so personal background so I'm<br>actually living in Iran at college and<br>it's actually been a great living there<br>and getting to know the students I live<br>this is a guest room to walk up at first<br>flight of stairs there that's that's<br>Braille I've been living over the past<br>two months and the warden of Arana<br>colleges the man on the left there named<br>GMA Gilbertson and so that's the first<br>day I was there he told me it's a<br>cultural thing in New Zealand for<br>speaker that start off by telling you a<br>little bit about their background and in<br>the u.s. the word Wharton means the head<br>of the prison<br>so as the naive foreigner I figured I<br>better do what he says<br>so this is a precious picture of my<br>family it's my dad when he was three<br>years old with his mother and it's<br>precious because it's the only picture<br>that exists of both of them together<br>that she died when he was three years<br>old some ways my family asked the<br>traditional classic Chinese immigration<br>story for the 20th century where they<br>came from my grandparents they come from<br>southern China for economic reasons and<br>both families ended up in Boston on the<br>east coast of the country and the 1920's<br>1930's these weren't particularly good<br>times to be Chinese in America a lot of<br>anteed Chinese discrimination laws anti<br>immigration and a lot of glass ceiling<br>and so my grandparents ended up in<br>Chinatown in Boston and the two parts<br>the family my mom saw it was noodles<br>we're in the basement of their home they<br>had a machine that made noodles for the<br>Russians in Chinatown and my dad saw the<br>family was laundry and so my parents<br>wedding picture and left to write this<br>uncle<br>Winthrop my father's father Uncle Roger<br>uncle George and uncle Gilbert they all<br>worked in laundries in Chinatown these<br>were smart parking people but they had<br>glass ceilings so it's sort of stuck<br>with me it's my favorite picture of a<br>Chinese Laundry in situ is a southern<br>Chinese painter who specializes in the<br>American West so you see the dignity and<br>the hard work there the 19th century<br>there were these things called Victorian<br>trading cards which were the equivalent<br>of advertisements for that era so you<br>see how the Chinese Laundry was<br>presented to that era the caricatures<br>some had a straight xenophobic theme so<br>the Chinese must go so you see the<br>Chinese laundryman pulling the money<br>going back to China and a lot of<br>different groups face to discrimination<br>so American Indians African Americans<br>Irish very poorly portrayed and so a lot<br>this is 114 years ago as my dad then and<br>there when my son was born and that's my<br>son a little bit further on that<br>Chicago's burgeoning City I'll talk a<br>little bit about it in terms of it's a<br>third wide third african-american a<br>third Latino 5% Asian and so they're<br>parallel soccer league<br>since my son place was Anglo as well as<br>Latino leagues he's in the far left in<br>front of coach Carmelo and this is a<br>couple weeks before I came to New<br>Zealand so while growing up there assess<br>my background in that shell so I'm<br>strapped in case that I'm a general<br>internist since I see patients both from<br>the outpatient setting as well as in the<br>hospital and I spent about a month in<br>the hospital with the medical students<br>and the residents and interns so last<br>year when I was in the hospital during<br>my month there were four<br>african-american men with diabetes who<br>are presented with foot ulcers that were<br>all far enough advanced that they<br>required amputation and this is an<br>entirely preventable event at this good<br>control of the blood pressure the the<br>sugar and the cholesterol or the early<br>treatment of infections this should not<br>happen and so you wonder well why<br>they're for african-american men coming<br>to the hospital is preventable problem<br>he said well miss allows the outpatient<br>care I have to admit that one of the<br>four patients was my personal patient<br>who had seen six weeks earlier coming<br>with a little bit of fashion giving<br>antibiotics set up then home nurse visit<br>with podiatrists follow-up me things for<br>cracks six weeks later he's a minute<br>requires amputation so quite<br>heartbreaking and sort of a<br>life-changing event for these four men<br>if we had longer period of time we take<br>a nice long list as a group here of what<br>led to these various disparities and<br>these preventable problems and we see<br>that there's a combination that of<br>medical factors and social factors so<br>how cost ethical frameworks you'll see<br>that throughout the talk will be talking<br>within the big three of healthcare<br>policy so how do policies affect access<br>to care quality of care and the cost of<br>care and the trade-offs among all three<br>in terms of ethical frameworks I'm gonna<br>give you a like for is busy frameworks<br>to sort of think about during the course<br>my talk one of the Tillett Arianism<br>where the goal is to maximize utility or<br>well-being or pleasure the idea of being<br>to produce the most good some have<br>described it as producing the greatest<br>good it's the greatest number really<br>with emphasis upon consequences so you<br>don't share too much high yet there but<br>the bottom one is did you do the<br>greatest good for the greatest number<br>liberalism which you have here and we<br>have here too in the US so you remember<br>like Beckham<br>Europe history and queen kings and<br>queens then the backlash against that<br>and the rise of constitutional<br>governments in the rest of the<br>individual so Liberty individualism<br>limited constitutional government<br>communitarianism which has some<br>parallels with the Maori concept of<br>final responsibilities individual of the<br>community and the social importance in<br>the family unit and then finally<br>distributive justice that the socially<br>just allocation of goods in a society<br>the greatest of the modern philosophers<br>in this era for this particular topic is<br>John Rawls who literally a giant<br>literally giant piece is a very tall man<br>and then a tremendous thinker so this<br>call here the principles of justice are<br>chosen behind a veil of ignorance and so<br>obviously has a spot experiment where he<br>says that if you were in a situation<br>where you did not know what your lot in<br>life was you didn't know if you're gonna<br>be more in a man or a woman white black<br>Latino Asian whether you're gonna be<br>rich<br>we're gonna be poor would have a strong<br>family or a broken family he says that<br>and that that preconception time you<br>just don't know your future that's the<br>time where you would come up with the<br>principles of how you would allocate<br>goods in society because you don't know<br>your lot in life you try come up with a<br>ferrous allocation of the resources you<br>remember Parliament David Clarke he met<br>him on the street and he referred me to<br>this book by an American historian David<br>Hackett Fischer who has spent a fair<br>amount of time in New Zealand it's<br>basically says that to oversimplify New<br>Zealanders tend to weigh fairness more<br>than Americans and Americans tend to<br>weigh freedom more than New Zealanders<br>oversimplification but probably overall<br>thesis is on target so equity system to<br>find that so in the World Health<br>Organization equity is the absence of<br>avoidable or immutable differences among<br>groups of people whether those groups<br>are defined socially economically<br>demographically or geographically this<br>is a sort of famous picture that people<br>use to distinguish the equality versus<br>equity quality means you get people the<br>exact same thing so you see that the<br>tall man's well the short man they all<br>get the same size stool even though the<br>tall man doesn't need it it's not tall<br>enough for the short man still<br>equity is people get the right size box<br>to be able to see in this case the<br>American baseball game so the tall man<br>doesn't need any box the middle sized<br>man is one box short guy needs two boxes<br>and this last slide sort of socks<br>buckling well the reality where this is<br>phrase in America about being born with<br>a silver spoon in your mouth it was the<br>phrase my George Bush the second George<br>Bush some people are born with all the<br>advantages to start off with some life<br>some people start 10 feet under the<br>ground for no fault of their own and<br>then some people talk about the idea of<br>liberation where if you remove the fence<br>so the structural barriers so example of<br>structural problems with our education<br>system or housing or whatnot we wouldn't<br>have these structural barriers by<br>preventing us from all having our<br>freedom in in the highest level point of<br>life so I went to Harvard College and<br>it's sort of like a pataga of a they<br>have a house system or a college system<br>where you spend that's three out of four<br>years I would lived in this house called<br>Lowell house and one of the best courses<br>I took was of course<br>Alysha course on American mythology so<br>much going to share with you a three<br>quick American myths I'm sure you have<br>them in New Zealand to your miss and the<br>Sharia the American ones but in some<br>ways sort of defined in the country so<br>first up so who's this it's well John<br>Wayne the cowboy so this idea of the<br>rugged individual that the frontier man<br>the guy who's free from the shackles of<br>government this one a lot of New<br>Zealanders don't know it's the<br>commercial tell your stories for the 30s<br>and 40s series of books based on the<br>same story all the time where some core<br>down on its luck kid then through his<br>hard work and perseverance ends up<br>succeeding and becoming rich and<br>powerful and famous so idea that well<br>you know if you if you just work hard<br>enough you'll be able to sort of<br>overcome all obstacles in fact if you if<br>you don't do well it's your own fault<br>you know that it's your flawed or you<br>know you're lazy it's your own fault so<br>keep that in mind that bad idea and then<br>third the melting pot so most of my<br>parents generation where the idea was<br>that well you know you may come from<br>different countries but you try to come<br>American they say the homogeneous you<br>know people say now we have much more<br>multi-ethnic sort of flavor in terms<br>people being<br>problematic averages but there was a<br>spare at 20s 30s 40s 50s where really<br>the goal was to basically assimilate so<br>the US healthcare system missin brief so<br>these are numbers from last year<br>insurance so we have it flipped in the<br>u.s. we're here in New Zealand you're<br>78% public insurance were flip so that<br>67% we have is mostly private insurance<br>and about a third insurance well how is<br>the Medicaid program so that's not<br>program for for poor people about 135<br>Americans and then even as of last year<br>almost 9% of our residents were<br>uninsured so huge numbers and then the<br>organization some similarities New<br>Zealand so we have a lot of small<br>independent physician practices<br>especially the rural suburban areas and<br>then we also have these large entities<br>these so-called managed care plans for<br>integrated care delivery systems so<br>groups of physician practices and<br>hospitals and organizations that then<br>bond together to provide care and to<br>help do with the financing one example<br>of Finance is capitation and so getting<br>a set amount of money upfront and then<br>you then figure out how do you best<br>allocate that money right now and you<br>can hear coming out the policy probably<br>the biggest sort of the issue is a<br>payment and this issue of like what I<br>call two canoes passing the dark or in<br>this case two kayaks passing in the<br>swimming pool it's really a payment<br>systems we have two very different<br>systems which are passing each other<br>but are both in practice and we have<br>different sort of incentives so down on<br>a system now which is gradually going<br>down and prevalences fee-for-service<br>which like in New Zealand the incentive<br>is to pay for volume that so I I do I<br>see more patients I get more money I<br>learn more tests I get more money I do<br>more procedures I get more money so<br>pretty inefficient in terms of this is<br>sacrificing you to do more the phrase we<br>have interesting system is value-based<br>purchasing so supposed to incentivizing<br>paying for volume how do you incentivize<br>paying for quality and part of that<br>relate to this babies person is a shift<br>from fee-for-service payment to these<br>other ways of payment so called<br>alternative payment models to create<br>different consent is I'll give you one<br>example capitation or a global budget or<br>if you have a global budget all of a<br>sudden you're said it becomes trying to<br>be efficient<br>keeping people healthy because if they<br>come lemurs apartment become the<br>hospital that eats into your profit so<br>the challenge is that the hospital may<br>be half their patients might be<br>fee-for-service and half the<br>patients might be capitated and so what<br>is financially advantageous in one model<br>is not financially advantageous the<br>other model so it's this weird sort of a<br>sentence and conflicting messages being<br>sent<br>okay the battle over us health reform or<br>Trump care versus Obamacare<br>so let's gonna remind you that back in<br>the early 90s President Bill Clinton he<br>tried massive health care reform and<br>failed in a big way you might remember<br>that Hillary Clinton at the time first<br>lady she actually led the effort they<br>tried to it evidence and bring a lot of<br>experts come up with sort of a<br>complicated thousand-page scheme to<br>basically reform the whole system but it<br>didn't get anywhere an a she was shot<br>down very quickly in the Congress and so<br>there were four lessons that people took<br>from the failure that health care reform<br>one be where the power of a health<br>insurance industry and in pharmaceutical<br>companies they would have lost in terms<br>of health reform terms of money and so<br>they fought vigorously but picture in<br>the middle that's a very famous<br>advertisement on TV Harry Louise we're<br>supposed to be like average Americans<br>funded by the health insurance industry<br>and here Perry is reading that's the<br>Clinton health report and the core<br>something like louise under the new plan<br>this service that used to be covered by<br>the old good plan is no longer covered<br>and it's more expensive to and then<br>Louise shakes her head this is terrible<br>so anyway that was they all these<br>separate ads in propaganda that<br>basically was part of the reason why the<br>bill went down so very powerful<br>opponents<br>beware central planning by the second<br>branch so they turn into too much in<br>terms of like the president and his<br>immediate group is supposed to be<br>working more closely with the<br>legislature the idea of like making sure<br>was bipartisan terms involving both<br>Democrats and Republicans and the<br>ninety-four mentalism that massive<br>reform is hard smaller change is<br>politically potentially easier or more<br>realistic so here's a picture from 2010<br>when President Obama's a sign against<br>the health care legislation become sort<br>of an iconic picture<br>in the States and so what the problems<br>was designed to fix so back in 2010<br>there were 48 million uninsured so ten<br>times your population were uninsured so<br>it's amazing very high premiums and so<br>this is issue that most the insurance<br>prime insurance is done through like<br>your group of oil employer so if you<br>work for the University for example you<br>have big negotiating power because the<br>university is a lot of employees they<br>have much more clout than if you as an<br>individual we're trying to buy insurance<br>on your own so if you were an individual<br>you had a hard time sort of getting<br>reasonable premiums and then also so<br>what happened to that is that there's a<br>lot of variation the quality of health<br>insurance you might be insurance but the<br>lower priced insurance was lousy or<br>Trump didn't covers much or helped much<br>financially and there was a legalized<br>outright discrimination termination sick<br>people with pre-existing conditions so<br>you know what to say well you have<br>diabetes I'm not gonna show you and it<br>was legal at the time or they could<br>basically just jack the rates up so you<br>get charged a lot more if your diabetes<br>or surestep we could say well what cut<br>me for everything except your diabetes<br>so you know really defeats the purpose<br>of insurance and I've talked much about<br>to access issues with the Affordable<br>Care Act although there were some<br>interesting quality and cost provisions<br>also so what did it do in terms of<br>insurance the President Obama's plan<br>well admission that Medicaid was the<br>insurance plan for poor people expanded<br>the number of people who were eligible<br>for it so basically then it raised it<br>from like about of 133 on four percent<br>of the federal poverty level to about<br>four hundred percent and so that you<br>could have learned more money and still<br>be eligible for Medicaid insurance the<br>other thing I did to encourage the<br>states to expand to Medicaid insurance<br>was that it said in the States<br>look though usually we pay about half<br>the cost of the Medicaid program and the<br>state's pay about half so there's no<br>expansion we will pay a nice federal<br>government 90 percent of the cost you<br>only have to pay 10 percent so it's a<br>massive financial incentive for states<br>to expand the ability of their citizens<br>for Medicaid this problem bullying<br>individuals did not have a negotiating<br>clout they create these so-called health<br>insurance exchanges then we're pools of<br>individuals can then be part of the<br>exchanges and so there's more<br>negotiating clout as well as the<br>government subsidize the cost of the<br>insurance premiums for many of those<br>patients there's a guaranteed health<br>benefit package so there were ten<br>essential benefits that all insurance<br>company<br>had to provide basic stuff like mental<br>health substance abuse preventive care<br>child care etc and before then<br>the wardens type of guarantee packages<br>it prevented it shows comes from<br>rejecting you for pre-existing<br>conditions so it wasn't that problem<br>saying well you have hypertension<br>therefore we won't insure you<br>and then also required everyone the<br>country to buy health insurance because<br>the way any insurance works is that it's<br>gotta be spreading of risk so basically<br>it turns out it's the young healthy<br>people who subsidize the cost of the old<br>people who tend to get more medical<br>problems<br>remember that slide about the help<br>considerations from the President<br>Clinton's experience nice so this is<br>essentially a Republican plan Mitt<br>Romney was the governor of the state of<br>Massachusetts he's a Republican this is<br>essentially the Romney plan especially a<br>Republican plan they basically could but<br>the buy-in of basically clinicians<br>hospitals drug companies insurance<br>companies because those would all<br>benefit from this but if you have more<br>people with good health insurance that<br>will cover for the cost of hospital care<br>clinic here will cover the cost of drugs<br>well who benefits all these big industry<br>providers first and Obama let Congress<br>have leading the formalization not about<br>the substitution of states and then<br>importantly it didn't try to blow up the<br>system that basic reserve the<br>predominant private marketplace private<br>health insurance scheme so you know<br>politically it made sense so we thought<br>the problem is that Obama care has<br>become what I call a political boogeyman<br>for Republicans meaning that it's the<br>per possession representation of<br>everything Democratic Democratic Party<br>everything especially with President<br>Obama let alone subliminal things like<br>how people view race and so the turnoff<br>than over time the debate we start to<br>get further further away from the merits<br>of health reform and just everything is<br>a representation of like the<br>partisanship regarding sort of<br>Republicans and Democrats and so it<br>became like part of platform and party<br>that you know we we have to busily<br>abolish Obamacare if we come into power<br>for us to the Trump on day one the Trump<br>administration we will ask Congress to<br>immediately deliver a full repeal of<br>Obamacare we're going to have insurance<br>for everybody Trump said there was a<br>philosophy in some circles that you<br>can't pay for it you don't get<br>that's not gonna happen with us people<br>covered in the law can expect to have<br>great health care you'll be in a much<br>simplified form much less expensive and<br>much better so my wife sent me this<br>picture which wish came out here to<br>visit the Chicago has a variety of<br>public art so this particular artist has<br>like five pieces of art they put in<br>different place in the city<br>this particular piece just happened to<br>be located in front of the Trump Tower<br>in Chicago so a very popular picture to<br>take so us system in the legislature<br>this the House and the Senate and what<br>happens is the house comes up with a<br>bill the Senate comes up the bill they<br>both pass it they then have to come<br>together and come up with a combined<br>bill that they both will vote upon they<br>pass that the dimension the president<br>signs it becomes law so the house side<br>I'm not gonna go into great detail they<br>they initially passed something called<br>the American Health Care Act which was<br>just it was so bad that I spire me to<br>write a blog piece called the<br>fundamental problem with the American<br>Health Care Act and I helped to advocate<br>in Bob Daugherty Americans positions he<br>blogged in 38 years advocating for<br>doctors and patients I've never seen a<br>bill that will do more harm to health<br>care than the American Health Care Act<br>being good on Thursday it will take<br>coverage from millions of the most<br>vulnerable the poor sick and old it will<br>raise premiums by thousands of dollars<br>so there's bad things the one story<br>that like to Caesarea mission mister<br>finish the term as the president of the<br>Society general medicine which is a<br>group of the major group for academic<br>general internists in the States and so<br>we have an annual hill day we go to<br>Washington and busy lobby and so we meet<br>Democrats Republicans liberals and<br>conservatives and so we met with a whole<br>variety of folks on that particular day<br>but the visit I want to tell you about<br>share with you is we met with the health<br>staffer for Senator to to me Pat Toomey<br>who's a very conservative Senator from<br>the state of Pennsylvania and usually<br>when you meet the the legislators River<br>staff it's a dialogue a two-way<br>discussion like a conversation that<br>you're having right this was the one<br>meeting where basically the staff a<br>person basically showed us for 20<br>minutes straight and the disturbing<br>thing was it had nothing to do with like<br>the merits of the health care reform<br>bill it had to do with like individual<br>rights getting government out people's<br>backs cutting government spending<br>so it's sort of a hot moment for me<br>maybe this was naive but I thought that<br>like you know you'd least be some<br>discussion of the merits of what it<br>means for people's health but it shows<br>like again they suddenly underlying<br>cultural values in the political process<br>and how something as ingrain is you know<br>that that John Wayne story and that<br>liberalism and all can be such a<br>powerful part of the way a country makes<br>its decisions so I'm gonna spend more<br>time with the Senate side this was the<br>more recent things you may have seen the<br>papers Mitch McConnell is the head of<br>the Republicans in the Senate and so<br>they created this bill with the oddly<br>named a better care reconciliation act<br>title and here are the main provisions<br>it would repeal the ACA insurance<br>mandate meaning that people wouldn't<br>have to buy insurance and it would<br>remove the government cost-sharing so<br>the government support terms to helping<br>pay for the premiums would go away<br>it would phase out all those different<br>activities to expand the size of the<br>Medicaid program for the poor it would<br>convert Medicaid him so-called Block<br>Grant where each state would get a set<br>amount of money at the beginning which<br>essentially me to cut in overall funds<br>it eliminate the provision requiring the<br>insurance companies to have essential<br>health benefit for lousy health<br>insurance so basically it helped you if<br>you were healthy and were high income it<br>hurt you if you were sick and low income<br>just pretty clear-cut the choice for<br>Mitch McConnell quickly is that he had a<br>very thin margin that there are forty<br>eight Democrats in the Senate and 52<br>Republicans if you assume that all 48<br>Democrats will vote no then and most<br>then the center can use two people if<br>it's a tie 50-50 then the vice president<br>is we hope again bridge the tie but if<br>he loses three votes then he can't ask<br>legislation so it challenges that you<br>can't miss person you can't make the<br>bill too conservative or lose the<br>moderates Kinley to moderate or she lose<br>conservatives the upper right is the<br>Suzy Collins who's a moderate Republican<br>senator from Maine upper left is Senator<br>Heller from Nevada which is a state that<br>went for Hillary Clinton in the election<br>so no previous mistake<br>autumn Wesson Senator Paul from Kentucky<br>who's a libertarian who busy wants to<br>eliminate government period and bottom<br>right that's a senator Lee from Utah was<br>a very conservative state so it's a<br>sense of the the the needle he had a<br>thread and they had a hard time coming<br>up with anything that would come close<br>to getting the votes he needed and and<br>the bills were bad in terms of like<br>they've been very similar to the house<br>bills mr. senator capito is a Republican<br>from the state of West Virginia it's a<br>very poor state I did not come to<br>Washington to hurt people with that in<br>mind I cannot vote to repeal Obamacare<br>without a replacement plan that dress is<br>my concerns and their needs in West<br>Virginians so I got to the point where<br>they couldn't agree upon anything so the<br>public's try the ultimate pass was<br>called the skinny bill which was there's<br>a cone down bill that was didn't want<br>actually come law but they want to miss<br>it passes so they would go to the next<br>stage and negotiations with the house to<br>come up with the next bill<br>the two main provisions of the top two<br>that they basically eliminated the the<br>the last thing you people had by<br>insurance then they would allow state<br>waivers so it gives people face ability<br>to do more different things and<br>basically have poor quality insurance<br>even the skinny bill failed send the<br>Collins vote against it senator<br>Murkowski from Alaska there's a a very<br>virile state Alaska and the rural states<br>would be really badly hurt by the<br>property plan and you may recognize the<br>bottom is Senator John McCain who was a<br>presidential candidate as four years ago<br>forty eight years ago and he's noticed<br>like one the more honourable senators in<br>the Senate so you may be the story that<br>he was actually uh in the Vietnam War he<br>was a Navy airman and he was shot down<br>and so he actually spent five years in a<br>Hanoi POWs camp and his father at the<br>time was a big-shot Admiral in the US<br>Navy and so for propaganda purposes the<br>North Vietnamese they actually said will<br>he go John McCain but John McCain face<br>with credit said I will not go unless<br>you release all my fellow POWs also so<br>he spent five years in the powa so what<br>he said when he voted no the Republican<br>plan offered no a placement to actually<br>reform our health care system and<br>deliver affordable quality health care<br>to our citizens and was now returning<br>the correct way of legislating is Senate<br>bill back<br>hold hearings receive input from both<br>sides of aisle she the recommendations<br>of nation's governors and produces a<br>bill that finally delivers affordable<br>health care for the American people we<br>must do the hard work our citizens<br>expected to us and deserve so it sounds<br>pretty basic what he put on that but I<br>have an iron slide but he's right I mean<br>this basic stuff has not been done<br>during the course of this debate in the<br>past had half a year on the Obama Shore<br>legislation so hope so right after the<br>vote President Trump tweeted three<br>Republicans and 48 Democrats left the<br>American people down as I said from<br>beginning little bamako implode then<br>deal watch so we don't know was going to<br>happen that is still very tenuous that<br>there could be an on election that's<br>Republicans take up more seats in the<br>Senate this could go through what they<br>most could want to have happen is there<br>to be fixes to the about through the<br>Obamacare act but we'll see<br>so another section of talk talking about<br>what do we know in terms of what works<br>for reducing disparities their advice<br>roadmaps to reduce disparities and yeah<br>then work with Sarah and others on this<br>paper<br>comparing the US and Zeeland approaches<br>to health equity and you look at the<br>national health stretchin languages both<br>countries have very nice documents<br>beautiful language and Zeeland was<br>actually probably well written but<br>actually there's a wonderful language<br>for equity you look at the Asheville<br>Statistics Health Statistics in both<br>countries and both countries do quite<br>poorly so then the action is mental<br>blocks of like actual policies the<br>actual implementation what's actually<br>going on there and here's where in many<br>ways both countries fall short so road<br>maps and so the challenge is that<br>there's no magic bullet for achieving<br>health equity<br>the problem isn't what challenges that<br>it requires a systematic process then it<br>really it's the process for an type of<br>organizational change like changing<br>behavior in a clinic or a hospital or a<br>health plan or a public health<br>department that there's gotta be a<br>awareness and partisan than achieving<br>equity so people have to care about it<br>and prioritize it there's never gonna<br>make a one-size-fits-all solution that<br>you got a tailor to your local context<br>to local population and local culture in<br>law school politics it's got the<br>iterative quality improvement process<br>that you never gonna get the solution<br>right the first time that you base to do<br>a following through in processes you<br>figure out one of the specific barriers<br>that you need to address in your<br>particular setting<br>solution you don't get it right the<br>first time redo it and improve it over<br>time so this iterative process but there<br>is a menu of evidence-based<br>interventions which is service starting<br>points for all those interventions and<br>any you see on the road map that the<br>recognized disparities making sure<br>they're important commit to doing them<br>the third one neither country does well<br>that making equity integral part of<br>quality that too often thing in both<br>countries you have your qual improving<br>people you have your people who think<br>about equity but they don't talk to one<br>another and so for a lot of<br>organizations they do like they're<br>they're usually equity event with a<br>community health fair and check mark<br>they've done their job as opposed to<br>thinking it every day and everything we<br>do train prime quality how do we make<br>sure that all of our patients all of our<br>populations do well designing<br>interventions implementing sustaining<br>I'll talk about sustaining in a moment a<br>little more some is common themes for<br>what works for improving equity conflict<br>tailored approaches work better than<br>one-size-fits-all approach is not<br>surprisingly team-based care many of<br>them like the the solo doctor type of<br>approach again not surprising involving<br>families community partners a lot of it<br>evidence of both countries who too many<br>health workers that can help bridge the<br>worlds of health care and in the<br>community and then this is the quest<br>slide that ultimately probably most<br>important is intrinsic motivation so<br>people's sense of doing things for the<br>right reason and then the vast majority<br>of clinicians as well as medical people<br>health care are trying to do things for<br>the right reasons and that's what needs<br>to be sort of emphasized but at the same<br>time even though most well many people<br>if the mind isn't line up in terms of<br>the business case can only do so much<br>and so there needs to be both the<br>financial support as well as incentives<br>ation of equity to make everything a lie<br>in terms of the strategic priorities the<br>problem of though is that when you start<br>looking at the individual access secure<br>quality of care Pam policies of both New<br>Zealand and the US there's vanishingly<br>little you can point to where the<br>policies were specifically designed to<br>lead to the outcome of reducing<br>disparities achieving equity and the<br>problem also is that again like these<br>generic general approaches like just<br>generally improve Nicole like here don't<br>necessarily lead to improving the<br>quality care and outcomes of the most<br>mobile populations<br>so kind of end now with the suitable<br>lessons for us and New Zealand sequence<br>this was actually the first day I<br>arrived in New Zealand so Sierra Mila<br>took me up north so when I came this<br>talk us in maybe the third or fourth<br>time I give it a New Zealand so far I've<br>learned that people under the age of 40<br>have no idea what I'm talking about<br>terms of The Ugly American and Marlon<br>Brando and so I've put in like the<br>second picture of like this picture here<br>of Ryan Lochte from the American swim<br>team 2012 Rio de Janeiro there's still<br>people a lot of people have don't recall<br>that<br>um saying liar liar speedo on fire he<br>keep behave badly you look that up<br>google it<br>so I'm a little bit leery about like s<br>as the Americans just been here two<br>months giving advice to you in terms of<br>your system but there goes this in terms<br>of a fresh perspective and see if it was<br>helpful<br>oh and I'm have to say no to that um<br>have I said that even just really this<br>morning Sarah actually said to me you<br>still so in some ways view the country<br>through rose-colored glasses I'm a fan<br>of country so anyway I think I remember<br>joint lessons for both countries having<br>this explicit focus on equity from oak<br>log here and paint and payment and I'll<br>give some stories doing a better job<br>integrating community and social<br>determinants of health and what I call<br>this issue of addressing culture values<br>and the other and so let me go through<br>these in more detail so an example it<br>wasn't me for example to have an<br>explicitly focused in quality care in<br>payment and so one things I do right now<br>is we're about to publish a report to<br>the people who run our Medicare program<br>that pays for care of older people what<br>you can do in terms of measuring quality<br>of care and performing the way you pay<br>for cure to lead equity and so basically<br>having people accountable in terms of<br>how they do with equity for a secured<br>performance measures<br>quality pure performance measures and<br>then develop measure for certain things<br>like you have a structures in place<br>agreed you have a culture of equity do<br>you have that what partnerships to lead<br>to equity that can help for calling<br>improving purposes and for payment you<br>think about things that<br>there's both upfront payments so if<br>you're gonna have developed fun<br>infrastructure for example care teams to<br>include CUNY holla burgers to prevent<br>problems from arising on the line well<br>who needs me payment up front for the<br>infrastructure that addresses social in<br>terms of health at the same time you<br>might use papal formers to devise<br>specific things that you'd have done<br>like mammography screening or and all<br>right now there's a big bowel cancer<br>program in the country<br>because either colonoscopies would be<br>under under done and whatnot community<br>of social terms of health so one of our<br>project we have in Chicago I mentioned<br>that we have this problem with diabetes<br>disparity Chicago and so where I live in<br>work South Side Chicago this majority<br>african-american working-class amazingly<br>you walk around South Side Chicago<br>literally one on every five people you<br>bump into has diabetes whether they know<br>it or not some diagnosed and if you have<br>diabetes and you live in one the<br>predominately african-american<br>neighborhoods of the city you have two<br>to five times the risk of having your<br>leg amputated and if you have diabetes<br>and you live in one of anomaly white<br>neighborhoods the city so huge disparity<br>issues in Chicago and we've had problems<br>their crime problem housing problems you<br>have lots of problems here too as<br>amazing this is a huge issue here so we<br>have housing problems also in the<br>state's poverty we've also great strains<br>so oftentimes people forget about the<br>great assets to the community in terms<br>of the the history of the community the<br>social cohesion the social networks and<br>all so we have this project improving<br>diabetes cure and and outcomes in the<br>South Side Chicago and I shared a few<br>slides were doing the community so we do<br>a lot of healthy eating type of things<br>and so for example clear was is the<br>social service agency that has a food<br>pantry where they give out free food<br>we've got the transform into a health<br>event so when my colleagues Monica peak<br>who she and I cut her at the program but<br>when the clients are waiting for the<br>food to be distributed we have devised<br>for two hours where we do things like<br>give health education talks the bottom<br>right those are students with a local<br>community college who are teaching<br>recipes for tailored recipes for the<br>food be given out we do programs with<br>farmers markets which give people access<br>to some of the food there and dollars<br>off coupons and whatnot<br>we teach about how to read food labels<br>in the actual grocery stores where our<br>patients shop save a lot it's a low cost<br>grocer in the south side and it's one of<br>our diabetes educators and teaching<br>about the food labels and whatnot we do<br>a lot of media so a lot of like Public<br>Radio's v-lin is the major Southside<br>Chicago african-american radio station<br>so a variety of things so here's one<br>that I think is it's a tough topic but<br>I'm gonna raise it because I mean it's<br>an important one what I call culture<br>values and the other so I talked about<br>how Chagas diverse the bottom slide of<br>some of our first-year Asian students<br>who have run a free clinic in the new<br>Chinatown<br>so Katie if you have sharp eyes you'd<br>recognize her wrists<br>she's the woman who was with Sarah and<br>those first couple pictures with the big<br>cows so a month ago she have a talk at<br>Academy Health which is a major<br>international health services research<br>conferences she gave a talk ins and<br>tunnels shared decision-making for<br>chronic conditions experiences of LGBTQ<br>african-american patients and the theme<br>of this particular session was<br>patient-centered communication patient<br>care she had a whole bunch of slides<br>that Miss Lee have very vivid quotes<br>that basic try to convey the experience<br>of these particular patients he's too<br>old minority patients so for example<br>when I used to identify as a black male<br>there was this idea that I was dangerous<br>right<br>it's what a walk in and I had a white<br>nurse practitioner their body language<br>would change I don't work and I am a<br>lesbian sign so you don't see that but I<br>do worthy I am black sign it's almost a<br>spree conception that I am going to be<br>somehow less of a patient so she had<br>like seven or eight slides that had like<br>these very powerful quotations showing<br>you I guess the experience but they<br>became cleared they're in question<br>answers that the audience who were<br>largely composed of international<br>international experts and patient<br>centered care communication just didn't<br>quite get it give an example at the<br>moderator of a session so the person up<br>at the podium and just moderating so<br>it's a national expert she asked this<br>question something like so how does I<br>don't get it I mean so how's this differ<br>from sin general cultural thomassie or<br>just in general doing good communication<br>or just general patient-centered care so<br>this idea like what is it about like<br>being a racial minority and LGBTQ<br>you know maybe she got it intellectually<br>but just didn't sort of register and<br>I'll give that New Zealand example word<br>so maybe the same thing so I've been<br>immersed myself in your culture and so<br>they come I was reading the Treaty of<br>Waitangi and about a couple like<br>documentaries on the internet so someone<br>from Jim Bulger former Prime Minister's<br>1993 how do we make this founding<br>document work for New Zealand it really<br>has to work for both of us Maori and<br>non-maori not to have it as something<br>that forces us to look back but really<br>forces us to look forward so on one hand<br>you might say well he's just trying to<br>be constructive that you know there's<br>nothing about the past this is move on<br>ahead on the other hand you might you<br>could also interpret it as either<br>devaluing the Maori to learners to pass<br>or not understanding the importance of<br>the experience in the past I I've worked<br>with a lot of racially I think minority<br>students in the US and living around a<br>college I've had a chance to speak to a<br>lot of students all different types of<br>students including Maori in tirana<br>college and I think one of most common<br>things that rich that the minority<br>students from both countries tell me is<br>that they say in general they love their<br>classmates they love that the white<br>classmates however the thing that the<br>white classmates have the hardest time<br>understanding is the effect of basically<br>the historical structural factors and<br>however time they've affected individual<br>behavior and individual situations in<br>other words if you have a segregated<br>housing system or a two-tier education<br>system how that has led them to<br>differences in the experience and where<br>things are now so it gets this issue of<br>like having honest discussions about<br>about racism about colonialism about<br>institutionalized discrimination the<br>u.s. we have an awful hard time talking<br>about it these are like taboo topics<br>that is just like crossing the third<br>rail I think to some extent assess that<br>here too it's a tough topic to have<br>really honest discussions about<br>at the beginning of this LGBT project<br>this is concept intersectionality so the<br>multiplied enemies and so originally<br>there's this definition that we used was<br>kind of a blender definition the<br>interconnected nature of social<br>categorization such as race<br>discrimination disadvantage there was<br>one member of the team as a bisexual<br>african-american guy do you want the<br>push from this definition was more<br>similar this ways in which systems of<br>oppression he racism sexism classicism<br>interconnect and cannot be fully<br>understood the examined isolation is<br>based upon work of an African feminist<br>named kimberlé crenshaw<br>I I didn't quite get it began the<br>project three years later you know most<br>of our project involves like always<br>qualitative interviews understanding the<br>individuals fears of people I have a<br>much better sense of like where he's<br>coming from and I think that sort of<br>moans get is getting at McKay's<br>experience and Academy health and why<br>that international expert on<br>communication and patience Ernest didn't<br>just didn't quite get it<br>lessons for the US so here again the<br>rose-colored glasses here<br>this is phrasing this world culture eats<br>strategy for breakfast or lunch so<br>imports of values and I think that the<br>US has a lot to learn from you zealand<br>in terms of the balanced values we are<br>just so overweight in terms of the<br>freedom from government liberty<br>individualism really at the expense of<br>human terrorism and semblance of<br>distributive justice<br>you have much more balance here in new<br>zealand was a great strength for the<br>country but you have health equity<br>issues here also what is your fees when<br>new zealand and you're a moderate-sized<br>country you're not huge you're not small<br>so even like the 200 months there I<br>ended up like speaking with your Prime<br>Minister for it for two minutes and<br>nothing there with me was my wife but<br>it's gonna find how it worked out and<br>then like my first second week here is<br>ran to David Clarke in the streets who'd<br>be like a public Minister of Health<br>Labour wins but I actually said to both<br>of them that you know you gotta spend<br>more time with health equity I've<br>actually started to record this like<br>anytime I can every newspaper in the<br>morning and I take a picture of like<br>when there's a delay story it's probably<br>like 15 delay story since I've been here<br>in the past two months and this is what<br>I've observers will look people took a<br>lot of people here in New Zealand here's<br>what people tell me<br>huge out-of-pocket costs the issue still<br>insufficient funding overall<br>health care system in the DHBs we have<br>articles do you really have a will and<br>sentence to meet the needs you may have<br>a nice aspirational language but the<br>fact that this various existence they do<br>really orientations that both the US as<br>well as New Zealand really don't make it<br>a priority Chima T we talk about<br>conflict avoidance and discussing racism<br>colonialism and this last one about the<br>balance of regulation in the free market<br>efficiencies and innovation so you know<br>I actually for you but well we know do<br>you a system has always problem so what<br>what can what can I bring for the u.s.<br>system that might help New Zealand I do<br>think that one things that we do better<br>in the US as a whole is that we have<br>more innovation and part of it was a<br>larger country and we have 50 states so<br>it's like 50 natural laboratories I<br>think part of it though also is that the<br>mix of how the government works with<br>philanthropy that works with academia<br>and works with the private sector and<br>the use of like collaborative approaches<br>and free-market proaches I think we have<br>it works out better I guess how all<br>these different parties interact to many<br>people I talked to you in the private<br>sector here say that the government has<br>not been the most efficiently organized<br>there is a facilitating innovation and<br>facilitating partnership again we have a<br>long way to go to States but I do think<br>that there's something here of like<br>something about the way the different<br>key actors work together is the mix in<br>the u.s. does lead to more innovation<br>and more of a mix of encouraging than<br>these creative solutions so it's<br>debatable but an observation so end with<br>us a quick blurb on advocacy and<br>leadership and so here's the this issue<br>that got probably like a lot of people<br>here would probably mostly hear people<br>here are sort of worked within the<br>systems people that a lot of academics<br>and rigorous research and all and and<br>work on trying to do evidence-based<br>approaches improving things but you know<br>is there a role for advocacy social<br>economy that two years ago it was the<br>height of the black lives movement in<br>the states where remember this was the<br>movement that protests for his brutality<br>where there were a series of<br>high-profile events comment<br>of police brutalizing african-americans<br>and so the one Chicago boys has been<br>notorious is a laQuan McDonald's sent in<br>your kid is this brutal video of a<br>police officer coming up to him and for<br>no reason just shooting him is fun um<br>all right murder and captured on video<br>and so Solly of the value of like they<br>visit protests in the streets and so<br>because the black lives matter movement<br>potential was promised issue Bruce<br>Valley and so what's been done in terms<br>of trying to do policies and the<br>community building to the issue so this<br>image for health care that we have<br>almost inequities that haven't changed<br>over time so is there a role for both<br>and I think there is well for both the<br>the working the system and the sort of<br>movement out see all right then Lou<br>Vanessa can break down ingrained<br>structural barriers and policies to<br>impede health equity or clinicians<br>health care organizations and advocates<br>build trusting relationships and resolve<br>conflict with mutual respect and honesty<br>that in some ways to that you can't have<br>an in-your-face type of conflict if<br>you're going to basically do the type of<br>change that is required that means<br>trusting relationships working with an<br>organization a hospital or clinic or<br>whatnot<br>fantastic or also we must combine<br>advocacy and relationship building to<br>end disparities achieving health equity<br>will require policy changes and<br>personalized critical care in<br>organizational transformation they're<br>dependent on goodwill and Trust under<br>this quote<br>become increasingly impressed by this is<br>the power that we as individuals have to<br>make a difference whether it's like<br>nationally to an election and you're<br>it's a very short time we have a big<br>election here in New Zealand and very<br>much the local level leisure matters are<br>all different levels solution matters<br>there's a professional responsibilities<br>clinicians administrators and policy<br>makers to improve the way we deliver<br>care to diverse patients we can do<br>better<br>thanks very much national time for one<br>or two questions that people have<br>question for so if you use its charge<br>for like well do you support Obamacare<br>well you might have a fair amount of the<br>the Republican base say well mama cure<br>well then we say things like well you<br>know it people have access to care that<br>was affordable and some underlying<br>principles within us personally then the<br>vast majority Americans want to have the<br>type of health reforms that do short<br>broad coverage and better support then<br>for for all Americans yes it's tricky<br>but then like what happens though is the<br>politicians tie into some of these other<br>mythologies other strands and some of<br>the base ideas that can drive publishing<br>behavior I don't think the issue so much<br>the market but more the underlying<br>societal values so remember that paljah<br>story about well there are there are<br>poor people<br>there's the good deserving poor and<br>there's the undeserving poor you know<br>that idea and oftentimes the undeserving<br>sort of Assoc was a boogeyman I'd like<br>to that a person of color and so you<br>know is nefarious in terms of the way<br>that some politicians basically sort of<br>try to draw those widgets in terms of<br>these other sort of like potential<br>divining aspects among a population so<br>it's not a civil rights issue but it's<br>sort of like a US versus them and the<br>deserving versus the undeserving yeah<br>it's a great question is one question<br>I've asked like a lot of people I meet<br>in New Zealand who work with trainees<br>it's like well how do you teach this in<br>the cultural constantly or disparities<br>and the most common answer people give<br>you in terms the most effective thing is<br>that the most powerful message is that<br>when students hear it from the actual<br>people so for example it's trying to<br>free - but train about like LGTBQ or<br>color<br>nothing's more powerful than hearing the<br>stories of Annelle ctq person the color<br>as opposed to me showing statistics or<br>or you know saying well here's<br>literature says when it gets down on<br>that human level because most people<br>still are no reasonable human beings<br>it's really hard to to argue against the<br>human experience and how things affect<br>the individual so when comes as opposed<br>to abstraction a real person in front of<br>you very powerful well this is in<br>general Tullius example like on its<br>promise in new zealand but typically<br>when there's a prince dishes for<br>congress and people try to mix evidence<br>and statistics with personal stories and<br>we'll bring it the parade a patience<br>with the personal
