font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we're coming so I'm gonna talk about<br>dogs citizen science and complex<br>behavioral genetics this is a really fun<br>kind of way to it's a really interesting<br>study just because it's something where<br>we're really relying on the fact that<br>people and dogs have a special<br>relationship and people love to talk<br>about their dogs and tell us all about<br>the special relationship I just want to<br>say I'm also really excited to be here<br>because my mother actually graduated<br>from the University of Otago back in<br>1966 he's right there before heading off<br>to the United States doing a PhD at the<br>University of Illinois and then marrying<br>a Swede and not really making it back<br>here but I did get to spend a lot of<br>time here growing up that's actually the<br>Noddy car up at Santa Cielo and I can<br>have Locke North me and my cousins I<br>also have this in my great-grandfather<br>and this is kind of my most notable tide<br>in New Zealand history is that this is<br>actually a guy called Albert Heyman who<br>started tip-top ice cream back in 1936<br>so but so now we're gonna go back into<br>the mists of genomic time which is more<br>like 2005 and so this is when we<br>finished sequencing the dog genome so we<br>sequence the genome of a dog named Tasha<br>and when we published the paper it's<br>always nice to work with this kind of<br>large charismatic macro fauna because<br>you get to have really cute covers on<br>your papers and we actually got Tasha<br>photoshopped into that famous photo of<br>Watson and Crick for the cover but I<br>just wanted because this is a public<br>lecture I just want to back up a little<br>bit and just kind of explain what I mean<br>by genomes I'm going to use this word a<br>lot so your genome is simply the DNA<br>that you inherit from your parents you<br>get one copy from your mother you get<br>one copy from your father and every cell<br>in your body carries a copy of that DNA<br>so you know when you only have so if<br>you're only at the one cell stage and<br>you've only got one copy of your genome<br>but in an adult animal you've got about<br>40 trillion cells I got that number off<br>of the internet so I'm not going to<br>stand by it if anybody has a better<br>number and every one of those cells<br>almost is gonna carry a copy of your<br>genome which is why we can get a blood<br>sample out of a dog or a person and<br>basically capture the DNA out of it and<br>sequence their genome and so when we did<br>the dog Genome Project we sequence the<br>genome of a single dog a dog named Tasha<br>and this is kind of a reference genome<br>so basically most dogs are gonna be<br>identical to Tasha so we start with kind<br>of laying down a reference map and then<br>we can look at other dogs and see how<br>they compare back to this kind of<br>reference genome and so we sequenced<br>Tasha<br>the female boxer her genome is 2.4<br>billion bases long so that says a C's GS<br>and T's and she has about 21,000 genes<br>and this is very similar to the human<br>genome which is about 3.1 billion bases<br>long and has about twenty twenty-one<br>thousand genes in it and so this is<br>essentially what we get out of the<br>genome project so long strings of a C's<br>GS and T's and the problem that we're<br>tackling now obviously is that we don't<br>actually really know what any of this<br>means and we kind of think about genomes<br>we think about genetics you think about<br>genes and it turns out if you actually<br>look at the genome of a mammal like dogs<br>or humans they've got you know billions<br>and billions of bases in their genome<br>only about 1.5 percent of that is<br>actually coding genes we think that<br>probably about 10% of it the sequence is<br>actually important and so it's actually<br>figuring out what changes in those<br>billions and billions and billions of<br>bases are actually doing anything at me<br>kind of organismal level and so as I<br>said a lot of its genes and genes aren't<br>the only things that matter especially<br>when you're talking about diseases and<br>traits it probably changes in regulatory<br>sequences changes in how those genes get<br>turned on and off as I said you have the<br>same genome in every single cell but<br>you've got heart cells and skin cells<br>and intestinal cells and cells as you<br>grow and the things that make those cell<br>types different from one another is how<br>that regulatory sequence is actually<br>regulating the genes and so the basic<br>questions that we're asking here is how<br>do we find the important parts of the<br>genome and how do we figure out what<br>those parts are doing and what changes<br>in them are doing and this is kind of<br>how we got back to dogs so dogs are a<br>fantastic model for studying this<br>because they have this really unusual<br>history so dogs were domesticated from<br>wolves the best available data as far as<br>I can tell right now suggests that dog<br>domestication was probably somewhere<br>between 15,000 and 40,000 years ago that<br>they there was either one or more than<br>one domestication event and that this<br>probably happened in Africa or Europe or<br>the Middle East or East Asia or Central<br>Asia<br>so still very up in the air question but<br>we do know that after domestication for<br>those 15,000 plus years since then<br>humans have been really dogs have both<br>been domesticating themselves in a sense<br>and then humans have probably been<br>breeding dogs for useful behaviors and<br>at the same time dogs are adapting to<br>live with humans and so they actually<br>shifted their food sources and there's<br>very good kind of I think there's<br>probably very good support for the idea<br>that domestication actually started with<br>dogs just eating wolves just eating<br>human garbage the ones that didn't run<br>away as quickly got more food and had<br>more offspring and that was kind of the<br>start and you actually see a lot of<br>changes and starts processing genes and<br>things like that and dogs compared to<br>wolves as well dog breeds which are a<br>lot of times what we focus on when we<br>think about dogs are actually very<br>recent so they're probably the vast<br>majority of dog breeds were created<br>within the last 100 to 200 years and<br>this is defining a breed as a<br>genetically isolated population we had<br>kind of dogs that were defined by<br>function before that but this idea that<br>you had a breed is a genetically closed<br>population is a very recent kind of idea<br>and so these populations are really<br>interesting genetically of course<br>because they have extremely limited<br>genetically genetic diversity<br>essentially all the dogs within a breed<br>or cousins of one another and they often<br>have very high rates of particular<br>diseases depending on whether various<br>mutations kind of got captured and went<br>to high rates within each population and<br>so what we're doing with dogs are<br>basically taking healthy dogs controls<br>and taking dogs that are have a disease<br>or trait and comparing them and just<br>trying to figure out where are they<br>different as a starting point for<br>finding the changes in the DNA once we<br>find the changes in the DNA that are<br>different between dogs that are sick<br>with something in dogs that are healthy<br>then we can start figuring out what<br>those changes are actually doing but the<br>real first step here is going from these<br>billions and billions of bases down to<br>this is actually the thing that's<br>changing your trait and then of course<br>as I said after that you have to go from<br>this correlation to causation which is<br>actually also really really hard but<br>that first step is kind of what I'm<br>going to focus on here initially and so<br>when we started doing dog genetics a<br>number of years ago we kind of started<br>with the easy traits and so we started<br>with one one of the ones we started with<br>was careless and the Chinese Crested so<br>this is a trait where if you get two<br>broken copies of this gene you actually<br>die in utero so you're never born if you<br>get one broken copy of the gene you're<br>hairless and if you'd normal than you<br>have this look very long furry coat and<br>so we did a genome-wide<br>in studies we basically looked across<br>the genome and every single in all the<br>dogs in our study and I think we had<br>probably put it on the previous slide<br>you know 820 hairless dogs and 20 coded<br>dogs that we were comparing we basically<br>went across the genome and at a number<br>of different positions about 20,000<br>across the genome we just looked and<br>measured how different the hairless dogs<br>were from the coded dogs you can see<br>that as we went across the genome we hit<br>this point on chromosome 17 dogs have 39<br>chromosomes which is why there's so many<br>different colors here when we hit this<br>point on chromosome 17 we have this big<br>peak and that's an indication that<br>that's the place in the genome where the<br>coded dogs and hairless dogs are really<br>different from one another it turns out<br>this was in a gene called Fox i3 when we<br>sequenced this gene it turns out this is<br>one of the cases where actually had a<br>change in the gene itself so if you<br>looked at the hairless dogs he saw that<br>they actually had a seven base<br>duplication in this gene this caused a<br>frame shift in the protein and basically<br>truncated the protein and it didn't work<br>anymore the thing I find it's really<br>cool about this is we went and looked at<br>two other populations where you see<br>hairless dogs the peruvian hairless and<br>the Mexican hairless these are kind of a<br>global thing I mean the Chinese Crested<br>have shown up in kind of Asia in that<br>area<br>pro-v and hairless in the Mexican<br>hairless or American dogs Central<br>American dogs what we saw is that all of<br>these dogs actually have exactly the<br>same seven base duplication that<br>indicates this was a single event it<br>looks like it happened a long time ago<br>it's sitting on a very short haplotype<br>in the genome and it seems to have kind<br>of been carried through all of these<br>populations over time which to me really<br>raises the question of why you would<br>keep these dogs around because the<br>hairless ones also have really bad teeth<br>so I've never actually figured that out<br>there's this theory out there that they<br>were easier to eat but I don't know if<br>that's true or not but anyway so he went<br>from hairless on to coat color in boxers<br>so we looked at this one mostly because<br>Tasha the dog we sequence was<br>heterozygous and back then sequencing<br>DNA was really expensive and really hard<br>so we knew that in the process of<br>sequencing Tasha we would have sequenced<br>both the normal version and the altered<br>version of whatever the causal variant<br>was for this gene because she was<br>heterozygous and so we we started by<br>taking nine to nine solid boxes she<br>boxers it didn't have any white ten<br>white boxers so these are boxers are at<br>home is entirely white and this is one<br>of the white coat color types where you<br>actually have a low rate of deafness<br>accompanies that so about two percent of<br>the white boxers are also deaf we did<br>the same thing a genome-wide Association<br>study we looked across the G<br>we got a really nice strong peak here on<br>chromosome 20 with a p-value of about<br>seven times ten to the minus ten which<br>is clearly even genome-wide significant<br>after you've done a gazillion tests and<br>we saw that this was sitting over a gene<br>called mid F and this actually made a<br>lot of sense it turns out that mid F is<br>a very it's quite a long gene it's got<br>multiple different isoforms of the gene<br>and if you start making your protein<br>here you make the a isoform and that's<br>needed for healthy eyes our dogs had<br>totally normal eyes but this form that<br>starts here at the m.i.c form is<br>actually needed for pigmentation and so<br>it actually made sense and it turns out<br>that when we combined our white boxers<br>and our white bull terriers to kind of<br>narrow down our region of association we<br>saw that it was hitting a hundred and<br>thousand bases of the genome or sitting<br>right here and it included this M start<br>form but when we looked into it it turns<br>out that we didn't have any coding<br>changes in this region so we didn't have<br>any changes that were actually altering<br>the gene itself but we did have a<br>hundred and twenty-four different<br>mutations that were around those coding<br>regions of the genome that could<br>potentially be regulatory mutations and<br>we actually managed to get this down to<br>two strong candidates based on we<br>basically did a bunch of things where we<br>sequenced you know wolves and breeds<br>where you never saw white coat color and<br>excluded any mutations that we saw in<br>those populations and we got it down to<br>two different changes there was a repeat<br>insertion a sign insertion about 200<br>bases upstream of this M start site and<br>then also a length polymorphism where<br>you went from 31 bases to 35 bases just<br>quite quite near to this M start site<br>and this was actually quite interesting<br>because that for base insertion actually<br>means that you're it's basically half a<br>turn of the DNA so if you actually have<br>cooperative binding between<br>transcription factors on the DNA turning<br>the DNA by half a turn might actually<br>disrupt the relationship between those<br>transcription factors and we know that a<br>whole bunch of different transcription<br>factors do bind in that region and since<br>then there's been follow-up work that<br>shows that these these mutations are in<br>fact functional but the thing I really<br>like about this is that it fits the<br>phenotype fits really nicely with the<br>idea that this is a regulatory mutation<br>so the M start side as I said it makes<br>it virt it makes a protein a version of<br>mid F that's needed for pigment cell<br>migration during development so when<br>you're developing your pigment cells<br>start on your neural crest and then they<br>migrate around and so if you have normal<br>pigment cell migration your pigment<br>cells migrate all the way around any<br>have color all over your body if you<br>have if you're heterozygous if you have<br>one normal copy and one copy that has<br>reduced expression<br>your pigment self only make it halfway<br>around and then you get like this<br>beautiful boxer puppy here you have a<br>white stomach and a solid back if you<br>have two copies that are altered you get<br>no pic nearly no pigment cell migration<br>however it turns out you have to have<br>pigment cells in your ears in order to<br>be able to hear and so the first place<br>the pigment cells go during migration is<br>into your ears and the vast majority of<br>even the white dogs will get pigment<br>cells in their ears which is why they<br>can hear except for those 2% that end up<br>being deaf the other thing is that you<br>will see that the white dogs when they<br>do have any pigment at all it'll be a<br>large patch of color on their head<br>because that's the first place the<br>pigment cells go during migration so<br>they basically have a very low level of<br>migration but they don't have enough to<br>actually cover their whole bodies the<br>other thing I really like this about<br>this is it really illustrates the power<br>of doing genetics and these natural<br>populations so people have studied mid F<br>extensively in the past and they've done<br>the thing where you kind of take the<br>break the gene or take the gene out of<br>mice and see what happens and they<br>figured out that if you really break MIT<br>F you end up with mice that are white<br>but they're also deaf they're blind and<br>they're mostly dead and so they figured<br>out what it did but on a kind of a very<br>coarse level in dogs because we wouldn't<br>have accepted a mutation that made them<br>deaf blind and dead we kind of have more<br>subtle things that we actually end up<br>starting to look for so dogs with mid F<br>regulatory mutations they're white but<br>they're rarely deaf they have normal<br>eyes and they're clearly other than that<br>perfectly healthy and so this was great<br>and we looked at a bunch of different<br>single gene traits in dogs these<br>Mendelian traits white coat color<br>hairlessness the ridge in the ridgeback<br>breeds ALS in the corgis bone<br>development disorder and we got pretty<br>good at this we're like we got these<br>kind of single gene traits down this is<br>going well and so we decided to move on<br>to something harder excuse me<br>so this is obsessive-compulsive disorder<br>in dogs anybody that's here that knows<br>anything about behavior will get annoyed<br>at me for calling it<br>obsessive-compulsive disorder<br>technically it's just canine compulsive<br>disorder because we don't know if<br>they're obsessing because they can't<br>talk so but I just call it OCD because<br>it's a great model for human OCD<br>basically OCD and people is defined as<br>doing an otherwise normal behavior so<br>much that it disrupts their quality of<br>life so the behavior differs in dogs<br>because it would be abnormal for a dog<br>to say wash their hands<br>but I tend to do things that are normal<br>for dogs so licking their paws snapping<br>at things in the air chewing on<br>themselves chasing shadows on the ground<br>any of these things would be totally<br>normal if you hung out with a dog for<br>five minutes you wouldn't know there was<br>anything wrong but if you live with the<br>dog then you know that they're doing<br>this for hours and hours a day it's<br>distressing and time-consuming the age<br>of onset is very similar between dogs<br>and humans and kind of early adolescence<br>for the more severe form it's highly<br>heritable in both people and in dogs and<br>they actually treat dogs and people with<br>the same types of drugs including<br>serotonin selective serotonin reuptake<br>inhibitors like prozac and they have<br>almost an identical response rate so<br>about 50% of people and 50% of dogs get<br>some kind of relief from these drugs so<br>not only is this very similar in the two<br>species it kind of illustrates the fact<br>that there really is a need for new ways<br>to treat this disease in both people and<br>dogs so we did the same thing we did a<br>genome-wide Association study of OCD in<br>the Doberman breed which seemed to have<br>a high rate of it we compared 92 cases<br>in 67 controls and got this really nice<br>peak over this gene CDH - which is a<br>neural CAD here in gene and this is a<br>neural cat here and it's found in the<br>synapses and it's involved in learning<br>and memory so it made sense that this<br>might be involved in an obsessive<br>compulsive disorder but it's also worth<br>mentioning that this only explained<br>about 7% of the heritability of this<br>disease even in the Doberman so we're<br>really only scraping the surface and we<br>also noticed that if we went back and<br>looked at the kind of genes that had<br>started coming out from the human genome<br>wide Association studies they didn't<br>have statistical power because in dogs<br>we had this kind of limited genetic<br>diversity that meant we could get away<br>with using 200 dogs in a genome-wide<br>Association study in humans and they<br>gotten up to about I think three or four<br>thousand people in their studies but<br>that wasn't enough for them to actually<br>get statistical significance yet but the<br>genes that are coming out of the top of<br>their lists are the ones that are<br>involved in glutamate signaling and do<br>seem to be the ones that are interacting<br>with CDH to CDH - so this is CDH - here<br>it's involved in anchoring the pre<br>synaptic in the postsynaptic membranes<br>and one of the genes that is coming out<br>at the top of the human gos is this DL<br>gap one which is actually sitting right<br>here in terms of this kind of post<br>synaptic density of proteins anchoring<br>that to the post synaptic membrane we<br>also saw and this is one of the<br>limitations of doing<br>study within a single dog breed is that<br>it turns out that there's another gene<br>CDH CTN and a2 which involved in<br>anchoring CDH to to the postsynaptic<br>membrane but actually in the Doberman<br>Pinscher breeds we didn't get any<br>association to this locus but it's the<br>largest region of fixation in that breed<br>that means that all Dobermans look<br>exactly the same in that position so we<br>can't see any differences between cases<br>and controls because there's no<br>difference in the breed but it might be<br>that the reason why we see such high<br>rates of this disease in the Doberman<br>breed would may be that all Dobermans<br>are actually carrying a risk factor<br>putting them at a higher likelihood of<br>getting it to begin with<br>and so this is both it's kind of an<br>interesting observation there may be<br>artificial selection involved it's very<br>hard to tell whether something is<br>artificial selection or just random<br>fixation because dog breeds are inbred<br>but it also kind of shows that just<br>looking within a single breed there's<br>gonna be stuff you just can't see and so<br>we actually went ahead then and we kind<br>of went back to our old data we used the<br>fancy new algorithm we found a bunch<br>more suggestive peeks of interest in the<br>Doberman breed and we actually did a<br>whole genome sequence not whole genome<br>sorry we did sequencing of those regions<br>targeted sequencing of those regions and<br>additional dogs and so we targeted about<br>four megabases of the genome sorry five<br>megabases of the genome for sequencing<br>and we totally sequenced the regions in<br>that four Doberman cases and four<br>Doberman controls too close to four the<br>German Shepherds and one plus one for<br>the for the the other two breeds that we<br>looked at the Jack Russell Terrier and<br>the Shetland Sheepdog and so this is in<br>contrast so when we do the genome-wide<br>Association study I didn't really get<br>into the details but rather than looking<br>at sequencing the genome rather than<br>looking at every single base we look at<br>markers across the genome so we kind of<br>look at maybe 20,000 50,000 markers<br>across the genome and here we're<br>actually looking at every single base<br>and the power of that is we can actually<br>find the causal mutation and so we did<br>that we got lots and lots of candidate<br>mutations which is what makes this<br>really hard about 30,000 different<br>variants that we were looking at but we<br>did see some interesting things coming<br>out so if you look at all of the bases<br>that we studied we see no difference<br>between the dogs the affected dogs and<br>the healthy dogs in terms of how many<br>variants how many genetic variants we<br>see in each dog but if we look at things<br>that we think might be functional so<br>coding and conserved parts of the genome<br>so conserved are things that are<br>identical across many species and the<br>reason why something might be kept<br>identical across many different species<br>as it is due<br>something important because genomes<br>randomly mutate with time and so<br>something's conserved you might think<br>it's important what we saw is not only<br>do we see a difference once we look at<br>coding and conserved regions but this<br>region this actually gets even stronger<br>when we look just at the conserved basis<br>which kind of suggests that the<br>regulatory sequences might be really<br>important in terms of what what's<br>actually underlying this we also saw we<br>actually found two candidate variants as<br>being causal for this and this was<br>actually really interesting so we went<br>through and we didn't find any variants<br>that we saw multiple cases in coding<br>regions but we saw one variant in three<br>different doberman cases that we saw<br>only in the cases in those doberman<br>cases in a regulatory region and<br>actually when we took a closer it looks<br>look it turns out it's a very small<br>regulatory region and it's actually one<br>of these h3k27 methylation regions so<br>it's a regulatory region what we saw is<br>we actually have two mutations so three<br>out of our four doberman cases have this<br>change in a highly conserved base so<br>this is highly constrained to a T across<br>mammals and in our cases we see an a but<br>the fourth doberman case that we looked<br>at actually has a different mutation<br>disrupting exactly the same regulatory<br>element down here so you see a highly<br>conserved a shifted to a G and we went<br>and looked at it it turns out that we<br>did an M so which is basically a way of<br>looking at whether whether proteins are<br>binding to a region in the genome and so<br>what we could see is that if we looked<br>at our wild type the normal version of<br>this for one of our mutations we could<br>see stuff binding to that region and<br>when we looked at the mutated version<br>that bindings disappeared suggesting<br>that transcription factor binding might<br>actually have been disrupted by this<br>mutation we didn't see anything for the<br>other mutation but we do see when we use<br>a luciferase assays so this is basically<br>looking at whether expression so if it's<br>a regulatory sequence it's controlling<br>the expression of things nearby and so<br>we put a reporter gene nearby to see<br>whether the expression of that reporter<br>gene changed depending on which version<br>of the sequence was just next to it and<br>what we saw is that compared to the what<br>here's if we don't have any sequence<br>next to it so that's kind of like<br>background and so if you have the<br>wild-type version it goes down so<br>apparently the wild-type version of the<br>sequence access our repressor it it<br>turns down gene expression and our two<br>mutations do actually have an effect but<br>in opposite directions so one of them<br>the second one the one that we saw in<br>one doberman case actually shifts it up<br>relative to the wild-type and the other<br>one actually should<br>down relative to the wild type so<br>they're both functional that's the good<br>news they're both doing something but<br>there's clearly kind of a complicated<br>picture going on here that we haven't<br>really untangled yet the other thing is<br>if we looked at which genes had the most<br>changes in the cases we saw that they're<br>all genes that have brain functions so C<br>D h2 is one of the ones that came out<br>that was the one that we originally<br>found in the Dobermans we see it in the<br>other breeds as well see tienen a2 that<br>was the one that was fixed in the<br>Dobermans we actually see that in the<br>other breeds we do see differences<br>between the cases and the controls in<br>that gene another one is a Texan one<br>which has been linked to autism which<br>has a compulsive disorder component in<br>humans and then there's this gene that<br>nobody's actually really knows what it's<br>doing but seems to be interesting and so<br>this was actually really cool and we're<br>like this is great but we work in a<br>place that studies human health and so<br>we have to tie this back to human OCD as<br>well and so we actually went back and we<br>took human cases and actually sequenced<br>them to see if we could see changes in<br>genes that were linked to OCD either<br>through dogs or through humans or<br>through studies in mice and we basically<br>looked at all of these regions and what<br>we saw is that the regions that we the<br>genes that are connected to OCD in dogs<br>this is slightly complicated but<br>basically what we saw is compared to all<br>the other genes in our study the four<br>genes and one of the mouse genes that<br>were connected to OCD in these kind of<br>mouse model systems do have more rare<br>variants in them in human cases and the<br>reason this is interesting is that it's<br>consistent with the idea that in humans<br>OCD is a bad thing<br>it's going to affect your ability to<br>reproduce so you're not going to have<br>common mutations necessarily because<br>mutations these mutations are causing<br>OCD you're gonna want to get them out of<br>your population and so it might be that<br>you have mutations in these genes and<br>dogs because selection is relaxed in<br>these kind of weird artificial<br>populations in humans you see an<br>enrichment for rare mutations but these<br>never become common mutations because<br>they're causing where they're at least<br>increasing your risk of having OCD and<br>this is kind of more suggestive and<br>something we really need to follow up on<br>but it's kind of the pattern that we<br>would expect to see given what we know<br>about dog population history and human<br>population history we also did find a<br>number of genes where we saw both a<br>burden of coding variants one of the<br>ones that came out as being genome-wide<br>significant is actually this nerection<br>one gene which we're quite excited about<br>because I don't think there's actually<br>than many other if any other genes that<br>have been significantly connected to<br>associated with OCD and humans yet and<br>this actually is genome-wide significant<br>after we include a huge number of<br>controls through this X act resource<br>which is something that Dan MacArthur's<br>going to talk about I believe tomorrow<br>night and we also saw genes that had a<br>burden of regulatory variance which is<br>kind of also what we would expect to see<br>with this idea that some genes are not<br>going to have changes in coding regions<br>but in regulatory regions the other<br>thing that we saw and I find this to be<br>really interesting it took me a little<br>while to get my head around it but<br>basically when we went into this we were<br>kind of expecting so OCD and humans OCD<br>and dogs it looks the same we're going<br>to find the same genes and that was kind<br>of what we went in looking for and we<br>don't see that we're not seeing the same<br>genes necessarily coming up in human<br>patients is what we're seeing in dogs<br>with OCD but we are seeing are the same<br>pathways and in some ways I actually<br>think this might make it more powerful<br>in the sense that what we're trying to<br>do here is we're trying to figure out<br>what are the pathways in the brain that<br>are putting people at a higher risk of<br>obsessive-compulsive disorder well as we<br>found those pathways we may be able to<br>design new therapies that could actually<br>modulate those pathways turn them up or<br>turn them down without having these kind<br>of global effects on the brain which<br>causes the really debilitating side<br>effects that often come from the drugs<br>that we're using now and it looks like<br>by using multiple species in these kind<br>of analyses so by using humans so this<br>is a gene we found in our human studies<br>with this little human icon next to it<br>and the dog studies I've marked here<br>with a little dog head and then even<br>from the mouse studies of America the<br>little mouse head we're actually getting<br>a much richer kind of picture of what<br>the whole pathway is in the brain that's<br>actually underlying these compulsive<br>disorders and so this led me to the the<br>overwhelming and brilliant idea the<br>behavior is probably complex and<br>involves many genes one of my better<br>moments I know but sometimes it might be<br>simpler to study this in dogs and in<br>people and this comes down again to that<br>population history of dogs that I<br>mentioned so for 15,000 years dogs have<br>both been domesticated themselves and<br>adapting to our lifestyle and we've also<br>probably started breeding them for<br>behaviors that were useful to us and so<br>this was kind of very strong selection<br>on particular behaviors that we were<br>favoring and they're really the<br>interesting thing about positive<br>selection is positive selection Drive<br>variants that have a large effect so the<br>things that you actually change the<br>behavior of the dog you decide you want<br>that behavior around you select on it<br>and you make those you know you breed<br>those dogs they have more offspring so<br>it basically takes variants that are<br>gonna have a large effect on your<br>phenotype and drives them to being<br>highly prevalent in your population<br>it creates common variants of large<br>effect and the nice thing about common<br>variants of large effect is they're much<br>easier to genetically map than things<br>that are rare and debilitating and we do<br>actually see that some of the behavioral<br>selection in dogs may be connected to<br>psychiatric diseases so if you look at<br>breeds that seem to have be enriched for<br>a particular kind of working dog working<br>behaviors like herding or guarding or<br>protecting you actually see that these<br>populations also have increased rates of<br>psychiatric diseases like anxieties and<br>phobias and impulsive disorders and<br>things like that so it does seem to be a<br>connection that said and so this is a<br>study from a couple of years ago in<br>human populations and so this is they<br>finally got statistical significance for<br>a psychiatric disease study in human<br>populations and it's a beautiful study<br>and it's a wonderful kind of advance and<br>studying schizophrenia but in order to<br>get there they had to have 40,000 cases<br>and 110 115 thousand controls to get<br>statistical significance so even if it's<br>way easier in dogs than it is in people<br>we're still going to need a lot of dogs<br>and that was kind of the origin of this<br>whole citizen science project and we're<br>not focusing on just the purebred<br>populations here I got the numbers from<br>the US actually tried to find the number<br>in New Zealand this morning but I<br>couldn't find it but in the US there's<br>more than 70 million dogs and we looked<br>it up in a lab meeting a couple weeks<br>ago and discovered it is in fact more<br>dogs than people and children in the<br>United States the worldwide there's at<br>least 500 million and the vast majority<br>of these are not purebred there either<br>village dogs which have never been in<br>any through any kind of breed bottleneck<br>or they're mixed breed dogs and so we<br>basically introduced a study to go after<br>just pet dogs any pet dog can enroll for<br>the study we you can be purebred you can<br>be mixed breed we don't care we figure<br>we'll just deal with that in the<br>genetics of the you know once we have<br>the data and so this is basically the<br>idea you go to sign up in our website<br>you tell us all about your dog's<br>behavior and personality using the<br>questionnaires on our website and then<br>we mail you a kit to get a saliva sample<br>this has been a bit of the hurdle with<br>the international<br>can't make it out if you live in a<br>different country unfortunately which is<br>why the event this morning where we<br>actually got saliva samples from a bunch<br>of dogs in New Zealand is really cool<br>and so on our website you go there<br>there's a lot of short surveys<br>I really really hate endless internet<br>surveys and so we made sure that each<br>one was only ten questions long as you<br>at least feel like you're getting<br>somewhere and this is the first year of<br>the project we're now up at about 13,000<br>dogs who signed up the owners have<br>answered about 1.4 million questions for<br>us and we've got about 3,700 saliva<br>swabs that we've collected so far and I<br>think basically this is constrained by<br>how quickly we can really get the word<br>about about this project people seem to<br>be really excited about it and they<br>really like answering our questions and<br>talking about their dogs<br>we got samples from all the way across<br>the u.s. right now and these are the<br>kind of questions we ask so one of the<br>questions is you know does life enjoy<br>playing with toys full-disclosure leaf<br>is actually my cat I don't have a dog I<br>had to put something in there and then<br>we basically get the answers back so it<br>turns out that most of the dogs in our<br>dataset right now their owners either<br>strongly agree or agree that their dog<br>does in fact enjoy playing with toys<br>most of our dogs are very happy yeah<br>they're strongly or agree that your dog<br>enjoys life and this was a question that<br>my postdoc added in because they needed<br>a 10th question for a survey and I have<br>no idea what's gonna come out of it but<br>people get very worked up about it the<br>question is does your dog know that he<br>or she is a dog there actually seems to<br>be very split opinions about that fact<br>that question we asked you about some<br>basic morphological traits like white<br>fur and how long the fur is what is your<br>dog's ear shape how high are they in the<br>original version we tried mailing people<br>a measuring tape to get them to measure<br>their dog totally failed so now we just<br>ask how tall is your dog relative to you<br>seems to work much better we actually<br>asked about artificially selected<br>behavior so does your dog a retriever<br>does your dog point it's your dog seek<br>companionship from people those are the<br>behaviors that I think may be<br>particularly powerful genetically just<br>because of this idea that selection will<br>have driven common variants of you know<br>too high prevalence in these populations<br>we also ask about complex behavioral<br>traits and disorders there's a number<br>really well published that well-tested<br>surveys out there for getting it complex<br>behavioral traits in dogs that are<br>actually drawn directly from surveys<br>that they use for humans for things like<br>personality impulsivity and obsessive<br>compulsive disorder and you can see even<br>in our data set now we've got a really<br>nice tail where we've got dogs that are<br>very impulsive in dogs that seem to be<br>very not impulsive and so it'll be<br>really interesting to kind of compare<br>those two groups and then we actually<br>have this really fun set of questions we<br>sat down with a group of dog trainers so<br>these are people that spend a lot of<br>time working with dogs and dog owners<br>and I figured if anybody would know how<br>to talk to dog owners it would be these<br>people and I said we're looking for<br>traits that seem to have some genetic<br>component so I defined that as show some<br>evidence of segregating between breeds<br>that are easy for owners to identify and<br>that people aren't going to care about<br>they're not going to try to train their<br>dog to do it or train their dog to not<br>do it and we have this really<br>interesting set of traits it's things<br>like does your dog do that adorable head<br>tilt thing like it's asking a question<br>does your dog place their paws your foot<br>or other people's feet does your dog<br>cross their front paws when they sit<br>down I have no idea what we're gonna<br>find from this but because people are<br>willing to answer our questions I mean<br>once we have the genetic data we can go<br>back to these owners and ask some kind<br>of things over and over again if they're<br>if they're excited to engage with us and<br>then we've actually just added a series<br>because the bird Institute has this new<br>food allergy science initiative and so I<br>talked to them and we've actually just<br>added a new set of surveys related to<br>food allergy and food picky eating and<br>and digestive issues and all this kind<br>of stuff and I was really excited about<br>this because I didn't know if we added<br>new surveys if we could actually get<br>people to come back to the site but<br>within the first three weeks we had the<br>survey up I think we had over a thousand<br>people come back and fill in the surveys<br>for their dogs and they're still coming<br>so it does seem like we can actually get<br>people to return and this is how we get<br>this saliva samples this is an adorable<br>puppy getting a cheap swab they really<br>like this was a group of puppies we were<br>doing cheek swabs on repeatedly and so<br>they got really really excited about<br>getting cheek swabs it was like the<br>highlight of the day the hardest part<br>was getting only one puppy to get<br>swamped at a single time but these are<br>our kits they get mailed out their<br>postage paid this is the swab inside it<br>and then they mail it back to us and<br>they often actually include a photo with<br>it so it's started just sticking the<br>post those up on the wall of our office<br>and we can actually start looking we're<br>actually looking at collecting some<br>other phenotypes so we can get hair<br>cortisol from a hair sample so it's<br>basically a long-term measure of how<br>stressed the dog is we could also<br>actually look there's activity monitors<br>and things like that for dogs and so we<br>can actually start putting those on the<br>collars we've looked at just recently at<br>some what are called passive<br>environmental sensors so they're little<br>silicon things you can put on a collar<br>that made measures you know chemicals in<br>the environment and things like that and<br>then we also try to give the owners<br>feedback you know their dog's<br>personality based on their dog's<br>personality we give them activity<br>recommendations things or dogs but enjoy<br>or might not enjoy is a way to kind of<br>give them some information as they're<br>waiting for the genetics to come because<br>that's kind of the part that takes a lot<br>longer for us to do the other night only<br>nice thing about this is we get all the<br>dogs in so it's not just pure breads<br>it's not just rescues we really have a<br>nice distribution of the dog population<br>in the US and if you actually look at<br>the overall proportions of purebred<br>versus mixed we seem to be actually<br>getting very similar to what you<br>actually see in the the overall<br>population and so this is kind of the<br>last thing I'm going to really get into<br>but this is basically the initial<br>genetics that we've done so when we<br>started this project we realized that<br>nobody ever looked at mixed breed dogs<br>there are all of these assumptions about<br>what their genomes look like but nobody<br>really ever done a genome sequencing<br>study of a mixed breed dog and so we did<br>whole genome sequences on 21 mixed breed<br>dogs the criteria for getting into this<br>was basically that you had to have a dog<br>you had no idea what it was and you had<br>to run into me within this two-week<br>period when I was looking for dogs that<br>was basically it<br>and it possibly may include my sister's<br>dogs it's totally know yeah I really<br>wanted to find out what those dogs were<br>so you looked at these mixed free dogs<br>and they're actually really interesting<br>so in terms of their homeless overall<br>homozygosity they're much more like the<br>village dogs than they are like mixed<br>with Lisa mix breed here is like a<br>simple mix like one or two generations<br>mixed and these are purebred so they<br>have very little homozygosity in their<br>genome which is nice in terms of doing<br>these genetic Association studies<br>because we don't have to worry about<br>this whole fixed region problem that we<br>saw in the Dobermans where all the dogs<br>look the same and we also see if we<br>actually look at the size of the<br>homozygous regions that they're very<br>short so this means that there's been<br>quite a lot of generations of mixing so<br>the linkage disequilibrium is getting<br>mixed up and so we went ahead and did an<br>admixture analysis of these mutts to see<br>if we could figure out what breeds<br>they were this is really nice work done<br>by Linda that current and Jessie McClure<br>two postdocs in my group and we<br>basically took it says sixty different<br>dog breeds I think we're actually gonna<br>be able to get it up to a hundred<br>different dog breeds in the final<br>version of this we have 15 dogs per<br>breed and and this the results I'll show<br>you now we've got about 80% of the<br>American purebred dogs represented so<br>this is basically our reference data set<br>and what we're gonna do is go across the<br>genomes of the mutts and basically say<br>at each point<br>what breed does this region of the<br>genome match the closest where does this<br>ancestry come from and so the better<br>your reference data set is the better<br>you can actually make that match the<br>caveat on this is that for most of these<br>breeds because we're using data that<br>other people have published we only have<br>the Illumina array snip chip which means<br>we only have 170,000 positions in the<br>genome typed for most of these breeds<br>rather than our mutts where we actually<br>have the whole genome sequence done and<br>there's a major issue with ascertain<br>'men bias for anybody who knows who that<br>what that is<br>they chose these snips in order to look<br>at the differences between breeds and so<br>the hazard attainment bias on those<br>hundred and seventy thousand steps is<br>pretty strong but the way we did this is<br>we started with simulation so we<br>basically took purebred dogs and mixed<br>them together in a computer to create<br>mutts and then once we had mutts<br>we looked at how well we could actually<br>figure out what their ancestry was given<br>that we knew what the answer was and<br>this is basically the algorithm that<br>Linda developed where she did 20<br>generations of crosses simulated these<br>mutts and they came up with some<br>software using something called a<br>support vector machine it's a support<br>mix algorithm actually so it's been<br>published already to do the ancestry or<br>assignments and see how well we could<br>actually do at it and as you would<br>expect what we saw was that the longer<br>the haplotypes were so the longer the<br>blocks of ancestry were the better we<br>could actually match it up to a known<br>breed and once we were getting over<br>about about thirty megabases we started<br>to get pretty accurate as far as our<br>percent correct we're doing really well<br>with single breed dogs there's a chunk<br>of the genome and every dog that we<br>can't actually confidently assign<br>ancestry to and we're kind of still<br>figuring out why that is whether it's<br>the markers in those regions where<br>there's a lack of markers in those<br>regions whether it's just something to<br>do with ambiguity and our algorithm and<br>so we're still kind of looking into that<br>but you can see that our boots here<br>who's definitely a beagle<br>the only ancestry from a breed that we<br>assigned to him is beagle Shetland<br>Sheepdogs<br>and retriever and this Boston Terrier<br>has a few other breeds showing up but it<br>seems like bull terrier French Bulldog<br>in English bulldog which are similar in<br>some ways to the Boston Terrier dogs<br>that had 50% ancestry from a breed we<br>see that really nicely too so this is a<br>Labradoodle here named Hubbell and he's<br>half poodle and half golden retriever<br>and that's coming out really nicely and<br>then we get to our mutts and it turns<br>out that every single mutt that we chose<br>out of those initial 21 is a whole<br>beautiful constellation of breeds there<br>was not a single simple mix out of those<br>21 original dogs which really surprised<br>me given how kind of random my selection<br>was it was just if you didn't know what<br>your dog was so this is Schuyler and<br>when Linda adopted Schuyler in<br>California she was told that Schuyler<br>was a Labrador pit bull mix by the<br>shelter and we're still working on the<br>the breed ancestry but this is the one<br>where we had the ad reference breeds and<br>we basically got Labrador does show up<br>that's the purple slice here there's<br>some bull terrier which might be pit<br>bull but it's coming in pretty low down<br>around here in the top breeds are<br>Dalmatian Rottweiler and golden<br>retriever and so it really seems like<br>it's very hard to look at these mutts<br>and actually figure out what's in them<br>this is sandy this is another one of our<br>mutts this belongs to Angela who's an<br>Australian is she made me promise to<br>make sure I put her dog in my talk but<br>this is sandy sandy there's a huge chunk<br>of the genome that we can't assign to<br>anything as I said we're still trying to<br>figure out what that is I suspect a lot<br>of it is once you've got many<br>generations of mixing the blocks just<br>aren't long enough to refer us to assign<br>the ancestry to it but what's coming out<br>we've got Shetland Sheepdog German<br>Shepherd Australian Shepherd cocker<br>spaniel a whole different set of breeds<br>mixing into this one dog and we see this<br>as I said with every single one of the<br>breeds the mutts that we've looked at so<br>far so this the way this is color coded<br>does not bite<br>what breed it is but basically the<br>darkest red is the top breed in that dog<br>and the slightly lighter red is the<br>second top breed in that dog and what<br>you can see is that with a few<br>exceptions like Sampson down here which<br>had a chunk of ancestry from the German<br>shepherds I think every single one of<br>these mutts has a whole lot of different<br>mixed breeds going into it and this is<br>one of the dogs this is lucky lucky<br>belongs to Jeremy in this group Lucky's<br>top breed with shih tzu it's about five<br>to ten percent shih tzu Jeremy's very<br>upset about this<br>told me told us his dog is not a shih<br>tzu and we weren't allowed to say that<br>but yes it's a Jack Russell Terrier<br>beagle toy poodle and that's lucky there<br>and what I also really like about this<br>is we can do this kind of chromosome<br>painting thing so we're still working on<br>the algorithms to get this really<br>cleaned up but what you can see is that<br>lucky does in fact have dropped ears and<br>if you look at the drop at your locus<br>that's one that's been mapped you can<br>see he's got toy poodle ancestry on both<br>chromosomes at that locus he actually<br>carries the high altitude adaptation<br>from the Lhasa Apso and he does in fact<br>have lasso Apso ancestry and a big chunk<br>in that region<br>he's got furnishings which are these<br>kind of like moustachy things coming out<br>and he's home he's heterozygous for that<br>trick coming in from the last up so as<br>well and then he's actually heterozygous<br>for brachycephaly which is the really<br>really short snout that you see in the<br>Boston Terriers and if you look at him<br>he does in fact have a little bit of a<br>shorter snout than what you would expect<br>and it's probably reflecting that<br>heterozygosity<br>and so we're actually planning next and<br>hopefully we're gonna have this up in<br>about six weeks is we're actually going<br>to ask people to guess what the mutts<br>are and see how close they get so we're<br>just gonna have a website when we put up<br>a couple of photos and video of each<br>mutt and ask people to guess what the<br>top three breeds are in them and then<br>we're gonna release the answers at the<br>end of this and just see how close<br>everybody gets to guessing what all of<br>these dogs are and I'm really curious to<br>find out I suspect people will be really<br>bad at it but I could be wrong we're<br>also trying to develop a test a nap so<br>we could actually start doing behavioral<br>tests on these dogs actually ask the<br>owners to actually do things with their<br>dogs and record the results you know an<br>app based kind of framework gives us a<br>lot of power to do this kind of thing<br>because rather than asking somebody to<br>time something and write down the time<br>we can just say press the start button<br>when you start press the any button when<br>you end and then record the time<br>ourselves the whole idea behind this is<br>that it's a collaboration between the<br>dog owners and the scientists and so the<br>idea here is that it's a shared resource<br>we don't own the data we're going to<br>make the data public we're going to<br>share it with other scientists we're<br>going to share with the owners<br>themselves this is hopefully going to be<br>a resource that will make dog genetics a<br>much bigger opportunity for everybody to<br>work in if we can just kind of get much<br>larger data sets out they're really<br>modeled on the idea behind X a can<br>nomads which are these large genomic<br>data sets that they they put out from<br>human genetic variation which is so<br>powerful for the OCD study we did in<br>humans and I suspect and I'll probably<br>talk about in his<br>talk tomorrow night I'm accept something<br>his groups been working on at the broad<br>we do not have a name yet for the dog<br>version of this I refuse to call it<br>something like X Acker nomads there's no<br>it not allowed to be any silent letters<br>or weird capitalization because that's<br>really hard to explain to people and we<br>also have a really cool study going on<br>when we're doing dog versus wolves from<br>was studying domestication and dogs is<br>they're all domesticated so we're<br>actually trying to see if we can<br>actually combine some cool epigenetics<br>using a tack seek to look at what<br>regions of the genome were active and<br>wolf puppies and then also do some crate<br>mapping in wolfdog hybrids it turns out<br>that in the sanctuaries all across the<br>US for wolves the vast majority of the<br>animals or hybrids that are mixed<br>variable generations away from pure so<br>we're just gonna do a mapping study of<br>the domestication related behaviors and<br>those dogs and then finally we did as we<br>were saying this morning we got our<br>first New Zealand dogs enrolled so about<br>30 people went online and answered all<br>of our questions beforehand and then<br>brought their dogs over and we got<br>saliva samples this morning and I'm<br>really excited about this because so far<br>we've really been focused on the u.s.<br>population which is really nice but it's<br>one population and in New Zealand we're<br>gonna have first of all a whole<br>different set of founder breeds that are<br>going on that are kind of going into the<br>population to begin with we have the<br>breeds that we have all the European<br>breeds coming in and then we have the<br>dogs who are already here before the<br>Europeans showed up we also have<br>different selective pressures as<br>possible to the fact that there was a<br>lot more kind of emphasis on you know<br>working dogs or sheepdogs or something<br>like that and the New Zealand population<br>may actually create a whole different<br>profile in terms of genetics of the New<br>Zealand dog population<br>I will admit I also use it as an excuse<br>to get DNA samples for my cousin's dogs<br>I've been cat Rangga so now I'm going to<br>have them in the study as well and<br>finally I just wanted to thank everybody<br>who's been involved in this project<br>especially my group at the University of<br>Massachusetts Medical School and at the<br>broad and the animal behavior people<br>that I work with and the people at the<br>McGovern Institute who really helped<br>with the OCD stuff and of course all of<br>the citizen science dog owners out there<br>and their dogs because that's really<br>what makes all of this possible thank<br>you<br>- and John and I will run up and your<br>microphones that we can and will be<br>so dogs are technically a subspecies of<br>wolf so they're the same species but the<br>wolf populations have been through some<br>pretty severe bottlenecks over the years<br>we have a habit of killing wolves off in<br>large numbers so in general the<br>populations themselves often have quite<br>limited genetic diversity and that's one<br>of the things that we've really<br>struggled with in terms of understanding<br>some of the ancestry of dogs is that we<br>don't think that the population they<br>were domesticated from is actually<br>necessarily around anymore which is the<br>source of a lot of that ambiguity around<br>when domestication when and where<br>domestication happened to begin with we<br>don't know so that's kind of the<br>question whether there was one or more<br>domestication events whether they were<br>all successful whether one was more<br>successful than the other it's a really<br>kind of interesting and very rich field<br>of study right now and the newest work<br>that's really interesting is where<br>rather than trying to look at the modern<br>populations because this populations of<br>wolves have had these weird<br>bottlenecking events and things people<br>are actually going back to the ancient<br>DNA so they're finding the remains of<br>the dogs and the wolves and actually<br>looking directly at that to actually get<br>the old populations rather than trying<br>to infer it from what they see in the<br>No so it's a really interesting<br>combination of factors so within each<br>dog breed it appears that the vast<br>majority of the selection is driven by<br>morphology so what the dog looks like<br>rather than what it does if you look at<br>the biggest regions of homozygosity they<br>almost all have a morphology gene in<br>them even if there's also a brain gene<br>there's always a morphology gene in<br>there and on top of that if you actually<br>look at the information that's out there<br>trying to connect breeds with behaviors<br>the correlation is a lot weaker than a<br>lot of times we assume even in what we<br>see in our own data set we do see things<br>like retrieving as a kind of discrete<br>behavior does show up more in retriever<br>breeds but when you get to things like<br>you know aggression and things like that<br>we don't see a correlation between breed<br>and behavior at all we see a little bit<br>of a correlation for most behaviors with<br>size but not with the actual breed of<br>the dogs and so that's something that<br>we're busy kind of digging into in more<br>detail now to make sure that we're<br>actually asking the right questions to<br>get at that but my my current suspicion<br>is that behavior needs to be continually<br>selected on to really be maintained in a<br>population so I think that to really get<br>at those clear behaviors in populations<br>of dogs<br>you're better at going back to a<br>population that's still a working dog<br>population that's being kind of<br>continually selected for whatever the<br>behavior is rather than a breed that's<br>kind of used to be selected for that<br>behavior but since then all sorts of<br>other stuff that's been happening yes<br>thank you<br>dogs also have issues with communication<br>surrounding their anxiety OCD and we<br>that you're seeing same gene variances<br>they have reported you know that's a<br>really great question that we actually<br>have the potential to ask we're not<br>asking it yet but it's something that<br>we've kind of started talking about<br>because first of all the question will<br>be how well people can give us that<br>information and I suspect they actually<br>would be really good at it if we could<br>actually get them to tell us what what<br>medications their dogs are taking and<br>things like that and so that would be a<br>place to start and in the longer term<br>there's also the potential most of the<br>veterinary plate veterinary clinics at<br>least in the US and I suspect here too<br>are moving over to electronic medical<br>records and because with dogs we don't<br>have the same issues with and we were<br>very careful with privacy and<br>confidentiality but the legal burden is<br>not as high as it is we're dealing with<br>human patients we actually have the<br>potential to get those electronic<br>medical records and try figuring out how<br>we can actually integrate that with the<br>yes and that's something I haven't done<br>yet but I would love to add more species<br>into that comparison so I think in<br>horses this is not my expertise but my<br>understanding is in horses you see<br>something they call cribbing we just<br>thought to be a compulsive behavior<br>where they chew on their on wood around<br>in their enclosure or whatever and I<br>think in feather in birds there may be<br>some suspicion that there's kind of a<br>feather picking kind of thing that they<br>do that might be a compulsive behavior<br>that's a little bit complicated because<br>of the difficulty of compulsive<br>behaviors often showing up in captive<br>animal populations if they're you know<br>poor enrichment or whatever other<br>reasons if they're anxious are stressed<br>and that's obviously an environmental<br>form of a compulsion disorder not a<br>genetic form but I think there's an<br>awful lot of potential there if you<br>could actually define it well and know<br>what you were looking at add more<br>species into that that kind of network<br>it's an interesting question so village<br>dogs are technically defined as dogs<br>that have not been through any breed<br>bottlenecks so you know to create a dog<br>breed you select the number of dogs that<br>do what you want them to do and then<br>breed them together village dogs have<br>never been through that process and<br>thought to just kind of be dogs before<br>all that happened lap dogs are kind of<br>interesting in terms of behavior because<br>I kind of thought originally that they<br>were just small dogs but it turns out<br>they may actually also have a need to be<br>near you which is kind of an interesting<br>behavior so they apparently really like<br>to be in contact with you at all times<br>and so I think it's you know we were<br>doing something recently where we were<br>sitting down and we're like we're<br>getting there retrieving breeds and non<br>retrieving breeds and find all the<br>differences between them and being dog<br>geneticists we sat down and defined<br>retrieving breeds by those that had<br>Retriever in the name and non retrieving<br>breeds I suppose it didn't have<br>Retriever in the name but very recently<br>somebody a person called her name's<br>Catherine Lord and she's worked in dog<br>and wolf behavior forever she's the one<br>that's running the wolf work that I'm<br>doing right now and she kind of walked<br>into the room and she was like no no no<br>no no this is not right<br>and she got it backed up and talked us<br>through what it was and how it related<br>to both predatory behavior and hunting<br>sequences and everything so I think<br>there is actually a lot of potential to<br>kind of dig in a little bit more detail<br>that making sure we're defining behavior<br>in a way that makes sense and drawing<br>I'm a hero traits like aggression he<br>said that don't necessarily correlate<br>well with breed of dog do you think that<br>that could partly be due to the<br>background and potential form of the<br>dogs depending on whether may come from<br>a shelter or rescue versus so I think<br>it's a really interesting question I<br>mean obviously these are traits that are<br>have a very strong environmental<br>influence and I actually try to avoid<br>talking about aggression because it's<br>such a loaded term that it's very hard<br>to define in terms of specific behaviors<br>necessarily but I think it kind of goes<br>both ways it's hard to necessarily<br>define it in a popular you know maybe<br>not may not be seeing the correlation<br>with particular populations because of<br>the environmental effects but I think<br>the fact that the environment has such a<br>big impact on a complex behavior like<br>aggression also suggests that it would<br>be much harder for humans to have<br>selected on it and enriched it in a<br>population to begin with in the past I<br>think that doing so selecting for a<br>complex behavioral trait that involves<br>many many different genes and<br>environmental factors is just going to<br>take a long time and I'm unconvinced<br>that humans have the patience for that<br>I think they tended to select on traits<br>where they could see a change in a<br>so we technically we state the question<br>is how tall is your dog relative to a<br>normal sized person rather than relative<br>to you for that reason we're going to<br>have differences because of the size of<br>the people we're also going to have<br>differences because people are just<br>going to interpret our question<br>differently there's a huge amount of<br>noise involved in a study where you ask<br>people to give you information which is<br>part of the reason why we need so many<br>dogs signed up we did have an<br>interesting discussion recently in the<br>group that was kind of tied to this<br>where one of the questions we asked<br>about is how much white coat color does<br>your dog have and we use this classic<br>series of how much white coat color you<br>have from this book called by this guy<br>called Clarence little that goes from<br>totally white to totally dark and very<br>spotting in between we put this up and<br>people all answered it and we have<br>genetic data from a couple hundred dogs<br>since we ran a genome-wide Association<br>study of how much white coat color do<br>you have and we actually got something<br>that might be a real association we're<br>not totally sure yet but when I was<br>talking to the postdoc and asked them to<br>pull up pictures of the dogs that were<br>homozygous for the white version of this<br>gene they were all they weren't white<br>they were cream which from the dog<br>owners point of view is the same thing I<br>mean but from a genetics point of view<br>white means you don't have any pigment<br>cells in your skin and cream means you<br>do have pigment cells you're just<br>producing a different color or not as<br>much pigment and so it's a completely<br>valid answer that the owners are giving<br>to us but it was just one of these<br>moments where the question we were<br>asking wasn't quite the question that<br>no we haven't done any work with village<br>dogs yet so the data that we have from<br>village dogs is actually mostly<br>throughout in Boyko a bit Cornell he<br>does or he's published a number of<br>papers and does a fantastic job of<br>sharing his data which makes it very<br>easy to access I'm sure anybody here<br>that's worked with share data knows that<br>people that use consistent file formats<br>and things are wonderful wonderful<br>people</p></main><footer
