accurate.</p><p>I was doing well in the career I was a<br>sales consultant I reached a stage in my<br>life where I felt I needed to advance<br>myself and go forward after 20 years of<br>being away I needed to know that I was<br>able to meet the criteria and be<br>confident that I could handle university<br>studies<br>I studied new step because as a teenager<br>I started with me into illness and I was<br>unable to finished high school they came<br>from a small town where everybody knew<br>my mental health background so it was<br>always sort of like they tiptoed around<br>me you just like gave me the opportunity<br>to experience university life when I<br>didn't feel prepared at all for it I<br>enrolled into university degree<br>specializing in nursing but it was<br>unsuitable for me I was recommended by<br>my friend to university preparation<br>course in University of Auckland so I<br>started you start I finished school when<br>I was 16 and couldn't get into<br>university without doing a pre start of<br>course so I decided to go with new start<br>once you're over 20 it's a good program<br>to start with<br>I studied music general in psychology<br>sociology and philosophy which led me to<br>study in my Bachelor of Social Work a<br>new star general I did English and<br>sociology and I think it was history how<br>they structured it was in a way where I<br>could see for myself where I had to work<br>long<br>I studied the enduring mathematics short<br>maths course and use that you know I did<br>enjoy mathematics because I hadn't done<br>mess at the high school and mess was<br>never something I enjoyed but I felt<br>like it was something that I would<br>probably need at some point I studied<br>Neustadt general and after I completed<br>that I studied a Bachelor of Arts and<br>specialized in geography for my first<br>semester once I'd finished there I<br>transitioned into a Bachelor of Science<br>prepared me for writing essays<br>referencing all those sort of things<br>time management that you really need for<br>university it really gave me the<br>confidence to actually get stuck into<br>university communication skills writing<br>skills writing essays and reports just<br>being able to academically understand<br>things as well the teachers the<br>resources gave me insight but the best<br>part was it gave me a teach in gaining<br>time management skills as well handling<br>my assessments my essays how to do a<br>reference in terms of reading it's not<br>about reading the whole text book that's<br>about highlighting the key points and<br>making it meaningful to you<br>was actually doing anthropology and you<br>start that opened me up to actually<br>doing a double major and anthropology<br>and ancient history<br>the teachers inspired me an interest in<br>sociology and psychology therefore I<br>chose Social Work degree a Bachelor of<br>Arts and criminology and sociology I<br>went into a bachelor's because I found<br>out to do a range of different subjects<br>I transitioned into a Bachelor of<br>Science<br>I did my honours and science and I'm<br>currently doing my masters and a science<br>doing marine geology affect that house<br>surrounded in a younger environment gave<br>me that sort of extra push to keep going<br>you know because there are obstacles<br>that just get thrown at you<br>maths was a big challenge I'm not<br>finishing school didn't help with it but<br>I've having friends along the way it's<br>really helped in doing stage one papers<br>and that's helped as well time<br>management was the biggest challenge<br>that I faced especially balancing<br>full-time work and studying the biggest<br>challenge at university has been<br>managing my life like the timewise with<br>my social life University study and my<br>I guess the best parts for me at<br>university was the networks that you<br>built it's not just about the resources<br>and learning the best parts were meeting<br>people and also with being in Earth<br>Sciences you can go on lots of field<br>trips and spins weeks with your friends<br>that you make as well knowing other<br>people who are quite similar situation<br>with me and also learning diverse<br>subjects was the biggest part meeting<br>the different people I've got a few<br>people who I have went through new start<br>with who I'm still friends with today<br>and we meet up every week you start as a<br>good foundation for people who were out<br>of Education for a long time there is<br>really no age limit pursuing your<br>education to continue education going<br>further it's so helpful you learned all<br>these sorts of things that you really<br>need for university life and it helps to<br>prepare you not only for university but<br>also for life as well if anyone's<br>considering doing you started say just<br>go for it it's opened a lot of doors for<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
