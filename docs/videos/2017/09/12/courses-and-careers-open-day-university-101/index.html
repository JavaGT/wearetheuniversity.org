market everyone amo Tamaki Makaurau<br>and my Haider my Mirena comedian a<br>taquito Quinn Mallory tiene no the<br>ferret approval Ngapuhi I know Tara waka<br>code to cry focus on our Maori kikoenai<br>more than everyone thank you so much for<br>being here and my name is Mariana I'm a<br>school's advisor with the schools<br>partnership office I'm lucky enough to<br>be a part of a wider team that traveled<br>around the country promoting a further<br>education to many of your sons daughters<br>throughout the country in this part of<br>the this part of the morning is just a<br>bit of information about University I'm<br>so centrally at a university you're<br>currently on our campus we have a number<br>of different campuses ok the Grafton<br>campus is up near the Auckland City<br>Hospital we've also got an imp Epsom<br>campus which is at the foot of manga pho<br>or Mount Eden okay which is where<br>education and social workers taught as<br>well as sport health and physical<br>education and we've also got a Tamaki<br>campus we've got satellite campuses out<br>of MIT and altura another education<br>campus and fanger a and then this is our<br>City campus on those campuses we have<br>faculties which group to give a common<br>subjects in degrees similar to a<br>department at your school okay so many<br>of you will have a science department<br>and in some cases a P Department in an<br>English department these departments or<br>subject areas teach courses so at this<br>university we call them courses and as<br>part of those courses you will be<br>required to attend lectures and in some<br>cases tutorials and labs these are eight<br>faculties and that you can study it at<br>the University of Auckland and these the<br>degrees that fall under the under them<br>so basically the Bachelor of Arts is<br>more about your liberal arts okay your<br>social sciences and your languages then<br>you've got the Business School which is<br>the home of the Bachelor of Commerce and<br>also a property it's important to note<br>that you do not need a degree to sell a<br>house this degree looks at things like<br>land evaluation and legislation okay<br>then you've got the chi or the creative<br>arts and industries and which is where<br>architecture urban planning music Fine<br>Arts and dancers you also have the<br>Faculty of Education and social work<br>which is obviously for those of you who<br>are looking to become a teacher a social<br>worker or do things like health<br>promotion within schools n PE teaching<br>we also have the Bachelor of engineering<br>which is a four-year degree with<br>built-in honours The Bachelor of Laws<br>which must be canto Andrew with another<br>degree and the Faculty of medical and<br>Health Sciences the last and our largest<br>faculty is the Faculty of science which<br>holds the largest numbers of majors okay<br>a contract program so essentially a<br>contract program is if I wanted to do a<br>Bachelor of Science and then I decided<br>I'd also like to do a Bachelor of Arts<br>and I did them one after the other it<br>would take me six years to complete them<br>if I conjoint it it'll take me for okay<br>so double qualify it in a shorter amount<br>of time<br>for obvious reasons you cannot quandry<br>everything like medicine as an example<br>mostly because it would cost you a lot<br>and also it would take you a very long<br>time to complete this you also can't<br>conjoint things like education because<br>more often than not in your first year<br>you are already shadowing and on<br>placement entry requirements now this is<br>really just for those parents in the<br>room because we understand that your<br>children don't want to explain to you<br>exactly what they need to do to get into<br>university in some cases so very briefly<br>I'm just going to<br>explain mostly so that parents have an<br>understanding of what your what your<br>children should be attaining or their<br>son at high school entry requirements so<br>there are four steps okay it's important<br>to note that not all four steps apply I<br>will be speaking on both all each<br>requirement so NCEA CIA or Cambridge and<br>also I be so step one for university<br>entrance<br>NCE aim this is what it looks like okay<br>so essentially at level 1 which is year<br>11 students need the 10 numeracy credits<br>at level 2 year 12 they need 10 literacy<br>credits 5 credits and reading 5 credits<br>in writing and at level 3 they need a<br>minimum of 60 credits including 13<br>subjects Oh 13 credits and three<br>approved subjects okay the university<br>has nothing to do with what is or isn't<br>approved if they have questions about<br>the subjects that they're currently<br>studying they must go back to the<br>careers advisor or the school this is<br>university entrance for those students<br>who are currently doing Cambridge<br>examinations so you need maths a<br>tardigrade or higher for your IGCSE okay<br>you need English at a grade or higher<br>for a is a is levels and then a is or a<br>levels you need 120 points on the UTS<br>tariff this is step 2 this is how we<br>calculate ranked scores okay so this is<br>specific to how we calculate rank scores<br>here at the University of Auckland so<br>basically we take 80 of your best<br>credits from level 3 and we weigh them<br>by what they're worth okay so if I was a<br>year 13 chittim this year and 80 of my<br>best credits are all and achieved level<br>80 times 2 is going to give me a rank<br>score of 160 which means that I could<br>get into a Bachelor of Arts I would be 5<br>points short of most<br>the majors in a Bachelor of Science and<br>there would be no way that I could get<br>into engineering okay if I wanted to get<br>into engineering with that rank score I<br>need to be getting those excellences and<br>merits does everyone understand and it's<br>only level 3 credits this is how we<br>calculate ranked scores for those<br>students who are currently completing<br>Cambridge okay so we take your UK tariff<br>okay across the best six subjects okay<br>as you can see your a-levels are worth<br>more than your IES levels okay and it's<br>similar to how you calculate the rec<br>scores for in CEA and that's step two if<br>that is all you require and you get<br>university interim step one and you<br>attain the rank score step two and that<br>is all you require you will be offered a<br>place okay same with I be okay only<br>these six degrees have subject<br>requirements so this is step three okay<br>I'll start from the bottom so for anyone<br>who's interested in studying engineering<br>okay basically you need all of the<br>external credits and physics in calculus<br>okay Health Sciences and nursing as well<br>as Commerce property and architecture<br>meaning that you need to have table a<br>and table B subjects this is table a and<br>this is table B so anyone who's<br>interested in architecture so long as<br>you have one table a in one table fee<br>okay<br>you will meet those subject requirements<br>for The Bachelor of Commerce and The<br>Bachelor of property so long as you have<br>three subjects from either side so you<br>can have one from table a and two from<br>table B or vice versa so long as you<br>have three that fall within that table<br>okay also so step one is university<br>entrance<br>step two is ranked school and these six<br>degrees have subject requirements if you<br>meet all three of those requirements<br>again by law we must offer you a place<br>okay<br>this is table a in table B for those<br>students who are doing Cambridge and<br>this is step four okay so essentially<br>these are the creative arts and<br>education and social work so for things<br>like music and dance you will be<br>required to complete an audition but<br>it's not like x-factor where they stand<br>you up in front of their men attempt to<br>rip you to shreds<br>essentially it's if you're going for<br>music I mean you can submit you can<br>either come in for an audition or you<br>can some you can send us a URL of you<br>performing or somebody performing<br>something that you have composed if<br>you're going for dance they usually try<br>and get you to come here they teach you<br>a set at the end of that set then they<br>they contact you following their okay<br>there's also a written statement for<br>urban planning just to kind of get a<br>gauge on what you already know about it<br>and in the portfolio which can be<br>uploaded online as basically there are I<br>will definitely advice for those of you<br>who are interested in fine art in<br>architecture when it comes to your<br>portfolio if you haven't already<br>submitted it and to go to the workshops<br>later on today okay<br>also for education and social work in<br>some cases there is an interview just to<br>make sure you're not crazy and also<br>please check so there has been some<br>miscommunication with the academic<br>English language requirement or the AEL<br>are okay so it is only recommended that<br>students come to us with the 17 English<br>credits and it can be a mixture of level<br>2 and level 3 okay<br>some schools have made it compulsory we<br>will still take the students in saying<br>that in place of your one options or<br>what we call general education course<br>here at the University of Auckland you<br>will be required to do an academic<br>English writing course okay just because<br>I know myself that many of them don't<br>understand how to reference things and<br>have an understanding<br>so just in place of it you will be<br>required to do an academic language<br>class English language though so very<br>quickly how to apply it's really<br>straightforward for those of you who<br>have not yet apply you just everything<br>is done online okay here's some<br>university terminology for you I'll<br>start from the bottom make it so it's<br>school students will have four terms at<br>University we have two semesters okay<br>points<br>I'm the best way for me to describe it<br>is using an NCE a I'm student as an<br>example points almost like credits okay<br>so these are the credits slash points<br>that you need to attain in order to pass<br>to get to the next level your elective<br>okay is something that you elect okay<br>that falls under the same umbrella of<br>the faculty that you study with and so<br>if you're doing a Bachelor of Arts you<br>can do anthropology as an elective okay<br>general education is your one<br>opportunity to do one options course<br>outside of the faculty that you study<br>and so elective under the same umbrella<br>general education outside of the<br>umbrella that you in which you study it<br>okay<br>I love the terminology but I always like<br>to explain to many students is that they<br>don't have a good understanding of major<br>and minor okay so if a student wants to<br>study a Bachelor of Science and they<br>want to major in something and minor in<br>something else<br>essentially so in one year in a single<br>degree you have to complete four courses<br>okay if you are majoring the majority of<br>your courses are going to come from that<br>subject so if I wanted to major in Comp<br>Sci okay my five courses would be the<br>majority and my minor could be in<br>physics okay so that's the major in the<br>minor obviously if you double major it's<br>these are some of the things that you<br>can study with your general education<br>the last time I looked at the schedule<br>there was planets stars and galaxies<br>that you could study I depreciation<br>where you go around to all the art<br>galleries and write about what you think<br>that they were trying to create this is<br>an example of what a time table might<br>look like I can tell you now for anyone<br>who is interested in studying and<br>biomedical sciences I'm not telling you<br>this to scare you<br>there's not a lot of white okay and and<br>the white comes in about lunchtime and<br>that's about it also for many of you who<br>have travelled really far I I do come<br>from a wider team and many of us if we<br>haven't already been into your schools<br>we will be coming and we'll also be<br>doing course planning or in course<br>advice to help you to build these<br>timetables so that next year hopefully<br>when you choose to come and study with<br>us and the transition to enrolling<br>yourself okay is easier so it's very<br>different we're not going to give you a<br>timetable that says at nine o'clock you<br>must go to history and at ten o'clock<br>you must go to geography you must<br>actually create this timetable for<br>yourself and it's our job to help with<br>that transition okay so if you haven't<br>seen anyone from our team just yet make<br>sure you go to those course planning<br>sessions this is just some of the fun<br>stuff okay so while you know we have a<br>lot of academic support okay there is<br>also life outside the lecture theatre<br>that comes in the form of orientation<br>week okay so there is a lot of things<br>happening at Oh week okay and there's a<br>lot of free stuff there's a lot of free<br>food so find all of those there's some<br>concerts there's some comedy club nights<br>and there's a lot of sports as well that<br>you can go to into faculty sports so if<br>you play sports surfers in the region<br>that you come from or even<br>New Zealand you can continue to do that<br>okay you can also represent the hall of<br>residence that you live in the faculty<br>that you study in and also the<br>University at University Games okay this<br>is just the photo that I found but you<br>can represent them and things like<br>there's ten hours<br>there's even futsal whatever that is I<br>hope there's like Ultimate Frisbee and<br>there are whole heap of things and that<br>you can compete in every year we have<br>great work I'm a race that's so popular<br>that we run out of Walker<br>so essentially what that is is it's a 12<br>K pedal to Dungey total which is the<br>volcano out in the white Amata students<br>must run to the summit run back down and<br>in pedal the last 12 back okay winners<br>of that get an all-expenses trip paid<br>through Hawaii they are currently<br>they're completing in the competing in<br>the Queen Liliuokalani which is the<br>30-mile pedal last for the last two<br>years Engineering has won okay<br>and they came second in the means last<br>year in Hawaii so if any of you pedal<br>you're more than welcome to start your<br>own team up and hopefully take the title<br>off engineering the club's Expo is a<br>great way for you to meet like-minded<br>people ok so at high school for those of<br>you who are still high school students<br>you might find it hard to find a lot of<br>like-minded people the benefits of the<br>clubs here is that there are a whole<br>heap the most popular club that we have<br>currently on campus as the meet Club<br>eating meat club they were created in<br>opposition to the to the vegetarians<br>Club and basically every few weeks they<br>have a barbecue so sausage sizzles and<br>stuff like that if you pay to be a part<br>of their meat club you get to skip the<br>line and so I believe it<br>fifteen to twenty dollars I think a year<br>maybe $30 one might be you you pay for a<br>yearly fee and they give you a t-shirt<br>and they also text you they're like hey<br>we're in the quad having a barbecue so<br>if you're on the meat club you can skip<br>the whole line and usually it goes<br>forever because free food and so that's<br>one of the clubs stickin to the meat<br>club as the dessert club where they send<br>you cultures to go to places like I'm<br>chapel and so those are some of the<br>clubs but I mean also if you have I<br>don't know a passion for Justin Bieber<br>you can create your own club as well<br>these are some of the clubs that we have<br>I was gonna change that so obviously as<br>you can see there are a whole heap of<br>clubs that you can join okay<br>and there are cultural clubs there are<br>snowboarding clubs and walking clubs and<br>underwater clubs okay and you can join<br>more than one it's your way to find<br>people who are like-minded okay<br>also I'm support services so there are<br>approximately 42,000 students here at<br>the University of Auckland don't worry<br>they're not all here at the same time<br>but basically it's not like when you're<br>in high school if you need the help you<br>actually have to be proactive about<br>coming to us and seeking it there are<br>people who get paid to help you okay so<br>I'm not just talking academics as well<br>we also have a number of counselors and<br>doctors okay so the academic side there<br>are academic advisors in all of the<br>faculties okay and then there are also<br>counsellors and a whole heap of learning<br>centres there's also the careers hub as<br>well the careers team so for those of<br>you who are looking for opportunities<br>while you're studying there are a number<br>of ways that you can get internships<br>every few weeks I also get emails asking<br>if I know students who are interested in<br>or who are currently completing this<br>major and would be interested in I don't<br>know a placement at ASB bank okay so<br>they will help you with writing your CV<br>and cover letters they will also<br>interview you as well and if you haven't<br>ever been interviewed before so this is<br>the support that we have for you okay<br>this is just a list so that you can see<br>so even the support stretches up to all<br>of the halls of residences as well so<br>you don't have to worry if you're on<br>halls or residences about not being<br>supportive supported um although if you<br>aren't going into the halls residences<br>again you are welcome to all of the<br>services that you see behind me as well<br>this is just a screenshot that I took<br>from the careers hub okay which<br>essentially is the necessary steps that<br>they can help with ticket you<br>places our placements also for those of<br>you who are interested in traveling we<br>have a 360 abroad program which is<br>usually done in your second year these<br>are only the countries that we send<br>students to there are 90 90 plus<br>universities that we have partnerships<br>with where you can go and study in your<br>second year ok the benefits I guess the<br>major benefits of this is that you will<br>not be paying international student fees<br>you will pay exactly what you pay here<br>to go to the University of Southern<br>California ok<br>finally this is my last slide I think<br>basically this is the information for<br>all of the faculties so if you are<br>struggling with an application or you<br>have a few questions my advice would be<br>to take this information down also if<br>you wanted additional support or some<br>guidance on the majors or the double<br>major that you're looking at going into<br>this would be a good way or this this<br>would be a good contact for you to to<br>make to make contact with other than<br>there thank you all so much for being<br>here I understand the weather is not<br>great outside but have a lovely day and<br>we are here to answer any questions you<br>might have<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
