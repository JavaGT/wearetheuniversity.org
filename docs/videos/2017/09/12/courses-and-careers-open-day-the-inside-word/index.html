style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>okay hello everyone my name is Simon<br>crook I am a member of schools<br>partnership office here at the<br>University of Auckland but my other role<br>is to coordinate the inside word student<br>blog here at the University so the<br>inside word has been running for about<br>six years now and every single year we<br>choose some wonderful first-year<br>students and they blog about their<br>entire experience so if you've been<br>reading the inside word you'll be quite<br>familiar with these people down on the<br>front here and I'll get them to run down<br>and introduce themselves and then we'll<br>basically just have a bit of a chat and<br>you can ask some questions but I'll feed<br>some questions as well and which<br>everybody yarn for half an hour so Dicky<br>don't kick us off sure hey guys my name<br>is Rebecca I'm from Gibbon and I went to<br>Campion College and yeah oh what am i<br>studying<br>I'm studying health science and trying<br>to get into meat which is a bit of a<br>struggle but it's it's really fun yeah<br>um hey I'm Callum I'm from Wellington I<br>went to our PAC College and I'm<br>currently studying law contract degree<br>with arts I'm Tate I'm from Tauranga I<br>went to tutting a girls college got a<br>couple of people here from there so<br>that's exciting I'm living in O'Rourke<br>this yet and I'm doing a conjoint law<br>and arts degree like Callum hi I'm<br>Eunice I'm originally from California<br>but I went to high school in Wellington<br>at Newlands College right now I'm living<br>in hooyah and I'm studying social work<br>hi I'm sana and I'm from Auckland I went<br>to botany down secondary College and I'm<br>currently studying biomedical science<br>which is like the other route to<br>medicine and I am living in Oracle Yoda<br>arm I'm Matthew Koriyama I am from the<br>sunny shore of Auckland I went to<br>Rosemary College and at the moment I am<br>studying a Bachelor of music and<br>classical singing nice thanks guys so<br>just to get the ball rolling the first<br>thing I want to know is why here<br>why why did you come here and I feel<br>that to whoever wants to speak for it<br>why University vocal okay well for me<br>what struck me about Auckland University<br>and Auckland as a whole was first of all<br>within the University there are so many<br>niche options for the courses you can<br>pick particularly within a Bachelor of<br>Arts I'm majoring in European studies in<br>English but European studies is this<br>weird thing that no one's even really<br>heard of but it allowed me to do<br>classical studies and art history and<br>all the individual things that<br>interested me under one umbrella so<br>everything that you could imagine pretty<br>much is offered yeah and on top of that<br>we had the top law school in the country<br>so as a law arts conjoint that was a<br>really strong pull for me to be here and<br>also Auckland does the city everything<br>is always going on there's tons of<br>theatre if the touring theatre company<br>comes to New Zealand they usually come<br>here and same with concerts so as a bit<br>of a cultural junkie that was really big<br>for me I think for me coming from<br>Wellington a lot of people wondered why<br>I'd want to move talk and do law in<br>Wellington was just fine for that but I<br>needed to change the scenery I wanted to<br>kind of branch out and experience new<br>things and the student life is so<br>different from what you hear and you<br>have to really experience in Auckland<br>always appealed to me and so I came up<br>here quite often and I fell in love with<br>the city so really I knew I really<br>wanted to live here and although when I<br>initially moved here I didn't there's so<br>much to offer from the University there<br>and just really pulled me yeah I'm so<br>originally I after high school I moved<br>straight back to California because I<br>was like okay I'm gonna go to University<br>in California<br>um and I realized that school is like so<br>flippin expensive it's like $25,000 a<br>year for like a mediocre<br>diversity and I really I really didn't<br>want to take out a loan that big so I<br>decided to move back to New Zealand and<br>I missed New Zealand as well and I<br>decided to go with Auckland because<br>Wellington doesn't really offer a Social<br>Work course um and I was choosing<br>between Massey and Auckland and I went<br>with Auckland one because of the city<br>like I absolutely love the city and -<br>it's just I felt like it was a more<br>well it was pretty nice to go University<br>when it's like I live in or walk five<br>minutes away but it's also nice to be<br>like 30 minutes away from my actual<br>house and the course I'm intending to do<br>is actually only offered at Auckland<br>University or Otago University and yeah<br>I did apply there and I have been there<br>but it's just a little too cold for my<br>liking<br>um and as you can tell I was already<br>drenched in the rain from walking here<br>and I did not like it very much so yeah<br>Auckland was what I had my sights on<br>it's been like it's pretty familiar to<br>me since I live in Auckland and of<br>course I've been to the city often and<br>so yeah that is why I'm here yeah I'm I<br>grew up in Auckland and on the shore<br>I've been fortunate enough to live in<br>other big cities are in the world but<br>like Auckland's always been my home and<br>no my friend group and sorta like<br>connections and stuff um through like<br>what I want to do was here my courses<br>are very sort of like precise and the<br>sense that it is like an opera course<br>would just like a little bit different<br>you know a little bit hipster and so it<br>was only really here Wellington or Otago<br>and I had quite a few of my friends go<br>go down to Wellington a note I go so I<br>was really really considering it but it<br>came down to I was fortunate enough to<br>experience a George Turner scholarship<br>last year which and able to sort of<br>taste this the trailer type thing where<br>I got eight lessons with the University<br>music department and I got to experience<br>sort of like masterclass lessons where<br>the teachers and who dr. chiotti who<br>turned out to be my singing teacher and<br>it was just a lot more personal for me<br>they really wanted to know why I was<br>doing it and and what they wanted to get<br>out of me and sort of you know tailored<br>my course so I'm just talking about the<br>individual essence of of the singing<br>class itself tailored it for me and I<br>really felt like I was being treated a<br>one on one basis my classes are quite<br>small as well which really creates that<br>sort of like homely environment so I<br>just really got a great sort of feel<br>vibe if you will moving for Auckland<br>University so that was why and of course<br>it's like ten minutes away from my house<br>so bit of a no-brainer on the cost side<br>of things as well and what about you<br>being here so you are probably from per<br>capita the smallest town of everybody in<br>the group away from here but I'm just<br>like sana I was tossing that between<br>Otago and Auckland and I was actually<br>really difficult for me like I didn't<br>actually decide where I wanted to go<br>into probably months of summer and the<br>thing that really kind of pulled me<br>towards open is that I was really<br>fortunate enough to get a scholarship<br>which was really awesome and yeah<br>cosplays a big factor in University but<br>yeah so that was one thing I was really<br>fortunate enough to come on a few trips<br>up to Auckland when I was in high school<br>and so I really got a good feel for the<br>campus and met a few friends that also<br>coming here so that was a big push for<br>me to come here as well yeah I'm really<br>alright so um if there could be if you<br>wish that there was one thing that<br>someone would have told you about uni<br>when you were in year 13 oh that thing a<br>burn if you wish that you could know<br>something before you rocked up here on<br>what I found and what I wish I'd known<br>more was that University really is a<br>period of extremes in terms of academia<br>you'll have a few weeks where nothing is<br>due and I've blogged about this but I<br>just keep realizing it this week was a<br>big week but um for a few weeks you'll<br>have nothing on and it'll be really<br>relaxed and everything will be fine but<br>in the last week of the half semester<br>it'll all hit you you'll have six things<br>in two days and a bunch of other stuff<br>going on outside of University and so<br>that can be really sort of foggy and<br>stressful and stuff so time management I<br>think would be like a big thing but yet<br>the extremity just be aware of that<br>because with school there are people<br>policing you're you know progress on an<br>assignment but here not so much so if<br>you end up doing you know two<br>assignments the night before and you've<br>got a test the next day it's you know<br>just be prepared for that I would say<br>yeah I think I can as I had yesterday it<br>was no fun but like I think one of the<br>things I wish I got told was you really<br>kind of have to and make an effort to<br>put yourself out there a bit when you<br>come to uni and it's really different<br>from the high school vibe in the sense<br>that you kind of your classes are so<br>small and you kind of you know the same<br>people because you're there with them<br>24/7 and raised lectures are actually<br>quite an antisocial environment you kind<br>of turn up to a lecture you know you<br>might be in there with three four<br>hundred other people you sit down you<br>listen take your notes that you leave<br>people don't stick around people don't<br>you know kind of chair and get friendly<br>most of the time so it's it's really<br>making an effort to take advantage of<br>the clubs the things that they put on<br>there's just so much on offer outside of<br>lectures that you need to take advantage<br>of if you're not living in a hall and to<br>really get the full uni experience I<br>think with myself personally I<br>definitely couldn't have done you need<br>if I hadn't moved into a hall because<br>the environments that they sit out there<br>are just amazing the the friends that<br>I've made are going to be lifelong and<br>just they're they really give you a<br>sense of home as well as having that<br>support system of people to study with<br>for uni or just you know great friends<br>to get away from uni with therefore<br>people who don't live in halls I think<br>you yeah you really need to make an<br>effort to try and see what you're really<br>interested in because there's probably a<br>thousand different clubs there cater to<br>your passions in your talents and so I<br>think you definitely get involved with<br>those and that's your kind of way to<br>network and meet new people because<br>pictures make it really difficult to<br>make friends at uni so really take<br>advantage of those things lucky enough<br>to get a scholarship it covers the cost<br>of staying in a hole so even though I<br>lived 30 minutes away I now live five<br>minutes away which is very amazing<br>because I am a chronically late person I<br>used to live five minutes walking<br>distance from my high school and it was<br>late almost every single day so this was<br>actually great because not only one<br>thing like all I saw all my friends<br>suffering on the one hour bus journey<br>from my house because we don't have like<br>a train station so that was really<br>amazing like I can just rock up to my<br>lectures just waking up like 10 minutes<br>before and especially a labs and stuff I<br>just don't know how I would have<br>survived if I had stayed over<br>and uhm yeah it's been really great like<br>I've made so much new people which I<br>probably wouldn't have originally<br>because I wouldn't have stayed in a hole<br>obviously if I didn't get a scholarship<br>living 30 minutes away because I'm cost<br>wise so like I was kind of like you know<br>pushed in this experience like not by my<br>own choice book because it just happened<br>and I'm actually loving it there any<br>questions that any of you have for any<br>I am part of the drama club this strife<br>theatre company which I know you you<br>love drama so that's really good and<br>that they've got tons of different<br>things lined up for all different kinds<br>of theatrical interests I'm also part of<br>the debating society and within that<br>even if you don't do any debating it's<br>really good for a law degree because<br>they offer specialist little tutorials<br>before big tests and exams not be like<br>look this is how you attack it so the<br>membership is good even just for that<br>perk there are also a few different like<br>sort of activist groups I guess that I'm<br>part of like the campus feminist<br>collective and Thursdays in black so<br>it's really really diverse Club wise for<br>whatever interests you've got there's a<br>meet Club where you can just get free<br>food if you pay a fee at the start of<br>the year and then just rock up yes it's<br>not meeting people like sausage sizzles<br>you know what I mean just sort of have a<br>look at the club's Expo at the start of<br>the year and you'll be bound to find one<br>or ten things that fit you same vibe I'm<br>coming from high school I played a lot<br>of sport and stuff so I joined the like<br>sports things on the touch team I was an<br>associate ball team for a little bit and<br>I also played basketball for the<br>university so you got the sporting side<br>of it I did a Shakespeare play with the<br>Auckland University this year and last<br>year and they got to perform at the<br>pop-up globe very cool<br>that was the tempest last year and then<br>Michael Hirst I think is directing this<br>year's one so yeah he was the he was the<br>gladiator dude and then being a part of<br>a music student I'm also a part of the<br>musical festival that's coming up which<br>people I'm officially so ears above us<br>actually get like marks and grades for<br>it but we are putting on like a full<br>which is like an hour long it's a French<br>opera really intense way we're doing a<br>lot of rehearsals and things like that<br>um but yeah that that's another sort of<br>things that you within your course<br>there's like little like things and<br>opportunities that pop up which could be<br>yes okay yeah um so all my lectures<br>pretty much all last semester they were<br>in the same room and they were like hour<br>after hour after hour so you basically<br>just had to sit there in the same spot<br>for three hours for three lectures so<br>that was fine it was actually in this<br>building most of all your lectures are<br>pretty much an OG GP for first-year bio<br>med and oh we actually know they're in<br>Tamaki - yeah um but um terms of labs<br>like if you're doing a science degree<br>you'll have labs usually for your papers<br>and they can be kind of all over the<br>place depending on the lab like if it's<br>cameras and a science center if it's in<br>if it's a biology lab it's in the<br>biology building<br>it's a mid-sized lab it's in grafton but<br>those are only like once every two weeks<br>for your paper so you don't have to go<br>there like very often so mostly for your<br>lectures you'll be an OT to be a little<br>bit different and that we go to Tamaki<br>campus on Wednesdays and you just catch<br>the free shuttle the free student<br>shuttle and it takes you right to the<br>campus yeah so besides that just like<br>Sanne saying all our lectures are in OGG<br>B and then we just have a few labs<br>Arts degrees suck because they're just<br>put in random rooms yeah like in first<br>year you'll find that because the papers<br>there's a lot of people taking them they<br>tend to be generally in the same places<br>but yeah I find myself kind of running<br>between OG DB and so the general<br>librarian - comma say and Bek and it's<br>yeah it's emulsifoam I take a language<br>as well I took French so sometimes I<br>kind of have to go although I do side of<br>the campus just to get in and so it<br>can't be it can't be a bit of fun that<br>you also realize the campus isn't that<br>big and you find shortcuts and ways to<br>get around it so actually and for law in<br>first year the only time that you go to<br>the law school is for your tutorials the<br>rest of the time your lectures are sort<br>of all around the place but this year<br>yeah so um faculty of Education and<br>Social Work is actually in Epsom so it's<br>not in the city it's about like a 15<br>minute bus ride from where I live which<br>is Grafton um so I didn't realize that<br>my degree was not in the city so I moved<br>to the city and then I found out that my<br>faculty wasn't in the city um it's<br>actually in the it's based in the suburb<br>area so it's like a it's kinda it looks<br>kind of like a high school it's really<br>small the campus is really small but for<br>your general IDI um your general ed will<br>be in the city so from Epsom I have to<br>go to the city so that's I take a bus<br>ride I can't walk but yeah yeah I was<br>saying before I do not regret one bit<br>moving into the halls especially moving<br>cities just to be in a place where<br>obviously no one kind of knew each other<br>to begin with but you just kind of<br>become really close to the people on<br>your floor just the people Newhall and<br>and it's the environment they set up not<br>just the fun and the enjoyment of uni<br>but also there's a really good study<br>environment that's it up like so I live<br>you know both live in uni Hall and it's<br>got in total about five hundred people<br>in it so it can seem quite daunting to<br>begin with because you've got you know<br>you and five other 500 other people<br>there or sharing this place and you<br>don't think that you're kind of gonna<br>make many friends cuz there are too many<br>people but it's totally the opposite<br>I've made so many friends and even<br>people that I'm now going to flit with<br>next year and so that's a really cool<br>thing it was set up for me and none of<br>us are from Auckland as well one of them<br>is even from France so just to even have<br>kind of those connections with people<br>living all around the country and around<br>the world and you kind of wouldn't get<br>that if you're living at home and I know<br>if I was to study in Wellington I wasn't<br>going to be moving into a hall so I<br>would have had to be travelling into uni<br>everyday and back and probably wouldn't<br>have made as many friends just because<br>with lectures being quite difficult but<br>yeah<br>and I could go on and on about how<br>amazing holes are and why you should<br>definitely move into a hole and so if<br>you're thinking about it you will not<br>regret it what I found about the holes<br>is that they're a really good home base<br>because the university is so large it<br>can feel quite daunting as people have<br>said but to go back to an environment<br>that becomes very familiar and in which<br>people do know you on a person-to-person<br>basis is quite encouraging and it always<br>it's you know it's very very comforting<br>one difference between uni hall and<br>O'Rourke which I've quite liked I guess<br>just for me personally is that we have<br>pots so that while it on uni hall it's<br>like corridors and then you share a<br>bathroom and stuff and O'Rourke there's<br>pods where you'll grouped with five to<br>six people and then you share one<br>bathroom between you so you've sort of<br>got a group of people who you're forced<br>to interact with in some capacity so<br>even if you don't really want to meet<br>anyone on your bit scared there are<br>people who are just like right next door<br>so they'll say hello when they pop<br>through and then yeah the whole of the<br>hall and the floor as a whole especially<br>I found you do become really close just<br>because you're in such close quarters so<br>you will find your people sort of within<br>that not everyone has to be your best<br>mate but that the people that you do<br>meet and often the people that you'll<br>put together with on your floor because<br>the RAS<br>organize it very specifically based on<br>Facebook profiles it's very scientific<br>yeah you find the right people and you<br>find good people for you and you find<br>people who understand your values or<br>your work ethic or what you're studying<br>for me personally so I was kind of yeah<br>eyeing up scholarships pretty early just<br>because moving from Gibbon you know lots<br>of money and for me yeah so I was<br>prefect in high school I also did a<br>couple like a few things around the<br>community and stuff like that but um I<br>wouldn't say I specifically went out of<br>my way like I need to do this because I<br>need to apply for the scholarship and I<br>need this kind of you know it was more<br>like I stuck to what I enjoyed I you<br>know like I enjoyed working with the<br>community doing things with my school<br>and stuff like that and when I came to<br>my scholarship applications instead of<br>kind of like thinking oh I haven't done<br>enough done enough that I kind of just<br>thought what have I done in how can I<br>really accentuate that and my<br>scholarship applications because I think<br>that's really what it's about it's just<br>finding your you know knowing yourself<br>knowing your own talents and being like<br>this is awesome I can write a really<br>good scholarship application and yeah<br>just just running with it like if you<br>don't feel comfortable putting yourself<br>out there for some reason like trying to<br>do things for a scholarship application<br>that's fine it's just more about<br>I wasn't a prefect or anything I<br>actually didn't even know I kind of<br>forgot scholarships existed until like<br>that until the Oakland uni like guy came<br>over to our school and he was like<br>scholarship applications are open and I<br>was like oh my god so I decided to apply<br>so in that sense we prepared because I<br>only knew like a month before and<br>probably did my scholarship application<br>like a week before but I'm basically I<br>think the main thing I didn't really<br>know and I wish I kind of knew about<br>scholarships is like for the academic<br>aspect of the scholarship they actually<br>only look at like your year 12 so you<br>kind of can relax but yet that team if<br>that's the thing but um yeah you just<br>have to UM I was just like involved in a<br>few things but um yeah kind of just came<br>up at that point when I found out about<br>it because scholarships get offered<br>before students appear interviewer exams<br>so we thanks all scholarships on the<br>grades their students achieve in year 12<br>and that's just the way that the<br>scholarships work really look at what<br>you want to do and things like that<br>because there is like little hidden<br>scholarships on the way so I applied for<br>a scholarship when I was in year 12 to<br>get that like sort of trailer like<br>preview year 13 and experience for<br>university and that was something that<br>we wouldn't have found out we came to an<br>event here at the music block and this<br>teacher was like hey have a look at it<br>also like really like it's not gonna lie<br>like the University of Auckland website<br>is a little bit like of a maze it's a<br>little bit tricky but if you really like<br>by yeah if you dive into it and like<br>really look for scholarships oh I'm<br>mouldy so I came through on the multi<br>academic excellence scholarship which<br>required grades and also like<br>relatability to your Turkana and stuff<br>like that so I came through on on that<br>level but I wouldn't have known about<br>there unless I'd gone through and worked<br>out what I couldn't and things like that<br>also I'm just on a completely other note<br>for you guys um apply like just go for<br>it<br>my really good friend who was hid boy at<br>my school applied for a like<br>let like just a shot in the dark at<br>Melbourne University because his brother<br>was over there and he didn't really know<br>what he was gonna do he he got like<br>applied for here and got into Auckland<br>but at the very last minute he spun<br>around and got that Melbourne<br>scholarship and it was worth because his<br>family and his brother were living over<br>in Melbourne and stuff so it was a good<br>opportunity for him to go over there and<br>study accounting and things like their<br>economics so just little things like<br>that you definitely should apply if you<br>if you don't know like I maybe I don't<br>know if I'll get this all cleaned<br>academic excellence scholarship or<br>whatever just give it a go you never<br>know so yeah the q''-word scholarships<br>is if you apply you might and if you<br>don't apply you learnt so there you go<br>they odds are better if you apply what<br>be yourself<br>that sounds really generic but you're<br>going to if you do get the position and<br>get a blogging role you will have to<br>sustain that for an entire year so you<br>know giving your genuine advice to a<br>group of people who are you know going<br>to be in a very similar situation to you<br>is very important so don't go and sort<br>of being like ah this is what we might<br>want or this is what we think is right<br>just sort of going with it be authentic<br>because you're the one who's going to<br>have to carry your project if you are<br>successful just take pictures<br>entry-level thing or do a little video<br>wink-wink nudge-nudge well last year I<br>had 130 applications and I had to choose<br>10 and so the team that got chosen were<br>based on they it was good grammar like<br>interesting content photos good<br>formatting and M videos as well like if<br>you can<br>it's just think if you if you want to be<br>if you want to be a blogger and I<br>encourage everyone to apply to be a<br>blogger because it's a it's a pretty fun<br>gig I hope you'll agree the but it's it<br>really is something that will really a<br>fit it really affects students who read<br>it and and so because of that students<br>that view it also need to find it<br>interesting not I mean if it's just a<br>big page of blank text and it's poorly<br>formatted and is spelling errors I'm<br>gonna look at it and be like well is<br>that the kind of stuff that this person<br>is going to produce for the rest of next<br>year and so that goes in the maybe pile<br>where as these people went into the<br>different @ pile and then uhm that's why<br>yeah the questions not yet who will be<br>eventually so I'm one quick thing I have<br>a bit of an interest in is beaker sauna<br>tell us a little about the differences<br>between biomed and health science like<br>why did you choose one over the other<br>okay um I chose biomed instead of health<br>science because for health science as<br>I'm aware you need to take a table a<br>subject in high school which is like a<br>English based kind of subject and I hate<br>English so I as soon as I could drop<br>English in year 13 I dropped it and I<br>just went the triple science double Matt<br>threw it and so I basically didn't<br>really meet the requirements to get into<br>health science so I just decided to go<br>the biomed route and I also really loved<br>science as well so hath science just<br>seemed really perfect for me and yeah<br>and I also really liked the look of the<br>population health papers because they<br>kind of dealt with issues that I was<br>kind of interested in like for example<br>we have a paper and it's about how<br>systems and it's just about looking at<br>the different health systems around the<br>world and how they operate and kind of<br>the pros and cons of them which I<br>thought was really interesting<br>and it also population health and those<br>kind of papers also deal heavily with<br>inequities and kind of how society is<br>moving at the moment in terms of health<br>which I thought was really cool and yeah<br>that's why I chose earth science instead<br>of I mean yeah I think the important<br>thing to like realize is that in the<br>first year if you're going like the mid<br>route health science and bio made like<br>only differ by three papers so like<br>they're pretty similar so I mean yeah<br>we only had we had so we have four<br>papers each semester and in first<br>semester we our needs differed by one<br>page yeah yeah and then in those papers<br>that differ health ends ones are more<br>like essay assignments and lights<br>whereas by mid ones don't have any<br>essays or assignments fantastic well<br>thank you very much team we are at a<br>time so but thank you everyone for<br>attending we've got another session in<br>the afternoon if you have any more<br>questions otherwise one oh wait laughing<br>thank you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
