accurate.</p><p>well I think thank you very much Dean<br>Stockley and thank you very much<br>everybody for coming along it's it's a<br>great privilege and as I've said it<br>various times to the Woodhouse family<br>and it's great to see so many friends<br>from that family here tonight it's well<br>it's a great privilege it's also a<br>rather daunting one when I think of that<br>person whom I got to know really well I<br>learned I've learned a great deal from<br>various mentors over my life and times<br>and for more than 50 years<br>owen Woodhouse was a major mentor and<br>indeed he continues to be I still think<br>about his talents whenever I'm trying to<br>think something through or trying to put<br>words on a page he emphasized the<br>importance of getting the question right<br>he emphasized the importance of getting<br>the facts right of seeking out the<br>relevant values policies and principles<br>and balancing them when when necessary<br>and of the ongoing assessment he was<br>also very insistent that we have ongoing<br>assessment of changes in the law to see<br>just what impact that has had also<br>characteristics were clear thinking<br>clear writing getting the first sentence<br>right they were critical as well and and<br>so too was the international and<br>comparative material what could we learn<br>from elsewhere what lessons were there<br>to be learned from elsewhere I think I<br>was having a discussion with Geoffrey<br>Palmer about the timing of this last<br>night in terms of who first came across<br>sir Owen Jeffery at that time was a<br>graduate student in Chicago and when Sir<br>Owen came partly because one of his co<br>commissioners had children at the<br>University of Chicago but also because<br>they wanted to meet up with him and was<br>Kelvin who was doing work on no-fault<br>motor vehicle recovery and so it's not<br>exactly clear who of the two of us first<br>mid Owen I met him in the library which<br>some of you may recall the law library<br>at the back of Pembridge and I see<br>Pembridge today as surrounded must be<br>getting rebuilt and and Jack Northey<br>introduced me to the judge who was just<br>starting out on his royal commission and<br>it was the first time I'd ever had a<br>substantive discussion with a judge he<br>was really interested in what this young<br>man well I must have been getting near<br>230 I think had to had to say and I<br>think he also said it would be a good<br>idea if people within the faculty took<br>an interest in his royal commission now<br>I'm sure that he did say the same thing<br>to call an ikemen who was then the Dean<br>at Victoria and as I'll mention later<br>that led to a number of thus appearing<br>now you've got a number of names if you<br>can see them on the screen behind me and<br>I'll move through a number of different<br>topics but I'm talking about various<br>places of peril and danger they they<br>present themselves all the time and to<br>mention some that I'm not going to<br>discuss consider the Korean Peninsula<br>right at the moment the 2004 Indian<br>Ocean and 2011 Fukushima is quakes and<br>tsunami the war famine and cholera<br>epidemic threatening two million Yemenis<br>the storm in flooding and Texas and a<br>much more extensive flooding in<br>Bangladesh India and Nepal in which it<br>is reported that 1,200 have died<br>now as I say tonight I won't get into<br>those matters but it is those are<br>matters in which law has some part to<br>play but inadequately at the moment not<br>enough has been done in those in respect<br>of those matters but I will be<br>considering dangers and perils at work<br>dangers and perils at sea and about<br>on the battlefield and then after going<br>through those three I'll come back to<br>the ACC scheme and its extent and its<br>extension and raise some issues at that<br>point now if I begin in terms of timing<br>back in 1897 if I may it's it's a time<br>when labor law was getting established<br>and serious ways in New Zealand it's six<br>years after true gear whose name was on<br>the on the wall behind me Edward trigger<br>was appointed as the first secretary for<br>labor in New Zealand and the chief<br>inspector of factories another name that<br>I picked from that time as France Kafka<br>this may be a bit of a surprise but he<br>was a brilliant young lawyer and he was<br>appointed in that year to the workers<br>accident Insurance Institute of the<br>kingdom of Bohemia and Prague in that<br>year 1897 there's a very good lengthy<br>article in the Journal of the Society of<br>comparative legislation by Walter Gorst<br>clay barrister of the inner temple and<br>it's about the law of employers<br>liability and insurance against<br>accidents sadly that journal no longer<br>exists<br>we need more comparative study of<br>legislation although I noticed that the<br>Chief Justice recently cited to it but<br>from the 1930s I think now in his very<br>first sentence and that again goes back<br>to a point I made about Sir Owen mr.<br>Gerst clay sees the existing law of<br>imply employers liability as being based<br>on to essentially distinct principles<br>the first was compensation for a wrong<br>and indemnity against apparel<br>compensation for a wrong the first had<br>been developed by the courts the second<br>by legislators<br>he was able to state the issue<br>succinctly in that way because he had<br>studied the law and particularly the<br>legislation of 51 different<br>jurisdictions he also looked at some of<br>the practice he looked at the United<br>Kingdom and many of its colonies many of<br>the states of the United States for 15<br>European states and he gave particular<br>attention to the German law of insurance<br>against accidents which have been<br>adopted in 1884 during Chancellor Otto<br>von Bismarck long reign that law he<br>considered was probably the most<br>successful part of social legislation<br>undertaken in Germany at that time in<br>the light of that review which just<br>predated the first workers compensation<br>act in the UK and and predated the New<br>Zealand one by three years 1900 was the<br>date of ours course clay recorded and<br>he's still on the first of his 111 pages<br>that the conviction appeared to be<br>growing to be gaining ground that the<br>law idea of like employers Liability the<br>court made law should be abandoned<br>altogether and the problem of work<br>accident should be seen as essentially<br>one of putting on a sound economic basis<br>a portion of the necessary taxation of<br>the state that is by legislation he<br>elaborated the reason for that<br>preference in these terms for as the<br>care of the injured workman and the<br>support of those whom were he uninjured<br>he would have to maintain fall in the<br>last resort upon the state it is the<br>duty of the state to provide that the<br>funds required for the discharge of thus<br>liability shall be raised in an<br>equitable manner from among its subjects<br>so he was looking to sharing of the risk<br>and doing it in an equitable manner and<br>he was looking to taxation as was<br>happening in many parts of continental<br>Europe a similar appeal to community<br>responsibilities to think of the first<br>principle in the wood house report<br>appeared in the following year in New<br>Zealand and the preamble to the old-age<br>pensions act of 1898 Parliament declared<br>that it was equitable that word again<br>that deserving persons who during their<br>prime of life have helped to bear the<br>public burden of the colony by the<br>payment of taxes and to open up its<br>resources by their labor and skill<br>should receive a pension in their old<br>age mr. goose Clay's paper in its second<br>page focuses on a matter which he saw as<br>essentially separate from compensation<br>for work injury that matter was the<br>precautions to be taken against<br>accidents through state regulation<br>supported by the enforcement of penal<br>provisions requiring the taking of care<br>the legislation he reviews shows that<br>that distinction between looking after<br>the injured on the one side or the<br>family of the dead worker on the other<br>was quite that that was distinct from<br>the business of proper safety and<br>regulation and enforcement even although<br>the proposition that tort liability for<br>negligence would help promote safe<br>systems of work was to be heard over<br>much of the following century the<br>rejection of that proposition or at<br>least its very limited role had long<br>been reflected and the imposition of<br>distinct obligations on the operators of<br>factories mines ships shops and offices<br>many obligations to protect their<br>workers consider the great efforts of<br>Shaftesbury and McCauley<br>in the middle of the 19th century that<br>law supported by an inspector in<br>criminal liability is to be found in New<br>Zealand legislation dating back to at<br>least 1846 publication of 1896 by Edward<br>trigger brings together that legislation<br>and shows that that lengthy period for<br>the new colony a publication a decade or<br>two later to introduced an international<br>Element would have included legislation<br>designed to give effect to the first<br>International labor conventions adopted<br>in 1906 they prohibited the use of white<br>phosphorus in the match industry and<br>night work for women employed an<br>industry and an early sign that<br>employers were willing to take on such<br>obligations who were willing to do that<br>wish to be protected by treaty from<br>foreign employers who would otherwise be<br>free of such obligations that argument<br>of foreign cheating was one which Samuel<br>plimsoll had already had to deal with<br>and getting his essential safety measure<br>protecting seafarers established the<br>preambles to those early treaties<br>referred accordingly to the desire of<br>the parties to facilitate the protection<br>of work people by the adoption of common<br>provisions now I've so far mentioned<br>several notable individuals including<br>lawyers and legislation in treaties but<br>not the courts accept very incidentally<br>the progear publication like that of<br>course clay does both include the<br>employers Liability Act from 1882<br>through to the 1890s those acts chipped<br>away at the extraordinary 1837 decision<br>of Lord AB injure and his fellow barons<br>and Priestley and Fowler and now it's<br>interesting for me for a number of<br>reasons and I trust it's of some<br>interest to you to go back to that case<br>by the time in 1837 by that time the<br>common law judges had established that<br>an individual was responsible for his<br>own fault and and and could be as well<br>vicarious liability to a third person<br>for their servants negligent conduct and<br>the course of that employment but what<br>of the case presented by Baron ebinger<br>and his colleagues of physical harm<br>caused by the negligent conduct<br>of 1/7 to another could the master be<br>held liable to the into the injured<br>servant the case said the Barons was<br>unprecedented we are therefore to decide<br>the question upon general principles and<br>in doing so we are Liberty to look at<br>the consequences of a decision - one way<br>or the other the judgment continues with<br>these hypotheticals all concerned with<br>transportation but transportation of a<br>particular kind if the master be liable<br>to the servant in this action they said<br>the principle of that liability will be<br>found to caring to carry us to an<br>alarming extent it's the kind of<br>sentence that I don't think judges<br>should be in the habit of writing he who<br>is responsible by this general duty will<br>by the terms of his contract for all the<br>consequences of negligence in a matter<br>in which he is the principle as<br>responsible and here's the particular<br>type of Transportation is responsible<br>for the negligence of his coach maker of<br>his harness maker for his coachman the<br>footman therefore who rides behind the<br>carriage may have an action against his<br>master for a defect in the carriage<br>owing to the negligence of the harvest<br>maker or for drunkenness neglect or want<br>of skill and the coachman nor is there<br>any reason why the principal should not<br>if applicable in this class of cases<br>extend to many others and the court<br>continues with suggested liabilities and<br>in respect of other classes of domestic<br>servants the chambermaid the upholsterer<br>the cook the butcher and the Builder and<br>throughout the word used as servant not<br>an employee or worker the court<br>essentially concluded the case against<br>the injured servant in this case with<br>this assessment the inconvenience not to<br>say the<br>absurdity of these consequences afford a<br>sufficient argument against the<br>application of this principle to the<br>present case and that largely unreasoned<br>an unprincipled way the common servant<br>doctrine or fellow employment rule was<br>established with serious consequences<br>getting in the way of injured workers in<br>many parts of the common-law world it's<br>striking that in 1939 or fully 100 years<br>later the House of Lords while finding<br>that the doctrine was based on personal<br>apprehension rather than on principle<br>and that they quote there were none to<br>praise in very future Lovett held that<br>the doctrine could not be overthrown by<br>judicial decision it was too<br>long-established they said and Lord<br>Atkin was one of those judges and it's<br>interesting to compare what he had said<br>just a few years earlier right in the<br>middle of the depression in respect of<br>the snail and the bottle and the case of<br>Donohue and Stevenson now it's important<br>to sir Owen would have insisted to look<br>at some of the real facts at that time<br>this is 1837 at that time ahead they<br>thought about right the railways they<br>might have taken account of the fact<br>that railway construction and operations<br>in the UK were developing rapidly that<br>were already about 500 miles of track<br>and up to 900 workers who can hardly be<br>thought of as servants serving along<br>with other servants in the household<br>thinking back to the various categories<br>of servants bérenger mentioned further<br>as an effect and cause of Railways<br>development came big increases in mining<br>and metallurgy and the use of the blast<br>furnace the rapidly developing<br>industrial revolution with its manifold<br>dangers to the increasing numbers of<br>industrial workers and the resulting<br>serious injury appear to have passed the<br>Barons by you will I hope agree with my<br>assessment that that ruling was<br>ordinary both as a matter of principle<br>and fact now I now move to a second<br>place of peril of danger dangers at sea<br>as I said at the beginning I'll come<br>back to work accidents the workplace the<br>ACCC scheme and its scope<br>Edward true gear included among his<br>collection of Labor legislation that<br>which gave particular protections to<br>seafarers for at least six centuries<br>national legislation or national<br>practice had required masters of ships<br>to go to the aid of those in distress at<br>sea that obligation took general treaty<br>form only in 1910 and it was included in<br>New Zealand shipping legislation a few<br>years later it's the legislation said a<br>master or person in charge of a ship<br>shelled so far as you can do so without<br>serious danger to his own ship their<br>crew and passengers render assistance to<br>every person even subjects of foreign<br>States at war with his majesty who was<br>found at sea in danger of being lost and<br>if he fails to do that he commits a<br>crime now that obligation has been<br>accompanied by a quid pro quo since at<br>least 1566 in that year pope pius v and<br>calling on fishing vessels to come to<br>the aid of those in peril provided the<br>balance payment should be made to those<br>who took that action<br>now some law and economics scholars and<br>addressing this area of law failed to<br>mention the legislation and the treaties<br>it seems they're not interested in the<br>written law they put the matter<br>essentially in economic terms in terms<br>of economic incentives but surely as a<br>great French law of the sea expert has<br>put it the ideas of humanity at the base<br>of the 1910 convention are above Aldous<br>discussion the obligation of assistance<br>is demanded by humanity a word that will<br>occur quite often and this address it's<br>a word that Owen often used and thinking<br>and writing about injury prevention<br>rehabilitation and compensation that<br>humanitarian demand appears to be often<br>ignored who think solely in terms of the<br>market in zero-sum games think of all<br>the actions of good citizenship being<br>displayed right at the moment and<br>Houston and no doubt and Bangladesh and<br>so on where so many are in peril if not<br>at sea certainly in very deep water and<br>and who I imagine are not contemplating<br>that the will be a quid pro quo they're<br>doing just the humanitarian duty now I<br>come to my thirty area though and it is<br>an obligation of assistance to those in<br>distress on the battlefield in 1859 at<br>sulfur II no we do not a Swiss citizen<br>who was hoping to get Napoleon to assist<br>him in financing a development in<br>Algeria Honore do not finding this<br>massive casualty rate after that awful<br>battle arranged instead not not a loan<br>from the Emperor but he arranged succor<br>to the casualties and their many<br>thousands he proceeded on the basis of<br>two T Fratelli we are all brothers no<br>Lyon was to be drawn between friend and<br>foe his efforts led along with efforts<br>of others of his compatriots to the<br>formation in 1863 of what became the<br>International Committee of the Red Cross<br>and the adoption in 1864 of the first<br>Geneva Convention for the amelioration<br>of the sick and wounded in the field it<br>provided for the protection as neutral<br>of hospitals and ambulances and of those<br>who work there it also protected<br>houses which were taking care of the<br>wounded further the generals were<br>tuition an appeal to the inhabitants to<br>their humanity to help to bring help to<br>the wounded those who did so will where<br>to remain free it will not surprise you<br>that the very first of the fundamental<br>principles of the International Red<br>Cross and Red Crescent movement as<br>humanity and that the law of arms or the<br>law of war or the law of armed conflict<br>is now commonly referred to as<br>international humanitarian law<br>now another name that I have from the<br>1860's as Florence Nightingale<br>she was flatly opposed to do nots ideas<br>of having national Red Cross societies<br>she saw their responsibilities or the<br>responsibilities suggested for them as<br>belonging to governments alone<br>government should not be able to get rid<br>of those obligations by having these<br>voluntary organizations she failed at<br>net opposition as is demonstrated by the<br>fact that there are now nearly 190<br>national Red Cross societies around the<br>world national rechristened societies<br>but she was much more successful and<br>this is a much more important part of<br>her contribution she is much more<br>successful in insisting on accurate<br>statistics she collected the facts about<br>military deaths and she was able to show<br>by looking at them that it was more<br>dangerous to be in the barracks in the<br>British Army than it was to be in the<br>battlefield and the Crimea she<br>demonstrated this very effectively<br>envision visually by using pie charts<br>one of the first people to use pie<br>charts and and those charts were not<br>just descriptive they were also<br>prescriptive she was in the business of<br>persuading the government to improve<br>military hygiene she took on the army<br>top brass and was successful in that<br>endeavor just a week ago the Australian<br>government scientists declared that she<br>should she should be known not as the<br>lady with the lamp I have it on good<br>authority that she was not a very good<br>nurse but she should be known as the<br>lady with the logarithm or the patrons<br>of patron saint of mathematicians that<br>government chief government scientists<br>drew several lessons from her life the<br>first was that mathematics was critical<br>to our lives and societies and and the<br>last was that evidence was to be used to<br>make a difference instancing health care<br>policy Florence Nightingale<br>correspondent with a great number of<br>people including Sir George Gray and as<br>part of the correspondence is about<br>lessons to be drawn from the first New<br>Zealand census again she suggested how<br>in New Zealand hygiene among Maori<br>populations might be improved and one of<br>her letters to gray she said you will do<br>a noble work in New Zealand I think it<br>was about the time he was coming back<br>from Cape Colony to New Zealand you will<br>do a noble work in New Zealand but pray<br>think of your statistics and the word<br>statistics began with the capital S now<br>in 1960 again in 1863 came the first<br>detailed statement of the laws of war it<br>has at its core humanity competing with<br>military necessity it as general orders<br>100 issued by President Lincoln for the<br>armies of the north and that very<br>destructive Civil War<br>Francis Lieber prepared that text he was<br>a real polymath he also had sons on both<br>sides of the battle and and he spelled<br>out a very detailed text including a ban<br>on waterboarding it's not something<br>that's a new that Ben at the same time<br>well the following year 1864 there were<br>principles stated in much shorter form<br>for the battle at<br>and at Gate Park they were stated on the<br>Maori side by hen are a teratoma and in<br>which in that in that battle there were<br>250 night irani warriors and they<br>defeated a British force of almost 2,000<br>those laws provided that unarmed<br>soldiers were to be saved as were the<br>wounded or captured and soldiers who<br>flee to the house of a priest and I'm<br> ha women and children were also to<br>be spared<br>now that body of law has been greatly<br>elaborated over the following 150 years<br>and it's been extended beyond the field<br>to the to the shipwrecked and people at<br>sea and difficulty to prisoners of war<br>in 1929 and in 1949 a date which is<br>significant to civilians and occupied<br>territory further changes were made in<br>the 1970s to develop the law and respect<br>of internal armed conflict methods and<br>means of warfare which had not been<br>addressed since 1907 and improved<br>methods of implementation now one of the<br>principles that has been carried forward<br>all the way since 1899 and it's included<br>in one of those 1977 texts is what is<br>known as the des Martin's formula a<br>formula drafted by Frederick D Martins<br>who was a leading Russian well some<br>would say Estonian international lawyer<br>and one of the principal negotiators in<br>The Hague and 1899 and 1907 the latest<br>version says in cases not covered by<br>this protocol or other international<br>agreements civilians and competence<br>remain under the protection and<br>authority of the principles of<br>international law derived from<br>established cancer custom from the<br>principles of humanity and from the<br>dictates of the public conscience in<br>1996 the International Court of Justice<br>spoke spoke very strongly in support of<br>that clause<br>they said they<br>Court said the continuing and existence<br>and applicability of their Clause was<br>not to be doubted and it was an<br>affirmation that the principles and<br>rules of humanitarian law applied to<br>nuclear weapons and saying that the<br>court rejected the arguments made by the<br>Russian Federation and the United States<br>among others now there are obviously<br>terrible breaches of this body of law<br>and a good deal of cases of successful<br>application which don't get the same<br>press I just want to touch on one matter<br>which has been prominent recently and<br>I'll do this quickly it's a matter that<br>about which there's been a good deal of<br>controversy it relates to the resolution<br>adopted late last year by the Security<br>Council relating to the Middle East it<br>was adopted on 23 December last year in<br>the last days of new zealand's<br>membership of the Security Council New<br>Zealand the New Zealand action and<br>co-sponsoring it and voting for it has<br>been criticized now and and has been the<br>subject of much ill-informed comment<br>including by the recently appointed<br>foreign minister and his first few days<br>back in May now New Zealand voted in<br>favor along with 13 other members<br>including France Japan Spain and the<br>United Kingdom and the United States as<br>is well known abstained now I make four<br>points about it very briefly the<br>resolution first reaffirmed that the<br>occupied Palestinian territories were<br>subject to the Fourth Geneva Convention<br>of 1949 concerning the protection of<br>civilians and armed conflict and that<br>convention includes a prohibition on<br>civilian settlements in occupied<br>territory second that position of<br>prohibition on civilian settlements had<br>been taken by the legal adviser to the<br>Israeli forum<br>as long ago as November 1967 just a few<br>months after the June war and it was<br>taken unanimously by the International<br>Court of Justice in 2004 third to<br>counter the argument that the resolution<br>was unbalanced that the resolution<br>condemned all acts of violence against<br>civilians called for immediate steps to<br>end them and called upon the parties to<br>act on the basis of international law my<br>final point about that event about that<br>resolution is that the Fourth Convention<br>was actually in draft before World War<br>two it was to be the subject of a<br>diplomatic conference in 1940 not very<br>good timing<br>the ICRC commentary to their convention<br>says this about the delay<br>and it's very cautious ICRC writing as<br>the renowned for that caution the events<br>of World War two they say show the<br>disastrous consequences of the absence<br>of a convention for the protection of<br>victims in warfare so a strong a strong<br>statement the disastrous consequences of<br>which we're all pretty well aware now<br>let me come back to the business of work<br>injuries and and beyond I'd go back<br>again into the late 19th century and<br>partly as a link to the reference on the<br>overhead behind me to the International<br>Labor Organization the bodies that were<br>set up in continental Europe the one<br>that Franz Kafka was involved with for<br>instance had very interesting functions<br>and composition the German associations<br>are noise in Austria were formed by<br>groups of employers within a particular<br>industry their boards had equal<br>as of employer and worker delegates they<br>had large powers of self management and<br>they had two different functions as you<br>might have guessed they first of all<br>were involved in setting and gathering<br>the premiums from the employers and<br>making decisions on compensation for<br>work injuries and deaths on a no-fault<br>basis and second they had the role of<br>proposing regulations to promote safety<br>in the particular industry they had the<br>function of appointing inspectors and<br>the function of enforcing the<br>regulations against employers and<br>workers in the event of breach the<br>exercise of these important powers was<br>subject to supervision and epaulette<br>control by common by government<br>insurance officers kafka to come back to<br>him was a very senior member of such an<br>office and pract the capital of the<br>kingdom of Bohemia which was then known<br>as the Manchester of the<br>austro-hungarian Empire was a great<br>recent book about Kafka in which his<br>office writings have been translated<br>with some really interesting commentary<br>and you find him dealing with businesses<br>which were trying to get into a less<br>expensive risk category you find him<br>resolving particular compensation claims<br>on an appeal you find him trying to<br>improve safety standards for instance in<br>quarries some of you may remember how<br>Joseph Kay came to his death by being<br>stabbed at Anna quarry and in the trial<br>and after 1914 he was becoming<br>increasingly concerned as well with the<br>rehabilitation of the many servicemen<br>wounded in the great war and the<br>establishment of psychiatric hospitals<br>for them slightly McCabe to notice that<br>one of the psychiatric hospitals was<br>prepared proposed for the town of<br>Frankenstein now the composition of<br>these associations can be linked I think<br>to what happened when the International<br>Labour Organization was<br>established in 1919 at Versailles but<br>the Treaty of Versailles doesn't have a<br>very good name but the International<br>Labor Organization was one of its major<br>products that Constitution provides for<br>a tripartite representation each of the<br>now 187 members of the International<br>Labor Organization as represented at the<br>conference which adopts international<br>labor conventions now to almost 200 of<br>them though those delegations have to<br>government delegates one employer<br>delegate and one worker delegate and and<br>the governing body the executive body is<br>similarly composed those responsible for<br>the preparation of the that chapter of<br>the Treaty of Versailles and for the<br>setting up of the organization justified<br>it in this way Universal and lasting<br>peace can be established only if it is<br>based upon social justice and conditions<br>of labor at that stage exist involving<br>such injustice hardship and privation to<br>large numbers of people so as to produce<br>unrest so great that the peace and<br>harmony of the world are imperiled and<br>an improvement of these conditions is<br>urgently required no doubt they had very<br>clearly in mind what had happened in<br>Russia just less than two years earlier<br>and what was happening in terms of<br>social and economic turmoil across the<br>whole of Europe they the drafters set<br>out a non-exhaustive list of areas in<br>which improvements might and we required<br>they also set out general principles and<br>one of these principles it's really<br>striking to read when you think it's<br>nearly a hundred years ago one of these<br>principles was that men and women should<br>receive equal remuneration for work of<br>equal value so you know there you had<br>their propositions stateand way back<br>then and we're still even in New Zealand<br>a long way from achieving that they also<br>as with the early to earlier labor<br>conventions I mentioned made the point<br>that they had to be international<br>regulation of labor conditions because<br>the failure of any nation to adopt<br>humane conditions of labor as an<br>obstacle in the way of other nations<br>which desire to improve the conditions<br>in their own countries if the Dutch were<br>to prohibit the use of children and<br>mines they might be worried that the<br>Belgians would get ahead of them but if<br>they were all bound by the same treaty<br>obligation that wouldn't happen now<br>those principles are developed and that<br>mechanism developed was reassessed in<br>1944 it's interesting to see these<br>things happening in the middle of<br>warfare in Philadelphia when the<br>International Labour conference met with<br>President Roosevelt in attendance and<br>and the conference was under the<br>chairmanship of Walter Nash the only<br>other New Zealand minister who has<br>chaired the International labor<br>conferences Jim Bulger and so two<br>significant contributions and they set<br>out the fundamental principles which<br>include the proposition that labor is<br>not a commodity an idea that was<br>challenged really by the very use of the<br>word contracts and the employment<br>contracts Act it's labor is not a<br>commodity and there are various other<br>important principles stated there and<br>and you can relate them back to<br>Roosevelt's Four Freedoms the Atlantic<br>Charter and Declaration of 1942 and and<br>and also if you want more detail go to<br>William Beveridge its report in 1942<br>leading to major social reform in the<br>United Kingdom beverage had as as part<br>of his first principle and the<br>proposition that a revolutionary moment<br>in the world world's history is a time<br>for revolutions<br>not for patching a revolutionary moment<br>in world's history is a time for<br>revolutions not for patching now the<br>International Labour Organization under<br>the enthusiastic leadership of Albert<br>Thomas its first director adopted a<br>great number of conventions New Zealand<br>had no interest at all in the ILO just<br>as it had almost no interest in the<br>League of Nations until 1935 and the<br>election of the first Labour government<br>in 1938 and New Zealand became party to<br>21 international labor conventions<br>including three relating to workers<br>compensation now in terms of workers<br>compensation I should go back to 1900 or<br>slightly earlier 1900 the year wing<br>Workers Compensation Act was passed with<br>the first time and just before that was<br>the disaster in the Brunner mine in 1896<br>that killed all 65 men - working there<br>they left 39 widows and 192 children as<br>well as an elderly dependents I'm<br>grateful to Hazel Armstrong for some of<br>this material I should say the funds<br>available from a government of post<br>Le'Veon coal production in from the<br>friendly societies formed through the<br>miners yuna's unions were not adequate<br>to cover the costs of such tragedies and<br>in the 1900 Act was passed in<br>substantial part as a consequence now a<br>great deal has been written about the<br>periods from 1900 on to New Zealand and<br>I'm not going to head to it tonight and<br>indeed time as passing but there have<br>been all the were all these debates up<br>to the 1960s and 1970s they're written<br>up very well by a great number of people<br>including Hazel's as I just Hayes was<br>writing as I just said also a very good<br>book by Ian Campbell who was a long time<br>senior member of the Workers<br>Compensation Board staff and by Geoffrey<br>Palmer<br>and and I would expect that in future<br>lectures in the and the series and and<br>the associated symposiums some of that<br>experience will be reviewed in a wider<br>context as Cerrone would have wished but<br>if I could just go back again to the<br>reference I made earlier to Owen talking<br>to Colin Eichmann and and this does go<br>to the point about close relationships<br>within our society between the<br>universities and and many others Colin<br>reported to us at morning tea one day<br>that he'd had this conversation with the<br>judge it wouldn't it be a good idea to<br>for us to make submissions and four of<br>us did<br>Colin Ivor Richardson Peter McKenzie and<br>I and and it was great last night<br>to have Peter in the audience and for<br>him to correct one or two other things<br>aren't said now apart from the social<br>world welfare department that group of<br>four was the only group the only<br>submission only set of submissions<br>arguing for a universal scheme Colin<br>made a good argument that the final<br>phrase routinely put into Royal<br>Commission<br>terms of reference was wide enough for<br>the Commission to go widely as of course<br>it did now in terms of my own thinking<br>and my we talked about this a number of<br>us and a 2003 conference I was<br>influenced by the teaching and legal<br>system which began with Priestley and<br>Fowler I was aware of the inadequate and<br>chauncey law common law and legislative<br>remedies a matter which had been<br>emphasized by Terence Ison's recent book<br>the forensic Lottery influenced by the<br>preamble to the Social Security Act of<br>1938 and and so on also influenced by<br>the ILO conventions in respect of which<br>New Zealand was in breach because of the<br>six year time limit for compensation in<br>New Zealand also the beverage report was<br>important to my thinking now I just take<br>three lessons from the last 50 years of<br>debates since the report was published<br>the first concerns the questions to be<br>asked and answered<br>the 1967 report like the 1897 article a<br>distinguished prevention of injury from<br>rehabilitation and compensation next in<br>capacity in terms of widening the<br>question in capacity should not be<br>limited to injuries at work nor indeed<br>to workers be in the position that was<br>taken by Parliament after the change of<br>government in 1972 and principle the<br>scheme should include incapacity for it<br>it could include should include<br>incapacity caused by illness the subject<br>watch which was the subject of study<br>including careful costings<br>submissions and proposals in the law<br>commission made by the law commission in<br>the late 1980s but unfortunately that's<br>their page it to be be taken principle<br>just cannot justify the distinction that<br>was drawn between the entitlements of<br>those who lose the league in a car<br>accident and those who lose their league<br>to cancer and it's encouraging that that<br>matter is still being as back on the<br>agenda and being pursued so one issue<br>was trying to work out the right<br>questions and just seeing how principle<br>applies once you take in that case a<br>wider view a second lesson yet again is<br>about taking the facts seriously that's<br>the subtitle of an excellent 1996 book<br>by three Canadian scholars one of whom<br>is also a New Zealander<br>they reviewed the evidence largely from<br>North America of the efficiency of the<br>tort system and its alternatives<br>relating to automobile accidents medical<br>accidents product related accidents<br>environmental injury and workplace<br>injury<br>they said they wish to move away from<br>the theoretical debates about the<br>appropriate normative goals of the tort<br>system and the doctrinal implications of<br>each entails the tort system they<br>conclude cannot successfully achieve all<br>three of their got the goals they<br>identified deterrence compensation and<br>corrective justice the empirical<br>evidence leads them to a bleak judgment<br>that's their words about the tort system<br>as a compensator a mechanism now that<br>that conclusion had of course already<br>been reached by the Royal Commission in<br>1967 and by the Law Commission in 1988<br>we were greatly helped to take the 1988<br>exercise by many submissions 1698<br>and by the work of expert consultant<br>showing the great failure of<br>interdisciplinary work we had Ian<br>Campbell whom I mentioned earlier who<br>completed an excellent PhD and published<br>a book on the whole matter in his late<br>seventies I listened to many of us<br>perhaps so he had in we had professor<br>Liz Cassell an underlying economic and<br>public policy principles he ticked me<br>off for not knowing about Adam Smith's<br>writing on jurisprudence I thought I was<br>really and not really later lawyer and<br>very good help to from two Australians<br>who came to surrounds funeral<br>Richard Cumpston and Richard Madden good<br>advice on actuarial and policy matters<br>and rehabilitation I just mentioned two<br>other facts which are comparative or two<br>other questions the first one is about<br>the proportion of GDP that the scheme<br>absorbs it's still under 2% a proportion<br>which over the years has been a good<br>deal less than the proportion of<br>Australia's GDP absorbed by workers<br>compensation and road traffic injuries<br>which of course have a much narrower<br>coverage<br>and and second how did the<br>administrative costs of operating the<br>scheme compared with those of other<br>schemes usually under 10% of the of the<br>premium and related income in any<br>particular year compared with 30% or so<br>and other systems a third matter<br>concerns the the need for bipartisan<br>support and for the fostering of that<br>support over the years there's been far<br>too much political bickering so far as I<br>can observe with insufficient attention<br>being given to the facts and to the<br>underlying policies and principles<br>I trust that I'm not being too<br>optimistic and drawing positive lessons<br>from the very brief life of the<br>privatization of injury insurance in the<br>early 1990s and the failure of the<br>incoming government and 2008 to give<br>effect to the policy it had announced<br>the previous year in opposition of<br>reestablishing a competitive market to<br>provide exigent insurance<br>PricewaterhouseCoopers had undertaken an<br>independent review in 2008 and it<br>concluded that the current highly<br>regarded ACCC scheme is consistent with<br>the woodhouse principles adds<br>considerable value to the New Zealand<br>Society and compares very well in<br>comparison to alternative schemes and<br>operation internationally so there you<br>have an independent report calling<br>attention to the facts and to the<br>principles and maybe that helped<br>introduce reason and an appreciation of<br>the facts for the incoming government<br>now I come finally to a conclusion of<br>some C and some sentences I trust and I<br>should try to get this right I trust<br>that I've given you a sense of the of<br>some of the lessons that<br>Suren and his person and his work has<br>taught to this country's great advantage<br>he drew on the wisdom of the ages he<br>drew on strong values on wide experience<br>on facts and was a great New Zealander I<br>end with not not with the quote from<br>Shakespeare that you have on your<br>invitation challenged me too much to try<br>to work out quite how I could use it but<br>you might go and look at it it's hot<br>spear the young Percy and Henry the<br>fourth part one trying to persuade a<br>reluctant Lord of the importance of<br>getting involved in the rebellion<br>against Richard the second which led to<br>his downfall and the installation of<br>Henry the fourth but I end with one<br>great friend of Owens one of his naval<br>colleagues left in and commander Dennis<br>Glover DSC and and their words that at<br>one point I tried but I didn't expect<br>any great success that they have<br>included in a judgment of the New<br>Zealand Court of Appeal this is what<br>Dennis clover said I do not dream of<br>Sussex Downs or quaint old england's<br>quaint old towns I think of what will<br>yet be seen in Johnsonville and<br>Geraldine thank you<br>you</p></main><footer
