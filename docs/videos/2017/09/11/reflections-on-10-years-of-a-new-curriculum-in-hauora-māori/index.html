my coffee or tea our call<br>kotaku catchy mom I'm a wife I look<br>really cool cutting maja keep her happy<br>but the typo 1002 I find more hi cojo<br>Dexter Tacoma I'll kill everyone and<br>thank you so much for coming along to<br>this medical forum and despite having<br>header how would a Maddie curriculum for<br>many years this is the first time we've<br>actually presented to the wider group as<br>to what our curriculum actually are so<br>although we've had an opportunity to<br>present to particular groups we've not<br>actually spoken at this forum so thank<br>you for coming a little bit about my<br>background and speaking to you today so<br>I am the associate dean Mardy for the<br>Dunedin School of Medicine and also the<br>associate professor for Maori health and<br>the associate dean Maori for the<br>division of health sciences and in those<br>various roles I've had the good fortune<br>and opportunity to work with a wonderful<br>group of people as we have grown and<br>developed the Maori House curriculum<br>within the Medical School and now more<br>broadly with them some of the other<br>parts of the division of Health Sciences<br>my professional background I was born<br>and bred in the South Island on the west<br>coast ambien and Marlborough and then I<br>went to medical school in Auckland and<br>we're on a bit of a journey and on that<br>journey it was really part of that<br>journey was about me exploring what it<br>meant to be a Maori doctor and how could<br>I make a difference for Maori health<br>trained in psychiatry for<br>number of years and thought that working<br>and mental health would be the place<br>that really supported me to make a<br>difference but I eventually headed<br>towards seeing if we could do more and<br>the prevention promotion making a<br>difference for population health and for<br>a whole after a long journey and that<br>pathway I ended up here at at the<br>University and in the medical school and<br>as I have had a a really great<br>opportunity to work across the school<br>and now the division to support the<br>wonderful teams of multi staff in people<br>who support and work with our Murray<br>staff who deliver what I think are some<br>really exciting innovative in<br>so I want to talk about where we've come<br>from where we are now in terms of our<br>curriculum what have been some of our<br>challenges and opportunities and then<br>for you Barry<br>what is the next ten years look like and<br>so and all the way through you'll see<br>that we have photographs and our<br>teaching we've really focused on trying<br>to make as experiential in his community<br>oriented and engaged with not just<br>within the university setting and<br>outside of that so I've tried to inject<br>some of the feel and the visual images<br>that surround some of the activity that<br>the students are doing so this as a<br>group of our fifth year students from a<br>number of years ago at the Marion Kelly<br>turn so prior to in a bit up until the<br>mid 2000s 2005 2006 Maori health set<br>within the medical curriculum it was a<br>topic there was a number of mixtures and<br>a workshop it was all undertaken on<br>campus and it focused on muddy models of<br>health and exploration of inequalities<br>with a little bit of teaching into some<br>attachments it was inconsistent between<br>the schools across the medical school<br>and it was very very positively<br>supported and was really this person<br>here who everyone will know John<br>Broughton and John really took the seed<br>of Maori health and grew it and<br>developed it and was recognized for his<br>contribution in the medical school in<br>2007 with an award at the very first<br>indigenous medical education conference<br>so I picked up from John and actually I<br>picked up from John at a really<br>important time and that was a time where<br>the whole medical school was going<br>through a big change and of course when<br>there's been changes that leads to real<br>opportunities and so we took that<br>opportunity and this is watch with<br>some of the context behind the changes<br>at that time the AMC accreditation had<br>very much increased its emphasis on the<br>need for all medical schools to have an<br>indigenous curriculum as I said the<br>Medical School was undergoing a time of<br>curriculum change restructuring and not<br>just restructuring and content at<br>restructured the whole process in anyone<br>who was around over that several year<br>time period we'll know the amount of<br>effort and work and also some of the<br>anxiety so we took an opportunity at<br>that point in time the division of<br>Health Sciences over the last decade has<br>really also been strengthening its<br>strategy and expectations for Maori<br>development and some of the developments<br>were paired have been really supported<br>by the vision that's held at a<br>divisional level alongside that of the<br>visions that we have at a school in<br>departmental level and 2006 the<br>university also launched a maori<br>strategic framework and that was the<br>first time that the university had<br>really collected up the number of areas<br>where it wanted to see real progress<br>made and in particular teaching and<br>curriculum so growing our curriculum was<br>also really aligned with the university<br>policy and then finally in the mid-2000s<br>the Medical Council put out a fairly<br>strong statement for an organization<br>that had not had a lot within its policy<br>framework that said that it expected<br>every medical practitioner to be able to<br>demonstrate cultural competency and in<br>particular had a full grounding of<br>understanding and being able to make a<br>difference for Maori health as part of<br>their cultural competencies so the decks<br>were aligned and I think just to come<br>back to that indigenous health framework<br>not only were we expected to have<br>indigenous curriculum but they were also<br>some guidelines provided and it led to<br>an expectation<br>offer quite a comprehensive curriculum<br>so that your is a focus that they<br>suggested we recover i'm spanned from<br>history and culture through to<br>understanding models of health clinical<br>presentations in working with<br>individuals so that span from the<br>population right through to working with<br>individuals and they also gave some<br>pointers and principles for how we<br>should be able to achieve that and very<br>much i think they did an extremely good<br>job of coming up with what has ended up<br>being a framework that has worked for us<br>which is to focus on experiential<br>learning to make indigenous health not a<br>topic that sits at the corner but<br>there's a core part of the curricula<br>that makes me focused on strengths based<br>approaches rather than deficit framing<br>and needs to be integrated both<br>vertically and horizontally quite<br>rightly it requires indigenous<br>leadership and the importance that<br>they've prioritized as in order to make<br>this effective and the attitudes of all<br>staff not just the people who teach<br>indigenous health but all staff we<br>surround the students and the program<br>need to be appropriate with regards to<br>indigenous health the importance of the<br>relationships was key and that it was<br>key to see indigenous health asserting<br>via and its own right and not as one of<br>many different cultures and maori as one<br>of those and so positioning at an<br>indigenous from an indigenous<br>perspective and also i suppose very much<br>from a Maori perspective that allows us<br>to also frame our teaching and learning<br>within a treaty framework also so the<br>division of Health Sciences strategy<br>formerly development which has been a<br>work in progress highlighted the why<br>this is really important and the aim to<br>aspire for alignment with Maori<br>aspirations for educational excellence<br>and of the elimination of health and<br>equity we have a whole number of<br>different<br>approaches that we can do this how can<br>we as a Medical School make a difference<br>for Maori health and alongside<br>curriculum we have our opportunity to<br>use our research we have an opportunity<br>to use our relationships and our<br>engagement with Maori communities to to<br>work with communities to reciprocate<br>over are the benefits of what we do as a<br>school we can support professional<br>development of everyone so everyone's<br>cultural competency is as built and we<br>can grow the Maori workforce both in<br>Health Professions but also in the<br>sciences and theory and finally amongst<br>those and this is one that's been<br>emphasized in the latest version of the<br>university's multi strategic framework<br>is that we desperately need to do<br>something to grow and develop Murray<br>staff less than 3% of the staff and the<br>university are moding we have growing<br>numbers of Maori students so and growing<br>expectations on things like the delivery<br>of money curricula are growing money<br>expertise to inform research so today's<br>talk is really about one of those prongs<br>and the whole way through our<br>development and the delivery of the<br>hidamari curriculum has been this goal<br>that the aim of the curriculum is to<br>lead to graduates who will be able to<br>come out and make a difference for Maori<br>health and so where do they make that<br>difference and how they make that<br>difference over the middle of the 2000s<br>we started meeting together as a<br>collective of Maori staff across the<br>medical school the different schools<br>Wellington Christchurch and Dunedin and<br>we put together what we thought would be<br>a curriculum that supported the kind of<br>graduate attributes that we were looking<br>for and we've talked about what are the<br>objectives the positions how and where<br>we would deliver it how we will decease<br>it an evaluator and who would be the<br>teachers in what we really focused on as<br>well was we're a small group let's learn<br>from each other we have Bridget Robson<br>and Wellington<br>who has got real expertise and<br>understanding and equalities and the<br>epidemiology behind health inequalities<br>but sees pitamah and Christchurch shows<br>worked on cardiovascular disease and<br>who's really informed on models within<br>curriculum delivery and we have a whole<br>range of different people and I've just<br>got a slide of some of the multi<br>research that's going on we were also<br>committed to evidence-based teaching and<br>learning and so what does our curriculum<br>look like now and this will reflect the<br>10-year journey if you're gonna think<br>that and 2006 we had I think there was<br>four lectures in a workshop and when in<br>the second year and another couple of<br>lectures and a workshop and third year<br>and an attachment based teaching so this<br>is our curriculum and I want to<br>acknowledge and the wonderful team that<br>supports supports this curriculum and<br>I'll talk a bit about the community as<br>we go so we have we've been on a bit of<br>a journey as we started out as a topic<br>we then became a thread and then<br>eventually we became a vertical module<br>so we now serve as a vertical module<br>within our curriculum and we sit there<br>alongside other vertical modules which<br>aim which don't have an attachment but<br>aim to be woven throughout and we've<br>kept our focus and that expectation at<br>Mardy health is important at all levels<br>as a public health physician I have a<br>particular focus and emphasis on how we<br>make a difference at a population health<br>level how we understand and equity and<br>inequalities the drivers of those and<br>one of the ways in which we can make a<br>difference we're working at the<br>community and organizational level<br>there's also really important roles that<br>can be had in terms of how does the<br>health sector engage with Mardy what<br>power money aspects of the health sector<br>growing and developing how do we work<br>with those areas and<br>the concept of cultural safety how does<br>an environment demonstrate its capacity<br>to be culturally safe so that modicum<br>can have great outcomes within their<br>environment and then coming down to<br>working with individuals and pharmo and<br>so this is about having in their tool<br>belt understanding of Maori beliefs<br>values experiences muddy worldviews<br>learning about consultation skills as<br>they relate to Marty how do you build a<br>relationship with moley patients and<br>family and then some core things today<br>are Maori competency so it does not okay<br>to come out as a to be a health<br>professional in this country and not be<br>able to pronounce the names of your<br>patients appropriately if people are<br>doing that then I think they need to<br>question if they haven't been on a<br>journey to build their competency in<br>that space then I suppose what we have<br>is we have really challenged our<br>students to expect a level of cultural<br>competency with some of these things<br>tikanga and values as well and so in<br>coming up with our curriculum which<br>takes those areas and adds objectives<br>and Lissa's a very catch down version of<br>what that looks like we've aimed to have<br>what is the end goal and such the whole<br>way through and then we can say well<br>what is it that we would expect a<br>graduate from here to look like what<br>knowledge do they need what skills do<br>they need what do they need to be able<br>to do and then when we assess people<br>what do we need to have been able to<br>observe that they can do so that we know<br>that they've reached those standards so<br>in early in the early years &amp; 2 &amp; 3<br>that's really where we've done our<br>foundations in terms of context<br>knowledge and skills and we cover the<br>historical and demographic contexts we<br>focus on the foundations for practice we<br>engage the students with the community<br>in the marae and we talk about Maori<br>models of health in fact to get them<br>working with those models and how they<br>might apply them and practice<br>we talk about key health issues<br>determinants solutions and understanding<br>and equity and we start to bring in an<br>understanding of the evidence the<br>research and the critical thinking that<br>goes behind what happens when you look<br>at evidence with regards to Maori health<br>so it looks a bit like this so we have<br>some prior lectures up until our second<br>year hold a Madi week and it's really<br>four days spread across four days a week<br>so the Prior lectures give us that<br>build-up why are we doing this health<br>status and equity and Modi models of<br>health now some of the challenge here is<br>that we have a class of 300 students so<br>obviously if we're going to achieve the<br>goals that we have we can't do that in a<br>lecture theatre you can't work with<br>people over the historical and political<br>contexts by using a mixture we can start<br>but we certainly won't get the kinds of<br>shifts and directions and engagement<br>that we want so over a number of years<br>we came up with what we think has now a<br>fairly robust though still with a few<br>tweaks week and we've just had this week<br>about three weeks ago and so it's really<br>fresh and many people's minds so on the<br>Monday we go to the museum and the<br>students do a range of preparatory and<br>introductory foundational workshops as<br>they build up to go into the Menai they<br>get to know a bit more about the local<br>community explore Takano explore an<br>introduction to treaty and they start to<br>learn concepts about Mahima here and<br>engaging with each other engaging with<br>Mardy and understanding those concepts<br>and we're really thankful to the museum<br>who open their doors to us and we use<br>all sorts of spaces so if you happen to<br>go to visit the Maori part of the museum<br>when we have our day you'll be tripping<br>over little panels and groups of medical<br>students with our staff as choy shows<br>and the staff of the museum also to<br>share with us on Tuesday and Wednesday<br>we have to split the class and so we<br>have half of the class go out to<br>attitude in Menai and do a range of<br>things which I'll talk through and then<br>on the other half stay here we take over<br>the entire Hunter Center and they do a<br>really interactive treaty-based today<br>and set of workshops in on the Thursday<br>the two groups one comes to the calhoun<br>one comes to here and they present back<br>from what they have done as part of a<br>and exercise from from the hunter scene<br>today so i just want to give you a bit<br>of some of the imagery so this is what's<br>going on at the Museum and the gentleman<br>Nia is Hatter Tim Moore who is our Kumar<br>Toa<br>he used to work in the hospital and was<br>very much valued and respected there and<br>he's since moved to the University and<br>we are hugely privileged to have him he<br>supports us over taking the guidance and<br>wide or guidance but he also is part of<br>our teaching team and so alongside the<br>other students and this is Cal he said<br>oh yeah and again the workshops that the<br>students are doing via aim to the<br>support understanding of poverty process<br>what they're going through and provides<br>small group interactive learning<br>opportunities in the next day they go to<br>this Medaille a tie to do funny at itu-t<br>attitude M&amp;I and it's on Shetland street<br>so this is our urban that I hear the<br>students participate in the porphyry and<br>we have this as fire windy who's one of<br>our community people who every year<br>comes and supports us and what we do<br>choral supports us from the poverty and<br>in the students also participate and<br>engage as part of that so Lunan water<br>and being fully engaged in the poverty<br>as part of the teaching and learning so<br>over the course of the day we have to<br>Del Mar D and want to acknowledge our D<br>and J Hana this year who really stepped<br>up and supported our to do and again the<br>students are starting on a journey which<br>hopefully will mean that my time they<br>come out at the other end they feeling<br>confident to be able to use T real Maori<br>in a way which if it's not perfect they<br>will have an opportunity and feel<br>confident to be able to ask how how do I<br>do this what what approach do I take and<br>so we really it's a bit of a work in<br>progress for us in terms of what's the<br>best way of supporting the students<br>today all needs and we the Reavers are<br>that over time so Mahima he and<br>introduction who am i what am i about<br>and the students all learn they write<br>and they learn they're Mahima heat and<br>they stand up and they Mohito each other<br>so this is who am i where am i from and<br>what was my role and a little bit about<br>themselves by time the students get to<br>the end of their the imedicalschool we<br>expect that they will be able to stand<br>up and very confidently and confidently<br>be able to say in the heat then<br>obviously the food in the hospitality in<br>the marketing of the community is part<br>of all of our teaching and learning and<br>so in terms of the roles of our staff<br>sorry Fred<br>Tony gave me the photos got this this<br>photo here because what I really really<br>value about the team that we have is<br>that not only are they going through all<br>of the roles that they have to teach him<br>deliver but there's a sense of constant<br>reflecting and thinking about how can we<br>do this better<br>what do we need to learn from this<br>oh we've just had an idea where perhaps<br>could do this in this way and it's a<br>really engaged learning process and and<br>just as we really value the<br>strengths-based approach that we hope<br>that people will take when we work in<br>Marty education we have Co pepper of<br>philosophy that we see each and every<br>student that we work with as being<br>someone who brings strength and who<br>brings real attributes into that<br>learning space and so we are learning as<br>much from the students how do we respond<br>to them how do we do what we need to do<br>better<br>there's something too complicated do we<br>need to explain that a little bit more<br>or all we've lost them they seem to be<br>asleep perhaps we need to really ramp<br>this up and do this in a slightly<br>different way and so that the energy and<br>the commitment that goes into making<br>this a very focused and high-quality<br>teaching and learning and engaged<br>experience it's hard to explain but I do<br>feel very privileged with that<br>commitment to teaching that there is on<br>the treaty day and a lot o who is off<br>with her beautiful little baby<br>at the moment has worked very hard<br>alongside other members of the team to<br>come up with a way of teaching the<br>treaty that gives the students space in<br>time to explore issues associated with<br>the treaty in a guided way but not on a<br>restricted way and they cover a lot of<br>material each of the rooms and mahanta<br>set has set up for their small group<br>looming and it's got a range of<br>exercises that they work through over<br>the course of the day with tutors<br>popping in and out but leaving them with<br>their guided exercises to joy so this is<br>where the evidence comes in lots of<br>thinking about what is the evidence how<br>do we work with the evidence what we do<br>how do we make sense of this as well as<br>some very specific exercises and a lot<br>of it's very official students are<br>interacting with official material<br>although all the way through the day in<br>the final day the students come back and<br>they<br>do a presentation and in those<br>presentations they present their in<br>aspect of what they have done and the<br>treaty workshop as part of their small<br>groups people do my attire they make<br>posters they do videos we had slam<br>poetry and it's a really amazing day I<br>muster that I've got seen all of the<br>videos of it and I was really blown away<br>by both the energy and the thought and<br>the amazing creativity that the students<br>have individually in a collective of tea<br>and I suppose we in teaching the treaty<br>we know that this is not easy material<br>to engage some people worth but what<br>we've found over the years and I think<br>it's a mixture of changing the way that<br>it gets taught but also this commitment<br>from the students to really fully engage<br>in with us is that we don't have too<br>many concerns about the individual<br>students the odd student we have has<br>some challenges but again they really<br>come to the party and they engage with<br>the treaty and some of the solutions so<br>it's very solution focused some of that<br>and the ideas they come up with about<br>how we could do things better how they<br>could make a difference for Maori health<br>is actually really inspiring and we're<br>very proud of I think but in leaves a<br>second-year student so this is starting<br>on their journey and so yeah we we get a<br>little bit emotional I think sometimes<br>about where the students have come from<br>and we they are so in third year it's a<br>bit more standard teaching and learning<br>from a university perspective they have<br>four different lecture slots three to<br>our ones and one one our one and they<br>have a key topics and key areas we were<br>able to explore the evidence and<br>approaches to how we make a difference<br>but if enjoying session has been led by<br>friend and and hutter together and<br>that's a really a wonderful opportunity<br>for the students to see the value of a<br>Kamata and what they bring into our<br>understanding and knowledge so four five<br>six the theme there is Hold'em early in<br>action and again feedback from students<br>as<br>it's all well to learn how it emollient<br>and theory but what happens if we<br>actually try and put it under practice<br>so we're possible all of the four five<br>and six teaching that we do is about<br>engaging the students and actual doing<br>stuff and so they learn about<br>applications of various engagement<br>models models of health news until they<br>get to interact and engage with<br>community health providers with a whole<br>range of different groups and so in our<br>attachment based teaching we have two<br>sessions women psychological medicine<br>one on public health and then we teach<br>we have a couple of sessions and<br>pediatrics and have recently joined with<br>general practice to do some teaching and<br>Etim so the two models of engagement<br>that we work with women's the holy<br>process and that is really supporting<br>the students to form relationships with<br>Maori patients and Maddie community and<br>famou before launching into what are we<br>going to do about this so we use the<br>terms that they've learnt as part of<br>going on to them arrive and Mahima he<br>like a familiar tango which as making a<br>connection cope up but what is it about<br>and then the fear well how do we finish<br>this off and that's a model that across<br>all of the schools we teach across all<br>the years and just want to acknowledge<br>those paidamma<br>hos PhD and her life's work I think to<br>date has been to work with these models<br>and help support and we might implement<br>these to lead to cultural competency in<br>that consultation space the second one<br>is the maihama model which is really and<br>taking not only waters we're about the<br>person that you're seeing in front of<br>you that model of health that has<br>physical mental spiritual health and the<br>interest integrates it with what's our<br>understanding about the factors that are<br>impacting on that person and now it'll<br>Moana is the currents of the Seas and<br>these are things like far no name<br>so the environment and then other<br>factors which impact on people and this<br>is where some of the more hard to teach<br>stuff comes in the impacts of<br>colonization and pecked of racism<br>marginalization so we now teach racism<br>we teach students about the impact of<br>racism we teach students about ways of<br>working so that they don't so that they<br>can understand that and self reflection<br>on things like implicit bias and so<br>these are whether this is one of the the<br>things that we teach we teach this<br>within our public health module so a<br>first year no human eye is probably our<br>most intensive and and focused thing<br>because the students stay with us so we<br>take our entire 50 class to attack home<br>on I for three days and two nights and<br>at that monoi it's like they've entered<br>another world and and it's a pressure<br>cooked environment they are up at seven<br>o'clock in the morning and we finished<br>the teaching and learning side of things<br>at suppertime at about half past nine<br>and within that we have a mixture of<br>you're here you're part of the fun oh<br>you're part of the community you get<br>involved in working with the meals and<br>doing cleaning and all of those things<br>and then some very very specific<br>objectives that we're hoping that we can<br>meet and those objectives sit across<br>understanding the community and its<br>context so they learn about that<br>community its history and its<br>environment friend does a wonderful play<br>which engages the students and will bury<br>a ninja which you might be able to talk<br>about a bit later if we've got time and<br>it takes the students and to another way<br>of thinking and understanding pharmo<br>experiences of health and the health<br>sector they do a new workshop this year<br>that's about partnerships how do you<br>build partnerships with Maori far know<br>communities but in particular this is<br>working with people<br>have Marty expertise particularly in the<br>traditional healing rounds and that was<br>a really wonderful workshop that took<br>students under understanding some of the<br>more in-depth areas which impact on<br>mental health and particular they they<br>revisit Terrell whiter wider and and<br>things like weaving and that engages<br>them again with a whole lot of thinking<br>and talking about core concepts module<br>that in a lot to developed we're one of<br>their biggest challenges in terms of<br>cultural competency is it there's always<br>that statement that says an order to be<br>culturally competent you have to be able<br>to reflect on your own who are you and<br>understand yourself and then therefore<br>how does that mean you might relate to<br>others so Emma did her master's in<br>public health on cultural competency and<br>out of there emerged a workshop and that<br>workshop is we call the pop-up<br>opposition and in small of the students<br>create a book about themselves that<br>talks about a whole range of things but<br>in particular who is their family what<br>is their culture what are their values<br>some important things to them and they<br>get created in a visual way so they get<br>they get pens and paper and some of them<br>just do the most incredible jobs of<br>doing it so they do this on them a tie<br>and then we go into small groups and<br>they present first and as probably of<br>all of the things we teach it is the one<br>where we get real our moments that come<br>out of this particular workshop their<br>students the penny drops why are we<br>focusing on connection why are we<br>valuing who people are where they come<br>from<br>why just people stories matter and why<br>does my understanding of my own story<br>measure as well it's very profound and<br>and awesome<br>that is the part of their normal I be<br>the most tissues get us this year we've<br>also been really ramping up our the the<br>other feedback we had from students was<br>we'd love to hear from doctors too<br>their challengers what are the things<br>that they're doing so this year we<br>brought in the doctors and it was great<br>we bring a mixture of really experienced<br>doctors but we also bring in graduates<br>so our own graduates who have graduated<br>in the last two or three years and that<br>has been great they come back and they<br>tell the students what it's like and how<br>they're looking to make a difference in<br>re health and then we have a simulated<br>clinic which we bring together our staff<br>our Ferno<br>we have the odd sort of actor that is<br>coming out of an acting process but the<br>rest are actors that are our community<br>members and so the students rotate<br>through this I just give you a bit of a<br>feel and so the first few photos are<br>from our early days when we were going<br>to them and I at at cutter Tony and this<br>is a beautiful man I out there and one<br>of the great things about this is it<br>gets us to take the students to some of<br>the most beautiful places we have around<br>here and many of them have never been to<br>some of the beautiful areas we have<br>around the Tucker<br>this was our teaching time lots of lots<br>of good humor I think amongst our team<br>at times and again this is the students<br>coming together getting to know each<br>other sharing about themselves and very<br>much that small group big group<br>interactive workshops Sharon KY and<br>being part of the delivering of Chi<br>everyone is in a group that is a host<br>and this is the paka paka session we<br>have now have smaller groups but in the<br>first one you can see those things the<br>first one we had slightly bigger groups<br>we decided smaller was more intimate so<br>this was one of our students back a few<br>years ago Joel people may remember and<br>he really engaged and got involved in<br>everything that we did and then of<br>course is the serving of others as part<br>of this and a final thing that we do is<br>that the groups who were on serving also<br>have to provide entertainment and that<br>has been also really great part of us so<br>want to acknowledge we<br>again who comes from the community and<br>she uses Anika Catholics as part of her<br>healing when she works with women who<br>have health issues and so this is a kind<br>of an opportunity for the students to<br>meet with people like Wendy and other<br>healers and people who weak in the<br>health sector to get a feel for why and<br>how people do things with them that Moni<br>health space differently and so this is<br>more recently the last couple of years<br>and this is from this year's Mohammed<br>eye last couple of years we've been<br>going to a taco with our fifth year<br>group and this is fran performing her<br>play and one day i hope that all of you<br>will get a chance to see things pray<br>it's just amazing and again takes the<br>student somewhere where they might not<br>have been expecting to go and that's<br>that's part of the journey that we have<br>is that the students don't always when<br>they reflect back they often will<br>reflect back but I thought something<br>very different than what I was expecting<br>from that and and I think that's partly<br>because we use really different and<br>diverse teaching methods which come at<br>people from different angles and they<br>don't quite know what to expect but I<br>think in the end it makes a real<br>difference and so this is our simulated<br>clinic without the people in it and we<br>have seven stations and they rotate<br>through and really small groups we don't<br>have the staff and the ER with them we<br>leave it to them and with this is<br>getting them practicing their<br>consultation and engagement cells<br>knowing that they may or may not have a<br>whole demoted station in the Oski which<br>is also important and these are rare<br>actors from this year talking and they<br>at the end they come together and they<br>provide feedback what worked really well<br>what made me feel like I really wanted<br>to talk to people this is what was at<br>mom and and the little girl Thea is we<br>not only have our staffers actors but we<br>also have our children and so that's<br>George alato alias the girl with the<br>ESMA and then we have Mason whose<br>friends and he has supported us many<br>years now coming in and being a patient<br>for us and we really value those those<br>people<br>and these are our doctors and you will<br>recognize Lauren Barnett who graduated<br>last year and sad news there also be<br>brought back and then of course Joel who<br>we've been getting back he's working up<br>on fuckathon here and he comes back and<br>he talks about what he does on a<br>practical day-to-day basis to make a<br>difference for money health and the guy<br>on the right there as Demeter fatty who<br>is a long-standing GP of the auto health<br>clinic he's also might expect mate and<br>he is an incredibly experienced and<br>grounded GP and has a wealth of<br>experience and then of course right in<br>the middle here because she's always<br>taking the photo so she hasn't popped up<br>in any of our photos with Joey and so<br>Joey and how would a Maddie<br>administrator show but I think that<br>administrator is probably not quite the<br>right word for Tori she is our lunch<br>lunch / Noel the glue that holds our<br>hold Ahmadi and time together and so<br>again a part of our Chi Papa is to thank<br>and acknowledge all of the people so<br>this was part of our thank you to those<br>people for coming and joining us and as<br>their parting words they also provide I<br>think some inspiration for our students<br>so how do we assess our holder Modi we<br>have in second year we expect assess we<br>expect attendance to be compulsory it's<br>a terms requirement they do their group<br>presentation and we observe that and<br>it's really expected that they do that<br>and there's often formative question and<br>the short answer questions and third<br>year we may or may not have a question<br>and the short answer questions and<br>fourth year we don't have a specific<br>assessment but we don't expect people to<br>attend and we will try and cover over<br>the core material if they haven't<br>attended and probably first year as we<br>we've got our most assessments they do a<br>reflective essay after the norm would I<br>they have multi choice questions and the<br>common exam and for the last we were we<br>have had the<br>Trinity to have hold Ahmadi than the<br>ASCII I'm not allowed to say that we<br>actually do what don't have holder Modi<br>and this is ASCII but we have their<br>opportunity for Evan holder Maddie and<br>the Oscar and that has been a really<br>huge step and meeting that goal of can<br>we see whether students can demonstrate<br>that they have picked up and can do the<br>competencies that we've asked of them we<br>do a whole range of evaluations we do<br>some of the standard HED see wells but<br>we also do something called exit tickets<br>where we ask students to talk about what<br>they lied what they didn't like what we<br>change and we also use a Hello Kitty R<br>model we are game they write things<br>we're really responsive and over the<br>course of time people will look through<br>the evaluations and say gosh we need to<br>do something about this the timings<br>wrong with whatever so really used a lot<br>and very responsive Lee so our<br>challengers have been around we have a<br>large number of students and they're<br>really diverse and help science first<br>year there is one lecture on things<br>Marty and because people are really<br>diverse we can't guarantee that anyone<br>knows anything else so we have to start<br>from a very foundational place we've had<br>a growing number of Maori staff but<br>within the core how would I marry time<br>you can see from all of the people<br>involved that you can't run an emotion<br>like this without bringing on and we<br>call on community far no friends<br>children cleaners everyone gets involved<br>in making this work for our medical<br>school and I just really want you know I<br>suppose people to know that the<br>community comes and behind this and very<br>much supports it the logistics and again<br>I want to acknowledge Tori and all the<br>other people that help make this work<br>and probably one of the challenges and<br>chains of the material is hearts and<br>minds how do we get people you can learn<br>content but if you've grown up in a<br>household where you've not heard<br>anything positive about things Marty and<br>you bring that into Medical School with<br>you what are the ways<br>which we can use medical education to<br>change people so you're not going to get<br>it changed through there it's got to be<br>through the air and so again I think<br>we've had some very important moments<br>with students where they have tackled<br>what are some quite unground beliefs and<br>thinking about things nerdy and so I<br>think that take learn different<br>difficult material and then the balance<br>between content and process<br>I just wanted to divert a little bit and<br>chose something that I've been seeing a<br>lot more in some of the education<br>conferences and things that I've been<br>going to which is the concept of<br>threshold concepts and it's a bit like<br>learning to ride a bike once you've<br>learned to ride a bike you can you can<br>do it and you can unlearn it and you<br>have no idea how you couldn't know how<br>to do this threshold concepts really I<br>think it resonates with me because we<br>have people who are at a point where<br>they kind of know there's something they<br>need to get that they don't quite get it<br>and they work with it and then when they<br>write reflective essays yes that's a I<br>got it absolutely got it and and that's<br>when we know that they they will start<br>to really explore who they are how do we<br>do this meter and so that's a bit of a<br>lengthy quote as from a reflective essay<br>and just to summarize it though I shall<br>let you ever read it's a fairly typical<br>right home yeah so that that and you can<br>see that I got hurt moment and there and<br>we get we have that happening over time<br>so the concept of our call from a Marty<br>perspective I think has also K to this<br>and the teachers and learners and<br>partnership with each other and that<br>constants making sense of the<br>interactions making sense of the<br>connections and again the students in<br>their experience with the teachers are<br>also engaging with their and<br>understanding what that means and then<br>connell Hato who I really do want to<br>acknowledge has become I think a crucial<br>and key part to our learning as people<br>get that experience of learning from<br>people who aren't the lecturers this is<br>someone who's a lunar distance Amer<br>community who brings a great wealth of<br>experience and has allowed us to explore<br>some dimensions that we perhaps haven't<br>been able to before<br>so the kind of the commitment from the<br>community is a critical success factor<br>and we have huge community by and<br>support for our programs and also from<br>our farm mode and again I really really<br>want to acknowledge all of those people<br>and groups who support us so the ten<br>year journey my reflections really and I<br>just really want to line up with<br>okie from writer who which is more taro<br>are more corrodium moody aki-nee for us<br>and their children after us and our<br>vision I think it's motive staffers that<br>our children and our far know and<br>communities will know that when they go<br>into the health sector they will find<br>and have health professionals who will<br>get them and who will make a real<br>difference and so we we feel very<br>privileged to have the roles that we<br>have to achieve them so the next 10<br>years I've got some specific things but<br>I also I think have some bigger picture<br>things so we're renovating our third<br>year we would love to do our third year<br>in a more experienced all way we think<br>that lectures don't really really get us<br>there so we'd like to think about how we<br>could do something more<br>rector than that space we are vying to<br>get some time at the very beginning of<br>40th the feedback that we have as it<br>would be great to do the foot for<br>knowing of hunger aspects of this right<br>up front and fourth years are we working<br>on there would like to do a bit more<br>attachment based teaching more clinical<br>application and fifth year and then<br>entire year and move towards a lot more<br>community engagement if we possibly<br>could we have to Kiker the clinic and<br>South Dunedin coming up and would love<br>to do some opportunities for placements<br>and hold Ahmadi professional development<br>for non Mardi staff has come up<br>frequently and that's on our agenda and<br>I'd also love to be able to take and<br>engage more in areas outside so this is<br>my Mariah and south iceland and it would<br>be fantastic to take students more far<br>afield into some places that we also<br>call home the under professional space<br>is an interesting one for Marty because<br>we're already a really really<br>interprofessional group and the medical<br>school here in Dunedin I am the only<br>doctor and our holida motor team<br>everywhere else is very diverse and our<br>concept of interprofessional is not<br>people who have necessarily have health<br>professional qualifications that's part<br>of it but it's our community and the<br>other people who bring those skills and<br>expertise so finally a huge<br>acknowledgement to all of the people who<br>might help make this work and I've got<br>to be picture of LEM bein in the medical<br>school cuz learn also has been our<br>working alongside Joey has been a<br>wonderful support for us as we've<br>journeyed through this so I'm going to<br>finish the year once come close to time<br>tada<br>my waters marketing my kitty I'm sorry<br>I've cut it close to tie but it does<br>anyone have any questions so we had that<br>woven all the way through and I think<br>and so I've talked about coral Hatter<br>who who deals who right at the start of<br>second year the students goes to a cycle<br>where tia is and so that's about keeping<br>yourself safe from a spiritual<br>perspective and as part of that they<br>learn about the there's a way in which<br>we use cutter care to keep people safe<br>and the people who have expertise and<br>that wide or space and then the working<br>with health providers working with other<br>people then they get to meet people who<br>are practitioners in terms of MIDI MIDI<br>and we talk about how people use for<br>more practitioners depending on who's<br>available will depend on what experience<br>the students get so we also have had<br>fire Lavinia come down<br>from adult anyway and she is a little<br>more practitioner so it's kind of woven<br>through rather than sitting out there is<br>a as a topic and what we would hope is<br>that by time the students finished that<br>they had the capacity to work alongside<br>and with traditional healers and Laura</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
