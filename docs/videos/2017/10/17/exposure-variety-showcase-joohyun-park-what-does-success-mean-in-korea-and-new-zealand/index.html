Does “Success” Mean in Korea and New Zealand?'</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi my name is Jim Park I'm a doctoral<br>student in the Faculty of Education and<br>so to work today I'd like to talk about<br>my exploratory qualitative study which<br>is the first part of my doctoral<br>research the main purpose of this study<br>was to explore and compare the cultural<br>conceptions of success in Korea and New<br>Zealand in this study semi structured<br>individuals interviews were conducted<br>with a total of 20 Korean and European<br>usual and university students in Korea<br>and New Zealand I am so delighted that I<br>can participate variety showcased and<br>exposure because I found that and<br>believed that this category would be the<br>most suitable for me to maximize the<br>quality of my research data because what<br>I wanted to do was not only just suggest<br>themes coals and quotations that I found<br>from the diss study but also suggest the<br>contents tones facial expressions and<br>even feelings that I observed from the<br>interviews so I will present the<br>findings of their study by using the<br>format of a drama I will perform as a<br>Korean New Zealander<br>and this is a part of this drama part<br>part of script of this drama bleep pot<br>is written by myself well part is<br>written by mixing twenty participants<br>interviewed transcriptions so please<br>remind that a majority section of this<br>drama is representing participants<br>viewpoints except for the wrap-up and<br>take-home message section of this drama<br>now this is it please enjoy this drama<br>when I was a high school student in<br>Korea entering a priest the university<br>was our dream<br>it was our standard of success in order<br>to achieve that goal I need to study at<br>cram schools until midnight the amount<br>of studying was endless and there was<br>there were never-ending tests sometimes<br>after nervous what if my grades go down<br>how can I see my parents base anyway I<br>need to endure this time because I<br>believe that I can live a successful<br>happy and is life once I can enter a<br>good university luckily I could enter a<br>so-called good university then I<br>experienced of filling up loss and<br>depression because I realized that my<br>life is neither successful nor happy as<br>I expected as I and as is dreamed yeah<br>but I need to enjoy that time but yeah<br>and then I realized that there is a<br>success myth somebody told me that if<br>you study hard and if you can work if<br>you can enter a good university your<br>life is successful but that was not true<br>in my case anyway I realized that my<br>successful was automatically changed to<br>work in a famous and a good company or<br>find a find respectable job like a judge<br>or like a doctor so what I had to do was<br>I need to do my best effort in order to<br>win at a high competition of job<br>employment so I had to I had to get and<br>maintain high level academic majors<br>secondly and all<br>I need to have several qualifications<br>that I update approve my abilities also<br>I need to have internship experience etc<br>had to achieve something more than a<br>list anyway I did because I want to get<br>social reputation and social position I<br>think in Korea so sorry Korean people<br>are more concerned about social<br>reputation and social judgement so<br>sometimes including me when you wanted<br>we tend to show off our material wealth<br>in order to get positive impression from<br>others and I think the most powerful and<br>most common success image in Korea<br>society is money I think there is a<br>common conception that if you have money<br>you can do anything if you don't have<br>money in a sense can be guilty and I<br>think Korean society fosters the ideas<br>that more money brings happiness in life<br>but is that true I don't think so<br>my brother works in a very famous<br>company and many people admirers admire<br>his job because he earns a lot of money<br>but he says he doesn't look happy at all<br>he has to overwork almost every day and<br>he needs to go back his office early in<br>the morning I think he sacrificed his<br>present life for his future happiness<br>like him many Koreans think and dream<br>like this someday in the future<br>and here is another story<br>as I travel to New Zealand and began<br>studying here I realized that you the<br>images of success in usually is quite<br>different compared to Korea Cubans do<br>not want to sacrifice their present life<br>Kiwis I found that Kiwis do want to have<br>current happiness instead of delaying it<br>for the future happiness and what I<br>observe is another thing that I observed<br>is that Kiwi value New Zealanders value<br>work-life balance so they want to spend<br>enough time with their family and<br>friends instead of working late and also<br>they want to add a value of holidays and<br>Trevor rather than going to the office<br>or summer so I think it is sore about<br>balance and there's another point that I<br>want to talk about that is family I<br>think there is a stereotype that Koreans<br>for a high value on family tie and<br>relationship yes widow family is<br>important for Koreans<br>however our society is so competitive<br>and our life is so busy so it is not<br>easy for us to have enough time with<br>family on the other hand for Kiwis it<br>seems that family is their priority so<br>having enough time with family members<br>and having a close relationship with<br>them our kind of cultural success image<br>in New Zealand society of course I'm not<br>saying that money and social reputation<br>are not important in New Zealand so<br>sorry my my friend told me that<br>especially nowadays New Zealand is<br>getting more heading toward more<br>business-minded country that interest<br>before yeah certainly I think so money<br>and home ownership<br>are important cultural ideas of success<br>in New Zealand society and another point<br>I want to talk about social reputation<br>as you know you Julian is quite sporting<br>nation so sports success is highly<br>respected so if one of you are<br>professional rugby team player or if you<br>are professional with any sports team I<br>think many people will respect you<br>before I came to New Zealand Korean<br>culture persuade me to seek educational<br>success material success and social<br>success so there was comparatively less<br>place that I insist that I want to be<br>happy now because of competition also<br>frankly speaking I don't want to be<br>loser in the society so I had to say but<br>what I found what I experienced in New<br>Zealand is that money social reputation<br>are of course important however family<br>and self-satisfaction are also important<br>success criteria in New Zealand so sorry<br>although I think I'm well settled into<br>noodle society and culture from time to<br>time I feel fresher like study more over<br>the weekends or even on holidays and<br>sometimes I found that I'm more<br>concerned about others views and<br>judgments instead of my own decision<br>because I have experienced by both<br>Korean and New Zealand culture can you<br>imagine that how Koreans can be<br>frustrated when they first came to New<br>John and experience different culture<br>maybe it will take time for them to<br>experience encounter and understand<br>different culture in usual so sorry<br>because they were expected a little bit<br>different things when they were in Korea<br>this is the end of this drama before<br>finishing I would like to introduce<br>a beautiful Korean folk song titled<br>hollow Arirang the theme of this song is<br>the hope for unification between North<br>and South Korea but this song is also<br>used for praying peace in the world I<br>will sing a part of this song in Korean<br>language in the hope for peace and<br>harmony in our terror anew joint where<br>many ethnic groups live together and<br>damn young shield or a boom swooned up<br>Kolkata hum gay couple town<br>I hope that you can get a glimpse of<br>understanding about Korean Korean<br>culture and their life priorities thank<br>you so much for your listening do you<br>have any questions about my study okay<br>I'm not sure if the microphone works but<br>I'll go first so just to pick up on the<br>theme of unification I was actually<br>interested more in the kind of I guess<br>the tensions and particularly with some<br>of the participants in your study if<br>there's any tensions between<br>first-generation immigrants from Korea<br>to New Zealand and maybe their children<br>who grew up in New Zealand and some of<br>the I guess the different aims and<br>objectives that they have for their<br>lives if there's kind of any kind of you<br>know tensions between parents and<br>children and how that comes through in<br>your study yeah<br>in fact I'll when I talk when I talk<br>about participants I didn't clearly tell<br>you that I recruited two groups of<br>Koreans in New Zealand one group is I<br>called them Korean Kili they born in<br>Korea and educated educated from until<br>high school in Korea and then came to<br>New Zealand for their high higher<br>education and another group is Kiwi<br>Korean they were born in New Zealand and<br>educated only in New Zealand setting<br>because I want to see whether because in<br>this study I asked to not only ask about<br>cultural ideas of success but also asked<br>about personal ideas of success and I<br>hypothesized that Korean Kiwi koreans<br>ideas of success are more close to Kiwis<br>ideas of success because they were<br>educated here a coach incarcerated here<br>but why one interesting point is that<br>Korean chemist's ideas of success are<br>more close to Kiwis<br>years of success this is partly because<br>is that key with a Korean kV who came to<br>recently made a decision to come to New<br>Zealand by themselves they they wanted<br>to come here by their will but in case<br>of Kiwi Korean participants they came<br>here by their parents Ville so they and<br>they were I think they were influenced<br>by their parents so their ideas of<br>success are more close to Koreans in<br>Korea so even though they occurred they<br>were incarcerated in New Zealand society<br>for a long time if their parents have<br>Korean style ideas of success I think<br>their yeah their perceptions of success<br>are more inclined to Korean so I think<br>there is a penchant between Korean<br>culture and usually culture from Kiwi<br>Korean girls yeah so you um talked a lot<br>about Koreans being influenced by a Kiwi<br>culture yeah so I was wondering if you<br>had any thoughts of the reverse of Kiwis<br>themselves being influenced by Korean<br>culture because New Zealand has a very<br>multicultural yeah yeah it's possible<br>because I found them some Kiwi people<br>giving like kpop new kpop and kdrama so<br>they are may be influenced by that<br>culture but I'm not quite sure because<br>Korean society is kind of high minority<br>in New Jersey so sorry<br>so some of you some on p.m. Kiwi for<br>really interested in about Korean<br>culture may have similar ideas of<br>success with Koreans in Korea but I'm<br>not quite sure because in my study it<br>I just want how longs it take until<br>other that's a generation or as a<br>migrant coming from Korea to New Zealand<br>do you start to lose some of those<br>ideals and sort of traditional values<br>and start going towards the new zealand<br>type of ideals for success yeah I'm so<br>sorry but can you please fme well sure<br>it's it's for at what point do you start<br>losing some of the ideals that you had<br>in Korea and start taking on more New<br>Zealand type ideals for success since a<br>generation to generations or do you just<br>transition from home countries do you<br>mean I want to ask my idea or my opinion<br>yeah I think so let me talk about my<br>thought that my lifestyle is more<br>suitable with Kiwis out in this culture<br>so I think I'm pickly adapt to new<br>zealand culture because this was based<br>on my decision but if someone percent me<br>you need to go to New Zealand and you<br>need to study here but in that case I<br>think there is a possibility that I<br>can't reject this culture so I think it<br>depends on personal personal decision<br>but of course the the length of<br>residence in usual would be possible<br>option a possible factor because if I<br>live here for a long time that means I<br>will have more chance to communicate<br>with kids communicate with local people<br>and also I have to use English so<br>English is and Korean is so different so<br>on the way using of English I think the<br>ideas of or the lifestyle can be also<br>influenced by using of language so I<br>think personal decision as well as the<br>lengths of residency in<br>also can be of possible factors that<br>change individuals ideas of success yes<br>how different do you think the<br>perceptions of Kiwi Koreans and Korean<br>Kiwis would be to Koreans still and<br>Korea how do you are you asking how two<br>Korean groups are different compared to<br>Korean group when I asked about personal<br>ideas of success although I didn't show<br>you in this performance it was found<br>that they more they are more they tend<br>they told me that they're more value<br>family relationship and their personal<br>selections or self personal satisfaction<br>compared to Koreans in Korea because<br>nobody mentioned about family<br>relationship and their personal<br>happiness Inc when I asked about what is<br>your personal ideas of success to<br>Koreans in Korea so there was the<br>biggest difference that I observed
