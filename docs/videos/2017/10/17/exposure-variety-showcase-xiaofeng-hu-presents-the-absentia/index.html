0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hey everyone planning Sofia a master<br>student from our survey today I'm here<br>to talk about my research<br>the absent a prolific exploration of<br>absence the present and I have two<br>musicians and seven dancers for this<br>case and I've listed DNA and it's going<br>but unfortunately I only got three<br>dances today before getting into my<br>research question I want to talk about<br>the background of the research I am<br>conducting this research under the<br>master of done studies the University of<br>Auckland for examination purpose in this<br>research will outcome in folk active<br>writings and choreographer performance<br>the EPS of my research are to find out<br>meanings absence has to presence and to<br>develop a crow buffet of absence my<br>research also aim to found out a<br>relationship absence and presence may<br>have so that I may build new<br>conversations between the teeth for<br>achieving my research aims I thought to<br>use the theories of qualitative<br>practices late and post the positivism<br>as the master logical paradise the<br>reason for male teachers cognitive is<br>because a values the ways of knowing by<br>using a qualitative paradigm I can have<br>chance to explore understandings and<br>knowledge of human hand and what<br>importantly by using a qualitative<br>paradigm I can promote like more<br>possibilities variations and new<br>thoughts for my research and a post the<br>positivism paradigm emphasized on making<br>meanings so the way of researching it<br>can be linked<br>to practice late research as they both<br>look for making mayonnaise along the<br>process of the research and a practice<br>late research can be understood as<br>subjective emergent and<br>interdisciplinary it emphasized in<br>indicates on knowing from the process of<br>doing or making as a dancer in the crow<br>prefer it seems natural or logical form<br>a to make a den space as the way to<br>explore my research query the muscles<br>are used for this research is studio<br>practice to which I will take my dancers<br>with me to dance did it and I also give<br>them some clerical tasks beside Pinay<br>and the corporate task is basically like<br>something related to my research<br>questions and I asked my dancers and<br>instead of answering that they will<br>answer in a densely way for example if<br>you ask me like what's your name I will<br>not say oh my name is 700s I like so the<br>movement and to draw it with my body and<br>that's the workerle perfect process so<br>it has AIDS I observed my dancers doing<br>a way of research and I will also<br>journal my stalls along holistic process<br>it does performance is also part of my<br>music method to age this performance<br>will show in a dance theater with<br>audiences and my examiner so that I can<br>show that really a performance of<br>absence from my key literature I've been<br>looking at ontology drawing references<br>on absence and presence I also looked at<br>calligraphy process ontology have been<br>divided into two parts to which the<br>ontology of being impressed is haunted<br>haunted indicates something that<br>happened before slide into presence -<br>which is before what has or absence is<br>not over and waiting for a chance to<br>return or to come back so why is hot<br>halogen meaningful for this research for<br>me it is an announcement of the return<br>of absence coming into presence and I<br>also look at minis<br>absence and presence have and by looking<br>at the word access means a lose of<br>something and nothing or something which<br>no longer exists presence on the other<br>hand means to be here or being here<br>they're totally adverse concepts but<br>they cannot be separated because without<br>absence presence is will lose a minute<br>and vice versa they have been looking at<br>different artistic disciplines and I've<br>been looking at what ages do by using<br>the concept of absence and presence in<br>their art practices visual artists for<br>example have been using the concept of<br>absence and presence to create image of<br>destroyed land or buildings or<br>environment as<br>Goodhead stated the disappearance or<br>absence of material can possibly evoke<br>or mark the fictional presence I also<br>look at the choreography process so that<br>I can make him micro buffet and it can<br>give me clear idea of how to make a crop<br>face of absence and how to structure it<br>into the research here comes to my<br>emerging ideas to explore or to perform<br>absence<br>we need to figure out what this absence<br>is worth what can be this absence I said<br>that during ah we need to send out a by<br>standing before it standing before<br>absence so from my understanding I think<br>is to send out weird absences by looking<br>effect or past I have given my dancers a<br>crook the task I ask them to write down<br>the significant moment in the history in<br>relation to absence right down to a<br>piece of paper and I can piece of paper<br>I ask them to create static positions<br>out of the sentence the growth and when<br>I got all the movement materials and I<br>put them into a paste and I cordon the<br>apart from sending it from history<br>absinthe can also be taken as a pastime<br>so to perform this pastime it is<br>necessary to create eight these other<br>time a time accuse of time a time when<br>past is no longer past and when present<br>is no longer present to perform this<br>time it's necessary to like the past<br>time to come to presence and to haunt us<br>so from this controlling haunting the<br>past time and possibly that is way to<br>return to the process to which I call<br>now let's talk about the significance of<br>the research so it benefits me and my<br>dancers and possibly audiences so that<br>they can have a new thought and<br>experience for understandings on the<br>concept of absence and presence it also<br>contributes to practice late research as<br>the new research approaches will be<br>found along with the process of the<br>research I am still studying the concept<br>absence impresses and I'm sure that<br>there still a lot of things with<br>infirmity discover and thank you all for<br>today and this is the end of my<br>presentation if you have any questions<br>thank you for the performance and big<br>presentation that's fantastic I'd like<br>to know how you chose to use a space to<br>convey your concept of absence yes<br>actually<br>the first time or I tried to develop a<br>taste of absence and presence is come to<br>my personal experience because like I'm<br>a dancer and I learned it in a really<br>long time and what time with my teachers<br>stretch in May and I was passed out and<br>at the time I felt like I am absent but<br>at the same time I'm still alive and<br>also present so that comes to my<br>interested make a pace of to perform<br>absences their presence yes it is a new<br>question<br>thank you very much that so I'm also<br>interested in absences and presences and<br>hauntings in my own work but in a very<br>different way and explain in through a<br>kind of written medium rather than<br>dancing I was kind of thinking about the<br>the differences like it's almost the<br>pros and cons of the different medians<br>in the sensor we've danced it must be an<br>enormous challenge to make present<br>things that are not physically here that<br>are absent to actually put them on stage<br>I'm curious about how you go about that<br>but also some of the benefits are dance<br>so that you know when I think about<br>absences in my own life they're very<br>they're very much felt I think of people<br>that are no longer with me or far away<br>they're things that hold me in a very<br>kind of emotional affective way so I'm<br>curious about what you think as dance as<br>being able to kind of enliven and point<br>to that actually I think because this is<br>just part of my career thing so and<br>originally this piece has seven dancers<br>so maybe when Alden are here this sense<br>of absence and presence could be a bit<br>more and it could be can be stronger and<br>I also have a saying of federal yes in<br>to mark the actually absence but<br>actually even the one is that is show<br>absence in your life but we can see like<br>remember her or Hank and we can still<br>remember the time when we were getting<br>together with her okay so which means<br>it's like not all the memories are sad<br>it's sometimes like we have happy happy<br>memories so I think the absence is what<br>makes us who we are today<br>yes so it's not about like the down or<br>so I really much enjoyed how you<br>integrated the oh you know you're right<br>narration there with your dancers I<br>thought that was quite different that<br>was money if he just told me the<br>significance of that piece there and<br>are talking the dancers came over and<br>interacted with you it is quite<br>different what I normally see in the<br>raishin being quite separate yes because<br>I think excess can me potentially a love<br>phase for example if I'm talking and<br>suddenly like I'm thinking other things<br>that's kind of absence if I'm presenting<br>my presentation and suddenly I've been<br>controlled or manipulated by others it's<br>also kind of absence because I'm not<br>focused on the presentation and more yes<br>so I think that just the one of the ways<br>to play with the concept of absence and<br>presence</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
