my<br>research so I'll start with us the<br>stream of war harshly sitting against<br>her skin formed a shadow on her hairy<br>lips the mapping of broken can bursts<br>get to the ground covering the direct<br>path of knowing droplets softening to<br>kiss the open floor melting icy floors<br>scatter along my feet walking I'm<br>cracking the surface of a chilly oasis I<br>see what you are I step from lily pad to<br>lily pad I treat every step with care to<br>prevent a bomb from erupting beneath<br>shift shift boom Raziel it gets Restless<br>and there I lay and lifting my gaze to<br>the sky and a small gesture in the pan<br>of openness start stillness the language<br>I hear the sharpness of tapping rended<br>repetitively the hum of the hard drive<br>the sketching of lead shielding its<br>weight penetrating as an expense<br>softened by the gentleness of the<br>tension of your group the dominant stare<br>of a black feathered magpie on the edges<br>of my fence the soft ears of a cat<br>carefully placing its pour the<br>watchfulness of a deer dashing in the<br>shadows I wait a moment for<br>transformation feeling my limbs try to<br>unfold and slay to reveal itself my<br>contours fold once more shift shift<br>I suck up the weight of its shape<br>resting in my hands the puddles of white<br>evaporate into thin air briskly<br>spreading my toes along white shells<br>that littered the edges of the lone tree<br>as I await the hand<br>I breathe in a rush of coldness to<br>my research explores three main ideas<br>sonography objects and relationships as<br>a choreographer I have used paper<br>because it relates to my careers about<br>the choreographic process and new ways<br>of generating innovative movement with<br>the body and an object and also the idea<br>of movement initiated writing so as you<br>can see that's how I've approached my<br>practice Lin research one practitioner<br>that I have stemmed my ideas from is<br>William Forsythe he is a choreographer<br>for Frankfort Ballet he was a<br>choreographer who recognized visual arts<br>and displaying theater beyond its means<br>and created new ways of knowing and new<br>ways of perceiving a performance in one<br>of his works named artifacts he lifted<br>the curtains up and down trying to get<br>the environment to change and get the<br>audience to see a dance beyond what the<br>conventional means of what it is one<br>thing I'll be talking about since it's a<br>shot such a short presentation is<br>scenography sonography is mentioned in<br>many forms and many fields and there are<br>diverse meanings for one in theatre it<br>is a lexicon of theatre making but in a<br>dance context it is shifting the<br>perception of body space and time and<br>igniting space so for me my piece is<br>named soma I try to change of shifts the<br>ideas of the conventional means or use<br>of paper and for me as I stand from this<br>query and interested in me and learning<br>to view objects and dance beyond<br>conventional means for instance looking<br>at a teacup beyond just simply just<br>holding tea I shift my ideas from two<br>novelists Gabrielle Marquez he was a<br>couple of Colombian novelist who wrote<br>the book 100 Years of Solitude the book<br>is based on gypsies and enlightened the<br>nature<br>of a small town Macondo it was about the<br>influence of one thing that things have<br>a life of their own and it's simply of a<br>matter of waking up their souls and<br>they'd leave me the question about a<br>book named all things an animal<br>vegetable and mineral it was a story<br>about Iceland and the nature of that<br>there was a character named Greta and<br>she journeyed the lands and she said<br>this things especially things that<br>appear to hold themselves in silence<br>must possess a power indifferent to<br>language something that comes from<br>themselves not via human allowance<br>silent things must be able to speak<br>exert agency propel narrative in the<br>context of sonography in my research one<br>can say the way that cohen describes the<br>objects are powerful things that are not<br>implying empowered by the activation of<br>humans but simply possess the power<br>within themselves and that is what i'm<br>looking at in my research if we go to<br>dance theorists there are two there<br>Miranda tough now and Chris crackme<br>Miranda is a dance that also a<br>craniosacral therapist she's based on<br>sensing the body and the practice of<br>that chris is a proto a practitioner who<br>works with visual arts and dance these<br>to say that shaping and reshaping the<br>landscape is an integral part of<br>improvisation people act upon their<br>world and are acted upon by a clock by<br>consistent dialogue as you can see the<br>paper will never be in the exact same<br>place every single time the stance has<br>never performed to the exact same time<br>but the question is how do you engage<br>yourself in a space when it is new it is<br>ignited and when there's a new but new<br>audience perceiving what you are doing<br>and that's my research thank you<br>oh I guess I'm so thank you very much<br>for that performance and so I was really<br>intrigued by your kind of relationship<br>with paper in the sense of year from as<br>an academic you in the social sciences<br>paper is something that I write on it's<br>something I project my ideas on is kind<br>of the vehicle which carries my ideas<br>it's not something that I would kind of<br>use in such a kind of creative ways that<br>was really an interesting shift in<br>perspective for me I have a question<br>about the choreography and particularly<br>kind of your emphasis on origami because<br>on the one hand it does have that<br>ability that fluidity when you look at<br>the kind of the finished piece of<br>origami I usually have these beautiful<br>lines but it's also very delicate and<br>deliberate and intentional practice very<br>kind of precise and I'm curious how when<br>you were kind of choreographed for this<br>piece how you managed to kind of get<br>that balance between both the fluidity<br>but also the very kind of jerking body<br>movements that kind of hints I think<br>that some of that intentionality<br>I think paper is a very dense material<br>and I think I was trying to balance it<br>out with the human body and the tactile<br>cues you can use to enable that idea of<br>when I pay for his folded its crinkled<br>and when it's straightened this fluid<br>those kind of feelings I wanted to evoke<br>through the movement and the<br>relationship with them that they asked<br>he should like my question actually kind<br>of builds on that so I noticed during<br>the performance there were phases where<br>the dancers were intertwined and there<br>were phases when they were completely<br>separated I was wondering what were the<br>ideas and themes that were driving this<br>fusion and expansion or separation<br>I used two stands so their journey so<br>they all have individual journeys as we<br>all do and they come together and<br>they're right they write a part of their<br>journey when they communicate through<br>dancing and when they leave each other<br>they obviously are affected by that in<br>some way shape or form as we all are we<br>have a conversation with someone will<br>remember it that's kind of how I've used<br>that to translate it in the dance if<br>that helps so it's more of a journey if<br>anything else is there a reason why you<br>chose to use the boat as your well the<br>hues of the color of paper represents a<br>journey of C initially because we don't<br>have a lot of time I sit out the place<br>as land mine so the paper represents<br>land and the space within that is the<br>water so the boats represent a journey<br>and how they carry themselves you know<br>for a time people use paper to hold<br>ideas and create structures such as the<br>origami do you think that's going to<br>change much when people start moving<br>into the digital world affects your<br>mindset I think that's a lot of the<br>reason why I am doing this and there's<br>research through dance because we often<br>video dance and we don't actually<br>perceive the meaning and emotion of that<br>and I think if you are able to write it<br>and paint that you can actually perceive<br>what someone's feeling but digitally I<br>don't think you can get as much of that<br>so that's what my research is trying to<br>promote because you don't feel the<br>experience and dance as an experience<br>yeah so I do think it will change so do<br>you think we lose a bit of self personal<br>connection migrating to digital<br>yes I do I do actually think it promotes<br>dance in a very great way but you don't<br>see behind the scenes and what people<br>actually feel when they create something<br>and I think that's a very important part</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
