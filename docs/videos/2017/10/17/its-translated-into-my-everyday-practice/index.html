We will use and model a range of teaching methods to spark and invigorate your teaching and deepen your understanding of education theory and methods, leading to a more satisfying and effective teaching and learning experience. http://bit.ly/2ztRArC</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I decided to<br>sign up to a paper at the University<br>because I haven't done any academic<br>learning for since I finished my medical<br>degree really and I was really keen to<br>find a new avenue in my work and<br>try and get the joy back into into<br>working and so I sort of went in search<br>of a course but then was helped a lot<br>once I sort of inquired initially it's<br>just sort of a direction and and which<br>paper might be suitable for me and then<br>saw ways so I went for the teaching and<br>learning paper and it's it's been really<br>great so far I've had I've met some<br>really nice like-minded people who are<br>looking for similar outcomes and it's<br>been quite transformative so far and<br>I've actually learnt a lot more than I<br>expected and has been much more<br>enjoyable and then I was initially<br>thinking so with the teaching and<br>learning paper I expected it to be sort<br>of quite specific to potentially say<br>teaching students but what it's actually<br>much broader and you learn a lot about<br>yourself<br>and I think it's translated into my<br>actual everyday practice so it helps me<br>relate to patients as well and I think<br>you know helps me enjoy my work more<br>because I'm I'm actually exploring my<br>understanding and my learning as well so<br>it's very broad sort of it's your own<br>learning in life as well and and I've<br>actually it's a very we've we've been<br>very practical and<br>through Ann and Martin our conveners<br>have been very keen to actually help us<br>apply it to our own practice rather than<br>it just being an academic thing so it's<br>actually made a lot of difference and<br>I've actually tested out things we've<br>learnt already and that's the whole<br>process of making it a safe way to<br>change and change your practice so<br>that's been much more than I expected<br>and I've yeah I'm really looking forward<br>to doing a lot more teaching in the<br>future</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
