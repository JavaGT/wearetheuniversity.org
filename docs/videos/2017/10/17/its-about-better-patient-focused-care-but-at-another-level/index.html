It is based on reflective practice and the translation of biomedical theory to day-to-day medical work.<br><br>GENA 820 provides a systematic review of the foundational concepts of medical practice; it aims to examine the academic and philosophic underpinning of modern medicine. http://bit.ly/2ygqYu7</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I've been working as a GP probably for<br>about about 12 years and enjoy the job<br>very much but was looking to do some<br>additional study and I have to say<br>nature of medicine was probably one of<br>the most inspiring courses I've done it<br>was collegial in the sense that group<br>just being with a group of other GPS at<br>a similar point in varying points early<br>in their careers was very refreshing and<br>it felt very supportive in terms of<br>developing new thinking about what<br>you're doing and new ways of approaching<br>practice it's it's very easy to sort of<br>get entrenched in a way of doing things<br>and when you work as a GP in a sort of a<br>silo quite often actually being amongst<br>of the GPS who've got a similar interest<br>in examining the way they're practicing<br>and the implications of practice was<br>really inspiring how has it changed my<br>practice um I get a lot more enjoyment<br>from my practice I enjoyed it before but<br>I enjoy even more now there are facets<br>to my practice which I didn't pay<br>significant attention to before which I<br>do now and I feel that actually I'm I'm<br>becoming more directed in my learning<br>with regard to future practice as well I<br>see the benefits of my learning on my<br>patients in terms of the time I I'm able<br>to give them and the focus that I can<br>direct with regard to their care I think<br>it's crystallite in my mind how I can<br>better serve my patients by being more<br>attuned to their needs and<br>it's developing better patient focused</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
