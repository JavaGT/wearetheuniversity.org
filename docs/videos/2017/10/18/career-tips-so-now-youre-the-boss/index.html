first-time managers experience, and help you identify ways to better manage them going forward.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so the first thing that I want to say<br>tonight is to just give you all a really<br>big round of applause because I've been<br>working and management leadership<br>development for a really long time now<br>and I have to say that anyone who will<br>take time out of their personal shear<br>jewels to come along and listen to<br>somebody talk about how you might become<br>a better manager is probably already<br>better than your average manager so<br>let's start off the ground before sit<br>down so I I was actually thinking about<br>it today I left the university I was a<br>lecturer in the management department<br>about 15 years ago and I went off into<br>the real world and got a real job and<br>worked with real leaders and real<br>managers and so what I'm going to<br>present to you tonight is not a series<br>of theoretical frameworks what I'm going<br>to present to you the kind of insights<br>from my own experience working with<br>first-time managers and I hope that that<br>you will find it useful I'm going to<br>talk for about an hour and then there<br>will be time for questions so do us what<br>it is that you want to know what we're<br>going to cover thank you to those who<br>filled in the survey I'm going to kind<br>of reflect some of what you told me back<br>to you so you know who was in the room<br>with you I'm going to talk a little bit<br>about what managers actually do because<br>I know that there are a number of people<br>here who are not yet managers who might<br>be a bit curious to know what that job<br>actually involves I'm going to talk<br>about this major transition that we make<br>when we become managers from being an<br>individual contributor to actually<br>managing people in some of the<br>challenges that that transition can<br>actually throw up I'm going to talk<br>about three common challenges for<br>first-time managers that I have observed<br>some of which came through in the survey<br>I'm gonna give you three frameworks that<br>you can try out the reason I'm giving<br>you different ways of looking at this is<br>that not everybody well everybody is<br>different<br>so everybody's approach to how they<br>develop themselves as a manager will be<br>different<br>so I want to give you some options in<br>terms of thinking about your development<br>as a manager and when we seen drowned<br>the sheets for tonight there will be a<br>couple of extra slides at the end of the<br>presentation which if you want to go<br>through in more detail one of the<br>frameworks that I'm going to present to<br>you it gives you some questions that<br>kind of guide you through a little bit<br>of deeper thinking on that<br>okay that clear awesome oh and audience<br>participation is required you know to<br>manage it's a verb it's a doing word so<br>you have to do something okay who are<br>you and why are you here so one thing<br>that I thought was kind of interesting<br>is that we actually have lots of newbies<br>people who are relatively new to<br>management about just over a third of<br>you we have a few of you who aren't<br>managers in a couple of HR managers who<br>don't manage people but have come along<br>to kind of learn what you guys actually<br>go through when you work into that role<br>oh no yeah I talking about<br>so not a manager 30% of you including -<br>so we've got very inexperienced people<br>and then we've got less than two years<br>so the most experienced of you are here<br>as well so we've kind of got both ends<br>of the spectrum what I find interesting<br>about that and I guess this is the first<br>insight I want to share is you never<br>really feel like you're doing a good job<br>it doesn't matter if you've been doing<br>it for two months or two years you'll<br>still be thinking I can get better at<br>this so if you're thinking you know I<br>don't know what I'm doing<br>don't worry that never goes<br>way you just get better at being okay<br>with that so how many people do you<br>directly manage so most people around<br>about one or two or three or four a<br>couple of your 10% of you nine or ten<br>people and your first management gig now<br>that's tough I don't know which company<br>is doing that to you whatever word with<br>the HR manager do you also manage people<br>as part of short-term projects so that's<br>in addition to your line manager<br>responsibilities you also manage people<br>and projects just over half of you now<br>why I asked that question is that that's<br>the future of Management that's the<br>future of leadership as organizations<br>evolve we're moving more and more to<br>being project based organizations which<br>means that you have to lead manage a<br>team of people that don't report to you<br>that you have no authority over so some<br>of the frameworks the techniques I'm<br>going to talk to you about today they go<br>across the spectrum so whether or not<br>you have any authority over the people<br>you're managing or whether you just need<br>to influence them some of the tips I'm<br>going to give you apply to both<br>two-thirds of you and ternal II promoted<br>into the role so that has its pluses and<br>it's minuses and then 60% of you now<br>manage people who were previously your<br>peers and again that can be a kind of a<br>so your three your top three number one<br>getting things done through other people<br>instead of doing it yourself now that's<br>a bit counterintuitive isn't it you kind<br>of think you've got all these people or<br>at least one or two that can do things<br>for you that should be a good thing but<br>it's difficult balancing the different<br>needs of your direct reports and then<br>letting your direct reports do things<br>the way that they want to instead of how<br>they would do it so what I really like<br>to just have spend a few minutes on now<br>is hearing from you and hearing why<br>these things are difficult who'd like to<br>kind of you know give a bit of an<br>example about why for example it's tough<br>to get things done through other people<br>you<br>yeah okay so lots and lots of reasons<br>that these three things might be<br>challenging and one thing that comes<br>through is different people might find<br>them challenging but for different<br>reasons so what do managers actually do<br>apart from now it's showing my age but<br>you know if you if you're laughing at<br>this you'll show your age too if you're<br>going through the if is that guy google<br>them so what do managers actually do so<br>part of the job that managers actually<br>do which first time managers sometimes<br>don't realize that there's a lot of<br>managing up so this is to do with<br>communicating to your direct manager<br>sometimes communicating further up the<br>organization some of the stuff that you<br>might be doing around performance<br>reviews or developmental discussions<br>that you're having with people that is<br>being fed into things further up in the<br>organization it's important information<br>for you know making decisions about<br>who's getting a bonus or who might be<br>you know tagged as a high potential or a<br>talent if you're customer-facing if your<br>team is customer-facing you might be a<br>really important channel of information<br>going up to the organization so that<br>they can make decisions and you may be<br>depending on the size and the complexity<br>of your organization contributing to<br>strategic discussions so at the same<br>time as you're having to manage your<br>day-to-day operational responsibilities<br>you're also having to kind of have that<br>big patch of you and actually be having<br>some of these discussions around what's<br>the organization actually trying to do<br>and not just what your team is trying to<br>do so in the same way that your<br>individual team member may not<br>understand what your entire team is<br>responsible for your team might not have<br>the view of what's actually going on at<br>the organizational level so managers<br>often have this kind of you know almost<br>split personality where they have to be<br>down in the detail<br>understanding you know kind of the<br>day-to-day operations but at the same<br>time thinking about that in a strategic<br>context if part of their role is to<br>actually contribute to those discussions<br>everybody's favorite compliance and<br>reporting so you know if you've got<br>budget responsibilities you actually<br>have to do something about that and fill<br>in lots of forms there's usually lots of<br>HR forms as well that you have to fill<br>in and you may have some operational<br>metrics depending on the organization<br>that you work for you might have lots of<br>admin to do if you're in a start-up you<br>know blessed startups you probably don't<br>have very much but as your organization<br>grows and becomes more successful you've<br>got all that to look forward to and then<br>you may be representing your<br>organization so at least you know if<br>you're leading a team and you're<br>interfacing with clients you have start<br>to have more responsibilities you know<br>you're not just representing yourself<br>now you're sort of seen as someone from<br>that organization within the industry<br>sector possibly within the recruitment<br>process so you know in that way you can<br>sometimes become part of the employer<br>brand as well so there's kind of a lot<br>that you do that you may not be aware of<br>and your capacity as a manager that you<br>may not have done prior to that and then<br>there's the kind of managing down and<br>this is the stuff this is really what<br>I'm going to focus on tonight because I<br>think a lot of first-time managers this<br>is where they sort of struggle a bit<br>more so things like cascading strategy<br>to your team so when we talk about you<br>know my team member doesn't understand<br>the big picture part of your<br>responsibility is to cascade that<br>strategy it's to help them understand<br>the big picture operationalizing the<br>strategy through your team so that's<br>around helping them understand what is<br>really important and should have a lot<br>of time spent on it versus you know what<br>isn't perhaps so important because it<br>actually doesn't contribute<br>the strategic goals at all they don't<br>know that they have no way of<br>determining that if you haven't helped<br>them understand that so that can be a<br>kind of real challenge to first-time<br>managers to realize that they are the<br>only channel through which that<br>communicating down particularly around<br>change there is an assumption at senior<br>levels that managers a part of<br>management and that means they will<br>assume that you will be on the side of<br>the decision-makers when it comes to a<br>change so there will be an expectation<br>that you will kind of implement whatever<br>decisions have been made and that can be<br>a real challenge at any level of<br>management if you haven't contributed to<br>the discussion or if you don't agree<br>with it hiring new employees you know<br>the first time you have to hire someone<br>that can be a bit scary evaluating<br>people particularly if those people were<br>your peers you know a couple of months<br>ago that can be a bit scary and then<br>developing people so both in terms of<br>the skills and knowledge that they need<br>to do the job in terms of understanding<br>what their aspirations are and where<br>they'd like to go with their career and<br>supporting them to do that and then<br>understanding what the organizational<br>goals are around developing the people<br>who work there because organizations<br>also have a a set of behaviors or skills<br>or knowledge that they want to build in<br>the organization to build capability and<br>since you're the person who probably<br>understands your team members the best<br>they're going to look to you to be<br>really instrumental and doing that and<br>you guys really matter you know in terms<br>of why people stay or leave with an<br>organization not liking their manager as<br>the number one reason so you can have<br>the best CEO in the world they can be<br>wandering around having visions<br>inspiring everyone but if you're T<br>member goes to work and has a day-in<br>day-out bad experience with the direct<br>manager they will be out the door so you<br>guys really really matter but don't say<br>all damn I told you that so individual<br>contributor to manager an individual<br>contributor now this is this is HR speak<br>but I hope it kind of makes sense so an<br>individual contributor is somebody in an<br>organization who just does a job they<br>have no responsibility for anybody else<br>they don't manage anybody they might<br>lead you know project teams every now<br>and again but by and large they come in<br>they do a job and they are acknowledged<br>and rewarded for doing that job if you<br>are the best individual contributor in<br>your team you may get promoted to<br>manager now even though we know that<br>this is often quite a bad idea because<br>the skills required to do your<br>individual contributor job and not the<br>same as required to do the manager job<br>organizations continue to do this<br>there's kind of this expectation that<br>just because you're good at one thing<br>you'll be good at something else and<br>some organizations do this quite well<br>they actually support people and they<br>may they may even make a conscious<br>choice not to promote that person to a<br>management role and promote somebody<br>else who they think actually is a better<br>manager who might not be the best<br>individual contributor but a lot of them<br>will just kind of go well you got the<br>best performance reviews for the last<br>three years you can have the job and<br>expect that you're just going to<br>continue to shine so what that can be<br>like if you don't kind of immediately<br>take to management is that you go from a<br>work experience where you are the star<br>performer you're used to being lavished<br>with praise you're used to being the<br>smartest person in the room the person<br>who comes up with the great ideas you<br>know who everybody turns to when there's<br>a tricky problem and then all of a<br>sudden you can't do<br>you have to do other people you have to<br>get things done through other people so<br>all those amazing skills and that<br>knowledge that you had when you're doing<br>your individual contributor role you<br>can't use it because now you have to<br>work with people who maybe you don't see<br>as being as competent as yourself you<br>have to develop them you have to be<br>really clear with them about what the<br>expectations are you have to kind of<br>bite your tongue and sit on your hands<br>while they struggle through because they<br>have to learn how to do that job now<br>because your new job is to manage them<br>that can be tough you used to be your<br>own advocate so you know you only really<br>had to look after yourself so if you<br>were having a discussion with your<br>manager or with somebody you would only<br>ever be representing your own point of<br>view so you know if you disagreed about<br>the direction that the team was taking<br>or you wanted to do a project in a<br>particular way you would just go and<br>make your case and then the manager<br>would have to balance the competing<br>views of your team members and come up<br>with some way to try and make you all<br>more or less happy or at least you know<br>unhappy but you know still productive<br>you were being used to being evaluated<br>and developed you know you'd go into<br>these conversations especially if you're<br>a superstar and you get your five or<br>whatever but you know you're a plus<br>whatever your evaluation was and then<br>your manager would say you know what<br>would you what would you like what are<br>your aspirations and you tell them and<br>then you know they kind of find a way to<br>help you get developed so you felt like<br>somebody took an interest in you and<br>that they really cared about you<br>but now that's your job so you know<br>these people come in and sometimes<br>you'll think they've got really<br>unrealistic expectations so you know<br>you'll ask them about their career<br>aspirations and they'll they'll tell I<br>see some knowing smiles going on<br>I'll tell you what their dreamers and<br>you'll be thinking oh my god never in a<br>million years but you can't say that at<br>least not in those words so you have to<br>start you know thinking okay I need to I<br>need to respect this person's their<br>dream their vision and I need to think<br>about how I can actually help them to<br>you know go along that path you used to<br>be accountable for your own performance<br>and that if you still in that position<br>there is really gold because it means<br>that you get a lot of flexibility so you<br>know if you're the kind of person who<br>likes to leave everything to the last<br>minute get the adrenaline rush on and<br>then kind of hit that deadline pulling<br>it on all-nighter to get something done<br>on time when it was just you you could<br>do that because you knew I'm gonna get<br>this done right now you're responsible<br>for your team's performance so you've<br>got two to ten people who might all be<br>thinking I've got this I can get this<br>done but you don't see any of them doing<br>anything because they're not doing it<br>the way that you would do it right so<br>you're kind of like depending on your<br>own if you know on your own style you<br>might be kind of ringing them up every<br>five minutes or texting them or saying<br>have you done this and they're kind of<br>like yeah yeah I'm totally on top of it<br>but you don't believe them or they might<br>be coming to you when you're thinking<br>this is not important this is not a<br>priority but they it's a priority to<br>them so they're banging on your door<br>every five minutes wanting to get some<br>feedback so you have to manage them<br>doing the things that they need to do so<br>that your team can deliver the outcomes<br>that it needs to do and that can be<br>really tough a lot of people who are<br>individual contributors are specialists<br>and when you go to become a manager you<br>become a generalist and that's not just<br>on the people side of Management but<br>that's also you know if you're then<br>having to do budgeting and you know<br>filling in these<br>and of forms and learning more about how<br>the business actually operates and often<br>you won't actually get any training to<br>do that so you kind of be told that you<br>have to do it but you don't really<br>understand why it's important and you<br>don't really understand how but you just<br>know that you have to do it because<br>people keep harassing you for it and<br>reminding you of the deadlines but at<br>the same time you also need to deliver<br>what it is that your team needs to<br>deliver and then for some people there<br>can be a bit of an identity kind of<br>shift you know when you're a worker when<br>you're part of the team you can have a<br>lot of kind of camaraderie and get along<br>really well with people talk about your<br>lives outside of work and when you<br>become part of Management especially if<br>you've been promoted ahead of your peers<br>sometimes you can feel that as a loss so<br>it depends a little bit on the<br>relationships but sometimes a trust that<br>was previously there may get a little<br>bit kind of shaken because you have been<br>promoted so people might just start to<br>watch what they say around you you might<br>have to start to watch what you say<br>around them because sometimes you will<br>have information that you can't share<br>and so it can it can just be a little<br>bit uncomfortable until you figure out<br>how you're actually going to manage that<br>so three of the common challenges that<br>that I've observed that first time<br>managers really struggle with the first<br>is around having to bathe and reflected<br>glory so this is you by the way you're<br>the shadow this is the new superstar<br>individual contributor on your team<br>because if you are a really really good<br>manager and you get things done through<br>other people your team will shine now<br>you'll get the credit but it's not the<br>same as being in the spotlight some<br>people really struggle with that and I<br>I've actually got a couple of people<br>that I went through University Worth who<br>were always the smartest person in the<br>room always the smartest person in the<br>room<br>and as we've you know we've stayed in<br>touch with stayed friends and as they've<br>gone on in their career the biggest<br>challenge for them has been when they've<br>actually got promoted and moved into<br>these management roles because all of a<br>sudden they can't be the smartest person<br>in the room you know they actually have<br>to keep their mouth shut keep their<br>opinions to themselves and let other<br>people shine and that's a real challenge<br>especially if you've had 10 or 15 years<br>of being that person and then all of a<br>sudden you know you're not that person<br>anymore<br>this one being the meat in the sandwich<br>this can be a real challenge where<br>you've got you know the pressure coming<br>down from the top you have to do this<br>you have to deliver that you know this<br>is your priority and then you've got<br>your team kind of coming at you from the<br>other side I want this I want that this<br>person's not doing what they're supposed<br>to and you just feel like leave me alone<br>but you know they won't so somehow you<br>have to kind of manage that it can also<br>feel a little bit like that if you are<br>in the team where the team members are<br>not getting along with each other or<br>they're kind of having some issues and<br>you can see everybody's point of view<br>but somehow they expect you to resolve<br>it they can't quite figure out how to do<br>it on their own and then there are<br>having difficult conversations now<br>what's a difficult conversation for one<br>person may not be a difficult<br>conversation for another person but<br>where I've noticed most people will say<br>they have some difficulty around<br>performance conversations so how do you<br>actually evaluate somebody and then how<br>do you actually give that feedback to<br>them in a way that it's constructive and<br>they actually value it motivating people<br>some people will find that quite<br>challenging<br>we tend to attribute a lot to people's<br>motivations so often we judge people's<br>behavior based on our on what we look<br>like when we're motivated and how we<br>behave so if somebody isn't<br>demonstrating that same behavior we<br>might think that they're not motivated<br>and we might want to talk to them but we<br>don't really know how development<br>conversations now you would think these<br>would be the easy ones right because<br>these are the positive ones these are<br>all about where are you going in your<br>career how can I kind of help you but<br>there can be difficult for a couple of<br>reasons one is you may not know how to<br>help them so sometimes it might be about<br>accessing training but more often than<br>not it's actually about how can you<br>provide some on-the-job experience that<br>will help that person develop how might<br>you be able to kind of coach them or<br>mentor them and then there's the part<br>that people don't always talk about and<br>that's the part that I see a lot of<br>because I often work with high<br>potentials the the people that we want<br>to develop into future leadership roles<br>and they're often you know the brightest<br>the best the the best person in that<br>team and the reason that the managers<br>don't want to talk to them about it it's<br>because they don't want to lose them so<br>you can actually be in this really<br>difficult situation where you've got a<br>bit of a conflict of interest got this<br>amazing person in their tea and your<br>team fantastic skills they're really<br>ambitious you know they want to kind of<br>grow and stretch their wings and you<br>kind of want to help them but you don't<br>really want to lose them because then<br>you've got a big problem you've got a<br>hole to fill so actually balancing your<br>own interests against their interest can<br>be a real a real challenge and then I<br>had one more which I like to go and look<br>up like ember<br>Oh delegation how could I forget<br>delegation so actually deciding what it<br>is that you want people to do in<br>communicating they're in such a way that<br>they are really clear on what you want<br>when you want it what good looks like<br>but in such a way that you don't come<br>across as some kind of control freak<br>micromanager so delegating is really<br>quite tricky for a lot of people so what<br>I'm going to do now is I'm going to<br>present you three different frameworks<br>and we might do a bit of interaction<br>I've been told you don't like to<br>interact but so the first framework i've<br>called start with yourself and the key<br>takeaway is to remember that half of<br>management is self-management The<br>Situation's you find yourself in aren't<br>necessarily a problem it's how you<br>actually respond to them that makes you<br>feel like they're a problem or not so<br>one thing that's really important<br>particularly when you're you're starting<br>out is to really start to understand<br>yourself and how you're responding to<br>situations and one way to start to do<br>this is to identify your triggers so<br>want you all to think back to the to the<br>last time you had a bit of a wobble in<br>your in your management role and I want<br>you to think about what happened and how<br>did you feel in that situation and you<br>can talk to the person next to you I<br>know scary right talking about feelings<br>so sometimes we actually get really<br>freaked out and that's one of the<br>reasons they called the session and<br>you're and you're kind of freaking out<br>because what happens when we find<br>ourselves in uncomfortable situations is<br>that it actually triggers a part of the<br>brain that's responsible for the stress<br>response so who's had a situation<br>whereby you know you've been doing a<br>piece of work and you know you've<br>totally been on fire you know you've<br>come up with some great idea and you<br>know your brains just been firing on all<br>cylinders and you think I'll share this<br>with the team and they're going to think<br>I'm the best manager ever and you go in<br>and you present your idea and there's<br>like a stony silence or they immediately<br>start pulling it apart so what tends to<br>happen in that situation is that the<br>part of the brain that was really<br>awesome and terms of doing this piece of<br>work goes to lunch and the part of the<br>brain that I call the baby brain some<br>people call it the reptilian brain as<br>where the amygdala is and that<br>responsible for the triggering the<br>stress response and that part of the<br>brain is really bad at understanding<br>what you're actually dealing with so it<br>can't distinguish this between someone<br>making a helpful suggestion or giving<br>you a piece of constructive criticism<br>and a threat to your life so what<br>happens yeah how phones aren't that's<br>not so one can often happen is that when<br>you're in these uncomfortable or new<br>situations is that you are general<br>generally or genuinely freaking out so<br>your brain is going oh my god I'm under<br>threat I don't know how to deal with<br>this and so you deal with it through<br>either fight or flight which is the<br>stress response so some people in that<br>situation they come out fighting right I<br>see a few nods right somebody challenges<br>me well back up I'm going to challenge<br>you back so the team member says<br>have you thought of this and well of<br>course I've thought of this and you know<br>who are you to speak to me like that and<br>blah blah blah right you come down on<br>them like a ton of bricks<br>other people they go as a flight route<br>so somebody challenges them as a manager<br>and they don't hold their ground they<br>kind of freak out and they kind of go<br>okay well we'll put this up next week<br>and then they never speak of it again<br>neither of these responses are terribly<br>functional so one of the things that is<br>really important when you find yourself<br>in these situations and it's not just<br>going to be with your direct reports<br>this is going to be with anyone you work<br>with is that you recognize when you get<br>triggered so which of these kind of<br>challenging situations really triggers<br>you and try to think about why now<br>usually it'll be some sense that you're<br>being threatened now if you are already<br>feeling a little bit unsecured about<br>your position and somebody questions you<br>you might immediately start to think<br>that they're threatening you that they<br>don't think that you deserve the job<br>you're not legitimate you know you can<br>see how this would happen especially if<br>you've been in a situation you've been<br>promoted ahead of your peers but they're<br>probably not actually threatening you<br>that is asking you a question<br>so one of the key skills that you can<br>learn is to recognize when you've been<br>triggered and come up with some<br>strategies for how you might actually<br>respond in that situation so some stock<br>phrases are really helpful you know if<br>you're in a meeting you've presented an<br>idea people are questioning you rather<br>than responding you just say okay you<br>know thanks for your feedback I'll take<br>that on board it's enough you've<br>acknowledged what's been said and then<br>you can kind of go away and have a think<br>about it so that's that's kind of step<br>one identify what really kind of freaks<br>you out in this role and try and get to<br>why what's actually going on here the<br>second one that's really important is to<br>focus on what you can control or<br>influence so if you have a team<br>for example who just drives you nuts<br>because they're always focusing on<br>something that you don't think is<br>important maybe have a think about<br>whether they actually understand what's<br>important because you might actually be<br>able to influence them by spending a bit<br>more time with them now this I see this<br>happen a lot actually and I see this<br>happen at the very senior levels as well<br>so this is a skill that you can master<br>now you will find you know leadership<br>through the levels a lot easier so don't<br>waste time on things that you can't<br>control so if a decision comes down the<br>line and you can't change it<br>just accept it right you have to<br>communicate<br>perhaps imperfect information perhaps<br>you don't really understand what's going<br>on<br>so you can't do anything about that the<br>team members might be asking you give me<br>more information tell me what's going to<br>happen here you can't control that but<br>what you can control is how you respond<br>in that situation so you can say I don't<br>have all the information but I will let<br>you know as soon as I do<br>rather than trying to make stuff up or<br>try to avoid the conversation or putting<br>them off until you think that you'll<br>have the information which is often what<br>people do because they feel like they're<br>responsible for not having this<br>information even though it isn't<br>actually their fault so really focus in<br>on what you can control so the first<br>thing you can control is your own<br>response so think about if there's a<br>pattern of situations where you always<br>behave in the same way and it's not<br>really working for you and think about<br>some different ways that you might<br>behave and then think about what you can<br>actually influence so with other people<br>particularly with direct reports think<br>about what it is that they're doing that<br>you would like them to change and you<br>know have those conversations usually<br>it's around clarity usually people<br>behave in ways<br>that we don't expect because they're not<br>really clear on what we expect from them<br>so investing that time can be really<br>important and then you know just don't<br>worry too much about it treat every<br>situation as an opportunity to learn now<br>this is one of my favorite quotes<br>experience is what you get when you<br>don't get what you want so every time<br>you hear about you know a really<br>experienced manager just think how many<br>times that person didn't get what they<br>wanted that's how you get experience you<br>have to learn but to learn you have to<br>reflect so if something happens and<br>things didn't go the way that you wanted<br>to actually have a think about why and<br>you know this may be something that you<br>can discuss with your own manager it may<br>be something that you could discuss with<br>the mentor or even just with your peers<br>sometimes if you're really brave you<br>could even discuss it with the person<br>that looked the other person that was<br>involved in it and I've seen some real<br>breakthroughs and and manager direct<br>reports from doing just that situations<br>occurred you both know it hasn't gone<br>well but rather than actually just kind<br>of ignoring that and trying to sweep it<br>under the rug you actually say look you<br>know what happened there how can we be<br>better in the future and if you come at<br>it like let's learn from this rather<br>than you were wrong and I was right or<br>being really critical you can actually<br>kind of chalk it up to experience and<br>and you move on has anyone got any<br>so the second framework is it's a it's<br>actually originally a framework for<br>motive understanding motivation<br>understanding what motivates people but<br>I think that it applies really well in<br>terms of understanding what people need<br>in order to feel motivated at work and<br>where I really like this is that if you<br>apply it to yourself you can also start<br>to understand why you might not be<br>enjoying your job as much as you thought<br>you would so I'll talk you through each<br>of the components and then we'll apply<br>them to a team member and we'll apply<br>them to yourself so the first thing that<br>we all need in order to feel good about<br>ourselves is autonomy and what that<br>means is we need a sense that we have<br>choices and that we can act so your team<br>members need to feel that they have some<br>autonomy so who can tell me the best way<br>so yes micromanage autonomy is really<br>really important and it relates to a<br>person's sense of agency and<br>particularly if you're working with you<br>know creative types people who are<br>knowledge workers professionals people<br>who are kind of really proud of their of<br>their skills and knowledge and you start<br>telling them exactly how to do something<br>and you start telling them exactly how<br>to do it the way you would do it what<br>you're essentially doing is taking away<br>their autonomy so if they do it they<br>will resent it and if they don't do it<br>you then suddenly find yourself with a<br>bit of an issue you might have a bit of<br>a battle of wills so one of the things<br>that's<br>important with your team members is to<br>be clear on what you need to be clear on<br>and what you need to be clear on as what<br>as expected so what do they need to<br>deliver by when how will you know it's<br>good enough and you need to invest the<br>time and having those conversations<br>because they need to be able to ask<br>questions you need to be able to agree<br>timeframes you need to be able to answer<br>specific questions and if you if you're<br>constantly having the experience whereby<br>more than one of your team members is<br>delivering what you weren't expecting<br>this might be an area where you need to<br>work to be really you know devote a bit<br>more time to really being clear on<br>things but don't tell them how to do it<br>you know don't say so I need you to<br>deliver this report by Friday at three<br>o'clock and I think you should use this<br>and do that and go and say this and go<br>and do this one and the rest of it now<br>if you can't help yourself<br>stock phrase you know and a good stock<br>phrase is to communicate the information<br>to be clear and say is there anything<br>that you need from me that gives them an<br>opportunity to say have you got any<br>suggestions about where I might find<br>this information or who I might talk to<br>and then you get to tell them what to do<br>because they've asked you so you're<br>helping you're not micromanaging so if<br>you're the kind of person who likes to<br>be really specific and give really<br>detailed instructions and it's not<br>helping then just turn it around and put<br>it as a question to your team member is<br>there anything that I can help you with<br>is there anything that you need from me<br>then they get to ask so they retain<br>their sense of autonomy now of course<br>when we apply it to to ourselves as a<br>manager we also understand why being a<br>manager might not be that much fun<br>because we never go from being an<br>individual contributor where you're able<br>to kind of control your own workflow and<br>do<br>the way that you want to becoming a<br>manager when you're much more at the<br>beck and call of either the people above<br>you or the people below you a lot of<br>your own autonomy can go and<br>interestingly as you rise even further<br>up the ranks you can lose a lot of<br>autonomy even over simple things like<br>how you spend your day if you get an<br>executive assistant and they start<br>scheduling your appointments and you<br>really have no idea what you're doing at<br>2:30 that can actually be a bit of a you<br>know a mind shift as well so autonomy we<br>need to make sure that our our team<br>members feel that they have agency that<br>they're in control of their work and of<br>their lives but we also have to<br>recognize where our own and security<br>might be coming from a sense that we're<br>kind of losing control of our own<br>situation and you know if there is an<br>issue if thinking about how can we<br>retain some sense of autonomy in a way<br>that's different to where we used to get<br>relatedness who here is always too busy<br>to talk to their team who always<br>reschedules the one-to-ones and you know<br>kind of to people I've just got to<br>finish this just got to finish this and<br>focus is on a task instead of focusing<br>on the relationships ok good one honest<br>to honest people<br>so here's the thing relatedness is key<br>to trust Trust is key to performance<br>it's the most important thing and what's<br>coming out from every kind of leader<br>with this salt I was reading today the<br>head of Deloitte and the u.s. saying<br>always put the people first if somebody<br>needs you you need to invest in the<br>relationship and the task can wait now<br>as a manager that's really really<br>important and I would say it's most<br>important when you first get into the<br>job and that's really tricky because<br>when you first get into the job you're<br>trying to figure out how the stupid ASAP<br>system works and you know why you have<br>to fill<br>ten million forms to hire someone and<br>you know and it's really difficult when<br>you've got all these new tasks that you<br>have to do to actually go no you know<br>what I'm not gonna do any of that I'm<br>going to invest time and getting to know<br>my people<br>and when I say getting to know them I<br>mean really kind of getting to know them<br>so actually understanding you know who<br>they are why they work there what they<br>like about their roles how they like to<br>be managed I found through trial and<br>error that that's a really good question<br>to ask each person when I take over a<br>new team how do you like to be managed<br>and then you can say this is how I like<br>to manage and if they're not<br>complementary styles you can have a<br>discussion right at the beginning about<br>what issues might come up and how you<br>might manage that relationship going<br>forward if you don't do relatedness then<br>you will not only not have have a lot of<br>trust in your team but you will also<br>find that it's very difficult to create<br>the kind of open team culture that you<br>need for people to be really honest and<br>to give feedback because generally<br>speaking we're only honest with people<br>that we trust and we only trust people<br>that we've got a relationship with now<br>it can be a bit awkward and New<br>Zealanders are not great at this sort of<br>stuff but I really do want to encourage<br>you to have a go because it will reap<br>the biggest return when you apply it to<br>the new manager we also see that there's<br>there's a big loss here you know you've<br>gone from being part of a team having<br>that camaraderie having people that you<br>can talk to and now you might be on your<br>own and you haven't yet established peer<br>relationships with other managers so you<br>might find yourself feeling a little bit<br>like you don't have anyone that you can<br>actually talk to you know the people<br>that you might have talked to you<br>previously you can't talk to them<br>anymore because they're the people you<br>want to talk about<br>and so you have to you have to go and<br>find some other people and this is where<br>it can be you know really useful to tap<br>into any networks that might be R in<br>your organization you know other people<br>at your level or even to just you know<br>seek out other managers at your level<br>and say you know Joanna have a coffee or<br>something kind of create that sort of<br>informal support network if you don't<br>have it provided for you<br>and then there's competence so we all<br>need to feel competent we all need to<br>feel like we've got at something but a<br>lot of us weren't trained to focus on<br>people's confidence we weren't trained<br>to focus on what they're doing well we<br>were folk we were trying to focus on you<br>know what the problem is or what the<br>issue is or the 5% of something that<br>wasn't perfect not the 95 percent of<br>something that was so our initial<br>reaction is often to be critical and of<br>course if we do this a lot then people<br>will start to feel like they're not good<br>enough like they're not actually doing a<br>very good job so one way that we can<br>kind of help people feel more competent<br>is to give them constructive praise so<br>always find something and you can always<br>find something that somebody is doing<br>really well or you can acknowledge a<br>behavior that even if you don't<br>particularly like it you can acknowledge<br>the value of it you know so if you've<br>got someone who is kind of you know you<br>think they're a little bit too laid-back<br>and relaxed you can acknowledge that<br>that's actually quite helpful sometimes<br>you know when everyone else is having<br>total freakout and being a little bit<br>irrational that this person might<br>actually bring some balance to the team<br>so it really encourage you to try and<br>find something in each of your team<br>members that you can praise them for<br>that you can acknowledge as an area in<br>which they are really<br>really competent and then of course if<br>there are other areas where you think<br>that they need to develop it's much<br>easier for them to kind of take that<br>feedback because they're not feeling<br>like you're just constantly criticizing<br>them and then when we apply this you<br>know to ourselves as new managers what<br>we find is that a lot of new managers<br>feel like they're failing all the time<br>because the things that they used to be<br>good at they don't get to do the things<br>that they are trying to do now they<br>they're struggling with and no one's<br>telling them that they're doing a good<br>job you know the team the direct reports<br>might just complain all the time if<br>you're lucky they might complain to your<br>face if you're unlucky they might<br>complain to your boss which happened to<br>a woman I'm working with recently and<br>you know you can you can start to feel<br>pretty sure about yourself so it's also<br>important to acknowledge that and to<br>recognize where you are on that journey<br>so you know if no one else is giving you<br>the praise then you need to find<br>something to kind of high-five yourself<br>about you know what have you actually<br>done that was good you know and it might<br>might be a little thing but there will<br>be something that you're doing in your<br>role that you're doing really really<br>well and you need to acknowledge that<br>for yourself and not not beat yourself<br>up about you know the learning<br>experiences you've been having during<br>so the third framework is my kind of you<br>know when in doubt framework one of the<br>assumptions a lot of people make when<br>they move into management is that they<br>have to make all the decisions on their<br>own so we often hear you know people<br>talk about I need to delegate I need to<br>delegate I need to decide and I need to<br>delegate but there is often contentious<br>and it's often quite tricky and<br>particularly if you have a team of<br>people<br>who<br>and not working very well together what<br>that can do as it creates a kind of<br>dynamic where here's you in the middle<br>and then you talk to this person and<br>this person talks to you and you talk to<br>that person and they talk to you and<br>there you talk to that person they talk<br>to you but they never talk to each other<br>so you actually don't form as a team and<br>what that means is that you foster an<br>over dependency on you so any little<br>problem they'll come to you to solve if<br>they're having a problem with that<br>person they'll come to you and expect<br>you to solve it so my kind of you know<br>management hack for that is to always<br>share the problem you know because a<br>problem shared is a problem halved so<br>whatever it is that your team has to<br>deliver involving team members in the<br>decision-making process in the deciding<br>who does what is kind of going to help<br>you start to build that kind of<br>environment and which team members start<br>to feel ownership for what you're doing<br>and they also start to build these<br>relationships with each other so that<br>they won't always come to you which<br>means that you can have time to do some<br>of the other things that you need to be<br>doing while they're actually doing the<br>work so you know the main reason that<br>managers don't do that often is because<br>they're worried that they they'll seem<br>incompetent that it kind of looks like<br>they don't know what they're doing so if<br>they ask everybody else you know it's<br>kind of like I'm not I'm not being<br>professional right I'm not a good<br>manager but it's actually the opposite<br>and what we're seeing in the leadership<br>literature around who are the most<br>effective leaders its these leaders who<br>practice what what's now been called<br>inclusive leadership that get the best<br>results so they don't assume this<br>position of authority they don't assume<br>that they know everything and that they<br>can you know are the best place to kind<br>of dish out the work what they see their<br>role as this kind of facilitator you've<br>got this pool or team of talented people<br>who are there and you are to work<br>together to kind of deliver whatever<br>that team needs to<br>do so your main role is facilitating<br>that process and including people is<br>really key to that sharing when you<br>don't have all the answers there's also<br>a really great way to build trust<br>because it also creates this kind of<br>openness in this environment in which<br>people can be really honest so if you<br>say I don't you know I'm really open to<br>suggestions I'm not entirely sure how we<br>should do this people can not only<br>provide their contribution so that they<br>feel like they you know they're valuable<br>and have a sense of confidence<br>themselves but it also opens up that<br>conversation so that they will be more<br>likely to tell you when they're<br>struggling a little bit which means that<br>you don't have that situation where<br>somebody is working on a task<br>unbeknownst to you they don't really<br>know what they're doing and so you don't<br>find out until it's kind of too late<br>so it's about kind of you know building<br>these kind of open relationships and<br>communication within your team<br>reflecting as well is really really<br>important so sometimes we get really<br>caught up in the day-to-day doing so<br>we're just like running from doing one<br>thing to doing another and we're not<br>actually spending that time reflecting<br>on what went well or what didn't well I<br>didn't well well it didn't go well and<br>that's actually really key and as you<br>start to move higher and higher up the<br>chain carving at that time to sort of<br>reflect on what's actually going on in<br>this situation is going to become more<br>important because if you can start to<br>identify a pattern or start to identify<br>you know where your behavior may be<br>contributing to the situation and you<br>can change that you'll actually learn<br>and then that's actually how you grow<br>and develop as a manager and of course<br>you know being inclusive it's a leap of<br>faith<br>I won't kind of lie about that because<br>sometimes you don't know what you're<br>going to get back and if you are used to<br>being kind of the most competent person<br>in the room opening this up and<br>including people and taking on board<br>these suggestions<br>beat right up but it will build trust<br>and your people even if they don't<br>always like what you do or what you say<br>or the decisions that you make they will<br>trust the process by which you manage<br>them any questions about that one so<br>this is an option if you want to I'll<br>just show you where I have them so<br>there's two slides which will come out<br>when the notes come around tomorrow what<br>you can work through if you want to and<br>what I've suggested is that you can<br>write yourself a memo to just jot down<br>one thing you learned in this workshop<br>about yourself so that's where if you<br>want to kind of work this work through a<br>few questions on this have a look at<br>those additional slides one thing you<br>could do to create an arc experience for<br>a team member so if there's someone in<br>your team that you might have been<br>ever-so-slightly micromanaging you know<br>maybe there's a way you can pull back on<br>that and one way you're going to be more<br>inclusive and how you manage your team<br>and then you know put that into practice<br>because as I said before you know to<br>manage it's a verb it's a doing word so<br>until you actually kind of get stuck in<br>and start trying some of these<br>techniques and seeing what works for you<br>reflecting on that experience and if it<br>didn't work don't beat yourself up<br>remember you're just becoming an<br>experience manager try something else<br>and just keep trying things until you<br>kind of figure out what's your style of<br>management because this is the other<br>kind of golden takeaway there is no one<br>best way to manage you know you bring<br>your personal characteristics you bring<br>your own experience you bring your<br>preferences and then you interact with<br>other people who bring all of that as<br>well so it's always a negotiation it's<br>always a navigation</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
