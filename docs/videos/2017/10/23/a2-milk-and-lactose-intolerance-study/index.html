font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we know that dairy has been an important<br>source of nutrition for people for a<br>long time that's the first food we have<br>as an infant as we grow older many of us<br>don't tolerate dairy so well I have had<br>as she was drinking regular milk pretty<br>much all through high school and into<br>college I get floated a lot of abdominal<br>cramps and I usually just try to stay<br>away from it about 70% of the people<br>globally lactose-intolerant they tend to<br>therefore avoid dairy so when they drink<br>milk<br>they have unpleasant response it might<br>be they feel that nausea source um<br>bloating and obviously the best way to<br>avoid that is to avoid drinking milk but<br>by doing that they're avoiding some of<br>the important nutritional components of<br>milk we know that a lot of people report<br>having trouble consuming dairy and so we<br>wanted to investigate what it is about<br>dairy that causes them problems so we<br>had people come in that already said<br>that they have trouble and we looked to<br>see whether they were lactose intolerant<br>first and then we gave them a couple<br>different types of milk to see if we<br>could identify what it was about the<br>milk that was causing them trouble we<br>want to understand the selectorized<br>intolerance a bit better we think that<br>some of these people who believe they're<br>lactose intolerant may in fact be<br>intolerant to a protein component of the<br>milk and if we can understand it better<br>we might be able to enable them to enjoy<br>milk which they are currently avoiding<br>what we wanted to test was first look at<br>how these people responded to regular<br>milk and we compared that with lactose<br>free milk since we know lactose might be<br>something that causes trouble we also<br>compared it to a - milk so a - milk has<br>a different type of protein than<br>conventional milk about ten thousand<br>years ago all cows produced a tuned milk<br>so a - refers to the bTW casein protein<br>but sometime after that a mutation<br>occurred and that resulted in a<br>different version of this protein which<br>is called the a1 version and what we<br>understand is that most people can<br>tolerate the a2 vision well we think<br>that some people don't tolerate the a1<br>version as well and what we did was they<br>had them drink this large amount of milk<br>so 750 milliliters about three glasses<br>and then we looked at their body's<br>response really importantly we had them<br>report how they were feeling after<br>drinking these different types of milk<br>so we wanted them to report how much<br>stomach pain they had<br>how much bloating they were feeling or<br>if they were feeling nauseous to see if<br>they had different responses to each of<br>the types of milks what we think is that<br>some people respond differently to the<br>a1 version and what they perceived to be<br>lactose intolerance may in fact be a<br>reaction to the a1 version this might<br>result in some intestinal inflammation<br>and lead to symptoms which they think<br>are due to lactose intolerance but may<br>in fact be due to that a1 version of the<br>beta casein lactose intolerant women<br>actually reported more similar symptoms<br>with a2 milk as with lactose free milk<br>compared to conventional milk so with<br>conventional milk they experienced more<br>nausea and abdominal pain throughout the<br>course of 12 hours but with a2 milk they<br>actually had fewer of these symptoms<br>quite similar to with lactose free milk<br>this indicates that there is something<br>different going on aside from just<br>removing the lactose who may be able to<br>alleviate some of these symptoms by<br>changing the type of protein in the milk<br>what this means for someone with lactose<br>intolerance is that there's another<br>option aside from removing the lactose<br>and milk for them to choose so with a<br>two milk we know that on a single<br>occasion that's going to alleviate some<br>of the symptoms that they may be<br>experiencing and what we want to look at<br>in the next study is to see whether<br>there might actually be longer term<br>effects of reducing something like<br>inflammation with a2 milk which you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
