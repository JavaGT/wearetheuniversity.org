New Zealanders will need novel technologies to meet the nation’s goal of removing invasive mammalian predators by 2050. ‘Daisy drive’ systems could help by spreading genes causing infertility through local invasive populations. Because the technology aims to alter the shared environment, all research should be open and community guided.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

us on behalf of the<br>University of Otago and the Ellen Wilson<br>Center at Otago in the biological<br>heritage National Science Challenge who<br>have sponsored this I welcome you all to<br>this event so gene drives perhaps one of<br>the most exciting but also potentially<br>terrifying technologies that we have at<br>our disposal and we are currently<br>thinking about using these and the<br>context of eliminating predators within<br>New Zealand<br>and so I think many of you here tonight<br>will be interested in that particular<br>application but also perhaps interested<br>to hear exactly how it might work and<br>also how we might control it so Kevin if<br>felt will be known to many of you who<br>have been following his work as one of<br>the pioneers and the area of gene drives<br>and their application for well in fact<br>actually their application and keep many<br>of the revolutions in thinking over the<br>last two and a half years and it is only<br>two and a half years maybe maybe if we<br>if we stretch at three years since the<br>gene Drive concept was first published<br>by Kevin and some others and within that<br>intervening time there has been a<br>revolution of application and<br>laboratories and now perhaps the<br>consideration of application into the<br>field but I'm going to leave Kevin to<br>tell you about his thoughts on this<br>matter and also to give you some ideas<br>about how he thinks this might be<br>applied in a New Zealand context and to<br>get some feedback from you about your<br>thoughts around the use of that<br>technology and the New Zealand context<br>so without further ado I do I'll<br>introduce Kevin who's an assistant<br>professor at MIT and the scoping<br>evolution lab and the MIT Media Lab<br>and welcome you to New Zealand until<br>University of Otago thank you Kevin well<br>thank you Neil for the kind introduction<br>and thank you all for coming out here on<br>a Sunday evening to discuss some science<br>I confess that this is not so much for<br>me to tell you about the science as it<br>is for me to ask you for your advice<br>about the science and where it might go<br>and whether it might be suitable for use<br>here you know Tara this is because<br>having played at least a minor role in<br>developing these I firmly believe that<br>scientists should hold themselves<br>responsible for all consequences of<br>their work and that means that I'm<br>hoping that you can offer some<br>assistance in terms of guide guiding us<br>towards potentially wise applications of<br>these technologies or wisely refraining<br>from using these technologies first if<br>this is to be used in any way shape or<br>form anywhere the fact of the matter is<br>that we all rely on shared ecosystems<br>you can't just opt out of it you can't<br>choose not to rely on the ecosystem<br>meaning that if there's a proposal to<br>alter it then that means doing that work<br>behind closed doors would deny you a<br>voice in decisions that would affect you<br>so this work above all else has to be<br>completely in the open from the outset<br>obviously if you're going to do<br>something as serious as deliberately<br>alter the shared environment on a large<br>scale it needs to offer very clear<br>benefits both to people and to the<br>natural world discussions should always<br>take place before experiments safeguards<br>have to be agreed upon very early on you<br>need independent monitoring and analysis<br>because who is the last person you want<br>to test the hypothesis anyone it's the<br>person who proposed it<br>that's the single most biased person in<br>the entire world<br>never mind that science normally works<br>exactly that way but technology<br>developer should not test their own<br>technology you need independent<br>assessment and above all else the<br>science needs to be not just open but<br>also responsive to the community because<br>wisdom is a collective virtue it's<br>something that we gain through<br>discussion with others now I've only<br>been at MIT for a year and a half so<br>we're still trying to figure out how<br>this is done and my sole real experience<br>with this is a project in which my group<br>is acting as the technical hands as it<br>were of the communities of Nantucket and<br>Martha's Vineyard off the coast of<br>Massachusetts and they're the problem is<br>tick-borne disease so the communities<br>are interested in altering the local<br>mouse population which is responsible<br>for infecting most ticks so that they<br>can either no longer be bitten by ticks<br>or can no longer transmit disease and<br>this would not involve any form of gene<br>Drive because they decided that since<br>they didn't meet it they're very small<br>islands that it would not but they chose<br>to alter the mice to actually kill the<br>ticks when they bite them in order to<br>cause the text to fall off and we've<br>been trying to figure out what is the<br>appropriate governance structure for<br>this not concerning ourselves with the<br>regulatory structures so much because<br>the United States we don't really have a<br>good regulatory structure for this sort<br>of thing so we found that it was best to<br>just go to the communities and say we<br>will do whatever you want this is your<br>project you tell us what you want you<br>tell us what you're concerned about we<br>will look at that and we will deal with<br>the regulator's when that comes and so<br>far that's worked out we'll see if that<br>keeps on going but in the in this time<br>we've really come up with two<br>philosophical rules when it comes to<br>engineering complex systems and in an<br>ecosystem is nothing if not complex rule<br>one is you make the smallest possible<br>change that you think has a chance of<br>solving the problem since you don't<br>understand the system there will be side<br>effects so you want to make the smallest<br>change<br>Rule two is you always start local see<br>what happens and only then consider<br>scaling up so why come here<br>well you have of course a problem of<br>with invasive species as does pretty<br>much everywhere but yours are especially<br>acute on the Left we have a black rat<br>consuming a nesting bird while it's<br>still alive and on the right you have a<br>brown rat eating a bird these are of<br>course species that the local ecosystem<br>would almost certainly be better without<br>at the same time these rats also have<br>nervous systems they also suffer when we<br>kill them so a lot of people are now<br>interested in this question of can we<br>use gene drive technology to help render<br>New Zealand predator free by removing<br>rats so how would that work first of all<br>and why are people interested so a gene<br>drive is first of all a naturally<br>occurring phenomenon 60% more or less of<br>our genomes are made up of broken gene<br>Drive remnants it's nearly impossible to<br>find a wild species that doesn't have at<br>least one active gene drive or the<br>remnants of one somewhere in its genome<br>it's nothing more nothing less than a<br>genetic element that can reliably<br>increase in a population even if it<br>doesn't help the organism reproduce<br>that's pretty much the definition but we<br>can only recently we've learned to<br>deliberately harness these using CRISPR<br>genome editing so here's how it works if<br>you have the genome of a rodent and you<br>want to edit it the way we do this<br>nowadays is we use CRISPR so if you're<br>introduced into the germline cells of<br>this rodent cells that will go on to<br>produce sperm or eggs DNA that encodes<br>the change you want to make in blue in<br>the middle there but if you also encode<br>the CRISPR nucleus gene that cuts the<br>DNA it's like a molecular scalpel and<br>the guide RNA telling it exactly where<br>it should cut if you encode all of those<br>together introduce them into the cell<br>then the cell will produce the crisper<br>components and they will cut the DNA at<br>exactly the target site and of all those<br>billions of bases we now have CRISPR<br>variants that cut with virtually no off<br>target cutting anywhere and it will if<br>it repairs using the correct pathway it<br>will insert the new DNA in its place<br>so now you've altered that version of<br>the gene but now you've just made a cell<br>that knows how to do genome editing on<br>its own so it's going to make the CRISPR<br>system and it's going to cut the other<br>chromosome because recall that we have<br>two copies of most genes because we have<br>two copies of every chromosome except<br>the sex chromosomes so now you have this<br>organism has two copies of the edited<br>version and the magic happens when it<br>mates with a wild organism all of the<br>offspring inherit one copy of the edited<br>version and in those offspring editing<br>happens again it cuts the wild-type<br>version and converts it to the edited<br>version meaning that when those<br>offspring made their own offspring are<br>guaranteed to inherit editing happens<br>again and again and again this is a<br>clever trick it's also a bit of a<br>terrifying trick you can imagine you<br>might say okay altering a population is<br>one thing how on earth could that solve<br>the rat problem<br>well you can do a lot of things if you<br>can control an organism's genome for<br>example you can make it male this<br>population is not long for this world<br>nothing all male has a very good chance<br>of surviving but you can do other things<br>too you can for example ensure that when<br>two carriers of the drive system mate<br>that the female offspring will be<br>infertile if you do that then the drive<br>system will spread very rapidly when<br>it's rare because you will very rarely<br>have two carriers meeting but once it's<br>very common then the females become<br>infertile in the population crashes so<br>these are two different ways that we<br>could suppress populations with gene<br>Drive systems both of them originally<br>really envisioned by Austin Burt and of<br>Imperial College one<br>it was only with the advent of CRISPR<br>that we could really conceive of doing<br>it in a species such as a rat so we<br>published his paper almost three or<br>three or so years back in which this was<br>figure seven potential uses of this kind<br>of gene drive system we call CRISPR and<br>RNA guided system because it uses RNA to<br>tell it where to cut and you can see<br>there's lots of potential things we<br>might do but of course the rat is<br>prominently featured so how many of you<br>think that this gene Drive system could<br>be a useful tool for conservation for<br>getting rid of rats how many of you<br>think it could do the job but I also<br>think that this figure was a terrible<br>mistake on my part what do we know about<br>rats<br>well spreading infertility in rats may<br>well be the smallest possible change<br>capable of solving this problem I mean<br>this sort of thing is species-specific<br>it only cuts a sequence unique to rats<br>wouldn't work in any other organism even<br>if it somehow got into some other<br>organism it just wouldn't work and wind<br>affect any other organism it's just the<br>rat population would all of a sudden<br>crash it should be humane you don't have<br>to kill any rats they just stop<br>reproducing until they're gone I will I<br>will give you that it abides by rule one<br>it's rule two that is the problem where<br>are there rats in the world everywhere<br>and unlike some other species one might<br>name they got there mostly on their own<br>I mean they stowed away on our ships but<br>we didn't deliberately bring them they<br>move on their own without really much<br>help for us so as highly invasive<br>stowaways we really have to worry about<br>accidental invasion that is right now<br>New Zealand is probably getting more<br>rats from incoming cargo ships and it's<br>probably exporting rats on those very<br>same cargo ships to other parts of the<br>world<br>and models suggests that there is a<br>chance it's a very small chance but it's<br>still a chance that one introduced<br>animal can start the spread of this gene<br>drive system through the local<br>population and with a dozen animals it's<br>virtually guaranteed so there's probably<br>enough rat gene flow that even if you<br>did this in New Zealand it would spread<br>elsewhere in the world you might say but<br>wait a minute this is a suppression<br>Drive it's going to locally eliminate<br>the rats before it can do that right<br>well models suggests that that's<br>probably going to take oh eight or so<br>years eight years of having gene Drive<br>rats present able to jump onto the ships<br>and the rat generation time is three<br>months so it's not going to eliminate<br>the local population on the cargo<br>freighter before it gets to its<br>destination either in other words it<br>probably would spread on its own but<br>let's assume that it didn't here's a<br>close to home example the rabbit<br>Khaleesi virus the cause of rabbit<br>hemorrhagic disease was illegally<br>smuggled into New Zealand from Australia<br>where it had been accidentally released<br>from the test island where is it where<br>it had been tested as a biological<br>control agent<br>that's because rabbits do quite a bit of<br>economic damage New Zealand a year may<br>be about a hundred million dollars a<br>year or there abouts just for comparison<br>brown rats do somewhere north of 20<br>billion dollars of damage every year in<br>the United States alone so to assume<br>that you could do something here to get<br>rid of your rat population and no one<br>would try to smuggle it out is uh just<br>not tenable so the upshot is I don't<br>think that form of gene drive is a good<br>tool for conservation and I bitterly<br>regret making that figure because I was<br>very foolish back then and thinking<br>about the technical limitations as<br>opposed to the broader social and<br>international implications because you<br>can imagine that would cause quite the<br>dispute it were one country to just<br>decide we're gonna solve our problem and<br>we don't care about everywhere else<br>because among other things<br>rats are native to eurasia you probably<br>play<br>sort of reasonably important ecological<br>role there and we don't really know what<br>it is no one's ever bothered because we<br>only think of them as invasives but they<br>are native to somewhere so if we don't<br>want to deal with that then we need some<br>way of confining the effects to the<br>invasive rat population only if we're<br>gonna look at any kind of genetic<br>technology of this sort so how can we do<br>that the problem is a standard CRISPR<br>gene Drive has everything it needs to<br>copy itself so let's split it up<br>let's move the components onto different<br>chromosomes we call this the daisy chain<br>drive because they're sort of causally<br>linked see causes B to be copied B<br>causes a to be copied but there's<br>nothing here that causes C to be copied<br>C is like a normal engineered gene and<br>the thing about engineered genes is that<br>when we alter an organism it doesn't<br>matter if it's selective breeding or<br>modern genome editing we're typically<br>reducing its ability to survive and<br>reproduce evolution is just better at<br>that than we are for the most part and<br>if we're say spreading infertility<br>through the population you're definitely<br>doing something that's costly to it but<br>if it were neutral then C would be more<br>or less neutral you'd introduce a number<br>of copies and they'd stay there but<br>while that's there it would increase B<br>and then while B is there it would<br>increase a even more now in reality<br>natural selection is going to act<br>against all of them and that's kind of<br>like gravity so my favorite metaphor for<br>this is it's a daisy Drive is kind of<br>like a multi-stage booster rocket where<br>each link in the chain is like adding a<br>booster stage that propels the thing you<br>actually want to spread whatever is in a<br>to higher and higher frequencies in the<br>population but it's ultimately limited<br>it runs out of fuel and it comes down so<br>that means that it's local and temporary<br>just inherently it has a limited amount<br>of genetic fuel in the form of Daisy<br>elements and when uses them up then it<br>stops the neat thing about it is just<br>like a booster rocket if you add on more<br>stages it gets more powerful<br>and in this case gravity doesn't work<br>quite the same way so it actually works<br>better and better as you add more<br>elements within some theoretical caveats<br>that's also not the only way you can<br>split up the components so we split it<br>up so you have a this b and a here you<br>can also imagine you just have lots of<br>copies of B all over the genome all of<br>them random they all while at least one<br>copy of B is around it copies a but<br>every generation you mate since there's<br>nothing copying B you lose half of your<br>copies so if you have four after one<br>generation you have two after generation<br>two then you have one generation three<br>and you're out and now a is on its own<br>so we call this a daisy field drive<br>because you're just scattering Daisy<br>elements throughout the genome and the<br>new leaders half every generation until<br>they're gone so there's different forms<br>of Daisy drive that we could use daisy<br>chain and daisy field and for<br>conservation you really don't want to<br>have to release too many rats into these<br>environmentally sensitive areas given<br>the depredations that they cause on your<br>native populations so you really want to<br>release won't have to release only a<br>handful and then let the drive system<br>replicate and a strong daisy chain or<br>daisy field can be amplified more than<br>500 fold in less than 20 generations if<br>it works very well we don't know if<br>there will yet I'll talk about that<br>later but if it works very well the<br>models suggest that this is possible now<br>what if the Daisy rats stowaway I mean<br>we know they're going to write well it<br>can't really invade the population it<br>has a limited amount of genetic fuel and<br>you're not introducing enough of them to<br>convert even lard pail or even a tiny<br>fraction of the population of say<br>Australia but any kind of gene flow is a<br>problem in a world where nations can<br>gain economic advantages by raising<br>trade barriers against your products in<br>fact it's very common as I think most of<br>you know if a nation has contamination<br>with GMO food of one type or another<br>than other nations use as an excuse to<br>raise trade barriers against their<br>products so in this case if you were to<br>use any form<br>of genetic control nothing then it's<br>entirely possible that any kind of<br>detected DNA in some other country off<br>of ships carrying New Zealand goods<br>could result in trade barriers and<br>people are gonna be concerned by that so<br>how do you rescue that well what you<br>need is a way to teach genes how to<br>recognize international borders right we<br>can totally do that right no seriously<br>how do you do that well the gene itself<br>is of course never gonna recognize<br>borders it doesn't have a nervous system<br>it doesn't have a brain but what it does<br>know in a weird sort of way is how many<br>versions of it there are in the<br>population relative to competing<br>versions of it in certain in certain<br>forms of genetics so what you need to do<br>is give the gene the franchise that is<br>you need to teach it to hold votes<br>figure out which gene is in the majority<br>engineered or wild-type and then have<br>natural selection favored whichever is<br>the winner whichever is already in the<br>majority so that's what we call this<br>Daisy quorum system and we thought of it<br>because in the United States these this<br>immunized mice to prevent tick-borne<br>disease trick if it works on the islands<br>then there's a lot of mainland<br>communities that are going to want it to<br>but their neighboring the neighboring<br>town might not want it so how do you let<br>one town alter its population and not<br>the neighboring town well with this<br>trick if you build we call it a Daisy<br>quorum once the Daisy drive runs out of<br>fuel then the quorum affects which is on<br>the genes in effect to vote they<br>determine which of them is in the<br>majority and if engineered is in the<br>majority then it goes to a hundred<br>percent if wild types in the majority<br>then then it goes to a hundred percent<br>meaning you release in one town it<br>spreads becomes the majority in that<br>town then runs out of Daisy elements the<br>quorum sends it to one hundred percent<br>in that town but it can't invade the<br>next town and is any any organisms that<br>cross the border<br>their genes will be selected against<br>because they're in the minority over<br>there so it lets one town stay<br>engineered in its neighboring town stay<br>wild-type<br>not necessarily perfect but natural<br>selection is at least now working to<br>enforce your arbitrary national borders<br>so we could include something like this<br>in a suppression Drive so that you would<br>never end up with a population hopefully<br>that enough to be even detectable coming<br>off of any kind of cargo freighter into<br>any other country so my hope is that the<br>ability to make these drive systems<br>local means that we could address all<br>the sorts of problems we had envisioned<br>earlier and possibly even more I mean<br>the fundamental problem from an animal<br>welfare perspective of much of the<br>natural world is that starvation and<br>death are an often horrible death are<br>very common but if you can control<br>reproduction to some extent then you can<br>prevent that kind of overpopulation and<br>suffering and crash so but I'm frankly<br>I'm nervous I don't know if this is a<br>good idea<br>ever I don't know if this is a good idea<br>for any specific application and I most<br>certainly don't know if this is a good<br>idea here in a hotel row because I don't<br>live here I don't have any kind of sense<br>of place I don't have any connection to<br>it I haven't even really studied the<br>ecological literature on the system you<br>have here so I don't know if it's a good<br>idea and that's why we're here today now<br>to be clear we haven't yet built a daisy<br>drive system in any rodent or even a<br>crisp standard CRISPR based gene drive<br>system we are planning experiments in<br>mice but we haven't done them yet and<br>rats would then follow that because you<br>always start in mice because they're<br>easy and the reason I'm here today is<br>because it's appropriate to approach a<br>community that might be interested in<br>eventually applying a technology before<br>you even begin the experiments in the<br>lab because the goal here is to say look<br>now you know that there's several<br>different forms of this is this<br>something that you might be interested<br>in at all<br>and if so<br>how should we go about it so is this<br>something that might be of use there are<br>many good reasons against it is again<br>mostly theoretical in general with<br>biotechnology it's very uncertain as to<br>whether or not we can get anything to<br>work usually the answer is no<br>historically however the introduction of<br>CRISPR has really changed this in<br>general if something involves CRISPR<br>then the answer is by default yes we can<br>get it to work it might take a long time<br>but usually if it involves Eveleigh on<br>CRISPR as this does then we can<br>eventually get it to work but no<br>promises we haven't done it yet we<br>really don't know how best to test the<br>spread and stability of these elements<br>in the laboratory we're working on it in<br>worms just because we can grow a ton of<br>them but we don't know if that's the<br>best way still has to figure that out<br>it's really hard to predict outcomes<br>anytime you're doing any kind of<br>ecological change you should know that<br>more better than anyone and of course<br>there's the international complications<br>involved in any form of genetic bio<br>control I am sure that some people here<br>are at least leery of all forms of<br>genetic engineering for a variety of<br>different reasons and of course this may<br>conflict with some forms of Maori values<br>or otherwise just be unsuitable for<br>other reasons in favor it's humane no<br>poisons required no animal suffering on<br>anywhere it's local it's very species<br>specific again even if you know even if<br>a rat eat even if a rat is eaten by a<br>hawk or a cat or something even if the<br>DNA was taken up somehow across the<br>cross the gut barrier epithelial barrier<br>and got into the gut into say the cats<br>cells then it still wouldn't get into<br>the cat's germline cells the one that<br>makes sperm and eggs even if it did even<br>if it were incorporated it shouldn't<br>have any sites that it could cut because<br>it's programmed to cut rat sequences not<br>those of any other organism and CRISPR<br>is extremely specific so it really<br>should be very narrowly species-specific<br>unlike a lot of the original genetic<br>engineering experiments that led to so<br>much mistrusts this would be entirely<br>open in community guided research<br>community in the driver's seat<br>scientists just as the technical hands<br>saying this is possible this is possible<br>which do you want or neither<br>you're already committed on one level<br>and other to removing invasive rodents<br>so this question of site ecological side<br>effects is well at least to some extent<br>mood and in this case if you're<br>uncomfortable with the idea of<br>introducing engineered genes if it works<br>and you do succeed in removing all the<br>rats then you would remove all the<br>engineered genes with them it would be a<br>one-time temporary thing and then<br>they're gone if it works if it doesn't<br>work you might have engineered rat<br>alleles hanging around for some time<br>lastly agreeing to participate in<br>guiding development doesn't necessarily<br>mean you agreed to do anything about it<br>I mean the towns of Nantucket and<br>Martha's Vineyard are now directing this<br>project to immunize their mice and that<br>will involve releasing up to a hundred<br>thousand genetically engineered mice<br>onto each Island and yet there seem to<br>be dramatically in favor of it which you<br>would not expect because a lot of the<br>people there who are very strongly in<br>favor and speak up in favor of the<br>project don't eat GMO foods some of them<br>don't even vaccinate their children and<br>yet there and yet people who meet those<br>characteristics have asked us so once<br>you make the mice can we breed them up<br>on our property and release them first<br>here so it doesn't necessarily correlate<br>and but above all most people say yeah<br>go ahead develop in the lab yeah go<br>ahead and test them on some other Island<br>first that's fine we can always say no<br>later and that's also true here if you<br>are interested then which approach in<br>which version note that you can build a<br>daisy Drive system that will directly<br>suppress rodents biceps a spreading<br>female infertility that's fast its<br>people may not be as reliable as option<br>two which is alter the look population<br>probably using that quorum trick and<br>then remove them but that would take<br>longer different costs and benefits then<br>there's the questions of safety how much<br>do you really need to know what do we<br>need to test in the lab how rigorously<br>in terms of stability these are going to<br>evolve we have little if any experience<br>engineering things putting them out<br>there and expecting them to evolve<br>that's just not true of any of our crops<br>we control their genetics this would<br>evolve on its own where we'd field<br>trials be held you have lots of islands<br>with invasive rodents which one of them<br>and is that site suitable for answering<br>the relevant ecological questions that<br>would be needed to know if you should<br>apply it elsewhere<br>what about governance I mean again our<br>mice against ticks this is a much<br>smaller community New Zealand is roughly<br>a hundred times larger in population and<br>land area so there we could just say<br>this is New England Town Hall democracy<br>we're having lots of town hall meetings<br>and we're doing whatever the citizens<br>largely say that we should do that's not<br>necessarily going to work here so how<br>should Daisy Drive research be guided<br>the one thing that I will say is if you<br>are interested then however it is done<br>then joint governance by Mori would be<br>absolutely vital and I say that because<br>as the sort of person who does a lot of<br>reductionist science gets really hard<br>when you start talking connected<br>ecosystem lots of moving parts and more<br>in a more holistic viewpoint I think is<br>is a necessary corrective to some of our<br>built-in tendencies to simplify and<br>assume that this will not be a factor<br>because then our models work and reality<br>is messy and more complicated so I think<br>we will definitely need additional<br>perspectives more broadly if you're<br>going to do anything like this<br>Daisy Drive whatever you do I would urge<br>you to ensure that<br>the science is open because again we<br>need to set a precedent that when a new<br>technology would affect everybody<br>it must be developed in the open and it<br>should actively invite concerns and<br>criticism from everyone because science<br>works by inviting others to prove us<br>wrong and as someone who develops<br>technologies I would far rather be<br>publicly humiliated then help lead an<br>effort that turns out to go terrifically<br>awry after release so please tell me<br>just how wrong I am and why please<br>please please please do and that should<br>go for any other scientists to arrange<br>for independent assessment you can't<br>trust me to tell you because I am biased<br>I'm involved in this technology you<br>would need somebody else to assess it<br>and same goes for anything else you plan<br>and please start local and scale up a<br>full-blown version is probably just too<br>invasive and on some level I'm morally<br>responsible for that one too even if you<br>do it thanks so much for to kneel for<br>the invitation and danav Landcare<br>research for for helping to put this<br>together and many many people in terms<br>of collaborators and I'm not going to go<br>through the members of my group the MIT<br>Media Lab to the extent that I'm saying<br>anything that is not typical for a<br>scientist that's because my incentives<br>are totally different from other<br>scientists I'm at the MIT Media Lab<br>which is a more anti disciplinary<br>atmosphere that encourages us to<br>challenge current assumptions so if<br>there are real heroes in this story it<br>is not me I'm just following my<br>incentives like everybody else it's my<br>students that are taking the risk by<br>pledging to make all of their work open<br>where it can be stolen by other<br>scientists who don't play by the same<br>rules<br>so they're the ones really taking the<br>risk of the heroes of the story and<br>finally now is the time for questions<br>suggestions concerns criticism I've<br>written up a lot of this information and<br>it's on our our website responsive<br>science which is designed for to<br>facilitate community discussion it's<br>very it's very new it's due for an<br>update that was supposed to be due today<br>but<br>things happen it's it will should be<br>next week or so but you can still go<br>there and read it most of the<br>information is available and links to<br>other useful materials so please tell me<br>what do you think well thank you very<br>much Kevin<br>let's lift quite a high level of time<br>for questions which I think we'll<br>probably arise after quite a provocative<br>presentation so I if we're recording<br>this so if you have a question I'll<br>bring the microphone to you somebody has<br>to keep the questions off just a comment<br>on one of your opening statements about<br>scientists need to take consequences of<br>all the effects of their technology and<br>we've got a very sad case at the moment<br>of a woman who was burnt and then died<br>of an insulin overdose and I just made<br>the comment that that can be very much<br>interpreted and if you don't mind<br>oversimplified in there you're not going<br>to you know the scientists who<br>discovered insulin and sure someone who<br>can tell me who that is I think it was a<br>Canadian but you know can't be held<br>responsible for how that was used so I<br>think I think we need to be careful<br>about just saying we've got to be<br>responsible for all as scientists you<br>have to be responsible for all of the<br>consequences because in different hands<br>yeah science can be good or bad I mean<br>whoever the human was and who who<br>controlled fire and used fire you know<br>can't be helped responsible for<br>Greenfeld Tower and so so I think you<br>know we need to put that in context and<br>I'm worried that it'd be misinterpreted<br>I<br>one of the problems we have in New<br>Zealand in terms of the whole issue of<br>genetic modification is you know a very<br>vocal opposition to genetic modification<br>so I totally agree that science needs to<br>be open and we need to be telling people<br>but I'm concerned that if you say it's<br>community guided that actually you end<br>up not getting to the point where<br>actually can make an informed decision<br>and so you know what you do in the lab<br>and the things that you're doing there<br>yes very useful to be open but I'm<br>really concerned I'd be concerned to say<br>you know community tell us what you want<br>to do you know tell us in if in ten<br>years time you want an iPhone or even I<br>in fact I'm from tomorrow even the you<br>know we've been held to rent some I<br>would say for 30 years by wonderful old<br>lady who unfortunately died a couple of<br>weeks ago in terms of fluoride and we<br>haven't had fluoride in our talent for<br>for 30 years and that was guided by the<br>community<br>and now it's sort of become entrenched<br>so I'm really how would you see that<br>guidance mechanism working and and what<br>do you see as the put force I mean I've<br>already mentioned some of them so first<br>let me freely admit that I cherry-pick<br>my cases you know ones that are most<br>likely to work and the my second tics<br>project is one of those about again with<br>this address problems that are obvious<br>to everyone that people really do care<br>about fluoride is one of those hard ones<br>where the benefits are accrue over a<br>very long period of time and are by no<br>means obvious to everyone so that's the<br>case where a community is more than<br>likely to end up going against the<br>scientific consensus and potentially<br>missing out on benefits whereas if it's<br>something that is obvious like take born<br>disease then people are more likely to<br>try something new and different and be<br>willing to take chances if it's<br>something that they deeply care about on<br>them on the responsibility thing I agree<br>note that I said scientists should hold<br>themselves morally responsible<br>I'm from the US I can't say legally I<br>can't even just say responsible people<br>assume legally and then I'm opening<br>myself up to being sued that's what it<br>means to be American but I think we are<br>better off if we do hold ourselves<br>morally responsible for everything<br>because then that means if I'm thinking<br>of developing a new technology I have to<br>be extraordinarily concerned about how<br>it might be misused in every possible<br>way and I should do that before I tell<br>anyone about it at all because what<br>concerns me with Jean Drive is that five<br>years ago no one even imagined that we<br>would have the power to potentially<br>engineer an entire species even if we<br>can't do then whole species we can still<br>genetically affect the bulk of a species<br>and that's something that no one saw<br>coming it's not anywhere in science<br>fiction and yet now we're considering in<br>the case of malarial mosquitoes at least<br>actually doing it and we sort of saw<br>that coming in our paper we we published<br>that before we did any experiments in<br>the lab at all testing it which we got a<br>bit of flack for but we felt it was<br>important to set up this precedent of<br>you need to tell people so they can<br>identify anything glaringly wrong before<br>you actually develop it just in case<br>and we only even published it after we<br>thought about the ways it might be<br>misused and we concluded that since it's<br>slow unfailingly detectable if you<br>bother look for it with sequencing and<br>can be countered since anything that<br>anyone planed and replace that you do on<br>a Google Docs if you have 50<br>collaborators and they decide they want<br>to find and replace it back they're<br>gonna win that's how it is with gene<br>Drive anything that's slow anything<br>that's slow obvious and readily<br>countered isn't much of a weapon so we<br>were willing to publish it but if it had<br>been otherwise then we would have been<br>back to probably not something that we<br>tell everybody about and I'm just<br>concerned that if we don't go into it<br>holding ourselves morally responsible<br>for the consequences then we are more<br>likely to blunder into something that is<br>truly dangerous because this time we got<br>lucky in many ways who knows what the<br>next technology is so I would rather<br>that we be safe I don't have a good<br>answer for the community guidance issues<br>I think that in general fluoride is the<br>hardest possible case on the other side<br>just as the tick-borne disease is one of<br>the easiest and malaria are some of the<br>easiest possible cases so I'm willing to<br>say community guidance here because I am<br>interested in hearing from perspectives<br>that we might not otherwise hear from<br>that might differ from my own and expand<br>our perspective it's all very well for<br>the for the scientists to start doing<br>something but then you know they'll<br>become sort of enamored with their own<br>cleverness and they'll give us like he<br>said at the beginning there is person to<br>test our hypothesis as though as a<br>proposal so it's so business development<br>of mistrust that that the the scientists<br>who are working on this are not going to<br>be open or are going to just become<br>enthusiasts for their own for their own<br>work and so so the the answer to that<br>from an anti GM point of view was don't<br>even start and that's a sort of<br>conversation we're having in New Zealand<br>CRISPR has changed that quite a lot I<br>must say but I think it's still a big<br>kyouda I'm Philippa Jamison Irish of<br>organic in Zed magazine thank you very<br>much for your talk and I completely<br>agree that it has to be open in<br>responsive science I think that the to<br>date the opposition to GM his in a large<br>part came about because of the profit<br>driven industry driven corporate funded<br>science that has often hidden a lot of<br>information in and his his motives that<br>are not necessarily in the best<br>interests of society as a whole<br>shall we say so thank you I do<br>appreciate your open and responsive<br>science just a quick question about the<br>quixote rat which is a well you could<br>say native person did arrive here<br>posthuman with human settlement<br>it's got significance cultural<br>significance for Maori so I just<br>wondered if you had have any response<br>it is a separate species as far as I<br>know from haven't looked into it there<br>is no gene flow between it and either<br>the black or brown rats so the black and<br>brown rats could be specifically removed<br>without affecting excellence in terms of<br>whether it should be removed that is<br>very much not my decision so I think<br>that's just a discussion that that the<br>people of ayothaya are going to have to<br>decide for themselves and maybe the<br>answer is remove it from some places and<br>not from others and split the difference<br>in general I'm I'm in favor of trying<br>several different approaches just so you<br>can hedge your bets and see and see what<br>works so but in I'm sure it would not be<br>the priority I mean the priority is the<br>black rat but the black rat is harder to<br>engineer so we would start with the<br>brown rat just because it is a more of<br>them<br>organism and then moved to the black rat<br>from there were we to pursue this and<br>just to be fair because the rat is such<br>an incredibly invasive organism just<br>about everywhere other where it's not<br>native and there is interest in doing<br>this there's actually interest just from<br>the communities around around Boston and<br>in fact from Nantucket<br>the Connecticut Conservation Society is<br>very interested in oh you're doing that<br>too can you remove rats from our island<br>that would be great so we probably will<br>develop the technology but we won't but<br>we would never apply it in New Zealand<br>if you didn't want it I mean so when I<br>say you say no when we walk away that is<br>totally true that has to be true the<br>community has the last word about your<br>environment but with the case of this<br>technology frankly even if even if I<br>walked away and didn't do it at all<br>somebody would likely do it and that's<br>why I think we have to be so careful<br>with technology in general because once<br>it's out there once it's published once<br>it's obvious if it's useful to someone<br>humanity will pursue it someone will<br>pursue it and that's why we have to be<br>so careful about what we what we<br>discover and how we present it in the<br>first place so the star you talked about<br>how we couldn't just chuck it in the<br>island and and do it because it could<br>spread around and issues around that but<br>when we look at New Zealand we have been<br>really good at actually being able to<br>chuck things on an island and fix it and<br>keep it contained and when we had two<br>black robins which went down to around<br>10 I believe population we managed to<br>get an island completely pest free to<br>stop any gene flow of rats and<br>completely Clara and puppies Robin's on<br>this island New Zealand I believe in<br>like a Chatham with something and we got<br>a population to like 100 surely we<br>couldn't just trial out here in one of<br>them islands like the same effort we've<br>already proven we can do that like<br>that's one of the hard ones because I<br>fully believe that you could likely do<br>it on some small<br>now I don't see how you could maintain<br>biocontrol against in particular<br>determined human opposition if people<br>want to move it and they're determined<br>and especially if they have resources<br>and I think they will<br>I mean I'm concerned that people will<br>move it and just to potentially cause<br>trouble or to make a political point or<br>whatever and when you add economics<br>behind it it tends to become a near<br>certainty so even if you could do it<br>safely even if you could you know block<br>search the cargo freighters or doused<br>them with 1080 or whatever to ensure<br>that you it never stowed away and escape<br>naturally some human would deliberately<br>move it just because billions of dollars<br>a year in economic damage means someone<br>would want to do it somewhere do we have<br>any other questions Kiera I'm Claire<br>Bleakley I'm one of those genetic<br>engineers that is highly concerned over<br>genetic engineering that dr. Ralston<br>mentioned what I am concerned about is<br>in 15 years ago that spoke the speech<br>you gave was not given to the public but<br>the very concept that it wouldn't be<br>able to escape that it would feed the<br>world that pesticides would go down that<br>this that and the other<br>we now have contamination we have cross<br>species within with you know like<br>Sherlock taking out the genetic gene we<br>have canola spreading everywhere and<br>able to be controlled within moved to<br>one of the slides you mentioned about<br>khaleesi virus and the fact that summary<br>released it in an inappropriate way<br>which meant that the pregnant<br>rabbit her progeny was actually<br>able to survive khaleesi virus because<br>of the immunities that went through my<br>concern with what you're talking about<br>is what the National Academy of Sciences<br>has brought up and I think you've really<br>touched very lightly on that about the<br>inability to really know how it's going<br>to affect the ecosystems the fact that<br>CRISPR doesn't know any biological<br>boundaries or political boundaries and<br>you mentioned that as well so I would<br>say that I I believe you have a good<br>hypothesis but it needs at least a<br>generation for you to find out exactly<br>how it's going to work even before you<br>go up into your laboratory studies<br>because one of the things about Sciences<br>is what they found I think in this paper<br>it may have been another crisper paper<br>was that with the mosquitoes it was fine<br>in a laboratory situation but actually<br>once it was released into a larger<br>situation the females actually shunned<br>the genetically modified males and<br>actually had I think it was called<br>immune resistance they actually by for<br>generations those genes that were<br>carrying the thing had actually been<br>wiped out so in the fourth generation<br>there were mosquitoes that had totally<br>re-engineered their genes to actually<br>have got rid of that how have you worked<br>on that kind of issue of the immediate<br>the the wild population breeding into<br>scintillation and so the selection that<br>you can guarantee in a country this size<br>great point so that's what I like to<br>think of as a evolution does what it can<br>always and if you try to fight evolution<br>head-on you usually lose so you don't do<br>that you try to you try to redirect it<br>you try to harness if you try to you try<br>to move it<br>in some other direction but you never<br>fight it head-on because you have to<br>assume that it will try to do that it is<br>worth noting that in terms of<br>interspecies barriers well please raise<br>your hand if you ate beef in the last<br>week or so does anyone eaten beef from<br>last week or so you know that the cow<br>genome is 25% snake because a couple<br>million years ago a virus moved a<br>natural gene drive system from snakes<br>into the ORAC and it replicated until it<br>was 1/4 of the cow genome so not only to<br>do horizontal movements we have to<br>assume they'll happen because it happens<br>in nature to begin with but that does<br>show us that the The Tree of Life isn't<br>really so much of a tree it's where the<br>branches have become separate they<br>actually do all inter wink and connect<br>together so on one level means perhaps<br>at least depends on your framework and<br>value system when perhaps shouldn't be<br>so concerned with is that this species<br>or that species because we're all one<br>connected web of life on the other hand<br>it means that we need to be cautious<br>about the potential effects so you asked<br>what are what are we doing what are our<br>best ideas so again my lab is called the<br>sculpting evolution group and that's<br>because we are particularly concerned<br>with what happens when we engineer<br>something and then it can evolve how can<br>evolution break the things that we build<br>so the biggest question with Daisy Drive<br>is is it in fact limited will it<br>actually stop the way it's predicted to<br>stop or can it find some way around this<br>CRISPR we actually don't see in any<br>animals or plants to date unless we have<br>put it there which is a little bit odd<br>because it's an incredibly useful system<br>and so you would think that if it could<br>move readily and be useful in a gene<br>Drive type context than it would because<br>it's incredibly common in microbes so<br>there are CRISPR systems in our in each<br>of our guts<br>40% of all bacteria have them 90% of<br>archaea have them so it's a little bit<br>odd if it were that<br>useful you know in the context of an<br>animal or a plant if it had never gotten<br>there but always we're concerned with<br>this numbers game in evolution so<br>there's a lot of rats here in New<br>Zealand any they call it just gave an<br>estimate of how many hundred million<br>maybe something like that it's assumed<br>100 million so the problem is evolution<br>is a numbers game you get a certain<br>number of lottery tickets and some of<br>those lottery tickets have the right<br>combination of mutations to do something<br>unexpected and there's no way to know<br>what it's going to do until you actually<br>play the game the problem is you can't<br>play the game on that scale in the<br>laboratory because no one is going to<br>fund my lab to raise a hundred million<br>rats so how can we possibly do that well<br>our best guess is we need to switch to<br>some other kind of organism where we can<br>raise 100 million in laboratory so we<br>work with nematode worms because the<br>other parameter in this is number of<br>generations because every generation<br>gets another shot at the lottery so you<br>need a hundred million organisms for<br>many generations we work with worms<br>because we can grow actually a billion<br>of them in the laboratory so 10 times<br>more in their generation time is three<br>days so we can run a hundred generations<br>in a year and the idea then is if you<br>did it in this context where you have a<br>population of initial worms of a billion<br>of them in each flask and you have all<br>these populations side by side you<br>introduce your Daisy Drive worms into<br>the first population if it works well<br>you expect it and then you and then you<br>do a dilution every generation of each<br>population with the next one if it works<br>the way you expect then it should run<br>out of elements and should fail to<br>convert the final population but if any<br>of those worms does something that<br>causes it to keep moving that allows it<br>to somehow keep sustaining itself then<br>it should take over the whole thing and<br>we should see it so this is the test<br>that we're going to perform<br>and it would be performed for any<br>proposed Daisy drive system in any<br>organism that is the worms are easy to<br>engineer so we can actually engineer<br>their genome to perfectly match the rat<br>genome sequences that would be targeted<br>in this case and we can program them so<br>that they are exactly as good at copying<br>DNA as the rat is which we haven't<br>measured yet by the way so I can't tell<br>you what it is but we had to have to<br>measure it and then program the worm to<br>match it and then the worm is our best<br>case laboratory because we can run more<br>organisms and four more generations than<br>would actually be true in the wild and<br>in the worm case we can also even mimic<br>different population structures in the<br>laboratory by growing worms in these<br>different wells and having a robot move<br>worms between wells in order to match<br>the gene flow patterns between different<br>populations of rats as measured here I<br>freely admit the limit here is ecologist<br>need to get to work and actually measure<br>and figure out what the gene flow<br>patterns in the rats are you'll probably<br>have a better knowledge of that here<br>than just about anywhere else but even<br>more would be good because we would need<br>to know what to do so we could then have<br>populations of worms that match those of<br>the rats and the gene flow and then we<br>should be able to introduce the Daisy<br>drive systems and observe the effects on<br>this mimicked population of rats is it<br>the real thing well no but no one gave<br>me the computational architecture to<br>simulate the whole world otherwise I'd<br>love to I've got a question so one of<br>the things about the gene drive<br>technology is that it is strongly well<br>effectively it's required sexual<br>reproduction in order for it to work so<br>isn't this going to be a selective<br>fourth force for asexual reproduction<br>and perhaps parthenogenesis and some<br>systems perhaps and your worms yeah so<br>that's a great point this only works and<br>organisms that exclusively reproduce<br>sexually if any organism can reproduce<br>asexually and you put any kind of<br>pressure on it using a gene drive it<br>will just switch to doing only that so<br>people were commenting on the Scottish<br>course out there<br>reproduces vegetatively you could never<br>use any form of gene drive on that it's<br>just not it just would never work there<br>have been some models that suggest that<br>inbreeding is a tremendous problem any<br>species that can switch to primarily<br>inbreeding would be an issue and that<br>makes it harder for the drive system<br>whether it makes it impossible is well<br>we need to do a lot more modeling of<br>that it's still the earliest possible<br>days we just don't know yet we have to<br>do more mathematical modeling we need to<br>run more experiments in the laboratory<br>and organisms that we can control and in<br>order to find these things out but the<br>question is what do we need to look at<br>are you worried about the stability are<br>you worried about the ecological effects<br>of removing rats that's that's what we<br>need to find out because if there is one<br>thing that we would not otherwise look<br>at that is suggested at one of these<br>meetings that leads us to look at it and<br>could that would otherwise cause a<br>problem then it it is absolutely worth<br>it for all of us to spend our time here<br>- over at that kind of problem in fact<br>just at our last meeting on Nantucket<br>someone asked the question that we had<br>not thought of I mean I looked at the<br>ecologist next to me and I said did you<br>think of that no that's a really good<br>point<br>we need to we need to model that so it<br>absolutely can happen and that's just<br>the technical concerns of course there's<br>also the values-based concerns and those<br>thanks very much a lot of conversation<br>about rates<br>I mean is it a different thing<br>conceptually to look at removal of mice<br>from some sites in the reason I asked<br>that is that New Zealand is currently<br>investigating the eradication of my soft<br>Oakland Islands isolated remote does it<br>offer opportunities absolutely so the<br>mouse frankly will be available first in<br>that mice or the model organism we try<br>that's the first organism my labs gonna<br>be developing Daisy drive systems in and<br>yeah for sure so any suggestions for<br>mice as well would be very much<br>appreciated this is about rodents across<br>the board or specifically mice brown<br>rats and black rats again leaving off<br>the excellence any other questions<br>what drawer to a closing quickly before<br>I thank Kevin can I get a show of hands<br>who thinks it's a good idea this gene<br>drive to eradicate rodents in New<br>Zealand gene driver it is daisy chains<br>what genetic technologies to eradicate<br>rodents what's that about fifty percent<br>assuming that those that haven't put up<br>their hands are against this idea it's<br>not enough information yet sitting on<br>the fence okay<br>No thank you that's that's very useful<br>because I think one thing that we need<br>to have in this country is a broader<br>discussion about the opportunities<br>around this and you know I think that<br>needs to be informed by a variety of<br>voices representing all the different<br>cultural and social groups with the New<br>Zealand can't just be scientists as<br>Kevin says we're with the we're the<br>worst people to to have that<br>conversation with and at one regard<br>because
