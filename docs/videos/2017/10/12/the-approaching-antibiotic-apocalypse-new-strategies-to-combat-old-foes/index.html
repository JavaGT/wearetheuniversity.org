A post-antibiotic era where some common infections can kill is a very real possibility for the 21st century. We will discuss the problem of antimicrobial resistance with particular reference to gram negative bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We will then discuss two new and potent concepts for antibiotic development, being investigated in the Otago Bacterial Energetics and Antimicrobial Resistance (OBEAR) group: 1) bacterial metabolism is an entirely new antibiotic target space that can circumvent resistance; 2) enzyme activators can be just as potent antimicrobials as enzyme inhibitors. <br><br>Dr James Usser is from the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Otago and Southern Community Laboratories. http://bit.ly/2yvoGpQ<br><br>Dr Kiel Hards is from the Otago Bacterial Energetics and Antimicrobial Resistance group, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Otago. http://bit.ly/2yvzHYk</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>kyouda koto and welcome to the final<br>medical forum hot topic for 2017 so once<br>per quarter we've been running these hot<br>hot topics on particular medical areas<br>of interest and today's topic is on<br>antimicrobial resistance which I'm sure<br>you'll agree is an incredibly important<br>challenge coming up for us over the next<br>few years and so I'm delighted to<br>introduce today dr. James Ussher<br>and Kyle hads from department of micro<br>and immuno knology and james you're from<br>micro as well and southern community<br>labs so thank you very much for coming<br>and speaking us today so we're going to<br>have James talking first followed by<br>Kyle about their view on the upcoming<br>antimicrobial resistance challenge thank<br>you very much thanks Julia so it's a<br>talk of two halves I'm going to start<br>off telling you what the problem is and<br>then Kyle's going to tell you what the<br>solution is or at least part of the<br>solution so let's see if this works<br>so I'm sure that it takes no convincing<br>everyone in this room that antibiotics<br>really have transformed modern medicine<br>so here here's an example of a couple of<br>papers separated by over almost 70 years<br>the first one published really at the<br>dawn of the antibiotic era looking at<br>the rates of the clinical outcome of<br>patients with staph aureus bacteremia<br>and then a similar paper from Australia<br>in New Zealand from 2009 and what you<br>can what you can see is the mortality<br>rate is was extremely high prior to the<br>antibiotic era<br>and that it brought his drop while it's<br>still high and the antibiotic area has<br>dropped markedly and also what I haven't<br>shown here is also the people who are<br>getting set for his bacteremia have<br>really has really changed it used to be<br>people who were young and healthy in<br>their teens and twenties who are getting<br>staph aureus bacteremia now it's people<br>when they're in the old age<br>unfortunately we're seeing the rise of<br>engine microbial resistance a 21st<br>century nightmare so here this is New<br>Zealand data from the air sir look at<br>the rates of mosa which have been<br>climbing currently in Dunedin Otago<br>we're running at around nine percent of<br>our staff aureus EMRs a and we know that<br>if you get a bacteremia with mosa your<br>mortality rate has doubled compared to<br>if you have it with methicillin<br>susceptible staph aureus bacteria or<br>perhaps more concern is the emergence of<br>multi drug-resistant gram-negative such<br>as intro bacteria which because the<br>family that includes a coli Klebsiella<br>pneumoniae that produce extended<br>spectrum beta lactamase Azure ESP Elves<br>which I'm sure many of you are familiar<br>with and we've really seen an<br>exponential increase and the in the<br>rates of these over the last decade and<br>continues to climb exponentially and in<br>the southern region and we know that if<br>you get a bacteremia with this you're<br>you almost got a double rate risk of<br>mortality than if you have a vector emia<br>with a susceptible strain and faerie<br>directory ACR so currently in Otago<br>Southland we're running at approximately<br>two percent rate of our e-coli are<br>resistant to extended spectrum roulette<br>hands but in other parts of the world<br>the rates are much higher so here's some<br>data from you can get off this excellent<br>website where you can make these maps<br>looking at rates of resistance in<br>different parts of the world we can see<br>there in India this is a little lag on<br>in India the rates of resistance SDL's<br>an e.coli are well over in excess of 80<br>percent including in other parts of<br>Southeast Asia where we have data for so<br>we're a relatively privileged situation<br>at the moment but we said<br>by a sea of resistance it's not only<br>resistance to extend its picture I<br>expect from beta lactams it's of concern<br>probably what's the greatest concern is<br>resistance to carbapenems are our golden<br>bullet antibiotic that we can up until<br>recently been allowed to use to treat<br>pretty much anything but if we look at<br>the rates of resistance influencial and<br>ammonia in the indian subcontinent the<br>rates of resistance to carbapenems are<br>exceeding 60 percent of cook scale and<br>ammonia ISIL it's producing a carbon pin<br>amaze and infections for these have an<br>extremely high mortality rate associated<br>so 50% of people have died from the<br>fictions with these with these we'll<br>learn about a month and your risk of<br>dying so over threefold higher if you<br>get an infection with a carbapenem a is<br>producing Klebsiella pneumoniae than if<br>you get one with a susceptible strain to<br>date we haven't seen much of this in New<br>Zealand we've only seen two cases and<br>Otago and Southland and both have been<br>one there was a urinary tract infection<br>the other was carriage that we picked up<br>but we're increasingly seeing these so<br>you can see the start of the epidemic<br>curve taking off as it has for ESP else<br>as well and to date this year there's<br>been a 35 isolate so to the end of<br>September that have been isolated across<br>the country and consuming Li not all of<br>these are associated with overseas<br>travel some patients there's been no<br>clear association with travel suggesting<br>that there may be some unknown<br>transmission in the community so we've<br>done some worker with John Crump and<br>turn on my air from Yangon who tends<br>doing a God's doing a PhD at the moment<br>with with John Crump looking at rates of<br>gram-negative resistance and Myanmar so<br>this is a retrospective study that we<br>recently published we looked at all the<br>gram-negative isolates from black<br>culture isolates from three hospitals<br>over six month period including their<br>large teaching hospital Yangon general I<br>think the first thing you notice is not<br>is that they're not necessarily<br>culturing as much as you might get here<br>we've had more gram-negative isalus less<br>and a much smaller Hospital but if we<br>look at those the usual range of<br>suspects<br>Iko likely be on your mone also a bit of<br>Salmonella typhi and para typing which<br>we don't really see very often here but<br>very high rates of the SPL production so<br>38% of the isolates the SPL producers<br>are half the e.coli is almost half of<br>Clemson and ammonia eyes and high rate<br>of carbapenem A's producers as well in<br>concerning me if you just look at the<br>isolates from the public hospital from<br>Yangon general 73% of the coal eyes and<br>100% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae eyes<br>either produced in the SPL or a<br>carbapenem eyes and it was if you don't<br>have a empiric treatment regimen that<br>includes colistin it's not possible to<br>cover more than 80% of the isolate of<br>the gram-negative isolates so this is<br>already a reality for practice of<br>medicine and some parts of the world so<br>what's the the big issue with these<br>these are multi drug-resistant they're<br>approaching pan drug resistance and this<br>is from the original paper the energy<br>diagram for the original paper<br>describing the new delhi metallo beta<br>lactamase it was published in The Lancet<br>Infectious Diseases back in 2010 and<br>these isolates as you can see I've<br>highlighted and read down the bottom the<br>only two antibiotics that really remains<br>the SIF remain effective ticka cycling<br>was effective in two-thirds and colistin<br>was effective and almost all of them<br>barring a few intrinsically resistant<br>isolates but these are toxic antibiotics<br>pegasi cleaners got a it's got a warning<br>with it and that the mortality rate has<br>higher than those who received it than<br>those who don't<br>and colistin there's a toxic is an old<br>drug but a very toxic dragon one which<br>we've avoided for for many years<br>unfortunately the mobile whole plasma<br>mediation colistin resistance was<br>recently described this gene MCO one was<br>described in Lancet Infectious Diseases<br>last year by a group in China<br>and they looked at they found this and<br>the animals a bit high rates and pigs<br>with almost 25 percent or roughly 20% of<br>the isolates of things that slaughter<br>contained this gene they had isolates<br>that contain this gene they could also<br>detect it in food meat in the<br>supermarkets and then they could also<br>detect it in a small number of patients<br>as well suggesting that the genie was<br>already out of the bottle for resistance<br>to colistin and part of the reason is<br>that Collison's been a widely used in<br>agricultural practice and has been used<br>as a growth promoter and pigs and in<br>China despite this being a last line<br>antibiotic since then in cr1 the mobile<br>collison gene has been reported from<br>multiple countries around the world both<br>in humans and and animals suggesting<br>that it's already widely disseminated<br>and wasn't a problem that's limited to<br>China and then concerning Lee it has<br>also been reported in conjunction with<br>carbapenem A's production leading to a<br>truly pain resistant infections from not<br>only China but also other countries<br>around the world as well so a report<br>recently from the United States as well<br>so this has lead to headlines in the<br>popular media so this one was from from<br>the weekend at the top antibiotic<br>apocalypse dr. sound alarm / drug<br>resistance and this was around the Cole<br>reporting of resistance to colistin with<br>jalapeno maize production so these<br>headlines sort of periodically appearing<br>in the in the news 2014 the w-h-o put<br>out a report trying to sort of sum up<br>where antimicrobial resistance is at and<br>to quote them they say the problem so<br>serious that are threatens the<br>achievements of modern medicine a<br>post-antibiotic era in which common<br>infections and minor injuries can kill<br>is a very real possibility for the 21st<br>century well I certainly think that this<br>could have a huge impact on our practice<br>of medicine if you can sort of patients<br>who you know suppress for transplants<br>for kids Kim therapy having surgery<br>having elective procedures with hip<br>joints and etc being put in if you get<br>an infection with one of these organisms<br>that's a disaster<br>recently the UK government commissioned<br>a report to try and lead by economist<br>Jim O'Neill who was I think with Goldman<br>Sachs and looking at what the cost event<br>of microbial resistance will be to the<br>global economy and while at the moment<br>even into microbial resistance is<br>predicted to account for about 700,000<br>deaths they predict that by 2050 the way<br>we're tracking at the moment globally<br>it's going to account for about 10<br>million deaths will exceed cancer as the<br>is a cause of mortality I mean there<br>will be a nun even burdened with the<br>greater burden in less developed<br>countries versus those that are<br>developed there's also going to have a<br>massive impact on the global economy and<br>they estimated that there'll be a<br>hundred trillion cumulative u.s. dollars<br>GDP loss due to into microbial<br>resistance so have we got here what can<br>we do about it<br>so we can take those services from the<br>CDC the public health lab and there in<br>the US and it's simplistic view of our<br>mentor microbial resistance but it sums<br>it up rather nicely so we can have<br>become resistant by maybe by mutation to<br>an antibiotic then you give someone an<br>antibiotic and you select out that<br>organism and it's able to take over and<br>proliferate and but unfortunately it's<br>able to pass maybe other passes genes on<br>to another organism in horizontal dream<br>gene transfer it's actually far more<br>important then mutation for this fred of<br>resistance many of the genes have been<br>related to resistance they're not even a<br>single gene they may be an operon<br>requiring several genes and it's not<br>possible to drive it by<br>alone but these genes are passed from<br>one bacteria to another then we provide<br>a selective pressure and it's able to to<br>spread around in fact they've been<br>studies recently that have looked and<br>looked done<br>meta genomic sequencing of material from<br>the permafrost so a hundred thousand<br>years before we ever started using<br>antibiotics and many of the antibiotic<br>resistance genes that we're worried<br>about today were present already in the<br>permafrost because most of the<br>antibiotics that we're using and made by<br>microorganisms and we've just joined<br>them as aware for our own use for the<br>resistance mechanisms already exist and<br>it all it takes us further that for<br>those genes to transfer into clinically<br>relevant species for significant<br>resistance so mobile genetic elements<br>are sort of central to this there's a<br>number of different players but plasmids<br>transposons integrins or make up a sort<br>of complicated hierarchy so we can have<br>these resistance genes that get captured<br>by integrins and integrated into these<br>gingka sets of resistance genes these<br>can remove me be sitting on mobile<br>genetic elements such as transposons and<br>plasmids that are able to move between<br>different bacteria and then we also have<br>resistant strains of bacteria as well<br>that seem to have a better predilection<br>for infection than some other other<br>strains so these mobile genetic elements<br>they accumulate resistance genes leading<br>to multi-drug resistance they also<br>accumulate resistance genes for heavy<br>metals in disinfectants as well so when<br>we're using one class of antibiotic<br>we're providing a selection pressure to<br>maintain other resistance genes as well<br>and even when we may perhaps when we're<br>using disinfectants such as triclosan we<br>may be providing a selection pressure to<br>maintain in microbial resistance genes<br>in the population as well these genes<br>don't just certain one bacteria they<br>move between bacteria and they can we<br>can think of this on a whole ecosystem<br>level as well so we can have<br>transmission between human beings and<br>hospitals and at home and in the<br>community<br>many of these back these resistant gram<br>negatives living in the in the gut most<br>of living in the gut and they passed out<br>in the feces where we can if we haven't<br>got adequate search system we can<br>contaminate the environment and<br>contaminate surface groundwater and in<br>fact as paper that just came out a few<br>weeks ago that looked at rivers throwing<br>through the river flowing through the<br>Indian city of Pune and they could find<br>all these carbapenem A's genes and also<br>the NCR one gene present from the sludge<br>that was in there was the sediment that<br>was collected from from the river so<br>these things are in the environment from<br>the environment they can get mate<br>now they these papers that show that<br>while birds can trends shorebirds can<br>transmit transmit clinically relevant<br>genes and can get into crops and soil<br>into livestock and flowed back into<br>under human to human beings as well so<br>we need to think of this on an<br>ecological level not just on a hospital<br>or a healthcare base level and we are<br>increasingly close where many parts are<br>well very close to our environment there<br>is a lot of antibiotic usage in the<br>agricultural sector so in the u.s.<br>there's almost four times more<br>antibiotic used in farming than there is<br>a human medicine and while we're<br>relatively we're pretty good in New<br>Zealand where I'm third best in the list<br>of countries something cool from the<br>OECD and I've narrowed us at the top and<br>then USA down the bottom so we are much<br>better than the US but and I think we<br>should applaud our visionary colleagues<br>because of they've put out a statement I<br>think last year where they said that<br>their aspirational goal was that by 2030<br>that New Zealand Inc will not need<br>antibiotics for the maintenance of<br>animal health and wellness so they're<br>trying to reduce the energy bottle use<br>to reduce their selection pressure<br>unfortunately as a medical profession we<br>are not as good in fact New Zealand's<br>got pretty high rates of antibiotic<br>resistance and if we look at some of the<br>countries that we are surrounded by it<br>doesn't make necessarily pretty reading<br>we think we might think we're good but<br>we're using more than Spain or<br>it's countries that we often think of as<br>using large amounts of antibiotics in a<br>five arrowed there at the bottom<br>Netherlands and in France at the top and<br>there is a clear association between the<br>amount of antibiotic there's used in the<br>rates of resistance so I've a France<br>area up at the top and Netherlands down<br>at the bottom again is to give us a sink<br>where New Zealand might sit in so these<br>veins and we're probably sitting<br>somewhere up here this is looking at the<br>amount of outpatient use event of<br>penicillins<br>this is the rates of penicillin on<br>susceptibility and streptococcus<br>pneumoniae in a clear correlation what<br>we really need is new antibiotics but<br>the drug pipeline is running dryers<br>looking new FDA approvals over five year<br>intervals or than last was not quite<br>five years but we can see a decline and<br>the investment and antibiotics buy and<br>development of new antibiotics five drug<br>companies and there's a huge cost<br>barrier to bringing a new antibiotic to<br>market it's the East made it and it<br>costs over a billion u.s. dollars and<br>would take well over ten years to get a<br>new antibiotic into the clinic so we<br>really need to change our model of<br>funding drug development whi recently<br>put out a global priority list for<br>antibiotic resistant bacteria to to<br>provide some guidance to industry as to<br>where antibiotics need to be developed<br>or what we need them for and<br>unsurprisingly at the top was carbapenem<br>resistant organisms particularly intro<br>bacteria ACI they the in extended<br>spectrum be led to mazes as well should<br>note that TB is not was not included on<br>this list as it's already recognized as<br>a massive priority for antibiotic<br>development and in fact of those deaths<br>that we currently have from<br>antimicrobial resistance over a quarter<br>it can be attributed to resistance and<br>tuberculosis so what is TV just a quick<br>refresher so it's a chronic infection of<br>the lungs causing a granulomatous<br>disease and the lungs TB and fix<br>macrophages as contained in so you<br>inhale TB then infects the macrophages<br>able to survive in the macrophages<br>you<br>formation of granulomas which containers<br>in most cases but when you become<br>immunosuppressed these can start to<br>break down and can develop active TB and<br>become infectious coughing up and fixers<br>Vasili infecting other people and it's<br>estimated that two billion people are<br>latent ly infected with Mycobacterium<br>tuberculosis worldwide say chest x-ray<br>of someone with TVs other classic right<br>upper lobe right upper lobe<br>consolidation and some s of fast the<br>Salone the sputum so there's still a<br>major issue so 10 2 million people were<br>thought to be leighton the infected<br>potentially able to reactivate over 10<br>million new cases in 2015 that's the<br>most recent figures from the w-h-o and<br>estimated to be 1.4 million deaths in<br>2015 you can see that there's a<br>overrepresentation and sub-saharan<br>Africa and there's sort of a CO epidemic<br>with them HIV infection because TB is<br>very slow growing so for example a coli<br>replicates every 30 minutes<br>TB takes about almost a day to replicate<br>and it's lies dormant and macrophages<br>for for many years it gene transfer is<br>horizontal gene transfer is not such an<br>issue in G B mutation tends to develop<br>through mutation but because it's the<br>slow growing nature and for some drugs<br>the limited number of mutations that are<br>required for driving resistance<br>resistance is an issue and if we use a<br>single drug we all select out a<br>resistant population so you need to use<br>at least two effective drugs because it<br>takes such a long time to grow in them<br>and in the lab we use start off with<br>four drugs to make sure that at least<br>two are effective and then once we've<br>susceptibility results we can drop back<br>to two drugs still need to treat for a<br>long time at least six to nine months to<br>get rid of the very slow-growing mica<br>bed to him to be closest there are a<br>number of barriers to treatment to TB<br>that are driving drug resistance so the<br>long treatment durations are you imagine<br>you've got to take pills every day<br>for six to nine months and you've got to<br>have hired hearing so you if you aren't<br>taking the drugs in you there's the risk<br>of developing drug resistance people get<br>lost to follow-up the regimens complex<br>they toxic they interact with the HIV<br>making medications which is a big issue<br>in sub-saharan Africa and increasingly<br>we're seeing primary infection with<br>drug-resistant TB so multi<br>drug-resistant TB can be defined as TB<br>that's resistant to at least<br>isoniazid and rifampicin which to the<br>most effective frontline drugs was<br>estimated in 2015 they're almost half a<br>million cases of multi drug-resistant TB<br>diagnosed and almost a quarter of a<br>million deaths resulting from it and you<br>see with the burden of multi<br>drug-resistant TB is and much of its is<br>in fact and the Indian subcontinent but<br>also in there in Russia um even greater<br>concern we've seen the emergence of<br>extensively drug-resistant TB or xdr-tb<br>so this is TB that's not only resistant<br>to isoniazid and rifampicin but also to<br>our second line drugs such as any Furyk<br>win alone at least one of the three<br>injectable signal agents that we've got<br>and these have been reported around the<br>world including in Dunedin we had New<br>Zealand's first xtr case and it's<br>estimated be almost 10% of XTR treatment<br>of MDR and XDR TB is complicated<br>requires combinations of second and<br>third line drugs which are expensive<br>more toxic less effective need to be<br>treat need treat for longer so up to two<br>years or even longer and the treatment<br>success rates are greatly reduced so if<br>you look at susceptible TB patients on a<br>global basis 83% of people successfully<br>complete treatment with MDR and 52% and<br>here's the data for India here from the<br>TB recent report I mean I guess of<br>concern is the large number of people<br>who are lost to follow-up or who failed<br>as these are drivers for development of<br>XTR T V and the success rate with extr<br>and TB is even lower at 28% so this is a<br>of a massive global concern<br>I mean the concern would be that we're<br>going to end up back here<br>in the sanatorium so with that gloomy<br>message I will pass over how hard so is<br>going to talk to you about some possible<br>solutions<br>can anyone hear me at the back not<br>flying at anyone Z is great I think I<br>switched you slide zone awesome so if<br>James has convinced you to start<br>planning for an apocalypse hopefully my<br>talk can talk you out of that so what<br>we're talking about is some work that<br>we're doing on concept redeveloping new<br>antibiotic themselves as well as<br>treatment strategies so what I'm talk<br>about is is focused on TB mainly this<br>idea of starving TB as a really new<br>effective drug strategy so I'll go into<br>what that means<br>so James covered a lot about<br>antimicrobial resistance what I'd also<br>like to highlight is this concept of<br>antimicrobial persistence that is when a<br>bacterium when challenged with a jug<br>will form a sub population of cells that<br>are resistant to antibiotics but not<br>because of a genetic change in their<br>genome not acquiring any horizontal<br>elements they simply are physiologically<br>resistant to antimicrobials we consider<br>both resistance and persistence one<br>major challenge combined that we need to<br>deal with if we're going to do with<br>problems like MDR TB as well as other<br>organisms like Staphylococcus and<br>Salmonella as well so what we'd really<br>like to do is to transform the treatment<br>strategies with TB so in this picture<br>here you can see this is one day of<br>treatment with TB that is injections<br>many drugs toxic not very not very<br>pleasant<br>and additionally can involve extra IV<br>infusions as well and that can last from<br>an order of six to thirty months that is<br>extremely hard to deal with is not<br>tenable for treatment and that leads to<br>lots of cases of non-compliance which<br>obviously gives us more resistance feed<br>spat creates a cycle so our goal is to<br>try and get from where we are now with<br>these extremely long six to thirty month<br>regimens and get to get to really short<br>and effective<br>therapeutic to preferably in the order<br>of two weeks we're already starting to<br>make a few steps some recipes about<br>drugs what we're going to focus on is<br>this drug addict problem so what do we<br>need we need drugs that are fast but we<br>also need to understand how they work<br>otherwise we'll never be able to<br>innovate on them so Bataclan is first<br>drugs have been licensed in 40 years as<br>a 40 year innovation gap where we had no<br>new treatments or TB was using the same<br>old drugs getting more and more<br>existence and that's how he ended up<br>here today but that one is very<br>revolutionary and the reason for that is<br>it doesn't target a traditional target<br>space it's not so ruled by a bio<br>synthesis it's not a ribosome targeting<br>it's not folic acid it's targeting<br>targeting respiration and central<br>metabolism by that I mean the process by<br>which bacteria take say some sort of<br>food or energy source they metabolize it<br>to make biomass and produce ATP<br>there's central energy source whilst<br>consuming oxygen this is that that<br>classic equation that you might have<br>learned back in high school we have that<br>glucose going into co2 and o2 it's that<br>it's that process and what we're<br>focusing on here is this this process of<br>respiration at the actual means by which<br>we make that essential ATP it's<br>obviously a lot more complicated in this<br>diagram there are lots of proteins that<br>sit in the membranes of bacteria which<br>are involved in transducing the energy<br>in food into far more easier to utilize<br>proton gradients which by which we can<br>efficiently synthesize ATP so what the<br>decrement does is it specifically<br>inhibits the ATP synthase in in<br>tuberculosis bearing in mind that humans<br>obviously have very similar metabolism<br>in the mitochondria we have ATP synthase<br>as well doesn't target that targets TV<br>so it's only been fda-approved for about<br>five years now on compassionate<br>consideration for treating TB but I've<br>already learned quite a few things which<br>I'd like you to take home mainly to make<br>messages today that is through Bataclan<br>we learned<br>this respiration is a new and potent<br>target space for calling it the sixth<br>target space<br>what Bataclan has Auto taught us is that<br>activating respiration or indeed<br>activating enzymes generally is just as<br>effective as developing inhibitors to<br>enzymes now both of these concepts<br>aren't exactly new concepts if you work<br>in cancer you already know this but<br>that's bacteria people where we're a bit<br>slow that's why we work on more<br>simplistic model systems but hey we're<br>getting there and we're starting to get<br>some really good stuff out of this so<br>respiration so here's some of the<br>original data on the DAC ones so you can<br>see on the left here this is Cynthia<br>graph to show the specific inhibition of<br>ATP synthesis activity with the decalin<br>is quite effective loan loan animal<br>amounts you don't need much to inhibit<br>the ATP synthase by creating a genetic<br>mutation you can eliminate that activity<br>so far that specific mutation hasn't<br>been seen clinically although things<br>such as effects pumps do come up so<br>obviously want to innovate on this but<br>what I'd really like to point out is<br>this kill curve here the colony forming<br>units per mil over time you can see in<br>the blue and the green here if you take<br>that with declan and up to micro molar<br>amounts which is the amounts you put<br>into a TV patient during therapy it gets<br>up to about five more kamal and a plasma<br>you can sterilize free growing TV<br>cultures in an order of a few weeks so<br>but to the limit of detection here which<br>is obviously much better than other<br>drugs say ionizer the currently is first<br>line drug we've seen a purple it goes<br>down persistence kicks in not genetic<br>resistance persistence and then it comes<br>back and then we have a big problem for<br>treatment so what we wanted to know is<br>can we target other sites and<br>respiration yet-to-be synthases only one<br>part of a very long versus I'm only<br>going to talk about one aspect today<br>although we've investigated several and<br>that's oxygen consumption so we all know<br>option consumption is quite important I<br>think we can all appreciate we quite<br>like oxygen ourselves and<br>many organisms do TB for example<br>dedicates two enzymes to consuming<br>oxygen which is important in generating<br>those gradients for ATP is upstream of<br>ATP synthesis so there's two enzymes<br>once called a cytochrome bc1 a3 and the<br>other is called a cytochrome B D and<br>there was a struggle as a discovered<br>computer free for phenotypic screening<br>and what we were able to show is that it<br>targets this one of these oxygen<br>consuming enzymes that was simply<br>demonstrated by deleting the other<br>potential enzyme for consuming oxygen<br>and showing a nice inhibition here we<br>have reasonably low IC 50s but a real<br>key result that I want to highlight and<br>this work was done in TV as well as in<br>clinical isolates of TV is if you<br>compare it to predict : GTO free makes<br>with that look like a bad drug so you<br>can see this shift of ic50 here with q2<br>every compared to PDQ<br>it's just Mars way orders of magnitude a<br>less drug required to inhibit growth but<br>also if we're going back here and take<br>this mutant strain mark honestly deleted<br>now some a dodgy resistance cassettes<br>and you treat a mouse and you take the<br>CF use for the lung in the green here is<br>that mutant treatable cute chauffeuring<br>you can see in a mouse sterilization in<br>an order of a few weeks and so now what<br>we had popped asides from that is if we<br>can get an inhibitor against this other<br>enzyme and combine it with kyouto free<br>we potentially have an extremely<br>effective regimen to take through into<br>further leaf optimization so if you've<br>seen our ugly mugs in the paper recently<br>yeah this is the research that led to<br>this so this this actually was published<br>in PNAS which is a leading academic<br>journal so now I'd like to move forward<br>and talk about the second aspect of the<br>that thing that's really transformed our<br>treatment and that is this idea as<br>activators as well as inhibitors for<br>dealing with bacteria<br>so somewhat we published a few years ago<br>now we showed this interesting effective<br>Bataclan on mycobacteria that is if you<br>give mycobacteria by Declan again coming<br>back to oxygen and in many ways other<br>ways does the Declan in this case<br>actually increases oxygen consumption in<br>whole cells and does not inhibit it and<br>the reason why this is important is the<br>idea of persistence when you become<br>persistent or slow growing a very low<br>metabolic activity that means that cell<br>will antibiotics drugs like that that<br>usually target growing cells aren't<br>going to work anymore so this is<br>important as you can see here this<br>fantastic experiment done by<br>collaborators in Maryland TV is if you<br>look at the oxygen consumption rap TV as<br>a function of oxygen concentration you<br>see TB in the wild-type<br>in the pink will very quickly stop<br>respiring quite as fast in response<br>decreasing oxygen it doesn't want to you<br>use that ball of its oxygen it's an it's<br>an obligate arrow<br>it can't get anaerobic otherwise game<br>over and what the decrement does<br>increasing amounts in light blue and<br>dark blue is causative to dis regulate<br>this option consumption consume<br>continues consuming oxygen till it gets<br>down to almost as a lower concentration<br>is in a hypoxic tumor microenvironment<br>so not only do they run out of oxygen<br>you've caused them to stop but stop slow<br>growing the no longer persistence<br>they've come ana persistence reactivated<br>whoops<br>I'm acceptable to frontline drugs again<br>so that's kind of the idea we went<br>forward can we take this idea make some<br>activators and see if we can target<br>other espíritu proteins because I've<br>been harping on about oxygen for a bit<br>too much now I'm going to switch text we<br>obviously have time done some of these<br>studies with oxygen I'd like now to talk<br>about a compound called NADH so this is<br>a lot further upstream in the pathway<br>this is right at the entry into the<br>start of respiration this is high energy<br>electrons from which you derive the<br>energy key compound produced by central<br>carbon metabolism or what going to the<br>tells so we discovered this compound QQ<br>Etsy what we discovered is that if you<br>take the proteins in TB that catabolized<br>this to release its energy and transduce<br>it it activates that process as you can<br>see here in this graph on the right<br>what's really nice again is this length<br>of time needed with this compound to<br>sterilize the culture again we're in an<br>order of two to three weeks again<br>comparing to the eyes and eyes of<br>control what just comes back so this was<br>quite a surprise actually because we<br>just wanted to create synergistic<br>combinations and instead what we<br>actually found was activating<br>straight-up knocks out TB or in this<br>case this is BCG but we did confirm the<br>results with TB and again this work was<br>also published only last year and we're<br>now moving forward to try and see if we<br>can create some interesting combinations<br>for paradox from this kind of idea so<br>what I would like to sort of finish off<br>on because I'm aware I'm sure you guys<br>probably want to get to other pressing<br>matters is that we've taken these two<br>sort of concepts and motion together to<br>look at even more effective antibiotics<br>and unfortunately I can't really tell<br>you is that those compounds are because<br>of intellectual property reasons the<br>patents aren't you ready yet but what<br>I'd like to do is just show some of the<br>killed data we have again I told you our<br>goal is to get two treatments that are<br>in two week time frame and he considers<br>compound X in a free growing culture of<br>TB that is aerobic it takes about three<br>days to sterilize the culture complete<br>sterilization and we can take this out<br>for a lot longer and we have not yet<br>observed resistance compared to positive<br>controls that would normally give<br>resistance what is really nice though is<br>if you grow these greater TV up till it<br>becomes hypoxic emulating resistance<br>this compound X makes the Declan look<br>like a terrible drug bearing in mind but<br>that is actually a fantastic drug<br>this is all relative so you see by<br>Declan here you get the hypoxia at the<br>compound you get a little bit decrease<br>in the viability which is enough there's<br>this other compound compound Y sort of<br>the same thing we think it's a mimic of<br>Baudette :<br>this compound X however again complete<br>sterilization in a few weeks so<br>basically I'm going to say as mum is<br>watch this space we're taking us through<br>into sort of animal models doing some<br>med chem currently the only problem we<br>foresee so far as high clearance rates<br>but otherwise once we get around<br>medicham and that should be very<br>interesting so what I've told you guys<br>today is through this compound Bataclan<br>we learned that metabolism respiration<br>it's a great target space we don't need<br>to restrict ourselves to thinking just<br>about inhibitors that's also turning<br>enzymes on as well and altogether we've<br>kind of learned a lot about how to make<br>better drugs so I'm moving forward we'd<br>like to move forward from TV and into<br>other organs as well standing to do work<br>in Staphylococcus Listeria as well as<br>considering moving into yes PL juicing<br>e.coli<br>so that ends my presentation and I just<br>wanted to highlight that I'm only part<br>as a small part of a large team so I'd<br>like to find thank everyone in professor<br>cooks lab which is when I'm calling me<br>at our go back to energetics and<br>antimicrobial resistance group bit of a<br>mouthful but the acronym was Oh bear<br>although I really wanted an acronym that<br>was Oh beer but I will so with that I<br>finished pretty well on time and we'll<br>have to have some time to take some<br>questions<br>catch oh thank you I'm just really<br>interested in I think I saw one of those<br>article that came out on the weekend and<br>talking about the the gang kids having<br>antibiotic levels which were sooner to<br>what we're trying to achieve in the<br>human bloodstream if your treatment so<br>there's a huge obviously huge antibiotic<br>pressure on organisms to develop drug<br>resistance<br>what happens if they actually move down<br>to God correct what happens if we take<br>antibiotics out of the agricultural<br>production do we stop getting bugs<br>reverting to do we know what happens<br>will they revert to resistant organisms<br>again there will be an energetic cost<br>for the bacteria and maintaining these<br>genes some of them are on placements<br>that are going to have addiction systems<br>so that they the victory can't lose the<br>plasmid so they're also exquisitely<br>regulated often so switched on when<br>they're required so I think if I mean<br>it's speculation I don't think we have a<br>good example I mean I guess well if you<br>reduce antibiotic Geese you'll see a<br>decrease in the rates of resistance but<br>I think it's unlikely go away I think I<br>think a nice answer that actually comes<br>from the permafrost obviously we have<br>don't really have great evidence at the<br>moment well I'm not familiar with it<br>they make some may exist but if you look<br>at the permafrost example far before the<br>advent of antibiotics there was D<br>antibiotic resistance genes so they're<br>already there before hands and they're<br>already going to be there in the future<br>after we leave if we leave so I imagine<br>it's always going to be a problem that's<br>always always sort of there so I guess<br>what I'm trying to say is we need to not<br>sort of rest on our loans like we did<br>for the past 40 years and just sort of<br>keep trying to iterate what I've got at<br>the moment but I think when you've got<br>such heavy contamination of the<br>environment<br>I see German it's been demonstrated in<br>India and parts of a developing world<br>when there's not necessarily good<br>sanitation when there's easy access to<br>mental products with a lot of antibiotic<br>manufacture occuring and one of that's<br>being poured out into rivers we're still<br>not entirely certain what role that<br>plays and this the cycle I guess of<br>these genes coming back into the human<br>demonstration failures marketing system<br>isn't it the market it's been the sell<br>as many any buttons they can not just<br>means that you know people make profits<br>out of using an agricultural people feel<br>they can feel better if they buy keep<br>kind of gardens and that makes it very<br>difficult to develop new drugs which are<br>then going to be you want to keep in<br>reserve for the special infections<br>actually it's not much incentive to<br>develop that's I think a crack solution<br>this new drug development is that if she<br>developed a new drug the Brendan and<br>gentlemen and ing we want to keep it on<br>shorter time as possible so there isn't<br>a great economic incentive here I think<br>in the developing countries there's not<br>me through the regulatory framework that<br>we have have here and then you can't in<br>there is really access to to these<br>pharmacy you don't need to go to<br>pharmacy to give antibiotics you give<br>them from the corner shop and I think an<br>agriculture there's perhaps even this<br>even this regulation I think is also a<br>big issue in countries where the<br>antibiotics and the publicly funded and<br>so the patient estimates shell out for<br>six to thirty months of antibiotic<br>themselves in most cases those people<br>choose not to do that because I'd rather<br>feed their family<br>so that's also the flip side of the<br>issue is that if you know if the<br>companies do make the money and<br>country's about that kind of<br>infrastructure it's the you know the<br>people who have the disease of infection<br>that suffer there's actually a<br>microphone in there so hopefully it's<br>turned on properly Kyle okay moving on<br>to target organisms like staphylococci<br>and gram negative organisms and how you<br>can get around the problem that if you<br>target the respiration they'll just<br>switch to anaerobic metabolism that's<br>that's a great point so that's something<br>we're actively trying to look in at the<br>moment whilst we haven't published some<br>of the data it's definitely a lot of<br>work in a laboratory that suggests that<br>there's clinical relevance to some of<br>the NADH consumption genes but you can<br>also take genes for example complex 2<br>which is called a sucks ad hydrogenase<br>in Staphylococcus there's lots of<br>studies where they've treated them<br>deletion mutants of these in mice<br>infections and seen quite quite a big<br>rip in a reduction virulence so whilst<br>there's definitely fermentation<br>strategies that bugs seem to be able to<br>use in pure culture to escape this<br>inhibition we kind of hypothesized that<br>in in a site of an infection of course<br>may be more essential in a genome might<br>give us the idea so another question for<br>you Kyle so that was sort of my question<br>too but the related question is bacteria<br>respire at different rates so do you<br>expect that sensitivities will differ if<br>you transfer out of TB and strains that<br>have different respiration rates or<br>that's that's that's actually a<br>fascinating question so I guess we don't<br>really have a lot of fundamental<br>understanding about the if you if you<br>for example clot<br>a graph will say m IC minimum inhibitory<br>concentration to the you know sort of<br>nominal rate that the bacteria respire<br>we don't really have a good comparison<br>there I think for many bacteria has<br>actually lost there's lots of literature<br>linking respiration in general to<br>virulence so you know as far as a yes/no<br>sort of an circuit I can sort of say you<br>know if we knock it all out with a drug<br>that'll be very effective but as to sort<br>of conceptually answer that question<br>that's a very interesting academic<br>studying any much give me an idea in<br>five years time to write a girl and<br>maybe a quiz all right when the<br>questions was about the dormancy of TB<br>normally which I guess is respiratory<br>determined and perhaps is it and<br>granulomatous conditions even more hard<br>to get to the last one if it's still<br>sort of lying dormant of it's resistant<br>yes so I think this is the idea I think<br>that something we did when he touch on<br>is this idea that in that persistent you<br>know hypoxic micro environment in the<br>granuloma whilst I'm not growing they're<br>still metabolically active they're still<br>aspiring they need to they need to turn<br>over but it's only dirt there's only<br>it's a flux through this respiration<br>process so it's still active so<br>conceptually yes all the persisters<br>should still need to respire as for<br>getting the last one in the granuloma<br>the real barrier may actually be getting<br>a job to penetrate into the barrier and<br>into the granuloma so I think the<br>challenge there is actually going to be<br>in actually getting the drug to the<br>bacteria rather than making a drug<br>effective in that case but I think if we<br>can achieve at least sort of a great<br>enough reduction in bacterial load<br>hopefully the the body would rather take<br>care of the last bits itself just to<br>calm it the whole thing is a bit like<br>gun control in America to me the it's a<br>humanity induced problem which there's<br>too much in terms of secondary gains to<br>it<br>actually deal with the problem directly<br>so if every culture has depended on<br>conditioning due to ending microbials<br>and mess of scales we seem to be<br>fighting ourselves eternally without<br>ever going to get on top of it yeah<br>that's definitely a valid point and that<br>in a very political level that sort of<br>maybe speaks to perhaps a more<br>government level regulation of how we're<br>using our antibiotics although perhaps<br>at a sort of more personal patient level<br>I would argue that it's not the fault of<br>the person you've got TB that there's<br>entering my gradual resistance it's the<br>fault someone else so that becomes<br>philosophical question who do we who who<br>can we can we say we should choose to<br>save someone or choose to not because of<br>say one person learning for the rest of<br>us I think with the issue of how much we<br>can get rid of I mean we clearly we need<br>antibiotics we need to use them well<br>when you try and reduce the Selective<br>pressure but we all still want to be<br>able to use antibiotics when we want to<br>be able to use them whether that is the<br>New Zealand memory Association clearly<br>feels that they can their inner products<br>are not required for other than<br>treatment in prevention of disease<br>they're not required for growth<br>promotion and now I'm looking to get rid<br>of that and from a mirror from a medical<br>perspective I think we need to look at<br>using the narrow spectrum antibiotic we<br>can using for shorter duration as<br>possible and using it only when we need<br>to to use it to try and reduce the<br>Selective pressure that they're still<br>going to be a selective pressure but<br>hopefully we can preserve what we hear<br>for a little bit longer and allow our<br>development of new drugs which is<br>clearly what we need and we need things<br>like these new targets that outside the<br>sphere of their current range of range<br>of targets and be great to see the news<br>in a miracle Association or our other<br>professional groups from take a lead<br>from the New Zealand Veterinary<br>Association and<br>come up with some targets for reducing<br>antibiotic usage and certain certain<br>circumstances and then proving into my<br>future<br>I mean I think there's dogma and it's<br>wrong so I think yes we've always said<br>take your antibiotics till the end of<br>the course because we're worried that<br>the bug we're treating might develop<br>resistance during treatment the reality<br>is the most antibiotic resistance isn't<br>due to mutation there's a few examples<br>on loans where it is rifampicin but<br>majority cases it's equally shanira gene<br>all we're doing by treating for longer<br>is providing more selective pressure we<br>shouldn't be worried about if we're<br>treating a throat infection the bug in<br>the throat becoming resistant we need to<br>be worried about you think of that<br>antibiotic on the gut microflora and the<br>Selective pressure that it's providing<br>there so I would argue that we should be<br>looking to treat for a shortest time as<br>short a time as possible and they're<br>very they're not a lot of good studies<br>about duration we often don't know what<br>the appropriate aeration is there are<br>exam in there clearly examples like<br>endocarditis and bone and joint<br>infections where we do need to go for a<br>long time you know know something about<br>duration but there's been a couple of<br>studies have come out recently renewing<br>a journal from the end of last year that<br>showed if you've got an abdominal sepsis<br>if you've got good control our surgical<br>control then four days and finally if<br>you've got there's reasons they can I<br>said if you've got ventilator-associated<br>pneumonia but you're relatively stable<br>then three days of antibiotics is<br>probably all right so do we really then<br>need to treat someone with bronchitis in<br>the community for ten days although one<br>come in our dad's familiar with that<br>research and I believe the study was<br>treating patients until they felt better<br>so I argue that we need something but<br>more standardized than when a certain<br>patient feels like their goods because<br>that's just really not scientific at all<br>and it could lead to undertaking the you<br>know the course far far more than they<br>should sorry<br>you know we kind of need the better<br>there's<br>for improvement yeah and there is<br>actually a great scientist in the back<br>of the room who's starting to develop<br>some of these technologies at first for<br>TV and that is the use of whole genome<br>sequencing at this case as a diagnostic<br>tool Myanmar's TV as these technologies<br>become more available I would actually<br>like to see that more rapid routinely<br>used as a broad diagnostic test so<br>that's still a long ways off<br>but that would be my hope is that we can<br>make simple whole genome sequencing<br>available because obviously the benefit<br>is we detect all kinds of resistance as<br>well as happening I mean I guess it<br>depends a lot in fiction as the mean if<br>it's a urinary tract infection in one<br>doses of antibiotics probably sufficient<br>even definitely and most people are<br>going to get better anyway even if you<br>get the ma'am not nonsteroidals to<br>alleviate symptoms there's not that much<br>people don't get they're much better<br>they much quickly on edge products and<br>they do if they take non-steroidal<br>anti-inflammatory drugs so I mean I<br>guess the a lot of our use of<br>antibiotics has to be questioned I mean<br>at a broader level you could say that<br>maybe if there was better access to<br>primary care it was cheaper then maybe<br>you could be reviewed and say okay well<br>you're much better we can stop after<br>three days and five days whereas there's<br>quite a financial disincentive to go<br>back and to see the GP in our current<br>setting given that it so you essentially<br>that's actually a great point they've<br>actually been several drugs that<br>actually been developed and seem to be<br>effective by some actually invited down<br>to Dikembe herbs and it's research and<br>yeah here's great sons and great drugs<br>that have come through they've not been<br>patented and no companies taking them up<br>to mass-produce them because the IP was<br>already out there so I guess that the<br>thing is we need to we comes back to<br>this idea the financial incentive for<br>the company if we don't have any kind of<br>financial aid essentially for the only<br>the only people who can mass produce and<br>deliver a drug then simply great drugs<br>guns at the table so you know it sounds<br>kind of heartless to say I'm not gonna<br>tell you about this great drug because I<br>need to paint it first but if I don't<br>paint it then I might as well go home<br>and sell my ass and do nothing okay so<br>thanks very much for an excellent<br>seminar James and Kyle and it certainly<br>generated some really good discussion<br>here and yeah I wish we could keep going<br>but it's just gone two o'clock so you<br>feel George are close so thanks again</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
