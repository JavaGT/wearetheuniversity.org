It is based on reflective practice and the translation of biomedical theory to day-to-day medical work.<br><br>GENA820 provides a systematic review of the foundational concepts of medical practice; it aims to examine the academic and philosophic underpinning of modern medicine. http://bit.ly/2ygqYu7</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I was in a time in my career where I<br>could actually take a break from<br>full-time medicine and start to sort of<br>exercise my brain in a kind of different<br>way and I remember looking up the<br>website to start seeing which papers<br>were available and eight - oh the<br>description see that's going to reenact<br>all work and I thought well if it's<br>going to promise that then I can give it<br>a go it's given me a framework to kind<br>of be able to reflect on some of the<br>things that I didn't have words for<br>before the the challenging patient<br>situations where I come away from it<br>thinking that didn't go well<br>and that would be the end of my<br>reflection on it and just thinking I'm<br>glad that's over and move on whereas<br>after eight 20 in some of the<br>discussions and even the assignment<br>writing that went with it I've been able<br>to reflect more on why the particular<br>situations were uncomfortable and how I<br>can improve that and being more<br>comfortable with the uncertainty of<br>general practice and how to improve<br>rather than rather than just ending up<br>doing is you were doing in a safe kind<br>of a way that you can still continue to<br>be better at this job that's challenging<br>day to day it may be frightening to go<br>back to thinking about the philosophy of<br>Medicine or re-examining why you're<br>doing medicine but I think that's an<br>important part to be able to continue<br>with the enthusiasm in stay in what is</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
