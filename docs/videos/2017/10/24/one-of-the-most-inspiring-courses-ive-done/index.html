It is based on reflective practice and the translation of biomedical theory to day-to-day medical work.<br><br>GENA820 provides a systematic review of the foundational concepts of medical practice; it aims to examine the academic and philosophic underpinning of modern medicine. http://bit.ly/2ygqYu7</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I was in a time in my career where I<br>could actually take a break from<br>full-time medicine and start to sort of<br>exercise my brain in a kind of different<br>way and I remember looking up the<br>website to start seeing which papers<br>were available and eight - oh the<br>description thing that's going to<br>reinsure<br>clinical work and I thought well if it's<br>going to promise that I can give it a go<br>so I've done it - Oh which is nature<br>practice and then I'm doing it two three<br>now which is teaching and learning in<br>medicine so there was very much a sense<br>of I wish I'd done this sooner and and<br>certainly for the other participants in<br>the course who are like me fairly mature<br>and compared to some of the participants<br>who were younger a sense of gosh it's<br>really good for them to be exposing<br>themselves to this information not to be<br>sharing this experience with colleagues<br>and developing their understanding and<br>their appreciation of of their practice<br>and what they're about beyond do I<br>prescribe this medication and this for<br>this condition but where is it all set<br>what am I trying to do here am i just on<br>the hamster wheel seeing patient after<br>patient or is there a bit more to my<br>practice and idiot 20 paper as made me<br>feel very good about being a primary<br>health care worker but being a GP in New<br>Zealand<br>I've been working as a GP probably for<br>about about 12 years and enjoy the job<br>very much but was looking to do some<br>additional study and I have to say<br>nature of medicine was probably one of<br>the most inspiring courses I've done it<br>was collegial in the sense that group<br>just being with a group of other GPS at<br>a similar point in varying points in<br>their careers and was very refreshing<br>and it felt very supportive in terms of<br>developing new thinking about<br>you're doing and new ways of approaching<br>practice I get a lot more enjoyment from<br>my practice I enjoyed it before but I<br>enjoy even more now there are facets to<br>my practice which I didn't pay<br>significant attention to before which I<br>do now and I feel that actually I'm I'm<br>becoming more directed in my learning<br>with regard to future practice as well<br>it's given me a framework to kind of be<br>able to reflect on some of the things<br>that I didn't have words for before the<br>the challenging patient situations where<br>I come away from it thinking that didn't<br>go well and that would be the end of my<br>reflection on it and just thinking I'm<br>glad that's over and move on whereas<br>after 8 20 in in some of the discussions<br>and even the assignment writing that<br>went with it I've been able to reflect<br>more on why the particular situations<br>were uncomfortable and how I can improve<br>that and being more comfortable with the<br>uncertainty of general practice and how<br>to improve rather than rather than just<br>ending up doing is you were doing in a<br>safe kind of a way that you can still<br>continue to be better at this job that's</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
