This session will help you decide which electives you would like to take in 2018.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you for your attendance I think we<br>might get underway and the attendance is<br>not great but that's not a concern so<br>much because the session is being<br>recorded so if anything is unclear and<br>you want to listen to the recording for<br>that clarification subsequently or if<br>you have friends or flatmates or<br>whatever who couldn't be here I would<br>like him access to the information about<br>next year's courses then assure them<br>that this will be online and certainly<br>well before enrollments open on the 1st<br>of November so I'm Steven pink one of<br>the associate deans I have the honor of<br>facilitating this gathering for the next<br>two two and a half hours it's something<br>that we do annually to advise you about<br>the elective courses that will be<br>offered next year and also and before we<br>get into the specific courses we need to<br>talk a bit about enrollment processes<br>and particularly as this time around<br>there are some changes so there's a<br>variety of materials available here on<br>the table at the front and the ginn for<br>other people that couldn't be here feel<br>free to take copies for them and this<br>scenario for next year is about 98%<br>settled so there are still a few<br>outstanding issues to do with assessment<br>of some particular elective courses that<br>we need to pin down but otherwise we've<br>given you up-to-date materials as far as<br>possible reflecting the situation as of<br>this morning I say it's incomplete<br>because the law school is going through<br>the moment at the moment through a an<br>academic appointment process there will<br>be some new academic stuff joining us<br>next year at the following that process<br>it's possible that one or two or more<br>elective courses would be added more<br>likely in the second semester then in<br>the first next year so if somebody's<br>currently teaching let's say in a<br>northern hemisphere law school and we<br>offer them a position and they accept it<br>and then they give their usual period of<br>notice of six months we may not see them<br>until May perhaps next year and it may<br>be that they can offer additional<br>elective course or courses in the second<br>semester<br>before we get on to the specific courses<br>you'll see from the agenda that there<br>are some generic things to cover and in<br>addition to what's printed there there<br>are a couple of things that I want to<br>add one is specifically to do with<br>enrollment processes which we'll talk<br>about in a moment and the other is to do<br>with the availability of mass discursive<br>2-part for students so it's possible to<br>include one or two masters courses<br>within your LLB or ll be honest debris<br>as electives in part four might have<br>some detail about that later in the<br>session<br>alright just an overview of the degree<br>structural it's not very clear there<br>that's from the loss now the law<br>undergraduate prospectus at least some<br>of the course codes are clear but the<br>blue indicates the core courses within<br>the LLB degree and the elective courses<br>are the rear door orange ones that come<br>in parts three and four and students<br>sometimes are not sure how many points<br>they need an elective courses and they<br>sometimes get confused about the status<br>of legal ethics and whether or not it's<br>elective it is elective within the LLB<br>but it's a requirement of course for<br>admission to the bar so the starting<br>point in working out how many points you<br>need in parts three and four is that<br>across parts two three and four of the<br>degree the law courses need to total 360<br>points now most of you will have<br>completed part two inclusive of law two<br>nine eight law two nine eight carries<br>ten points so that makes part two 130<br>points as you can see out on the right<br>of the diagram part three is a hundred<br>and twenty points and if you have done<br>law two nine eight then you need only<br>110 points in part four to make that<br>overall total of 360 if you're one of<br>those students who did the old law 299<br>up to 2015 before we introduced or two<br>nine eight it had zero points and for<br>you part two we'll have consisted of one<br>hundred and<br>20 points only only for power 4 will<br>need to be 120 points to make up that<br>overall total of 360 so 360 is the<br>starting point deduct the blue and the<br>rest are electives make sense<br>if any of this is unclear there will<br>undoubtedly be opportunities during the<br>session where we may be waiting for<br>somebody to come and present about the<br>course where we can revisit any of these<br>generic issues if you wish all right<br>students who are doing honest on top of<br>all of this do a further 60 points so<br>there's a 20 point honest seminar which<br>is normally taken in part three but it<br>could be in part four and then there's a<br>40 point dissertation which is a piece<br>of individual research resulting in<br>about 15,000 word paper that has<br>submitted which is weighted as 40 points<br>and that comes in the semester following<br>the completion of part 4 so the<br>regulations say if you're in honesty<br>your dissertation must be submitted not<br>later than the end of the semester in<br>which you completed the powerful<br>requirements for the LLB degree<br>eligibility for honest students who have<br>completed part 2 can be invited to<br>transfer to the Honors Program and they<br>will need at that stage an overall<br>weighted average of 75% so we're looking<br>at the max rather than the grades or the<br>grade points and we are taking into<br>account the results that you got the max<br>that you got for Lauren society and<br>legal method and criminal and public and<br>torts and contract and 4 to 9 8 or<br>weighted s 1530 or 10 points<br>respectively and as long as it comes out<br>for all 270 5.0 or higher then you'll be<br>invited to transfer to the honors<br>program invitations for those who are<br>completing part 2 this year and you meet<br>that requirement I will be sent out in<br>the middle of December and you have<br>until the middle of January to accept<br>the offer to transfer to honors if you<br>wish and to indicate what your preferred<br>honors seminar course would be for next<br>year once we've had all those responses<br>some honors seminar courses will be<br>oversubscribed and so we will have to<br>make a selection and some students may<br>get their second or even the third<br>choice of Honor seminar<br>all of that you would know by about the<br>20th of January next year and time if<br>necessary to amend the courses that<br>you've enrolled and in the meantime all<br>right let's talk about enrollment<br>processes because there are some major<br>changes so firstly if you are already<br>beyond part two you're in part three<br>then you're in the ll b3 group which<br>means part three and for students and<br>from the 1st of November onwards you can<br>enroll in your course that's finished<br>yet subject just to really prerequisite<br>considerations now we don't know exactly<br>when on the first of November<br>enrollments will open but the<br>indications are that it will not be at<br>midnight and it's more likely to be at<br>breakfast time than at 2:00 or 3:00 in<br>the morning and what the university is<br>concerned about is that it has allowed<br>students to start enrolling from the<br>night and about 80% of law students are<br>enrolled within a few a house of that<br>midnight opening but the system<br>sometimes can't cope and there's no IT<br>support available in the middle of the<br>night and so I think the university is<br>going to open enrollments probably<br>around 5 6 7 a.m. but so how early is<br>breakfast but the messages don't stay up<br>all night on the 31st of October you<br>might have a frustrating experience if<br>we know with any certainty when the<br>enrollments will open what time<br>precisely will it you know okay so if<br>you are currently in part 2 and this<br>year we'll be completing part 2 so next<br>year you're a prospective we'll be a<br>part 3 student in the past it has not<br>been possible to enroll in any part 3<br>courses until mid-december it hasn't<br>been possible to enroll from the 1st of<br>November because the university has<br>required us to check that you have in<br>fact completed all your part 2<br>requirements which we can only do when<br>the part 2 grades are finalized in<br>December and then move you to the law 3<br>group and the year after you can enroll<br>and so that has meant that the students<br>moving from Pat 2 to part 3 have been at<br>a disadvantage in terms of securing the<br>preferred streams and land equity in<br>elective<br>courses and so on the process has now<br>changed if you are enrolled in courses<br>this year that will complete part two<br>either you're doing the whole part two<br>what you're doing the second half of it<br>which you did the first half last year<br>we will assume that you will pass the<br>sheis courses and you can provisionally<br>enroll for part three from the first of<br>November so you can have equal access to<br>your preferred streams of the compulsory<br>courses and so on if indeed you fail<br>something and you haven't completed part<br>two then we will have to intervene and<br>perhaps just enroll you when we discover<br>that sometime in December but that will<br>affect very few students because their<br>pass rates in Pat two are very high if<br>you are currently so doing the second<br>half of part two you're completing part<br>2<br>no sorry you're doing the first half of<br>part two now so next year you want to<br>you need to complete part two and you<br>simultaneously want to make a start on<br>perhaps three well it's been possible in<br>the past has been on the first of<br>November to enroll in you are<br>outstanding part two courses so let's<br>say you're doing at the moment law to<br>know that crimes in public Nikoli you<br>need to do torts in contract you can<br>enroll in torts in contract and nothing<br>else has been possible until mid-january<br>again that has changed and so you will<br>be able to enroll from the first of<br>November in the outstanding torts in<br>contract and in elective courses to make<br>a start on part three concurrently with<br>your completion of part two is that<br>clear anybody not following it<br>well you have a shoot about enrollment<br>processors and makes those handouts and<br>so thing that I have skipped the first<br>item on the list other than the<br>statement that enrollments open on the<br>first of November<br>it's in respect of prerequisites for<br>elective courses up until now virtually<br>every elective course has had as its<br>prerequisites the whole of part two now<br>therefore students of a completing part<br>two and want to start part three haven't<br>been able to do anything for part three<br>because they haven't completed part 2 at<br>least we gave them a concession and<br>typically between 50 and 60 students<br>would apply for concessions each year we<br>have refined we have reduced the<br>prerequisites for the part 3 elective<br>courses and so now the whole of part 2<br>is a prerequisite is a typical it's<br>unusual the prerequisites for elective<br>courses will now be a subset of the part<br>2 courses and as long as you have passed<br>those or you we anticipate that you will<br>pass them this year then you can go<br>ahead and enroll and elective courses to<br>make a start on part 3 at the same time<br>so you have some information there about<br>the prerequisites for elective courses<br>the revised list so just to take my own<br>privacy law as an example it's only<br>prerequisites our public law and torts<br>so anybody who this year will have<br>passed public law in torts will be<br>eligible to do privacy maybe while<br>they're doing crimes and contract in<br>2018 and so it is with the other<br>electives as well<br>alright I think we've briefly covered<br>everything else that's on that page<br>hitted enrollment and electives for 2018<br>north 4-9-8 and North $4.99 caused some<br>confusion so let's just talk briefly<br>about those prior to this year the usual<br>requirement at the end of the degree was<br>that students and this is reflected in<br>the law 499 enrollments would have<br>participated in a moot above part 2 so<br>either the faculty moves in part 3 or 1<br>if they may be competitive or subject<br>related moots so long as it has be on<br>part 2 and have written five pieces of<br>writing over certainly 1,500 or more<br>words sole or $4.99 has been about<br>breath of writing and participation in<br>one moot and students enroll in law for<br>nine nine at the end of their degree now<br>that doesn't mean that they can only<br>satisfy the requirements than the allows<br>semester that you satisfy them across<br>parts three and four but the enrollment<br>comes right at the end and that's just<br>our opportunity to gather up the bits<br>and pieces that you've done and make<br>sure all the boxes attacked that has<br>been replaced by law four nine eight<br>and here the emphasis is not on a number<br>of written assignments but one sustained<br>piece of writing of at least 4,000 words<br>plus a move beyond pad 2 so now there<br>are only two ticks required in two boxes<br>one is the Moot box and the other as a<br>piece of sustained writing or 4,000 or<br>more words can complete it somewhere in<br>the course of your law studies north or<br>9/8 replacing law 499 is required of<br>most of you nor 499 continues to be<br>available only for students who were<br>already in part three before this year<br>and it's being phased out at the end of<br>next year so it's just retained in a<br>transitional way for students who are<br>expected to complete $4.99 most of you<br>will be enrolling in law 4-9-8 again you<br>enroll in it right at the end but you<br>may complete your mood and your 4,000<br>word or more piece of writing at any<br>stage during parts three and four so<br>it's not related but<br>completion that satisfaction of those<br>requirements isn't linked to the actual<br>enrollment of a loved one only does that<br>make sense<br>knots and no shakes of the head okay<br>well I will assume that you've<br>understood that thank you<br>the four thousand or more word piece of<br>sustained writing single piece of<br>writing can be satisfied in a number of<br>ways so again just to take my own<br>elective course as an example you will<br>see four privacy law that there are two<br>ways in which students can be assessed<br>everybody has to complete a thousand<br>word research oh sorry a thousand word<br>essay which contributes twenty percent<br>of the final grade for the other eighty<br>percent it can be either a two hour exam<br>or a research paper in lieu of that exam<br>on some privacy topic and that research<br>paper has been deliberately styled or<br>fashioned as a 4,000 word piece so that<br>it satisfies the requirements for all<br>four nine eight so by doing the research<br>paper in lieu of exam<br>you're basically killing two birds with<br>one stone satisfying the law four nine<br>eight requirement and avoiding an exam<br>by substituting for it a piece of<br>sustained writing in the elective and<br>papers in lieu of exam are available in<br>most elective courses and even we're on<br>this chart that you've got the<br>spreadsheet that you've got which shows<br>the assessment even though it may not<br>say a paper in lieu of exam it's always<br>open to negotiation with the teacher of<br>early elective course to be able to<br>substitute a research paper in lieu of<br>the exam that you otherwise would be<br>sitting so papers in lieu as long as<br>they're four thousand or more words<br>satisfy the law four nine eight<br>requirement a supervised research paper<br>of ten thousand words that's a 15-point<br>elective which allows you to write on<br>any area of law whatsoever so long as<br>somebody on the staff is prepared to<br>supervise it that clearly will satisfy<br>the requirement for law four nine eight<br>or four thousand or more words in a<br>single piece of writing every on a<br>seminar paper of ten thousand words will<br>satisfy that requirement every honors<br>dissertation a fifteen thousand words<br>obviously satisfies the requirement but<br>for those of you that are not honor<br>students just remember there is a<br>requirement that somewhere along the<br>line in part three or four you need to<br>have written<br>a single piece of at least 4,000 words<br>and a paper in lieu of exam or a<br>supervised research paper may be the way<br>to satisfy that requirement and the last<br>thing just to mention briefly at this<br>stage but we'll give you some detail<br>about it later is what I mentioned at<br>the start and that is some of our 30 or<br>so masters courses that we offer each<br>year are available also to undergraduate<br>students who are in part four so if you<br>look at the range of masters courses for<br>next year and there is something there<br>that is attractive to you it may be that<br>it's one of those courses where we<br>welcome undergraduate students and it<br>can be taken in substitution of a one or<br>more undergraduate electives and the<br>masters courses are weighted as either<br>30 or 15 points an important thing to<br>note about those masters courses is that<br>they are assists differently from<br>undergraduate electives masters courses<br>are assists typically by way of research<br>papers only with no exams so there are<br>negative and positive reasons for<br>thinking about masters courses in your<br>LLB degree one is that if you're not an<br>exam oriented student you can do<br>something that has no exam you can write<br>a research paper on some aspect of the<br>master's course or it may be that the<br>subject matter of who has discourses of<br>particular interest to you and you can<br>therefore include it within you ll be<br>impaired for and of course all of those<br>masters research papers in lieu of exams<br>are of 4,000 or more words so they're<br>going to satisfy the law of 4-9-8<br>requirements as well so that's just<br>another option for satisfying law for<br>nine times but the masters courses<br>you've got the honors seminars the<br>honors dissertations papers in lieu of<br>exam for supervised research more than<br>one way to skin a cat or to satisfy four<br>or 4-9-8 requirements all right well<br>that was a bit of a speedy half survey<br>of some of the generic matters we now<br>two specific elective courses for next<br>year and as I said we've allowed five<br>minutes for the teachers of these to<br>present to you about their courses and<br>hopefully that will include details of<br>how the courses will be assessed next<br>year but if we hit a low not a low patch<br>a deed patch and the middle of all is<br>because we might get ahead of schedule<br>then we can revert to some of those<br>generic things if you wish so I am<br>teaching women law next year more<br>general feel to - so this here to say a<br>few words about that what we basically<br>do and woman and the law is we go<br>through the different bodies of feminist<br>legal theory all of which have<br>contributed to our understanding about<br>how the law supports or potentially<br>addresses aspects of gender and equality<br>and we start with liberal feminism which<br>is the reason why I'm standing here<br>today and why some of you in the room<br>are enrolled it on all degree for those<br>of the you don't realize woman and the<br>law women actually entering the legal<br>profession did so relatively recently<br>even though we had the first female<br>graduate many years ago in 1970 when our<br>Chief Justice graduated she graduated in<br>a class in which there only four woman<br>she struggled to get a job and then she<br>actually went on the bench to practice<br>the kind of law she aspire to practice<br>realizing that she can never be briefed<br>and the kinds of files that she aspired<br>to hands so we looked at liberal<br>feminism with a radical feminism<br>cultural feminism critical race or<br>intersectional feminism and postmodern<br>feminism and these different bodies of<br>theory look at well why if women have<br>been entering the law school for about<br>30 years and equal or even greater<br>numbers to men why are they not<br>progressing or why are they still only a<br>tiny fraction of those holding positions<br>of power can we actually have any<br>political agenda organized around the<br>concept of women when women have such<br>other diverse intersections and tower<br>attributes that are associated with<br>gender impregnated and non human<br>concepts like the Lord we understand<br>look at theory with some practical<br>issues so why what are some the<br>difficulties in combining a career in<br>law with motherhood issues of sexual<br>violence against women issues of care in<br>contact<br>disputes in the context of family law<br>the criminalization of Greenville<br>failures to the good<br>protect because family violence and<br>basically what we're trying to do is see<br>how theory and the lens you put on a<br>social phenomenon actually affects your<br>analysis and your outcomes in relation<br>to that phenomenon trying to make the<br>theory kind of real we have great guest<br>lecturers in this course and<br>documentaries I'm not sure who will have<br>this year yet but last year we for<br>example people Louise Nicholas who with<br>will be familiar to you as the<br>complainant and relations multiple<br>sexual violence charges against police<br>officers in the past is now a victims<br>advocate we had Sandra allure TV and<br>Laverne King who set up a firm based on<br>tecum amaldi' only employed Modi and<br>Pacifica woman who couldn't get jobs<br>elsewhere and set their own crash so<br>they could combine motherhood with a<br>career in law which is always a<br>challenge for women and many other<br>fantastic gift letters so assessment is<br>by way of three journal entries of a<br>thousand words each and the best two are<br>worth 30 percent of a final grade and<br>they're really inspired to encourage you<br>to read the reading information in the<br>area of theory and critically reflect on<br>them including relating them to your own<br>life and finally a 4,000 word opinion<br>your choice which is worth seeking at<br>the scene of the course so just a brief<br>reflection on why you might like to take<br>this course it has had very positive<br>feedback from students so that's always<br>a good sign it's one of the few courses<br>I have personally taught that students<br>have told me they've found actually<br>life-changing because many young women<br>of this generation actually haven't been<br>exposed to feminism like some of us<br>older women so actually just being<br>exposed to these ideas it's pretty<br>exciting and many of them still have<br>relevance for our lives and I think also<br>taking a course that's critical around<br>theory really assists if you're planning<br>on doing great lawyer in so I draw a<br>distinction between good lawyer in where<br>you apply the law to try and get the<br>best possible outcome for your client<br>and great lawyer in which actually<br>involves pushing the legal envelope so<br>that might mean creating a listening for<br>your client that doesn't currently exist<br>amongst a group of people that don't<br>have life experiences that naturally<br>lend themselves to understanding your<br>clients life circumstances it might mean<br>persuading judges to be brave and<br>overturning legal orthodoxy to achieve<br>more just outcomes in other words it<br>requires critical reasoning and a fist<br>occator understanding of concepts like<br>equality which of course we I see it<br>to most of the theory in this course why<br>you should not do this course do not do<br>take this course because that is an easy<br>option postmodern feminist theory is<br>super exciting but it's absolutely not a<br>thief and don't take this course because<br>you have a timetable clash well though I<br>will say that one of my favorite<br>students ever the woman in the law was<br>someone who took it because he had a<br>timetable clash so at the beginning of<br>the course I've gone around and asked<br>everyone why are you involved in this<br>course and he said he was hoping to be<br>invisible and silent and simply survived<br>the course because he had bought a<br>soccer franchise and it was the only<br>elective for certain clash with his<br>French eyes and I laughed hysterically<br>thinking gosh she's what he and then<br>realized he was deeply earnest<br>so I went up to her and I said why don't<br>you take privately of course why don't<br>you take a supervised research paper<br>it'd be a lot less work and you could do<br>it on top of franchising of something<br>you really<br>anyway he rejected that idea he said he<br>was finding of course he'd noticed it<br>was a bit sexist that he was finding the<br>course quite interesting anyway and he<br>was one of those very open-minded people<br>who actually explored things that he was<br>reactionary to and he ended up<br>transforming a lot of his thinking and<br>being really quite excited and engaged<br>by the core so maybe you should take the<br>course if you have a timetable okay if<br>you do will you come up with one later<br>on feel free to email me thank you good<br>afternoon I'm going to teach maritime<br>law next year my name is Matthew Flint<br>I'm currently practicing as a maritime<br>lawyer in Auckland and I've been doing<br>that for five too long I've been doing<br>for 28 years and it's been fascinating<br>I've been all around the world as a<br>maritime where I've been on ships and<br>Iceland and Brazil and Portugal and I've<br>been in boardrooms and Germany Greek<br>shipowners Hong Kong Singapore its are<br>really very international subject<br>there's a huge amount of practical<br>experience practical application both<br>domestically and internationally it's<br>always changing and we need young<br>lawyers to be coming through with a good<br>understanding of how that works both<br>domestically and globally I'll just give<br>you a very quick I thought I'd show you<br>some pictures because there's a lot of<br>good stories with shipping Lloyd's<br>little reports which is a very<br>substantial<br>law report is full of shipping maritime<br>law cases for many many years the<br>insurance industry the Greek shipowners<br>have funded Cigna<br>in litigation particularly involved in<br>contract law if you're really interested<br>in contract law this is a substantial<br>way to get your head around and get in<br>some really substantial contract<br>contractual law issues I'll just forward<br>let's give you a quick definition<br>maritime law there's a functional term<br>used for describing a whole range of<br>laws and other legal sources that govern<br>the legal framework relating to ships<br>and their operation it includes a<br>variety of legal systems ranging from<br>international law to regional and<br>national laws and down to local rules<br>it covers issues of public concerns<br>it'll be familiar with some of the huge<br>environmental issues that have arisen<br>out of major pollution incidences from<br>ships safety security piracy to become a<br>really interesting issue for us cyber<br>and cyber security is now something that<br>I'm dealing with a lot environmental<br>protection as well as civil law matters<br>contracts of carriage liability<br>compensation for damage salvage and<br>rules relating to marine risks and<br>insurance to name a few so we use this<br>course to teach a lot of fundamental<br>legal principles particularly on<br>contract law using shipping as a<br>framework<br>okay so you'll get a really practical<br>overview on how you stand up and get<br>into court get in front of clients and<br>and advise them on these issues<br>particularly contract ok needs some<br>pictures just to give you a flavor of<br>maritime law beautiful example of the<br>rights of two vessels in the auckland<br>harbour many years ago somebody on the<br>surfboard and an American warship okay<br>our job is to work out who's one of them<br>what's going on here from a legal<br>perspective<br>who's got the rights who's got the<br>obligations does that warship have to<br>stop for somebody on a surfboard okay<br>what happens if there's damage what<br>happens if the ship stops can't move<br>okay<br>these are the kind of things we'll be<br>looking at here's a man in the Western<br>Sahara I'm dealing with this right now<br>he's a member of the people's front in<br>the Western Sahara so far not registered<br>it or known as a UN country that they<br>own they came to own all the phosphate<br>in Morocco in the Western Sahara it's<br>the best phosphate in the world New<br>Zealand needs it he along with his group<br>claim ownership of it okay the Moroccan<br>government thinks otherwise the Moroccan<br>government sells a whole shipload of<br>their product to New Zealand and this<br>ship arrives in South Africa and legal<br>proceedings are started let's stop that<br>ship from moving anywhere else in the<br>world that ship has arrested the only<br>thing you can arrest other than a person<br>there's a ship okay so how does that<br>happen by a fantastically developed<br>historical process which allows maritime<br>rule is to do that okay you stop a ship<br>take the cargo off and there's<br>Stachel that cargo is worth a fortune<br>there's all sorts of interesting legal<br>issues that we're dealing with on that<br>okay<br>ship runs aground on the southern coast<br>of England okay this is happening all<br>the time you'll see this happen often<br>all the containers fall in the water<br>they start going ashore<br>and look what happens people from<br>Cornwall decide that they are entitled<br>to the contents of the containers<br>particularly why they claim I'm not<br>joking they tamed historical Cornish<br>rights of collecting what comes ashore<br>on the beach completely wrong because<br>the collector of customs and in the UK<br>had a completely different idea the same<br>things apply here so I've been watching<br>they've been watching Poldark okay this<br>is a marathon but the issue as to<br>whether those people are lawfully taking<br>their cargo away on the beach you can<br>help themselves to it there's a really<br>interesting area of maritime law okay<br>some Australian scientists were down in<br>Australia and down in time to cure a<br>couple years ago I was involved in this<br>case they decided that they had to get<br>back to the ship the captain of the ship<br>she's get back there's some ice coming<br>in I need you back quickly on the ship<br>the Australian scientists going on such<br>a hurry what's the problem they take<br>their time to get back on board the ship<br>what happens that ship gets stuck in the<br>ice okay big issue then for me to advise<br>on what happens next the cost of getting<br>those people off the ship as opposed to<br>leaving them there for a few weeks and I<br>was all for leaving Australian<br>scientists as long as you need to as<br>opposed to incurring millions to give<br>them helicopters off because they would<br>be concerned about the cold raises all<br>sorts of interesting issues okay<br>contractual law issues that were<br>involved in this is the Rena<br>you'll all be familiar with it of New<br>Zealand the master of that ship was<br>totally at fault for putting that ship<br>on the reef<br>he paid nothing for any of the damage to<br>the cargo okay<br>so how can it be you think about some of<br>the contractual things you're thinking<br>about a liability regime for domestic<br>sailor purchase this is quite different<br>okay well it's absolutely all the time<br>and we there's a lone maritime law<br>issues just in that photographs alone<br>this could happen in the Auckland<br>Harbour big ship coming in and some<br>people just out there enjoying<br>themselves I've dealt with those cases<br>you look at what's going on here who's<br>got rights away who's responsible for<br>the damage what happens if the ship gets<br>held up for two two days while they try<br>and collect the bone off it some very<br>interesting liability issues in<br>compensate<br>merci other day the biggest carry in the<br>world had a cyberattack which stopped<br>their entire logistic systems they<br>didn't know what was in any of those<br>containers for two days all over the<br>world delays the ship's ups are running<br>out of time here's the future we're<br>looking currently doubt unmanned ships<br>the liability regime we're going to talk<br>about all these issues my last favourite<br>shot somebody somebody's canoes capsized<br>got on board a submarine okay this would<br>love the issues in there we're going to<br>do the course by having a two lectures a<br>week in the evening at five o'clock<br>because I'm working five up in the<br>evening eight o'clock on Friday more and<br>on Monday on Friday morning so Tuesday<br>five o'clock Friday morning at 8 o'clock<br>we're going to do a couple of good to a<br>course assessment by running a couple of<br>scenarios which I'm going to get you all<br>to go and research and write think about<br>I'm going to choose about three<br>different potential case potential<br>problems go research and and hand that<br>back and that's going to be 20% of the<br>course towards the end of the course<br>we're going to start talking about major<br>casualty pulling it all together and the<br>exam is going to be focused on sitting<br>down and looking at actual real life<br>scenario and analyzing it for yourself<br>and working out what you're being taught<br>these are some of the answers this is<br>some of the advice you might give your<br>an entirely new religion thank you sir<br>my name is Stephen price and I'm the<br>head of the construction division at<br>mentor Allison here in Auckland<br>beginning up about 30 odd construction<br>lawyers but there's a certain amount of<br>idea of just what is happening at the<br>moment and in terms of both the<br>construction law practice what's going<br>on in terms of construction and we we<br>think it's going to be going in the<br>future I'm really excited to be offering<br>and presenting the course next year<br>it's astounded me that has taken this<br>many years with respecting for the<br>universities to pick up on it and<br>particularly meaning that there of being<br>for some years now substantial<br>specialized practices around the country<br>and what we are seeing nowadays are that<br>firms are realizing more and more just<br>how important the practice of<br>construction law is going to be so what<br>does construction law and I like to<br>think about it without unfortunately<br>saying pretty pictures as if you think<br>about if you're going to build a<br>building what happens and it's quite a<br>long life cycle you've got to get<br>planning underway you've got to get the<br>contracts of procurement your statutory<br>requirements or C it up if you've<br>actually then got to build something and<br>get all of the specialist people to be<br>able to build that along the way and the<br>end up you've got to make sure that at<br>some time how it's going for budget how<br>it's going in terms of quality your<br>local council requirements all signed<br>off and then your reconciliation at the<br>end what we call project closed-off and<br>invariably you then depending upon the<br>project anything up to the next 15 years<br>of your life spent in litigation<br>fingers crossed that's where I come in<br>so as you can see from there that had<br>quite a wide range of issues they are<br>primarily contractual and primarily<br>statutory and the first half of that is<br>a lot of government procurement rules<br>need to understand a lot of governance<br>issues that come up and then at the<br>letter heart or what my colleagues<br>unkindly call the back end part of the<br>practice you end up having very<br>complicated technical both legal and in<br>terms of expert concepts litigation and<br>I often say to people if you really want<br>become a litigation lawyer do<br>construction law for a while I've got a<br>number of disputes partners at work I<br>spend more time in court whether it's a<br>high court who have appeal as a pre<br>encorte than any of them because of the<br>nature of the projects the types of<br>legal matters that we'll be having to<br>deal with are going to obviously not<br>just the general contract law but really<br>digging into what we call the the<br>Trinity of time cost in quality and many<br>people have talked about the idea of<br>good cheap fast took any two and the<br>practice of construction law is actually<br>trying to pick all three trying to find<br>a way that the legal risks protections<br>and frameworks are in place so that time<br>has controlled cost is controlled and<br>quality is controlled and every single<br>one of those methods you can dig into it<br>as contractual whether it's going to be<br>statutory whether it's going<br>to be even in two areas and taught the<br>important area that I see for New<br>Zealand at the moment is that we know<br>that this demand is only going to<br>increase so there is going to be an<br>increased demand for construction<br>lawyers over the next easily next team<br>in 20 years but what is wonderful about<br>construction or is that the concepts<br>that we practice in New Zealand whether<br>it's in relation to the litigation or<br>the procurement or the advice any of<br>those concepts are essentially the same<br>with you go to England America Australia<br>the Middle East and so it's a very<br>international practice and that means<br>our practice and the practice of<br>construction law has international<br>relevance that also has the<br>international opportunity is<br>unfortunately I see or to many of my<br>staff now working overseas as far as the<br>course is concerned it's intended to be<br>two lectures a week<br>a two-hour and one hour both in the late<br>afternoon because I too have to work I'm<br>going to be assisted by a couple of my<br>colleagues I'm going to have Taylor<br>who's over here with me assisting one of<br>my fellow partners Janine here also has<br>a lot of involvement in the disputes<br>part of it but we are going to be<br>assisted by another of my partners here<br>at Sinclair who's considered to be New<br>Zealand's top energy and procurement<br>construction lawyer and so she'll be<br>able to talk to the government ethics<br>procurement has Biggs involved in those<br>the assessment is going to be a 1500<br>word written<br>assessment and also an open book exam I<br>was tempted to make it<br>a lengthy research paper but my view is<br>that to the important part of<br>construction law at the moment is going<br>to be that the knowledge the<br>understanding the practical ability to<br>do something on the fly rather than have<br>to research it because it we have them a<br>practice perspective the real demanders<br>I've tried to keep that within five<br>minutes but I'm very happy to take any<br>questions if I've missed out anything<br>that people want to know about so just<br>about construction will be in the second<br>semester and the prerequisites contract<br>and - very good<br>thank you thank you Steve my name is<br>head of living you haven't met me yet I<br>and so a minister from what is the<br>course that i will be that i will be<br>teaching and it's not new but it will be<br>different next year from this year<br>because this year my colleagues<br>portraits are they buy the difference of<br>course if you talk to past minister of<br>course students last year's version is<br>ratified to what you find next year so i<br>taught a class in 2016<br>in this year and obviously I work too<br>much<br>so what submission for about a change<br>will come across an introduction<br>connection public or services particle<br>it is the law that governs decision<br>making by public authorities and public<br>entities so for example on a phone into<br>your Center once a month to run a clinic<br>there under furniture floor and the<br>kinds of clients that have year PhD if<br>they come up pretty much at the time<br>that each exactly at work to do the work<br>wins work in income and decision making<br>HCC decision making it has an easier<br>decision making right so that's an<br>example of the kind of entity there<br>video clip integration would be another<br>example that they have a separate<br>session of click on that so I don't tend<br>to deal with ever the pencil sub and<br>then all that happens that information<br>decision-making is very much part of the<br>finisher at all as is resource never too<br>indecisive a structural where it comes<br>into building consents that kind of<br>thing and so it ranges right from very<br>much individual decision making that<br>affects people lives and what a personal<br>interest to commercial interests are<br>Congress Commission decision making for<br>example or construction consenting and<br>for projects so it's this relevant to<br>both of those ends and the rule if when<br>to a better rule that governs this kind<br>of decision making there are essentially<br>four aspects to consider in that context<br>in the school's focuses on three of them<br>the first aspect that the schools that<br>we focus on is vegetation pools in each<br>areas on the rules they have an<br>integration program<br>and welfare benefits or a nativity<br>facade of housing more competition was<br>there Commerce Commission advised right<br>so if you want to start this study the<br>substance of those rules of detail you<br>economic to be specialist courses like<br>immigration or etc but in order for<br>those words<br>operational in those contexts there's<br>also a general principles that govern<br>decision-making by public authorities<br>such as fear procedure adherence to the<br>law or not taking a pendulum towards<br>directions and not disappointing<br>nutritional expectations etc so that's<br>the second aspect of the rule that<br>permits decision-making for public<br>authorities and it's the set of general<br>principles that governs all of those<br>kinds of decisions and that's the first<br>thing that we do study in this course in<br>the remaining two items are too warm<br>remedial process re-enter the next<br>element and the next aspect is what is<br>the role of courts in supervising this<br>kind of decision making so one of the<br>main religion Ebenezer's tradition of<br>working and huge energy estate on<br>deciding just exactly to what extent<br>so that's the is kind of with the<br>unhappy one s orbital or any regression<br>decision you're much much much more<br>likely to be able to that kind of thing<br>so the final thing I want to say about<br>shown that this request subject then is<br>that it really is the sort of<br>foundational subject of public or if you<br>wanted to afford factors in public law<br>news find administer through everywhere<br>and if you want to be a human rights<br>aware where the primary Avenue for<br>protecting human rights and New Zealand<br>is no sort of formal proceedings if you<br>want to protect international<br>obligations again within the domestic<br>system the primary immune system<br>initiative law so therefore I would come<br>into here if you want to be a public<br>aware yes as you had mentioned of course<br>so there's no better subject finally on<br>this of course details and I don't<br>remember off the top of my head was that<br>a timetable as energy you can look it up<br>for yourself<br>four hours a week and worthy two times<br>two hours<br>and mercifully not a date good morning<br>never had last time so yeah she hours<br>are twice a week I am least an<br>assessment I should tell you I haven't<br>decided yet I only last week so I have<br>decided that get bashed I can tell you<br>that we're definitely an assignment<br>which the four century compulsory known<br>for school and almost certainly other<br>would follow meant usual practice of<br>heading with final exam and take home<br>with them which sounds here are some<br>people but actually gives you much the<br>opportunity to produce and which is why<br>I do it<br>think that's worth if I watch the same<br>questions<br>and I had just one thing to add about<br>that course and that is that if you look<br>at the list of prerequisites on this<br>sheet administrative law appears to have<br>no prerequisites whereas in fact the<br>prerequisites are public law torts and<br>contract so only crimes of the part two<br>courses does not need to have been<br>passed before enrolling for Edmund<br>here talk about tax do the for every day<br>I mean he's put in a plug for Matthew<br>Clinton's maritime and of course when I<br>count of messieurs be someone that I've<br>known for a long time and he's a<br>terrific Chapman he is also a fantastic<br>lawyer and up until now I heard about<br>the best sailor in the law school but<br>fairly deep tried everybody can be a<br>sailor verifiable course text is the<br>simple reason but would have might not<br>open textbooks one is that you might<br>want to be a text specialist specialize<br>in text or you can do that and the<br>private sector works with the law firm<br>or big accounting firm or it in you but<br>you also might want to do in any kind of<br>commercial or eating any kind of<br>property war you basically need to know<br>how to Texas during words you need to<br>know if your client is selling property<br>particularly client is selling a<br>property are they've like to pay the<br>income tax on the profits because<br>sometimes they are and now they required<br>to pay GST from the proceeds of sale<br>because sometimes they have they to tax<br>courses there's the basic tax course<br>which happen to the first semester and<br>again the city's minister and the<br>Advanced Course which happen to the<br>supertintin semester if you want to be a<br>tax specialist then obviously you should<br>do both of those and probably if you<br>want to be a specialist to commercial<br>boy every important the it's fairly<br>specialized field text but it is also<br>something that is fundamental to the<br>Opera<br>the Constitution and the political<br>system and the economy so for example at<br>some point at some point this afternoon<br>theoretically we might get to find out<br>who the government is and the the way<br>that will work is that there will<br>probably be much thought a confidence<br>and supply agreement which is something<br>you've probably heard of and possibly<br>know what it is but less you don't what<br>supply needs a supply of money because<br>it might be the case the Parliament can<br>enact any legislation than maybe a<br>parent can take a new legislation they<br>hundreds of statutes every year and if<br>they can't make it or maybe we've got<br>enough or that would never do any out<br>however the government can't spend any<br>money then we have some kind of a<br>constitutional crisis happening the<br>government cannot spend money unless it<br>has a law authorizing it to do that and<br>that is where Winston comes in because<br>obviously the government cannot pass a<br>law authorizing expenditure of money and<br>this monster degrees and that was<br>basically the leverage that he's got<br>over the legal system at the moment so<br>this constitutional importance of tax<br>law of his is say yeah that's the<br>current example of it but it's something<br>that is fundamentally versus but he must<br>make nakata which I guess you might have<br>lived up in your constitutional law<br>class at one point this be the point<br>that Magna Carta is that the king cannot<br>cannot require me to pay taxes the crown<br>you're not required to pay tax unless<br>whatever else the young the that the way<br>it works is ruling it's the Bismarck's<br>typically gets a job at one of the big<br>law firms who sort of knit went down<br>because you talk about the big<br>accounting firms do they get sneaks one<br>down into job within their ribbon you<br>didn't what happens is we've got the job<br>check my truck integrates and goes gets<br>to drop in London everybody moves up one<br>and this possibly by the time you're<br>working in the revenue department you<br>might discover new I got home at five<br>o'clock and say it through this<br>the job at Russell McBain chats going<br>home at five o'clock is sadly fairly<br>slim the basic tax laws come from a home<br>tax system with a little bit of theory<br>of help Texas model with beginning of<br>the income tax in GST at the end the the<br>advance tax course is three parts the<br>first part is more on sort of theory and<br>policy of our taxes reward to work<br>questions like for example whether we<br>ought to have a capital gains text<br>second part was all about corporate tax<br>which is kind of nitty-gritty committed<br>and is the bit that most employers know<br>about and the third part is<br>international trade or different<br>countries and the aim of this course is<br>to introduce students to internet<br>especially human rights so if you've got<br>curiosity about a business because of<br>the law about international law and<br>human rights more than the could be of<br>interest to you and I think that an<br>examination of the international war<br>regarding indigenous people Israel<br>for us in many ways so it's got some<br>scholarly value so when we look at<br>indigenous people relationship with<br>international Florida's institution and<br>actually helps this shoot from like most<br>interesting of ships that have been<br>going on in the international ecosystem<br>and including the firm for proliferation<br>of reward for making institutions and<br>also to grow participation of non-state<br>actors in those institutions so really<br>timely there's been a lot of activity<br>going on at the UN in relation to<br>indigenous peoples in the last 90 days<br>and that's been crowned by the adoption<br>in 2007 of the UN declaration on the<br>rights of indigenous peoples which<br>provides really clear articulation of<br>indigenous peoples rights they've also<br>have been institutions that have been<br>established within the UN that focus<br>exclusively on indigenous peoples we've<br>got for example that permanent forum on<br>indigenous issues the expect mechanism<br>on the rights of indigenous peoples and<br>thus official record for indigenous<br>peoples and in addition to that we have<br>a whole bunch of jurisprudence coming<br>out of the Human Rights policies that<br>are monitoring the main human human<br>rights conditions and so those bodies<br>were also commuting on indigenous<br>peoples and then some specialized<br>international agencies such as the work<br>papers and<br>the others are also teaching or<br>religious tax it is quite as captured<br>quite a lot of different subjects in<br>their space<br>it's also got a lot of practical value<br>so we know that there are around 370<br>million indigenous peoples around the<br>world reflecting about 5000 and in all<br>of these countries unfortunately<br>indigenous peoples tend to be over<br>committed and negative socio-economic<br>statistics and also marginalize the Jews<br>their positions of power so<br>understanding and connection more<br>relevant to indigenous peoples can be<br>one more tool in their tool belt for<br>trying to so the course is going to<br>focus on a whole bunch of different<br>topics and they include who are<br>indigenous peoples we're going to<br>explore this declaration of the radical<br>and we'll look at some of the<br>justifications for indigenous peoples<br>rights and we'll look at these doing<br>constitutions and indigenous peoples<br>we'll examine some of the monitoring of<br>states that's along like you mean are we<br>going to focus on New Zealand and<br>Pacific States and we're also going to<br>talk about the domestic relevance of<br>international war and regarding<br>indigenous people so what does the main<br>will be bring it back to countries like<br>New Zealand and elsewhere we're also<br>gonna mention this loot ordinance<br>jurisprudence that's coming out from<br>Regional Human Rights bodies especially<br>engineer inter-american Court in<br>Commission on Human Rights a little bit<br>of those bodies as well and we're going<br>to focus this particular on some really<br>key rights and including initiatives<br>because rights to the land territories<br>and natural resources and the right to<br>have their free preparing for you see<br>obtained before decisions were made<br>regarding things so this course<br>essentially Frances in collaboration<br>that the university just a specific in<br>Vanuatu so the tools of the course is<br>going to be taught part of an Auckland<br>and half over there but unfortunately<br>you guys don't get to come to many much<br>what it means that for one half of the<br>course I'll be opened to you here with a<br>video really going back you explain<br>better watching and then for the other<br>half it'll be through booth so you won't<br>have a video only watching have these<br>students from the Pacific I'm<br>contributing to these discussions okay<br>so there are three pieces of the six<br>month for this course so there's a group<br>presentation on a topic that's covered<br>in class basically it means when you<br>start the course you will get assigned<br>into a group and your group will be<br>leaving in the class discussion on the<br>sit readings for a particular lecture<br>during the course and you do that during<br>the last time and then we've 20 received<br>there will be a 1500 word reflective<br>okay<br>somebody owns a factory they have<br>heavy-duty equipment question who owns<br>it deep person won't be equivalent to a<br>person's words deep factory we touch on<br>interesting personal property most of<br>the course deals with tangible personal<br>property in other words anything pretty<br>much not Tyco this but I hope guest is<br>personal property we look at the<br>possessions which may seem a simple<br>concept<br>difficult we also consider different<br>kinds of possession and then we move on<br>to the personal property Securities Act<br>only about one and a half classes but<br>the purpose of that is just to make you<br>aware of a very important piece of data<br>it affects has the time to tells you<br>security of personal property the<br>loophole led to the finest cases in<br>other words what if somebody leaves<br>poverty let's say I need my watch hit<br>somebody else's field well I own it I<br>have the primary claim but what if I<br>disappear<br>what if there's our contest between<br>occupied of the lands and some concert a<br>lot of the course will then turn to fail<br>now bear with a very simple arrangement<br>it's nothing more than my tangible<br>personal property I give it to you you<br>are now by Paisley so come and yet<br>concept is not clearly understood and we<br>will look at what the consequences of<br>another person holding could belong to<br>somebody who has a superior and it has<br>not just personal implications but also<br>commercial as well<br>you can play out these various concepts<br>in very profound commercial context like<br>for example the character goods by sea<br>okay<br>that then is the entirety of the course<br>we have a 50% case note and then the<br>balance of the asset<br>is assessed by the time the case noticed<br>a big deal but what I'll do is I'll give<br>you a case you will have a number of<br>weeks to review it and then submit take<br>a step of consider gravity and the<br>challenge is not to write something long<br>but being constrained by I have quite<br>decided words what you'll be screaming<br>for his bore words and the answer she<br>won't get more words so it will<br>challenge you to approach a very concise<br>logical and targeted way and people give<br>you a very useful skill in terms of<br>to look for love everyone my name is<br>Cullen I saw fall and I'm going to be<br>co-teaching I'm South Pacific Legal<br>Studies Orca later couple essentially<br>this paper is all about of producing a<br>research paper because what me and<br>Helene are really passionate about is<br>building scholarship on South Pacific<br>legal issues because there's simply not<br>enough is like one article published<br>every year so we want to try to generate<br>some critical thoughts about the South<br>Pacific and our unique constitutional<br>issue so basically for first semester<br>we'll be looking at the unique<br>historical socio-economic context the<br>islands in the South Pacific existed<br>basically looking at how colonization<br>and posed this whole unique new<br>political and evil system on to us and<br>the unique issues that resulted from<br>that and then and semester two we'll be<br>looking at particular current issues in<br>our constitution it's specifically the<br>conflict between human rights and<br>constitutional values such as in in<br>customary law in the different Pacific<br>Islands we'll be looking specifically at<br>feminism and the Pacific in<br>jurisprudence around<br>that I'm how Pacific woman and then<br>intersectionality between that in terms<br>of land law and sexual assault cases as<br>well we'll also be looking at dispute<br>resolution and the South Pacific we have<br>a very unique way of handling our<br>disputes and how that compares to<br>traditional Western systems<br>we'll also be addressing issues such as<br>tensions and legal pluralism trying to<br>resolve the conflict between your<br>esthetic points of views and<br>perspectives and our collectivist way in<br>the Pacific in terms of our in terms of<br>our course assessment it's all going to<br>be designed around that research paper<br>so first we'll be having research<br>proposal of a thousand words with ten<br>percents the reason why we put the sport<br>is because we wanted students to start<br>thinking about the research topics as<br>early as possible rather than it towards<br>the end of the semester when they are<br>due so making sure that you consult with<br>me and Helene about the topics and get<br>that sorted and then we're going to be<br>doing a presentation as well which will<br>we have the research proposal to be<br>worth 10% the research essay with 75% so<br>a large chunk worth that which will be<br>5,000 words and then there will be at<br>the end of the semester the opportunity<br>for students present their research I'm<br>in front of the class and receive<br>questions and commentary from their<br>peers are there any questions anyone has<br>South Pacific Legal Studies and we're<br>time taking refugee law over the summer<br>Stephen said we're getting in early<br>January really 9th of January it is<br>totally worth giving up your summer<br>holiday to come and do refugee law I<br>think one of the biggest issues that we<br>face globally at the moment is the<br>refugee crisis and it's something that's<br>not going away anytime soon<br>and they can all our lifetimes it's<br>going to be one of the really big things<br>that it's an international community we<br>need to think about and tackle there are<br>currently 65 million people who are<br>displaced from their homes for a whole<br>range of reasons from war to climate<br>change<br>famine political persecution religious<br>persecution the list goes on and on and<br>on what we do in refugee law is look at<br>the system the international community<br>has created to try and help at least<br>some of those 65 million people so we're<br>going to look at the development of the<br>refugee system that has been developed<br>since the 1950s and then we're going to<br>look very specifically as we've had a<br>bit of time looking at exactly who is a<br>refugee and what the legal definition of<br>a refugee<br>is look at who's excluded from it we'll<br>talk a bit about the process eventually<br>bringing a refugee case and the<br>difficulties of proving your case as a<br>refugee and how the system sort of deals<br>that kind of thing and then we'll move<br>along to look at some policy issues<br>around a range of different topics to do<br>there's some commitment to refugee law<br>we'll look at detention issues we'll<br>also look at the extent to which the<br>refugee system fails to sort of<br>accommodate many of the people who have<br>been displaced and some of the<br>limitations of the system it's gonna be<br>a great course I will be lecturing parts<br>of it but it there's also a lot of room<br>for discussion and I'm very keen to get<br>everyone who's taking the course<br>involved in a range of different<br>exercises I also try and bring in a<br>range of different guest lecturers so<br>people who are working in the refugee<br>field some of them work here in New<br>Zealand and Refugee law and the judges<br>or lawyers here others have experienced<br>and working on refugee law overseas<br>there's also for those of you who take<br>the course every year I run an<br>internship program with the refugee<br>court here in New Zealand and the only<br>people who are eligible for the<br>internship program and people who have<br>actually taken this course so something<br>else to keep in mind if you're<br>interested in it in terms of the<br>logistics it takes place over four weeks<br>in January it'll take 15 days three days<br>of every week and three hours every day<br>so basically Tuesdays Wednesdays and<br>Thursdays we'll have three hours a day<br>the assessment will be a test after the<br>first two weeks and we'll cover the<br>first two weeks of material and then<br>there'll be an exam at the end to cover<br>the rest of material yeah my name is<br>John land I'm a barrister at Bankside<br>chambers I contracted for company law<br>so I've been in legal practice for 31<br>years 26 years of the firm called<br>Kensington swamp 20 years as a partner<br>and then five years of pink soap<br>chambers and company law is a really<br>important subject if you want to work at<br>author or become a barrister because it<br>affects so much of what we do and<br>practice and I certainly know from<br>having locked debt we've been involved<br>in recruitment rounds back at back at<br>Kensington Swann that you sort of you<br>have to have done commercial law company<br>law to get to the next stage to the<br>interview stage it's sort of like<br>Stephen Sanders it's it's not compulsory<br>but it's sort of is compulsory if you<br>want to work and private practice in<br>most foods anyway so it's a it's a it's<br>it's it's really important for that one<br>of you assessment 15% on a 1,500 word<br>assignment should be a a problem<br>question probably a company contracting<br>problem question and then the rest is an<br>exam maybe 5% on an exam and the style<br>of this has changed at all but if you're<br>looking at past exams online I presume<br>that it's available for you to do that<br>you might see that normally there's been<br>for for problem questions and you're<br>thinking oh my gosh<br>for hard problem questions over three<br>hours that sounds pretty grueling well<br>I've changed that from the semester on<br>it's now three questions over three<br>hours so it's less of a speed test and<br>more of a true test of your analytical<br>ability<br>in terms of the teaching style what I've<br>tended to do with that is my powerpoints<br>are limited to visual descriptions of<br>cases and a few quotes which we then<br>talk to so let me just give you an<br>example sort of an example of a sort of<br>a case where we we show the relationship<br>between the parties and then we talk<br>through you know what what happened in<br>this case what legal issues arise under<br>the case and we so that that's a sort of<br>a standard sort of slide showing that<br>the relationship between the parties<br>sometimes I led to that with a bit of a<br>chronology but what you're not going to<br>get is a whole lot of detail words which<br>is going to just make it hard to sort of<br>think about the cases that we're talking<br>about so that's an example of a<br>chronology that that's fairly unusual<br>it's usually just the first sort of<br>slide I showed you and then the other<br>thing that we do in the course is at the<br>end of each section of the course we do<br>some practice questions<br>so you just learnt about say directors<br>duties and you've lose about cases like<br>the case that was on their previous<br>slide so then let's submit that by<br>looking at a sort of a sample question<br>the same sort of question that you might<br>get in an exam and we'll go through that<br>together we'll work through that<br>together so we do that at the end of<br>each part of the course and then at the<br>end of the course in the last two<br>classes the last two classes are<br>completely reviewed prior to you know<br>85% exam it's a bit daunting right so we<br>have two classes where we go through<br>mock exam questions which I've prepared<br>and we we work through those together so<br>you get a bit of practice at spotting<br>issues analysing the issues and in<br>talking about<br>how you were then write an exam question<br>so that's the sort of approach that that<br>so any questions all on the approach to<br>the course or why you should or<br>shouldn't do<br>company law and you definitely want to<br>do commercial royalty you'll hear about<br>good so I'm here talking for those of<br>you who don't know me I teach commercial<br>law elective here and basically we cover<br>four statutes in this course and we<br>covered him in a fair amount of depth<br>the first one is a part of the new<br>contracting commercial Law Act where we<br>deal with regime of selling goods and<br>where we learn how you transfer property<br>in goods for example so if you were to<br>go to say whatever shop comes in you<br>mind<br>nothing works for me at home and you buy<br>a new thing in your laptop at what point<br>you actually become the owner of that<br>what if things go wrong what are your<br>rights if there's nothing in a contract<br>where you go and look what what can you<br>do what what redress do you have and<br>then we contrast that with the specific<br>regimes that would apply to consumer<br>goods that are in Consumer Guarantees<br>Act and have a brief look at services as<br>well if time permits and we look at the<br>Fair Trading Act as well so the main<br>disciplines of that because we can't<br>cover everything in that in crop cover<br>some of that doesn't and then the second<br>part of the semester we deal with PPSA<br>the personal property Securities Act<br>where we look at how you can use<br>property and goods as a way of securing<br>other obligations and how you do that we<br>look at when you have one of those<br>interests we look at when it becomes<br>enforceable and what you need to do to<br>protect your situation and then we look<br>at what happens when everything really<br>goes to custard and there are multiple<br>creditors who all want to have that same<br>particular good how do we divide the pie<br>so a lot of that second part of the<br>course is divided this devoted to that<br>particular question so a variety of<br>topics<br>all come under the white banner of<br>commercial law and things that you might<br>encounter on the regular basis or<br>sometimes maybe not so regular when you<br>I haven't fully decided yet<br>because I have experimented this year<br>with reading quizzes which are quizzes<br>that the students have to do before<br>class on canvas and really isn't extra<br>work they just need to do the cases<br>which of course they're all reading<br>before class aren't you<br>hence I've had five of those this year<br>of which live students well had to all<br>of with the best three scores candid<br>towards fifteen percent of the final Mac<br>I am waiting for the current set<br>evaluation to close to see how students<br>feel about us I quite like them and I'm<br>thinking I might it's extend that next<br>year so that maybe there'll be four of<br>them five of them that will count to<br>twenty percent of the grade but more<br>options are almost a real increase for<br>every class and you choose a certain<br>number of those to go for your final<br>grade and the rest would be an exam most<br>likely three-hour exam because I found<br>it quite difficult this year to set<br>appropriate questions for just a<br>two-hour exam so but assignment is still<br>to be determined whether there is a<br>written assessment the to the mixes I<br>show me a towel so you gotta talk about<br>trademarks you've gotta bring along<br>treatments and I liked you on the slide<br>actually because I'm above the trademark<br>geek so when I saw John saliva that's a<br>nice trademark what a tower has got<br>there and when I was talking about that<br>much less thinking there's an Apple but<br>logo it's always always showing my<br>teachers anyway this is a course 14<br>point of course trademark law for those<br>who know something already got into<br>their property so if you know something<br>about a little property you've done or<br>Sumter's into different properties<br>anyone find out more about my cousin has<br>a shape trademark and how had difficulty<br>enforcing this shape trademark needs<br>this is the course for you so it's a<br>course where we will build on<br>foundational knowledge of intellectual<br>property and trade matters<br>water swimming and we will deep dive<br>into some of the curly issues faced New<br>Zealand's trademark law will also look<br>apparently at other jurisdictions who<br>confront similar issues the course will<br>be two hours of entrance per week they<br>are Wednesdays<br>the assessment will be an exam but also<br>a problem type of question which will be<br>really a realistic type problem that you<br>would face if you have to advise<br>my legal issue and it'll be 1200 words<br>what they are about<br>why should you worry about trade - well<br>all the individual property rights these<br>young businesses use trademarks and most<br>all of the most used instrument in<br>bodies young businesses so if you're<br>interested in company more and<br>commercial law chances are you're gonna<br>come across trademark issues a trademark<br>licensing the issues with the sale - its<br>beer in trade maths so really useful and<br>sort of general skill to know about<br>trademarks but also it could be useful<br>if you read down the track of that about<br>being a head an attorney in dealing with<br>trademarks as part of your day to day<br>practice but that's it for me trademarks<br>ten points it's in the first semester<br>and next year and it's Wednesdays and<br>Fridays intellectual property agreement<br>my name is Niki Chamberlin this is my<br>first year mentoring actually at the<br>University of Auckland so next year will<br>be my second year and as Stephen has<br>timely said I will be involved in two<br>electives next year so the first one I<br>wanted to talk to you about I was going<br>to start with a question which is what<br>do married at first sight Hugh Hefner's<br>death and poor old crystal being left<br>out in the cold not getting anything on<br>hair anything after he died and<br>Brangelina have in common they all have<br>to do with family property and so<br>essentially the course the family<br>property is going to be second semester<br>it is 15 points we will be covering a<br>number of really important topics we<br>will be covering relationship property<br>what is relationship property what<br>happens when you separate and you do not<br>have a prenuptial agreement what happens<br>when you separate and you do have a<br>prenuptial agreement can that be<br>challenged what happens if all of your<br>assets are in a family trust and you are<br>only a discretionary beneficiary can you<br>attack that family trust to get money<br>out of it<br>what happens when somebody passes away<br>leaves a will and you're left out of it<br>can you challenge the will or are you<br>stuck with the fact that you've been<br>left out of it what happens if you know<br>somebody dies and they don't leave a<br>will how do you know if you're entitled<br>to anything from their estate these are<br>all things that are covered by family<br>property I personally love the subject<br>of family property because it's not only<br>relevant to legal practice but it's very<br>much relevant to all of our lives<br>I can guarantee when you go out into<br>practice you will most often be asked<br>family law questions out of parties oh<br>you know I'm getting married do I need<br>to sign a prenuptial agreement how do I<br>handle that awkward or oh my<br>relationships going pear-shaped what<br>does this mean so it's a really fun<br>class it is taught at 8 a.m.<br>I'm not a morning person however after<br>doing a semester of it I've come to love<br>the 8:00 a.m. slot which I am sure you<br>all will - it is recorded as far as<br>assessments go 25% essay and a two-hour<br>open book exam which is 75% of the mark<br>so that's how it will be assessed any<br>questions on family property before I<br>hop on to privacy law no good okay<br>excellent so privacy law Steven pink and<br>I are going to co-teach privacy law<br>really looking forward to it it's going<br>to be a ten-point paper first semester<br>it's going to be taught in a two-hour<br>block once a week which is very<br>manageable bite-sized for you to all<br>digest privacy law is a really exciting<br>area and the reason privacy law is an<br>exciting area is because it is<br>constantly changing right<br>with technology privacy is becoming a<br>really big issue think about Facebook<br>right all of your information which is<br>on Facebook is it private is it not what<br>if you have a private profile think<br>about Edward Snowden right he had<br>private information all of a sudden he<br>starts leaking that private information<br>what does that mean okay<br>what about privacy and employment your<br>employer what about your health care<br>records what about broadcasting<br>Standards Authority what are the<br>competing interests so how the course is<br>going to be structured as Steven is<br>going to lecture you for six weeks he's<br>going to be talking to you about<br>concepts and definitions of privacy<br>competing interests as they relate to<br>privacy and he's also going to talk to<br>you about the common law development of<br>privacy because as you probably all know<br>from torts and your stage one class UK<br>Australia New Zealand Canada who I left<br>out Australia yep all have different<br>laws relating to privacy just to make it<br>really complex so we're going to talk<br>about all the different approaches to<br>those and then I will come in for the<br>second six weeks and I will be talking<br>about the Privacy Act what it covers<br>what you need to know and then we'll be<br>talking about specific<br>studies so I will be going through stuff<br>like broadcasting Standards Authority<br>one of the media have to do when they're<br>reporting on things are their privacy<br>requirements that have to be met I'll be<br>talking about privacy and employment law<br>for example privacy with your healthcare<br>records and I'll also be doing a really<br>cool topic I'm looking forward to called<br>the right to be forgotten okay it's this<br>new interest in privacy so given<br>technology if you were to pass away or<br>have a family member who passes away<br>they are going to leave an electronic<br>footprint right on Facebook for example<br>well what happens if you want to be<br>forgotten right think about the Tucker<br>case criminal conviction okay the right<br>to be forgotten who's to say with a<br>clean slate act that after a certain<br>period of time that criminal record<br>should be forgotten but of course with<br>media now all you have to do is a quick<br>google search and that's going to be<br>stuck with them forever right so we're<br>gonna be talking about all of those<br>interesting things what is really really<br>great about this course so I haven't<br>already sold it to you that despite the<br>fact that Steven and I are teaching it<br>is the assessments so we're going to<br>have a 1000 word 20% essay but the cool<br>thing with this is there are three<br>different topics due at three different<br>times in the semester you get to choose<br>amazing okay that's very exciting the<br>other really exciting thing about this<br>class is that eighty percent it's an<br>option as well you can either do a<br>two-hour open book exam or a pilo paper<br>and luuv exam which is four thousand<br>words and you can choose the topic of<br>your choice to be approved by us<br>okay and that's neat too because you're<br>kind of killing two birds with one stone<br>you have to do an extended piece of<br>writing a four thousand words for law<br>for ninety nine second four nine eight<br>sorry law for nine eight you required<br>for your degree to do an extended piece<br>of writing a four thousand words if you<br>choose to do that in our class not only<br>will that be your final assessment but<br>as I said you're killing two birds with<br>one stone because you take that 4-9-8<br>box and you get to really delve into an<br>area of privacy that you're interested<br>in<br>everyone can recall story that we're all<br>covers a sticks to do with parenting and<br>the dissolution of marriage it covers<br>all the non-financial aspects of family<br>property of course covers or<br>relationship material so why should you<br>do family law for two reasons one is for<br>professional reasons the other is for<br>personal reasons our family law is a<br>major area of practice if you end up<br>working in a suburban third or even work<br>the poorer don't kick a large firm in<br>the city invariably you will encounter<br>common law it is a great amount of<br>subject that you really should be aware<br>of in regards to the second point of<br>personal reasons unfortunately parent<br>disputes and the dissolution of<br>relationships are ubiquitous in society<br>so if you're ever at parties or talking<br>to your friends they find out that your<br>lawyer they might ask you for advice now<br>anyway in terms of the content murder<br>top products that will cover include<br>marriage and divorce value justice<br>system alternative dispute resolution in<br>family law a child loss that colors<br>adoption surrogacy and something known<br>as a doctrine of ensure a minor and<br>finally we'll go through parenting the<br>scripts are both domestic and<br>international disputes domestic disputes<br>of color on the care of children act<br>while the international disputes are<br>covered<br>even are under the care of children at<br>or through the Hague Convention on some<br>aspects of child abduction so there is<br>both the domestic and international I<br>mentioned true the family law of course<br>in terms of the assessment there are two<br>pieces of assessable family law there is<br>1,500 words silent which is worth 20%<br>and two-hour exam and it's worth 80<br>percent it will be taught in semester 1<br>next year will be taught on Mondays and<br>Thursdays Mondays 24 and 6 p.m. and<br>Thursdays between 4 &amp; 5 here does anyone<br>have any questions in relation to hello<br>everyone nice to see you here not put<br>that there I'm Nina curry I teach and<br>research in dispute resolution both<br>theory and practice with a focus on<br>mediation mediation for those of you who<br>don't know it's not meditation that's<br>not medication I still get that the<br>whole time it's a process for resolving<br>disputes out of course and basically<br>what it involves is getting around the<br>table face to face talking about the<br>problem and negotiating a solution by<br>agreement and all civil cases can be<br>resolved by agreement legally can be<br>resolved by agreement without the need<br>to go to trial so it's always available<br>to the parties to resolve their disputes<br>by agreement<br>we call that settling the case and every<br>case every civil case you read in law<br>school whether it be in torts or<br>contract or equity is a case that didn't<br>settle okay so if I tell you that over<br>90 percent of all cases filed in the New<br>Zealand High Court settle before trial<br>what does that tell you about the cases<br>that actually result in a judgment for<br>you to read at law school what it should<br>tell you is that it's only this much<br>okay what actually happens in practice<br>is everything else so my proposition and<br>why I really enjoy teaching this subject<br>is there as a lawyer and actually in<br>other contexts as well I have lots of<br>former students who are now doing<br>practicing law in a non dispute context<br>are particularly in commercial law and<br>actually in non legal contexts and<br>management consulting and all sorts of<br>other industries is there<br>actually there's a whole range of skills<br>you need outside of mooting and<br>courtroom advocacy so how most disputes<br>resolved not in court what skills do you<br>need as a lawyer you need skills in<br>conflict diagnosis you need skills in<br>effective communication skills in<br>negotiation theory okay and you also<br>need to be thinking about or what we<br>talked about in this course is the wider<br>civil justice picture<br>it's a fundamentally different ballgame<br>in the negotiation and mediation context<br>to represent your clients effectively<br>it's a whole different set of skills so<br>that's what this course is all about<br>getting to grips with those skills both<br>the underlying theory of negotiation and<br>conflict but also the wider<br>jurisprudential civil justice context<br>and also practical clinical skills so<br>switching to and I should have said in<br>terms of Who I am I'm a member of<br>faculty here I also practice as a<br>mediator so I bring that professional<br>practice to bear on what we talk about<br>in the classroom and you'll hear a lot<br>of war stories and so on who should do<br>this course across a wide range of<br>practice areas basically anyone who's<br>thinking of going into litigation I<br>would suggest that along with evidence<br>the other course I teach this is bread<br>and butter stuff you need to do it if<br>you're looking at going into a family<br>law employment law even if you're<br>looking at practicing in criminal law<br>these kind of skills come up in the plea<br>bargaining context increasingly in the<br>restorative justice context and in<br>commercial law we're looking at<br>negotiation skills for deal making what<br>do we actually do than make the course<br>as a mix of I try and divide it into 50%<br>Theory 50% practice and that carries<br>through both into the way that I teach<br>the course and into the way that we<br>assess the course we have a limited<br>entry we most years we have a waiting<br>list because we have an element of<br>practical clinical experience in it<br>which means that we simply cannot have<br>the assessment as I said 50/50 theory<br>and practice will half of it will be a<br>research essay due at the end which will<br>be the theory component of it there is a<br>research exercise I can't remember the<br>exact word limit it will be in the<br>handbook and due course but that is a<br>very academic side of it the rest is<br>more practical so we'll be doing<br>negotiation exercises in class we're<br>part of the assessment is preparing for<br>that exercise and then reflecting on how<br>it went from a negotiation theory point<br>of view there will also be an element of<br>group work in past years that's been a<br>group presentation on a specific topic<br>like gender dynamics and negotiation or<br>online dispute resolution I'm in the<br>process of reviewing that at the moment<br>it's possible we'll do some sort of<br>online blogging type of exercise so<br>watch the space that will be confirmed<br>in the handbook it's not it's all<br>internal eAssist no exam the feedback<br>I've had in past years is that people<br>thought that would be easy and it turned<br>out to be harder ok so it's not a soft<br>option the other feedback I've got<br>consistently is that it's one of the<br>best courses they've ever taken so take<br>from that what you will in terms of my<br>teaching style I like to run it as a<br>postgraduate workshop so we've got a<br>small class there will be a<br>participation component the expectation<br>is that you get involved you engage I<br>know your name<br>this is the final year of law school<br>stuff it's a chance for you to bring<br>something to the table as well and<br>engage at a higher level questions<br>it just says something about the<br>timetable we've scheduled at two<br>morning's a week total of four hours<br>okay and we have it on I think Mondays<br>and Tuesdays and Thursdays 11th 9 to 11<br>Monday and Thursday 9:00 till 11:00 yes<br>thanks there are four hours allocated<br>but it's a 15-point course that gives us<br>flexibility for the practical exercises<br>okay so we will not always go for the<br>full two hours every class what it means<br>is that we can chop and change and I<br>know that you've got that time set aside<br>the assessment is calibrated to reflect<br>a 15-point of course okay hello<br>everybody as Steven just said I'm a<br>barrister at the moment I've been a<br>practicing lawyer for 20 odd years and<br>I'm replacing rod Joyce in the Civil<br>Procedure elective that means it will be<br>a new course next year with a new<br>teacher who's I hope going to bring a<br>bit of a different perspective to the<br>course and I don't mean that in a<br>critical way I've spoken to a few people<br>at chambers who frankly said to me they<br>didn't do Civil Procedure because they<br>thought it was a bit dry I then asked<br>them if their experiences at chambers<br>since then might see them reflecting on<br>that decision in a more critical way and<br>universally all of them have said yes<br>that tells you something about what you<br>might expect to live in because Civil<br>Procedure fundamentally is an immensely<br>practical course that will ground you in<br>good skills if you are intending to<br>enter a civil litigation type practice<br>I'm<br>intending to make the course partly a<br>practical course in the sense that I<br>will be teaching you what the high court<br>will say and I will be explaining to you<br>from a really sort of how to do it point<br>of view how you go about navigating what<br>is a large piece of work that tells you<br>because it's just a collection of rules<br>how you run a piece of civil litigation<br>this is the stuff that will be the 10%<br>Nina won't deal with so it's the stuff<br>that goes to court it also frequently<br>involves the 90% of stuff that does<br>settle because invariably a lot of those<br>disputes have needed a court proceeding<br>to kick it all off so I'll give you the<br>skills to be able to confidently and<br>competently draft a pleading document<br>which is a document that settles we'll<br>call it what your claim is you will come<br>away from my course knowing exactly what<br>an injunction or a freezing water is and<br>why you might want to get those things<br>and how you might want to go about doing<br>them it's not just the practical side<br>that I want to look at though I've<br>failed if you come away just knowing a<br>bunch of rules I've succeeded if you<br>come away knowing why those rules exist<br>and were the confidence to be able to<br>apply the knowledge you've learned about<br>general Civil Procedure rules into other<br>areas where similar procedures are<br>needed<br>fundamentally Civil Procedure is about<br>natural justice and about ensuring that<br>the parties in the court know what case<br>is being argued and can argue fully and<br>properly informed about all the facts<br>the High Court rules is an extremely<br>long piece of work I don't believe it<br>needs to be that long and what I'd like<br>you all if you did my course to<br>understand as an outcome of that is<br>what's wrong with those rules as well as<br>what's right with them there are many<br>different ways in which a civil<br>procedure or a set of procedural rules<br>applies in new zealand not just the high<br>rules and their many simple ways in<br>which basic procedures are deployed so<br>if you approach the course the right way<br>not only would you come out with<br>practical skills but you'll have some<br>reasoning and critical thinking skills<br>that will enable you to confidently look<br>at any procedure and say well I know<br>it's written a bit differently from the<br>stuff I learned but fundamentally it's<br>trying to achieve this purpose finally<br>there's a bunch of new things have been<br>happening over the last few years in<br>relation to civil litigation actions<br>you'd have read about a number of them<br>in the newspapers and things they're<br>interesting developments of Civil<br>Procedure and the way in which new<br>zealand civil procedures is growing i'm<br>talking about things like class actions<br>and litigation and funding if you're at<br>all aware of the things that are<br>happening in new zealand you will see<br>more and more of these things happening<br>and there are rules that are slowly<br>being brought into place that tell us<br>how we need to deal with those sorts of<br>things so by class action I mean the<br>kiwifruit guards for example are<br>involved in a big lawsuit in the High<br>Court in Wellington at the moment where<br>they are saying that the government<br>failed them in the government's<br>obligations to keep PSA out of New<br>Zealand you have a large group hundreds<br>of people who all say they've suffered<br>losses so we have rules around how they<br>can have their day in court but only one<br>day in court because they were all<br>basically like the same as<br>litigation and funding is increasingly<br>relevant because litigation is expensive<br>and people can make money at all funding<br>litigation and in New Zealand there are<br>now a number of established companies<br>that offer litigation funding options<br>for people to enable their case to go to<br>them and you'd have probably read about<br>a lot of the some James Hardy actions at<br>the moment where people are suing James<br>Hardy and a number of other producers of<br>housing products for defective products<br>that end up on their houses that mean<br>there has is leaking so it's exciting<br>little area I'm not going to make it a<br>dry area I don't really like standing up<br>in front of the lectern<br>but like Nina I'm not sure how many<br>people going to enroll but we'll adapt I<br>think the course to make sure that<br>practical exercises are assessed<br>in a practical way so there's no point<br>in examining people on practical<br>exercises there is a point in examining<br>people on conceptual understandings of<br>putting my head - how we're going to<br>assess the course and you'll have to<br>wait to the handbook to see that but my<br>own style is very much like getting out<br>from behind the lectern participating<br>with people getting group collaborative<br>things going and that's an increasingly<br>important skill that I think you'll find<br>in practice working as a team so the PSA<br>litigation is a great example it needs a<br>lot of lawyers to run a big case like<br>that so there's no scope for an<br>individual there you have to know how to<br>work with a team a team of people to get<br>the vast amount of information before<br>the court and the key here in a way so I<br>hopefully I'll teach you some of those<br>skills as well I'm quite looking forward<br>to starting this paper a bit from<br>scratch although judge Joyce is my<br>neighbor so I'm going to sit down with<br>him and ask him what worked about the<br>way he taught it and what didn't sir<br>question is hi Nina you can if you like<br>Jenna take us back why wouldn't it that<br>would take us back a long time yeah Nina<br>was reused for you a student it makes me<br>sound really older not that old I was a<br>Russell McVeigh when Nina I think first<br>surfaced their wiki sir<br>yeah I mean just a general comment from<br>me you've evidence if you were gonna<br>think about if I'm gonna be a civil<br>litigator and I'm not saying you should<br>make your decision about that now but if<br>that's really where you're heading there<br>are really some core topics Mena's is<br>one absolutely because 90% of cases<br>settle so you need to know how to settle<br>them and how to do the mediation and<br>stuff for those that don't settle or to<br>get them to the point of settlement you<br>might need to know a bunch of that Civil<br>Procedure now a good question to ask me<br>might be well one I learned that at<br>profs and if I don't learn it at profs<br>what about learning that on the job I<br>didn't study Civil Procedure when I went<br>to a university I don't even think it<br>was offered when I was doing it and I<br>the feedback I get from the juniors it<br>changes now because part of the job<br>they're given all the time has read the<br>rules and figure it out and come back to<br>me with what we do here they're actually<br>having to spend a lot of time now<br>learning things that could have been<br>taught and if they were taught they<br>probably would do better no disrespect<br>to profs but it's a pretty basic course<br>that won't get into the depth of the<br>things that I want to get into and won't<br>give you the skills that you need I'm<br>selling it but that's the reality I've<br>been in practice for 25 years I've been<br>frustrated by employed junior lawyers<br>that don't know the rules and what I've<br>said to them we need to get an<br>injunction quick get the paperwork<br>together and I get a blank look because<br>they don't know that they need an<br>undertaking as to damages and they don't<br>know they need to get some information<br>from the client about their ability to<br>play an award of damages if the<br>undertakings call it causes great<br>frustration if you want to leg up in<br>terms of a future employer being able to<br>walk confidently into a partner's office<br>and say that looks like a summary<br>judgment application to me can I do it<br>we'll get you miles ahead of the person<br>that sits there blankly and goes I don't<br>know what do we do what's the procedure<br>here alright hello to all of you here<br>so I teach evidence of Criminal<br>Procedure Scott optic an associate<br>professor evidence is also taught by<br>Nina quarry who was just here I teach in<br>the first semester nina teaches in the<br>second semester evidence is about the<br>study of how you prove things in court<br>in civil and criminal cases it's a basic<br>standard survey class<br>based on the evidence act 2006 we cover<br>hearsay privileged opinion relevance<br>prejudice eligibility compel ability<br>opinion evidence etc all the basics of<br>the law of evidence it's a course that<br>is definitely useful and important for<br>anybody who thinks they might be a<br>litigator or might do any kind of trial<br>or courtroom work because the rules of<br>evidence or governs how you prove things<br>in court like I said we do cover both<br>those that cover both civil and criminal<br>cases however most of the cases are sort<br>of done out of the criminal jurisdiction<br>for various reasons because that's where<br>a lot of evidence law gets made it is a<br>like I said a survey class a high level<br>of class participation a reasonable<br>amount of reading and statutory<br>references are strictly to the evidence<br>act itself all the materials are<br>produced in-house the only thing you<br>really would need otherwise is a copy of<br>the act and then if you want some<br>outside reference my own book on the<br>Evidence Act which is currently being<br>updated to its fourth edition<br>so like I said it is a good case for<br>anybody thinking about any kind of trial<br>work in your future litigation civil war<br>war criminals assessment wise it's a<br>standard through our final exam for a<br>four hour a week class and there's a<br>written assignment components as well<br>that written assignment component can<br>change depending on who's teaching unit<br>so we want to do but it's an opinion<br>like question so that's basically<br>evidence and we are going to try to<br>equalize the numbers between the streams<br>right so next year it's a very popular<br>class many many people who are in their<br>final year take it particularly and so<br>we're going to try to equalize the<br>numbers between the streams and we<br>expect pretty full classes in in both<br>semesters any questions about any of<br>there are you I mean well there's no<br>co-requisites for evidence I don't know<br>is there as evidence is evidence of<br>prerequisite for advocacy not as axilla<br>yes correct yeah it's a correct yeah<br>so you can do advocacy without sort of<br>derivatives with advocacy yeah no<br>question that's right yeah that's that's<br>what it's that's what it's been that's<br>what it's been in the past<br>yeah all right anybody else okay so then<br>moving on to Criminal Procedure so<br>Criminal Procedure is essentially the<br>rules that govern the investigation and<br>detection of criminal offenses and the<br>prosecution of criminal offences so it's<br>kind of like the rules of the game for<br>what the cops can do and can't do to<br>investigate crime and then the rules of<br>the game for how criminal trials are<br>conducted it's different than evidence<br>because evidence is how evidence is<br>presented<br>whereas Criminal Procedure is strictly<br>limited through criminal jurisdiction<br>evidence is both criminal and civil and<br>criminal procedure is about at the first<br>instance search and seizure police<br>questioning powers police powers to<br>require documents the exclusion of<br>illegally obtained evidence the right to<br>silence the right to counsel all the<br>kind of stuff you see on television when<br>police investigate crimes and so the two<br>thirds of the class is learning the<br>rules that govern how police can<br>investigate crimes or not that basically<br>involves the Bill of Rights Act which<br>largely sets out the most important<br>aspects of Criminal Procedure and is<br>Ellen the right suspect tab when you're<br>arrested or suspected of criminal<br>offending and it also involves a Search<br>and Surveillance Act and also parts of<br>the Evidence Act so like I said about<br>two-thirds of the class is devoted to<br>that the last third of the class is<br>devoted to criminal adjudication and<br>criminal adjudication is essentially the<br>rules that govern criminal trials so<br>your right to cross-examine witnesses<br>your right to be present and present a<br>defense jury selection excessive<br>pretrial publicity change of<br>you you know all that all that sort of<br>stuff as well so Criminal Procedure is<br>would be a class for one of two kinds of<br>people and again it's a reasonable-sized<br>class it's going to be taught in the<br>second semester and it's for one of two<br>types of people if you're just<br>interested in taking one criminal<br>justice or criminal related class out of<br>interest you might like this one<br>because it does deal with a lot of stuff<br>that you may be familiar with from you<br>know movies and television or just sort<br>of walking around the halogen criminal<br>justice matters but if you definitely<br>should take it if you're thinking about<br>becoming the prosecutor or defense alert<br>so if you're getting into any kind of<br>prosecution or defense work what you<br>learn in this class is really would be<br>very very important to how you would<br>conduct cases on either side so learning<br>the rules of crimper are important to<br>anybody going into that business so I<br>think it would be good for either of<br>those for those sorts of couple words<br>again it's a three hour week class one<br>one hour lecture one two hour lecture<br>it's a standard-issue spotter exam you<br>know at the end with an opinion sort of<br>piece of written work component as part<br>of it nothing to buy except for the<br>stack to the critical status which you<br>can download the Evidence Act<br>Surveillance Act bill of rights Criminal<br>Procedure Act the rest of the materials<br>are produced by me in house involving<br>all sorts of criminal investigation and<br>Jude occation cases from the courts up<br>to an including the Supreme Court which<br>has been very much involved in fraud as<br>business lately<br>that's it any questions about any of<br>that I have a question for ya we've just<br>heard from Julian long he's going to be<br>teaching Civil Procedure yeah and you<br>say something about the relationship of<br>physicals to a Criminal Procedure and<br>where the students should do one or the<br>other pretty much pretty much no<br>relation at all I mean Civil Procedure<br>protective in law school and really life<br>is really about how the rules that<br>govern the conduct of civil cases and<br>again you want to distinguish it from<br>evidence because evidence is the rules<br>that govern the presentation of proof in<br>civil and criminal cases so the way you<br>present proof and the way you conduct<br>trials there is some overlap but they<br>can be two different things a Civil<br>Procedure is largely all the processes<br>that take place in the context of civil<br>litigation largely governed by the High<br>Court rules and also by overlap with the<br>Evidence Act<br>whereas Criminal Procedure really is<br>about things that happen before trial<br>which is the rules that govern how<br>police actually investigate criminal<br>offenses up to the point of arrest and<br>then the last third of the class<br>criminal adjudication is the rules that<br>govern the conduct of criminal trials<br>once someone has been brought into the<br>system so the main difference is it<br>focuses only on criminal jurisdiction<br>and its scope extends more broadly<br>outside just at raw contacts to the<br>actual investigative phase context which<br>involves many of the things you would<br>have heard of search and seizure police<br>questioning the right to silence the<br>right to wear that sort of thing so<br>competition or first okay the cause for<br>competition law is a standard sort of<br>compositional course or what the<br>Americans would call antitrust course<br>and we focus on the Commerce Act and<br>particularly really sort of parts two<br>and three so the sort of conduct that<br>sort of gets caught up as mergers and<br>acquisitions that will lessen<br>competition so there's been quite a lot<br>of media coverage this week about the<br>Fairfax NZD enamine merger as well for<br>instance the idea that the two newspaper<br>groups in New Zealand with two major<br>websites news websites would potentially<br>merge to get<br>eliminate competition the question is<br>when does competition elimination when<br>does they breach the act and also in<br>this particular case is there some sort<br>of public benefit that may sort of<br>justify this particular merger going<br>ahead as well so this is we litigated in<br>the High Court this week so obviously<br>there's some mergers and acquisitions of<br>one of the key things also what's<br>important is lots of sorts of contact<br>that can bridge the exo price-fixing<br>various other sorts of arrangements<br>joint ventures sometimes these can<br>lessen competition between competitors<br>reducing sort of consumer welfare the<br>benefits to consumers that they expect<br>from competition also sort of them<br>taking advantage of market power you<br>have large corporations that have a sort<br>of a dominant position on a market and<br>by engaging in so variety from<br>competition or compared to competitive X<br>maybe be able to eliminate sort of<br>particular competitors smaller firms<br>from the market as well okay so it's a<br>standard sort of competition or<br>antitrust course the logic behind the<br>course and the structure of the thinking<br>it's is quite similar act is based on<br>Australian law but also this stuff the<br>law in the UK and the US and and the EU<br>all quite similar more based on a lot of<br>similar thinking and understandings<br>competition law we tend to sort of take<br>a sort of more of a policy perspective<br>to that as well we're thinking about<br>some of the economics and the arguments<br>behind particular provisions and when<br>they're likely to be breached as well<br>and it really reflects house of<br>competition or cases of litigation in<br>practice<br>my second topic so please ask if you<br>have any questions my second topic is<br>postgraduate sort of courses for<br>undergraduate students so every year we<br>open up one or two several sort of off<br>the postgraduate courses for<br>undergraduate students this tends to be<br>serve only final year undergraduate<br>students are allowed to do postgraduate<br>courses and which enric choose courses<br>that there isn't an equivalent at the<br>undergraduate level and that we think<br>students may have some particular<br>interest in doing it particular course<br>so the postgraduate courses are<br>sometimes they taught a little bit<br>differently from the undergraduate<br>courses a lot of our courses are taught<br>on our intensive basis and they may be<br>taught sort of for five days for six or<br>seven hours a day so the course the<br>actual lecture time is jammed into a<br>short period of time some of the courses<br>are taught so throughout the semester<br>typically if they taught throughout the<br>semester they're taught one day a week<br>so between 5:00 and 8:00 p.m. so quite a<br>different sort of timetable from the<br>undergraduate courses the assessment is<br>also quite different as well whereas<br>your typical undergraduate course<br>assignments and a final exam<br>particularly the electors when it comes<br>to the postgraduate courses there are no<br>exams<br>assessment is all based on sort of<br>research papers almost entirely based on<br>research papers and so we have courses<br>that are 15 points and thirty point<br>courses so the fifteen point course is<br>typically involved writing a<br>approximately six and a half thousand<br>words of research essay the 30 point<br>course is involved writing a twelve and<br>a half thousand researchers so it's a<br>different set of skills so possibly if<br>you're if you're not enrolled in a sort<br>of an honours dissertation on a seminar<br>you may not get an opportunity to write<br>a long piece of work or well engagement<br>piece of detailed research work so maybe<br>there is some sort of interest in you<br>doing so as well something some<br>particular topic you wish to explore yes<br>we've got yeah so I guess some this it's<br>far as sort of who would be suitable for<br>doing these particular courses we tend<br>to sort of um set the entry criteria so<br>that only students in their final years<br>having completed part three able to do<br>the postgraduate courses it's part of<br>your undergraduate degree there also<br>tends to be so the DPA cattle for five<br>as well so you need to be performing<br>reasonably well in parts two and three<br>before we will allow you to do though<br>is it difficult and no students who tend<br>to do it tend to super form just as well<br>if not better than they do and there are<br>undergraduate courses as well so by the<br>time because we were only focusing on<br>students in the last year people have<br>had the experience of writing and<br>research and so they had the skills<br>necessary to perform quite well in in<br>so there will be a list that sort of<br>posted up on field shortly a lot of<br>courses so number of our courses are<br>taught particularly the intensive<br>they're taught pies and visitors so<br>people who not necessary based at the<br>University of Auckland so probably about<br>a third of our course are taught by<br>versus people come from other parts of<br>the world from Oxford all sorts of<br>places there so you may be interested in<br>sitting so we have quite a range of sort<br>of international sort of people who<br>teach on the particular program as well<br>so I I don't know if it's any particular<br>useful interests but I'll read you the<br>list of topics we've got um we've<br>identified that may be of interest to<br>you as well and if they have a copy<br>these were not choice of typos in it but<br>yes let's jump that's postgraduate<br>courses what about your students if<br>you've got any questions please feel<br>free to ask me or come see everybody i'm<br>caroline foster married with two<br>children no pets which is subject a<br>great dispute in our household and I'm<br>working on the kids side of things so<br>I'm talking with you about two courses<br>today the first of those is public<br>international law so there is the law<br>between countries if you like between<br>States and these this 20 point course<br>which ones in the first semester is an<br>introduction to how international law<br>works into all of the most important and<br>basic aspects of that legal system we<br>can call it so if you're going on in<br>about any legal system you learn about<br>what the sources of law work we start<br>with that you need to know about who the<br>actors in your legal system are<br>primarily here at states or countries we<br>look at what we call the the subjects of<br>international law then we study the<br>topic of personality and international<br>law and then we look at that the powers<br>of these of these states often in the<br>form of the exercise of jurisdiction and<br>then we look at what happens if they<br>break international law we look at<br>what's known as responsibility in<br>international law okay so these are the<br>core elements of any international law<br>or course that you would study in in any<br>country we then go on and we start to<br>get a little bit more into this kind of<br>compliance side of things and dispute<br>settlement and we're not watch<br>international courts and tribunals do<br>and then we get into having learnt the<br>basic structural mechanisms of how<br>international law works the the<br>substantive area of the use of force and<br>international law so we start with<br>collective security we look at the way<br>that the UN system operates and then we<br>we look at some of the current quite<br>hope high-profile examples of<br>international conflict in<br>war with particular reference to what is<br>happened in Iraq over the last decade a<br>little more than that now<br>Afghanistan Syria and at this time we<br>was a look at Ukraine in the Russian<br>presence and Ukraine so this isn't this<br>isn't just for people who want to go and<br>practice international law it's<br>important that it's many of the<br>graduates of our law degrees as possible<br>have a good understanding of how<br>international law works it's so much a<br>part of the world that we live in now<br>but it isn't a speech be helpful course<br>if you did want to go and look at how<br>you might engage in this kind of area in<br>practice working for government would be<br>the main way to do that in my case I<br>worked for foreign affairs and trade for<br>low but under a decade after I got my<br>law degrees and then there are<br>international organizations and<br>non-governmental organizations and<br>there's a little bit of private practice<br>in these areas as well it's also a great<br>area for for postgraduate work if there<br>is something that you think you might be<br>attracted to lots of great and<br>interesting and important topics for the<br>world to address purpose if I talk about<br>advancing the interests of these a<br>moment see there's any questions so<br>Advanced International is running in the<br>second semester of next year you have to<br>have done international law before you<br>do advanced international law we welcome<br>international students in this course<br>but just a little caveat that we need a<br>reasonably high level of English<br>conversational ability for the Advanced<br>Course is quite a class discussion and<br>the aim of the advanced courses to<br>extend people's knowledge and skills in<br>international law both on the conceptual<br>side thinking about concepts like<br>sovereignty and in terms of policy based<br>reasoning and analysis of the type that<br>you would in<br>discover and practice so the material is<br>quite advanced it's designed to be a<br>more challenging course and there's a<br>real emphasis on student commitment to<br>reading as a participation in class and<br>in what students will come away with<br>will be you know an enhanced level of<br>skills in this field will be useful for<br>seeking employment could be useful for<br>further research and study<br>it'll also introduce you to<br>intersections between subfields of<br>international law so you have a chance<br>to get a bit more of an overview of the<br>fit that out there in the world of<br>international law it's not all about<br>fighting and bombs or even peace for<br>that matter but you know we have the<br>whole field of trade law of investment<br>law Barbara mentor law of law of the sea<br>as my colleague Vincent is going to<br>discuss with you and of Human Rights<br>tour and also their international law at<br>the end of the day is had actually all<br>about States and governments<br>increasingly the role of private actors<br>and companies is taking is taking a step<br>to the fore so we'll look at it how<br>business business fits into<br>international law these days and then<br>they're all anchored and concrete<br>studies so we take specific case studies<br>like tourism and Antarctica climate<br>change in investment in renewable energy<br>projects trade bans on harmful products<br>like cigarettes exploitation of by<br>organisms are in in such like so it's a<br>more demanding course in torsion of<br>slightly different different formation<br>yes of course I can so thank you it's<br>right let's say if you look at the<br>assessment spreadsheet you'll see an<br>international or appears for both your<br>semester and sentence miss but that's no<br>longer correct so international spear<br>semester only what does the missing from<br>here for the second semesters advanced<br>international because it's only recently<br>into the picture but the timetable is<br>created yes<br>so the assessment for international or<br>which is in the first semester is a test<br>which is an hour and is likely to be an<br>essay question on which you think it<br>feedback and an examination which would<br>be two hours okay the assessment for the<br>advanced international law course is a<br>little different reflecting the greater<br>emphasis on participation although we<br>also expect that in international law it<br>includes a participation component<br>expected to be probably of ten percent<br>noticed but some written assignments<br>which will be fairly short of probably<br>with something like 10 percent of the<br>mark in the in an examination which<br>should be with a remainder of the mark<br>no questions yeah that's correct you<br>yep it's h2o politics and human rights<br>so we as well that's an alternative<br>events for students who are doing okay I<br>don't throw my heat yeah they're both<br>twenty points so they're both for<br>contact hours a week I don't be taught<br>in two groups up two hours so you come<br>to class twice but you stay for two<br>hours each time in me too I do that too<br>mmm well last you look you but how<br>pretty not least good afternoon<br>everybody<br>so my name is Vincent karate burns I'm a<br>newly appointed associate professor here<br>at the law school and next year will<br>offer an elective on the law of the sea<br>so what is the law of the sea well the<br>law of the sea basically is the public<br>law of the oceans in fact it's more than<br>that it is an international public law<br>of the oceans so in a sense it is a<br>subcategory especially specialized<br>category of public international law so<br>what we will investigate in the course<br>is well what are the main rules that<br>nations have designed among themselves<br>for the peaceful public regulation of<br>the principle uses of the oceans such as<br>navigation I'm sure you've all heard of<br>the terms high seas perhaps territorial<br>sea well we will determine what these<br>terms what these notions encompass from<br>a legal perspective access to resources<br>is also a major concern of the law of<br>the sea not just fisheries but mineral<br>resources and other forms of biology<br>biological resources and so on and so<br>forth and in fact we do have a treaty on<br>all these questions very large treaty in<br>fact it's called the United Nations<br>Convention<br>of the sea around which the course is<br>built so I think it's a fascinating<br>topic<br>it's a fascinating course I think to<br>take not just because the oceans cover<br>more than 70% of the planet not just<br>because more than ninety percent of<br>world trade is carried by sea but also<br>because of the great variety of problems<br>that we face in a lot of the sea I'm<br>sure you've all heard of the problems in<br>the South China Sea nowadays in the<br>South China Sea yes I'm sure you've all<br>heard of piracy off the coast of Africa<br>of the coast of Southeast Asia I'm sure<br>you've all heard of instances of a<br>nation arresting and boarding the ship<br>of another nation to control the nature<br>of the cargo aboard well all these<br>questions are determined in law by a<br>branch of science called the law of the<br>sea so I think at the end of the day<br>what the course aims to do is to give<br>you an understanding of these main<br>principles governing the law of the sea<br>the use of the oceans but also the<br>reasons the motivations behind those<br>rules and we will look at them in their<br>historical in their international but<br>also in their regional perspective I<br>think the course could be a great course<br>to take for those who intend to pursue a<br>career perhaps in diplomacy oceans<br>management maritime affairs but much<br>more broadly for all those who have an<br>interest in in the oceans and the<br>assessment there will be two pieces of<br>assessment one is a research essay and<br>the other piece of assessment is a final<br>exam<br>in class so I think that my course<br>really focuses on the public aspect of<br>the use of the oceans whereas maritime<br>law is well basically more commercial<br>law so would be classified more as<br>private law I my course is really a sub<br>a subset of public international law so<br>we won't deal with things like charter<br>parties and and this is really for<br>maritime law is there any questions no<br>thank you thank you very much yes so<br>you'll see that we skipped over<br>Joanna manning health care law Joe can't<br>be here but she's asked me to just make<br>a few points on her behalf so I'll just<br>speak to that course briefly health care<br>law is code taught by Professor Joe<br>Joanna Manning and some of you will know<br>from torts all of you will probably know<br>from torts and professor Ron Peterson<br>who was for a decade or so the health<br>and disability commissioner the second<br>health and disability commissioner in<br>New Zealand so this year the teaching of<br>the course and the course is looking at<br>a variety of issues different areas of<br>the law with that arise within the<br>health sector so the topics that Joe and<br>Ron proposed to cover next year and the<br>course will be in the first semester and<br>it's on Tuesday mornings 9:00 till 11:00<br>and Friday when two to three hours a<br>week these topics firstly the Cartwright<br>inquiry which was a major health scandal<br>in New Zealand and which made<br>recommendations that were later adopted<br>and made into law in New Zealand such as<br>the code of rights which was recommended<br>by the report after the<br>cartwright inquiry an introduction to<br>medical ethics and some case studies<br>other forms of accountability such as<br>the disciplinary process relating to<br>health professionals some specific<br>issues in medical negligence and ACC<br>treatment injury a key topic in the<br>course is consent to medical treatment<br>what does the law require for a valid<br>legally enforceable consent<br>what is competence and what is meant by<br>informed consent I'm following on from<br>that the teachers look at the<br>circumstances when it is lawful for a<br>health professional to provide treatment<br>to a patient who was unable to consent<br>it was not competent including medical<br>treatment provided to young children and<br>adolescence there's some consideration<br>of rationing of resources in the<br>healthcare context which is an ongoing<br>problem so some of the legal issues<br>associated with decisions about who gets<br>treatment as a priority and what the law<br>has to say about that issue of rationing<br>and the last topic in the course is to<br>do with the courts contribution to<br>assisted dying as a law reform issue so<br>the seamoth bill drawn out at the ballot<br>will come before the house the<br>circumstances in which it's lawful to<br>withdraw life-prolonging treatment such<br>as removing ventilators at the end of<br>life and the associated issues the<br>courses assessed by way of a compulsory<br>test a 30-minute test which contributes<br>20% of the final grade and then an<br>open-book exam at the end of the<br>semester for the other 80%<br>just coming back to where we started<br>those generic things there's just one<br>point I want to make in respect of the<br>honors seminars or in particular the<br>seminar that truss are done with will be<br>offering next year on international law<br>and that is that Caroline's<br>international law course which will be<br>offered in the first semester is a<br>co-requisite so if you are a prospective<br>honor student and you think that the<br>honors international law seminar is the<br>one that you might want to take next<br>year then just be aware that you need to<br>be concurrently enrolled in the first<br>semester in international law unless<br>you've already passed that course other<br>than that I have nothing else to<br>contribute but do you have any questions<br>or comments yes yes so there are three<br>possibilities for involvement with<br>community organizations the list of them<br>is a community law placement where you<br>spend 40 hours with the community<br>organization and you write a little<br>reflective report on the experience and<br>for those of you who would be enrolled<br>under law for 99 that can substitute for<br>one of the opinions that you otherwise<br>would write but aside from that there's<br>no academic credits associated with that<br>experience the Community Law Project<br>involves spending a couple of weeks or<br>equivalent so a minimum of 75 hours with<br>an approved community organization and<br>writing a 5,000 word report because this<br>is a 10-point course so there is 10<br>points of academic credit available for<br>the community project the community law<br>internship is just a step up from that<br>it carries 20 points it involves a<br>10,000 word report and it involves a<br>hundred and fifty hours with a community<br>organization now those community<br>organizations that you might be placed<br>with and on which or your experience of<br>which you write a report about are<br>typically in New Zealand but they don't<br>have to be so sometimes students might<br>be overseas let's say over the summer<br>and make arrangements to work with some<br>community organization reflect on that<br>experience and<br>tract credit as a result so 20 points<br>for the internship 10 points for the<br>project zero points but credit for an<br>opinion towards for $4.99 in respect of<br>the lesser community placements enough<br>information the Community Law internship<br>the Community Law Project and the<br>community law placements can be<br>organized at anytime that you can find a<br>community organization that's willing to<br>accommodate to give you a worthwhile<br>experience yeah so potentially all three<br>are available in summer school or and/or<br>for first semester and or second<br>semester anything else of a general<br>nature ok well the majority to a close<br>and thank you for your attendance and<br>your patience throughout something of a<br>marathon effort endurance</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
