be here and thanks for turning out at<br>your lunchtime I'm really grateful as<br>Vicki said I'm the acting director at<br>the Center for sustainability down in<br>Dunedin and one of my roles at the<br>moment is science lead for Project af8<br>and I'll spend quite a bit of time today<br>telling you a bit about what that<br>project is and what it's trying to<br>achieve so my background in this whole<br>area of earthquakes goes back about<br>twenty one years to when I was an<br>undergrad student and geology downloads<br>at Argo and I had the great pleasure of<br>working on a section of the Alpine Fault<br>for my honours dissertation so I found<br>myself over on the west coast in a<br>pretty remote part of the southwest and<br>mapping this this this thing which I<br>actually never saw the whole time I was<br>there because it's very deeply beneath<br>the heavily forested southwestern hills<br>and so it was an interesting experience<br>being out there observing you know<br>nature and the power of this Alpine<br>Fault so I knew quite a lot about the<br>potential for a future Alpine Fault<br>earthquake and I always wondered why no<br>one was really talking about it<br>everyone in geology was excited about<br>this thing but people in the real world<br>didn't seem to know much about it so it<br>became a bit of a fascination of mine<br>this whole idea of outreaching about the<br>Alpine Fault so quite a few years went<br>by I went I did a PhD not in fundamental<br>science but in Applied Science around<br>the potential for the Alpine Fault to<br>impact on tourism activity around the<br>southern alps so essentially I've<br>transitioned into social science but I<br>also do a lot of work around hazard to<br>impact assessments of earthquake and the<br>potential to impact on human<br>infrastructure and communities and<br>organizations so today I'm going to be<br>presenting on behalf of a team of<br>scientists involved in project day f8<br>and on behalf of colleagues from civil<br>defense and Emergency Management who are<br>our partners on project day f8 but<br>before I launch into there I'm going to<br>tell you a bit about the fundamental the<br>background science why are we worried<br>about the Alpine Fault so what we do<br>know is that we can't predict<br>earthquakes with any particular degree<br>of certainty but the Alpine Fault has<br>got this really special<br>history and prehistory going back many<br>thousands of years it's a very rare sort<br>of earthquake record that we have with<br>the Alpine Fault and I'll tell you a bit<br>more about that as we go but let's start<br>with the real basic so New Zealand is in<br>the very southern Pacific and we sit<br>across an active tectonic plate boundary<br>so we have the Australian plate and the<br>Pacific plate colliding and it's a very<br>complex situation and the northeast of<br>the North Island we have a subduction<br>zone diving down beneath with the<br>Pacific plate diving down beneath the<br>the North Island in southwest New<br>Zealand we had the opposite sense of<br>motion on a plate boundary on a<br>subduction zone and in between we have<br>the Alpine Fault a transform fault with<br>a degree of compression going on across<br>that fault as well which means that we<br>have the Southern Alps so three<br>different types of plate motion<br>occurring across one very complex plate<br>boundary and the Alpine Fault is a<br>startlingly linear and long a long fault<br>which goes over 800 kilometers down the<br>spine of the Southern Alps and at about<br>the rate that your toenails grow the the<br>Pacific plate is colliding with the<br>Australian plate and and pushing up the<br>output the Southern Alps but also<br>grinding those two plates past each<br>other now we've known about the Alpine<br>Fault for Oh about almost 70 years it<br>was discovered by a guy called Harold<br>Wellman back in the 1950s and he<br>realized after a huge amount of crazy<br>intrepid fieldwork around the west coast<br>that there were rock types in the sinful<br>land that were very well identical to<br>once it came up again in Northwest<br>Nelson and he did the mess and realize<br>that these two bits of rock wood or<br>tight rock types had at one point in<br>history been together and they had moved<br>more than 800 kilometers and though they<br>were being separated by all this<br>movement across the Alpine Fault and<br>that was an amazing discovery no one<br>actually believes them for quite a while<br>it took a while for people to believe<br>this kind of crazy science but<br>eventually the realization was at yes<br>this plate boundary is pushing rocks<br>against each other and they've moved for<br>more than almost a thousand kilometers<br>over many millions of years<br>so this is what the Alpine Fault looks<br>like on the ground this is the fault<br>exiting off the coast at Milford Sound<br>and as you can see it the heavily<br>forested part of the world you can see<br>the line going through the landscape but<br>when you're standing on the ground<br>you can't actually seem to see much of<br>that going on if I can tell you because<br>I've tried to find me our pine fault<br>myself but there is a really great place<br>to see the Alpine Fault and this is<br>Gaunt Creek just north of franz josef<br>near a small place called fat aurora and<br>this sort of looks like a sort of a<br>rocky rocky lands flirt with the land<br>slip face and that's exactly what it is<br>really sips you can see just the scale<br>here a couple of people down at the<br>bottom of this slip face for scale so<br>it's a very tall quite dominating<br>looking thing and this was taken back in<br>the 90s so it's changed quite a bit<br>since then but essentially what you're<br>looking at is rocks that have been<br>dragged up from 15 to 20 kilometers<br>depth they've turned a kind of green<br>color because they've been crushed and<br>pulverizes they've come up and they've<br>had water flow through them so they turn<br>the kind of green color and essentially<br>what you're seeing here is a plate<br>boundary right before your very eyes<br>you've got the Pacific plate over<br>thrusting the Australian plate so for a<br>geologist this place is really really<br>exciting so over the last sort of 20 or<br>30 years we've been piecing together the<br>the Paleo seismic history of the Alpine<br>Fault and back about six or seven years<br>ago there was an amazing discovery by<br>some colleagues of mine up at genus<br>science<br>Calvin Berryman Kate Clark and is - a<br>Cochrane so I'm presenting their science<br>with over the next couple of slides so<br>they went to a place called her curry<br>Creek which is right down late near Lake<br>mcaro<br>in Fiordland and what they were looking<br>for was a site which had a sedimentary<br>sequence and they essentially they found<br>exactly that so what you've got here is<br>a creek flowing out of the Southern Alps<br>this is flying out towards the west and<br>on a regular day it just flows across<br>the Alpine Fault business as usual but<br>when you have an Alpine Fault earthquake<br>there's movement across that fault and<br>at dams for Curry Creek so essentially<br>it flows out and gets dammed right up<br>against the fault so what happens then<br>is<br>the sediment that's coming out of the<br>Alps starts to accumulate and you find a<br>signature for an Alpine Fault event and<br>the amazing thing about the site was<br>that they found a sequence of these<br>deposits going back through many<br>thousands of years so it was almost like<br>a geologist as a surfer surfing that<br>perfect way this was the most exciting<br>discovery for a geologist so essentially<br>as I said you see an accumulation of<br>sediment going back through time so you<br>get these layers with stripes of rock<br>and when you share it around on those<br>what's a sediment you can find dateable<br>material carbon or wood or leaves or<br>diatoms these are pollens things like<br>that which allows you to date the the<br>timing of these past events so prior to<br>the discovery at Hickory Creek and<br>another site at John O'Groats which is a<br>bit further south this is what we knew<br>about past Alpine Fault earthquakes so<br>that each of those little blue dots is a<br>past earthquake going back in time over<br>8,000 years when they discovered so this<br>is what we knew before when they<br>discovered the Hickory Creek and John<br>O'Groats sequences at took our knowledge<br>back 8,000 years with evidence of 27.4<br>earthquakes going back over time so each<br>of these little curves shows us sort of<br>a uncertainty in the date but as you can<br>see there's a huge amount of regularity<br>of these events going back in time so<br>what we have here is a long history of<br>large earthquakes on the Alpine Fault<br>it's remarkably regular this is unlike<br>any earthquake sequence anywhere in the<br>world this is a unique sequence it goes<br>back over 8,000 years and there's no<br>reason why that should stop happening<br>now so essentially what we know is that<br>the next day point fault earthquake is<br>inevitable and this tells you a little<br>bit more about the the nature of some of<br>those past events so of the last nine<br>ruptures eight of those have been over<br>four hundred kilometers in terms of the<br>rupture length and that's where the<br>fault breaks the surface so you'll see<br>an actual break in the in the surface<br>and so nine of those have been more than<br>four hundred kilometers long magnitude 8<br>earthquake the fault has now stored<br>enough energy for it to move roughly<br>about eight to ten meters horizontally<br>and to upward of two meters vertically<br>the next earthquake is likely to be a<br>magnitude 8 as well and just to give you<br>some context that's 22 times stronger<br>than the DA field earthquake the<br>magnitude 7.1 and 350 times stronger<br>than the February event now I do they<br>actually forget to mention up front that<br>if anyone's uncomfortable if anyone was<br>here during the Christchurch earthquake<br>and you're feeling uncomfortable I'm<br>happy for for you to leave the room if<br>it's causing you any anxiety will<br>concern so our point fault hazard risk<br>and impact these are some of the term<br>term terms that we use in this<br>conversation so in terms of our point<br>fault hazard we talked about frequency<br>in terms of when is the next event<br>likely to happen in other words a<br>probability of future events and how big<br>might a future event be and we're<br>talking about a magnitude range of<br>between Magnet between 7.9 and 8.2<br>that's the sort of magnitude envelope<br>that we talk about but a hazard doesn't<br>become a risk until pute until people<br>get in the way so then we start talking<br>about intensity how untell strong or<br>long will these effects be in turn in<br>space and time and what's the hesitant<br>going to look like and then the impact<br>in terms of the consequences in the end<br>our ability to start thinking ahead to<br>reducing some of our risk so I'm sure if<br>you're from Christchurch you'll you'll<br>have a pretty good understanding of of<br>these concepts of magnitude and<br>intensity but just to sort of recap<br>magnitude and in this context we are<br>talking about a magnitude 8 but again<br>somewhere between seven point nine and<br>eight point two is the most likely<br>magnitude range and we're expecting<br>intensities of between four and ten<br>around the South Island not specifically<br>in Christchurch so a magnitude magnitude<br>as a term what does it mean well it's<br>about the amount of energy that's<br>released by an earthquake intensity and<br>contrast is the amount<br>damage done on the Earth's surface so<br>these are very different concepts and we<br>needed both of those concepts because<br>magnitude does it is well I'll go on to<br>explain that it's a logarithmic scale so<br>it's measured from one to ten on a scale<br>a logarithmic scale which means that for<br>example if you had a magnitude 6<br>earthquake and you went up to a<br>magnitude 8 earthquake that's deadly to<br>toe that's nine hundred times more<br>seismic energy so going up one step is<br>32 times more seismically energetic<br>going up two times up the scale is nine<br>hundred times more seismic energy being<br>released intensity has ranges on a scale<br>from one to twelve where 12 is total<br>destruction of built infrastructure so<br>with magnitude the damage is worse<br>around the the rupture zone but with<br>intensity it's very much dependent on<br>how far away or where you are from the<br>epicenter and what the local ground<br>conditions are like so that leads me on<br>to talk about what are we actually doing<br>to to build our preparedness for a<br>future Alpine Fault earthquake and I'm<br>going to spend a few minutes now talking<br>about project AF eight which refers to<br>Alpine Fault magnitude eight and this is<br>a multi-agency approach to responding or<br>improving our response ability for a<br>future major earthquake on the Alpine<br>Fault it's funded by the ministry of<br>civil defense but it's co-founded by a<br>range of science programs right now<br>which I'll talk about and that's a<br>really important part of the partnership<br>approach that we're taking to doing this<br>work so it's very interdisciplinary and<br>it's very much working across<br>traditional domains of practice policy<br>and and research so this is the team<br>Angus McKay leads it from environment<br>Southland unsightly for the project so I<br>represent a group of about thirty a pine<br>fault scientists feeding the science<br>into the project and John Mitchell was<br>the project program manager alongside a<br>steering group which takes in all of the<br>Civil Defence Group managers around the<br>South Island from all of the six sedum<br>group regions and as I said this is a<br>very collaborative project across<br>disciplines and across policy practice<br>and research domains<br>and the the main funders of the work<br>from the science end as the earthquake<br>commission resilience to nature's<br>challenges which I'm funded by and also<br>quake core which is a center of research<br>excellence based here at the University<br>of Canterbury in Christchurch and also<br>the natural hazards research platform<br>and we have a huge number of partner<br>agencies work that we're working with on<br>this project and we're reaching across<br>those domains to build our collective on<br>our collective strengths for a common<br>purpose which is to improve our ability<br>to respond to a future Alpine fold<br>earthquake so I lead the risk team there<br>are about 30 researchers from a range of<br>institutions involved and our first task<br>was to develop a credible scientifically<br>rigorous Alpine Fault scenario so that<br>was the first task and I'll tell you a<br>bit more about that in a minute and then<br>that fit into a number of workshops that<br>were run right around the South Island<br>and also in Wellington with all of the<br>civil defence defence groups which is<br>then feeding into the development of a<br>response plan known as the safer plan<br>South Ireland Alpine Fault earthquake<br>response plan so that works under<br>underway at the moment in year two of<br>the project so what are the main goals I<br>won't go into great detail here but<br>simply put what we're trying to do is<br>look at what Alpine Fault earthquake<br>consequences might look like across the<br>South Island how are we going to respond<br>to those in the first seven days after<br>an event so we're not looking at a<br>long-term response we're looking just at<br>the first week and how can we improve<br>our ability to respond by working across<br>Emergency Management agencies and<br>targeting specific scientific work which<br>can build our understanding off of this<br>event before happens for example so we<br>know a lot about the fundamental science<br>of the Alpine Fault but it becomes a<br>much more complex case to then apply it<br>to how it might actually work in reality<br>for society what are those societal<br>impacts going to look like so we took<br>what we knew from the fundamental<br>science and we put it together into a<br>scenario which then was used<br>to figure out more about the<br>consequences and impacts of this event<br>so back in August last year I was asked<br>to run a workshop to Thresh out the<br>scenario now I have to say that this<br>built on previous efforts it had been<br>other there had been other work on<br>scenario development for the Alpine<br>Fault in 2013 a PhD student of ours<br>Tom Robinson developed the terrier<br>hopper exercise scenario for the Alpine<br>Fault so we built on previous efforts<br>here so but this was really feeding in<br>the most up-to-date science and so we've<br>got some really high caliber scientists<br>in the room here there's Calvin Berryman<br>here from genius science he did the work<br>and who Curry Creek and John O'Groats<br>we've got John Townend who's the he's at<br>Victoria University he leads the<br>environment man geology department up<br>there school up there sorry and Brendan<br>Bradley who's at Canterbury and I'll be<br>mentioning his name again shortly so we<br>had these we had this workshop we had<br>three teams working on developing the<br>scenario across these different areas so<br>the first team looked at the fundamental<br>science how will the Alpine Fault behave<br>what might the aftershock sequence look<br>look like what all the ground motions<br>look like for example and also looking<br>at the GM morphic outcomes<br>what about landslides what about<br>landslides dams and the sort of<br>cascading hazards that tend to happen<br>after a big earthquake so you have a lot<br>of sediment being ejected from the<br>Southern Alps what happens to all of<br>that well it goes out into the river<br>systems and clogs up you know river beds<br>and a grade the flat areas off the west<br>of the Southern Alps for example so<br>they're all these geomorphic<br>consequences that emerge we had a team<br>looking at the engineering side of it so<br>what about life funds infrastructure<br>roads electricity water for example in<br>the built environment how allowed<br>buildings handle this kind of level of<br>shaking and then we had a social science<br>team looking at casualties and juries<br>modelling communities and business<br>outcomes as well so all of that was very<br>you know interactive and we built this<br>scenario which has then gone on to feed<br>into the response team work around the<br>policy and planning side of things<br>so this is one of the regional workshops<br>in the targa so we had a really great<br>response around the regions when we took<br>the scenario out to exercise with civil<br>defense and their partner agencies so he<br>ran seven workshops around to the South<br>Island and in Wellington and we had over<br>500 people take part and these are all<br>people working for agencies like civil<br>defense like Erie health emergency<br>services etc and we've gone on to run a<br>series of smaller more targeted<br>workshops including<br>with your own District Health Board<br>recently we had a bunch of people<br>together with emergency services New<br>Zealand Defence Force etcetera so we're<br>getting down to the nitty-gritty now of<br>actually working quite closely with our<br>partner agencies to build response that<br>to build our response plan okay it<br>doesn't like that anymore okay so I'm<br>going to detail a bit more now about the<br>actual scenario that we put together so<br>what will an Alpine Fault earthquake be<br>like so going back to to the full extent<br>of the Alpine Fault as I mentioned this<br>is an 880 kilometer long fault it's it's<br>segmented due to a number of factors<br>like past earthquake behavior local<br>geology steepness of the fault all these<br>sorts of fundamental science sort of<br>issues end up meaning that the fault is<br>segmented in a number of ways and but<br>the segment we're most worried about<br>whether it stopped working is what we<br>call Alpine Fault f2k which is the 411<br>kilometer long section of the fault and<br>this is the one that went off in 1717 AD<br>which is the most recent Alpine Fault<br>earthquake so this is the one that the<br>now what will allow my fault earthquake<br>look like in terms of the intensity<br>footprint on the ground and this was the<br>best of our knowledge back in 2013 when<br>Tom Robinson was doing his work for the<br>scenario so if you look at the scale on<br>the intensity scale you can see<br>intensities of 8 and 9 right around the<br>fault rupture or the four hundred<br>kilometres it's actually going to unzip<br>during this event and as you come out<br>from the Alpine Fault you notice the<br>density sort of reducing away until you<br>get to four words fives and sixes on the<br>east coast of the South Island and<br>comparison this is the February event on<br>the same scale using the same colors and<br>so you can see here an Alpine Fault<br>event will release three hundred and<br>fifty times more seismic energy than the<br>February earthquake and you can see the<br>intensities here ranging from intensity<br>five up to intensity eight and central<br>part of that bull's eye I suppose you<br>could see but there have been recent<br>developments in terms of modeling ground<br>motions and this is the guy bring them<br>Bradley who I pointed out before he's<br>based at University of Canterbury and<br>he's got a supercomputer and an<br>incredibly good brain and he's got this<br>ability to just play with massive Doucet<br>so his computer has allowed him to<br>explore with his team a number of<br>different rupture scenarios for the<br>Alpine Fault so we're not just looking<br>at one one sort of intensity footprint<br>now we had the ability to model a<br>different range of different ones so<br>I've got three maps in front of us here<br>each of those heads are different it is<br>behaving in a different way it's running<br>out of batteries I think so the one on<br>your on your left is magnitude seven<br>point nine so this is the lower part of<br>the magnitude scale that we're thinking<br>of the Alpine Fault but the rapture<br>starts at the southern end of the fault<br>in this scenario and it pushes the<br>seismic energy up towards the Northeast<br>the one in the center plays around with<br>the idea that the Alpine Fault might<br>initiate in that central part and push<br>out the energy in two different ways we<br>call that a bilateral rapture and then<br>the one on your right is where the fault<br>ruptures the initiates and the northeast<br>part of the fault and pushes these<br>seismic energy mainly down towards the<br>southwest so these are three different<br>scenarios and of course these have very<br>different implications for the response<br>and recovery after the event so this has<br>just puts it into a slightly prettier<br>pictures this is the generic model that<br>I showed you from 2013 that was out the<br>best of our knowledge at that point and<br>so you can see it's sort of just the<br>elongated concentric rings around the<br>Alpine Fault<br>but now Brendan's models have an A<br>order us to do so much more detailed<br>thinking about intensity so this is the<br>central rapture you can see the X that's<br>where we think you know central rapture<br>might initiate and pushing energy out in<br>two different directions and in this<br>case you can see the intensity footprint<br>is much more intense or damaging in the<br>north northern part of the South Island<br>when you push the energy towards the<br>southwest so a north to south rapture<br>you can see it's a very different<br>outcome in terms of intensity footprint<br>across the South Island and a lot of the<br>damages restricted around the southern<br>alps region I suppose and then you've<br>got the south to north rupture so<br>imagine an earthquake starting and<br>milford sound and the energy really<br>being pushed up towards the Northeast<br>and you can see similarities between the<br>central and the north to south rupture<br>now of course with scientists there are<br>so many uncertainties they always want<br>more data but when I press them to tell<br>us which of these four scenarios it was<br>the most likely to happen in reality the<br>consensus was that the south to north<br>rupture was the most likely so that's<br>what we've based our scenario on when<br>we've gone out to the regions and<br>presented this scenario I'm going to<br>blow that up a little bit more services<br>how it looks across the South Island you<br>can see the Lower South Islands in<br>reasonably good shape across their<br>southern alps you've got intensities of<br>eight and nine sort of pockets<br>potentially of ten and places around the<br>west coast and you can see that that<br>Canterbury is experiencing more likely<br>to experience intensities of around five<br>six and seven around the Canterbury<br>Plains and I'll explain a little bit<br>about why that seems to be affecting<br>Canterbury slightly worse in a moment<br>now this is a video and I actually it is<br>presented by my colleague Angus McKay<br>down at Sir environment Southland the<br>lead for project day effect but what he<br>studied talks for a bit and then up will<br>come a ground motion simulation<br>generated by Brendan Bradley and his<br>team which gives you a bit of an idea of<br>how this will play out in a sort of a 3d<br>model now the vertical the vertical axis<br>is really exaggerated as you'll see but<br>it gives you an idea of how the seismic<br>hello my name is Angus McKay and I'm the<br>grip controller and manager of emergency<br>management Southland I'm also the chair<br>of the project FH steering group so<br>project f8 is a South Island initiative<br>is funded by the Ministry of Civil<br>Defence and emergency management<br>resilience fund to produce a South<br>Island Alpine Fault emergency response<br>plan or safer plant for short<br>the name af8 simply refers to the likely<br>magnitude of an Alpine Fault rupture<br>something that will happen in the<br>lifetime of people alive today the first<br>year of project AFA has been about<br>raising awareness of what an Alpine<br>Fault event would look like and<br>understanding how it would impact the<br>whole of New Zealand if we needed any<br>reminder of how important this planning<br>is then the quakes that shook Canterbury<br>Marlborough and Wellington in November<br>were a useful taste of what the Alpine<br>Fault will deliver to focus our minds on<br>what a credible scenario would look like<br>for the Alpine Fault we realized from<br>the start that we had to partner with<br>the science community and we're very<br>fortunate to be joined on the project<br>AFA team by dr. Caroline Augustine so<br>last August in 2016 Caroline led a<br>two-day workshop inviting all the key<br>scientists around New Zealand to share<br>their knowledge and develop the scenario<br>for project a afraid to use the amount<br>of cooperation willingness to devote<br>time and energy to the project and the<br>further follow-up work that has been<br>ongoing over the last few months has<br>been involved invaluable to project AFA<br>this has involved scientists from gns<br>science near the universities of<br>Canterbury Auckland Otago massery and<br>Victoria resilient organisations and<br>market economics the resilient rural<br>backbone priority co-creation laboratory<br>has been instrumental in supporting<br>Caroline and other the other scientists<br>including a number of PhD students to<br>directly support just pause them there<br>just put them into the background but so<br>what you saw there was as those waves<br>move through the Canterbury Basin you<br>probably noticed that there was a lot of<br>sort of jiggling around and sort of like<br>jelly on a plate really and that's a lot<br>to do of course with the local geology<br>so you've got your sedimentary layers<br>right under the basin there and they<br>behavior differently from a solid rock<br>sort of foundation so there's a lot of<br>sort of reverberation of those seismic<br>waves as they move through the<br>Canterbury Plains as you'd expect now I<br>mean that in terms of the style of<br>shaking it would be a very different<br>feeling quake than you may have<br>experienced during the February event so<br>you really got the upper cut you know<br>right beneath the city during that event<br>but this Alpine Fault earthquake would<br>feel much more like a rolling kind of<br>event this as a long-duration long<br>distant distant source of event for you<br>so that the the outcome there would be<br>that much more of a rolling event rather<br>than the very high vertical and<br>horizontal accelerations that you<br>experienced in February likely to<br>experience liquefaction again but<br>there's a lot more work happening in<br>that space right now so quake core is<br>running a whole work stream about<br>looking using the South Pine fault<br>scenario to model the likely outcomes in<br>terms of liquefaction and around the<br>South Island but also specifically in<br>Christchurch as well so watch this space<br>because that work won't be completed<br>until next year<br>so what other kind of outcomes do we<br>talk about in the scenario so surface<br>rupture we learned a lot about this<br>during the kaikoura quake<br>so the kaikoura event ruptured 180<br>kilometers in terms of debt breaking the<br>surface it actually took place across 21<br>different faults which was a world-first<br>no-one had no no earthquake had ever<br>been noted to have done that before that<br>was like ground breaking stuff what<br>we're expecting with the Alpine Fault is<br>I've mentioned as a 400 kilometer long<br>rupture so almost twice said of the<br>kaikoura quake and in terms of the<br>seismic energy released i talked about<br>this logarithmic scale the 7.8 kaikoura<br>event<br>released half as much seismic energy as<br>so another important thing and again we<br>saw this in the cocora case was the<br>cascading nature of hazards as they<br>emerge after an earthquake so we have an<br>earthquake event which then sort of<br>triggers a whole sequence of events<br>including landslides landslides then can<br>cross rivers and cause landslide dams<br>and those dams can back up with water<br>behind them if for example you had heavy<br>rain and over top which then creates a<br>significant hazard for people below<br>communities or people in the valleys<br>below so we saw 40 different landslide<br>dams being monitored during the Kaikoura<br>quake and we would expect many more of<br>that through the Southern Alps during<br>this event that we have been talking<br>about today again Tom Robinson going<br>back to his work he modeled the<br>likelihood of landslides following a<br>magnitude 8 earthquake on the Alpine<br>Fault and this is what it looks like in<br>terms of distribution across the South<br>Island so of course the Alpine region<br>will experience the most landslide<br>activity of course because it's high and<br>very few landslides you can see a few<br>coming through into the kaikoura ranges<br>but mainly within the alps and then you<br>can take a model like that and try and<br>understand how vulnerable or exposed our<br>highways are and our critical<br>infrastructure like the power<br>transmission network so this is looking<br>at the likelihood of a landslide<br>affecting those different<br>infrastructures and as you can see the<br>warmer colors and around the alpine area<br>indicate most the most exposure to<br>disruption from landslides after an<br>Alpine Fault the earthquake and we know<br>how people move around by Road this is a<br>Flo's model for transport it's actually<br>about ten years old now but it still<br>gives you a sense for how our highway<br>networks are being used by people and<br>cars and and other forms of transport<br>and you know transport one of our<br>critical infrastructures in terms of<br>recovery and response you know we need<br>to be able to get around and what we saw<br>after the cocora quake again was massive<br>disruption to people's lives and<br>livelihoods this is the the kicker Dinu<br>or is it one of the other kicker doing a<br>photo quality I think coming across the<br>highway here you can see damaging the<br>Highway and rail network and causing a<br>reef to develop off the coast here where<br>those waves are breaking but it was<br>actually the landslides that have done<br>the most damage and we're seeing you<br>know almost a whole year since state<br>highway 1 was open north of kaikoura we<br>are also able now to and this is very<br>new kind of new work use those intensity<br>footprints to compare or to overlay our<br>critical infrastructure and see where<br>we're most vulnerable and as you can see<br>I mean it's a little bit small probably<br>but so we've got the electricity rail<br>mobile phone and telecommunications and<br>Road and of course anywhere that's in<br>around the Alps the the the pastures you<br>know Arthur's past Louis past all of the<br>passes across the apps are going to be<br>highly vulnerable to closure and will be<br>closed for many months after this event<br>and electricity again is highly<br>vulnerable as well and I'll talk a bit<br>more about that because the top image is<br>of Lake been more the been more dam and<br>this is a critical asset in the the dam<br>infrastructure of the cellphone and the<br>hydro generating dam we would expect and<br>again this is this is in the scenario<br>the scenario isn't predicting exactly<br>what's going to happen it's our sort of<br>best guess at what the outcomes of the<br>Alpine Fault might look like but we<br>would expect that lions and transformers<br>will be damaged by this event dams will<br>shut down because that's what they do<br>when they are shaken and been more it<br>requires power to restart so when binbin<br>more goes down it needs electricity to<br>get it going again which is a bit of a<br>problem if you don't have power<br>another key vulnerability is the<br>internet island cable so we we actually<br>send power to the North Island and<br>actually they can see in power back down<br>to us if our hydro dams of a low in this<br>event if we're pumping electricity to<br>the North Island there are significant<br>implications for power supply going<br>across to the North Island as well so<br>and again I think this is important to<br>note that the Alpine Fault isn't just a<br>sapphire<br>and what a wide event it's an event<br>that's going to affect the whole country<br>again in this scenario and again you<br>know don't take this too much to heart<br>because it could well be something<br>different but expert panel of hazard<br>scientists suggests that power will be<br>severely and for a prolonged period of<br>time down across the South Island so<br>that we were widespread blackouts and<br>this is the first seven day after the<br>event communication similarly if<br>communications are relying on<br>electricity so if their power dependent<br>they'll go down along with the critical<br>infrastructure around electricity and so<br>there won't be any comms unless you<br>happen to have a satellite phone so<br>there'll behavior reliance on set phone<br>usage after this event so hopefully that<br>gives you a taste of what the Alpine<br>Fault earthquake might be like for the<br>South Island I'm just going to finish<br>with just a couple of reflections on the<br>project day effect journey over the last<br>15 months and some of the our ability to<br>reach out to the public which has been<br>really positive for the most part each<br>time we ran a workshop the local<br>newspaper would run a a story about it<br>so we managed to get quite a lot of<br>coverage this is the ODT just after the<br>match match workshop or February which<br>up in Otago and then we had quite a good<br>write-up in the press this was on staff<br>but I'm not sure if you recall the front<br>page of the press but what the staff<br>media allowed us to do was to sort of<br>look at the comments and get some<br>feedback from the public on on their<br>perceptions of this work that we're<br>doing and so you know it allowed John<br>Mitchell and others and on the team to<br>actually interact with people and sort<br>of maybe quell some misconceptions or<br>relieve some stress you know some<br>anxiety around this sort of the staff<br>which I think was really really positive<br>and this was the front page of the press<br>and match I think it was March of this<br>year which had a companion piece on page<br>8 that really detailed the scenario and<br>I remember when I saw this and read the<br>scenario I was really concerned that<br>especially for Christchurch people will<br>be you know dragging up a whole lot of<br>new anxiety and worry for them and I was<br>really concerned about that but actually<br>the the comments that we received were<br>really positive for the most part they<br>were all there are always people who who<br>don't like to hear about this stuff and<br>I'll give you an example this is a total<br>waste of time and resources the whole<br>process caters to a small segment of the<br>population that needs a threat of<br>disaster in their lives the bureaucratic<br>types who take jobs in the disaster<br>industry love to pretend to control the<br>uncontrollable beside all that it does<br>scare impressionable people and that is<br>inexcusable and of course my heart sort<br>of sank a little bit when I read that<br>because I thought this person's really<br>really concerned and worried and I<br>didn't want to cause worry but the<br>public response to that was 59 thumbs<br>down so the comments you know people can<br>do a thumbs up or down and I was quite<br>pleased to see 60 people thought no<br>that's not that's not that's not cool<br>and then in response to that someone put<br>up this comment no they're not trying to<br>control the uncontrollable they're<br>preparing for the inevitable we were<br>rather naive in this country thinking<br>that a big earthquake was a long time<br>off and if it did happen it would be in<br>Wellington two major quakes in<br>Christchurch and another in cocora have<br>proven otherwise the message is quite<br>simple get on with your life but simply<br>be prepared and that received the<br>positive response from people which was<br>was was good and I think this speaks of<br>a sort of a change in social norm around<br>earthquakes in earthquake preparedness<br>in New Zealand largely thanks to the<br>Canterbury Earthquake sequence because<br>before that we hadn't had a major urban<br>earthquake for decades pretty much since<br>the earthquake of 1931 we'd had the<br>ananga who are event in 1968 but we'd<br>had a good 40 ideas of no big<br>earthquakes in New Zealand so there was<br>a huge amount of complacency but now<br>we're really back on our game you'd have<br>to say and I think while it is difficult<br>and and not very pleasant to have to<br>deal with we need to think about it and<br>I think the work that we're doing and I<br>hope the work we're doing is as<br>contributing to building our resilience<br>and our preparedness for a future a<br>five-fold earthquake so I'd like to<br>thank you for coming and I'd like to<br>thank all our sponsors<br>the national science challenge here and<br>quite core especially have been<br>incredibly supportive of this work and<br>is quite Commission so thanks a lot for<br>coming and I'm happy to take questions<br>mmm so it's about wow it's complex but I<br>guess in simple terms it's about the<br>amount of relative motion across the<br>plate boundaries so we have the<br>Australia the Pacific plate moving at<br>about 30 to 40 millimeters per year and<br>against the Australian plate so that in<br>itself is accumulating energy there are<br>a number of other reasons there<br>Geophysical quite complex science<br>reasons I suppose for for why that<br>particular segment of the Alpine Fault<br>is most likely to go again but it's<br>largely about stress accumulation as<br>it's known and to the best knowledge of<br>a scientist that's the diction of the<br>fault that was is most likely to go<br>yep<br>yeah yeah yeah I mean look it's really<br>difficult in New Zealand we don't have<br>any real redundancy around our highway<br>network and in fact most of our critical<br>infrastructure so when things go down<br>we're just going to have to learn to<br>live with that for quite a period of<br>time and we have in the event of Kokoro<br>we've redirected traffic around<br>different parts of the road and of<br>course that has caused problems it's<br>called cause social problems in terms of<br>small communities down that section of<br>the highway experiencing a massive boom<br>and trade and not actually being able to<br>keep up and that causing business owners<br>stress but also being a positive thing<br>because they're getting more income so<br>there's been a redistribution of travel<br>around the South Island and that's what<br>will happen in the event of a nap I fold<br>it berth quake but you know well yeah<br>exactly but I mean that's that's pretty<br>unlikely from all the modelling we've<br>done all of those passes will be out for<br>a prolonged period of time I mean I give<br>you the example of Kaikoura<br>oh sorry Taiwan and 1999 they had a<br>Alpine pass similar to ours which<br>experienced heavy damage after the<br>cheechee earthquake of that year and it<br>took about a year for them to figure out<br>whether they were going to even start to<br>try and build it back they did build it<br>back at vast expense about quarter of a<br>billion dollars at that stage and then a<br>site typhoon came through and wiped it<br>out again so they abandoned it after<br>after many years of trying to<br>reestablish it so I think you know in<br>all honesty we will have to learn to<br>live with the fact that we won't be able<br>to sit access quite a few parts of the<br>South Island for a period of time yeah<br>yep<br>yes absolutely and again quake core is<br>also working on modeling the damage to<br>buildings across the South Ireland - so<br>you've had a massive change in the<br>building the makeup of your buildings<br>here in Christchurch which has made you<br>a much more resilient City and your<br>buildings aren't going to be high-rise<br>so in terms of that long duration<br>shaking low-rise buildings will do<br>pretty well in those conditions so I<br>would say that of all the parts of the<br>South Island in terms of built<br>infrastructure the building's crash it<br>yep<br>yeah mm-hmm yeah so you're quite right<br>tsunami risk when initially when you<br>talk about tsunami my first thought goes<br>to an undersea rapture which pushes a<br>body of water as the fault moves and<br>that's what we saw in the boxing day is<br>quite outcome you know a mess of<br>shifting of the sea floor<br>but in this event the section of the out<br>point what we're talking about only goes<br>off a tiny bit off shore often offered<br>sound so most of it's on land so it<br>wouldn't generate a tsunami and this<br>scenario but what can happen is that<br>rock fall can land in a body body of<br>water like a lake and and distribute and<br>sort of displaced water in a similar way<br>so you can have what's called a rock<br>fall tsunami in a lake and milford sound<br>for example there are deposits in the<br>bottom of the fjord that we know were<br>generated by Alpine Fault earthquakes<br>there's evidence of about 26 different<br>landslide deposits at the bottom of<br>milford sound each of those has it has<br>the potential to have created a massive<br>tsunami wave in milford sound of up to<br>90 100 meters in wave height so milford<br>sound is particularly vulnerable to rock<br>force tsunami as our other lakes around<br>that the south island as you mentioned<br>and taro and some of the canterbury<br>lakes as well<br>the other thing that happens when you<br>shake a body of water and you've<br>probably all experienced this when you<br>are a kid and you're trying to take a<br>cup of tea to your mum and dad in bed<br>and as soon as you start and start to<br>shake because you try not to spill it it<br>starts to slosh up and down and next<br>minute there's only half a cup of tea<br>that's what happens of the lake you<br>shake a body of water and it starts to<br>slosh at each side of the lake and so it<br>can end and date around the lake margin<br>which it can be quite significant yeah<br>like like quickly yeah what good to do<br>here<br>any other questions well thank you so<br>yeah and I'd go to the extent of saying<br>years actually because a magnitude 8<br>earthquake will change the seismicity of<br>of the background seismicity of a region<br>like the South Island for for more than<br>just months actually thanks for bringing<br>it up because I didn't talk a lot about<br>aftershocks but you all know having been<br>here that aftershocks are gonna we'll do<br>go on and they can be quite severe so<br>we're expecting magnitude seven<br>aftershocks after this Alpine Fault<br>earthquake which will you know just add<br>to the damage and the stress and yeah<br>the seismicity will continue to be<br>elevated for quite a long time after<br>this event yeah good question yeah so<br>again that's really important because<br>when we're talking about the response to<br>the Alpine Fault Wellington is going to<br>be in the box seat to lead that response<br>certainly so we had a workshop in<br>Wellington just to sort of sort of<br>thrash that out with with them in terms<br>of how that might work we knew that<br>there were lots of complex issues that<br>emerged after the Canterbury earthquakes<br>in terms of how that was handled and we<br>still to be fair we haven't actually got<br>to the bottom of that there's still a<br>lot of work to do in terms of you know<br>when you're when you're launching a<br>response across the whole South Island<br>and potentially Wellington's compromised<br>we don't quite know how that's going to<br>work so in terms of level of damage we<br>would suggest and we haven't done the<br>project af8 scope was the South Island<br>we didn't actually do modeling to<br>incorporate Wellington but from the best<br>of our knowledge would be that<br>Wellington will be damaged and it would<br>be similar to probably what they felt in<br>the kaikoura quake is sort of similar<br>level of damage so that could again<br>challenge further what the response<br>yeah yeah mmm so yeah I mean this is<br>where it gets really really tricky<br>because it's very difficult difficult to<br>predict what who's going to be in the<br>best shape to sort of act as a staging<br>post for that kind of a response so I<br>think very quickly even given the calm<br>the compromised communications network<br>that we're going to have will quickly<br>need to establish where the best places<br>are to to sort of launch that kind of<br>response so there has been talk of<br>Nelson potentially being one one place<br>where it might be in good enough shape<br>to sort of host a whole lot of<br>casualties and injuries Canterbury would<br>certainly be a place that we would hope<br>would be in good enough shape and it<br>might be that Dunedin and Olympic Argyll<br>could be a secondary but again you know<br>it's going to be a massive challenge in<br>there we don't have hundreds of<br>helicopters and we don't have an<br>infinite supply of F gas to run these<br>planes and helicopters around the South<br>Island so it's going to be a task which<br>will require a huge amount of<br>prioritization so life safety will go<br>first in terms of trying to get people<br>out who are injured but there'll be some<br>really difficult decisions that are made<br>about who and when and how people were<br>taken out yeah maybe we get navy off the<br>wrist Kirsty I mean that's been talked<br>about too so Queenstown always springs<br>to mind as a major challenge because you<br>know we might have forty or fifty<br>thousand tourists there on a summer's<br>day so if this you know timings<br>everything<br>if this event happens picked summer<br>daytime versus middle of winter and<br>nighttime yeah it's just hugely<br>difficult to imagine how that might play<br>yeah yeah and I guess in terms of<br>project de fête in its scope we sort of<br>limited ourselves to just enough I fold<br>event on its own but that's not to say<br>that it certainly could load up false<br>along the plate boundary so there is<br>work going on that's modeling the the<br>potential for the Alpine Fault to load<br>up the wire our fault going through<br>Nelson Desmond and potentially trigger<br>something there or you know we we saw<br>after the cocora quake it triggered slow<br>slip events through Cook Strait and up<br>along the hook arrangement margin so<br>it's almost certainly there will be<br>seismic events that happen in some way<br>across the plate boundary because it's<br>all interconnected but we can't say with<br>any degree of certainty how that might</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
