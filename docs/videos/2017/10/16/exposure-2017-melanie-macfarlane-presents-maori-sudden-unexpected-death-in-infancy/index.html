accurate.</p><p>Kurata my name is Melanie McFarland and<br>today I'm going to talk to you a little<br>bit about the work that I've been doing<br>as part of my PhD in the department of<br>pediatrics under the supervision of<br>Professor ed Mitchell thank you so much<br>for the opportunity first though I'd<br>like to share with you a story Mary Jane<br>is 29 years of age<br>she's MALDI she lives in South Auckland<br>with her partner and their three<br>children including two month old baby<br>Jack Jack being the first boy is adored<br>by his parents his sisters and his way<br>too far know most of the time Jack<br>sleeps in his own cot in his mum and<br>dad's room sometimes at night after a<br>feed if it's really cold or if Mary Jane<br>is really tired Jack will sleep and bed<br>with his mum and dad just like her<br>sisters did before him one morning after<br>such a night Mary Jane woke up and<br>reached out to cuddle jack she noticed<br>that his face and lips were cold and he<br>was unresponsive<br>Jack had died while his mum and dad<br>slept in the bed beside him now Mary<br>Jane is not an actual person but she<br>does represent the parents of the 40 to<br>50 babies each year in New Zealand who<br>died suddenly and unexpectedly usually<br>during sleep and initially without<br>explanation Sudi is an acronym for<br>sudden unexpected death and infancy it<br>used to be known as cot death or since<br>but sue T is a broader term because it<br>includes unexplained deaths as well as<br>those for which an actual or possible<br>cause can be identified the key things<br>is there a suti death a sudden and<br>unexpected it occurs in an infant under<br>one year of age and even after a<br>thorough investigation a cause may or<br>may not be found in New Zealand we have<br>seen a reduction in rates over the<br>past five to six years however we still<br>have the highest rate among developed<br>countries so he continues to be a<br>leading cause of infant mortality in<br>this country and Maori infants are<br>overrepresented in these statistics<br>so why is it that moldy infants are more<br>likely today from compared to non<br>Modi the New Zealand cop death study<br>which was undertaken in the late 1980s<br>by Professor Mitchell looked at this and<br>found that the difference could be<br>explained by the higher exposure among<br>modak infants to smoking in pregnancy<br>and to bed sharing bed sharing is when<br>another person adult or child is asleep<br>on the same sleep surface as the baby we<br>have that be a bed a couch or a mattress<br>on the floor in New Zealand more than<br>half of all city deaths occur in a bed<br>sharing situation part of my research<br>involves looking at that disparity<br>between Maori and non-maori suti from a<br>contemporary perspective and to do this<br>I've drawn on data from the suti<br>nationwide study so this study used a<br>prospective case control design we<br>implemented the study across New Zealand<br>over a three-year period from March 2012<br>through 2015 now in New Zealand all<br>sudden unexpected or unnatural deaths a<br>refer to a coroner and these include CD<br>cases during our study we had 137<br>cases refer to a coroner and these<br>became our case group of these we<br>interviewed 133 which was equal to a 97<br>percent response rate infants in the<br>control group were randomly sampled and<br>then selected by district health boards<br>from their Hospital birth registers and<br>off these 258 or 40% of parents that<br>were selected were interviewed for the<br>control group data was collected a data<br>were collected through face-to-face<br>interviews with cases and controls<br>usually with mothers and these<br>interviews were based on detailed health<br>focused questionnaires we also collected<br>a set of photographs of sleep scene<br>reconstruction<br>a cloth doll for example the photograph<br>on the Left shows the position that the<br>baby was placed to sleep and the<br>photograph on the right shows the<br>position of the baby when they were<br>found awake all four cases found<br>unresponsive these photos are from a<br>control set so during the study Modi<br>unsurprisingly had the highest suti rate<br>of 1.37 deaths for every 1000 live<br>births and this is compared to the much<br>lower rate for non Modi of 0.53 now the<br>New Zealand cot death study identified<br>smoking and pregnancy and bed sharing as<br>key risk factors for more than 25<br>years ago we used auds ratios to<br>determine the effect of these risk<br>factors for an infant's risk of<br>today smoking in pregnancy lead to a 6<br>times greater increase in the risk of so<br>different and fent and hearing<br>lead to an almost 5 times greater<br>increase in the risk of<br>interestingly the effect of these 2<br>factors did not differ between Maori and<br>non-maori so that's that's relevant and<br>we're going to come back to that point<br>we were differences in prevalence<br>however particularly around smoking and<br>pregnancy and you can see in the case<br>results over there Maori mothers were<br>more likely to smoke at 87 percent -<br>computed a 62% for non-maori and in the<br>control group Maori mothers were twice<br>as likely to smoke at 47% compared with<br>just 23% for non Modi now be cheering on<br>the other hand was practice relatively<br>equally by Maori and non-maori and the<br>case group Maori and non-maori and the<br>control group in fact you can see that<br>there is just a 2 to 3 Pacific<br>difference in prevalence within these<br>two groups we also looked at the way the<br>two factors interact with each other and<br>what that meant for an infant's risk of<br> and we found their infants exposed<br>to both factors<br>we're 32 times greater increased risk of<br> compared to an infant that was not<br>exposed to smoking and pregnancy and not<br>exposed to bed sharing again that effect<br>of the interaction did not differ<br>between Maori and non-maori so what does<br>that all mean well we know that smoking<br>and pregnancy and bed cheering continue<br>to represent a risk to infants today for<br> we know that the individual risk<br>factors don't defer in terms of how they<br>affect infants so it's the same<br>regardless of ethnicity<br>likewise with that interaction we know<br>that the two factors combined amplify<br>that risk but again that relationship<br>was no different between Maori and<br>non-maori so what was different the<br>prevalence of smoking among Maori is the<br>biggest difference or what it means is<br>that Maori infants are more likely to be<br>exposed to both factors so to the<br>dangerous combination of smoking and<br>pregnancy and to be cheering so what can<br>we do about this well preventing the<br>risk would be the ideal approach by not<br>smoking<br>however for mums that did smoke during<br>pregnancy a pragmatic approach would be<br>to enable and promote infant safe sleep<br>for that for that month for those<br>mothers now infants safe sleep was not a<br>new message however there has been a<br>groundswell in recent years regarding<br>the promotion and about availability of<br>safe sleep devices such as the<br>traditionally woven flex Wakuda that led<br>by Professor Tiffany leach and the<br>plastic version called a pee-pee pod<br>which was developed by Stephanie Cohen<br>following the 2011 Canterbury<br>earthquakes safe sleep devices enable<br>infants to be chair safely while still<br>maintaining their closeness and their<br>easy accessibility for breastfeeding<br>also the Ministry of Health have just<br>funded a national suti Prevention<br>just going back to that disparity we<br>know that the difference can continue to<br>be explained by the higher exposure<br>among mode infants to smoking and<br>pregnancy but just putting aside<br>ethnicity and smoking status the message<br>that I'd like to leave you with today is<br>that the most important thing is to<br>support and encourage and enable<br>families to make sure every sleep is a<br>safe sleep for baby thank you so much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
