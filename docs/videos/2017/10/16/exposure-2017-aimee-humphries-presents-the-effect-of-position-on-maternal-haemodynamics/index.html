Ali mucho Lilly for being fantastic<br>supervisors so I'm looking at this in<br>relation to late stillbirth which is<br>defined as intrauterine death after 28<br>weeks gestation which as you can imagine<br>for expectant parents only months away<br>from welcoming Leigh a little baby girl<br>a little baby boy into the world this is<br>a hugely devastating outcome and it<br>still occurs in around two to five per<br>thousand births even in high-income<br>countries making it a significant<br>obstetrics problem now the Auckland<br>stillbirth study in 2011 was the first<br>of its kind to show that maternal sleep<br>position had a significant role in<br>increasing the risk of late still birth<br>and this was later backed up by the<br>Sydney still bear study in 2015 in a<br>large study coming out of the UK this<br>year and what all of these studies have<br>shown is that woman who sleep in a<br>supine position that is lying on their<br>back in late pregnancy have a<br>significantly increased risk for late<br>stillbirth and this is thought to come<br>into play as part of a triple risk model<br>where you may have a mother at increased<br>risk of stillbirth already a fetus in an<br>already compromised situation and throw<br>into the mix and acute fetal stressor in<br>this case maternal sleep position and<br>this may act as the tipping point<br>resulting in still birth and one of the<br>repose mechanisms behind this<br>association is thought to be that when a<br>woman in her third trimester lies on her<br>back the gravid uterus acutely obstructs<br>her inferior vena cava which is the<br>large vein returning blood back to the<br>heart<br>thus acute obstruction is thought to be<br>compensated for by an adequate adequate<br>collateral venous system providing an<br>alternative route for blood to return<br>back to the heart<br>and this therefore enables them to<br>maintain their blood pressure at a<br>normal level<br>however we speculate that women with<br>inadequate cholesterol venous drainage<br>potentially due to anatomical variations<br>in the system may have a reduced ability<br>to compensate for this and therefore may<br>drop their blood pressure in the supine<br>position and this is seen clinically as<br>supine hypertensive syndrome which is<br>where a woman feels faint or dizzy or<br>may even lose consciousness when lying<br>on her back and occurs and around eight<br>to ten percent of women in their third<br>trimester and we speculate with a woman<br>in this category may be a further<br>increased risk of late stillbirth due to<br>this acting is that fetal stress or now<br>these are a couple of MRI images taken<br>in an axial plane so if you imagine it's<br>been cut right through the middle of a<br>woman and her third trimester we have<br>the gravid uterus here with the fetus<br>inside as you can see the abdomen here<br>with the legs and we've got the inferior<br>vena cava and the aorta sitting just on<br>top of the vertebral column here now in<br>the Lea flexural position the IVC is<br>completely patent however when the woman<br>turns supine it becomes quite<br>dramatically compressed and in this<br>scenario it's thought that a system of<br>veins called the azygos system provides<br>a collateral pathway from the pelvis<br>back to the thorax and I know this<br>picture looks a little scary but this is<br>the inferior vena cava coming here and<br>it splits into the common ilac veins<br>further down in the pelvis this gives<br>off the ascending lumbar vein which<br>travels up beside the vertebral column<br>to join with the sub costal vein at the<br>level of the diaphragm this forms the<br>Hemi azygos vein on the left hand side<br>and the azygos vein on the right hand<br>side and this Hemi as I guess along with<br>its accessory himhe as I guess<br>eventually drained back until this main<br>as a gues vein which drains back to the<br>superior vena cava and therefore the<br>heart creating a nice collateral pathway<br>from the pelvis back to the thorax now<br>the following image I'm going to show is<br>of a cadaver or a person who has donated<br>their body to science in which I've<br>dissected out the system<br>so just to orientate you the head is up<br>the striction the legs are down this<br>direction and we're looking at the<br>vertebral column from a slightly left<br>hand left hand view to make it easier<br>the IVC has been reflected off to the<br>right here and splits into the common<br>alley act things and the pelvis the<br>ascending lumbar bone travels up beside<br>the vertebral column to join at the sub<br>costal vein at the level of the<br>diaphragm because we're looking at the<br>left hand side this forms the hemizygous<br>vein which drains back into that main as<br>a guest vein which then will drain back<br>to the heart so as you can appreciate a<br>nice alternative pathway from the pelvis<br>back to the thorax however the system of<br>veins has never been studied before in<br>pregnancy so the aim of our study was to<br>investigate the effect of the supine and<br>left lateral positions on maternal blood<br>flow in late pregnancy using MRI we<br>obtained ethics approval to recruit<br>healthy pregnant woman and we use a 3t<br>MRI scanner to scan them in the supine<br>and left lateral positions we took axial<br>phase contrast images at the level of<br>the aortic root and images of the azygos<br>vein at a similar level just before it<br>joins that superior vena cava we also<br>took images of the abdominal aorta in<br>the IVC just above the level of the<br>renal veins and just above the aortic<br>bifurcation and we analyzed these images<br>using a software called sing go via<br>which allowed us to calculate net<br>forward volume through a specified<br>region of interest in this case had the<br>ascending aorta as it comes off the<br>ventricle and we combine this with heart<br>rate to calculate cardiac output which<br>is a measure of how much blood is pumped<br>around the body per minute and blood<br>flow through the azygos a Horta and IVC<br>so we recruited 12 pregnant woman<br>without supine hypotensive syndrome and<br>these women had a gestational age<br>between 34 and 38 weeks so in that third<br>trimester all of these women had a<br>normal pre-pregnancy BMI with an average<br>of 23 point three and went on to have<br>normal pregnancy outcomes so what we<br>found was that blood flow reduced<br>significantly in the supine position<br>through the ovc by 43.5% at the level of<br>the renal veins and 86.5%<br>at the<br>of the ibc origin so in keeping with<br>that IBC compression that we've talked<br>about however we also found that cardiac<br>output reduced by fifteen point five<br>percent in the supine position and I'm<br>going to talk about the significance of<br>these results in just a moment we found<br>their blood flow through the azygos vein<br>increased by a hundred and sixty four<br>point five percent maternal heart rate<br>increased by eleven point seven percent<br>however the most surprising results came<br>when we measured the blood flow through<br>the aorta it's reduced by seventeen<br>percent at the level of the renal veins<br>and thirty six point six percent at the<br>level of the aortic bifurcation now to<br>put all of these numbers into a bit of<br>context what we're seeing is that in the<br>supine position there is a reduction in<br>venous flow due to that IVC compression<br>that we've talked about and that this is<br>of the magnitude of eighty six point<br>five percent this will reduce the blood<br>flow back to the heart therefore<br>reducing cardiac output which we've<br>showed to decrease by fifteen point five<br>percent now cardiac output is directly<br>related to the pressure within the<br>arterial system which were there<br>therefore also decrease this will<br>stimulate the maternal sympathetic<br>nervous system to increase maternal<br>heart rate in order to try and<br>compensate for that drop in cardiac<br>output which we've showed to increase by<br>eleven point seven percent now the level<br>of IVC obstruction in below there'll be<br>an increase in venous pressure due to<br>blood pooling in the extremities and<br>unable to return back to the heart this<br>will force blood into the collateral<br>venous circulation which we've showed to<br>increase by one hundred and sixty four<br>point five percent and that will serve<br>to try and increase venous return back<br>to the heart<br>however this increase in venous pressure<br>and a decrease in mean arterial pressure<br>is likely to reduce driving pressure<br>across the lower capillary beds and<br>therefore explain the reduction in<br>arterial blood flow that we're seeing<br>and this is of the magnitude of<br>thirty-six point thirty six point six<br>percent which is not insignificant<br>especially when you consider that the<br>uterine artery which supplies blood flow<br>to the placenta comes off below this<br>point so unless there are significant<br>vascular resistance changes occurring<br>across the placenta there is likely to<br>be a significant reduction in blood flow<br>this will reduce oxygen delivery to the<br>fetus and therefore act as a significant<br>fetal stress or<br>and this is important to remember that<br>this is occurring and woman who can lie<br>on their back without experiencing any<br>symptoms whatsoever and if you think<br>back to that triple risk model while a<br>healthy fetus may be able to tolerate<br>these changes and only healthy one this<br>could be the tipping point so our study<br>is currently limited to normal pregnant<br>women that we have significant questions<br>about how these results will change with<br>women who do experience supine<br>hypertensive syndrome and we question<br>whether this is potentially due to<br>anatomical variations and that<br>collateral venous system that I've<br>talked about so we're currently in the<br>process of recruiting and scanning women<br>with the syndrome<br>we also question whether these results<br>would be different between lying on the<br>left and the right hand sides due to<br>normal anatomical differences between<br>the two with the IVC being more on the<br>right-hand side so again we're currently<br>in the process of doing this study as<br>well so in conclusion the supine<br>position causes important maternal<br>hemodynamic changes during later<br>pregnancy in the essica system of veins<br>has been shown for the first time to be<br>utilized as a collateral venous pathway<br>in order to try and compensate for this<br>however despite this we're still seeing<br>significant reductions in maternal<br>arterial blood flow which has the<br>potential to reduce placental blood flow<br>and act as a fetal stress or and this<br>work in combination with a lot of work<br>that's being done by the maternal sleep<br>in pregnancy Research Group is leading<br>on to a future public health campaign to<br>recommend a woman to not sleep on their<br>back during late pregnancy and I'd just<br>like to quickly thank all the<br>participants of the study for their<br>invaluable contributions the maternal<br>semen pregnancy research group that I've<br>already mentioned and the staff and<br>technicians at the Center for advanced<br>MRI and Keo kids for funding the project<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
