font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening everyone today I'm going to<br>briefly talk you through the steps that<br>I'm taking in my PhD to rationally<br>design a vaccine for the bacterial group<br>a streptococcus based on this protein<br>called the T antigen so immune system is<br>this really complex really clever<br>machinery inside of you that protects<br>you from disease-causing microbes every<br>day every second of every day but it<br>actually has a memory of its own so when<br>you're exposed to something and you get<br>sick your immune system develops this<br>really strong really specific response<br>to their organism that's causing your<br>disease and it remembers that so next<br>time you see it again as primed it's<br>ready to go you won't even know that<br>you've got sick with that same organism<br>so what vaccination tries to do is it<br>seeks to exploit this a little bit by<br>giving your body and ideally harmless<br>vexing that protects you against a<br>serious disease so that if you're even<br>to that you never even get sick so here<br>we've got a painting of the very first<br>vaccination that we have recorded in<br>1796 and this is Edward Jenner injecting<br>the son of his gun with some pus taken<br>from a cow pox mark from milkmaid there<br>are several different types of vaccines<br>and what he was doing is he was using a<br>live vaccine so he was putting alive and<br>fiction virus into this child and<br>luckily for everybody involved who's<br>actually protected from smallpox we also<br>use these killed or attenuated vaccines<br>so these are the microbe has been killed<br>or weakened in some way to reduce their<br>risk of causing disease however both of<br>these methods still actually are using<br>potentially infectious material they're<br>potentially allergic there's a very very<br>low risk but they do have them so with<br>the advent of molecular biology what<br>we've been able to do is focus down<br>exactly what the immune system is seeing<br>on these bacteria I've got an example<br>here we've got something on the bacteria<br>that the immune system is targeting and<br>that's what it uses to actually protect<br>you<br>so rather than needing to put in a whole<br>bacteria or a whole virus we can just<br>put in this single subunit in this one<br>that we talked about today so the<br>bacteria we're trying to protect you<br>against called<br>a streptococcus on yellow up here and it<br>causes this really really broad range of<br>disease some of which we would have all<br>had they're quite mild pharyngitis and<br>boutot go into these really quite rare<br>and nasty looking diseases such as<br>flesh-eating bug disease still has a<br>mortality around 70 to 80 percent even<br>today but what we're really concerned<br>about here in New Zealand is fact that<br>we have the dubious honor of having the<br>highest recorded rates of acute<br>rheumatic fever in the world and this is<br>almost solely focused in our Maori and<br>Pacific island children and what happens<br>with rheumatic fever is you get infected<br>with Group A streptococcus and it<br>several weeks later for some reason<br>which we don't understand and some<br>people the immune system goes haywire<br>and what it starts doing as it starts<br>attacking the heart and up here you can<br>see we've got a healthy heart I've just<br>pointed out at a normal heart valve this<br>is what opens and closes to pump blood<br>around your body and when the immune<br>system attacks it you essentially get<br>scar tissue forming on there it can't<br>open it can't close properly and a lot<br>of these patients will die from heart<br>failure before middle age so what we're<br>trying to use to protect these patients<br>from this is a protein called the T<br>antigen so here we have three bacteria<br>in the black and they're surrounded by<br>this fuzzy here like substance and these<br>are actually individual fibrils called<br>polite and just like our here is made of<br>a protein called keratin thus these pele<br>are made of several proteins and what<br>they have is that one in they've got an<br>anchor that holds them to the bacterial<br>cell wall net the other they have a<br>protein that sort of like a hand and<br>this is what the bacteria uses to lechon<br>to our cells<br>when it attacks us but in between is<br>this long thin fiber made out of one<br>protein repeated tens or hundreds of the<br>time so the immune system sees this<br>meaning anytime's and this is the<br>structure of one of those solved in 2007<br>shown here and biological structures are<br>important to us they show us atomic<br>level detail of these things it shows us<br>what they actually are and this tells us<br>about what they're doing and how they're<br>doing it and in this case how the immune<br>system is interacting with exits what's<br>most important<br>so the first step in designing a vaccine<br>is you need to know what you're actually<br>fighting what is out there and what does<br>your vaccine have to protect you from so<br>a few years ago a postdoc in our lab<br>sort of did a survey on all the types of<br>Group A streptococcus that were<br>circulating in Auckland as well as<br>overseas and the tight end this is a<br>genetic tree summarizing that work and<br>the key finding there is that group a<br>strep actually has 18 different types<br>there are 18 different streams what that<br>tells us that our vaccine has to protect<br>you against every one of those strains<br>so vaccine has to protect against 18<br>strains otherwise there's no point but<br>the second finding from this is that<br>that's important is that T one have<br>shown that brington purple that was<br>their structure I showed on the last<br>slide that's actually isolated<br>genetically it's it's off here on a<br>branch by itself whereas the majority of<br>them actually fall in this yellow<br>cluster so they're far more closely<br>related to each other than these guys<br>out here so for my work I have you been<br>using protein ringed in red called T 18<br>and that's a representative of this<br>yellow cluster so there also lets us<br>look at differences broad differences<br>between these so once we know what's out<br>there we need to know how the immune<br>system actually sees what's out there so<br>what I've done is we've vaccinated some<br>mice and a rabbit with protein called<br>g18 shown there and we there is a red<br>square the animal has a really strong<br>immune response to that protein so we've<br>done a blood test essentially against<br>this these different strains and what<br>you see is that there's a really strong<br>response to 218 our vaccine but there's<br>also a really strong response to a<br>couple of others say three and thirteen<br>and another 18 so what this tells us is<br>that mune system sees these in clusters<br>so we can give it one in trick it into<br>thinking it's actually seen for so what<br>for our vaccine design what this means<br>is we may not actually need 18 different<br>components in our vaccine to protect<br>against those 18 strains if we can<br>slipped a smaller number of key proteins<br>then they can each protect against 3 or<br>4 so that simplifies what we need to do<br>it for our vaccine<br>so the third step is we need to know<br>what our proteins that we're putting in<br>actually look like so we know what t1<br>looks like but that's quite separate we<br>don't know what any of these others look<br>like so to do this I'm using a method<br>called x-ray crystallography and this<br>involves crystallizing your proteins and<br>I've got a photo here down a microscope<br>of some of the protecta actual crystals<br>that I've made and we shoot this with a<br>very high-powered x-ray beam and when<br>this hits the crystal it diffracts and<br>is detected on a detector sort of<br>similar to old-fashioned film and the<br>pattern that these spots give you can<br>tell as it gives you information about<br>what's actually inside that crystal and<br>with some complicated maths that a<br>computer can do for us can actually give<br>us the atomic structure so this is what<br>I've done for the three proteins here<br>shown in the greens and the Blues and<br>these are all from that big yellow<br>cluster they're quite closely related<br>whereas the purple as this structure<br>solved in 2007 that's quite different<br>you don't need to know anything at all<br>about looking at biological molecules<br>you can quite clearly see that all of<br>these are incredibly similar if not<br>identical and this has made even more<br>remarkable because of the very low<br>sequence identity so this is a number<br>I've shown in arrows so this is telling<br>us about the similarity of the building<br>blocks that have been used to make these<br>so it's like we've given the purple<br>bacteria a handful of Lego blocks it's<br>built the structure and then you have<br>given the blue bacteria at the same<br>number of Lego blocks but only 38<br>percent of them are the same and yet<br>it's made a structure that is almost<br>identical so this tells us that this<br>shape is very very important to the<br>bacteria it needs this shape for<br>survival to keep that peles going to<br>keep that hand there to grasp onto<br>ourselves which also tells us that this<br>shape is not likely to change so it's<br>not likely to try and escape our vaccine<br>by changing the structure so we know<br>that they are actually very similar<br>despite being genetically quite<br>different so we want to know exactly<br>where these similarities are and where<br>the differences are so what we've been<br>looking at so far is cartoon images<br>which have been the skeletons of site<br>looking at me and only seeing bone and<br>that's shown in the ribbon and this<br>green protein but around it and the sort<br>of the transparency is a transparent<br>shell and that's<br>surface it's like looking at my skin so<br>that's what the immune system is<br>actually going to see from the outside<br>is a a text that's protein we've also<br>got a I'm comparing this to another<br>protein another t-antigen here and<br>anywhere this is green it has the exact<br>same building block as in this protein<br>on the left anywhere that it's blue the<br>building block is different so this is<br>showing us similarities and differences<br>on the surface that immune systems going<br>to see so when we expand this to cover<br>that whole tree all the diversity of<br>group a strip we can see that on all of<br>these are they being compared to t8n<br>down the bottom here we can see that on<br>all of these palade there are regions of<br>blue there are regions of difference<br>this is a genetic difference that<br>separates them into 18 strains that's<br>what we expect to see but most<br>importantly of all every single one of<br>these pillai has patches of green and<br>that means there's the same patch on<br>this pillow is the same as on this<br>pillow as the same as on this so if we<br>can train there or convince the immune<br>system to attack one of those green<br>places then you can particularly it<br>potentially protect against a very very<br>wide range of strains using a very very<br>small number of these proteins so how<br>does this all fit together what have we<br>done we've identified TNT diversity we<br>know what's out there we know how the<br>immune system sees what out there we've<br>solved the structures we know what our<br>vaccine is we know how this similar we<br>know how they're different what I'm<br>currently doing is looking at where<br>antibodies actually bind single<br>antibodies binding at the atomic level<br>and putting their into essays that are<br>testing whether those antibodies<br>actually kill anything whether they're</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
