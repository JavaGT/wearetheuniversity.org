It is based on reflective practice and the translation of biomedical theory to day-to-day medical work.<br><br>GENA820 provides a systematic review of the foundational concepts of medical practice; it aims to examine the academic and philosophic underpinning of modern medicine. http://bit.ly/2ygqYu7</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so I've done it - Oh which is nature<br>practice and then I'm doing it to three<br>now which is teaching and learning in<br>medicine there were definite days where<br>I find myself just feeling really good<br>about what I was doing being aware of my<br>contribution and where it's at rather<br>than sort of coping with the day-to-day<br>or of practice I was able to kind of<br>pull back and see the kind of worth of<br>what I was doing and feel really good<br>about it till my supposed to some degree<br>proud of it<br>there was a lot of flexibility with the<br>timing with there with the readings and<br>we've quite a bit of reading to do with<br>the 20 paper but it was all really<br>lovely it was all fascinating stuff and<br>so I really I looked forward to seeing<br>what the reading list was going to throw<br>up<br>for me to consider and then the<br>opportunity to talk about these things<br>with colleagues which quite frankly not<br>many of the colleagues my own practice<br>were interested in those things was just<br>a delight so there was very much a sense<br>of wish I'd done this sooner and and<br>certainly for the other participants in<br>the course who are like me fairly mature<br>compared to some of the participants who<br>were younger a sense of gosh it's really<br>good for them to be exposing themselves<br>to this information now and to be<br>sharing this experience with colleagues<br>and developing their understanding and<br>their appreciation of of their practice<br>and what they're about beyond do I<br>prescribe this medication and this for<br>this condition but where is it all set<br>what am I trying to do here am I just on<br>the hamster wheel seeing patient after<br>patient or is there a bit more to my<br>practice and idiot 20 paper has made me<br>feel very good about being a primary<br>health care worker about being a GP in</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
