you choose a peck of rice or an<br>ounce of democracy this slide shows an<br>extract of a poem written by a Myanmar<br>poet quartet entitled the dilemma the<br>burden of being Burma in this poem he<br>actually illustrates the dilemmas faced<br>by Myanmar citizens as they undergo<br>political and economic liberalization<br>since 2010 in the final line shown in<br>this x-ray Coco Tet highlights a key<br>dilemma there is faced by Myanmar<br>citizen that has undergoing that has<br>undergone liberalisation bias to<br>politically authoritarian is having a<br>back of rice to fit your family more<br>important or democracy my name is Wendy<br>and I'm from the Faculty of education<br>and social work my research seeks to<br>understand the how Myanmar you've<br>internalized these immigrants abilities<br>as well as incompatibilities in their<br>everyday life as the forces of change<br>pulls them in different directions now<br>everyone would have heard about the news<br>of the pie of the Rohingyas<br>in Myanmar Rohingyas are one of<br>Myanmar's many ethnic minority groups<br>but they are not recognized as any one<br>of the hundred and thirty-five ethnic<br>minorities in Myanmar they are they may<br>have stayed in Myanmar for generations<br>but they do not have citizenship and<br>they are referred to as Bengali Muslims<br>spider by D by De Palma this means that<br>they do not see them as an insider they<br>see them as a foreigner outside of this<br>country in 2015 the Myanmar government<br>actually had to retract the temporary<br>voting rights that were given to the row<br>hinges because of nationalist protests<br>by the buddhist recently what happen is<br>that Rohingyas militants actually attack<br>police post in northern Rakhine military<br>retaliation has actually<br>to a third of the population living the<br>country and this has created<br>humanitarian as well as refugee crisis<br>for the neighboring states of Malaysia<br>Thailand and Bangladesh there are fears<br>that the violence were actually<br>destabilize the region what this case<br>clearly illustrates are the challenges<br>as well as the dangers of fragility and<br>why fragility in Burma is a concern for<br>international development agencies and<br>its neighbors now the problem with stick<br>fragility fragile states are often<br>characterized by ongoing violence and<br>insecurity as well as weak governance<br>because the government is unable to<br>distribute public goods equitably or<br>efficiently there are also transnational<br>strategy conference arise from the<br>ongoing terrorism and violence as well<br>as humanitarian concerns<br>therefore Fukuyama actually said that<br>learn introduced state building better<br>is actually crucial to the world order<br>it is also crucial for the states that<br>surround Mima how then can the state be<br>built what many international<br>development agencies have done is to<br>build a state after its own image the<br>problem is that in doing so they<br>actually created many liberal democratic<br>institutions that followed the trend of<br>Western Europe this means liberal this<br>means actually having democratic<br>elections as well as creating market<br>economies but the problem is that this<br>State Building based on the Western<br>model have not created peace or<br>development in this global sovereign<br>states<br>now the question is who state has<br>lirikrip State Building created now<br>liberal State Building has actually<br>created this machine government machine<br>that is based on the structures and<br>institutions of the West but these<br>machines do not respond to the needs of<br>the local population<br>in fact the political structures created<br>are so alien to the local population<br>that they are we<br>jacquard by the local population as<br>something that is alien in the ugly<br>duckling the babies one is actually<br>rejected by the other ducklings and seen<br>as an ugly duckling even though he<br>eventually grows up to be a beautiful<br>swan similarly if Western structures are<br>super imposed on the states in the<br>global South with different traditions<br>no matter how good it may eventually<br>turn out to be<br>they will still be rejected by the local<br>therefore I argue that state building<br>should focus on the building of<br>political community rather than<br>governance machineries pistols forms of<br>state order may not be as efficient or<br>as strong as the institutions of the<br>West but at least they have the<br>legitimacy locally to take into account<br>local agency what I have done is to<br>conceptualize step on purchases as<br>hybrid political orders now what do<br>hybrid political orders mean this<br>picture shows the picture of months<br>associated with customs and traditions<br>using a laptop associated with modernity<br>what the idea of hybrid political order<br>can do is that it brings together the<br>idea of the liberal and the illiberal<br>the local and the international the<br>formal and the informal the modern and<br>the customary or in one space I am NOT<br>saying that customary actors and<br>institutions are necessarily better than<br>that of international institutions or<br>that of other groups but I am arguing<br>that if we want to focus on the state as<br>a political community local agency<br>cannot be not now<br>currently there are few empirical<br>studies using the concept of hybrid<br>political orders in the view of state<br>building and peacebuilding no empirical<br>study has actually applied the concept<br>of hybrid political orders to look at<br>identities and citizenship<br>my research project seeks to answer the<br>following question what does young<br>people's understandings of citizenship<br>and the everyday spaces where these<br>understandings are formed tell us about<br>the nature of and ways in which<br>citizenship is produced in hybrid<br>interestingly schools are typically seen<br>as the spacers where citizenship is<br>constructed but rather than focus on<br>schools I'm gonna focus on everyday<br>spaces if you take a look at the picture<br>it will show you a tailor shop in Yangon<br>on the table of this tailor shop you<br>will see this particular logo this is<br>the logo of the nice ex9 Buddhist<br>nationalist movement this logo basically<br>means that they actually these Buddhist<br>nationalist groups actually encourage<br>Buddhist to only visit and patronize<br>Buddhist shops in yen MA because the<br>mums actually claim that in most<br>Buddhist achieved patronized Muslim<br>shops were happiness that they would<br>endanger their race as well as their<br>religion now I'm going to show you some<br>snippets of Myanmar citizens comments on<br>the results raw anger crisis this is<br>what they said they are terrorists to<br>the native population they are expanding<br>he said they produced so many kids so<br>many children is better they go<br>somewhere else clearly what I am trying<br>to show you is that our everyday social<br>cultural spaces are also political<br>spaces that constructs our sense of<br>identity and citizenship it is the<br>interface between political structures<br>as well as social structures and these<br>spacers affect youth ideas of<br>citizenship now why is this important<br>many studies on citizenship actually<br>focus on the school context<br>but this study seeks to look at everyday<br>contacts and scholarship on the topic of<br>citizenship largely focused on<br>politically stable countries these<br>countries such as Myanmar which is<br>actually fragile and has a lot of<br>political instability and rarely<br>investigated this study also seeks to<br>address ethnocentrism there is in<br>scholarship on State Building and<br>basically seeks to connect to the agency<br>of local actors in addition by listening<br>to the voices of local actors I hope to<br>address the six the state centricity in<br>current literature on state building I<br>would like to conclude my presentation<br>with the extract of an interview from mr<br>x it is a local newspaper which<br>illustrate the challenges of citizenship<br>in Myanmar the idea of citizenship is<br>typically associated with ideas of<br>equality as well as democracy this is<br>what he said I am a Christian most of my<br>friends do not understand Christianity<br>they think it is a race this society<br>cannot distinguish between race and<br>religion I have to explain a lot there<br>is some confusion throughout generations<br>we have lived in Burma I think there is<br>why I became a citizens of Myanmar thank<br>you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
