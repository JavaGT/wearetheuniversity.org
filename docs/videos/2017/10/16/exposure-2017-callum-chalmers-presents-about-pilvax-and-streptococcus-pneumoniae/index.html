Jason love and this<br>is my project pelvics<br>a novel vaccine against pneumococcus now<br>you probably haven't heard of<br>pneumococcus but you probably have heard<br>of the three nasty infections which can<br>cause pneumonia and fiction of the lungs<br>meningitis infection of the brain and<br>infections of the bloodstream together<br>these infections kill more than 1.5<br>million children every year making<br>pneumococcus the number one cause of<br>child mortality more than 95 percent of<br>these deaths occur in the developing<br>world where a lack of resources makes it<br>extremely difficult to treat these<br>infections but what's more alarming is<br>more than 40% of these infections are<br>resistant to antibiotics making them<br>untreatable<br>and emphasizing the urgent need for an<br>effective vaccine against pneumococcus<br>because the only way to deal with these<br>infections which you can't treat is to<br>prevent them happening in the first<br>place now the reason I say effective<br>vaccine is because we in fact already<br>have two vaccines against pneumococcus<br>Pneumovax and Prevnar but as evidenced<br>by the still alarmingly high mortality<br>rates these vaccines are ineffectual and<br>that's because of the way they are<br>designed so a vaccine is made up of two<br>components the target or antigen<br>the danger signal or the edge of a-- so<br>the antigen tells the immune system what<br>to look for so the next time it<br>encounters that antigen it knows to make<br>a response and the adjuvant tells the<br>body that that antigen is dangerous and<br>it's something that it should respond to<br>and it's because of a poor choice of<br>both antigen and adjuvant that our<br>current vaccines fail to lessen the<br>burden of pneumococcus on our society so<br>first of all the antigen the antigen<br>that these vaccines use is capsular<br>polysaccharide which is a sticky coating<br>on the outside of the bacteria kind of<br>like the bacterias clothes but just like<br>we're all wearing different clothes<br>today each strain of pneumococcus has a<br>different capsule now there are over<br>ninety four different strains of<br>pneumococcus and therefore 94 different<br>capsules and currently the largest<br>vaccine only covers 30 of these capsules<br>meaning even vaccinated individuals are<br>vulnerable to a huge proportion of<br>pneumococcal disease in fact vaccinated<br>individuals have been shown to be more<br>susceptible to infection with the non<br>vaccine strains demonstrating how<br>ineffective our vaccines are now to the<br>edge of it the edge event they use is an<br>inactivated bacterial toxin which<br>creates a strong immune response but is<br>expensive to produce and couple to the<br>polysaccharide making it financially<br>inaccessible to the third world where it<br>is most desperately needed one vaccine<br>dose cost a hundred and thirty six<br>dollars which is more than half the<br>annual income of entire African family<br>demonstrating just how impossible it is<br>for these families to a fourth is<br>vaccine the end the edge of it also<br>needs to be constantly refrigerated<br>meaning some families have to travel<br>thousands of miles just to receive the<br>dose of this vaccine in third world<br>countries we refrigeration is not<br>readily available they have to make this<br>journey because they are desperate these<br>diseases kill one of their children<br>every 20 seconds and we mean to do<br>better for these families and that's<br>where my research comes in by changing<br>both the antigen and the edge event my<br>research aims to overcome the shortfalls<br>of our current vaccine and develop a<br>vaccine which can give these families<br>hope so how we're going to do this<br>first of all the antigen instead of<br>using that capsular polysaccharide I'm<br>using a protein called PSP a which as<br>you can see is present in all strains of<br>pneumococcus and it's highly conserved<br>if we go back to that clothing analogy<br>it's kind of like the tag no matter what<br>you're wearing all clothes have a tag<br>and my vaccine will protect against all<br>pneumococcal disease because I use this<br>PSP a now if we go to the adjuvant this<br>is where the real science comes in my<br>supervisor has devised a revolutionary<br>vaccine technology project as inbuilt<br>agency and it's cheap and easy to mass<br>produce making it ideal for use in the<br>third world<br>it's called pill vex and this is how it<br>works so just like humans are covered in<br>here bacteria are also covered in here<br>but unlike in humans their hair is not<br>just for decoration it acts kind of like<br>velcro to help the bacteria stick to<br>human cells and invade the body so the<br>hairs are called pillai and just like<br>human hair is made of keratin they are<br>made up of this protein called Spiro<br>want to act now pelvics works by<br>combining your antigen of interest with<br>that spire one to eight protein to<br>create pillai which express lots of that<br>antigen this is a highly stable<br>structure and because the surface is<br>covered in these pillai the antigen is<br>highly amplified and generates a strong<br>immune response and the bacteria itself<br>acts as the adjuvant to signal that the<br>antigen is dangerous but we use a<br>special bacteria called Lake Dukakis<br>which is actually the bacteria found in<br>yogurt and cheese and so it doesn't<br>cause you any harm and the vaccine is<br>totally safe now to demonstrate how<br>powerful this vaccine is this vaccine<br>technology I've got a graph here of our<br>pilot study on the y-axis I've got the<br>antibody titer which is just a measure<br>of the immune response and along the<br>x-axis I've got the three vaccines so if<br>you vaccinate with their antigen alone<br>you get no response because you need<br>that edge of Agenor eight an immune<br>response if you add a conventional edge<br>of n't you get our response but if you<br>vaccinate with pelvics you get a<br>response that is three logs higher which<br>is 1,000 times as potent demonstrating<br>just how powerful delivering antigens in<br>this way is<br>but not only is it powerful and totally<br>safe it's cheap and easy to mass-produce<br>and that's because we use live bacteria<br>now live bacteria can be frozen down<br>into this powder which can be easily<br>shipped and distributed it doesn't need<br>refrigeration it's lightweight it's<br>cheap and you can get it to those third<br>world countries where it's most needed<br>you just add water and the vaccine is<br>ready to go and what's even better is<br>the vaccine does not require any needles<br>it's delivered as a nasal spray so you<br>can just spritz it up your nose and<br>you're good to go<br>we've also tested delivering it orally<br>and it works just as effectively so in<br>the future it could be used through an<br>ice cream or a yogurt now don't tell me<br>that's not revolutionary so where am i<br>up to well there's two steps to this<br>project making the vaccine and testing<br>the vaccine so when you're making the<br>vaccine you are genetically modifying<br>that Pulis and that makes it harder for<br>the bacteria to Express so to determine<br>whether your vaccine is going to be<br>effective you have to measure the amount<br>of bacterial here on the surface so we<br>do that using fluorescence so I've got a<br>graph here on the y-axis I've got for<br>essence which is just a measure of that<br>bacterial here and along the bottom I've<br>got my four vaccine strains that I have<br>made and as you can see strain one and<br>strain three both expressed quite high<br>amounts of hair and I haven't been able<br>to get it to go any higher so now I'm<br>testing those strains in mice to measure<br>their immune response so for the last<br>two months I've been vaccinating mice<br>you give them three three doses every<br>fortnight and and next week I will be<br>measuring their immune response so I'm<br>very excited it's been a long time<br>coming to this and it's very exciting so<br>yeah watch the space but I'm not working<br>alone you heard a presentation from one<br>of my lab builders earlier tonight and<br>we're also working on vaccines against<br>influenza Group A streptococcus<br>infections like Jeremy was talking about<br>and staph infections so we've got a lot<br>of vaccines on the go and I'm very<br>privileged to be working in a libera a<br>lab where we're working at the forefront<br>of our field so I just like to thank all<br>my lab members for their contributions<br>to my research I'd like to thank the<br>University for funding this research<br>because without their funding we<br>couldn't do this groundbreaking research<br>and I'd like to thank exposure for<br>giving me the opportunity to share it<br>all with you tonight</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
