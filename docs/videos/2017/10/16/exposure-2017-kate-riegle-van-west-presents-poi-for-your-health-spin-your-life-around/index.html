generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>when I was growing up I was in the<br>circus and it was magic I could be<br>anyone I wanted to be in the circus oh I<br>could just be myself<br>and I loved flipping and flying through<br>the air and I loved being upside down<br>and standing on my hands and I loved<br>more than anything this pair of socks<br>it's true out of all the amazing cool<br>death-defying things you can do in the<br>circus I was enamored with this pair of<br>socks now you might not even recognize<br>what they are but they're actually POI<br>and they're one type of poi amongst many<br>because poi is practiced all over the<br>world so there's the Maori boy you may<br>be familiar with and that's where we<br>think all poi came from but there's also<br>play that glow and poi that you can<br>light on fire and there's those<br>unimpressive socks that I was introduced<br>to when I was in the circus little did I<br>know those socks were about to launch a<br>lifetime's worth of work and research<br>and discovery into orbit for the next<br>decade I did everything with my POI I<br>practiced poi standing on top of<br>shoulders and I played poi in the sea<br>I opened a center for POI where people<br>came together to learn and to share and<br>to play I created a musical instrument<br>Rou did employ that had accelerometers<br>and gyroscopes inside of a container<br>which I turned into poi and it sent data<br>to a computer about where it was in its<br>orbit and how fast it was going and that<br>data made music and I wrote an entire<br>master's thesis about that musical<br>instrument I've even given a TED talk<br>about poi now even after all that there<br>was one thing I never managed to do and<br>that was figure out why it felt so good<br>to do poi like why was I so obsessed<br>with this thing and I kind of knew why<br>for my own personal self like I kind of<br>knew I felt good to me and other people<br>kind of knew I felt good to them but<br>that's not what I was interested in I<br>wanted to know why objectively<br>fundamentally the act of taking a chord<br>with a weight on end of it and spinning<br>it in a circle like why did that feel so<br>good<br>and that's when I realized there was no<br>systematic scientific research on poi<br>none and so I dropped everything I moved<br>from the US run from here to New Zealand<br>for the past two and a half years I've<br>been working between the Center for<br>brain research and the dance department<br>to conduct the first scientific study on<br>POI so I'm working with healthy older<br>adults people over 60 years old and I'm<br>actually measuring physical cognitive<br>and emotional health the effects of POI<br>on those things now even if you cannot<br>imagine twirling a sock around you and<br>even if you are not over 60 this<br>research still concerns you why because<br>you're getting old but don't worry do<br>not fret you are not alone globally the<br>number of people over 60 is expected to<br>more than double in the next 30 years<br>and a big reason for this is because<br>we're living longer but that does not<br>mean we necessarily have good quality of<br>life in our later years quality of life<br>affects not only your individual life<br>but what you can contribute to your<br>family to your local community to<br>society at large and it also is putting<br>a huge burden on the health care system<br>because more and more people are living<br>longer and they're living with chronic<br>disease and they're dependent on the<br>healthcare system to treat and prevent<br>that disease simple and effective<br>strategies and affordable strategies for<br>maintaining our health and old-age are<br>really urgently needed so how much can a<br>sock help well I put 79 participants to<br>the test and I measured all sorts of<br>physical cognitive and emotional things<br>like the ones that you see here that's<br>some upper limb range of motion<br>dexterity in the hand coordination<br>between the two hands lower body<br>strength<br>there's also cognitive and emotional<br>things but they're really boring to look<br>at because it was just someone sitting<br>at a computer so I didn't include this<br>they were there I did two baseline<br>measurements a month apart to establish<br>that baseline and then my participants<br>got to play so they were randomly<br>allocated to either practice poi or<br>tight<br>the reason for having a group doing<br>Taichi it's because I need a control<br>group something to compare poi to that's<br>appropriate for healthy older adults and<br>has scientific research proving its<br>efficacy so tai chi is certainly that<br>has been proven to improve balance and<br>cardiovascular function in healthy older<br>adults so my participants got to play<br>for twice a week for one month and then<br>they went back to the clinics and they<br>repeated all those same tests over again<br>now when comparing the data from after<br>the lessons to the data from before the<br>lessons both groups improved their<br>balance their grip strength their memory<br>and their attention the Tai Chi group<br>also dropped their blood pressure these<br>are SuperDuper exciting results first<br>thing they're consistent with previous<br>research on Tai Chi and that's very<br>important if my Tai Chi group did it<br>improve their balance and their<br>cardiovascular function maybe something<br>went wrong with my study because every<br>other well almost every other study on<br>Tai Chi has proven this so it's<br>consistent with previous research on Tai<br>Chi but the really exciting thing is<br>that poi improved right alongside and<br>when you think about these things<br>balance grip strength memory and<br>attention they're so important for<br>quality of life maintaining these things<br>could be the difference between your<br>independence and a nursing home so now<br>only did I gather all this great data<br>I was asking participants questions<br>about how they felt all along the way as<br>well so one thing I did was after each<br>and every lesson I asked them to write<br>down the words which best described how<br>they were feeling and I compiled these<br>words so here you see just the poi<br>participants responses the bigger words<br>are the words that were said the most so<br>for the poi drop the three words that<br>were said the most were relaxed<br>challenged and happy for the Tai Chi<br>group it was relaxed calm and peaceful<br>so this tells us not only about the<br>participants experience but also some<br>similarities and differences between Po<br>and Tai Chi which could be helpful for<br>future research and I was also asking<br>some more in-depth questions all along<br>the way and I'll share just a few of<br>those answers with you so these are just<br>from the ploy participants a lot of<br>people mention a flexibility or<br>looseness<br>in their body this person mentions<br>they're back in their shoulders and<br>their neck a lot of people mentioned the<br>challenge of poi and how great it was to<br>learn a new skill this person said I<br>felt good learning a new skill it was<br>challenging and I felt myself improving<br>in some moves which I thought I'd never<br>ever be able to do I heard a lot of<br>participants especially talk about being<br>older all my participants were over 60<br>trying something new at that stage was<br>really great for them and they really<br>enjoyed the challenge and lastly a lot<br>of people had fun got a sense of<br>enjoyment from it so I've got all this<br>great data about how people felt that<br>supports this other data that I measured<br>in those clinics now what well you never<br>do know we're spinning sock is going to<br>take you but I do hope that this<br>research will pave the way for future<br>research on poi and health<br>I think this research can have huge<br>implications for quality of life which<br>will not only improve your individual<br>life but what you can contribute to<br>society and hopefully alleviate some of<br>that pressure on the healthcare system<br>poi is such a simple inexpensive fun<br>customisable tool I could imagine this<br>research leading to all sorts of other<br>research studies from youth to older<br>adults<br>I could imagine studying ADHD depression<br>early onset dementia stroke I could also<br>imagine this research having huge<br>implications in Maori 'dom not because<br>I'm going to tell Maori something they<br>don't already know about POI but just to<br>shed new light on one of their own Tonga<br>I think the study is just the tip of a<br>huge iceberg as Tom Robin says if you<br>take any art any activity any skill any<br>discipline if you take it and push it as<br>far as it will go push it to the wildest<br>edge of edges then you force it into the<br>realm of magic when I was growing up and<br>I was in the circus it was magic and to<br>be honest with you I've never grown up<br>I'm still following my dreams and<br>chasing my passions and pushing POI as<br>far as it will go and even though I hope<br>to remain forever young at heart I know<br>we're all growing older<br>and simple and effective and affordable<br>strategies for maintaining quality of<br>life in old age are urgently needed I<br>think it's time to put a new spin on<br>aging and for the world to follow New<br>Zealand back to the practice of poi and<br>forward to a healthier future thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
