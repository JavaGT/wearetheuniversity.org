networks structures like this<br>with nodes and edges edges are the lines<br>that connect to nodes<br>whenever we want to analyze any sort of<br>connectivity and network like this is<br>the perfect model we can model people<br>and their relationships using networks<br>where nodes are the people and if two<br>people know each other we connect we<br>connect them using an edge we can also<br>model friends and enemies using them<br>using a network with positive and<br>negative edges in a network like this an<br>essential question is whether enemy of<br>an enemy is a friend this seemingly easy<br>question is fundamental in understanding<br>the implications of positive and<br>negative interactions that go beyond the<br>social context in this network enemy of<br>an enemy is a friend and we call it a<br>balanced Network however in many cases<br>we're dealing with networks like this<br>one on the right that is not balanced<br>but an interesting observation here is<br>that there are only a few edges that can<br>be removed to make the network balance<br>in here if we can somehow destroy the<br>friendship between Sara and George then<br>the network becomes balanced we call the<br>edges that needs to be removed<br>frustrated edges but the problem is that<br>a per size analysis of many of these<br>networks is not feasible due to the<br>computational complexity that is beyond<br>our most advanced technologies to put<br>that into perspective and in rating the<br>solutions for a network like this takes<br>hundreds of years on the world's most<br>powerful supercomputer running full<br>speed in order to find the frustrated<br>edges we can color the nodes using black<br>and white then a frustrated edge<br>is either a positive age with different<br>endpoint colors or a negative edge with<br>the same color on the endpoints this way<br>we can look for him for a note coloring<br>that minimizes the total number of<br>frustrated ages if we represent the<br>number of nodes with n then there are<br>two to the N possible colorings that is<br>our problem space in this network we can<br>color the nodes like this<br>which leads to one frustrated age but<br>finding the optimal solution in<br>non-trivial examples is not easy<br>suppose that the three-dimensional space<br>of this lecture theater is our problem<br>space then finding the optimal solution<br>is as difficult as hitting a static<br>invisible target that can be potentially<br>anywhere in this lecture theater let's<br>see some real examples here is a network<br>of New Guinean tribes and their positive<br>and negative relationships the green and<br>red edges represents alliances and<br>enmities between these tribes in here we<br>have 16 nodes therefore there are 2 to<br>the 16 possible cases that needs to be<br>checked by the computer here is another<br>network representing a group of monks<br>and their positive and negative<br>relationships in here we have 18 nodes<br>therefore there are 2 to the 18 possible<br>cases so when we increase the number of<br>nodes by 2 then the number of cases to<br>be checked will be increased by 200,000<br>this phenomenon is what we call<br>computational complexity many<br>researchers in the past have attempted<br>solving this problem in very small<br>scales like their problem space size of<br>a shoebox their algorithms are based on<br>a random search this is like throwing a<br>bouncy ball with infinite energy into a<br>random direction as it bounces back<br>whenever it hits a target it whenever it<br>hits a wall it will eventually hit the<br>target but these random search<br>algorithms are not practical for a<br>problem space larger than size of a<br>shoebox<br>here we have 329 notes which means that<br>we are dealing with a number so enormous<br>that I can't even pronounce its name my<br>research looks ahead to the extreme<br>limits of solving hard optimization<br>problems where enumerated the solution<br>takes hundreds of years we didn't have a<br>hundred years but we had a determination<br>to tame the complexity and solve these<br>problems in large networks like this<br>which represents the interaction map of<br>a white blood cell so we decided to<br>start with three years of thinking<br>simulating and experimenting in the hope<br>of getting some discount on the<br>remaining 97 years in these three years<br>we discovered and took advantage of the<br>hidden structures of these networks we<br>have successfully restricted the problem<br>space into a cone-shaped structure now<br>if we throw the bouncy ball into the<br>cone it converges and hits the target<br>very fast<br>our main achievement is that using a<br>standard university issued computer our<br>algorithm can otherwise very large<br>networks in a few minutes<br>besides making new computations possible<br>or algorithm is the only one that comes<br>with a guarantee of solution quality<br>this is equivalent to building a machine<br>that checks and verify something much<br>greater than the number of atoms in the<br>universe let's see some other examples<br>here is a portfolio of 11 investments<br>the green and red edges represents<br>positive and negative correlations<br>between these investments financial<br>experts come up with these portfolios<br>that have a good performance under<br>different market conditions and our<br>algorithm provides a measure of<br>predictability that explains their<br>performance here is a fullerene a<br>molecule made of carbon atoms fullerenes<br>are closely related to carbon nanotubes<br>that have very interesting properties<br>compared to steel they are 10 times<br>stronger and six times lighter this<br>inspires<br>thinking about advanced materials for<br>building bridges and airplanes in the<br>future they also have fascinating<br>electrical properties that that leads to<br>the idea of making nano wires but there<br>are many challenges involving the<br>chemical stability of fullerenes that is<br>yet unknown to us even after multiple<br>Nobel prize-winning discoveries in this<br>field well the output of our algorithm<br>provides a measure of predictable a<br>measure of chemical stability for a<br>fullerene graph that was thought to be<br>impossible to compute here as here is an<br>example from physics a model<br>representing patterns of atomic magnets<br>in a model like this an essential<br>concept is the minimum energy state<br>which can be computed using or algorithm<br>so is it just another high-performance<br>algorithm no this is a game-changer in<br>many fields of research we can now<br>better understand the interactions among<br>numerous genes or gain valuable insights<br>on the energy of magnets and stability<br>of nanomaterials this also allows us to<br>answer essential questions in business<br>like the predictability of a financial<br>portfolio here we have a network of<br>positive and negative international<br>relations between countries using the<br>algorithm we can now simulate numerous<br>scenarios leading to polarization of<br>countries this is essential in<br>preventing a cold war
