Jason<br>loan and what we're interested in in our<br>lab group and with my research in<br>particular is looking at whether or not<br>we can use these hairy bacteria that we<br>find in the wild as the basis for<br>vaccine development so just to put this<br>into a bit of context I thought I talked<br>a bit about vaccines to start off with<br>so there's many diseases out there where<br>there's absolutely no vaccine available<br>and what that means is we can't prevent<br>these diseases whether or not that<br>disease as a major exotic disease you<br>hear about on the news like Ebola or<br>malaria or something a lot closer to<br>home something much more familiar like a<br>sore throat or a skin infection we can't<br>prevent any of those diseases so why<br>would we want to well aside from the<br>fact that nobody really wants their<br>throat looking like that because it<br>looks incredibly painful vaccines are<br>the most cost effective and efficient<br>way of treating and preventing a disease<br>within a community they're so successful<br>that they're actually able to eradicate<br>diseases you would have only heard about<br>smallpox in a historical context a<br>successful worldwide vaccination program<br>eradicated that disease from the face of<br>the earth another thing you might have<br>heard about is rising antibiotic<br>resistance and what that means is that a<br>lot of these diseases are no longer able<br>to be treated with antibiotics so what<br>that means and in terms of in terms of<br>treatment sorry is that it's a lot<br>better to prevent these things since<br>they actually have to treat them<br>especially when we have no options left<br>so in fact things themselves have<br>developed quite significantly over time<br>the first vaccines were essentially live<br>pathogenic pathogens that were put into<br>people and as you can imagine injecting<br>people with live pathogens as in a<br>particularly great idea so we've learned<br>quite a bit since the 1700s we've<br>learned you don't need the pathogen to<br>be full strength you can give it a bit<br>of a kick in the guts and weaken it so<br>that the body is more guaranteed to<br>overcome it and we see this in<br>modern-day vaccines with the measles<br>mumps rubella vaccine as well as the<br>chickenpox vaccine we've also learned a<br>little bit more we've learnt we don't<br>need the whole bacteria at all we can<br>just use a portion of it and we can use<br>a protein found on the surface and we<br>see that in subunit vaccines like with<br>the hepatitis B vaccine we can take that<br>another step further we don't even need<br>the whole protein we can use just a<br>small section of that protein and that's<br>called a peptide<br>and peptide vaccines are at the leading<br>forefront of modern vaccine research so<br>peptide vaccines offer a number of major<br>advantages the fact that there's<br>absolutely no one fixed material<br>involved because it is just a small<br>portion of a protein we're able to<br>specifically target the immune response<br>with this a very small peptide and<br>because it's such a small amount of<br>foreign material there's a very little<br>risk of allergic reaction now like<br>everything peptides do come with a bit<br>of baggage there are some disadvantages<br>so peptides the biggest disadvantage<br>they don't actually do anything there's<br>no response in the body the body ignores<br>it and basically disposes it into the<br>rubbish because of us to get a response<br>other previous peptide vaccines have<br>combined these peptides with potentially<br>toxic products and these are expensive<br>and its cost is always a factor and<br>modern medical development so to<br>overcome this the process we're planning<br>to do in our lab is using bacteria so<br>there are good bacteria and there are<br>bad bacteria and the fact that our<br>bodies contain ten times more bacterial<br>cells than our own it's probably a good<br>thing that there are some good ones out<br>there so we find a lot of these good<br>ones and food products like dairy<br>products we find this one called lactic<br>Kaka selectors and he becomes important<br>later on here's a friendly bacteria he's<br>not going to cause us any harm there's<br>also bad ones we see this in the ones<br>that causes the sore throat the Group A<br>streptococcus and as you can see he's<br>got these hairlike projections coming<br>off the surface of his cell he's going a<br>little bit bald but he's got this<br>hairlike projections so when we look<br>down the microscope do we see these<br>hairy bacteria at all well it's actually<br>a little bit more boring bacteria looked<br>like this on the microscope and what we<br>see is there's hairlike projections<br>protruding from the surface of the cell<br>and these are called pillow and what<br>they are are essentially little arms and<br>hands reaching out to grab onto the body<br>to help them adhere to us and make it<br>harder for the body to remove them now<br>this pathogenic bacteria has this pillow<br>and if we take a closer look at these<br>pillow we see that they're essentially<br>just one building block repeated over<br>and over again<br>now the body knows this building block<br>has seen it a lot of times in the past<br>it's learned that this building block is<br>bad for us so it mounts an immune<br>response so if we contain our peptide<br>within that building block you can see<br>that our peptide is now all over the<br>building block of the protex are all<br>over the pillars<br>and because we're getting an immune<br>response to the building block our<br>peptide gets caught in the crossfire<br>and we get a response to that peptide<br>which overcomes that disadvantage of<br>peptides not doing anything so to put<br>this into a more elegant picture<br>basically what we've done is we've taken<br>the gene responsible for this hairlike<br>structure for this pillars we've<br>modified it a little bit so that now a<br>peptide of interest is contained within<br>that pillars because we can't administer<br>of a vaccine and a pathogenic bacteria<br>we have to take it out of the bad<br>bacteria and put it into the friendly<br>one that's lacked Akaka selectors that<br>we find in dairy products and so what we<br>get we get this friendly bacteria that's<br>now expressing these immuno genic<br>hairlike projections with our peptide of<br>interest and we've called those pill<br>backs<br>short for peles vaccine and if we go<br>back to our advantages and disadvantages<br>of peptide vaccines and think about it<br>in the context of pelvics what we now<br>have is most of these disadvantages<br>basically removed by putting our peptide<br>in their demeanor genetic structure<br>we're now getting an immune response and<br>it's also protected from degradation<br>within the body and we no longer need to<br>couple it to anything else we also get a<br>number of extra advantages so bacteria<br>are very cheap and very easy to grow so<br>like I said earlier cost is always a<br>factor and that is why this is such a<br>major advantage another major advantage<br>is that most vaccines at the moment<br>they're delivered with needles a lot of<br>people don't like needles I'm a little<br>bit of younger myself but because this<br>bacteria is found within food products<br>we have the potential to put it into<br>food products so imagine being able to<br>go down to Queen Street after this maybe<br>treat yourself to some ice cream and get<br>vaccinated just by eating that ice cream<br>it'll be the most delicious vaccine<br>you've ever had to guarantee that one so<br>we know that this works this is an all<br>talking theory we've carried out a pilot<br>study within our lab group and that<br>pilot studies shows that this works so<br>on the y-axis what we have is a level of<br>antibody response and mice that have<br>been immunized and on the x-axis it's<br>just the different controls that we<br>carried out so the first column where<br>there's no response is just where we've<br>contained vaccinated mice with our<br>peptide our test peptide put over and<br>over as you will expect as a peptide it<br>doesn't cause any response so we don't<br>see any antibodies<br>whatsoever our next column the blue one<br>is out over peptide contained within the<br>pillbox construct and what we get is a<br>reasonable antibody response now the the<br>third one the green one is our positive<br>control in a sense so it's our peptide<br>immunized with cholera toxin B which is<br>a more traditional edge of it they've<br>been mixed together and we've immunized<br>mice with that mix and we do get a<br>reasonable antibody response to that as<br>well<br>the reason the pill vex one is a lot<br>more exciting and a lot better as<br>because the pill vex construct contains<br>10,000 times less peptide and as I said<br>earlier the less foreign material put<br>into the body the better it is so this<br>comes along to the aims of the rest of<br>the aims of my project and what we're<br>looking at is whether or not we can use<br>this construct and models of infectious<br>disease we've want to pull apart the<br>immune responses that we get we want to<br>see what cell types are involved and<br>what directions are involved between<br>those cells and we also want to see if<br>we're able to offer protection with this<br>vaccine so the disease we've chosen to<br>target is mycobacteria tuberculosis and<br>that's been described by the World<br>Health Organization as a global health<br>emergency and they're not just being<br>dramatic when they say that this<br>bacteria has killed more people than any<br>other bacteria in the history of<br>humankind so it's quite a significant<br>threat to human health this is all<br>despite the fact that there is a current<br>vaccine available the BCG vaccine but<br>it's largely ineffective and the New<br>Zealand Ministry of Health no longer<br>prescribes this on the vaccine schedule<br>because it is rather controversial as to<br>whether or not it works so how we're<br>going to target mycobacteria<br>tuberculosis is by targeting this<br>protein that's a set six protein now the<br>name not particularly important but it<br>stands for early secreted antigen and<br>the six just indicates the size of the<br>protein so what this protein does is<br>it's essential for virulence if you take<br>this protein away from the bacteria it's<br>no longer able to cause any sort of<br>disease in humans so if we can target<br>this protein and prevent it from having<br>any effect perhaps we can prevent this<br>bacteria from being able to cause<br>disease in us so because this is a<br>peptide based process we're targeting<br>three portions of this protein these<br>three peptides circled here and why<br>we're targeting these three peptides is<br>because in the real life situation these<br>are the three areas of the protein that<br>are exposed to the immune system the<br>spirally bits in the middle those are<br>heading away with animal cell membrane<br>so we're not actually going to have the<br>immune<br>system seeing those in a real-life<br>situation so there's no point targeting<br>them now where this project is that is<br>in a very watch this space<br>in terms of in terms of progress we've<br>got a lot of very exciting future work<br>ahead of us with our collaborators dr.<br>Joanna Coleman and her lab group at the<br>University of Otago and down there we're<br>going to vaccinate mice with our three<br>pullbacks constructs and we're going to<br>pull apart the immune response we're<br>going to see what the cell types are<br>doing all the different cell types of<br>the immune system all the different<br>signaling molecules and really see<br>what's going on if this vaccine is<br>effective and eventually able to<br>determine it for office protection so<br>finally I'd just like to acknowledge my<br>lab group for all their help and support<br>as well as our collaborators at the<br>University of Otago and
