professor<br>i have to remind the audience that the<br>rank of professor is the pinnacle of<br>academic achievement at the university<br>of otago and it is only achieved by a<br>handful of people<br>who demonstrate excellence in teaching<br>in research and in service to the<br>profession and to the community<br>now as you will soon learn<br>from margaret's lecture she is an<br>internationally recognized expert in<br>criminal law and the law of relationship<br>property<br>she is also a gifted teacher and she<br>provides outstanding service both to the<br>university of otago as well as to her<br>profession<br>her research is not only cutting edge<br>but it has also made an incredible<br>contribution to the judiciary<br>now we've known these things about<br>margaret for a long time<br>but in order to promote her to professor<br>we also sought advice from<br>international experts in her area of<br>research<br>and when we did we heard things like<br>associate professor briggs writes<br>superbly even on difficult technical<br>subjects<br>her writing is always clear<br>economical yet with a nice turn of<br>phrase to make her point<br>it is actually rare that one finds such<br>excellent writing even amongst both most<br>very senior academics<br>we also heard about her outstanding<br>scholarship<br>one of her referees said<br>margaret briggs demonstrates time and<br>time again in her work on relationship<br>property her command of history<br>legislative developments policy issues<br>underlying statutory interpretation and<br>judicial developments<br>all the while keeping a critical eye on<br>the practical legal outcomes of her work<br>and on her career as a whole we heard<br>this is the work of a mature<br>self-assured scholar sustained at an<br>outstanding level over many many years<br>internationally she is well recognized<br>as an expert in her<br>field well all of these comments simply<br>confirmed what we already knew about<br>margaret<br>so professor briggs on behalf of the<br>university of otago i would like to<br>warmly welcome you to give your<br>inaugural professorial lecture and to<br>congratulate you on your

tonight to give<br>your inaugural profitable lecture on a<br>topic i know that's close to your heart<br>criminal attempts how close is too close<br>please give margaret a big welcome<br>can you hear me<br>vice chancellor professor hennigan thank<br>you very much for that fullsome<br>introduction<br>uh however i am reasonably certain that<br>i have yet to meet the person that you<br>have just been describing<br>uh unfortunately in her absence i'm<br>afraid that you may have to make do with<br>me this evening<br>so on that cautionary note i will begin<br>the invitation to deliver this lecture<br>is accompanied by<br>a list of guidelines one of which is<br>that we trace our research journey from<br>whence we began to where we are now<br>for me as you have already heard that<br>journey first began when i was an<br>undergraduate student at this law<br>faculty in the 1980s<br>even then two areas of the law were of<br>particular significance and interest to<br>me and they were criminal law and family<br>law or more specifically the<br>relationship property aspects of family<br>law and you might ask well why those two<br>disparate areas in particular<br>well i suppose i've always been drawn to<br>those sorts of legal relationships<br>where there is the whiff of a power<br>imbalance where there is a disadvantaged<br>party pitted against a party who holds<br>more of the bargaining chips<br>and although we might say that power<br>imbalance is a predictable feature of<br>most parts of the law it is pronouncedly<br>the case in criminal law and also to a<br>fair degree in family property law<br>my curiosity in those two subjects was<br>sparked when i was a student by two<br>lecturers in particular mark hennigan<br>who taught and continues to teach family<br>law<br>and<br>and professor kevin dawkins who until<br>his retirement earlier this year taught<br>criminal law<br>and it was clear to us as students that<br>they both possessed encyclopedic<br>understanding of their disciplines<br>and in their very individual ways they<br>conveyed to us<br>an evangelical zeal for what they taught<br>and so i was an easy convert<br>maybe not on the road to damascus but<br>vice chancellor next best thing banks of<br>so after graduating as you've heard<br>following a very brief stint in practice<br>i returned to the faculty<br>and to cut the story short i've never<br>left<br>and in the time i have been here i<br>really do regard myself as fortunate to<br>have been able to pursue my dual<br>research interests in criminal law and<br>family property law<br>and along the way i have had the<br>privilege of working alongside many<br>inspirational colleagues many of whom<br>are here tonight<br>so now to my explanation for my choice<br>of topic for this lecture<br>when i returned to the faculty in 1989<br>the first block of teaching ever<br>assigned to me<br>as an assistant lecturer was in criminal<br>law<br>and it was on the subject of the crime<br>of attempt<br>and preparing those lectures opened my<br>eyes to the wide range of conceptual and<br>really largely intractable challenges<br>raised by attempts<br>so much so that this facet of the<br>criminal law has become one of my<br>enduring research interests<br>so out of all the things i could have<br>talked about this evening i have decided<br>to take you back to my very roots and<br>tell you<br>how one microcosm of the law of attempt<br>has evolved since i first became<br>interested in it all those years ago<br>and so now to the main course<br>well the criminal law is engaged in a<br>great many line drawing exercises<br>and one that can present real challenges<br>is locating the point at which a<br>person's conduct passes from<br>mere<br>non-criminal preparation to a fully<br>fledged attempt to commit an offence<br>the law does not as a general rule<br>criminalize a person's early acts of<br>preparing to commit an offence<br>but if those acts get close enough to<br>the full offence they are said to be an<br>attempt and attempts are criminalized<br>so identifying the minimum conduct for<br>an attempt is therefore crucial because<br>it marks the first point at which a<br>person can be held responsible for their<br>actions<br>now of course in many cases there is no<br>problem at all in identifying a fully<br>fledged attempt so for example the actor<br>who fires the gun with murderous intent<br>but who misses or merely injures the<br>victim is clearly guilty of attempted<br>murder<br>but the cases that cause the problems<br>are those where the actors conduct stop<br>the current statutory formulation of<br>what amounts to a criminal attempt is<br>found in section 72 of the crimes act<br>and from that provision we can determine<br>several things<br>first of all from subsection one we can<br>determine that in order to be guilty of<br>an attempt<br>the person must first of all intend to<br>commit the offence whatever that offence<br>might be it might be theft it might be<br>kidnapping it might be murder and so on<br>but in addition to that intention we are<br>told that the person must also do an act<br>for the purpose of accomplishing their<br>object<br>secondly subsection two tells us however<br>that not all acts will qualify<br>acts that are merely preparatory are<br>described as too remote to constitute an<br>attempt<br>and we're also told that there is a<br>question of law for the judge to<br>determine<br>thirdly<br>we are told that acts that are<br>immediately or proximately connected<br>with the intended offence may constitute<br>an attempt<br>now those words immediately<br>approximately connected in subsection 3<br>suggest that the conduct must be fairly<br>close to the full offence<br>whether in terms of time or physical<br>location or both we are not told but the<br>implication is clearly there that the<br>actor's conduct ought to be somewhere in<br>the home stretch<br>lastly if we combine the wording of<br>subsections two and three<br>we can tell that a line is to be drawn<br>between<br>non-criminal preparation<br>and a criminal attempt but<br>we are not told where exactly to draw it<br>and that is where the courts must<br>provide us with judicial insight into<br>the words of the provision<br>historically however no single judicial<br>gloss<br>has coped particularly well with the<br>very complex matrix of different<br>offences<br>and different fact scenarios that have<br>come before the courts<br>and so finding the dividing line in any<br>given case can depend very much on the<br>type of offence involved<br>and what the acts are that the defendant<br>is alleged to have committed<br>so for example an attempted fraud will<br>comprise a very different set of steps<br>to an attempted murder<br>but of course abstract talk takes us<br>only so far and so i'm now going to<br>outline four cases which i hope will<br>demonstrate the changes that have taken<br>place in the law of attempt in the time<br>that i have been researching in the<br>field<br>until 2010<br>the<br>1982 court of appeal case of wilcox had<br>dominated the attempt landscape and<br>judicial thinking about a tent in new<br>zealand for almost three decades<br>and this was certainly the case that i<br>cut my teeth on both as a student and<br>when i began researching and teaching in<br>the area<br>wilcox concerned an attempted aggravated<br>robbery of a post office<br>wilcox and his accomplices had performed<br>a number of acts in pursuance of their<br>plan<br>they had made several purchases they had<br>purchased balaclavas with which to<br>conceal their identities<br>and they had purchased some air rifles<br>and pallets to point at the unfortunate<br>bank staff<br>they had then loaded the rifles and set<br>off in a car towards their destination<br>which was about three miles distant<br>however<br>the police who had been informed about<br>the plan<br>stopped the car when it was about one<br>mile from the post office now<br>the deceptively simple question in that<br>case was<br>when those men were stopped in that car<br>had they done enough to amount to<br>attempted aggravated robbery or to put<br>it another way<br>were they already committing an<br>attempted aggravated robbery when they<br>were stopped<br>now were i to ask you for a show of<br>hands i'm not but were i to ask you<br>for a show of hands on that question i<br>suspect that there would be no unanimity<br>among you on the contrary i think that<br>you would hold a range of different<br>views on where the preparatory steps<br>finished<br>and the proximate conduct began if at<br>all on that three mile journey<br>well what did the court think in this<br>case well<br>the court of appeal<br>held that willcox's actions had not gone<br>beyond preparation so that means no<br>attempt<br>and the court made a number of<br>significant findings<br>it said that when the police stopped the<br>car the men were doing no more than<br>getting themselves to a physical<br>location close to the post office from<br>which an attempt could then be launched<br>in other words there was as yet no<br>commencement of execution or step in the<br>actual commission of the crime itself<br>and the court also said that it was<br>important to give separate consideration<br>first of all to the men's intention to<br>commit the crime<br>and secondly<br>to the physical actions that they had<br>done in pursuance of their intentions<br>so then even if there is proof of a<br>person's bad intentions<br>they may not yet have performed enough<br>significant actions<br>to translate those<br>intentions<br>into a fully fledged attempt<br>the wilcox reasoning was applied<br>regularly in subsequent decisions<br>and for some time i assumed that this<br>part of the law of attempt was fairly<br>settled and reasonably dormant<br>but wilcox did not find universal<br>support and there were occasional<br>rumblings that the approach was somewhat<br>artificial<br>rather too defendant friendly<br>and could result in the police having to<br>wait until matters had reached a<br>and the first warning signs of an<br>impending change<br>came with the case of barret<br>where the high court judge was openly<br>critical of wilcox<br>now bharat was decided in 2003<br>and some of you may even remember the<br>case hitting the news headlines at the<br>time<br>and the photograph on the slide is a<br>photograph of the protagonist mr barrett<br>and i think it is possibly a photograph<br>of himself leading his own defense in<br>the trial in court<br>the case concerned and this may start<br>ringing some bowels the case concerned<br>the attempted kidnapping of a wealthy<br>wellington businessman later revealed to<br>be bill trotter<br>son of the former fletcher challenge<br>chairman saron trotter<br>and the would-be kidnappers had gone to<br>some considerable lengths to accommodate<br>their special guest<br>they had dug an underground bunker of no<br>small proportions for him<br>in the rimutaka forest park and they<br>were planning to hide him in that bunker<br>until the trotter family paid some<br>outrageous ransom<br>and they were not entirely insensitive<br>to his plight<br>they had provided him with a modicum of<br>home comforts they had equipped the<br>bunker with an ensuite and an air<br>ventilation system<br>and they had stalked it with various<br>pantry items<br>and griffin's crispy biscuits no doubt<br>lest he should feel like having a little<br>solo celebration while down there<br>and<br>that first slide there that you will see<br>is a pan shot of the bunker to the left<br>you'll see the rather rudimentary toilet<br>to the right which is to the right at<br>the upper corner is the air ventilation<br>system<br>and you will not see the writing on the<br>wall but i will read it to you<br>it says welcome to to your new home<br>maximum stay six days we will not hurt<br>you<br>they rather thoughtfully<br>provided<br>instructions on how to operate the<br>ventilation system<br>lester's suffocate and they did not get<br>their ransom<br>however their plan was never put to the<br>test because their efforts were in vain<br>because the police had discovered what<br>was happening and they had been watching<br>the men for several days before<br>arresting them on the day of the attempt<br>and the police caught them near the<br>entrance to the wellington botanical<br>gardens<br>just a few hundred metres from the<br>victim's home where they were going to<br>grab him<br>again as in the first case wilcox the<br>question was whether they were in the<br>throes of an attempted kidnapping<br>well<br>justice hammond reluctantly concluded<br>that the conduct was merely preparatory<br>and he reluctantly applied wilcox but he<br>noted<br>were it open to this court to start<br>afresh<br>he would have preferred to view<br>proximity as a relative matter<br>it might vary in its importance<br>having regard to the strength of such<br>other evidence as there is<br>as to the purposes and by that he meant<br>the intentions of the accused but he<br>said regretfully<br>that did not represent the present law<br>in new zealand and that was in 2003<br>however<br>the court of appeal in the next case of<br>harper in 2010<br>grasped that opportunity to start afresh<br>that was alluded to and buried and as a<br>side point the judge and barrett justice<br>hammond had been promoted to the court<br>of appeal by the time of harper and was<br>indeed one of the five presiding judges<br>in that case<br>harper<br>heralded a new way of approaching the<br>question of proximity<br>harper<br>and you'll be pleased i don't have<br>photographs for this case<br>harper was charged with the attempted<br>sexual violation of two children<br>he was in a text messaging relationship<br>with an adult woman<br>and sent her a video and text messages<br>indicated<br>that he was<br>involved in abusing children under<br>police guidance<br>the woman arranged to meet harper<br>telling him that she would bring her<br>ten-year-old sister and four-year-old<br>niece with her<br>unbeknown to harper neither child<br>existed in fact and i'll come back to<br>that in a moment<br>harper was waiting when a car driven by<br>a female police officer arrived at the<br>arranged meeting place<br>now you might be wondering about the<br>non-existent children<br>well they are irrelevant for the<br>purposes of the crime of attempt<br>section 72 the attempt provision in the<br>crimes act<br>says that as long as the person has the<br>intention<br>and has done proximate acts<br>it does not matter if it was impossible<br>for any reason to commit the offence so<br>impossibility is generally no defense to<br>a charge of attempt yet another riddle<br>in the<br>law of attempt but one that we don't<br>have time to look at tonight so you'll<br>just have to trust me on that one<br>counter-intuitive though it may be<br>again<br>the question in harper was whether the<br>acts were proximate and this time the<br>court of appeal said yes<br>and it held that harper had performed a<br>number of acts which when taken together<br>constituted an attempt to commit to to<br>commit sexual violation<br>he had moved beyond mere preparation and<br>at the time of his arrest he was lying<br>and wait for the victim<br>in the court's opinion section 72<br>permitted the defendant's conduct to be<br>considered in its entirety<br>with the fact that<br>strong evidence of intent<br>as there was in that case can assist in<br>assessing the significance of the acts<br>done towards the commission of the<br>intended offence<br>and of course harper's explicit text<br>messages revealing his intentions<br>towards the putative victims<br>was an essential factor in deciding the<br>proximity of his actions<br>now the court said that rather than<br>trying to invent a new test of proximity<br>the direct purpose of its ruling was<br>simply to reassess wilcox which it held<br>had been wrongly decided on the facts<br>however<br>the legacy of harper is i think rather<br>more pervasive than that<br>it has rather created a new precedent<br>for looking at matters in the round<br>where strong evidence of intention can<br>now assist in assessing the significance<br>of the actions done toward the<br>commission of the offence<br>and this is the first time that we see<br>the actors mental state their intentions<br>are virtually used to measure the<br>quality or the significance of the acts<br>done and that is quite a shift from the<br>old wilcox approach of compartmentalized<br>intentions on the one hand and actions<br>but harper left one matter unresolved<br>exactly what the court meant by strong<br>evidence of intent<br>needn't didn't need to be explored in<br>that case because on the facts there was<br>ample evidence of harper's intention in<br>those text messages<br>but not all cases are going to be that<br>clear<br>and the final case in this quartet<br>takes harper one step further<br>and it demonstrates that the courts seem<br>to be prepared to give a broad reading<br>of what amounts to<br>strong evidence of intent<br>in johnson the father of the 16 year old<br>complainant<br>found the defendant lurking in the<br>backyard of the family home<br>a few metres from a detached sleep out<br>where the girl slept at night<br>it was early evening<br>johnson was wearing dark clothing<br>he was carrying a torch<br>and there was evidence that he'd been<br>watching the house for some weeks prior<br>to the incident<br>on the basis of that johnson was charged<br>with attempted rape<br>now the case made its way to the supreme<br>court last year<br>which agreed with the court of appeal<br>that johnson's conduct did amount to<br>attempted rape<br>but unlike harper<br>this time there was no direct evidence<br>of johnson's intentions<br>because johnson argued throughout that<br>he was there to commit a property<br>burglary not rape<br>however<br>the courts had allowed the crown to<br>introduce something called propensity<br>evidence to establish or help establish<br>that johnson was on that property with<br>the intention of committing rape not<br>burglary<br>now propensity evidence is evidence that<br>tends to show<br>a person's predisposition to behave in a<br>particular way<br>and the evidence that was admitted in<br>that case<br>included two rape convictions in the<br>1990s<br>and the evidence of a fellow prison<br>inmate<br>and a halfway house flatmate regarding<br>conversations that they had had with<br>johnson<br>the supreme court unanimously confirmed<br>the approach taken in harper that<br>evidence of intention<br>is relevant to determining whether the<br>defendant's actions approximate<br>and the court says<br>this does not turn mere preparation into<br>an attempt<br>rather it is recognising that we clear<br>intent to show in the decision maker has<br>a basis to determine whether the conduct<br>is more than mere preparation<br>and the court considered that johnson's<br>presence on the property<br>and his movement toward the sleepout<br>could not be assessed in terms of<br>whether it was preparatory or proximate<br>without considering the evidence of his<br>intent to sexually violate<br>a teenage girl<br>evidence remember this time obtained via<br>propensity evidence<br>so<br>in conclusion to this first part of the<br>talk<br>what seems to be emerging<br>is a rather more loosely textured test<br>of proximity than the more<br>compartmentalized or segregated test<br>used back in the days of wilcox<br>and i would suggest that this new if you<br>like global approach<br>does provide the opportunity to push the<br>dividing line back further in certain<br>cases<br>evidence of intention remember including<br>propensity evidence<br>can now be used to reinforce the conduct<br>component in those cases where a close<br>line call is required<br>what then should we make of these<br>changes<br>well<br>not just the law of attempt but the<br>criminal law in general terms<br>including multiple aspects of policing<br>criminal procedure and sentencing policy<br>has changed markedly since i first began<br>researching in the area<br>and some of the more visible and more<br>consciously targeted changes over that<br>time have been the concerted political<br>efforts<br>to get tough on crime<br>and this of course has resulted in a<br>number of things such as enhancing<br>police powers to respond to crime<br>and threats of crime<br>tightening bail<br>reducing parole<br>increasing sentences<br>and giving victims of crime more of a<br>voice with the enactment of the victims<br>rights act in 2002<br>and the list goes on<br>and these are very positive moves<br>because for a long time the criminal<br>justice system has been criticized as<br>being out of touch with community<br>attitudes towards crime and punishment<br>and the victims of crime<br>and judges especially sentencing judges<br>have been the focus of particular<br>criticism<br>as an unelected cultural elite that is<br>out of step with the wishes<br>and expectations of the community<br>and so the interpretation of section 72<br>in the two recent attempt cases of<br>harper and johnson<br>is symptomatic of this generally more<br>policy motivated<br>and sometimes less defendant friendly<br>stance that we have generally seen<br>emerging in recent years<br>and this is a natural response to<br>perceived threats to our safety which<br>always seem to be on the increase as<br>again we've recently seen in the news<br>and never on the decrease<br>and of course the defendants in such<br>cases are quite unsympathetic characters<br>whom we rightly regard as deserving of<br>censure<br>and so for example the defendant in<br>johnson<br>had a very disturbing criminal record<br>stretching that many years<br>and charging him with attempted sexual<br>violation had the practical advantage<br>that if convicted he could be sentenced<br>to preventive detention<br>so then there is a very persuasive<br>argument that practical<br>or policy considerations<br>directed at the public good<br>rightfully outweigh matters of strict<br>doctrinal principle in such attempt<br>cases<br>but should they<br>should we simply accept this trend or<br>should we at least subject it to some<br>scrutiny<br>don't forget that by buying into the<br>tough on crime brand name<br>just as we may reap advantages<br>we also run the risk of diluting our own<br>rights<br>and the recent developments in attempt<br>demonstrate the very important<br>gatekeeper role<br>played by the courts<br>but whether the right balance has now<br>been achieved is i would suggest at<br>least open to debate<br>in order to assess whether the right<br>balance has been achieved<br>i think we need to go back to first<br>principles and ask why it is that we<br>treat an attempt to commit a crime as a<br>crime in its own right<br>well the most obvious answer to that is<br>that it helps prevent harm or at least<br>more serious harm from happening<br>so conduct leading to the commission of<br>the full crime is therefore a legitimate<br>target because that conduct risks<br>completion of the full offence<br>and the police require the legal mandate<br>to step in<br>and prevent an actor who is on the way<br>to committing a crime from going any<br>further<br>so as the old proverb says an ounce of<br>prevention is indeed worth a pound of<br>cure<br>two theories<br>about the law of attempt<br>which help explain why the courts<br>sometimes lean in favor of the<br>prosecution<br>and sometimes lean in favor of the<br>defendant<br>and the first of these is the subjective<br>theory which places emphasis on the<br>intention element of the offending<br>so criminal liability is primarily<br>assessed on what the individual intended<br>to do<br>rather than the actual consequences of<br>their conduct<br>and so this nip it in the bud approach<br>is designed to ensure public public<br>safety as far as possible<br>and it therefore justifies imposing<br>liability at an earlier and more remote<br>stage from the full offense<br>contrast that with the second theory the<br>objective theory<br>which focuses rather on the defendant's<br>conduct<br>and imposes liability generally at a<br>later stage<br>once the defendant is physically close<br>to committing the crime<br>now objectivists tend to require a<br>manifest threat to the security<br>interests of others<br>and they place importance on the<br>preservation of individual freedom<br>unconstrained by police and judicial<br>interference and wilcox is an example of<br>that more<br>defendant-friendly objective approach<br>and in that case the court placed a lot<br>of emphasis on the physical steps that<br>the defendants had not yet performed<br>when they were stopped one mile from the<br>post office<br>the difficulty is that both sides of the<br>argument are of course susceptible to<br>extremes<br>an overly rigid objective approach leads<br>to only the last step or steps counting<br>as an attempt<br>and delayed intervention<br>of course risks unjustified harm to<br>individuals or property<br>and leaves the police and<br>the judiciary<br>vulnerable to criticism from the general<br>community<br>but equally if the subjective approach<br>is pushed too far<br>there is a valid concern that overly<br>zealous intervention<br>can risk punishing people who have done<br>little more than form criminal intention<br>now in new zealand the pendulum has<br>recently swung in favor of subjectivism<br>with harper and johnson placing emphasis<br>on the defendant's<br>intentions looking to the future<br>we therefore need to be wary of that<br>approach being pushed too far<br>for example a potential concern<br>might be that actors who have<br>voluntarily<br>abandoned their plans of their own<br>accord<br>could be deprived of making that claim<br>if the subjective preference for the<br>emphasis on the actor's intention is<br>pushed too far<br>and there is always a worry that in<br>persuasive enough hands<br>almost any conduct could be made to<br>appear guilty<br>in the presence of strong enough<br>evidence<br>of the defendant's intentions<br>now that is not to detract from the fact<br>that both harper and johnson<br>involved allegations of disturbing<br>intentions on the part of the actors and<br>so it's hardly surprising that the<br>courts gave added weight to the need to<br>step in quickly to prevent harm to the<br>putative victims in those cases<br>and of course it's not difficult to<br>identify other contexts<br>such as cases of suspected terrorist<br>activity for example where there are<br>equally strong arguments<br>for nipping nascent criminal activity in<br>the bud as soon as possible<br>so then on an individual basis<br>the ends might appear to justify the<br>means<br>particularly when sensitive or security<br>issues are at stake<br>and public opinion runs high<br>but whatever we might think about the<br>ultimate justice of outcomes in cases<br>like johnson<br>the reasoning does take the wording of<br>section 72 in a new direction<br>the express words of section 72<br>immediately approximately connected to<br>the intended offence which were once<br>that critical marker of an attempt<br>are just not as center stage as they<br>once were<br>so to the final part of the talk<br>the question then becomes<br>is there a solution well that's the case<br>isn't it<br>i preface the following comments with<br>the caveat that the law of attempt is<br>one pocket or corner of the criminal law<br>that is likely to be written off as i<br>would describe it as an unrequited<br>goldilocks<br>whatever<br>test or gloss is define is devised it's<br>always going to be too hard too soft and<br>never just right you are never going to<br>please all of the people all of the time<br>or indeed most of the people any of the<br>time<br>so<br>we're really in a catch-22 in this part<br>of the law<br>now of course advocates of this new<br>global approach<br>of looking to the person's intention to<br>tell you whether their actions<br>approximate enough<br>they would argue that no solution is<br>required because there is no problem<br>on the contrary they would argue that<br>the courts have at last located an<br>appropriate interpretation of the<br>statute<br>others however<br>might suggest that we should at least be<br>looking for a more doctrinally<br>satisfying solution<br>that avoids if i might borrow the words<br>of dennis denuto<br>in the film the castle<br>an answer based largely on the vibe of<br>conservatively it is possible<br>that a wait-and-see approach is all that<br>is needed<br>and that future cases will tease out a<br>more nuanced approach<br>or perhaps confine harper and johnson to<br>like offences of sexual offending<br>or maybe that future cases would even<br>reconsider the use of propensity<br>evidence as a means of getting traction<br>on intention<br>another option might be for parliament<br>to take another tilt at the attempt<br>section in the crimes act although i<br>have no great faith but that would<br>amount to much more than tilting at<br>windmills<br>amendments to equivalent attempt laws in<br>comparable overseas jurisdictions have<br>simply not achieved the desired clarity<br>or<br>maybe we're simply looking at this<br>problem from the wrong angle<br>if we accept that there are cogent<br>policy reasons<br>to allow the police to step in<br>at an early stage where proximity in the<br>traditional sense of that word is still<br>doubtful<br>then the issue is surely whether attempt<br>continues to be the right offence<br>and the appropriate label<br>for the sorts of conduct that we deem<br>worthy of punishment<br>if so<br>then classifying the defendant's actions<br>as an attempt<br>is actually to mislabel<br>might it not then be more appropriate<br>simply to acknowledge<br>that the law is justified in<br>criminalizing certain preparatory<br>activity<br>and simply re-label it accordingly<br>the actor's conduct would still be<br>recognised as a threat requiring<br>preventive intervention but not to the<br>same degree<br>that it would have been had the conduct<br>reached the stage of immediate or<br>proximate connection with the intended<br>offence<br>a penalty reduction<br>would recognise that the actor had taken<br>fewer steps towards the commission of<br>the full offence<br>and that preparatory conduct is indeed<br>not the equivalent to<br>a full-blown attempt<br>an offence of preparation would satisfy<br>subjectivist concerns<br>by recognizing the social utility<br>of stopping the actor at an early stage<br>in order to prevent harm being done<br>but it would also satisfy the<br>requirement of giving individuals due<br>notice of what not to do in order to<br>avoid criminal sanction<br>for a particular offence<br>and all of that would mean that the<br>attempt label would not need to be over<br>extended<br>and could be reserved for activity of a<br>genuinely immediate or proximate nature<br>and i should perhaps mention that the<br>idea of offences of preparation<br>is not entirely without president<br>for example new zealand criminal law<br>currently recognises a number of<br>preparatory offences<br>in specific areas<br>so for example the misuse of drugs<br>legislation prohibits the supply<br>production or manufacture of precursor<br>substances<br>the arms act prohibits the carrying of a<br>firearm with criminal intent<br>and there are various offences of a<br>preparatory nature<br>in the terrorism suppression act<br>however<br>i fully accept that it would be naive to<br>suppose that a general offense of<br>preparation would be free from problems<br>and the most patent objection<br>would be that the current concerns<br>about locating the borderline between<br>preparation and proximity<br>would simply be replaced by the problem<br>but one step back<br>and there is a risk that a general<br>offence of preparation could be<br>interpreted as an invitation to extend<br>liability<br>further and still further back<br>and critics of that approach would argue<br>that this solution would risk<br>normalizing<br>criminalization at an even earlier point<br>in time<br>so<br>another impasse maybe and yet again we<br>go around in circles and so i suspect<br>that this attempt puzzle is not done<br>with me just yet<br>so in conclusion all of this puts me in<br>mind of a passage from lewis carroll's<br>through the looking glass which i will<br>leave you with this evening<br>and it's where alice is talking with the<br>queen<br>and asks her what sorts of things she<br>remembers best to which the queen<br>replies<br>things that happened the week after next<br>the queen then told alice about the<br>king's messenger who was in prison being<br>punished and the trial doesn't even<br>begin till next wednesday and of course<br>the crime comes last of all<br>suppose he never commits the crime alice<br>asked<br>that would be all the better wouldn't it<br>replied the queen<br>alice felt there was no denying that but<br>replied but it wouldn't be all the<br>better his being punished you're wrong<br>there at any rate said the queen were<br>you ever punished<br>only for fault said alice and you were<br>all the beta for it i know the queen<br>said triumphantly<br>yes but then i had done the things i was<br>punished for said alice and that makes<br>all the difference<br>but if you hadn't done them the queen<br>said that would have been better still<br>better and better and better and her<br>voice went higher with each better until<br>it got quite to a squeak at last<br>and alice was just begun beginning to<br>say there's a mistake somewhere<br>when the queen began screaming so loud<br>that alice had to leave her sentence<br>unfinished<br>and for fans of lewis carroll you will<br>recall why the queen was screaming so<br>loudly<br>it was because her finger was bleeding<br>even though she had yet to prick it<br>so i think that is more than enough<br>rabbit holes for one evening thank you<br>my name is tony ballentine and i'm the<br>pro vice chancellor humanities and it's<br>with great pleasure that i'll deliver a<br>vote of thanks to professor briggs<br>margaret has delivered an excellent<br>lecture reflecting on the development of<br>her research and teaching<br>it all began as margaret told us with a<br>conversion here by the waters of the<br>leaf<br>where the enthusiasm and knowledge of<br>mark hennigan and kevin dawkins had<br>transformative power<br>and those reflections i think margaret<br>reminds us<br>just how important our work as teachers<br>is and how transformative great teaching<br>can be and then again in the lecture<br>itself she's role modeled the lecture<br>form<br>of course the primary focus of her talk<br>this evening has been uh the law of<br>attempt she recounted that this was the<br>subject of her first block of teaching<br>here as an assistant lecturer so we've<br>come in a full intellectual circle<br>but she also observed that this has been<br>an abiding and consistent interest<br>throughout her career<br>and i think again this reminds us of the<br>important feedback loop that exists<br>between<br>teaching and research and that is<br>something that our university really<br>values very highly<br>as we've heard uh her lecture used four<br>cases to trace changes that have taken<br>place in the law of attempt from 1982<br>through to the 20 teens particularly the<br>increased weight attached to the actor's<br>mental state as<br>evidence of intent a shift as margaret<br>has suggested was a key element in a<br>move to a more global or holistic<br>approach to interpreting these questions<br>this evening margaret carefully explored<br>the ensuing question<br>did these shifts get the balance right<br>and assessing the borderline between<br>preparation and attempt<br>while she acknowledged that the law of<br>attempt is difficult to test<br>for some any such assessments will<br>either be too hard while for many others<br>it will be too soft but she then<br>provided an alternative way forward<br>asking whether attempt continues to be<br>the right offence and whether in fact it<br>is an appropriate label for the sorts of<br>actions that the wider community wants<br>to prevent was a punish<br>and she suggested that exploring the<br>possibility of offences of preparation<br>might be a constructive way forward<br>with the caveat that this is a very<br>difficult legal puzzle to solve<br>i think margaret's lecture has been<br>incredibly thoughtful and engaging<br>most of all it has demonstrated the<br>great social importance i think<br>of legal thought and practice and<br>establishing the rules that we live by<br>and how we interpret and enact those<br>rules as a society<br>so i'd like to invite you all to join<br>the academic party for refreshments in a<br>moment across the hall<br>but right now i'd like to invite you<br>to thank and recognize<br>margaret for a fantastic level lecture<br>and to celebrate her promotion while i<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
