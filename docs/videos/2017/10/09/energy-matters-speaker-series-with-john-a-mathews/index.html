enhance its energy security and clean up its deteriorating urban environment.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so thank you thank you very much Steven<br>for the introduction and it's a great<br>pleasure an enormous pleasure to be here<br>speaking in Auckland tonight and thank<br>you for to the Energy Education Trust of<br>New Zealand for sponsoring the event so<br>you've heard a book global green shift<br>and from Sir with series meets Gaia and<br>you would be forgiven for thinking that<br>this talk the global green shift is<br>going to be all about carbon emissions<br>and global warming the ocean<br>acidification death of coral reefs<br>around the world loss of biodiversity<br>species loss all of these terrible<br>things that we know are going on but in<br>fact I'm not going to talk about any of<br>those things I'm going to be talking<br>about industrial dynamics and the<br>specific feature of industrial dynamics<br>that I want to discuss is the rise of<br>China and my argument is quite simply<br>the China is industrializing at a scale<br>which is unprecedented in history and as<br>China industrialize --is if it were to<br>follow a conventional fossil fuel<br>pathway that every other industrialized<br>country followed prior to China if it<br>were to do so then it would run up<br>against impossible limits limits to do<br>with the supply of oil and coal and gas<br>the fossil fuels themselves but more<br>broadly limits to do with the supply of<br>resources it would run into geopolitical<br>limits not just resources and limits to<br>growth in that sense but geopolitical<br>limits and my argument is then that it's<br>all about scale and the scale of China<br>really forces it to adopt a green<br>strategy and having done so it's then<br>setting<br>that become available around the world<br>now I'm not going to just ask you to<br>take my word for this I'm going to<br>present the evidence that will convince<br>you I believe the China is indeed<br>following this pathway and the point is<br>I'm a social scientist and the proper<br>procedure for social scientists is to<br>look at the evidence and then to<br>formulate theories or explanations that<br>will help to account for that evidence<br>and I want to discuss the evidence with<br>you for what China is doing and then<br>discuss a plausible account a plausible<br>explanation for why China is doing what<br>it's doing okay that's my agenda for the<br>evening and there's no better place to<br>start such a discussion than with a<br>chart on the shift of manufacturing<br>value-added around the world so this<br>line this chart shows you the wealthy<br>industrialized countries the members of<br>the OECD in the blue line coming down<br>and the red line coming up is<br>manufacturing value added by non-oecd<br>members for which read China China is by<br>far the most significant of the non-oecd<br>members and you can see that those lines<br>are about to cross in fact they probably<br>already have crossed this is a chart<br>prepared by the OECD and it shows you<br>that manufacturing is moving east it's<br>moving to China and in terms of<br>manufacturing we are already living in a<br>sono centric world now that's a very<br>significant feature of global industrial<br>dynamics and it's the starting point for<br>my argument and it's the starting point<br>because I'm arguing that what China is<br>doing is building a system that will<br>allow enable it to become the workshop<br>of the world as indeed it is that is its<br>strategy and here we see China's<br>Electric Power<br>generation and the proportion of China's<br>electric power coming from renewable<br>sources water wind and Sun and you can<br>see that over on the right hand side<br>that line is going up and up and up<br>that's the primary evidence that China<br>has already made a choice that it's<br>moving away from fossil fuels and it's<br>increasing its proportion of dependence<br>on renewable sources<br>this is capacity and you can see that<br>the capacity has already reached 35%<br>dependence on renewables now that also<br>means that China's that China's power<br>generation system is a very large system<br>and it's still largely dependent on coal<br>so there's no getting away from the fact<br>that it's a black coal-fired system but<br>you can see that what's happening<br>year-on-year its greening and that's the<br>significance of that chart when you look<br>at the comparison between China and the<br>rest of the world you see that China is<br>already a superpower in renewables<br>looking at the capacity that has been<br>built China far surpasses all the other<br>industrialized countries the United<br>States they're Germany India China is<br>the giant in terms of rebuilding<br>renewable energy systems they're hydro<br>systems wind power systems solar<br>photovoltaic systems so China is already<br>in a sense the Saudi Arabia of<br>renewables it's already the world's<br>superpower in renewables and in terms of<br>comparisons between China and other<br>leading parts of the world here's a<br>comparison between China and the<br>European Union so on the right hand side<br>we see the European Union building up<br>its investments in renewable systems<br>increasing each year through the early<br>2000s but then peaking and starting to<br>pull back whereas China is building up<br>and by now China is investing two and a<br>half times each year what the European<br>Union as a whole is investing so China<br>again in terms of its investments in<br>renewable systems already far exceeding<br>those of the European Union and it's a<br>trend that we can see continuing into<br>the future so then we have these twin<br>phases of China as it builds this<br>enormous energy system to drive its<br>enormous manufacturing system and I do<br>ask you to bear in mind the scale at<br>which we're talking this is by far the<br>largest manufacturing system ever<br>constructed on the face of the earth and<br>it has to be powered by an enormous<br>energy system and the energy system that<br>China has been using is this electric<br>power system based largely on coal<br>because every previous industrializing<br>region and country used coal as its<br>driver so that happened in Britain first<br>then it happened in Western Europe then<br>it happened in the United States and it<br>happened in Japan it happened in Korea<br>it happened in Taiwan all these<br>countries utilized coal as the driver of<br>the industrialization and building<br>manufacturing industries China has done<br>the same with a major inflection point<br>in the year 2001 anybody tell me what<br>happened in China in the year 2001 why<br>this inflection point it was the year<br>China joined the World Trade<br>Organization<br>once China was in the WTO then it was a<br>serious player in terms of the global<br>economy and you can see it ramped up its<br>production of Coal Fired electric power<br>very very rapidly that was a government<br>decision but you can also see the<br>influence of the government up there<br>where you see the coal burning leveling<br>off because as China has been burning<br>these enormous quantities of coal so<br>it's been creating enormous pollution<br>problems and it's reached the limit of<br>tolerance of that pollution and now the<br>government is intervening to scale back<br>that degree of<br>coal burning and the evidence is there<br>incontrovertible evidence meanwhile what<br>is complementing that black economy the<br>burning of so much coal to drive the<br>fossil fuel economy in China meanwhile<br>it's ramping up it's a complementary<br>green economy<br>here we see wind power and there you can<br>see it's doubling in capacity every<br>couple of years so that's going to<br>continue again in the future you can see<br>that there's a clear trend there China<br>seems to have made a big investment a<br>big commitment to wind power along with<br>the other major renewable sources solar<br>power and hydro power what I'm<br>presenting you here is evidence and I<br>then want to move to consider what is<br>the significance of this of these data<br>and how can we account for them how can<br>we offer a plausible explanation for why<br>this industrializing country is taking<br>choice is making choices and choosing a<br>direction of development so different<br>from all previous industrializing powers<br>this is really the most significant<br>question in the whole of the social<br>sciences not enough people are<br>addressing themselves to answering this<br>question in case you think that China<br>might be betting on nuclear power as<br>many climate scientists in the United<br>States argue they argue completely<br>without evidence that China is likely to<br>settle on nuclear power well here's the<br>evidence that it won't already by the<br>year 2008 2009 in terms of capacity wind<br>power exceeded nuclear capacity in China<br>and by the years 2012 2013 already the<br>electricity generated by wind exceeded<br>the electricity generated by nuclear so<br>nuclear will not be the answer for China<br>it's the renewables partly because<br>they're they have low marginal costs but<br>because<br>has an abundance of these renewables but<br>the real reason and I'll come to this in<br>the talk the real reason is that<br>renewables are the products of<br>manufacturing so if they're the products<br>of manufacturing they give you energy<br>security that's the core of my argument<br>now is what China is doing comparable to<br>what is going on in the rest of the<br>world well here's the evidence that it<br>is this shows you global investment in<br>power capacity and globally right<br>through the the most recent years you<br>can see that the build-up of that the<br>investment in capacity for renewables is<br>by far the most important of the energy<br>investments then it's followed by fossil<br>fuel then large hydro and nuclear a long<br>way behind so the significance of that<br>is that China is making choices that are<br>consistent with those that are being<br>made globally and of course as the<br>largest player China's choices are<br>influencing what is being done globally<br>and here's the most recent data which<br>reinforces this point that global new<br>electric capacity added is largely in<br>the realm of renewables if you can read<br>those across their soul that wind rather<br>than in the fossil fuels that are over<br>to the right of the of the chart and<br>consistently in year by year China's<br>investments in water wind and some are<br>out breaking the investments in fossil<br>fuels and nuclear now of course in other<br>countries and in other regions other<br>instruments like California States in<br>Kalinin in the United States like<br>California we see very ambitious goals<br>being set so here's California with<br>Governor Jerry Brown saying that by 2030<br>California would be generating 50% 50%<br>of its power would be coming from<br>renewable sources<br>now that's an ambition<br>target but the point is when Governor<br>Jerry Brown says that how does he then<br>translate that target into actual<br>investment flowing from the banks in<br>China the government sets the target and<br>then the banks invest to meet that<br>target in this case in California<br>Governor Jerry Brown can say this is an<br>ambitious target but he has no power<br>over the banks he has no power over the<br>choices being made by the big private<br>sector energy utilities so it's an<br>aspirational goal but it's not a clear<br>target that is intended to be reached in<br>the way that the targets are met in<br>China and in other in other<br>industrialized countries we see similar<br>kinds of developments here we see in<br>Germany which is amongst the<br>industrialized countries the closest to<br>China in terms of its commitments to<br>renewable power so we see German<br>electricity generation reaching 35%<br>coming from renewable sources in the<br>most recent data and you see that in in<br>Germany's case it's a substitution<br>between nuclear and renewables so here<br>our nuclear coming down and here our<br>renewables rising and that's the<br>proportion so it's still again even in<br>Germany is still a very large coal-fired<br>system about Germany is is moving<br>because they have a strong government<br>commitment to move in that direction<br>elections are fought on that commitment<br>and that's what results if we do a<br>comparable chart for China to look at<br>electricity generation again we see that<br>the trend is going up and China's<br>electricity being generated comes 25<br>percent from renewables similar to the<br>case with the capacity but again this<br>chart shows you this is total<br>electricity generated the<br>says the renewables coming from water<br>wind and Sun you can see it's still only<br>25 percent of the total it's still a<br>large coal-fired power system so I've<br>been talking to you about energy but I<br>could also spend a lot of time talking<br>about the wider resource question the<br>resources the iron ore the aluminium of<br>the bauxite that goes in the the the<br>iron ore that goes into steel these<br>resources also being utilized by China<br>at a colossal scale far larger than any<br>in previous industrializing country and<br>there's still a lot of room for China to<br>improve its resource efficiency so here<br>we see China's aspirations to as part of<br>the 12th five-year plan in 2015 to reach<br>that resource efficiency whereas the<br>OECD countries are already well in<br>advance of that so there's plenty of<br>scope for catch-up by China in terms of<br>resource efficiency but what China is<br>using to do that is a very novel model<br>of how the economy works it's called the<br>circular economy<br>here we see China's circular economy at<br>work where inputs sourced from outputs<br>of one manufacturing process feeding<br>into another process so the the waste<br>becomes the food of the next industrial<br>process so here's an example we see a<br>sugar refinery and it is generating<br>fiber which is burned to produce<br>electricity or some fiber goes into a<br>pulp mill which goes into a paper plant<br>other parts of the sugarcane go into<br>production of ethanol so this is the<br>circulation of resources and the more<br>that resources circulate the curette the<br>less the impact on the wider environment<br>the greater the resource efficiency so<br>we can see that just as much as China is<br>improving<br>it's energy efficiency by making<br>renewables the source for energy so we<br>can see that the circulation of<br>resources is China's solution to the<br>problem of improving resource efficiency<br>so that's a very very quick very fast<br>passage through some quite astonishing<br>data about the scale at which China is<br>is embarked on it's industrializing<br>industrialization project so let's<br>discuss the the reasoning on the part of<br>China let's discuss an explanation for<br>why it's pursuing that pathway now here<br>would be a chart for the conventional<br>pathway pursuing fossil fuels if China<br>were to pursue the conventional pathway<br>then its consumption of fossil fuels<br>would continue to grow and its<br>dependence on imports would continue to<br>grow the gap between these two would<br>indicate the the dependence on imports<br>of fossil fuels of coal of oil of gas<br>likewise with India which is following<br>in China's pathways it's you can see the<br>gap is even broader in relative terms<br>the absolute numbers are smaller but the<br>gap is wider in relative terms now what<br>would that mean for a country like China<br>to have that widening gap between its<br>fossil fuels production and consumption<br>it would mean increasing dependence on<br>hot spots around the world<br>so Nigeria for example is a hot spot in<br>Africa for oil production or South Sudan<br>China becomes a leading customer of oil<br>from South Sudan and what happens after<br>China becomes a leading customer anybody<br>know what happened in South Sudan civil<br>war a civil war breaks out now where did<br>that civil war come from actually nobody<br>knows nobody's saying maybe the CIA had<br>something to do with it we don't know<br>nobody's saying we don't know but the<br>point is China becomes a leading<br>importer of oil from South Sudan and<br>suddenly the country is plunged into<br>civil war that's what I call a<br>geopolitical limit it become too too<br>dependent on unstable countries and<br>suddenly all your plans for imports are<br>blown or blown apart and then you can<br>you carry on around the rest of the<br>world Ecuador Venezuela in Latin America<br>other countries in Central Asia and not<br>just oil but other fossil fuels and<br>resources so there are geopolitical<br>limits in the form of war in the form of<br>revolution in the form of terrorism they<br>are the geopolitical limits that China<br>would face if it were to pursue a fossil<br>fuel pathway here's another pathway that<br>was followed in the United States that<br>again would represent a nun promising an<br>unpromising trajectory for China these<br>this was General Motors great gift to<br>the United States they were buying up<br>trolley car companies these were the<br>trolley cars that ran in Los Angeles and<br>provided a very good public transport<br>system in Los Angeles now you arrive in<br>Los Angeles at LAX Airport and there's<br>no public transport why because General<br>Motors bought up the trolley cars and<br>then trashed them trashed the trolley<br>cars so that's not a pathway that China<br>would want to follow now what drives the<br>sense in China's choices is the falling<br>costs of renewables now these are not<br>falling costs in the same way that you<br>can read the price of oil today in the<br>price of oil tomorrow is dependent on<br>choices made by OPEC and Saudi Arabia<br>these are costs associated with<br>manufacturing these are predictable<br>costs they're associated with the<br>learning curve or the experience curve<br>so this shows you in the top-line<br>crystalline silicon photovoltaics<br>modules and the bottom line the costs of<br>energy storage in the form of<br>lithium-ion batteries coming down and<br>they're coming down and they're coming<br>down because as the scale of production<br>increases the efficiency of production<br>improves and the cost comes down now<br>that's what is backing China's choices<br>it's the fact that all of the renewable<br>energies solar photovoltaic the wind<br>power and the jet and the manufacturer<br>of wind turbines the manufacturer of<br>energy storage systems all of these are<br>products of manufacturing and as such<br>they benefit from the experience curve<br>of a learning curve which is associated<br>with manufacturing that is the<br>fundamental reason why in my account<br>China is making the choice in favor of<br>renewables that it is doing so when we<br>look at solar photovoltaic for example<br>it seems all very new it seems these are<br>completely new companies with the new<br>technology<br>but in fact it's an old story we know<br>this story it's the story of Henry Ford<br>and how he created an enormous market<br>for automobiles at the early years of<br>the 20th century and as he did so he was<br>able to drive down the costs of those<br>automobiles the Model T that's the<br>famous one and the more he dropped his<br>cut his surprise the more the market<br>expanded and the more the market<br>expanded the more he was able to capture<br>efficiencies and economies of scale and<br>he brought his costs down and that<br>enabled him to reduce his prices and so<br>you go round and round in a virtuous<br>cycle that is called circular and<br>cumulative causation that is a<br>fundamental economic principle and yet<br>I'm prepared to bet that anybody in the<br>room has done an economics course has<br>never heard of that principal circular<br>and Kim<br>causation it's just not taught as part<br>of economics and yet it's fundamental to<br>mass production industries which are the<br>modern industries of the modern era and<br>of course they are the industries that<br>China is building starting with<br>renewable energy industries so China's<br>model of development is all about<br>infrastructure and it can do that<br>because it has the scale the size of<br>China is huge and here we see it's<br>colossal infrastructure in a transport<br>system high-speed rail system so this is<br>for China in the 21st century what the<br>interstate highway system was for the<br>United States in the 20th century so<br>China is has built an enormous transport<br>infrastructure in the full of high-speed<br>rail and now it's utilizing that to<br>drive its trajectory in energy and<br>resources the other huge infrastructure<br>project linked with what I'm discussing<br>the green shift is the grid and here we<br>see China's investments in its own<br>national domestic grid and beyond China<br>into grids associated with it that can<br>be integrated with it that could be<br>called the age of super grid and there<br>we see China again being a world leader<br>in promoting the idea of a global<br>integrated smart grid and that's being<br>promoted by Liu Shinya the former head<br>of state grid Corporation of China what<br>does that mean a global integrated grid<br>would mean free trade in renewable power<br>free trade in renewable power so you<br>take it as a given that we have free<br>trade in oil free trade in coal free<br>trading gas but you stop short there and<br>you don't you don't think of free trade<br>in renewable power but this would be how<br>that could be created it's a Chinese<br>aspiration<br>and of course as China drives down the<br>costs which it's doing for its own<br>benefit as it does so it creates<br>opportunities for other countries and<br>this this is how I will treat the issue<br>of what should New Zealand be doing in<br>this situation opportunities are created<br>for other countries because the costs<br>are coming down as fast as they're<br>coming down and here we see countries in<br>Africa like Egypt there are some nice<br>picture of the world's oldest technology<br>the pyramids and the world's newest<br>technology solar photovoltaics and Egypt<br>can invest in solar photovoltaics<br>because their cost has come down so<br>rapidly because of China's investments<br>so that's the global impact of China's<br>choices and that's what I mean by China<br>driving this global green shift because<br>it's the falling costs generated by<br>driven by China that then create<br>opportunities around the rest of the<br>world so new business deals are possible<br>only because China has driven down the<br>costs in the first place and that<br>creates many opportunities with related<br>technology so it's not just solar<br>photovoltaics he is concentrated solar<br>power using mirrors and lenses to<br>concentrate the Sun the sun's energy on<br>a power tower in the middle of the of<br>the array and here we see new developing<br>countries like Morocco leading the way<br>in this transition so Morocco is one of<br>those North African countries that<br>didn't get oil so it missed out on the<br>whole oil revolution but it has plenty<br>of Sun and now as a smart country its<br>using the Sun to generate electric power<br>that will help to drive its own<br>development its own Industrial<br>Development and it can export it to<br>Europe through integrate connections<br>undersea cables across the Mediterranean<br>for the export of Moroccan concentrated<br>solar power and of course that relieves<br>energy anxieties in Europe they don't<br>have to rely so much on gas from Russia<br>they can get solar power from North<br>Africa now in the book I cover a range<br>of developments and I'll just mention in<br>passing the developments that are<br>occurring in agriculture because this<br>shift is global green shift it's<br>impinging on energy its impinging on<br>water it's making the desalination of<br>water as a feasible option for the<br>recirculation of water where water is<br>scarce into a possibility using<br>concentrated solar power and here we see<br>the growing of tomatoes in huge<br>greenhouses where you have sunshine that<br>is turned into energy by concentrated<br>solar power the energy is then used to<br>desalinate seawater which produces fresh<br>water to water the plants the power<br>drives the water through the greenhouse<br>and what you get is here we see lovely<br>green fresh tomatoes now this is<br>actually taking place in Australia it's<br>a place called Sun Drop farms it's in<br>Port Augusta on the Spencer Gulf in<br>South Australia and it's a long way from<br>anywhere hundreds of kilometres away so<br>it's highly it's extremely remote<br>there's absolutely no farming going on<br>in that area it's in desert country but<br>it's near the water near the seawater so<br>this is the future face of farming it's<br>not going to be huge fields watered by<br>rain it's going to be glass houses with<br>renewable power to desalinate sea water<br>and water that the plants that are grown<br>hydroponically there's really no limit<br>to how that system can be expanded<br>around the world this is a company<br>founded by a German entrepreneur called<br>Sun Drop Farms and it clearly has an<br>enormous future in a country like China<br>and moving into other sectors the green<br>shift is so having a big impact of<br>course in transport and I'll just show<br>you one slide this is the prediction<br>from blue Murray from Bloomberg New<br>Energy Finance on conventional<br>combustion vehicles are coming down<br>that's the red line while electric<br>vehicles and fuel cell vehicles come up<br>and they're seeing the crossover by just<br>around 2030 that's not very far away now<br>we're all waiting for the big<br>announcement from China<br>they've already indicated that they are<br>going to make an announcement about<br>banning the sale of fossil fuel vehicles<br>in China they haven't said when they<br>haven't said what the date will be but<br>everybody's waiting for that moment and<br>my guess is that it could be around 2030<br>in which case this crossover will occur<br>earlier then this chart would indicate<br>so my point here is that this green<br>shift is happening in energy and power<br>production it's happening in transport<br>it's happening in industry where we'll<br>be moving away from cement production<br>from steel production that are very very<br>carbon intensive operations and<br>eventually in agriculture and<br>horticulture as well this is a truly<br>global green shift that is involving all<br>countries and involving all industrial<br>sectors what I haven't mentioned so far<br>and what I want to close on is the issue<br>of finance and many people seem to think<br>that finance is the great restriction<br>shortage of capital for this green shift<br>that I've been describing but actually<br>there's no shortage of capital this is<br>the OECD's data on funds management that<br>is pension funds superannuation funds<br>insurance companies hedge funds<br>sovereign wealth funds these are all the<br>serious<br>sources of funding and according to the<br>OECD they exceed 70 trillion dollars now<br>all of those funds under management are<br>looking for a safe investment<br>traditionally they've been investing in<br>conventional projects from conventional<br>industrial projects fossil fuels oil<br>wells coal mines and all the rest of it<br>but now those projects are starting to<br>look a little bit less safe maybe<br>they're stranded assets and renewables<br>might look a lot safer particularly when<br>you look at the choices being made by<br>China and other countries but you need<br>to capture those funds you need a<br>suitable vehicle and here's the vehicle<br>it's green bonds so green bonds would be<br>floated by a bank on the world capital<br>markets and investors would buy the<br>green bond and the bank issuing the bond<br>would then use those funds to invest in<br>renewable and green projects so this was<br>the world's first green bond issued by a<br>non Development Bank non state-owned<br>bank this is the Korean export-import<br>bank and it was a five hundred million<br>dollar bond issued in March 2013 and it<br>was oversubscribed it was independently<br>audited as being sufficiently<br>sustainable and the point is it was so<br>successful that it was imitated by the<br>Bank of America that was managing the<br>release of the of the funds and the<br>Korean export-import bank itself went<br>back to the markets after a couple of<br>years and did a second a second trollish<br>so notice that this is a capitalist in<br>solution to a capitalist problem the<br>problem is to how to green the whole<br>system and here is a method through the<br>institution of the bond markets the bond<br>markets are the core<br>of world capital capitalist system and<br>here we can see how the bond markets<br>themselves can green by banks issuing<br>instruments that are targeted at<br>providing investments in renewable and<br>green projects again we see China<br>leading the way in this transformation<br>so we saw that there was a green finance<br>task force set up in China it's reported<br>and after that we see one bank after<br>another like the Agricultural Bank of<br>China the Shanghai Pudong Development<br>Bank and the Bank of China itself<br>issuing these green bonds both to<br>Chinese investors and internationally<br>around the world 36 billion dollars in<br>issuance up to the end of 2016 by China<br>a very very strong proportion of the<br>world total so this is a trend that we<br>can expect to see accelerating I note<br>that there's already an investment<br>already a development in New Zealand for<br>these green bonds in almost every<br>country that has a financial system will<br>be moving in this direction in the near<br>future so let me just say a couple of<br>words because we're here in the southern<br>hemisphere and so let me just say a<br>couple of words about what's going on<br>outside these core industrialized<br>countries that I've been discussing this<br>is the situation in Australia and the<br>best that one can say is that there is a<br>shift in electric power production<br>electric power generation and this is a<br>shift towards greater reliance on water<br>wind and Sun in Australia in spite of in<br>spite of government efforts to curb that<br>to slow that down so it's not a case of<br>the government leading from the front as<br>in China or in Germany it's a case of<br>the government trying to hold things<br>back but actually you can see<br>the investors have have won and the<br>whole system is indeed greenie in New<br>Zealand it's not quite as as manifested<br>and yet group New Zealand of course has<br>a very very green electric power system<br>already largely because of the legacy<br>investments in hydro and geothermal<br>energy so there's not so much scope in<br>New Zealand to green and is greening but<br>it's it's modest it's not what you would<br>say a definite green shift that's going<br>on but it is going in the right<br>direction not the wrong direction so<br>what can you say about the situation in<br>New Zealand you could say that it does<br>have a green electric power system<br>already but it's not as a result of<br>decisions taken over the so the last<br>decade by the New Zealand government<br>it's more this legacy of hydro and<br>geothermal power so there is still some<br>thermal content in the New Zealand power<br>generation system a little bit of coal a<br>little bit of gas<br>hardly any oil now but actually there<br>should be none<br>there should be no fossil fuels at all<br>in the New Zealand system there's not<br>needed because of the great reliance on<br>on hydro and geothermal and it should be<br>in my view a target for whatever<br>government is elected this coming<br>national election to get the fossil<br>fuels out of the electric generation<br>system in New Zealand there's support<br>cross-party support for a zero emissions<br>target and there are some electric power<br>retail companies like electricity<br>Meridian origin and contact that have<br>clear green targets but really there's<br>there's just no need for any fossil<br>fuels to be part of the New Zealand<br>electric power generation system and<br>some<br>of these companies like contact now have<br>their green borrowing program so they<br>are starting to get into this global<br>green shift in the financial sense so<br>what would New Zealand have to fear from<br>the global green shift my answer is<br>nothing it just creates opportunities<br>and that's why it would be it is it<br>makes sense for me to be giving this<br>talk not in the department of<br>engineering or the department of biology<br>biological sciences but in a business<br>school because in the end the green<br>shift is all about creating business<br>opportunities and my point is that going<br>on around the world is this huge green<br>shift that creates huge opportunities in<br>power generation in transport in<br>industry in agriculture these are all<br>areas where New Zealand can become<br>involved it has nothing to fear from the<br>global green shift so to round it off<br>this was the article that I published in<br>Nature on manufacturing herbals to build<br>energy security that's still very much a<br>minority view you'll cement you'll see<br>endless discussions about renewables in<br>the press and is always to do with<br>carbon emissions but notice that I<br>haven't mentioned carbon emissions once<br>in this talk because renewables are not<br>actually about carbon emissions that's<br>actually a fortunate side effect of the<br>use of renewables but renewables are<br>really about the fact that they're<br>manufactured and because they're<br>manufactured they benefit from a<br>learning curve and cost reduction and<br>that cost reduction makes them in the<br>end the winners of the great industrial<br>dynamics battles that are coming along<br>this was the second article in nature<br>that I did with my collaborator dr.<br>Houghton on lessons from China in the<br>circular economy so here we're looking<br>down on the Suzhou new industrial<br>district and a lot of the world's<br>electronics and electrical goods<br>produced in that sucia industrial park<br>and it has enormous requirements for<br>copper and gold for those electronic<br>products but most of those are met<br>through circulation it's a circular<br>economy the copper circulates within the<br>Suzhou district the gold circulates<br>within the Suzhou district that's what<br>we were discussing in that article and<br>then you have the book the greening of<br>capitalism with Asia driving the next<br>great transformation and the most recent<br>book global green shift what do I mean<br>by Ceres meeting Gaia what I'm talking<br>about here is when people discuss these<br>issues as I started the talk they talk<br>about carbon emissions and global<br>warming and ocean acidification and loss<br>of biodiversity and they then say well<br>we have to change the way the planet<br>works in order to solve these problems<br>and they usually end up in it with a<br>very gloomy prognostication oh it's too<br>late oh oh they're the the loss of<br>species is too great the biodiversity is<br>already too advanced but my argument is<br>that that's focusing on the wrong thing<br>we can't really control Gaia which is<br>the beautiful name for the living Earth<br>we can't control it but what we can<br>control is a system of renewable energy<br>and it's circular economy and that's<br>what you can call Sri circular economy<br>and renewable energy system now why do I<br>choose series as the acronym because<br>Ceres is the Latin goddess of fertility<br>so here we see a battle at the level of<br>the gods<br>so this global green shift is a battle<br>on Mount Olympus it's a battle between<br>the gods and we have to back series<br>because she's the goddess of fertility<br>she's the one who nurtures that's the<br>kind of technological system<br>we should be focusing on meanwhile we'll<br>let Gaea get on with managing herself<br>that's what she's very good at doing so<br>we have to create as much wilderness as<br>possible and that's my only policy<br>recommendation leave as much nature as<br>possible and focus all the activity of<br>our industrial civilization on circular<br>economy and renewable energy and that<br>can be done in five or ten percent of<br>the planet the rest can be left as<br>wilderness and that would be a best gift<br>to the coming generations a sizeable<br>proportion of the planet to be dedicated<br>to Gaia that's what that subtitle means<br>thank you very much for your attention</p></main><footer
