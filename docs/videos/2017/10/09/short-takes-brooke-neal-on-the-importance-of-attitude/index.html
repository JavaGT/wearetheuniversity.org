overcoming barriers to success on and off the field.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my biggest injury would be to my right<br>knee which happened about four years ago<br>I started getting pain in it and I<br>pushed through when I probably should<br>have stopped and it led to four years of<br>chronic pain so every morning every<br>night waking up and pain and it really<br>did a lot to my mind I went through some<br>tough times but the biggest thing that I<br>learned from it was that I just have to<br>accept it<br>when I stopped actually suffering from<br>the pain and just actually accepted that<br>this was going to potentially be in my<br>life that was when I had the<br>breakthrough and was able to to manage<br>one idea that I have always had is that<br>life isn't happening to you you are<br>creating it so what I mean by that is I<br>guess you are what you think about often<br>the more negative thoughts that you have<br>the more negative your life's going to<br>turn out and so I always try and think<br>as positive as I can even in the really<br>tough situations it's been one of my<br>strengths I guess and the team<br>especially and my mum I guess growing up<br>kind of installed there to me because<br>she taught me about the law of<br>attraction which is basically this idea<br>that your thoughts become your actions<br>and your actions become things so what I<br>would do is always just tell her put it<br>out put it out there to anyone who would<br>listen what I actually wanted in my life<br>and often people would call me build the<br>luckiest person because I'd always be<br>winning things or getting things or<br>making teams but I really wouldn't put<br>it down to luck I would actually put it<br>down to putting it out there and you<br>know what's the worst thing that can go<br>wrong playing hockey at the top level<br>you do have to deal with the pressure<br>and we do get a lot of comments saying<br>you know you're going to choke this time<br>and that really plays on your head a<br>little bit but I guess the biggest thing<br>that I learned about dealing with<br>pressure is that instead of trying to do<br>something different try to try too hard<br>you just have to let it go and let it<br>happen<br>the biggest tip that I could give is to<br>deal with pressure as mindfulness so the<br>whole idea I know it's been thrown out<br>there but it is being used by the top<br>athletes in the world science has backed<br>it up as well and it's the whole idea of<br>training your mind to be in the present<br>moment so that's not being distracted by<br>your thoughts or feelings or emotions<br>which obviously under pressure it kind<br>of gets sped up a lot but yeah it's not<br>focusing on the past because you can't<br>change it's not focusing on the future<br>because you're not there yet so often<br>you're looking at the score and or the<br>all the time on the clock or you're<br>thinking about a past mistake you've<br>made but for me being able to practice<br>mindfulness means that I can just be in<br>the game and just focus on my role not<br>get distracted by anyone else and it<br>really helps me get calm and get focused<br>because I think when you resist or you<br>you put too much pressure on yourself<br>that's when things go wrong I often<br>think a lot about what you can control<br>and what you can't control<br>often we spend a lot of time especially<br>as a sports person living in that box of<br>uncontrollables you know the riff what<br>the opposition are doing the weather how<br>hot it is all of these things that you<br>just have absolutely no control over and<br>it does no good so what I think is that<br>we need to try and spend most of the<br>time and the control box which you know<br>you can control yourself your thoughts<br>your what you say what you do and if you<br>actually make that switch or actually be<br>aware of these two boxes even to begin<br>with that's a really good step and being<br>able to manage obviously the things that<br>are within your control it's not only in<br>the game when I'm talking about how what<br>you can control but it's everywhere it's<br>how you deal with failure I mean over at<br>the Olympics<br>we lost our semi-final against Great<br>Britain and we had one day to get over<br>it to play the bronze medal match which<br>is the single most important game that<br>we played and so I even had a choice I<br>could stay in the past thinking about<br>all the mistakes I've made or I could<br>quickly move on learn those lessons but<br>move on and focus on the next game so I<br>think when we're talking about what you<br>can control we often just keep replaying<br>situations and our head which to us no<br>good whatsoever I mean it is important<br>to learn those lessons from your<br>mistakes but the more we dwell on them<br>why is such a big word it's throwing one<br>around a lot but I think it's probably<br>the most important question to keep<br>asking yourself you know what's your why<br>I think often when we give in these<br>really tough situations you have to<br>really hold on to that and if it's not a<br>bigger reason if it's nothing special or<br>outside of yourself if it's a selfish<br>reason I think that the the more likely<br>you are just to be on the wrong path so<br>I think the purpose of having a strong<br>sense of y is that when you do get into<br>the situations where you're not sure if<br>you can go on or not but they've may<br>have been in many of those you have that<br>as kind of a guidance don't mean to be<br>cliche but like a torch in the dark you<br>know you can actually steer yourself in<br>the direction you want but for a purpose<br>I like to say you know it's on purpose<br>versus off purpose sometimes I know that<br>a lot of the time we walk around like on<br>autopilot we do things but we're kind of<br>not sure why we do them and I think<br>being taken switching off autopilot and<br>taking control and knowing why you're<br>doing things is a really big reason that<br>I think everyone should should reflect<br>on themselves I could continue you're<br>just being an athlete and that's that's<br>great it's a big big job but what I<br>found is I've launched a new initiative<br>which is actually helping high school<br>athletes try to balance their lives<br>socially mentally and physically and I<br>went through all of that not so long ago<br>and by helping them it's given me a<br>greater sense of purpose there was a lot<br>of times when I was launching my<br>business that I had these doubts because<br>obviously putting my name out there and<br>starting a business you know Who am I to<br>be teaching these kids that's what was<br>going on in my head it was a lot of<br>getting outside my comfort zone and I<br>had to keep reminding myself and bring<br>myself back to you know that why why am<br>I doing this and it's because I want to<br>help and and pass on these skills to<br>potentially have a life-changing effect<br>on these these girls and having the<br>right attitude definitely helps you get<br>outside your comfort zone<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
