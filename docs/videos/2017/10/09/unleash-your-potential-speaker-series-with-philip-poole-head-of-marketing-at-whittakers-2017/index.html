chocolate<br>Whitakers I'll give you a brief history<br>of Whitaker's and then I'll I'll talk<br>about a few of the principles that we<br>follow and let me tell you from the<br>outset there's no silver bullets in all<br>of this it's it's the result I think of<br>a very very sort of hard work and the<br>result of Andrew and Brian the current<br>directors of the business you know<br>really committed to growing and<br>producing high-quality chocolate<br>world-class chocolate the vision that we<br>have at Whitaker's and I can ambition<br>you know whatever you like to call it is<br>the world loving world-class chocolate<br>from Peru and that's what drives<br>everything so everything about the<br>business has to be world-class the<br>company was founded in 1896 by James<br>Henry Whittaker and he had emigrated<br>from from the UK I had lived in<br>Macclesfield and none of you would have<br>been to Macclesfield oh you have now you<br>know why no way left it there<br>and in a riot in New Zealand in 1890 and<br>set up Whitaker's in 1896 in<br>Christchurch it then moved to to<br>Wellington and the factory was in the<br>centre of Wellington just off Vivian<br>Street and it moved to the current site<br>in 1969 in pori row and it was on one<br>section and subsequently we've bought<br>the section next door which has got a<br>big warehouse on it and a couple of<br>about 18 months ago we bought the<br>section the other side so we are fully<br>committed to New Zealand we're not<br>moving to China Thailand Australia<br>anywhere we're fully committed to New<br>Zealand and we've invested a lot in the<br>factory and we're continuing to invest<br>the company is still New Zealand own<br>Andrew and Brian are the current<br>directors and they are third generation<br>whiticus there our fourth generation<br>Whitaker's in the business Holly<br>Whitaker is marketing manager Matt<br>Whitaker that Lisa Andrews children Matt<br>Whitaker is in charge of the<br>international business so their fourth<br>generation in there both Matt and Holly<br>have young children as well very young<br>children so there's a 5th generation<br>coming through so the the dynasty will<br>continue so let me show you this first<br>chart now I show you this chart for two<br>reasons the first reason is the the<br>winner of the most trusted brand the<br>second and third companies are normally<br>sort of Sony Toyota Samsung although<br>these they've slipped a bit it is big<br>multinational companies much bigger than<br>them Whitaker's and but you know size<br>doesn't always count you know we we have<br>a very strict sort of policy on on<br>quality of the product and I think<br>that's why we win this this award we're<br>also the most loved brand<br>which brand do you reckon comes number<br>two in the most love brand that's your<br>blacks it's your blacks so we're the<br>only team in the world that continually<br>beat so we're very proud of that and<br>it's a chart I love showing that's the<br>second reason I show it I like it<br>and and everybody in the company is very<br>proud of that and we probably we don't<br>celebrate success as well as we should<br>do but for the last few years when we've<br>won that we've taken a whole company out<br>out to lunch so you know it's and it's<br>it's an award that is it goes back to<br>that I think to the heart of the company<br>it is a family company and you know that<br>the people that work there are very<br>proud to work there so let's talk a few<br>about a few of the principles if you<br>think about<br>whiticus or think about most consumer<br>markets in new zealand the consumer is<br>bombarded with choice you know the<br>consumer problem is choice is not one of<br>supply<br>you know most most products are in good<br>supply it's a it's it's it's one of<br>choice and whiticus is up against<br>Cadbury Nestle lint and Mars for huge<br>multinational companies much bigger than<br>us much bigger resources and and they're<br>you know blue chip companies you know<br>very good companies so we have to make<br>sure that what we do is better than what<br>they do otherwise we won't survive we'll<br>we'll just you know what we'll just sink<br>so successful brands build a strong<br>brand culture consumers like to be in a<br>community and you're all in a community<br>now and brought together by a brand<br>called Auckland University strong brands<br>acts like magnets and they build these<br>communities around them<br>and what they do is though the people in<br>those communities what we say is we want<br>to move move people from being<br>spectators there's people that are we're<br>of the brand to supporters and<br>supporters of a brand will not go to<br>another brand you know so it's very very<br>important to build those those<br>supporters many years ago I used to work<br>for Unilever and during what one of the<br>companies I worked for the CEO was an<br>accountant he's worse than that was a<br>Dutch accountant<br>no Dutch accountants in the audience<br>that's good I think come across one and<br>audience once but so anyway he was at<br>Thatcher accountant so I went into his<br>office one day I said I need a meeting<br>with you next Tuesday no witness day<br>know what can I meet you on Thursday<br>no that's the type of conversation<br>dynamic conversation you used to head<br>with him<br>and I said oh why can't I see you next<br>week then I'm away oh holiday no<br>business nap<br>get a bit irritated by them I said well<br>where are you going<br>you said I'm going to a convention I<br>thought a chartered accountants<br>and I'm sorry you know a bit mother and<br>I said oh you're going to chartered<br>accountants convention no he said I'm<br>going to a Harley Davidson convention<br>well you know he must have seen the look<br>on my face and he started talking about<br>Harley Davidson and he almost became<br>animated you know for a second<br>and he told me how when he was at<br>university in Amsterdam he bought a<br>Harley Davidson that's the first one he<br>had and ever since then and he'd always<br>owned a Harley Davidson and every year<br>he were wherever he was in the world you<br>know he went to he tried to get to the<br>Harley Davidson convention and and you<br>know again I had to bite my lip because<br>you can imagine it you know this dull<br>boring gray Unilever accountant would<br>change his suit and put on his Harley<br>leathers and for one week a year and you<br>know he'd go to this convention at the<br>convention there'd be company directors<br>bikers gang members and you know<br>goodness knows who and but the important<br>thing is Harley Davidson acted as a<br>magnet and it drove and it drew all of<br>those people into it it does anybody<br>here owned a Harley and I guarantee how<br>I don't know anything about motorbikes<br>but I guarantee that you know if you<br>owned a Harley Davidson you're not going<br>to buy a Honda or Suzuki or whatever<br>because you're a supporter of that brand<br>and the thing and again I don't know the<br>technical details about motorbikes but<br>you know the thing that really separates<br>Harley Davidson from those other<br>motorbikes is the emotional driver it's<br>all about the freedom of the road which<br>was encapsulated in a film in the late<br>60s and I'm looking around the audience<br>and probably well done well done good<br>you know normally when I'm doing this<br>you know our generation is not well<br>represented<br>nobody's seen the film but it's it's it<br>was and let's again emotional drivers<br>are so important because rational<br>aspects of a brand can be copied the<br>emotional ones are unique and as I say<br>harley-davidson has this emotional sort<br>of freedom of the road<br>so this Unilever guy for one week a year<br>he's free you know and and he goes out<br>to it and drives his Harley around so<br>very important to build a culture and we<br>do build a strong culture with with<br>Whitaker's because we are a family<br>company we are New Zealand but above all<br>we are fanatical about the quality of<br>the product and it's chocolate you know<br>it's a small indulgence you know you're<br>going to eat it you're gonna put it in<br>your mouth you do not want to be<br>disappointed you know in quality is<br>absolutely critical and that's how we<br>and we're the only major chocolate<br>company in New Zealand that do the whole<br>manufacturing post process import the<br>cocoa beans the whole process whole nine<br>yards through the end product and we do<br>that it probably cheaper for us to<br>import cocoa liquor because there's<br>companies in the around the world who<br>specialize in in producing cocoa liquor<br>and because of the economies of scale<br>they've got it's cheaper but you can<br>never ever guarantee the quality you<br>know by doing it yourself you guarantee<br>the quality so you know and you know<br>it's chocolate people put it in the<br>mouth put palm oil in it people will<br>pick it up you know and quickly you know<br>everybody's an expert on chocolate<br>and it's it's people notice a change and<br>very quickly so you build a brown build<br>a strong brain culture and build strong<br>relationships with customers the best<br>way to build a relationship with your<br>customer get the product quality right<br>but then build a strong relationship<br>with the customers through storytelling<br>all brands all great brands have good<br>stories behind them and with Whitaker's<br>we focus very much on what we call what<br>is unique to whiticus first of all the<br>bean to bar and that is a signal of<br>quality as again you know Cadbury Nestle<br>Mars cannot claim bean to bar in New<br>Zealand where we are family and and<br>canoes eland and with with the New<br>Zealand this we we don't want people to<br>buy<br>whiticus chocolate because it's a New<br>Zealand brand you know I think it's a<br>bit pathetic really we want them to buy<br>it because it's the best quality<br>chocolate and they love the quality of<br>the chocolate the fact that it's a New<br>Zealand brand helps you know is another<br>added factor and family family is<br>important because generally family-owned<br>companies and family driven companies<br>have they're just a more detailed more<br>passion more energy going into the<br>quality of the product you know I've<br>worked for multinationals and I work for<br>family companies and I can tell you you<br>know the focus on quality and family<br>companies is is far greater<br>I'm not saying multinationals you know<br>that don't focus on you know don't they<br>look at quality but you know compare us<br>with Cadbury so build strong<br>relationships with the customers through<br>the storytelling and ideally you know<br>have unique properties that you can tell<br>to to the cust to the customers<br>I will talk about some of the the sort<br>of I guess are sort of the aspects of<br>what we do at Whitaker's in building the<br>company first always you know company<br>must have a clear vision and everybody<br>in the company must understand that<br>vision and the vision must be I think<br>ambitious and you know and everybody if<br>everybody understands it as the ambition<br>that everybody works to water and as I<br>say our ambition is to the world loving<br>world-class chocolate from Pororo so and<br>and the sort of the the essence of that<br>is world-class world-class chocolate and<br>as I say that sort of drives everything<br>else and we wouldn't survive or prosper<br>unless we sort of really sort of focused<br>on that and the world loving means we<br>are we are very strong in New Zealand<br>but we do have ambitions to develop an<br>international business it will be slow<br>it will be slow because you know by<br>definition a company based a consumer<br>goods company based in New Zealand any<br>other marketing scam because going into<br>is going to be bigger you know and we<br>are coming off a small base but we are<br>gradually building our business so we<br>are in a lot of the Asian countries<br>we're now in Canada we're in China we're<br>in Walmart in China so little by little<br>we're building the brand in in that in<br>international markets area but it will<br>take time but it will take time but<br>that's the vision and in doing that we<br>will never ever lose the the world-class<br>aspiration because that is its very<br>important values again that the value of<br>the company is is really comes back to<br>the quality and we always say we do not<br>we have a product called a sandy Bahr<br>and guess what we cut the corner now<br>this is where Bryan and Andrew are very<br>clever and going back to that world<br>class aspect sandy Bahr was was sold in<br>dairies it has been sold in that was<br>sold in those four years unwrapped now<br>we wanted to get it into supermarkets<br>you can have it in supermarkets wrapped<br>so what we did or what that Andrew<br>branded was to find a machine that would<br>wrap a sandy bar now if any engineers or<br>packaging people amongst you will know<br>that's wrecking something with a curved<br>end like that is very difficult very<br>difficult and in the end they searched<br>the world and found a machine in Italy<br>took it back to two Wellington and I<br>think you know in typical New Zealand<br>fashion made a few amendments to it and<br>made it work they sent these products to<br>Italy and said your machine is wonderful<br>it's patently sandy bars now Italians<br>couldn't believe it I think they even<br>sent somebody out just to make sure that<br>it was true but again the important<br>point is now the accountants would have<br>said well square up the end you know the<br>production efficiencies will be much<br>better<br>everything would be a lot easier the<br>machine will be cheaper and everybody be<br>happy apart from the consumer and this<br>an accountant you know don't get me<br>wrong you know accountant said overall<br>and that they were right to ask the<br>question but what they do they ask the<br>question but they missed the point<br>because the whole pneumonic of this<br>brand was that curve and Cadbury's have<br>had a whack at this over a number of<br>years they've brought out a you know<br>sort of stick like this guess what the<br>ends cover the ends square that and so<br>the product the product didn't have any<br>identity you know that whole curve is<br>the identity of that product and you<br>know and the history of the product so<br>it goes back to the values you know it<br>goes back to world class and<br>defending the values not only of the<br>company but of the products the<br>individual products as well so and very<br>successful very successful in fact you<br>know that the problem that we have is<br>it's it's what we can't really sort of<br>meet and demand for that but you know<br>again it's it's it's that you know if<br>you'd squared at the end it wouldn't<br>taste it wouldn't taste any different<br>but it would lose that identity don't<br>listen to the accountants so values<br>strong identity this was the first pact<br>that we had in gold this was wrapped<br>again this was was was launched in the<br>early fifties unwrapped and sold in in<br>in in there is four foot four years we<br>wanted to get into supermarkets so we<br>had to wrap it and it was wrapped in<br>1984 and that was the first gold wrap<br>and gold is is is very much so sort of<br>that the color of the brand because<br>again you know if you're shopping in<br>supermarkets and they don't really like<br>it and and you're up against a lot of<br>other products so you want to have a<br>clear strong identity when you go to the<br>chocolate section we we say what we try<br>and achieve and we say we want you know<br>with all the blocks merchandise we want<br>a wall of gold because then people can<br>easily identify the whiticus product<br>product we want a wall of gold yeah<br>there might be little water purple next<br>to it but all that<br>so the strong identity is very very<br>important and you know gold is is very<br>much that the brand color which is you<br>know a premium color denotes a sort of<br>premium product and we're very very sort<br>of strict strict on that and because<br>strong identity is particularly<br>important in in supermarkets positioning<br>this is how people perceive the brand<br>not only in their hearts but in their<br>minds and often the heart is it's more<br>important and that than the mind so when<br>we position the brand we talk about<br>bean-to-bar<br>because that's very much shorthand for<br>quality you know people realize that if<br>you're spending that amount of detail in<br>in roasting the beans and you know the<br>beans are roasted for a certain amount<br>of time there's some magic there which<br>Brian and Andrew have developed over the<br>years so they are you know very very<br>strict on on that quality and so bean<br>stir bar is important the family is<br>important because again what that<br>communicates about that the quality the<br>effort and the enthusiasm that goes into<br>the product so most of our advertising<br>is signed off from Adrian Brian and<br>again the New Zealand part is it is<br>important as well and also we certainly<br>sort of underpin that with that with the<br>the quality of the ingredients that we<br>put in only used Ghana and cocoa beans<br>and all of the ingredients that we put<br>in we have higher percentage of<br>inclusions than other brands so if you<br>look at our patient that product for<br>example it's got a high percentage of<br>hazelnuts in it<br>the Cadbury product and then that's true<br>across all of the that the products so<br>again that goes back to sort of the<br>positioning of the brand in people's<br>minds it's better quality in one of the<br>focus groups we did many years ago and<br>focus groups with chocolate are very<br>interesting because you have to<br>segregate them you cannot have males and<br>females in the same group because<br>females have this sort of slight guilt<br>complex about chocolate and if there's<br>males in the group that they won't talk<br>if it's just females in the group they<br>do talk and for many years when I was<br>working with Unilever I I worked on<br>product categories like detergent<br>toothpaste deodorants things like that<br>and if you did a focus group they would<br>last probably about two hours by which<br>time it was dragging a bit because<br>there's only so much you can say about<br>detergent really the first one that we<br>did with with chocolate at the end of<br>three hours the the moderator of the<br>group came out said you know we've got<br>enough information and poor woman she<br>was absolutely exhausted because there<br>about eight women in this group and<br>they've been consuming chocolate<br>daughter all the way for us and and that<br>and there were some lovely comments<br>comment came out of it firstly it was we<br>would it was when we were launching a<br>square squares product and it's ten and<br>a half grams squares ten and a half<br>grams of chocolate the moments one<br>months at all it's done enough grams of<br>chocolate that's fabulous I can eat as<br>many as I like I could never sort quite<br>work out the logic and then another<br>woman said oh it's really love whiticus<br>products and you know that they're so<br>generous these that are like whiticus<br>products because they've got bigger and<br>I don't think we can use that in<br>advertising anyway so positioning and<br>vert very very important communication<br>is critical if you think about the the<br>vision the values the identity and the<br>positioning communication successful<br>communication brings all of those<br>together and very much builds the the<br>bridge to the consumer so it's very very<br>critical in building that relationship<br>to the consumer many must mean that five<br>or six years ago now we launched the<br>creamy milk product with a five role<br>refined process and I won't go into all<br>the detail but the process of refining<br>it through five rollers gives you a<br>smoother product a nicer mouthfeel and<br>and just an overall better quality and<br>again this is where Andrew and Brian are<br>really clever because Whitaker's never<br>had a problem with quality and which is<br>true you know it's better quality than<br>the other protein obviously I'm biased<br>but it's because it's better it's better<br>qualities got 33 percent cocoa<br>competitor brains won't have as much our<br>dark chocolate doesn't have any milk<br>solids in it so and I think the reason<br>for that then where's competitive brands<br>do because I think they're using cheaper<br>cocoa beans and they might be slightly<br>more bitter so the milk knocks the<br>flavour back a bit not sure but anyway<br>we do not use milk solids in our dark<br>chocolate so and if you're a dark<br>chocolate lover and haven't tasted our<br>dark chocolate tasty because it really<br>is fabulous<br>all from Ghanaian cocoa beans so sorry I<br>digress slightly so I'm Brian with the<br>milk chocolate Brian and you had this<br>sort of nagging doubt in the back of<br>their mind if we want to be world-class<br>there's an improvement that we can make<br>by using a five role refine process it<br>will just improve<br>move the the smoothness the mouthfeel of<br>of a product you know just give it a<br>nicer edge and I said well it's not a<br>problem you know quality is not a<br>problem oh no no we think we can do it<br>we can do it that the machinery for this<br>rat runs in on the investment ran into<br>five figures you know it was huge it was<br>huge and but it did improve the quality<br>of the chocolate now from a<br>communication point of view really<br>difficult because if people are happy<br>with the product they think it's better<br>than the other products on the market<br>the last thing they want you to do is<br>change it why change it you know I like<br>your product you know it's it's better I<br>like it why change it because we can<br>make it even better<br>well you know but I'm you know I'm not<br>sure that I want you to do then so we<br>the communication was very very<br>difficult we explained to the agency<br>that we were improving the product and<br>the communication had to convince people<br>that they needed to try this product<br>because it had been improved even though<br>they liked what they were eating at the<br>time most difficult problem to you know<br>to actually do in communications if<br>you've got a problem with the product<br>and you say you know we've improved the<br>product we put enzymes in it or blue<br>specs or whatever it is with detergents<br>you know we've improved it it'll make<br>your washing whiter you know try easy<br>story and you know it's a simple story<br>this one was very difficult so the<br>agency and I give credit to the agency<br>our accountant didn't they came up and<br>they said there's only one person in the<br>world that can convince people to buy<br>this new improved chocolate he said oh<br>who's that<br>it's Nigella Lawson oh god you know and<br>and and when you think about it you know<br>and we thought about it for two minutes<br>really but that's it longer you know you<br>want to communicate<br> which is a smoky no indulgence<br>smooth and Nigella is ideal to do that<br>because he is slightly indulgent very<br>smooth and the rest you know and and the<br>good thing about Nigella is she is very<br>very popular not only with she's popular<br>with eat with everybody not only females<br>but males as well and probably for<br>different reasons but very very popular<br>and ideal to communicate chocolate<br>values we told the accountant and<br>because as you can imagine angela is not<br>cheap so he told the accountant and told<br>him how much it was going to cost and he<br>went quite white and when he sort of<br>recovered he said oh well what's the ROI<br>going to be on Niger only in a counter<br>you can reduce the Nigella an hour and I<br>said I don't know I don't know it but<br>and I can make out some figures you know<br>if you want you know but I just don't<br>know but what we can say is that since<br>she advertised this initially and this<br>is now the number one SKU in in the<br>chocolate market now five years ago if<br>your just said to me and I'm chief<br>marketing officer of whiticus would<br>Whitaker's creamy milk be a higher<br>seller than Cadbury Dairy Milk which has<br>been around for years you know part of<br>New Zealand history part of the culture<br>and everything would it be a higher<br>seller you know I'm not sure that I<br>would have spit my house on it you know<br>but anyway it did it did and you know<br>and we have used Nigella very<br>successfully to launch the this is the<br>the artisan range which is using<br>obviously British chocolate but using<br>artisan companies from around New<br>Zealand<br>great into the chocolate so this one has<br>got Marvel sea salt and caramel brittle<br>which is fabulous you hadn't tried that<br>fabulous and the game we use Nigella and<br>in that hundred gram market and we just<br>launched a new range which is called the<br>destinations range and so this range is<br>using artisan producers from New Zealand<br>with the destinations range we've<br>actually got out to the world so we are<br>bringing artisan products to New Zealand<br>no-expense-spared again though if you<br>think about it we want to be world class<br>you know and it's it's been interesting<br>this is the Italian Piedmont Paisner so<br>the hazelnuts come from Piedmont<br>initially very very expensive girl I<br>think that's what was one of the<br>original areas that peanuts were grown<br>you know and and but again you know we<br>searched the world and that's where we<br>we got those peanuts from peanuts<br>hazelnuts from so again if you want to<br>be world-class you have to and and this<br>hundred gram range if you think about<br>this hundred gram range the the major<br>brand in the hundred gram sector was<br>lint and lint a very good company very<br>good quality chocolate very well<br>marketed and we have gone in there and<br>they had 70 percent of that market<br>before we went in there 70 75 percent of<br>the market because there's no other<br>competitors they've now got about 30 and<br>we've got about 40 that is the value of<br>that's it and he go masa masa masa but<br>she's expensive can we get somebody<br>cheaper of course we could we could we<br>could get so many - we did have a bit of<br>slight criticism in in using Nigella<br>because she's obviously not New Zealand<br>and we're in New Zealand Brent and one<br>or two people said well you know why<br>didn't you use a New Zealand foodie and<br>and don't get me wrong there's some very<br>good foodie what if he's not being a<br>food people in New Zealand but I don't<br>think any of them a world-class yet they<br>wouldn't have the world-class reputation<br>of Nigella they may do in the future you<br>know they may do but I'm not sure that<br>they would have the same impact as<br>Nigella does at the moment and I'll say<br>that may change in the future but you<br>know we're talking about now so but to<br>go in and and take that type of market<br>share away from lint you know it goes<br>back to great product great quality<br>product and you know great communication<br>using Nigella and and that's the value<br>you know trouble with accountants only<br>look at cost you know you have to look<br>at value you have to look at value so<br>communication very very important so in<br>all of this what have we learnt<br>you know and there's that there's a<br>number of key lessons coming out of this<br>for us and and I think it you know it<br>applies to the Whitaker's business but I<br>think it is their general and I think<br>they apply to a lot of businesses the<br>first thing you have to have a strong<br>brand you know and no matter all the<br>studies that have been done around the<br>world about successful profitable<br>companies the strength of the brand is<br>always paramount<br>you know have a strong brand understand<br>what your rational values are but even<br>more so understand what your emotional<br>drivers are because your emotional<br>drivers will be the unique values of<br>your brand and you must have a strong<br>brand because you're in you know you're<br>in competition there will be other<br>brands coming in and you know you just<br>want to be very very strong now the next<br>point in intuition and talent it's a bit<br>difficult to explain<br>we do not do any consumer research that<br>and don't get me wrong I'm not saying<br>you know consumer research is not<br>relevant but we do not do any consumer<br>research because you know our philosophy<br>is we should know our business and you<br>should know your business better than<br>anybody else certainly better than<br>consumers you know and and I think you<br>know and I'm marketing people at<br>dreadful fit for this they tend to hide<br>behind consumer research and companies<br>tinder to hide behind mists of consumer<br>research you know you often hear people<br>say oh I'm not sure what you want to do<br>you know a few ideas<br>let's ask consumers about it but if you<br>don't know consumers aren't going to<br>know you know your business is life and<br>death you it's not life and death to<br>consumers you know if your business<br>fails you don't get any money<br>and you don't eat you know with<br>consumers you know if you think about<br>toothpaste or you know it's that it's<br>not the biggest decision of their day<br>you know so we we rely a lot on<br>intuition and it goes back to talent you<br>know if you're going to follow that you<br>have to have very talented people<br>working on your business and we were<br>very careful in the selection of our<br>people and we invest in them heavily so<br>in in the mark on the market<br>side we've got two marketing managers<br>one Jasmine Griffin and and the other is<br>Holly Whitaker and I would have employed<br>Holly even if her name wasn't Whitaker<br>because she had spent she'd gone through<br>University and she'd spent time in<br>London working as an art director for<br>Saatchi and Saatchi in London now<br>anybody that knows the London<br>advertising scene will know you have to<br>be very talented and very tough to<br>survive in that I think you know notice<br>period is 24 hours you know if you're<br>lucky very very tough and she did very<br>well in that so we have two marketing<br>managers both of them have been to<br>Stanford because it's the best Business<br>School in the world now I know where I'm<br>standing and again you know probably a<br>brave thing to say stand in here isn't<br>it but I think you know the people at<br>Auckland business school and Oakland<br>will admit at the moment Stanford has a<br>better reputation than Auckland<br>you know and in the future that may<br>change that may change you know but at<br>the moment again it goes back to world<br>class you know Stanford this world class<br>is Auckland world class at the moment<br>I'm not sure and it may change you know<br>and it make it make make it a bit better<br>but you know we invest heavily in those<br>people because we expect them to use<br>their intuition you know and you could<br>say you know it's it's it's the way that<br>we do it rightly or wrongly you know<br>it's it's it's the way that we do it and<br>I suspect we are a bit different in that<br>way and we're not a convener and this is<br>another thing that may seem a bit<br>strange we're not a consumer lid company<br>you know and and I again I think people<br>get this wrong in in that you know you<br>see these grateful heads which say oh we<br>have listened to the consumer and this<br>is what<br>doing now a new thing and normally it's<br>after the company's made a massive<br>mistake you know and we we have this is<br>very much Jasmine's area 700,000 people<br>on on Facebook that is an enormous slice<br>of the company out of New Zealand<br>because chocolate and and we're lucky<br>because chocolate is an interesting<br>category and we have you know there's a<br>dialogue with them continually and you<br>learn and all fall up that way you know<br>we so that's if you like that's our<br>consumer research we we have a<br>relationship with a consumer we're not<br>consumer let I'm not sure if that makes<br>sense but you know because consumers<br>don't know what they want you know they<br>just don't and and so you know that<br>that's the way that we run it which may<br>be different and and you know you may<br>say that's wrong may say it's right but<br>you know it's it's it's the way that we<br>do it so intuition and talent is very<br>important and they go together you know<br>you know your business better than<br>consumers you know what you want to do<br>more than consumers you know have their<br>you know you know have the courage to do<br>it you know take the consumers along<br>with you don't wait for them to tell you<br>what to do if you wait for them to tell<br>you what to do you'll be behind all the<br>time speed we like to do things quickly<br>so quick that the accountant can't stop<br>us that I think speed is important and<br>and let me tell you this<br>some years ago there was we had an ad on<br>TV when the palm oil thing came up there<br>was net on TV a pack shot pretty good<br>picture of Khepri and going through a<br>list of things that they've done list of<br>things that we've done that whole ad<br>took because we've seen what they what<br>they had had done and we thought well<br>you know consumers<br>about this and the whole air took two<br>days to write conceive shoot and get on<br>air because there was an opportunity<br>there there was a moment in time there<br>was an opportunity so if you see that<br>you've got to seize it you know and it<br>was very successful<br>it was very successful say oh shut up 35<br>percent over the next few weeks the good<br>thing about it was what it what it gave<br>Whitaker's was a huge sampling campaign<br>I can believe a number of people at<br>hidden tribe whiticus you know me got<br>all these people coming back so you know<br>I just try pretty cuz it's fabulous and<br>you think what's been around for a<br>hundred years I tried it before but it<br>gave us a huge shot sampling campaign<br>and what was good was the sales didn't<br>just go and come back down again<br>because it went back to the quality of<br>the product you know the quality of the<br>people tried it they perceived it was<br>better and stable and if you look at the<br>the Whitaker's market share in the block<br>market that's in this market over the<br>last probably sort of ten years twelve<br>years it's quadrupled and we haven't<br>done it on price we've done it on<br>quality our product sales are the<br>premium to keppra this product sells at<br>a premium to lint you know because we<br>are not price driven we're quality<br>driven and it will always be that way<br>well as long as I'm there you know it<br>will it will always be that way because<br>in the end if your price driven somebody<br>will always come in lower than you you<br>know always happens I know so intuition<br>talent speed and take risks you know you<br>have to take risks and and I always<br>think taking risk is the fun part of the<br>business<br>but you know if the intuition and talent<br>is right the risk is reduced<br>you don't really reduce risk by doing<br>market research you know you came a bit<br>I and that's another thing you know<br>we're marketing people get market<br>research wrong they want to reduce the<br>risk so they say right we do some market<br>research and ask the consumer you know<br>and a lot of the time it fails and<br>people will say oh this is failed and<br>that's at well you know and the defense<br>for marketing is well research said this<br>you know I think what doesn't matter<br>what research says it's failed so I<br>think you know if you're using research<br>just be very careful what you're using<br>it for just say why are you using it why<br>can't I answer the question why haven't<br>I got the confidence to answer the<br>questions</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
