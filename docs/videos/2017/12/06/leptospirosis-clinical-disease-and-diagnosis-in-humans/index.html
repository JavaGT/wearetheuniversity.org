Humans become infected through contact with contaminated animal urine. Leptospirosis presents as a flu-like illness, although severe illness can result in very different syndromes, ranging from kidney and liver failure to severe pulmonary hemorrhagic syndrome to aseptic meningitis. Most illness is mild, but 5-15% progress to multi-organ failure. Diagnosis is challenging due to the myriad of clinical symptoms and similarity to other infectious diseases. Early treatment can lessen the severity of leptospirosis, so prompt diagnosis is critical. Serology is the most common diagnostic method, but the gold standard assay is cumbersome and difficult to perform. Detection of DNA by PCR is confirmatory, but the window for optimal specimen collection is very narrow due to the transient nature of Leptospira in the bloodstream. A multifaceted approach using both serology and molecular detection is recommended for the diagnosis of leptospirosis.<br><br>http://www.otago.ac.nz/global-health/index.html</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

I<br>just this is supposed to be a Christmas<br>special medical form and so there is a<br>prize here of grape juice that might<br>have been fermented for whoever can tell<br>me at the end after Rene spoken who<br>these two prominent former University of<br>Otago Medical School leptospirosis<br>researchers and I hope this this doesn't<br>distract you too much during the coming<br>45 minutes if no one gets it right the<br>prize goes to Rene and I've told Rene<br>already that New Zealanders are very<br>polite<br>so everyone probably knows the answer<br>but they're not saying so that she can<br>have the wine anyway I'll show you them<br>again later on so it's my pleasure to<br>introduce Rene Galloway who's a<br>long-standing collaborator<br>at the US Centers for Disease Control<br>and Prevention she earned a Bachelor of<br>Science degree in medical technology<br>from University of Minnesota in a<br>master's in public health from Emory<br>University she spent five years working<br>as a bacteriologist with the state<br>public health department in the US in a<br>sense of in a number of roles and<br>several laboratories at the US Centers<br>for Disease Control and Prevention<br>including bioterrorism response whole<br>genome sequencing identification of<br>unknown bacteria that caused systemic<br>infections in humans and influenza she<br>currently holds the position of<br>microbiologist and the zoo in Oh season<br>select agent<br>poetry and the special pathogens branch<br>at the CDC and she's the US CDC subject<br>matter is expert for leptospirosis she's<br>also a commander in the US Public Health<br>Service or not wearing a uniform today<br>and she's received awards for work on<br>bioterrorism hurricane response<br>influenza response surveillance that<br>despereaux's this outbreak response and<br>for development of an identification<br>scheme for Leptospira as I mentioned<br>earlier she's been with her colleague<br>atelic Hoff master who just spoke over<br>at microbiology have been very kind<br>collaborators for a number of years on<br>leptospirosis work in Tanzania and have<br>also hosted University of Otago PhD<br>student Mike maize who's here at CDC<br>Pullip dysbiosis work so without further<br>ado invite Renee to speak to us on net<br>Despero cisterna core diagnosis humans<br>thank you John<br>this is the first time I've worn a lapel<br>mic so hopefully you can all hear me and<br>I hope I don't end up dropping this but<br>I'm connected to a wire so that's<br>different<br>thank you thank you so much for having<br>me I really want to extend a huge thanks<br>to John Crump and Mike maze for<br>graciously hosting and for bringing us<br>here to Dunedin it's it's been gorgeous<br>and a wonderful visit so excited to be<br>here I'm going to talk about<br>leptospirosis clinical disease and and<br>diagnosis in humans I did not put any<br>clues in my talk about the identity of<br>the scientists so you probably all might<br>fail the quiz at the end but maybe not<br>there are no clues okay so just a little<br>bit of background about leptospirosis<br>it's the most widespread zoonosis in the<br>world and that is due to the very very<br>vast variety of mammal carriers that<br>harbor it and their kidneys and shed it<br>in their urine so they can<br>the environment and spread it all over<br>the world<br>there are so many different species of<br>mammals that carry it but the most<br>common are cattle dogs and feral swine<br>and the rodent is actually the mammal<br>that is most responsible for the most<br>leptospirosis around the world<br>so in cattle it causes abortions and low<br>milk production<br>dogs get clinical illness from it and<br>there are vaccines for dogs and cattle<br>but not a vaccine for humans so leftist<br>broses very common in areas that have<br>seasonal flooding and heavy rains and<br>poor sanitation so most of these areas<br>have rodent infestations so the rodents<br>maintain it in the environment and<br>contaminate the flood waters and humans<br>so not only is it associated with areas<br>of poor sanitation in developing<br>countries but it's also found in<br>developed countries and has been more in<br>more recent years associated with water<br>sporting events such as rafting or<br>canoeing and these pictures are from an<br>adventure race that took place in<br>Florida in 2005 where they had an<br>outbreak of leptospirosis among the<br>athletes and the race occurred in the<br>Florida swamp waters that also had<br>evidence of feral pigs rooting in the<br>mud and it followed Hurricane Wilma<br>which brought a lot of heavy rains and<br>flooding there so a little bit about the<br>microbiology of Leptospira it's a<br>gram-negative spirochete it's long and<br>it's very very thin so it cannot be<br>viewed with a Gram stain you have to<br>view it using dark field microscopy or<br>there's a silver stain that you can use<br>to view it<br>it also has characteristic hooked ends<br>known as a Shepherd's hook and you can<br>see it in the bottom picture below it's<br>also been called a question mark<br>and when they they have very<br>characteristic motility under the<br>microscope so they they kind of spin on<br>its axis super super fast so it's very<br>characteristic to see these hooked ends<br>and a rapid spinning and they're divided<br>into pathogenic intermediate and<br>saprophytic species so this just shows<br>the three different groups of species<br>the sacrifice do not cause any human<br>illness or animal illness that they're<br>found in the environment intermediately<br>pathogenic species have been known to<br>cause mild or limited illness limited<br>self-limiting fevers but are normally<br>not a concern there have been two cases<br>in the literature about 15 years ago<br>maybe that found two intermediates that<br>cause very severe leptospirosis but<br>those are the only two documented cases<br>and since then we haven't seen any<br>severe illness from intermediates the<br>pathogens cause human disease and animal<br>disease and ELINT arrogance is the<br>species that's most widespread and it's<br>the most common species that is<br>implicated in severe illness so clinical<br>presentation that patients often present<br>with very general nonspecific symptoms<br>and headache fever rapid onset of fever<br>headache and myalgias are the most<br>common presentation so it's very general<br>and often is misdiagnosed as a viral<br>infection most cases are are mild but in<br>about ten percent of humans it causes<br>severe illness with a fairly high<br>mortality rate patients get very<br>jaundiced and develop kidney dysfunction<br>which leads to kidney and liver failure<br>and this is known as the classical and<br>is the most common presentation of<br>severe leptospirosis<br>there are also some atypical<br>presentations I wanted to brush on and<br>those are severe pulmonary hemorrhagic<br>syndrome meningitis and chronic kidney<br>disease<br>and I'll touch on those in a bit but<br>wanted to mention treatment for<br>leptospirosis so in the late stage of<br>leptospirosis antibiotic treatment<br>doesn't seem to show much of an effect<br>probably because by that stage in the<br>illness it's very much an amine immune<br>mediated illness so supportive therapies<br>are required and much more effective<br>than antibiotic treatment late in the<br>severe phase but research has shown that<br>early antibiotic treatment can decrease<br>the severity or the duration of illness<br>so early diagnosis is very important so<br>that early treatment can begin and<br>hopefully that can prevent progression<br>to severe illness all right so back to<br>the atypical presentations<br>leptospirosis was implicated as the<br>cause of severe pulmonary hemorrhagic<br>syndrome in 1995 in an outbreak in<br>Nicaragua it has an extremely high<br>mortality rate and a very rapid decline<br>in health for patients and if you can<br>see in the the lung pictured on the<br>right below the lung tissue is almost<br>liquefied because of the severe tissue<br>injury caused by the organism and it's<br>been very commonly reported in Brazil as<br>well as parts of Asia and we hadn't seen<br>it in the US until about a year ago when<br>two workers at a vivarium that sold live<br>birds and butchered them on site were<br>diagnosed with leptospirosis with<br>pulmonary syndrome symptoms and<br>unfortunately one of them died from<br>pulmonary complications and a third<br>worker or a third patient was diagnosed<br>with leptospirosis he was not an<br>employee of the vivarium but lived about<br>two miles from the vivarium in the same<br>area of the Bronx New York where the the<br>previous two cases occurred and it was<br>known to be infested with rodents so<br>they were assumed to be the<br>years of the illness so leptospirosis<br>has long been documented to be a cause<br>of meningitis but it's extremely under<br>diagnosed because it's very often is<br>classified as a viral infection so the<br>organism doesn't grow on conventional<br>Culture Media so often the patients are<br>diagnosed with aseptic meningitis and<br>don't receive proper treatment we were<br>involved in a case of chronic meningitis<br>in a 12 year boy who went on a mission<br>trip to Puerto Rico and upon returning<br>three months later he presented to the<br>ER with fever headache and uveitis and<br>he was sent home with treatment for the<br>uveitis but symptoms progressively got<br>worse over time he had repeated visits<br>to the physician and was hospitalized<br>three times on his third hospitalization<br>he had to be placed into a medically<br>induced coma to deal with seizures to<br>try to control his seizures and it was<br>during that third hospitalization and he<br>was finally diagnosed with leptospirosis<br>when they detected sequences of lepto in<br>the spinal fluid so they initiated<br>antibiotic treatment and he was able to<br>recover and he was finally released from<br>the hospital 76 days after that day of<br>first admission of that third hospital<br>stay and it was about a year after the<br>appearance of the first symptoms and let<br>those also known to be associated with<br>some other nervous system syndromes such<br>as Bell's palsy or Gyan beret which have<br>been commonly diagnosed after viral<br>illness so we saw case of Bell's palsy<br>in a 14 year old boy whose dog was<br>diagnosed with leptospirosis and he had<br>cared for the dog and also was diagnosed<br>with lepto and upon recovery he<br>developed Bell's palsy after his lepto<br>infection<br>so previous literature have suggested<br>that patients who have recovered from<br>lepto recovered fully and have no<br>chronic complications but we've lately<br>been seeing a little bit more evidence<br>of some chronic issues I just talked<br>about the chronic meningitis in the<br>patient and coming from<br>leptospirosis meeting in Palmerston<br>North last week we heard from a<br>representative from the New Zealand meat<br>workers who had been diagnosed with<br>leptospirosis and he said it took about<br>two years to recover chronic kidney<br>disease is also a very chronic severe<br>illness that has been seen in sugar cane<br>workers in Nicaragua as well as farm<br>workers in Sri Lanka and they are<br>previously healthy young men who<br>developed kidney failure and there's no<br>cure for it so it's fatal<br>there's been no attributable cause 20<br>years later after the discovery of the<br>syndrome and it's been hypothesized that<br>perhaps repeated exposure to lepto in<br>these high stress environments where the<br>workers are in very high temperatures<br>and they become dehydrated but that that<br>might be a contributing factor to this<br>chronic kidney disease there's a theory<br>there's a link but probably a weak link<br>showing that there's a correlation of<br>serological titers to leptospirosis and<br>a marker of kidney damage but more<br>research certainly needs to be gone done<br>to try to determine how much repeated<br>exposures might contribute to any<br>so because these clinical presentations<br>and the syndromes are so different from<br>each other we try to use tools to help<br>us aid in an accurate diagnosis and we<br>use clinical presentation laboratory<br>test results and exposure history to try<br>to make accurate diagnosis so<br>resource-poor areas are the most common<br>places that experience very large<br>outbreaks of leptospirosis and often<br>they don't have a means to test for<br>lepto so some a group from Sri Lanka has<br>developed a diagnostic model scoring<br>system to try to help in diagnosing they<br>picked mathematically seven<br>characteristics that contributed the<br>most to an accurate diagnosis and<br>determined that a score of 14 gave a<br>sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of<br>60% and it may not seem great but it may<br>help in helping distinguish left though<br>from these other viral illnesses in<br>these resource-poor areas and among the<br>characteristics that they used they<br>found that exposure and risk factors was<br>the most contributing factor to correct<br>diagnosis so patient history is<br>extremely important also communication<br>with the veterinary community is very<br>important<br>usually the human and the veterinary<br>departments are very separate however if<br>we're aware of any increases in cases in<br>the animal community we can be better<br>prepared to recognize cases in humans<br>and also just to keep in mind the<br>environmental cues because it's it's<br>well known and well documented that<br>cases increase after flooding and heavy<br>rains<br>a little bit about rapid detection tests<br>these are usually consists of a lateral<br>flow format they work very similar to<br>pregnancy tests where you look for the<br>development of a line so the one on the<br>left there's only one line pink line<br>it's that that's the control line for<br>the cartridge the second has two lines<br>and that means the patient is positive<br>for IgM antibodies to let them so these<br>are very inexpensive they're easy to use<br>it's they're great field tests or for<br>areas that have had no previous testing<br>for lepto they don't require any<br>additional equipment or refrigeration it<br>can be done on from a finger prick so<br>and results are available within 15<br>minutes but the sensitivity for these is<br>usually low because their antibody<br>detection tests and often the patient<br>presents to acutely in order to detect<br>that antibody so depending on when the<br>patient presents they could be they can<br>be very low sensitivity in the acute<br>phase some laboratory methods of<br>diagnosis for left--oh serology which<br>consists of this like the rapid test<br>side i mentioned as well as eliza and<br>microscopic agglutination test is the<br>reference serological diagnostic assay<br>for molecular tests it's usually<br>consists of PCR that detect DNA in the<br>clinical specimens and isolation of the<br>culture which is not done very very<br>frequently as I mentioned before it<br>doesn't grow on conventional culture<br>media so specialized media is required<br>it also incubates at a lower temperature<br>than other microbiological organisms so<br>usually a separate incubator is used and<br>they're very slow growing so it takes<br>one to two months to grow so it's not<br>so Eliza is usually a test that's run at<br>the hospital level because they usually<br>use Eliza for other infectious diseases<br>and it's easy to implement so it detects<br>IgM or IgG these are very high<br>throughput assays so that's helpful in<br>an outbreak situation where you have a<br>large volume of samples but it's still<br>considered a screening test it uses only<br>one antigen to detect antibodies even<br>though they're over 250 known serovars<br>of Leptospira which brings me to the mat<br>or microscopic agglutination test it's<br>which again is the reference standard<br>however it's extremely laborious and<br>cumbersome it consists of a panel of<br>live antigens reacted against serial<br>dilutions of patients sierra so we use a<br>panel of twenty antigens and they are<br>live so they have to be maintained<br>weekly or bi-weekly they've tried to do<br>assays with killed antigen but it<br>doesn't work well so we are need to<br>maintain live antigens the agglutination<br>is read using dark field microscopy and<br>a four-fold rise and titer between acute<br>and convalescent Sierra's considered<br>diagnostic however even though we use a<br>large panel of antigens we can predict<br>the infecting C revoir so this used to<br>be believed that the highest titer was<br>the infecting C revoir but research has<br>shown that that is correct about less<br>than half the time so we really can't<br>predict the infecting Cyril R so our PCR<br>assays usually target genes that are<br>specific to Leptospira and our assay<br>only detects the pathogenic clade and<br>detection of DNA in a clinical specimen<br>is confirmatory although a negative<br>won't tell you that they don't have it<br>and we experience pretty low bacterial<br>load from clinical specimens the<br>organisms are only present in the<br>bloodstream very transiently before they<br>sequester into tissues<br>so the window of opportunity for a<br>positive PCR is very narrow so in<br>building on that window small window of<br>opportunity if you look at the dark blue<br>line which represents the organisms in<br>the bloodstream it Peaks very soon after<br>the onset of fever myalgia but then<br>decreases quite rapidly and as the<br>organisms leave the bloodstream and<br>sequester into the kidneys the light<br>blue line represents the organisms being<br>shed in the urine and so that increases<br>in the convalescent phase and then the<br>light tan line is the antibodies which<br>are is very insensitive in the acute<br>phase and increases as time goes on so<br>we like to do PCR on acute samples that<br>are four to seven days post onset and<br>after a week of symptoms we do serology<br>and sometimes urine for PCR but since<br>the patient seemed to shed<br>intermittently we don't like to do your<br>in PCR single a by itself but in<br>association with serology and we found<br>that CSF is a very good specimen for PCR<br>as long as the patient is symptomatic so<br>interpretation of lab tests a positive<br>rapid test or screening test is<br>considered presumptive so it needs<br>confirmation and the mat is the<br>confirmatory test and a four-fold rise<br>is considered diagnostic however there<br>are problems with interpretation of this<br>test often we rarely rarely get paired<br>samples that are drawn at the correct<br>times in the illness so we're often<br>interpreting titers in a single specimen<br>and if the titers are low or even if<br>their titers are low in paired specimens<br>and they don't show a rise and tighter<br>it's difficult to interpret<br>especially in endemic areas IgG remains<br>in the detectable in patients who have<br>had a previous illness or exposure so we<br>can't distinguish between current<br>illness and<br>exposure using serology we also have<br>patients who never Ciro convert the 14<br>year old boy who got lepto from caring<br>for his dog was diagnosed with lepto<br>using PCR but he never seer converted<br>even though the dog showed a very strong<br>serological response also if an and a<br>course of antibiotics has started very<br>early it can really fort the antibiotic<br>response so depending on when treatment<br>was started it could affect the<br>patient's titer also our antigen panel<br>is limited usually patients cross-react<br>with a number of different antigens but<br>there's certainly the possibility that<br>we could be missing something from our<br>panel it suggested that you use an<br>antigen panel that's representative of<br>isolates that are known to occur in your<br>region but we get a lot of people who<br>travel to different countries and<br>contract leptospirosis so it's hard to<br>have a ubiquitous antigen panel that<br>will cover everything and as I mentioned<br>before PCR a positive is confirmatory<br>but a negative won't rule it out so the<br>best practice is to run multiple tests<br>on multiple specimens and that will<br>result in the most accurate diagnosis of<br>lepto but it's usually not possible and<br>in a lab setting or clinical setting so<br>just to summarize the clinical<br>presentation is extremely varied and I<br>think the physician awareness that a<br>bacterial illness could occur in an<br>outbreak of dengue for example or<br>instead of a viral illness and that it<br>has multiple different presentations is<br>extremely important just to be aware and<br>that our testing is imperfect and to<br>interpret those tests knowing that while<br>using multiple sources including the<br>clinical presentation the lab values and<br>making sure patient history is taken so<br>that risk factors can be analyzed and<br>and aiding in the diagnosis so that's<br>all I have I don't know if anyone has<br>any questions I'm happy to answer all<br>right I'm gonna just sit up this<br>microphone we can we can throw you a<br>microphone<br>okay yeah so it's it's thought that once<br>you've had leptospirosis that you're<br>immune but as I mentioned there are more<br>than 250 seer of ours so it often<br>doesn't cross protect so you could be<br>you could get any other C revoir<br>infected with any other serovars so just<br>because you've had it doesn't mean<br>you're immune to other serum ours yes<br>you can be yes mmm I'm not a vet<br>but I believe the vaccine is quite<br>effective but I think it has to be at<br>least in dogs it's recommended annually<br>and it's not always given annually for<br>cattle I think they vaccinate the herd<br>and it does a good job but I think then<br>sometimes they get complacent<br>because they haven't had any cases so as<br>long as they continue with the<br>recommended vaccination schedule I think<br>quite effective but again those the<br>veterinary vaccines are also limited in<br>their cereal bars but cattle only carry<br>are known to carry a certain<br>certain number of serovars and dogs so<br>the vaccines represent the most common<br>ones in dogs or cattle you can if you're<br>urinating in the water yes yes even we<br>we've actually even detected or isolated<br>live organism from the urine of a<br>patient who have fully recovered<br>following antibiotic treatment so<br>there's a little window of time where<br>patients are known to shut it in their<br>urine but there's very very very little<br>human to human transmission usually it's<br>dealing with animals so we don't know<br>it's the same serovars cause that<br>syndrome as well as the classical kidney<br>liver failure syndrome which are<br>completely different so it's probably<br>hypothesized that it's a number of<br>different factors whether it's bacterial<br>virulence factors or host factors but<br>it's also probably related to the<br>infectious dose that's inhaled in the<br>lungs yes so different geographies see<br>different species so there have been<br>some species that are only found in the<br>US but they're much less pathogenic the<br>in tarragon's the species I mentioned is<br>found worldwide on every continent and<br>is the most common but there are certain<br>lip you know species that are only found<br>in certain areas but the bad one the<br>well what questions we'll just think<br>we're now again and then I'll go to the<br>quiz cuz I know you're waiting for that<br>any thoughts on these prominent former<br>University of Otago medical school<br>leptospirosis researchers I'll say that<br>there were some very subtle clues and<br>Rene's talk but you'd have to be quite<br>subtle indeed any takers no not Peter<br>snow not thanks for having a stab go<br>anyone else like I know you know then<br>has the I have a slide with the answers<br>yeah I can yeah let me just yeah they<br>both have a lip despise species named<br>after them if that helps Oh since Mike<br>suggests at all let's go back there are<br>quite a few lipped aspire species so I<br>don't know how much of a clue this is it<br>might just trigger some memories it's<br>not the one with the red box around it<br>it's looking like ranae might be getting<br>a bottle of fermented grape juice I<br>Bryn's looking looking like he might be<br>really do you're gonna stay out of it<br>okay here enough okay all right so the<br>gentleman on the left is Leopold<br>Kirchner he was born in the<br>austrian-hungarian empire and fled there<br>with the Germans to the Netherlands<br>where he trained at the Dutch tropical<br>Institute and then moved to Indonesia<br>where he became the deputy director of<br>the Pasteur Institute in Bandung and<br>Java and was R was preceded to be<br>interned by the Japanese there he<br>survived that experience in was<br>recruited to university of otago by Sir<br>Charles Lucas right after the Second<br>World War where he lived the<br>microbiology research laboratory and the<br>hircus building on the third floor is<br>it's no longer a laboratory but you can<br>go and see it<br>he came when he came to New Zealand<br>after the Second World War in New<br>Zealand was thought to be free of<br>Linda's process and he thought this<br>can't be and said about doing a series<br>of studies that culminated in<br>confirmation of the first human case in<br>Auckland in 1949 and then it was also<br>involved in confirming the first<br>livestock outbreak that occurred in<br>Westland near hokitika on a dairy farm<br>in 1951 and the vet incidentally who<br>worked on that outbreak is still alive<br>living in Palmerston North and we had<br>the pleasure of meeting him last week<br>mr. Neil Korea he's 91 so Leptospira<br>Kirchner is named for the opposed<br>Kirchner as one of the pathogen eclipta<br>spires on the list and then emeritus<br>professor solomon Fane did his medical<br>degree here and then as MD in 1958 under<br>Kirchner and Salomon Fane is still alive<br>he's also 91 living in<br>not in Melbourne and he has an<br>intermediate lipped aspire named after<br>him that dispara nei so just to say that<br>there is a tradition of lik dis versus<br>research here now you have to go back<br>away but I hope that was of interest and<br>I'm sorry that no one got the wine but<br>Rene I'll be able to take it back to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
