David<br>fielding I'm one of the organizers of<br>the 2017 Global Health Conference and it<br>gives me great pleasure to introduce the<br>final event of our conference which is<br>the 2017 Macaulay duration by Professor<br>mark MacGillivray so Mark's told me that<br>his talk is going to last about 40 or 45<br>minutes and then we'll be time for<br>questions but I assure people from the<br>infectious disease conference that we<br>will finish on time so don't worry so<br>I'm just gonna say a few words about<br>Professor MacGillivray whom I've known<br>for the last 20 years or so his her<br>hasn't changed color quite as much as<br>mine house in the last 20 years<br>mark is from a small town called choroid<br>in rural Victoria he is the son of dairy<br>farmers so he feels really at home here<br>but he left home at a young age<br>and went to Melbourne where he studied<br>at Latrobe University and graduated from<br>Latrobe with a PhD in economics he has<br>been an academic mainly at RMIT and<br>Deakin University in Melbourne but he<br>has also spent a large amount of time as<br>a policy maker firstly as the Deputy<br>Director of the world Institute for<br>development economics research in<br>Helsinki which is a United Nations<br>institution and then secondly for<br>several years as chief economist of<br>AusAID which is the Australian<br>international was the Australian<br>International Development Ministry the<br>equivalent of Enzo died he has published<br>very very many publications on<br>international developments<br>foreign aid and it's measurement very<br>highly cited author within academia but<br>also a very respected policymaker who<br>has worked with more governments than I<br>can remember and international<br>institutions so he's been very<br>influential the last couple of decades<br>in the policymaking community as well as<br>academia and the the topic of his talk<br>tonight<br>is very much part of his research agenda<br>over the last couple of decades very<br>much what he's about so it's great to<br>have him here so I hope you'll welcome<br>him warmly let me thank professor<br>fielding for that very nice introduction<br>on the gray here you might notice that<br>my hair is quite short at the side it's<br>tense it might cut out I'm delighted to<br>be at this conference I'm delighted to<br>be here and Dunedin not only do I come<br>from dairy farming stock but with the<br>surname like MacGillivray you might<br>understand I'm also from Scottish stock<br>so coming to Dunedin Intuit Argo is is<br>an added delight for that reason I've<br>been very lucky I've been here for two<br>weeks I've spent the last two days<br>sitting through a wonderful conference<br>with very high quality and very<br>interesting presentations I was<br>fortunate enough to present an award to<br>some local skilled children for some<br>artwork they prepared for the conference<br>I haven't done a lot of that over the<br>years that I must say it was a<br>delightful a delightful experience I've<br>also been lucky enough to spend two<br>weeks in the Department of Economics at<br>Otago with David and his colleagues and<br>that's been a very very pleasant<br>experience David and I have known each<br>other for quite some time as he said<br>I'll I'll add to that a bit we were both<br>at the University of Nottingham<br>in the United Kingdom in - in 1994<br>that's when we met in January 1994 David<br>had not long come from a position at the<br>University of Oxford - a position at the<br>University of Nottingham I'd come from<br>from from Melbourne to Nottingham to<br>take up a research fellowship there and<br>we've worked with each other or we kept<br>in contact for those more than 20 years<br>David has helped me many many times in<br>the various capacities I've had I hope<br>that I can reciprocate in what I'm about<br>to do tonight and to help you to help<br>him out now the title of the operation<br>is as you can see which developing<br>countries are better at converting<br>economic growth into better health and<br>why okay now I am an economist I am an<br>empirical economist so I do tend to like<br>to present in numbers and graphs so for<br>the non empiricists in the audience I<br>but I just do need to forewarn you of<br>that but I'll try and do it in a way<br>that's not at least totally boring but<br>that is that that is a warning okay okay<br>just let me give a bit of an outline of<br>tonight's lecture I Michigan it presents<br>some work in progress a research project<br>and which I've involved it's in the<br>fairly early stages of that project that<br>research but nonetheless I'll give you<br>some of the preliminary results that<br>come out of it but I want to put the<br>research project in context and the<br>context is I guess a comment that I have<br>on much of the research that empirical<br>economists like myself do on links<br>between economic growth and health so I<br>will do that<br>or then provide an outline of the<br>research design of the project which has<br>the same title as as tonight's lecture<br>and what I then do is I will identify<br>countries that punch above their weight<br>in health chain and what I mean by that<br>is countries that have higher levels of<br>health achievement than we expect given<br>their wealth given their ink<br>per capita okay so I know that the focus<br>is not on countries so much that have<br>high levels of health achievement that's<br>on health achievement and relative to<br>what we'd expect given their incomes per<br>capita okay so that's a distinction I<br>want to make I'll make it a few more<br>times as the lecture progresses um but<br>there's an obvious question here if you<br>know why do why do this sort of research<br>and essentially I mean like my concern<br>is to inform policy choices aimed at<br>better health promotion but in<br>particular to identify lessons that can<br>be transferred to other countries that<br>can be transferred from the countries<br>that punch above their weight to<br>countries that do not okay let me start<br>with a comment on economic growth and<br>health and the research that focuses on<br>that by people such as myself<br>um here I'm referring to cross country<br>research okay comparing different<br>experiences of countries using cross<br>country or international data what<br>there's a large and growing empirical<br>literature that lots of links between<br>economic growth or more generally<br>achievement incomes and health in<br>developing countries the literature<br>tests for a two-way of a bidirectional<br>or dodging us link between economic<br>growth and health that overall concern<br>is where the better health contributes<br>to higher economic growth and with a<br>higher during growth also contributes to<br>better health<br>it's the two-way relationship to which I<br>refer to um yeah I have I have no<br>problems with that research has led to<br>many very important and very relevant<br>policy relevant findings um that the<br>focus though is primarily on economic<br>growth so we're concerned with whether<br>better health translates into better<br>economic growth<br>okay the often the concern is not so<br>much on me in the other direction in<br>other words we're concerned with the<br>endogenous relationship so we can better<br>on<br>stand and better quantify or provide the<br>empirics of what drives economic growth<br>in developing countries but developed<br>countries as well um the but this is<br>based on an implicit assumption that can<br>I make growth is is a worthy end in its<br>own right it's based on the implicit<br>assumption that economic growth is a<br>worthy end or objective or achievement<br>in its own right I'd make another<br>comment to is that what we often do in<br>in academia is that we tend to stay in<br>in comfort zones right we tend to stay<br>in areas that we already know quite a<br>lot about and what we do is we strive<br>for small incremental steps or advances<br>in those areas now there's nothing<br>inherently wrong with that but I think<br>what we should be doing is not sort of<br>focusing on what we know or largely<br>though but try to identify what we don't<br>know and then basing our research around<br>it so let me just elaborate on on this a<br>little actually I've gotten ahead of<br>myself but two comments right researcher<br>that's already made should commence by<br>establishing what it is we do not know<br>and framing further inquiry around that<br>and we need to be very clear about the<br>importance or how to conceptualize<br>economic growth okay so just to repeat<br>we should start out by framing our<br>essential questions around what we don't<br>know and if we are looking at economic<br>growth then we need a very clear and<br>grounded explicit conceptualization of<br>economic growth itself<br>oh no I will expand upon these two kinds<br>into it okay so what we do know and what<br>we don't know now I there's probably<br>some empirical research is that that<br>will validly and more rightly take take<br>take me to task on some of these points<br>but nonetheless I've repeated<br>oh look higher incomes do as a general<br>rule lead to better health there's a<br>number of channels to which that occurs<br>higher private and public incomes can<br>support increased expenditure on the<br>provision of health services I know also<br>that the productivity of that<br>expenditure is also very important<br>higher incomes can also contribute to<br>known drivers of health such as<br>education levels and the provision of<br>water and sanitation services which<br>measure in in developing countries now I<br>know there are many other channels and<br>there are many other aspects of the<br>linkage here I'm just singling out some<br>examples so what I would say is let's<br>just just accept that right let's accept<br>there's a relationship there let's<br>accept accept that accept that higher<br>rates of economic growth and higher<br>levels of per capita income matter for<br>health achievement what we do not know<br>or know lesson now is why some<br>developing countries have higher health<br>achievements that would be expected<br>given their income levels and vice-versa<br>to me that is an unanswered question to<br>me that is what we don't know enough<br>about and I want to frame my research<br>around that question I would add that<br>this is presumably a story about one way<br>growth is more Pro health in some<br>countries than others and to all non<br>income drivers of health achievement in<br>these countries I mean we should you<br>know we should be important I mean we<br>need to acknowledge that there are many<br>many other drivers of which health is<br>merely one which they can regrow this is<br>merely one now something a little more<br>fundamental now those of you that were<br>at the the two-day conference to which<br>day that am I referred will have had the<br>the pleasure the great pleasure of of<br>receiving a presentation from associate<br>professor Stephen laws he was looking at<br>the now he's he was looking at me<br>quizzically there I can see him in the<br>audience and now he's smiling<br>but anyway<br>and I do not exaggerate that he focused<br>on the sustainable development goals a<br>new initiative coming from the UN and<br>applicable to all all countries those of<br>you that know they replace the<br>Millennium Development Goals and Stephen<br>made it some quite similar points to<br>what I'm about to make<br>I run a slightly different way I rely<br>here on the philosophic philosophical<br>literature regarding instrumental versus<br>intrinsic properties of various outcomes<br>okay but what I'm about to say is<br>reinforcing of what what Stephen said<br>two days ago I might add that we did not<br>collaborate at all we I saw his<br>presentation the first time of the<br>morning of the conference and he's<br>seeing my presentation the first time<br>now so this was quite quite coincidental<br>but I think they're at the point of<br>making here that I was that among<br>economists such as Stephen I and also<br>David fielding that focus on developing<br>countries we are much more attuned to<br>the fact that there are some huge huge<br>challenges and among them include<br>achieving higher rates or higher there<br>was a bit of Health and to that extent<br>we see economic growth is within that<br>context let me just explain a bit more<br>economic growth my definition is the<br>expansion of per capita income levels or<br>Everage income levels in countries all<br>the expansion of wealth<br>I know wealth can also take into account<br>assets but but I think it's as a<br>approximation I can refer some income as<br>wealth the central point though is that<br>income has no intrinsic value it has no<br>intrinsic value or luteal intrinsic<br>value a fistful of dollars in itself<br>does nothing for you it's what you can<br>do with the fistful of dollars that is<br>important okay that's a fundamental<br>distinction you might argue that having<br>a fistful of dollars or having high<br>income might be important because it<br>gives you a sense of it<br>security I mean I'll concede that right<br>but I think other than that income has<br>no intrinsic value<br>its purpose is largely instrumental okay<br>and here and I lost some formatting in<br>there in the in the quotes but people<br>like myself trot this quote out all the<br>time but it has residents and I see no<br>reason why I shouldn't continue to use<br>it in in events like this but also in<br>papers and Aristotle Center wealth is<br>evidently not the God we are seeking for<br>it is merely useful for the sake of<br>something else ok so that my take on<br>arrest of at other people's take on<br>Aristotle's comment is that income has<br>little if any intrinsic value its use<br>here support its purpose or value is<br>largely an instrumental now something<br>else and here I run a line that has been<br>presented in work within the United<br>Nations many of you will be aware of the<br>United Nations Development Program and<br>the Human Development Report that<br>publishes everything and it's around the<br>human aspects of developed so that<br>something else is the opportunity of<br>people to realize their potential as<br>human beings<br>this requires many things but it<br>certainly requires better health which<br>is both of intrinsic and instrumental<br>value ok to mean this is the<br>justification for the research that I'm<br>undertaking and it provides a conceptual<br>context for what's what's about to<br>follow but back to completing by to<br>comments on literature again the<br>literature on economic growth and health<br>for human capital has produced many many<br>important insights but given the the<br>very nature of growth let's focus more<br>on what<br>growth drives and relatively less on<br>what drives growth okay in a developing<br>country context I think that is a<br>fundamental cause that the risk of<br>overstating it let's focus more on<br>growth drives and relatively less on<br>what drives growth now that's that's the<br>that's the background okay that's the<br>context right now let me talk about the<br>research project it asks which<br>developing countries punch above their<br>weight with respect to health achieved<br>I've already defined punching above<br>their weight but there are two aspects<br>to that to reiterate the first is which<br>countries are better at converting<br>economic growth into better health the<br>second aspect is which countries have<br>higher levels of health than predicted<br>by their incomes of their capital so if<br>you're like incomes per capita income or<br>wealth lose the weight okay<br>the punch is the achievement in health<br>now I apply mixed methods in my research<br>now for me that's quite it Davis looking<br>at me in a quizzical way now David knows<br>that night my training is essentially as<br>reasonable amount of time you know 20<br>years two years of Rose running<br>regressions basically so doing upon<br>American Alice's tried to fit data to or<br>fit good data together nothing wrong<br>with that but I think that that research<br>is part of the of our story if we really<br>want to really dig deeply to get<br>insights that we can't get from robust<br>and and scientific analysis of data we<br>do need to use mixed methods research<br>and we do need to back up our Pyrrhic or<br>research with such things as what was<br>qualitative research key informant<br>interviews<br>focus groups that sort of thing okay um<br>now I I'm still learning okay I<br>forgotten a lot about econometrics but I<br>for this research but something that<br>David mentioned I've spent a bit of time<br>both in academia and outside of academia<br>you know I think now I think I'm talking<br>to the economists here more than more<br>than the others so think people outside<br>of economics will accept the points I'm<br>making that that you know really if you<br>want to convince policymakers to change<br>actions or to or to help them design<br>programs you know to take your advice to<br>present a Prada metric resource in<br>itself doesn't change much right you<br>could say there's little intrinsic value<br>so okay you really do need to dig deep<br>dig more deeply and and validate your<br>findings from empirical research with<br>the qualitative research or at least<br>conduct those two methods of research in<br>in mutually complementary ways so that's<br>what we're about<br>so what we do is we we use empirical<br>analysis to select country case studies<br>okay so we use the statistics to<br>identify those countries that seem to<br>seem to punch most above their weight<br>and then to dig down more deeply to<br>understand that we use a mix of<br>empirical research so further<br>econometrics testing but key informant<br>interviews focus groups and other means<br>and qualitative investigation um now I I<br>did warn you<br>you know I am an empiricist I I can't<br>help but you know give some statistics<br>and and talk a bit about that so what<br>you're seeing tonight primarily<br>interested me the the lecture is more<br>about the the empirics with a little bit<br>at the end of some qualitative research<br>so what we're about to bark upon now is<br>an answer to the question which<br>countries have higher levels of health<br>than predicted by their incomes per<br>capita<br>and I also as an empirical researcher<br>and for the non empiricist you have to<br>indulge me here for a few minutes okay I<br>feel so they have to say something about<br>something about data basically what I do<br>is I for the purpose of tonight's<br>presentation in the project we look at<br>many many more other indicators of<br>health and probably more incisive ones<br>and then the first one I'm looking at<br>okay but the two indicators are look<br>outside and life expectancy at birth in<br>years I take an average of the period<br>1990 to 2015 I mean III know you know<br>one of the principal criticisms of life<br>expectancy says nothing about the<br>quality of life years I accept that and<br>that will be addressed in further work<br>I'm much happier with using the child<br>mortality rate so the number of children<br>not reaching their fifth birthday per<br>1000 live births and I used the average<br>to period 1990 to 2015 about income per<br>capita as a standard measure I use gross<br>national income per capita adjusted for<br>purchasing power parity the sample of<br>countries that I look at are 138<br>developing countries now I want to have<br>a race of a large sample of countries so<br>I there are many countries it's some<br>people think I'll make shouldn't because<br>it I'm developing but I basically take<br>the UMD teams very high human<br>development category for those of you<br>that know about this you know the UNDP<br>publishes the Human Development Index<br>which combines income and education and<br>health into a single number and it uses<br>the levels of that index to to find<br>countries a very high human development<br>category country is one with the Human<br>Development Index at 0.8 or higher the<br>index varies theoretically between 0 and<br>100 now what that does is both being<br>for which data are available that<br>excludes 41 countries okay so I've taken<br>41 countries out of the sample<br>considering them to be developed<br>developed and the rest developing and<br>old are taken from the Human Development<br>Report database now okay so here I I<br>might need a little more indulgence okay<br>the question here is how is punching<br>above weight detected so what I have is<br>I have income GNI per capita on the<br>horizontal axis and higher life<br>expectancy on the vertical axis each of<br>those dots represents a combination it<br>represents that represents a country<br>so the 138 dots there okay and they show<br>combinations of they show each country's<br>G&amp;I per capita its income child it<br>against its life expectancy so the<br>countries up the top right hand corner<br>those dots each dots of country okay<br>have high incomes per capita and high<br>life expectancies those down the bottom<br>other of this low incomes per capita and<br>low life expectancies<br>okay so that's where I start what I do<br>is I compare a cross country experience<br>or profile of income per capita charted<br>against life expectancy for H of the 138<br>countries okay that's the first<br>arrangement then what I do is I use a<br>simple empirical technique the curve<br>fitting technique is I fit a line of<br>best fit okay to the data now this line<br>of best fit and in a certain month<br>technical way basically captures best<br>the relationship across the countries<br>between income per capita and life<br>expectancy<br>right so as you'll see okay we've got as<br>income per capita increases across<br>countries so tutors does life expectancy<br>so countries higher per capita incomes<br>have higher life expectancies and<br>vice-versa<br>okay that's the next step so it sort of<br>confirms that there's a simple<br>relationship between income per capita<br>and life expectancy right but the key<br>point though is you'll note that again<br>we're calling at each of those dots is a<br>country okay but some countries lie<br>above the line and some countries live<br>below the line now the line is actually<br>what is it's the prediction it<br>represents based on this cross country<br>experience the level of life expectancy<br>that will be predicted by income per<br>capita right now the fact that you have<br>some countries above the line says that<br>they have higher income per capita x' oh<br>sorry higher life expectancies than<br>predicted by income per capita and you<br>have countries below the line have lower<br>life expectancies than predicted by the<br>incomes per capita so the countries<br>above that line punch above their weight<br>the countries below that line punch<br>above their weight emphasizing the line<br>is actually the prediction that line is<br>the predicted level of life expectancy<br>based on a simple relationship with<br>income per capita measured by by G and I<br>now someone would be saying what about<br>other drivers of life expectancy it fine<br>but I'll get to them<br>okay now<br>so what I'd like you to imagine them is<br>if you can imagine the vertical distance<br>between each X dot and that line that<br>vertical distance in other words the<br>extent to which a country lies below the<br>line and the extent to which a country<br>lies above the line is my measure of<br>under and over achievement for the<br>statisticians in the audience what I'm<br>doing is I'm running a simple less<br>squares regression and I'm taking the<br>error terms those it returns the<br>vertical distance between the line of<br>best fit please in each point that's my<br>measure of under or over achieved okay<br>I've sort of said all that haven't I<br>okay I tend to do that sometimes in<br>presentations I get a little bit ahead<br>of myself but but anyway so what what is<br>on the screen is what pretty much just<br>what I just said okay don't now but I<br>want to focus on the the last few points<br>in this screen okay while some countries<br>be above the line well let me do to the<br>nature of economic growth recognizing<br>the economic growth as a growth of<br>Beveridge incomes incomes per capita<br>something lie about the line because of<br>the nature of growth in those countries<br>the nature of growth will be inherently<br>ProHealth provision and it can mean many<br>many reasons to that I'm referring back<br>to my comments on on bhajan IOT and I'll<br>say this quickly for the the the<br>econometricians in the audience could<br>simply reflect strong feedback loops<br>between economic growth and health in a<br>way though that sees a given increase in<br>health leading to a bigger if they see<br>increasing growth in to a big increase<br>in health but it can also be due to<br>other drivers of health achievement I<br>mean if we go back to the hope this will<br>work you know the position of those dots<br>you know the position of each country<br>wide only reflects the extent to which<br>economic growth translates in a bit of<br>health it will also reflect other<br>drivers of<br>life expectancy in this case other than<br>other than economic growth itself yeah<br>just come back to this this is the graph<br>I just showed you a moment ago I just<br>want to highlight one point here this is<br>a R is a it's correlation coefficient<br>basically it says 72 percent of the<br>variation in life expectancy is<br>predicted by the logger<br>I'd income per capita okay so yeah what<br>I've got is I have the top 20 achievers<br>so these are the countries and then for<br>each of those dots before it's a country<br>okay so I've just taken out those that<br>lie furthest above the line of best fit<br>they're my high achievers okay I'll just<br>let you just absorb this for a moment<br>but okay years here it's not the years<br>of life expectancy as you can probably<br>imagine it's the it's over achieved<br>okay so Cuba what this is is that based<br>on its income per capita average incomes<br>in in Cuba and also take into account<br>the cross country relationship between<br>between income per capita and life<br>expectancy Cubans live 12.2 years longer<br>than we'd expect given their income per<br>capita now this is an average figure<br>that they have lived an average of 12.2<br>years longer<br>over the period 1990 to 2015<br>okay Vietnam comes in second Vietnamese<br>have lived almost 12 years longer than<br>we'd expect based on their income per<br>capita we have some countries from from<br>Solomon Islands and Tonga I just ask you<br>to to remember that because I want to<br>come I want to come back to want to come<br>back to this you might be looking at the<br>Syria Syrian Arab Republic Syria my<br>daughter stopped in 2015 okay<br>and we'll know what's happening in Syria<br>at the moment so I'm not I'm not<br>capturing also to remember I'm taking an<br>average over over 16 years as well<br>okay so Vietnam China quite a mix of<br>countries Cuba is one that is it's not a<br>surprise there's been similar research<br>that has been done looking at<br>multi-dimensional well-being<br>achievements taking account of range of<br>indicators Cuba does well in<br>multi-dimensional well-being achievement<br>relative to its income per capita now we<br>go to the other end of the scale these<br>are the the lower chambers that have<br>lower levels of life expectancy than<br>predicted by their incomes per capita so<br>at the very bottom we see Angola and<br>Equatorial Guinea so based on its income<br>per capita we would expect people in<br>Equatorial Guinea<br>to have lived 20 years longer that may<br>have on average between 1990 and 2015<br>okay Angola 17.4 what is it about those<br>listed countries<br>well the first thing that you notice is<br>that yes it is all of them are all from<br>sub-saharan Africa okay now you might<br>say ok well sub-saharan African<br>countries have low levels of income per<br>capita they're poor okay<br>but that's what this is saying is that<br>even by the levels of the income per<br>capita they have much lower health than<br>life expectancies and we'd predict so<br>this list is just not a story it's not a<br>story about low incomes<br>it's a story about the conversion of<br>those incomes into life expectancy and<br>other drivers of life expectancy other<br>than income per capita let me now turn<br>to child mortality I did the same<br>exercise for child mortality now this<br>time the line goes down okay so higher<br>incomes are associated with lower child<br>mortality lower incomes associated with<br>higher child fertility yeah that dot<br>right off the top game for upsets of<br>country any guesses I'll keep you in<br>suspense<br>okay so above the line this time is bad<br>okay above the line is bad so it's<br>higher<br>child mortality than predicted by income<br>per capita so countries want to be below<br>the line okay okay so here we go so<br>we're going to go with the the high<br>achievers those below the line with<br>lower child mortality rates than we'd<br>expect given their incomes per capita<br>yeah what do you see we see 20 countries<br>okay Solomon Islands so based on average<br>data between 1990 and 2015<br>Dec here sixty-six fewer children have<br>died before their first their fifth<br>birthday in in Solomon Islands they<br>would expect given its income per capita<br>sixty-six fewer children have died<br>before their fifth birthday fewer<br>children have died before their fifth<br>birthday in Solomon Islands that won't<br>be predicted based upon their income<br>currently its income per capita<br>Vanuatu it was back report was in the<br>previous list Vietnam still made<br>Syria was again in the list good again<br>they make the previous coming we're up<br>to 2014 and more well it's the previous<br>this was reasonably diverse but none of<br>this is China is also back now we go to<br>the lower chambers now remember I asked<br>you which was the country right top okay<br>we're ready hard to say yeah this is not<br>a good news story clearly okay it's of<br>interest that you know which of the two<br>countries the bottom of us before<br>Equatorial Guinea and Angola<br>okay now associate professor Knowles<br>made a comment about these two countries<br>in his presentation two days ago<br>he observed that they were natural<br>resource rich countries okay<br>Equatorial Guinea in particular said<br>over recent uses spectacular increase in<br>its income<br>owing to oil wealth if my memory is<br>correct that the nature of social<br>structures in Equatorial Guinea is that<br>that oil wealth is concentrated in<br>relatively few hands and it's been<br>virtually no or negligible improvement<br>in other conditions so you know okay I<br>use a term ELISA there's been no sort of<br>trickle-down you know that wolf hasn't<br>been dispersed across the across the<br>population base so basically if you if<br>you if you ignored Equatorial Guinea is<br>income per capita I don't remember these<br>bits around $20,000 okay so and this is<br>purchasing power parity adjustment so it<br>sort of puts it up with you know what<br>developed countries it's to ignore its<br>income per capita and just look at its<br>health education education indicators<br>it's a very poor country so what's<br>happened is that the health hasn't been<br>the conversion of that increased wealth<br>into more broad-based living<br>it's a similar story about Angola we<br>also look though you look at the<br>countries on the list sub-saharan Africa<br>again dominates but of those countries<br>we have many that are rich in natural<br>resources Angola<br>Equatorial Guinea Sierra Leone to a<br>certain extent with with its diamond<br>wealth South Sudan Nigeria Oman appears<br>there the oil-rich Middle Eastern<br>country Czech Republic is an interesting<br>one I I haven't got an interpretation of<br>that I want to have a little bit more<br>closely at the numbers ok that could be<br>a statistical anomaly but nonetheless<br>though it's interesting interesting<br>picture but of course you might have<br>noticed you want have noticed it yeah<br>okay um I made a mistake in my empirical<br>work what I did was I started out with a<br>cat with a list of just developed<br>countries and I thought I took out all<br>of sorry a list of developed and<br>developing countries so a list of the<br>world basically which tire who were<br>available I went through and I thought I<br>took out all of the developed countries<br>that I had as it turned out and I only<br>noticed a few days ago when I was<br>preparing this lecture I inadvertently<br>left the United States in in the sample<br>now this is not I'm not trying to you<br>know to bash the u.s. in any way but it<br>turns out though that the US is if we<br>just said it's a developing and<br>developed developing country we just<br>keep it in the list the US is actually<br>in the lowest achievers so basically<br>based on the USS average income what<br>income per capita from 1990 to 2015 we<br>thirty more children to have lived until<br>their fifth birthdays so I think that's<br>a that's an interesting finding um I<br>sort of do know where I am I am in New<br>Zealand if I was to put New Zealand into<br>the sample it could be in the higher<br>achievers I don't know<br>similar paper based on its a<br>multi-dimensional well-being paper and<br>it's I take the Human Development Index<br>so a combination of income health and<br>education and I didn't say an exercise<br>for it New Zealand based on 2015 data<br>ranks number six six in the world so in<br>the conversion of income per capita into<br>a multi-dimensional well-being but I<br>mentioned that in passing but I thought<br>I just present this result for the u.s.<br>it is an interesting one many<br>interpretations of this all I would say<br>is that there's a huge amount of<br>diversity within the US as we know so<br>don't know how I'm going for time but ok<br>now what I do okay now what I do is I<br>say we take those countries that are in<br>both lists all right now obviously I'm<br>going to when with the project which are<br>affair I'm getting a lot more of this<br>work but just based on life expectancy<br>and child mortality which countries are<br>in both lists both those punching well<br>above their weight and this is the list<br>Solomon Islands to name a few Vietnam<br>Tana Vanuatu from the region so the ones<br>I I would emphasize here at Solomon<br>Islands Vietnam hunger and and Vanuatu I<br>and here I'm about to building further<br>that I am speculating here I'll come<br>back to the screen but what is it about<br>those countries that places them in the<br>highest achieving category for both<br>indicators of health has economic growth<br>in being pro health achievement I'll<br>explain that I mean by that in a moment<br>have factors other than income per<br>capita drip in their health achievements<br>or is it a combination of both of these<br>factors yeah this is the question that<br>our project will look at in more detail<br>I hope to come back to another Health<br>Conference here David to present the<br>findings ok hopefully next year that who<br>knows ya know<br>so with this framing questions in mind<br>let's just go back to the to the list ok<br>so what now I haven't got the answers I<br>mean I've just got the questions at the<br>moment ok that is it primarily the<br>nature of economic growth higher income<br>achievement that deems these countries<br>high achievers<br>what is it factors other than economic<br>growth they have driven this achievement<br>or a combination of the both now I'll<br>comment on me I've spent a lot of time<br>in Vietnam I've spent a lot of time in<br>in Vanuatu doing various evaluations and<br>I've made a couple of trips in my<br>capacity with oz aid to the Solomon<br>Islands so I am across some qualitative<br>research on conditions in those<br>countries but I I am emphasizing I'm<br>just thinking aloud now ok I haven't got<br>any definitive answers I just got some<br>thoughts what I would say about Vietnam<br>is that Vietnam has a tremendous<br>achievement of pro-poor economic growth<br>if we look at most of the countries in<br>the world you look at East Asia we tend<br>to talk about the tremendous<br>achievements of China that it is you<br>know pork more people above the income<br>poverty line than any other country if<br>you look more closely though<br>Vietnam is record is more impressive it<br>has employs many people out of poverty<br>is China<br>there's Porter a greater proportion of<br>US population out of poverty than China<br>has and much of that has been about you<br>know putting last first it's been a<br>focus around the rural poor aimed at<br>improving<br>reduction providing reforms to markets<br>but it has had quite Vietnam has had<br>quite a pro poor orientation to its<br>growth<br>okay now we're talking income poverty<br>but I think as a stylized fact we would<br>expect poor families those living in<br>poverty to to experience higher rates of<br>child mortality so my interpretation of<br>the alarms experiences that's focus on<br>on on the very poor you know putting the<br>last first and seeking to improve income<br>levels has flowed through into inter<br>improvements in health so in Viet Nam's<br>case I'll argue that I will assert<br>Hamas's it is largely a story of the<br>nature of growth in Vietnam which has<br>being pro health promotion in its<br>orientation but but I'll stand corrected<br>then are to an Solomon Islands two<br>characteristics that or the<br>characteristic that both countries share<br>is what there's a there's a very high<br>proportion of the populations in both<br>countries living in the informal sector<br>and and with access to land and access<br>to relatively fertile land that provides<br>a basis for food production okay so now<br>I don't cause I know that you know food<br>per se it's not guaranteed better health<br>but I will search that it's this is this<br>is worth looking into a little more<br>I was suggested communal land access has<br>been important in driving the over<br>achievement of both of course are very<br>poor countries and remain remain so in<br>the bottom quartile of countries<br>worldwide in terms of per capita income<br>levels but they do certainly punch above<br>their weight and I'm suggesting one of<br>those factors is access to access to<br>first are late<br>now Tommy I cannot talk so much about<br>that that is my initial interpretation<br>that again what we need to do in our<br>project is to actually dig much deeper<br>into these countries with the sort of<br>qualitative research to which I referred<br>before okay<br>Solomon Islands like Vanuatu very high<br>water people have access to land they<br>have access to to fertile land and my my<br>contention of my assertion is that that<br>has been an important factor in driving<br>over achievement in health in those two<br>countries so I think I'll conclude with<br>a stay tuned and I will thank you very<br>much for your attention<br>so we do have a few minutes for<br>questions Jackie do you have the<br>microphone<br>unfortunately we apologize we just had<br>the one microphone so Jackie's going to<br>have to sprint up and down but we have<br>one question at the front here thank you<br>very much for interesting talk if you<br>wait at each of those points by the Gini<br>coefficient for each country what would<br>what would happen to the outcome okay<br>that's a very good point<br>in trying to get a little closer so that<br>the question about you know over<br>achievement in terms of economic growth<br>we need to control for other factors<br>that's what we're doing at the moment my<br>prior is the the Gini coefficient or<br>some other noting there are many<br>measures of of income inequality but the<br>question is does income inequality or<br>income equality matter<br>hence the reference of Gini coefficient<br>I would say almost certainly so Vietnam<br>has relatively low income inequality it<br>has risen a good in recent years we've<br>lacked data for the Solomon Islands and<br>Vanuatu but the the impression is that<br>in both income inequality levels are<br>quite low but that is certainly one of<br>the control variables that we're using<br>in looking at factors other than<br>economic growth that have contributed to<br>over achievement and underachieving<br>you know if you take what I said about<br>Equatorial Guinea I was basically saying<br>it is society inequality that has meant<br>that Equatorial Guinea is not being able<br>to translate its spectacularly high-risk<br>income achievement into broad-based<br>improvements including those in health<br>so short answer is absolutely yep just a<br>preliminary follow-up question I guess<br>to that would be yep perhaps a starting<br>point might be to look at the average<br>Gini coefficient and the high achievers<br>versus the lower is that something<br>you've looked at I'm sorry again look at<br>the average Gini coefficient in the high<br>achievers verses that I just as a sort<br>of hypothesis-generating exercise yep<br>that's a good comment what we'll do<br>though is I mean I've got you know I've<br>got a database set up and I one of the<br>issues about the Gini and other measures<br>of income inequality is that you know<br>I'm not going to be able to get<br>comparable inequality measures for 138<br>countries okay so but what I could do is<br>get an idea of what's going on is to do<br>exactly as you say okay but to more<br>precisely control you know to net out<br>the impact of potential impactive of<br>inequality on health achievement we need<br>you know we need cross country data for<br>it but yeah that would be a very useful<br>starting point I agree just a comment I<br>guess about the low achievers I just<br>wonder what the impact of the HIV<br>epidemic and yeah in those countries is<br>on mortality okay<br>another excellent excellent point okay<br>what I did was I repeated the analysis<br>for life expectancy using data from 2010<br>to 2015 so sort of post hiv/aids<br>pandemic now I know there's a lingering<br>impact still that I was trying to get a<br>sense to which the hiv/aids pandemic is<br>sort of not people not countries off<br>offer equilibrium with with income per<br>capita and and the answer is pretty much<br>the same results you still get<br>sub-saharan African countries dominating<br>the the low achieving race but it's a<br>I noticed though of this house the<br>sub-saharan African countries doing very<br>poorly I've also had a lot of civil war<br>stable and they'll I suspect there are<br>lots of reasons for that<br>besides the fact that they're African<br>yes I emphasize it's not that they're<br>African it's it's the it's the it's it's<br>the characteristics or the realities of<br>those countries places but but point is<br>this though it's a good point I come i<br>I've been anticipating this that's where<br>I've got this this piece of paper in my<br>hand I mean the question here is I mean<br>if you really wish to get out the impact<br>of variables other things as an economic<br>growth or income achievement on health<br>achievement then you know what would<br>those variables be and conflict is an<br>obvious one that I note though was<br>conflict point it will lower both income<br>per capita and it will lower health care<br>okay<br>so it might not alter over or under<br>achievement as I'm presenting here<br>tonight that it's certainly affected<br>that if I was to and maybe anticipating<br>some other questions if I had a you know<br>a list of control variables okay to try<br>and you know to try separate you know<br>non not growth or non income effect is<br>what would they be and and so knees are<br>related but you know I'd public<br>expenditure on health which starter are<br>available some data available and<br>private expenditure and health the<br>productivity of those expenditures<br>access to water and sanitation not I am<br>still list I you know I people know what<br>it's not going surprised but on that say<br>I'm looking at cross-country comparisons<br>you know conflicts are the prevalence of<br>natural disasters levels of governance<br>which would include political stability<br>note that embargo a was one<br>low achieving countries and and what's<br>happening in Zimbabwe right now and<br>education levels so you know I've got a<br>list of ten variables that I would like<br>to and trying to explain cross country<br>differences other than then income okay<br>I know there's a lot of other other<br>variables but keep in mind my focus here<br>is on cross country so I am I am<br>slightly constrained totally constrained<br>by availability of driving that reflects<br>really the list I've just identified I<br>are you going to look at the change and<br>income and the change and health status<br>over that 25-year period yeah what I've<br>got another set of results that looks at<br>rather than the rather than the that<br>it's a level living income per capita<br>it's the change in income per capita so<br>its growth and I compare that to changes<br>in the health variables as well now I<br>can't give you many insights as the<br>result of that but that's part of we're<br>like a sort of robustness testing and we<br>can we can look at these variables in<br>different ways and and we need to look<br>at levels as well as changes over time<br>so short answer yes but I can't give you<br>much more than that at this stage just<br>another question about looking over time<br>is there an opportunity to look at some<br>of those hypotheses on impact by looking<br>at changes over time so we're you know<br>places like South Sudan where there's<br>been conflict and instability where<br>prior to that there was more stability<br>or where there's been natural disaster<br>where you can look at a country and see<br>what happens when you have a sudden<br>impact or the HIV epidemic would be<br>another thing where you could look at<br>the onset and see before and after<br>another readily accessible source of<br>data that hasn't been mentioned yet you<br>mentioned water and sanitation but the<br>expanded program on Immunization has<br>also been present during this period and<br>measles in particular and to some extent<br>whooping cough and so on you know have<br>been major changes over this period and<br>of course it is something which is very<br>between countries so if it is that is<br>that a variable which you were thinking<br>of looking at CDs I'm not so sure about<br>cross country data availability that I<br>sufficient availability I was sure I<br>wouldn't get I mean there's debate about<br>how good the data is some other<br>countries but but it's it's available<br>for all of them and and and also because<br>it's quite a long time period as you<br>indicated there would be much greater<br>discrepancies in the first part of the<br>time period you're looking at then<br>perhaps in the later part I look I<br>acknowledged as I lose a lot of richness<br>in the data set by taking that average<br>so I might also add to you know that<br>people like David and I and Stephen who<br>work using developing country datasets<br>that have learned to live with data and<br>measurement errors I would just add on<br>methodological grounds as well if those<br>errors tend to be purely random we we've<br>got ways of addressing that but if it's<br>not random then we're in trouble and<br>we've just got to be we've got to take<br>you know a reasonable degree of<br>skepticism about our numbers but that's<br>where our qualitative research comes<br>into play and again I take that as an<br>argument forward-looking mixed methods<br>so can I just intervene I'm conscious<br>that we shouldn't trust trespass too<br>much on infectious diseases time so I do<br>apologize but I think this time for just<br>one more question but mark will be<br>around for a few minutes afterwards so<br>if you do have a question please do feel<br>free to come up and talk to him but<br>we'll just have one microphone question<br>that yeah is the way of categorizing the<br>way that health systems are organized<br>you know universal health access versus<br>other models for example - um my my very<br>honest answer is oh I'm not sure but I<br>do think I do understand the point<br>you're making and I think we would like<br>to address that in our search for<br>additional data I can also say I'm just<br>delighted that you know as an empiricist<br>to present scatterplots<br>I often sort of worried that when I come<br>into mixed audiences that I'm going to<br>send everyone asleep now I may have<br>might have come close to that at times<br>that the fact that you're still awake<br>and asked asking me questions I must<br>so thank you again indeed to Professor<br>MacGillivray for such a stimulating talk<br>we do have a small presentation now as<br>it happens one of our students who won<br>the the prize for the best poster<br>presentation this afternoon also quite<br>coincidentally before he learned that he<br>won the prize was lined up to present<br>the gift to mark so Yonatan could you<br>come forward now please and will we also<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
