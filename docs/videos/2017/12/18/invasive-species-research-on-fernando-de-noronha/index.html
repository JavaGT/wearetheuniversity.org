was discovered by the<br>Portuguese in the early 1500 since that<br>time it served as a portuguese fort<br>and penal colony and more recently a<br>brazilian military base with occupation<br>by the American from the jury during<br>World War one and World War two since<br>1988 the island has been freehold land<br>with a few thousand permanent<br>inhabitants Brazilians generally think<br>of the island is paradise and it does<br>have some of the most beautiful beaches<br>in the world here but the focus is<br>generally in the past in on marine<br>conservation emphasis on turtles and<br>dolphins the terrestrial aspects of the<br>island have tended to be neglected<br>Forest has been completely destroyed by<br>logging in fire and a number of release<br>of species in prison these include cats<br>or rats which you might normally find on<br>tropical islands around the world but<br>also some unique Brazilian invasive<br>species such as the Asian and mocha<br>which are actually native to continental<br>Brazil for the last three years I've<br>been collaborating with clear G the<br>Brazilian Institute conservation<br>medicine and the university of smell<br>Paulo to help do some baseline<br>population biology studies of the<br>impacts of the terrestrial invasive<br>species on foot and enters in their own<br>yet in particular I've been working on<br>the invasive rats and we've been<br>undertake the mercury capture studies<br>for three years across the wit and the<br>dry seasons to understand the population<br>dynamics what we've found is the density<br>of rats fluctuates from about 30 to 50<br>per hectare over the course of the year<br>when we first started studying<br>intelligence in Finland annoying and<br>Atari was introduced on the fifties<br>because that's that's the study people<br>tell in yellow but reading more about it<br>on the history books<br>we found the reporting entities it was<br>here on the early 20th century<br>so we now know it was it is here for at<br>least about 100 years and it's cousin<br>fact ever since don't know exactly how<br>big is that they are very big as well<br>you can grow up to five or seven killers<br>and up to 1/2 neither frontier to know<br>we wanted to know how many lizards are<br>in the islands at least an idea on<br>what's the size of the problem and I<br>made some marker captured studies and<br>also have made some transects census<br>counties and we found that we have at<br>least seven but up to twelve thousand<br>lizards in Indiana by now we also found<br>that their home ranges can be up to<br>seven actors and they are very much<br>everywhere but they use a lot of open<br>lands the rock cave is a species that is<br>native to Brazil it's a rodent<br>Kohi dean rodent it's related to vadas<br>and guinea pigs and listen I'm really<br>really really dry habitat in Brazil so<br>it has lots of interpretations for that<br>it hides from the Predators it doesn't<br>choose to fight and it even has a quite<br>interesting alarm system to identify<br>where the predator is coming from so<br>there are cases that are around the<br>colony they don't get face to face with<br>the Predators when they coming back to<br>the colony the Octavia was introduced in<br>Verona between 1967 and 1969 we have<br>some different versions of it but we<br>know that they were brought by the<br>military that occupied the island before<br>the island became touristic and they<br>brought it as a resource some sort of<br>back-up plan if the boat wouldn't arrive<br>in the island they would have their<br>activity on the island we can say that<br>their food source for cats for sure and<br>also regarding their impact in the<br>island we didn't really notice it to be<br>a negative impact or a heavily negative<br>impact we still have to study it further<br>but it seems that the rock cave is not<br>such a problem priority species here<br>Fernando de Noronha is a really<br>important conservation scientist it has<br>a number of unique species some of them<br>found only here the ma boo you lizard<br>actually has an origin from Africa and<br>is endemic to fernando de noronha<br>and it's also one of the hot spots of<br>seabird diversity in the tropical<br>Atlantic so by focusing on terrestrial<br>invasive species management we can<br>really help benefit the conservation of<br>these species often ended in the night<br>the main type of gas is the predation of<br>other animals and we made us an isotope<br>analysis and we found that the most out<br>of their diet is composed of a small<br>dessert which is native its combat wheel<br>and around one-third of their diet is<br>composed of the first most of them are<br>microfiber we spot by the case<br>throughout the iron and we counted<br>around 1,300 cats and most of them are<br>close to the people some of them are in<br>the<br>the outcome of this collaboration as we<br>could put forward an invasive species<br>management plan to a symbiote the<br>government agency in charge of<br>conservation through the National Park<br>of endangered and their own yet by<br>focusing on a flagship and conservation<br>species the endemic mabu you found only<br>on foodon and agenda dona they can set<br>up some management areas for invasive<br>wrap control and TV control and removal<br>of feral cats and look at options for<br>invasive species eradication on some of<br>the offshore islands such as rat<br>eradication or conservation of the<br>diversity of seabirds that have found on<br>foreign
