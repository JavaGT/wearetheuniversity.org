somewhere before<br>he's up there with the far Nana who has<br>taken time out from a busy role at one<br>of our other fine New Zealand<br>universities to be here welcome grant<br>I'd also like to acknowledge visitors I<br>say and Kelly pijo members of the far<br>now we may hear about tonight who have<br>provided generous and positive influence<br>and who have been positively influenced<br>themselves by the research that we will<br>hear about also acknowledge Karen Perry<br>not a one of our proud winners of our<br>prime minister supreme award for<br>tertiary teaching excellence who is one<br>of Perry's strong research collaborators<br>together with other collaborators<br>colleagues friends and supporters<br>welcome to you all my name is Richard<br>Blakey I'm the deputy Vice Chancellor<br>for research and Enterprise here at the<br>University of Otago and it's my great<br>pleasure to introduce this event to set<br>the celebration of a distinguished<br>research medal and to join you and<br>engaging in public lecture on the topic<br>related to the work that leads to parry<br>successful application for this award<br>as a celebration of the occasion we'll<br>also invite you to join us afterwards<br>upstairs for refreshments and<br>conversation we have professor<br>Guilford's head of department professor<br>Katherine day here to give a formal<br>introduction for Perry in this lecture<br>outlining the details of his career and<br>achievements that has<br>to this award but I just wanted to give<br>you some context as the person who has<br>the responsibility to chair the panel<br>that makes the recommendation to the<br>vice chancellor for the award of our<br>distinguished research men middle hanley<br>annually the distinguished research<br>medal is governed by regulations that<br>state that quote the university of otago<br>distinguished research medal award aims<br>to give recognition to outstanding<br>performance of individual researchers a<br>middle commemorating the war award will<br>be presented to each recipient at a<br>public lecture given by the recipient so<br>that's why we're here tonight and there<br>is a middle somewhere I believe the<br>basis for selection will be outstanding<br>scholarly achievement including the<br>discovery and dissemination of new<br>knowledge the development of innovative<br>technology or the development of<br>concepts that lead to significant<br>advancement in the activities of the<br>University and what we'll hear tonight<br>is the kinds of work that have met<br>fulfill all of those criteria and then<br>some now all of our academic departments<br>within our four academic divisions are<br>invited annually to submit portfolios<br>from their best and brightest researcher<br>or research team and solicit referees<br>reports from preeminent international<br>scholars to support applications then a<br>group chaired made myself and composed<br>of former distinguished research<br>medalists has the stimulating<br>challenging and an enviable task of<br>selecting the best of the best from<br>these nominations and it's it's really<br>it is a hard job but it's a very special<br>job and what makes it so special is that<br>we are selecting people into a highly<br>exclusive club in this process unlike<br>other Awards the Nobel Prize for example<br>where there might be up to three awards<br>made annually in a across each<br>discipline this is one award across all<br>of our disciplines at the university we<br>have just select across disciplines even<br>including mathematics for which there is<br>no Nobel Prize and we have to balance<br>overall career long scholarly<br>achievement with the discrete<br>world-changing discoveries that are<br>sometimes sufficient for other awards<br>and putting the scale in context we have<br>approximately<br>1600 academic staff here at the<br>University with only one distinguished<br>research medal awarded annually very<br>rarely a joint award and that means that<br>the club is very exclusive there are you<br>know fifteen or sixteen dra middles<br>midlist currently on staff so that<br>represents one percent of our academic<br>staff who are in this very exclusive<br>club consider also that to be appointed<br>into an academic position at the<br>University of Otago is also highly<br>selective typically we get a hundred or<br>even more application for any one<br>position which is another one percent<br>selection so already that's one percent<br>of one percent and then even getting to<br>the level of a PhD in an advanced<br>research qualification that makes you<br>eligible for applications into an<br>academic position is about another one<br>percent selection although here in<br>Dunedin 2% of our population is PhD<br>qualified we are officially the smartest<br>city in New Zealand and another one<br>percent of our population is studying<br>towards a PhD so with those three highly<br>selective processes it is clear that<br>this event that we are here to celebrate<br>tonight is to celebrate someone who is<br>the 1% of the 1% of a 1% in Dunedin<br>smarter City so Perry I think you are<br>now officially the smartest person in<br>New Zealand smarter City and I trust<br>that you'll be able to dine out on that<br>fact well until next year's award at<br>least but I know also you wanted me to<br>go to your head so Artie aki-nee that's<br>enough said from me so with that I'll<br>now ask professor day to come forward to<br>introduce you in the top of your lecture<br>tonight tena koe tu<br>tena koutou tena koutou tena koutou<br>katoa call catherine de Ojo call a ho t<br>Tomoaki or Tita teri ma - Korra so<br>welcome<br>I'm Kathryn day and I'm the head of the<br>biochemistry department and I'm really<br>honored to have this opportunity to<br>celebrate the research success of<br>Professor Perry Guilford<br>he's a long-standing member of our<br>department and we're all very proud to<br>be here tonight so Perry has too many<br>achievements for me to review and in<br>great detail and I will just and I<br>really you've come tonight to hear Perry<br>and not me so I will try and be brief so<br>just stuff really to touch on a few key<br>things Perry had his formal site for<br>began his formal scientific training at<br>the University of Otago receiving a DSC<br>and an MSC and biochemistry in the early<br>1980s this was followed by several<br>stints as a scientist at DSi R and I'm<br>no I'm sure Perry will mention that in<br>his talk and then a PhD at Cambridge in<br>1989 and the postdoctoral fellowship at<br>the Pasteur Institute he returned to the<br>biochemistry department in 1996 and has<br>been affiliated with the department<br>since then so a very long association<br>and over this time Harry has had many<br>achievements and really I highlighted<br>them in three brackets he's made seminal<br>contributions that have been published<br>in the very best scholarly journals and<br>I note his discovery of the ich head<br>here and mate mutation has been put was<br>published in Nature in 1998 and it has<br>now been cited over 1,000 times so<br>that's quite an achievement he's also<br>done research that addresses health<br>issues in the community and that is of<br>benefit to the communities and I think<br>and most significantly he's made a large<br>contribution to a Maori Bay of Plenty<br>family and again I'm sure he will speak<br>of that tonight and in the third arm of<br>his research is translation of his<br>research into commercial products and<br>this<br>again that was of what will be of wider<br>benefit to the community and again he<br>has been an inventor on 14 filed patents<br>two of which Agron granted so these are<br>three significant things and I think<br>many academics would be proud to count<br>any one of those achievements amongst<br>their career and to have succeeded in<br>all three domains is really why we're<br>here tonight to celebrate Perry's award<br>of the distinguished researcher medal so<br>it's a very fine achievement so just to<br>sort of highlight a few other things so<br>not surprising<br>Perry has received many other awards for<br>his research in 2013 he received the HRC<br>Bevin medal for translational health<br>research and he also that year received<br>New Zealand innovators Awards supreme<br>winner for the development of the CX<br>bladder test for Pacific now has been<br>his role with Pacific edge limited and<br>in 2014 Perry was awarded the Royal<br>Society Sir Charles hircus MIDI medal<br>for excellence in molecular cellular<br>biomedical and clinical sciences so all<br>fine achievements and last year he was<br>elected a fellow of the Royal Society of<br>New Zealand and recognition of these<br>about many are sustained outstanding<br>achievements so I won't dwell further on<br>his specific achievements and he is far<br>more qualified to talk to you about<br>these tonight however I do want to<br>highlight the many other ways that parry<br>brings great manner to the University<br>and makes an enormous contribution to<br>the science system in New Zealand and<br>most notably Perry is a member of the<br>HRC so the Health Research Council of<br>New Zealand's Board he's also a member<br>of the cancer trials New Zealand<br>advisory board member of the MB Science<br>Board and he also has a role as a deputy<br>director of the healthy live science<br>challenge again these are four large<br>roles that any one person would would<br>think was quite a task having all those<br>four roles as really a recognition of<br>Perry's our high peer esteem and the way<br>they're steamed in which his colleagues<br>help hold him so just in terms of the<br>Department and these really I think<br>these accolades that Perry has received<br>and his recognition are attributable to<br>Perry but have been built off of many<br>years of cancer research and the<br>biochemistry department and I think it<br>highlights the importance of taking a<br>very long view and making strategic<br>investments and research programs and I<br>think this is particularly investing in<br>people people and people again and<br>investing in equipment that enables<br>research and I think it's very important<br>that we continue to take such a long<br>view and that's how people of Perry's<br>ilk can succeed so well now for<br>something for Perry is very good because<br>this year he received an award of an HSE<br>program grant so five million over five<br>years as a large amount of money which<br>is excellent he also has substantial<br>funding from the healthy lives<br>science challenge and this enables his<br>research but there have been times where<br>I think funding has not been so<br>plentiful and I think just again we<br>should remember that this great success<br>is built over of sustained strategic and<br>thought to enable the activities and<br>people that people can flourish and<br>prosper in their areas in I think we're<br>very proud to be here tonight to<br>celebrate Perry's success and just<br>really that I think typical of Perry<br>just this morning I had met with him and<br>he was discussing plans for<br>implementation of his latest research<br>findings in the clinic and this<br>highlights always how Perry is thinking<br>to move things forward so in closing<br>professor Perry grill food has I think<br>displayed a sustained record of<br>scholarship research excellence and<br>research translation for the immediate<br>benefit of cancer sufferers or those who<br>at risk of cancer it makes them a unique<br>member of the University of OHS Targo<br>and an outstanding awardee of the 2017<br>distinguished research medal Perry we<br>are proud of you and we look forward to<br>hearing from you tonight thank you<br>Yakub role ringing theorem are they okay<br>- Oh whoo EMU yeah I could to attend a<br>poor core Iraqi Taku mana core why<br>turkey taco our core naughty guildford<br>tell you tell you we call peri gilpin<br>taco in Goa tena koe tu<br>tena koe tu tena Tata Kanto so thank you<br>very much<br>Katherine and Richard for those kind if<br>not slightly generous words about some<br>of my achievements which again I must<br>stress are built on a team working on a<br>history of research done at AG<br>University and other places as well by<br>my colleagues and so on really just an<br>example of what can be done in this<br>university and one of many and a large<br>team the the research one for bet today<br>I'll introduce it by a discussion on<br>cancer and how cancer develops so the<br>basis of cancer and hopefully that'll<br>give you special introduction to kind of<br>understand the principles of cancer then<br>I'll go on to talk about if four of the<br>area's we've been working in the last<br>several years to try and improve<br>outcomes for patients with cancer right<br>so animals try very very hard to avoid<br>cancer and they do this in numerous ways<br>they will use extremely advanced<br>mechanisms of immune surveillance they<br>will use various cellular tools to<br>repair damaged DNA they have numerous<br>sensors inside the cells which can<br>recognize stress and damage and then<br>stop the cell from dividing<br>they have enzymes in the cells which can<br>detect chemicals which are damaging and<br>which can be inactivated through<br>chemical means they have pubs which can<br>pump out compounds or or drugs from the<br>cell which may cause damage to those<br>cells and they have a really<br>extraordinary system of cell hierarchy<br>and programmed cell death which I'll<br>explain a little bit more in a snicks<br>lied with an every tissue in the bodies<br>of our tissue I mean and maybe liver<br>tissue maybe lung tissue and maybe<br>stomach tissue and maybe coal on tissue<br>the example I've got on the bottom as a<br>some colon cells in those tissues about<br>5% of the total cell content are what<br>are called tissue stem cells and these<br>stem cells are immortal they will live<br>through the life of the animal on the<br>organism and they will divide the<br>Phillie slow rate and they'll lead to a<br>population of progenitor cells which<br>will then divide rapidly to give you<br>some other cells which will be<br>differentiate and they will perform the<br>various functions required for a cell's<br>role in the body so the tissue stem<br>cells themselves are immortal as I said<br>but all those other cells the other<br>remain 95% are programmed to die so they<br>will perform their function then they<br>will be lopped off and they will die<br>which means most of the time if there's<br>any damage to a cell that cell will<br>won't care because it is going to die<br>anyway it's kind of it's going to mature<br>for a few days it'll carry out a job it<br>may make an enzyme it may make a protein<br>and may even make um some kind of<br>compound which is important to sell but<br>then it will die and it will always die<br>which means the cell is protected<br>dramatically 24 protection from cancer<br>risk because most cells are going to die<br>anyway so they undergo mutations or<br>various problems which could lead to<br>cancer those cells will not simply not<br>survive there we carry on dying but the<br>stem cells they are the ones where there<br>is risk so what could possibly go wrong<br>we've got all these amazing mechanisms<br>to prevent cancer what could possibly go<br>wrong<br>well clearly quite a lot because we see<br>cancer in every organism in a thing<br>which has more than two cells rub<br>together can develop cancer and will<br>develop cancer we see top right we see<br>melanoma in a snake<br>there's melanoma and a fish Posada<br>there's a brain cancer and a fly<br>remarkably believing in this one<br>remarkably shellfish get cancer the this<br>thing here is a cancer on a coral to the<br>left of that is a cancer on a roundworm<br>bottom row you can see the shark you<br>often get told that sharks don't get<br>cancer if we should buy shark cartilage<br>systems and health treatment don't buy<br>shark cartilage because sharks do get<br>cancer dinosaurs got cancer there's a<br>bone from a dinosaur from how many many<br>years ago also cancer was around in<br>those times and in amongst humans<br>through 15 million new cases of cancer<br>per year and in the human history that<br>goes a long way back as well 50 bbc1 of<br>the Pharaohs was found to have died of<br>prostate cancer 700 BC a Siberian were<br>scything King also was shown to have<br>died of prostate cancer so cancer has<br>been in the human history from the<br>beginning of time it is not a modern<br>disease it's a fundamental disease which<br>occurs in every organism with more than<br>one cell it could be worse of course if<br>you were a bacteria bacteria this is an<br>amazing fact there's a hundred million a<br>hundred thousand million million million<br>infections of bacteria every second and<br>so really it's not so bad being a human<br>so why is cancer so common we have all<br>these amazing techniques the cell will<br>use to minimize the risk of cancer so<br>why is it still so common<br>the answer is 37 trillion because there<br>are 37 trillion cells in the average<br>human body and each of these cells<br>carries the the<br>instructions for the entire human<br>capability that is 20,000 genes all the<br>genes which encode every function than<br>there is in a human body so if you carry<br>those 20,000 genes you also carry the<br>manual for cancer so fortunately<br>differentiate ourselves and 95 sinner<br>cells have critical instructions<br>redacted from the from the DNA their<br>chromosomes and this is done through<br>epigenetics where the genes will be<br>silenced by turning the DNA so Titans<br>and a gene cannot be turned on so most<br>genes are turned off that still leaves 2<br>trillion cells which the stem cells<br>which really have a fairly clean copy of<br>the body's genetic instructions so 2<br>trillion cells have access to 20,000<br>genes and all a capability at 20,000<br>genes can bring so cancer begins in<br>tissue stem cells and it begins through<br>the activation of capabilities which are<br>normally used by specialist cells so for<br>example they can proliferate rapidly<br>just like cells in a healing wound will<br>proliferate they can migrate like cells<br>in the embryo or migrate they can move<br>in and out of blood vessels like white<br>blood cells do they can coax blood<br>vessels to grow into them to provide<br>oxygen just as you would see in<br>repairing tissue they decrease their<br>alliance and oxygen just like oxygen<br>action starve tissues doing and they can<br>hide from the immune system system just<br>like cells in the colon often do so all<br>these tricks that are used by a cancer<br>cell as it develops and gains its<br>capability are really just taken from<br>the normal repertoire of skills that a<br>normal body hairs but because the cancer<br>has started in the stem cell has access<br>to all instructions the 20,000 genes and<br>it uses those to acquire the<br>characteristics it needs to be a fully<br>fledged cancer so of course all this<br>means that drugs that kill cancer cells<br>will also damage our normal cells as<br>well<br>cannot get around that fact with any<br>enemies at all because the processes of<br>Kent of a cancer are the same as process<br>at the normal cell you will always find<br>the drugs which cause which you use to<br>treat cancer will cause some damage some<br>side effects and the normal body as well<br>it's not like a virus it's not like a<br>bacteria or a fungus which brings in<br>foreign foreign techniques foreign<br>biochemistry these are processes which<br>are normal to the human body and<br>therefore you target them in a cancer<br>you'll also cause damage to the normal<br>tissue which is really the main reason<br>why cancer has been so hard to treat<br>over all these years so cancer has<br>acquired all these amazing capabilities<br>but how it does it actually do that we<br>know it can see the genes it has those<br>genes there but how does that she<br>acquire the right ones to become you<br>know to grow to invade it become<br>metastatic how does it actually achieve<br>that well there's only two steps<br>required to do that the first one is the<br>need to acquire DNA damage so the genes<br>are 20,000 genes must be undergo some<br>kind of damage which changes their<br>activities they'll have to be turned on<br>or turned off and so the cancer will<br>better acquire new capability by genes<br>been turned on or turned off so DNA<br>damage can occur in many ways it can be<br>caused by the environment so for example<br>customers and their cousins in the<br>environment so bad nuns get lung cancer<br>I don't know with a good lungs and<br>they're good nuns get lung cancer or not<br>but I suspect they probably do as well<br>you also have course having irradiation<br>when the environment can cause DNA<br>damage another example of environmental<br>vectors you can also get epigenetic<br>changes caused by their environment so<br>this is when the genome is effectively<br>that tightened or loosened to enable<br>access of various vectors to the genes<br>which are involved in cellular processes<br>the example of shown here is of a little<br>boy from the Dutch hunger winter so in<br>1944 1945 the last two years of the the<br>war in Europe<br>and there was a bit there's a blockade<br>by the German troops around the urban<br>areas in the Netherlands and this lasted<br>for almost a year and about<br>four and half million people were<br>blockaded off 22,000 people died during<br>this blockade and there was intense<br>starvation in this area during that<br>period but since then researchers in the<br>Netherlands have followed many of the<br>people those four half million people to<br>see how they have developed how their<br>lives have changed or been affected by<br>that period and what they observed lungs<br>makes other things was that they the<br>people who were buried alone children or<br>still in utero<br>at that time have grown older but with a<br>much lower rate of colon cancer so what<br>this means we're not too sure but you<br>could help suggest that maybe one reason<br>why we have such a high rate of colon<br>cancer in New Zealand is the opposite of<br>that we have our nutritional excess<br>rather than rather than a deficit but<br>that of course is speculation so the<br>last and probably the most important<br>single cause for DNA damage is bad luck<br>there are 3.2 billion nucleotides in the<br>human genome and you get one to three<br>random errors our more mutations<br>occurring every time a cell divides and<br>so this causes the changes to DNA which<br>can be occurring and important genes<br>involved in the processes which lead to<br>cancer so step two so the so this is a<br>cancer<br>acquires as capability step one was DNA<br>damage which provides a diversity in the<br>genetic material step two is simple<br>natural selection just as we were saw<br>well as Darwin saw with the finches in<br>the Galapagos Islands just as we see as<br>when humans have evolved from from Apes<br>through to what we are now just as it<br>we've seen you know snakes evolved into<br>lizards it's the same principle here<br>it's natural selection where there's<br>been a selection for cells with a growth<br>advantage and surely that's all it's<br>that cancer is cells with a growth<br>advantage this impact of mutations isn't<br>just causing the evolution what is the<br>initiation of cancer it's also very<br>important for how cancer evolves and<br>develops even through the course of<br>treatment so there's a few numbers here<br>which I<br>won't go through although I know how he<br>will become I'm turning to them right<br>now because you know been scientists you<br>probably will but don't worry about them<br>too much but the basic idea of those<br>numbers is that inside a cubic<br>centimeter of tissue there are five by<br>ten to the eighth cells so a remarkable<br>number of cells and the Cubist image of<br>tissue and so if there is cancer tissue<br>there's a lot of the cells in there<br>which undergo mutations and all the time<br>which means every nucleotide in a tumor<br>of that size could be mutated per year<br>somewhere in that cancer so some cell<br>and that tumor could be mutated so even<br>you could add in that and the genome<br>could be mutated somewhere in one cell<br>in that tumor which means that the<br>mutation that you don't want to see<br>because it's going to give you<br>resistance to your drug is already<br>present in the starting tumor which<br>means of course that the treatments that<br>we give patients now will always lead to<br>almost washes they almost always lead to<br>outgrowth of a resistant clone you will<br>see a response early on whether the<br>tumor will shrink and die away but then<br>there will be cells remaining which have<br>a mutation in them which could them<br>wisdom resistance and they will grow out<br>in time that is an inevitable and<br>there's something which will struggle to<br>accept but it is inevitable this has<br>been shown quite nicely by a study by<br>Charlie Swanson's group in the UK a few<br>years ago where he's taken a primary<br>kidney cancers that's a kidney tumor<br>there and he has taken different samples<br>from different points and that kidney<br>tumor and also the tumor has also spread<br>around that patients body so there's<br>lung admits there's chest warm it's so<br>there's multiple sites and his biopsied<br>multiple sites of this cancer and then<br>he's done DNA sequencing to identify the<br>mutations which have occurred in this<br>kind of you know whole tumor burden and<br>what he saw was this kind of evolution<br>of mutations and he could build his<br>trees it's far genetic trees of showing<br>how the new mutations have evolved in<br>different sub<br>of different branches of the tumor mess<br>and what's striking about this is not so<br>much that observation but for me it's<br>the similarity to Darwin's Tree of Life<br>you know sometimes of course I think<br>picture we first described this notion<br>of evolution and and evolution of the<br>species so exactly the same idea we see<br>evolution occurring in a really rapid<br>timeframe in a tumor and a patient so<br>evolution has been remarkable for<br>providing humans with a complexity and<br>their performance but it has come at a<br>price and that price is cancer so cancer<br>is inevitable unfortunately the wheels<br>will fall off at some stage but a lot of<br>people don't get a fair crack at life a<br>lot of people will not be around to see<br>their niece get married to see their<br>daughter graduate to see their<br>grandchildren born to travel to do<br>whatever they want to do they miss out<br>on those opportunities they may not even<br>get a chance to force a swan and the<br>back of an old car almost the full<br>richness of life and so therefore we<br>must continue with cancer research even<br>though it is inevitable we must continue<br>with cancer research because not<br>everyone gets a fair crack at life so<br>now I want to go and move into telling<br>you some of the work we've been involved<br>in so for short stories of the research<br>that I've been involved in over the last<br>few years while I've been at the tag<br>university these four stories all have<br>they have common features they are all<br>translational which religious means<br>we've always had the patient or clinical<br>outcomes in our focus there has<br>sometimes it does still involve basic<br>research but always the focus the<br>in-game has always been how do we get<br>this latest research to be applied to<br>patients to the clinic as soon as<br>possible and so even though you may be<br>doing basic research sometimes the<br>you'll be there be a crossroad and<br>you'll think well I can go that way<br>which will be really interesting or on<br>go that way which would be a faster<br>route to improve patient outcomes and so<br>the translational mindset will send you<br>down there faster route eating each<br>single time below channels are stress<br>all the translational workers built on a<br>basis of basic research we had relying<br>on years and years of basic research<br>done by people who have come before us<br>so we cannot be translational without<br>the work of the basic scientists the<br>research and these four stories is all<br>highly connected picton that very often<br>it involves families very often it<br>involves with patients and patient<br>samples very often or involves work with<br>with the clinical teams the oncologists<br>it's also very implementation heavy<br>which means vast amount of work has to<br>go and you know once you've made your<br>initial discovery you got your Nishal<br>idea advancement of work has to be done<br>to actually make that new idea something<br>which can be used and which is robust<br>and can be used in the clinic and as<br>people like to meet or oh stand up there<br>who's done in the hard yards a lot of a<br>lot of this work as well and that is<br>remarkably important it doesn't get you<br>know there's the same level of<br>publications but it is the critical part<br>of translational researchers<br>implementation and I applaud people like<br>to me who do that's so well also each of<br>these stories shows incremental<br>improvement and each is imperfect and I<br>I stress this because I think sometimes<br>we're afraid to try new things because<br>we're afraid of failure<br>we're also afraid not to say imperfectly<br>but it says she often we needed us make<br>that small incremental step and Linus<br>has been observed clearly by many others<br>before me in particular Robert Watson<br>what the inventor of the early radar<br>warning in World War two so Robert<br>Watson what I said give them the<br>third-best to go on with the second best<br>comes too late and the best never comes<br>and in Churchill the the guy the one<br>with with the moustache said the maxim<br>nothing prevails but perfection may be<br>spelled PA are a ly sis okay so denotes<br>this is the same idea I'm trying to get<br>across to you that you really have to<br>try things even though your ambition may<br>that you may not get to the perfect goal<br>the perfect diagnostic test the perfect<br>treat<br>and you can stall any muscle trying to<br>strive towards that goal with something<br>pepsin perfect when I was looking for<br>this Churchill quote I found another one<br>by Churchill which is unrelated but I<br>did find kind of amusing I only believe<br>in statistics that I adopted myself and<br>I heard Mick plaque using that same line<br>just this morning right so now into<br>those four stories the first story goes<br>back in some ways to 1864 and the Battle<br>of gate power so this is the battle<br>between night or any in Turanga against<br>the British troops and there was a<br>famous battle because the the the the e<br>we were surrounded by the British troops<br>who just decided to bombard them with<br>missiles for several days until of<br>course they would capitulated Megan<br>would they could have walk into the into<br>the power and just take over in Hitler<br>glorious victory and so they did that<br>they bombarded the path for several days<br>from several different angles and and<br>eventually the whole thing was reduced<br>to rubble they thought okay now we will<br>march and they marched in and found that<br>the the Mary had dug trenches and in<br>various hideaways and quite a maze and<br>there and many of them were just fine<br>thank you very much and so the British<br>got a fear thumping and it was a very<br>famous and very very important battle<br>for two reasons one was important<br>because it's a cedar that if the British<br>had acknowledged that defeat they would<br>not have got involved in trench warfare<br>and World War one the way they did but<br>also it was important and famous for the<br>humanity shown by the people on night<br>haranguing because when the battle was<br>raging people from the william taking a<br>woman not so much the sky here but<br>picking a woman were sneaking in to the<br>past site to bring water to the wounded<br>British troops and so the leader of the<br>British troops Lieutenant Colonel gamble<br>said not an Iranian enemy anything about<br>despicable either an intelligence or<br>courage there was in 1864 I am getting<br>it was something to do with cancer so a<br>hundred years later 1964 we see a<br>a paper published and he's in a medical<br>journal by a guy called Ted Jones as<br>some of you might recall he was a<br>graduate of matagi University as well a<br>medical graduate and he described a in<br>the journal a big family tree in which<br>which at the top there and read as a<br>princess of the night or any it's<br>married of a Pakeha male and from that<br>marriage and there is we see a sub ship<br>of numerous children who have gone on to<br>develop stomach cancer T it also said<br>the present survey on stomach cancer<br>seems to have done little more than<br>imbue the family with a deep sense of<br>Makuta or curse the curse that the<br>family believed had befallen was due to<br>the land behind the foreigner II here so<br>just up to the on the left on your<br>right-hand side you see the remains of a<br>quarry there and that land was quarried<br>in the 60s by the City Council to get<br>rocks to help the build the port in<br>tirana and the railway liners to Taronga<br>and of course the people have been in<br>the site for eight hundred years and so<br>when the land was dug up there were<br>bones found the land wasn't sacred but<br>was tap huland and the father had<br>believed that they were cursed because<br>they had sold the land to the City<br>Council and therefore they deserved the<br>cancer in their family the truth is the<br>land was taken from them under the<br>Public Works Act so they never deserved<br>to be cursed in the first place so to<br>1995 not harrangue again there were a<br>group of four of them in particular who<br>showed the intelligence and the courage<br>to say well this is not caused by a<br>curse this is caused by genetics and<br>they went out and found initially Tony<br>Gilliam and eventually myself to help<br>understand how the cancer was Karm<br>occurring and these families and how we<br>could whether we could develop a test<br>identify who was a greatest risk in<br>these and these families and that led<br>through you know numerous years numerous<br>many many many hours of work<br>to ask describing a new cancer syndrome<br>called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer<br>or HD GC which is caused by dominant<br>inheritance of germline cdh1 mutations<br>so a gene called cdh1 or ecad hiren and<br>so people who inherited germline<br>mutation in the cdh1 gene or he could<br>here in gene have a lifetime risk of l<br>70 percent of getting diffused type<br>stomach cancer i wore which piece type<br>gastric cancer the same thing i swapped<br>between gastric and some except as the<br>same in the same condition and they also<br>have the woman have about a 40% risk of<br>lobular breast cancer as well so since<br>we found that first mutation and what we<br>call family a and not irony though at<br>least 500 families worldwide have been<br>identified with germline cdh1 mutations<br>and so what first started with the<br>efforts of a farno in tirana has now led<br>to a clear cancer syndrome which has<br>benefited you know hundreds and hundreds<br>of families around the world and<br>thousands of individuals who carry the<br>germline mutation<br>well it's quite striking in New<br>Zealanders that is around about twenty<br>puppy with few more in our families in<br>New Zealand of whom 13 have of Mario<br>origin and a probably about 400 pyaari<br>carry mutations that see in the cdh1<br>gene one of our students in the lab<br>Chris hair cards recently showed that<br>13% of all Maori diffused type stomach<br>cancer cases have a germline ch1<br>mutation so these figures are probably a<br>lot higher than the rate you would see<br>in non marry in packing our families and<br>it suggests perhaps the that Maori may<br>have higher instances of this mutation<br>because of some evolutionary advantage<br>and I'll touch on that point a little<br>bit later on so we're able to you know<br>with our international colleagues build<br>up some guidelines like the guidelines<br>are how best to manage families with<br>germline cdh1 mutations so the basic<br>idea is that at about age 16 you will<br>have a gene dis<br>blood samples taken in and they'll<br>search for the mutation and your family<br>and then the recommendation if you had<br>the mutation is that you'll have<br>I guess tricked me you'll have your<br>stomach removed just the whole thing<br>removed and then just rejoined a little<br>bit more complex than that but that's<br>the basic idea and if you don't want to<br>have your stomach removed just like that<br>based on the gene test you can undergo<br>surveillance by endoscopy every year or<br>so and then if they find a cancer then<br>you will have your stomach removed and<br>that process of surveillance will carry<br>on until such time as something has<br>found or perhaps you might go many many<br>years and be okay so that is the way<br>it's dealt with so has it been useful<br>well yes it has this is the night<br>Turangi data I think it's the only graph<br>I'm going to show you fortunately so<br>this is the their cases and in that II<br>we so they saw they had you know five to<br>seven cases every ten years for you know<br>was probably as far back as we can<br>remember and in the last five years has<br>been no cases and so clearly the cancer<br>is under control in in family a in<br>nighter any and it's the same story in<br>families all around the world this is an<br>amazing family from Wisconsin so in the<br>middle is Karen Shakman scriber she is<br>the the founder of a HD GC support group<br>called no stomach for cancer and here<br>she is with her brother and her nephew<br>showing off we would call him scars but<br>she calls them their lifelines those are<br>their lifelines and so amazing family<br>and they're all doing extremely well<br>because they were chosen to have gastric<br>Tamizh and they're therefore they have<br>no risk of this disease and this is<br>photograph this is taken in Philadelphia<br>at a meeting organized spiked by Karen<br>for for families with HD GC and and the<br>only galoot in that photograph where the<br>stomach is the one lying down everyone<br>else as this had their stomachs removing<br>you see most of them looking really well<br>one to a stool quite soon out after<br>surgery is still not looking so so well<br>but most of them have put on good weight<br>in their living good healthy nor<br>perfectly normal lives because of the<br>surgery so as one of the Kimoto and<br>night rang you said to me perhaps things<br>are getting better now because the hill<br>is beginning to heal<br>right story number 2 to me Torah out<br>there and the photograph this is about<br>Pacific age since 2001 Tony or even<br>myself and a few others founded Pacific<br>age limited and we founded it because we<br>were frustrated by funding we had we<br>could keep on going with our research<br>but we never had enough money to<br>implement our research so we could get<br>the basic ideas in place but we never<br>had enough to take it forward and<br>actually change clinical practice so so<br>Tony and I were determined to find new<br>sources of money to bring that about and<br>so we went down the commercial route to<br>try and achieve that the unlined<br>technology was what was called<br>microarray and simply it was a way to<br>look at the expression or the activity<br>of every single gene in the genome in a<br>single experiment and up till then we<br>had done things a gene at a time one<br>gene out of 20,000 of time you come up<br>with a hypothesis you go I've got a<br>really good idea and you would do an<br>experiment then you get our well that<br>wasn't right I've got another hypothesis<br>you'd repeat the process until<br>eventually would make some progress but<br>with microarray you could look at every<br>single gene a single experiment and it<br>was therefore remarkably powerful<br>because you would find changes much more<br>easily in gene expression changes in<br>cancer and you could always understand<br>the context of any particular change and<br>so incredible technology which was<br>unbiased by our rather poor hypotheses<br>and so Pacific age has gone on to use<br>that technology to develop like tears<br>for pelicans and the logic of the test<br>is really quite simple as a cancer<br>develops inside the bladder<br>it will cells will fall off that tumor<br>and they'll end up in the urine those<br>cells being cancer cells will have<br>certain genes more active for than other<br>cancer cells and so what the company<br>does is it measures expression of four<br>cancer genes and they have high<br>expression the cancer cells compared to<br>normal cells it's as simple as that<br>but the the the real job has been to<br>implement that technology into clinical<br>practice and I'll come into that more on<br>the next slide but what the company has<br>done is now developed for different<br>bladder cancer tests which for different<br>parts of the clinical needs so for<br>example those tests for you know early<br>screening tests of people who present<br>with symptoms and a test for people who<br>have been monitored for recurrent<br>disease so you know incredible effort<br>but yeah<br>vast amount of that workers<br>implementation research which is very<br>very hard yards this is just a slide<br>which just gives you some idea of how<br>the test is working how the test can be<br>useful this is called CX butter this is<br>one of those tests so what's been done<br>here is the a group of eighteen<br>neurologists have been given data from<br>30 patients who have real patients who<br>have been are being treated for possible<br>bladder cancer and so the patients have<br>been the data has been analyzed by each<br>of the clinicians and he decided what<br>treatments they would do what procedures<br>they do know what they do do cystoscopy<br>invasive or flexible would they do a<br>contrast CT scan would they do a Paula<br>Graham and then they were then so that's<br>all we done they sat down the look at<br>those 30 patients made the decisions and<br>how they would deal with those patients<br>and then they've been given the C X<br>bladder the true actual C X better<br>results from those patients and then<br>asked the same question again how would<br>that change your management and so here<br>for the box is green it means they would<br>do less though do you know one less<br>procedure than they would have before if<br>the box is red they'll do more<br>procedures and so above the black line<br>the patients who had a positive C<br>explained a test and you see they're<br>getting more procedures because they are<br>positive for the C X noticed they almost<br>certainly have bladder cancer and so<br>resources have been piled into that<br>group of patients whereas the big group<br>below are the ones who are CX better<br>Niger from their tests and the<br>collisions now say well it's okay we can<br>take resources away from those patients<br>that probably be fine we don't need to<br>get them nearly as much intensive<br>treatment so what we're seeing over all<br>and through the work in the company is a<br>15 to 44 percent overall reduction in<br>invasive procedures to Pinzon whether<br>it's for surveillance or whether it's<br>for monitoring and we know what that<br>reduction is but around about overall<br>about a 30 percent reduction in the<br>number of invasive procedures and so<br>this has now been picked up fortunately<br>by the DHBs in New Zealand and I think<br>I'll even hit the DHB<br>in Dunedin before<br>too long and it's very very powerful<br>technology because it's pushing<br>resources away from those who don't need<br>it onto those who most need that<br>technology Story number three is<br>circulating tumor DNA so circulating<br>tumor DNA is DNA which is released by<br>the tumor into the bloodstream and you<br>recognize circulating tumor DNA by<br>sequencing the the blood and identifying<br>the presence or absence of mutations and<br>genes involved in cancer so the great<br>strength of this technology is it as<br>highly specific you don't have mutations<br>in cancer genes in general unless you<br>have cancer so it's a technique which<br>you can use which is very very specific<br>you don't have high backgrounds as with<br>other techniques and it can be used as a<br>personalized essay to measure individual<br>disease burden for patients who have<br>been diagnosed with disease you can use<br>it to follow their progress through<br>treatment we have a project funded by<br>healthier lives on sickbed and human DNA<br>we were looking at colorectal cancer<br>melanoma and we've also got other<br>funding from other sources we the HRC<br>the stomach cancer and various other<br>groups for breast cancer as well and<br>even we had pediatric cancers and we're<br>asking the question does CTD and icicle<br>and human DNA enables to protect<br>treatment response faster than standard<br>technologies such as CT scans and then<br>most importantly we have to adapt a<br>technology to new zealand conditions so<br>this is an international we're not we're<br>not the only group doing this there's an<br>international initiative but we have to<br>adapt the techniques to the new zealand<br>conditions and we also have to build<br>some kind of implementation pathway<br>which i stressed earlier on there's<br>terribly important to getting things<br>done we have to spend a lot of time and<br>on implementation and we'll build a<br>pathway hopefully with healthier lives<br>funding for all cancers so to give you<br>an idea what we mean by established an<br>essay for New Zealand conditions I'll<br>give you one example work done by my<br>very good students Sarah Sarah parrot<br>Parrikar where she looked at the<br>stability of sickbed and human DNA over<br>time so when the samples is left on the<br>bench but in a particular tube was a<br>stable and<br>and she found that using a particular<br>tube called a roast tube the DNA will<br>stay warm for two weeks so that's great<br>because in New Zealand you know what<br>happens don't you<br>if you live in Cara Mia and you have a<br>blood sample which has to go to a lab<br>somewhere in Dunedin it will go on the<br>bus and they'll go on the bus and all<br>countdown and I'll go down to the lowest<br>pass and all go down to here in moots<br>and they'll do a little loop around<br>there the bus will stop in Christchurch<br>for Easter I'll restart it'll go to<br>mount cook pick up a parcel come down on<br>the piggery to be back in Dunedin after<br>about you know 11 days 12 days we know<br>our sample will be sailors table for 14<br>days and so that's what I mean by dip<br>into New Zealand conditions we have to<br>be able to do things in a way where it's<br>done in New Zealand style which can be<br>quite slow we need to be on top of the<br>costs because we can't simply buy<br>something off the shelf from Roche or<br>some other big US company because you<br>can guarantee remember to afford at all<br>we need to have the bottle open we need<br>to understand the mechanism in these<br>tests so we can adapt them keep the cost<br>down and using best clean Zealand<br>population so here's a bit of data from<br>four patients from Dunedin who were<br>followed through the course of their<br>treatment so these are all patients with<br>colorectal cancer and they're undergoing<br>chemotherapy for those came for that for<br>that cancer so the arrow shows the start<br>of the treatment so you see the the<br>first patient in their patient a they've<br>had they've got a very high level of a<br>particular mutation in the gene called<br>APC so aim is what 1400 copies per mil<br>of plasma and that has fallen away in<br>two weeks time to be undetectable in<br>that patient and in the stayed it<br>understandable levels throughout the<br>course of that patient's treatment so a<br>fantastic result the clearly treatment<br>is working very very well in their<br>patient patient be pretty good filly<br>rapid decline in the markers with a<br>particular marker and tp53 gene it's<br>declined quite nicely but it's sudden<br>the plateau out hasn't quite got to been<br>undetectable and at the end hint of a<br>rise in that last cycle so perhaps<br>already was time to see resistance<br>developing in that patient so the bulk<br>of the tumor has been killed but this<br>means themselves but stayed behind which<br>of nao-san are now got room to move I've<br>got more blood<br>I've got more space got more oxygen and<br>I'm now going to develop and grow so<br>maybe we've seen that in that patient in<br>there already patients see well that's a<br>different story again the patient has<br>just laughed at the treatment or the<br>cancer has at least and so the tumor has<br>continued to grow throughout the<br>treatment so two weeks it's probably<br>doubled in size and even you know higher<br>and higher as the treatment has gone on<br>so you despite intensive chemotherapy<br>regimen the patient's tumor is just<br>growing through that treatment patient D<br>is one where we see a different kind of<br>pattern so initially there seems to be a<br>growth in the cancer at the start of<br>treatment but then perhaps I haven't<br>seen the kind of called information yet<br>but a perhaps has been an adjustment of<br>the treatment for that patient maybe<br>they put another drug on maybe they've<br>increased the dose maybe something else<br>has changed but it started to fall away<br>again in a sudden drop away quite nicely<br>I mean her inhaled at a low level so<br>that's the type of data we can see and<br>we can do this really for practically<br>every single cancer patient that there<br>is undergoing intensive treatment for<br>cancer<br>and so you see how it gives us animal<br>nough switch wasn't available before<br>previously you would have to wait you<br>know 8 10 12 weeks to have a CT scan and<br>then the collision was oh well looks<br>like your cancer is getting better or it<br>looks like your cancers getting worse so<br>we'll try something else now there's a<br>chance to actually move the whole game<br>into a matter of you know one or two<br>weeks you could say the tumor is clearly<br>responding very well to this drug will<br>carry on or vice versa the tumor has<br>just not responding to this drug let's<br>change it immediately so incredibly<br>powerful technology which applies really<br>to most cancer patients so the<br>applications we think of a sickbed in<br>human DNA 1 SS wonders you can stop the<br>futile treatment you don't keep a<br>patient carrying on through chemotherapy<br>so you know 6 8 12 weeks when it is<br>doing no good at all you could think<br>about new ways to reduce or increase<br>drug doses so if the patient is doing<br>well so when those patients who drop<br>down to you know to zero maybe you could<br>think about easing back those doses and<br>okay I'm a really kind of safe rational<br>ways ease those doses back so there's<br>less toxicity the patient feels a lot<br>better and you can just keep it very<br>very close eye on those levels and if<br>they start to rise you know you might<br>have to increase dose again but it's a<br>way to kind of to<br>you late the treatment that you give to<br>patients almost in real time and I think<br>it'll also lead to possibly a new<br>science of our maintenance therapies<br>where you develop new types of drugs new<br>ways to treat patients which will<br>maintain a drug is a crime disease<br>rather than something which is more<br>explosive than that so that's something<br>which I think more will seem more up in<br>the future and it probably will require<br>more thinking about population genetic<br>principles importantly I think because<br>that you could see on college is a<br>chance to do very quick assessments of<br>new treatments so you know I think<br>though often you know quite rightly<br>they're very concerned to try a<br>treatment on the off chance that might<br>work when they have to really give it<br>several weeks to to be compton' that<br>give another fear go with this<br>technology you could really try<br>something and within two weeks make a<br>decision whether the treatment is one<br>you want to keep or change something<br>else it could be used to confirm<br>uncertain CT and Pitts findings so quite<br>often people will have a scan and<br>there's a strange looking shadow or lump<br>the anything what's that and not quite<br>clear what are those there's a real<br>chance to use a technology to actually<br>make a much clearer diagnosis or<br>clarification of CT and PET scan data<br>you could identify a tumor heterogeneity<br>so by sequencing the blood that's the<br>city DNA is straight from the blood<br>identifying new mutations you can see<br>how a tumor might be evolving and<br>therefore choose new treatments to treat<br>that patient and we've also just started<br>a project recently we were going to try<br>and develop circulating human DNA as a<br>primary diagnostic tool and we have the<br>initial focus will be on the Pacific<br>Islands where of course can't diagnosis<br>has probably presented with a large<br>obvious lump and if we can take this<br>technology to place on the islands and<br>get a simple blood sample sent to either<br>Lebanese Illinois lab and in the islands<br>we might be have a way to get much<br>earlier diagnosis of cancer and patients<br>in those resource-poor areas we can also<br>reduce the reliance and ct/pet scans<br>which of course are expensive they<br>require a hospital visit and so what we<br>hope we can do with this as migrate<br>surveillance away from the hospital from<br>the hospitals more to the community more<br>to the primary care setting<br>so this will be very important I think<br>to reduce inequalities in health care<br>and that supplement marry Pacific people<br>were about to have their care in the<br>communities on the Mirai for example and<br>with a list need to travel to the<br>hospitals for CT or PET scans and the<br>same for you know for anyone in the real<br>community they will be able to have a<br>follow-up checkup by simply providing<br>the blood sample at the local their<br>local health clinic or or the the rural<br>health nurse so great opportunity to<br>reduce inequalities both moba cific<br>people but also in rural populations so<br>Story number four is the prevention and<br>treatment of cdh1 mutant cancers so I<br>told you before about HTG see the<br>stomach cancer syndrome which is caused<br>by germline mutation as a cdh1 we have a<br>real need to try and develop a bit of<br>treatment so the gastrectomy the removal<br>the stomach it works and I'm proud to<br>say we've got people in the audience<br>who've had that procedure Nate and they<br>look fantastic but you know I think they<br>would also agree that there must be a<br>better way than such serious surgery as<br>I get stricter me and so we're working<br>on trying to develop drugs which will<br>develop but which will prevent the<br>development of cancer in those families<br>also those cdh1 mutations are really<br>common and sporadic cancer as well so<br>not only in families but also and people<br>without a family history so diffuse<br>gastric cancer there are 400,000 new<br>cases per year on that type of cancer<br>Lobby to breast cancer in 150 thousand<br>new cases a year so really quite common<br>cancers they have cdh1 mutations and<br>therefore anything we develop for CDH<br>one factor for the families will be also<br>very useful for a much wider population<br>base as well so how are we going about<br>doing this cdh1<br>or ich adhering is a tumor suppressor<br>gene which means it's a break on a cell<br>and so it's inactivated and kennen<br>cancer so the break is removing cancer<br>so the cancer cells can divide more<br>rapidly and they can divide more rapidly<br>and they're also migrate more rapidly<br>they'll move around the body more easily<br>more rapidly so you get rapid more rapid<br>invasion or epidemic test assess windows<br>need get here a mutation but the must<br>this loss of ecad here and<br>must also come as some other cost it<br>can't simply be all gained you can't<br>simply get you know in the cell<br>something as evolved as a human cell you<br>cannot get all gained by knocking out an<br>important gene like cdh1<br>there must be a cost somewhere and so<br>what we're trying to do is we got what<br>that cost is and when we find that cost<br>how do we exploit that cost so just to<br>keep it very very brief we've been<br>trying to identify vulnerabilities and<br>in cells which have mutations in the<br>cdh1 gene and basically what we've we<br>seemed to see is that the membrane is<br>disrupted in these cdh1 mutant cells and<br>so that they don't signal quickly inside<br>the cell we see various processes such<br>as in desert aces as operating correctly<br>we find numerous receptors in the cell<br>service don't work quickly and I think<br>it all comes back to a failure of those<br>cells whether you could hear mutation<br>tip not connect correctly with inside<br>layers of the the actin cortex so we<br>think that is an area of great<br>vulnerability and you get here and<br>negative cells which we can toggle with<br>drugs and SPECT we've seen that already<br>we've found using various chemical<br>inhibitors various drugs we've been able<br>to show that we could inhibit various<br>types of receptors various processes<br>such as intercept OSIS such as<br>cholesterol distribution membrane and<br>see more depth in the cdh1 mutant cells<br>then in the wild-type cells so we think<br>we've got a way in to treat cells which<br>have a mutation in cdh1 which will leave<br>the cdh1 wild-type or normal cells<br>relatively unscathed I mentioned earlier<br>on that we see this higher rate of cdh1<br>mutations germline mutations in Maori<br>families and us does it perhaps indicate<br>a increased or an advantage in an<br>evolutionary sense for the prompt for<br>married people by having those mutations<br>and we doesn't work some years ago where<br>we showed that certain eco hero<br>mutations made those cells partially<br>resistant to infection with the the<br>bacteria which causes listeriosis<br>there's also been a recent paper which<br>talked about the migration of Maori from<br>the Cook Islands in about the 14 about<br>1450 and they suggested that migration<br>was driven by an outbreak of food<br>poisoning caused by the singularity oxen<br>so this is a toxin which is produced by<br>algae which accumulates in the reef fish<br>and then dementia gets into the human<br>population and it causes very intense<br>food poisoning and often cardiac events<br>and death and so this paper described<br>the likelihood that that might have<br>occurred in the mid 1400 and driven them<br>in the migration for the Cook Islands to<br>New Zealand and so it makes you wonder<br>because that this toxin works by<br>activating the voltage-gated ion<br>channels and we know and he get here in<br>negative cells those channels aren't<br>working quite right so we would we would<br>hypothesize or speculate more correctly<br>that perhaps the adhere mutation is to<br>given a degree of resistance to things<br>like seguirá toxin or Listeria or other<br>bacteria through evolution and therefore<br>those mutations have been selected for<br>you know today of course it's not a good<br>thing because people live live a longer<br>life but perhaps pre-european tons I<br>think the average life expectancy was<br>about 35 years so you probably won't see<br>much cancer in anyway so just<br>speculation but I think is some worth<br>giving some thought so really just to<br>finish it a few thoughts on how I see<br>cancer treatment in the future and how I<br>think cancer will be seen as a chronic<br>disease and years to come just as we now<br>see diabetes is conquering disease I<br>think we'll see cancer as a kind of<br>season years to come<br>they'll be progressing on all fronts I<br>think so in the area of prevention I<br>think we'll start to find low frequency<br>high impact environmental risk factors<br>which are you know causing cancer so at<br>the moment the focus is on factors which<br>are common across the population like<br>you know dietary factors like smoking<br>which you know very common across the<br>population but heavy someone have quite<br>a modest if it's not smoking but others<br>have quite a modest effect yeah bacon<br>does bacon really cause that much cancer<br>well does it cause a bit of cancer<br>across the whole population quite a big<br>deal probably but for an individual<br>maybe<br>such a big deal but I think we're going<br>to see in future by using genetic<br>methods to identify people at highest<br>risk on certain mechanisms we're going<br>to find that some people with certain<br>genotypes will have higher I mean a very<br>very high risk of particular<br>environmental risk factors and I think<br>we'll see a lot more work in that area<br>in the future I think we'll see a lot<br>more use of chemo prevention to reduce<br>cancers selective advantage in high-risk<br>groups in particular in terms of<br>screening Diagnostics I think we'll see<br>a lot more use of indwelling diagnostic<br>devices so things we've put inside the<br>tissue inside blood vessels to sample<br>the blood in real time to give us data<br>on presence or absence or particular<br>cancer markers probably circulating<br>human DNA markers will be commitment<br>amongst those and those of course now<br>allow us to find cancer early and cure<br>the cancer by surgery in treatment I<br>think we'll see a shift towards the<br>application of population genetics more<br>often so your controller to the tumor in<br>a way we you try and avoid outgrowth of<br>more aggressive clones which you do not<br>have treatments for so they will try and<br>maintain a tumor there you won't destroy<br>it you'll maintain it that you will<br>control the outgrowth of clones which we<br>know you want struggle to cure I think<br>there'll be increased use of<br>immunotherapy in coming years and<br>importantly I think we'll use drug<br>combinations which anticipate resistance<br>right at the start of treatment so you<br>will not wait for the resistance develop<br>you'll know it will come and time and so<br>you will treat where the combination of<br>drugs early on which anticipates the<br>later resistance and I think importantly<br>as I mentioned earlier on will be more<br>treatment flexibility because of the use<br>of circulate and human DNA I think the<br>doctors will be able to just try things<br>for a short period of time see how it<br>goes and make a mix and match things<br>much more quickly and easily than they<br>do now so to me there'll be the major<br>changes we'll see which I think will<br>turn cancer into a chronic disease in<br>how long in my lifetime so the research<br>carries on because it is our common<br>cause because we care for those amongst<br>us who<br>struggling through no fault of their own<br>and because there we all go up the grace<br>of God or the three of the dice and with<br>that note I'll acknowledge a few people<br>of course my own I have family up there<br>and they several rows back wonderful to<br>see you there<br>I want to of course the knowledge the<br>families and the families involved in<br>cdh1 research we've got three members of<br>under families Justin and mother front<br>rows as well now without their support<br>their encouragement we were not doing<br>you this work Kim your hora health<br>clinic which is the one from from night<br>irani who did all that early research<br>and cdh1 of course they were the drivers<br>of that project the can see laboratory<br>all the people from the lab a wonderful<br>group of people Department of<br>Biochemistry a great laboratory a great<br>department to work and so thank you very<br>much Catherine for creating that<br>environment and cooked before that as<br>well<br>Pacific AIDS limited people like to me<br>up there and then Tony lock somewhere up<br>there as well and many others from the<br>company who do all those really hard<br>yards now we can come up with some ideas<br>and that's quite easy it can only take a<br>year or two but it's the Hajj as time my<br>people like had to me and Tony which get<br>these tests into the clinic who really<br>needs the applause and congratulations<br>and finally of course the must<br>acknowledge you know one of the<br>wonderful funding organization is the<br>Health Research Council in particular<br>healthier lies<br>New Zealand Breast Cancer Foundation and<br>the Karen and Louisa trusts I'll leave<br>it there thank you<br>you just stand over there for a bit<br>Perry got a few more words to say before<br>we invite you all for refreshments<br>because we have a very important thing<br>to do we have to invite the Vice<br>Chancellor up to award you the<br>distinguished research medal but I just<br>want to comment on the significance of<br>your lecture before that very briefly<br>firstly for you the significance is we<br>didn't tell you with us this is a test<br>as well giving the lecture is a<br>requirement before you receive the award<br>and in fact you're all examiner's and so<br>if you think that Perry has shown us<br>that sufficient excellence then please<br>join me in thanking Perry again<br>so what I've taken from your lecture<br>tonight Perry is that you exemplify<br>everything that we want to see in our<br>outstanding researchers there that again<br>and our national framework of research<br>excellence and impact our pillars that<br>we stand upon and where excellence is a<br>necessary but not necessarily sufficient<br>condition or requirement for much of our<br>research if you find a way to translate<br>research into something that will that<br>will be of use to people and communities<br>you have an obligation and you actually<br>take pleasure in seeing that research<br>translated and we've seen that tonight<br>with your story of evolution families<br>and cancer how built on basic<br>understanding from yourself and many<br>many others you've found ways and told<br>us and four stories how that research<br>can become translational or aspire to be<br>translational and I know you've got a<br>lot of other aspirations with people<br>like Karen of actually saying that this<br>will be a story of evolution families<br> popper and cancer and I know that<br>some of our funding agencies we're not<br>quite wise enough to to allow you to<br>explore is quickly and rapidly those<br>aspects of incorporating popper<br>and indigenous knowledge into your<br>research to allow better understanding a<br>bit a better translation so I'm a very<br>strong advocate for the kinds of things<br>that you are doing with your colleagues<br>in expanding that that realm to get<br>between those pillars of excellence in<br>Impact<br>ideas of collaboration and translation<br>to get the best out of the research for<br>the people for whom it matters that the<br>public of New Zealand and around the<br>world I think we've all seen a wonderful<br>talk I won't say anymore because I'm the<br>one standing between you and your middle<br>so I'd now like to invite the<br>vice-chancellor professor Holland Haines<br>to come and present you with the 2017<br>so it is just left to me to thank<br>everyone for attending this fantastic<br>event and to invite you all to join us<br>for some refreshments in the College of<br>Education Tea Room which is just in the<br>back of the auditorium and on behalf of<br>the University Perry I think you can see<br>that the audience all agreed that this<br>was a very well deserved honor I think<br>one of the things that has always<br>impressed me about Perry's research is<br>that it's not only world-class but it's<br>also very useful so it's a great honor<br>to present the medal to you today thank<br>you very much</p></main><footer
