children receive during<br>those early years now childcare of<br>course generally needs childcare outside<br>the home<br>I hasten and I'm interested in childcare<br>within the home as well as outside but I<br>began to look into the kind of situation<br>that prevailed for children who were in<br>some kind of substitute care outside the<br>home and found that by and large in<br>their abilities we had closed our eyes<br>to the fact that it occurred there are a<br>number of problems and many of them<br>sentences that center around the<br>licensing I feel that the licensing<br>regulations are really quite inadequate<br>for instance at the moment there are two<br>pilots two grades of license and a life<br>that's gonna be licensed and it's<br>possible to run a center with a be light<br>without telling any of the start having<br>any recognised qualification was taught<br>and even for an a license is only<br>necessary for one person to have the<br>life to see to have any qualifications<br>and that person's over that you need to<br>be in the center all the time it's<br>possible for the only trained person to<br>be away on two weeks holiday and for the<br>center to continue to run then as far as<br>the regulations go the number of adult<br>children that are required in my<br>judgement are quite it's nothing like<br>high enough you only need to have one<br>adult for every ten children or two to<br>five year old and I would really like to<br>somebody who made those regulations with<br>forty children in our center with four<br>adults for a wet day and they would do<br>to my to change the regulations because<br>child care can take many forms from<br>casual sometimes unpaid care my<br>neighbors are relative to full daycare<br>by trained paid staff in an institution<br>there is a demand for childcare during<br>the day particularly for infants and<br>preschool children but increasingly for<br>school-aged children after school is<br>over at the present time in New Zealand<br>we do have a casual attitude to the<br>childcare one couldn't conceive of any<br>untrained person being allowed to<br>operate a school yet we allow untrained<br>people to operate childcare centers the<br>damaging effects the children are<br>unmeasurable dr betty caldwell director<br>of the center for child development and<br>education at the university of arkansas<br>is a noted researcher in early childhood<br>education who visited New Zealand in<br>1977 dr. coddle believes that we can't<br>afford to be casual about childcare<br>because early experiences are crucial<br>for human development well I think that<br>if there is any critical period in which<br>that is more important for development<br>than another it has to be those very<br>early years of life and they are<br>critical from the standpoint of neuro<br>physiological maturation from general<br>psychological development from social<br>development and so on there's just no<br>question but that we need to pay more<br>attention to how children develop during<br>those years and the kinds of experiences<br>we make available for them as a matter<br>of fact I've said in a paper somewhere<br>other that you could come to the point<br>of accepting this as a critical period<br>from any number of tracks example<br>research in neurophysiology has pointed<br>to the tremendous importance of these<br>early years studies of animal behavior<br>where<br>variations in the norm what would be<br>considered the normal environment of the<br>young species have been introduced have<br>shown that during the early years the<br>young organism is more susceptible to<br>the influence of experience studies from<br>a field of education and from the area<br>of the influences of the environment on<br>intelligence have all pointed to the<br>greater malleability of the organism the<br>greater responsibility to experience and<br>the greater need for stimulation during<br>this period so I've called it the<br>inevitable hypothesis that this is<br>really the a and absolutely the critical<br>period for the development of human<br>beings the view that children ought to<br>be spending 24 hours a day being cared<br>for by their mothers is still widely<br>held yet the reality of the situation is<br>different in 1975 in New Zealand there<br>were 35,000 to 40,000 mothers of<br>preschool children in part or full-time<br>employment people just sort of denied<br>that infants were ever in childcare and<br>secondly closed our eyes today the<br>challenge created when we think about<br>what experiences should be arranged for<br>children during that period and that's<br>really how I got into the field and I<br>entered it at a time in history when the<br>world was just discovering childcare<br>when women were going to work in<br>increasing numbers when many societies<br>were realizing that women had to work<br>from the standpoint of the economy of<br>those societies quite apart from the<br>women's legitimate needs and rights to<br>express their own talents so it's been a<br>very exciting time in history to be<br>mrs. Pat Hubbard director of the Dunedin<br>Community child care center has found<br>that a very wide range of different<br>sorts of families have a need for child<br>care we have at any one time between a<br>third and a half of the children from<br>solo parent families but even amongst<br>that group there are lots of differences<br>some of the mothers are working because<br>they need to work to earn enough money<br>some of them are students we've got one<br>mother who's an adult student who's gone<br>back to high school who's just finished<br>doing university entrance exams and then<br>we have one or two solo parent families<br>where the mother is bringing the child<br>of a center in order to get a break<br>she's not actually working but it's to<br>get a break from the 24-hour job a day<br>job of looking after a preschool child<br>then amongst the two-parent families<br>there are once again a wide range of<br>different needs one parents working once<br>a student or both the parents have<br>chosen to work perhaps at this<br>particular period there's just lots of<br>different reasons why to what my<br>children need to be in the center the<br>fear that childcare cannot be an<br>adequate substitute for a mother's care<br>has led to some strong opposition to<br>childcare John Bowlby stated for example<br>that it is essential for mental health<br>the children not be separated from their<br>mothers in the first three years of life<br>Bowlby thought that institutional care<br>for young children could have a<br>profoundly detrimental effect on<br>children the research on which that<br>premise that generalization was based<br>was done with children in institutions<br>that were vastly different from the<br>ordinary childcare situation often they<br>were institutions for children awaiting<br>adoption or they were in institutions<br>where children have been placed because<br>of severe illness either that the<br>children had or that their parents had<br>and thus necessitated separation<br>prolonged hospitalization<br>someone know where I think we made an<br>error in generalizing from studies of<br>that sort was when we assumed that any<br>short-term separation followed by a<br>reunion every day was psychologically<br>equivalent to those long-term<br>separations where the child might be<br>very ill where there some in some<br>instances that children didn't know who<br>they were they didn't have a family and<br>they were awaiting adoption or where the<br>number of people available as as<br>qualified substitutes was so small that<br>the children experienced prolonged and<br>severe deprivation now you know um for<br>centuries well to do people have<br>separated from their children and have<br>managed and the children managed to grow<br>up reasonably well-adjusted<br>let's take their British tradition of<br>the use of the nanny in many situations<br>these children had limited contact<br>during the early years with their own<br>mothers now I'm talking about in a<br>historical period an earlier period and<br>yet no one seemed to worry that that<br>kind of separation would weaken the<br>child's attachment to the mother if you<br>go back historically a little more<br>children where sometimes turned over<br>totally to a wet nurse for feeding for<br>long periods would later be returned to<br>the family it's very interesting that we<br>really began to be concerned about this<br>separation only when what you might call<br>middle-class women or women who were<br>less well educated and less affluent<br>began to to find some kind of assistance<br>in their childcare and then suddenly we<br>became very worried about it I find that<br>an interesting historical quirk<br>most children develop strong attachments<br>to their parents particularly their<br>mothers they seem to use the feeling of<br>security they gain from these<br>attachments as a base from which to<br>explore the world around them can<br>children who have been in childcare from<br>an early age develop attachments for<br>their mothers we looked at the<br>attachment of the children to their own<br>mothers a group of children who had been<br>in childcare from around 1 year of age<br>and then we did this study when the<br>children were two and a half years of<br>age and we had a control group of<br>children from comparable economic social<br>backgrounds who had been reared at home<br>by their own mothers and we found that<br>the children in both groups appeared<br>equally attached to their primary<br>caregivers that is to their mothers<br>there were some kind of interesting<br>slight differences their best summary of<br>that study was that we found no<br>significant differences of any magnitude<br>at all but one slight difference that we<br>found was that the children who had been<br>in childcare<br>I had broader attachments that is the<br>primary attachment to the mother was<br>there and was secure however they also<br>were able to become attached to a larger<br>number of people than was true for the<br>infants who had been reared exclusively<br>by their own mothers we also looked in<br>that study and at an important variant<br>of attachment and namely the attachment<br>of the mothers to the children you know<br>if childcare weakens the attachment of a<br>mother for her child that may be more<br>damaging in the long run than the<br>weakening of the child's attachment to<br>the mother because of the implications<br>of this kind of weakened attachment and<br>we didn't find that that was the case<br>the mothers of the children in daycare<br>were just as attached to their own<br>children as were the mothers in homes<br>dr. Cole was research them shows that<br>child care does not necessarily result<br>in psychological damage to children<br>indeed there is evidence that really<br>good childcare can produce a number of<br>beneficial effects Pat Hubbard and many<br>others in child care in New Zealand are<br>very concerned that licensing in this<br>country does not provide the kind of<br>quality control that is essential the<br>other thing have a major area of concern<br>I have is that the regulations don't<br>build in anything about the sort of<br>activities or the sort of equipment that<br>is needed so that although we say that<br>childcare is an educational enterprise<br>it really doesn't have to be according<br>to the way the regulations are set up<br>because you don't need to have for<br>instance a set of unit blocks you don't<br>need to have clay provided you don't<br>need to offer painting on a regular<br>basis none of those sorts of activities<br>which would be accepted as necessary in<br>any sort of preschool situation are<br>actually required by the regulations and<br>unfortunately if you don't require<br>things lots of people don't feel it's<br>necessary to offer them especially the<br>Messier things and the more expensive<br>things because it's very expensive to<br>run those sorts of activities<br>dr. Caldwell is concerned at what<br>constitutes a good quality childcare<br>environment their most important<br>ingredient will be the people and this<br>is true in any society and any kind of<br>childcare you must have people who<br>understand children who understand what<br>children need and how to meet those<br>needs you must have people who are warm<br>and loving who enjoy talking to children<br>you don't feel silly doing the things<br>that little children enjoy doing because<br>children love to have an adult<br>participate in their play in their games<br>and in their formal learning activities<br>so the interpersonal factors for me<br>clearly the most important you also have<br>to be concerned about the physical<br>environment I mean not only they rooms<br>the large space that's available but the<br>equipment that you make available for<br>children in some of the research that my<br>colleagues and I have done we have shown<br>that the availability of teaching<br>learning materials to children is<br>something that's quite important in<br>terms of how the children willis will<br>develop so you must make materials<br>available that children can act upon not<br>that they can just look at things that<br>will facilitate small muscle activities<br>large muscle activities materials that<br>will help them have contact comfort and<br>and feelings of warmth if you will and<br>then I think another ingredient that's<br>important in good childcare that people<br>don't talk about a great deal is how<br>time is used in fact I usually refer to<br>these three components that I'm talking<br>about as interpersonal physical and<br>temporal factors I think it's not too<br>difficult to set up a good kindergarten<br>or play center that operates two hours a<br>day but if you have children for the<br>length of time that their mothers work<br>say from a quarter of eight to maybe<br>four fifteen or some such time as that<br>you have to be very clever in how you<br>arrange periods of time during the day<br>in order to keep the children from<br>becoming overtired or bored<br>or listless or even aggressive and so I<br>think the way that time is used<br>scheduling some vigorous activities and<br>quiet activities scheduling some that<br>the teachers initiate and entice the<br>children in and others in which the<br>children are permitted to select quite<br>freely from the materials available<br>those are the three things that I think<br>if you can put them together in the<br>proper proportions will lead to quality<br>child care the Dunedin community child<br>care scheme who started as an<br>International Women's here project it<br>was an attempt to show that it was<br>possible to provide really good<br>substitute care for children on an<br>mrs. Hobart thinks there are several<br>things that are special and important<br>about the center well we think there are<br>a number of things that are special<br>about it I think probably the most<br>important one is the question of staff<br>again that we have insisted from the<br>beginning on having a high ratio of<br>adults to children and we do this partly<br>by having a lot of paid staff we<br>actually have two full-time staff and<br>four part-time staff all paid not paid a<br>great deal but paid more than some<br>people in childcare and that's for a<br>group of children that would fluctuate<br>between 20 and 25 so that we usually<br>have as many as four paid adults on the<br>spot at any one time and one or two<br>volunteers as well and the volunteers<br>were the staff enable us to do a number<br>of really interesting things like taking<br>children out in small groups like<br>working with children on a one-to-one<br>basis where that seems to be indicated<br>and the trips I think really make you<br>know make one of the biggest differences<br>to our centre the fact that we do take<br>children away from the centre that we<br>don't feel and they don't feel that they<br>were all shut up here all day together<br>because sometimes that could be very<br>wearing many people do not understand<br>the necessity of involving parents in<br>childcare centres to involve a parent in<br>every way possible is one of the most<br>meaningful things that can be done<br>to ensure quality care it's difficult to<br>do but it's well worth the effort and<br>it's essential for a quality program I<br>think that many women who do not work<br>and many men who do work do not fully<br>appreciate the difficulties and the real<br>burdens to sound dramatic that a working<br>woman who is concerned about her<br>children and family can experience<br>sometimes childcare centers aren't as<br>sensitive to that as they ought to be<br>they want the mothers and the fathers to<br>come in whenever there is any kind of<br>meeting want them to be able to come and<br>help sometimes in the program and yet<br>this can be extremely difficult for a<br>working mother so I think we have to be<br>quite understanding and sympathetic and<br>appreciative of the tremendous task that<br>most mothers who work and care about<br>their children do carry on we feel that<br>parents are terribly important not only<br>to their children but to the center and<br>we have tried to build up within the<br>center the feeling that this is a an<br>extended family situation that it's<br>really a community group and that<br>parents are always welcome here at<br>anytime and cries wash them actually use<br>that freedom to come and go they come in<br>and have lunch with us they pop in for a<br>cup of tea they come in if they're<br>feeling miserable and depressed and they<br>hate what they ought to be doing they<br>come in to share the happy celebration<br>times with us and we had the most<br>marvelous birthday parties and things<br>like that both for children and for<br>adults so that parties are a big feature<br>of life in the center and if you've got<br>something like 36 children and lots and<br>lots of adults associated with the<br>center it's almost always somebody's<br>birthday so we have chocolate cake for<br>afternoon tea or lunch just about this<br>once a week and often several times in a<br>week if we're to provide good quality<br>childcare in New Zealand the problem is<br>of how is it to be financed the bare<br>essentials of a decent childcare program<br>can bring many centers close to closing<br>down and there is very little public<br>financial support for childcare in New<br>Zealand yes I think that every country<br>has the same problem you understand<br>everyone wants childcare<br>no one's willing to pay for it but you<br>have to pay for anything that is a<br>quality service now I think that some of<br>the money should come from the parents<br>and some of the money should come from<br>the industries that are served by having<br>available about a group of workers but<br>certainly regular it should come from<br>the government and in that context I<br>always compare it to education we<br>believe in education and it never occurs<br>to any developed nation to be unwilling<br>to pay for education but not everyone<br>yet believes in the importance of those<br>early experiences that you asked me<br>about earlier in this interview and<br>therefore people seem unwilling to pay<br>for quality programs that reach the very<br>young child and yet I don't think we<br>will ever have quality unless the state<br>and federal governments play a major<br>role in financing it I don't know of<br>anybody who really makes money out of<br>looking after children that's an<br>accusation you often hear levelled at<br>the private daycare operator in the<br>United States but if you ever examine<br>salaries that these people make they're<br>very low so no one makes a lot of money<br>out of daycare and there's only one way<br>to for a proprietor let's say to make<br>money and that would be to pay the staff<br>an inhuman wage if you will and<br>hopefully this is simply not allowed I<br>am concerned about wages and day care<br>however I think they're too low<br>everywhere and I think that they the<br>people who are concerned about child<br>care and having quote cheap childcare<br>available are not really people who are<br>concerned about children so in one way<br>you can have child care available<br>cheaply and that's not to pay the people<br>who do the work a living wage and if you<br>don't pay people a living wage you can't<br>well we've sort of avoided talking about<br>money up till now but money really is at<br>the background of a lot of the problems<br>at the moment basically childcare is<br>financed out of parents fees the only<br>government assistance is through the<br>Social Welfare Department and they pay a<br>small subsidy it is actually in process<br>of going up at the beginning of next<br>year so it will be a bit more but even<br>then it barely is keeping up with them<br>sort of increase in costs they pay the<br>small subsidy for children from families<br>of low incomes who can't afford the full<br>cost of childcare but that really makes<br>it very hard to finance an operation<br>because even if you have a proportion of<br>families who can pay the full cost and<br>the families here who you know have a<br>substantial income do pay the full cost<br>of what it what it costs to keep a child<br>in our centre which is 25 dollars a week<br>there's a for many of the families<br>there's a very big gap between what they<br>can afford to pay and we accept families<br>on the basis of what they can afford to<br>pay and the subsidy that Social Welfare<br>gives us so there's a lot of money to be<br>made up and we spend a great deal of<br>time applying to trusts and foundations<br>than anybody else we can think of to get<br>money but that's really no way to run to<br>run what amounts to a small business<br>operation you know sort of begging for<br>money here there and everywhere we feel<br>that we are running an educational<br>service for children who would otherwise<br>go to play centre or kindergarten but<br>aren't able to use those services and<br>that we ought to be able to get those<br>salary support and subsidies on<br>equipment and so on the same way that<br>they do but the education department<br>insists that it doesn't have money to<br>help child care at this stage and that<br>it's a policy decision that every<br>conference that any of us have ever been<br>to about early education says that<br>childcare ought to be getting money from<br>the Education Department so we live in<br>some Maori books all right should I call<br>that the Maori boys are you gonna go<br>round up<br>in some childcare establishments like<br>the Dunedin Center there are<br>compensations for the low salary the<br>staff enjoy their work I think the<br>adults work very much as a team here and<br>I think one of the things that has<br>happened I don't think it's something<br>you could plan is that the adult group<br>is really very happy working here as a<br>group and I think that contributes to<br>the center too it's really a lovely<br>place to arrive at to work everybody<br>rush children rush out to greet you and<br>I think this contributes to the<br>atmosphere of a place that it's really a<br>very welcoming place to come to and to<br>be in and to spend time here and I think<br>that probably makes a difference to how<br>the children feel about it too because<br>the majority for children really enjoy<br>coming I'm not saying we don't have<br>settling in problems with children of<br>course we do but the children who have<br>been here for a while really love coming<br>it's part of their life in a very<br>settled and enjoyable way I think we<br>have established them that early<br>learning is the foundation on which<br>later development is based that there is<br>a need for substitute childcare in New<br>Zealand the childcare is not the same as<br>long term residential<br>institutionalization and that quality<br>childcare is not psychologically<br>damaging some of the components of<br>quality childcare are a good ratio of<br>trained and competent staff to children<br>an appropriate physical environment<br>provision of a variety of different<br>activities according to child's needs<br>and parent involvement in order to<br>ensure that thousands of New Zealand<br>children do not suffer from inadequate<br>substitute childcare it is necessary<br>first to produce a revised set of<br>regulations and secondly to provide<br>increased public financial support<br>supplied according to the economic needs<br>of the family we simply can't afford to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
