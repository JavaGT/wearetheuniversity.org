Smith, Emeritus Professor of Education and Childhood Studies, FRSNZ, CNZM.<br><br>This film, featuring Helen May, Anne Stonehouse, Anne Meade, Lillian Katz, explores the elements of quality early childhood education and care.<br><br>These films were very influential and widely used for kindergarten and childcare training at the time, and went on to be used in teacher education in colleges of education and in various education studies and women's studies programmes in universities.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated

are<br>important too but young children are<br>especially vulnerable to bad<br>environments and open to the positive<br>effects of good ones most parents want a<br>happy stimulating environment for their<br>children and want to make an informed<br>choice about their young child's care<br>and education families differ in the<br>amount of time their child attends a<br>center but choosing quality is important<br>most particularly when children are in<br>longer day centers sometimes such<br>choices are simply not available and in<br>these days of deregulation and<br>cost-cutting even government-funded<br>services cannot always be assumed to be<br>of good quality in this film we want to<br>look at some positive features for child<br>development in early childhood centers<br>and to suggest some things that parents<br>can look for to provide their child with<br>the best possible early childhood<br>early childhood ed you care is a<br>collective name for programs for young<br>children which incorporate both care and<br>education we want to use that label in<br>this film because it's especially<br>suitable for our integrated services in<br>New Zealand and because it removes a lot<br>of unhelpful distinctions such as the<br>old one between childcare and preschool<br>education it is also valuable because it<br>suggests that for young children it's<br>impossible to separate care and<br>education a caring and nurturing<br>environment is usually the best<br>environment in which a small child can<br>learn because it's also both stimulating<br>and responsive many early childhood<br>educators agree about the nature of good<br>quality early childhood educator we have<br>adult-child interactions adult child<br>ratios trained staff stability of staff<br>group size planned programs or<br>sensitivity to family and culture<br>biculturalism safe and healthy physical<br>environment cost linked to quality by<br>far the most important aspect of good<br>quality is the nature of the<br>interactions and the relationships<br>between adults and children vygotsky's<br>work suggests that children's thinking<br>emerges out of social interactions with<br>sensitive social partners it's a fallacy<br>to think that learning and education can<br>only occur when an adult has an<br>authoritarian formal role<br>and teaches academic content most<br>psychologists today agree that<br>children's intellectual achievements<br>happen in the context of their talk and<br>adult-child interactions should combine<br>warmth affection nurturance<br>and sensitivity with firm demands backed<br>up by reasoning adults need to know the<br>child and family well to provide such<br>interactions most of the other elements<br>of quality also influence adult-child<br>interactions in the center to me there's<br>sort of an intuitive gut feeling which<br>probably is the strongest thing and it's<br>to do with emotional relationships and I<br>suppose if if I if I'm in that role as a<br>parent which I've been a number of times<br>I'm looking for an emotional<br>relationship responsive relationships<br>physical touching sort of almost what<br>you might call love and children's eyes<br>and love and staff eyes for each other<br>and let that's that to me is the<br>fundamental thing because unless that<br>emotional relationship is there I don't<br>think any of the other things in terms<br>of empowering children to learn and grow<br>or anything it's going to happen the<br>most important thing to me about quality<br>for babies and toddlers is the quality<br>of the interactions between the between<br>adults and children and so you want a<br>lot of warmth and caring but you also<br>want people who understand what very<br>young children are on about what they're<br>interested in doing understand and are<br>excited by their development I know<br>quite a few people who think it would be<br>very boring to work with babies and<br>toddlers because they don't do anything<br>they can't even talk so you need people<br>who are very excited about babbles and<br>coos and<br>and little little developmental<br>milestones and then the other thing I<br>think of is a rich and interesting<br>environment with lots of opportunities<br>for babies and toddlers to to do what<br>they're able to do what they're enjoying<br>what they enjoy doing and for them to<br>use the skills that they have without<br>being totally reliant on adults to give<br>them things to do or play with them or<br>show them how to play I like the idea of<br>a rich environment with lots of things<br>for children to choose and adults are<br>there to help and support and and give<br>cuddles and talk and be available when<br>they need it while spending time with<br>the children so that you can see that<br>the the adults are actually enjoying<br>being with the children and that they're<br>not spending too much time either doing<br>physical housekeeping type things in the<br>center or too much time spent out or to<br>add on yes it's important that the<br>adults talk to each other and share with<br>the children are up to and what to plan<br>next but I've seen in quite a number of<br>centers the tendency for adults to<br>cluster together and not get in there<br>and talk and extend and enjoy what the<br>children are doing the extent to which<br>the adults are engaged in interacting<br>with the children and certainly the<br>kinds of interactions are they largely I<br>mean what's the content of their<br>interaction is it about what the<br>children are learning about thinking<br>about the the conflicts they're trying<br>to resolve and so on rather than just<br>sort of watering them around or<br>reminding them to be quiet or still and<br>so on so the content of the adult child<br>interaction is very important and adults<br>should be engaged in interacting with<br>small groups of children and individual<br>children and some whole group experience<br>as well research shows that it's<br>impossible for adults to have positive<br>and growth-promoting interactions with<br>children and families if there are not<br>enough adults available to interact with<br>children especially for under<br>two-year-olds and in all day Educare<br>ratios of adults to children should be<br>no more than three children to every<br>adult for over two year-olds in all day<br>Educare optimal ratio should be about<br>one adult to every six children and<br>certainly no more than one to eight four<br>children in part day Educare center's<br>ratio should preferably be one adult to<br>ten children and certainly no more than<br>fifteen so that one of the sort of<br>top-down indices of quality is the child<br>adult ratio I must say that's one of<br>things that worries me a bit about the<br>kindergartens here because you're a very<br>large group forty children and two<br>adults it's hard to get really good<br>quality interaction between adults and<br>research has demonstrated the children's<br>development in early childhood centers<br>is enhanced if there are trained staff<br>working with them trained staff tend to<br>provide more social interaction more<br>stimulation to children's language and<br>thinking and they're better able to plan<br>programs to fit the individual needs of<br>the group of children they're working in<br>many people assume that any caring<br>person can look after young children but<br>and Stonehouse points out how important<br>trained staff are even for very young<br>children I think quite obviously people<br>need education and training going back<br>to what I said before they need<br>education to not only to know what those<br>important developmental milestones are<br>but to to know what they mean to know<br>for example that being able to transfer<br>an object from one hand to the other<br>that's a very small thing and a lot of<br>people would overlook it but in terms of<br>what it allows a baby to do with with<br>objects around her it's it's a very<br>important developmental milestone and I<br>mean I'm sure until I was trained I<br>would have overlooked something like<br>that the other thing is that I don't I<br>don't think that working well with<br>babies and toddlers is any less<br>sophisticated or less challenging less<br>complex than working well with older<br>children and and there are lots of<br>practices to be learned lots of ideas to<br>I think that is a widely held it's a<br>sort of common sense notion that anyone<br>can take care of young children wants to<br>and anyone does in fact but there's<br>quite at first of all there's a big<br>difference when you're taking care of<br>your own children<br>and other people's children and<br>especially in larger groups if they're<br>your own children you have had lots of<br>experience with each other so you can<br>read each other fairly well ideally know<br>what each child means and so on but for<br>other people's children you need very<br>strong observational skills in order to<br>make the right imprints is about where<br>child means and how each other feels and<br>so on and to know how to plan for a<br>group of children who are not your own<br>not the children you live with all the<br>time I think it takes training and<br>practice and guided practice so someone<br>can help you interpret your experiences<br>with the children and meet suggests that<br>parents should find out about stuff when<br>choosing a center go to the centre go on<br>and get some sort of sense of the<br>organizational culture of the center and<br>then start asking some questions and ask<br>some questions about staffing how many<br>staff there are for the children why<br>they got those sort of staffing patterns<br>what are the qualifications of the staff<br>what are the experiences of the staff<br>and take a look at the Charter that will<br>give you a sense what are the really<br>important goals that previous parents<br>staff management committee have worked<br>out and that will give parents a sense<br>of<br>what they want for children the people<br>are already in that center centers where<br>there is a relatively stable and<br>consistent group of adults working with<br>the children provide a better quality of<br>Educare children cannot develop close<br>relationships with the adults who are<br>working with them if these adults are<br>constantly changing there is a limit to<br>the number of ties that children<br>especially infants can form the<br>departure of known staff can confuse and<br>distress children and they must begin<br>again the slow process of investing in a<br>new emotional relationship staff<br>stability is usually strongly related to<br>the type of pay and working conditions<br>offered in early childhood centers you<br>want to ask about the stability of the<br>staff is it if it's a staff that turns<br>over I don't know if you use that term<br>but where they're constantly changing<br>it's an index that there might be staff<br>morale problems and children are very<br>sensitive to adult moods and should not<br>be in environments of hostility and<br>conflict all day which might happen does<br>happen highly emotionally charged<br>research has shown that group size has a<br>surprisingly strong influence on the<br>quality of early childhood educator<br>being in a small group provides a warmer<br>and more human atmosphere for small<br>children because they have a limited<br>capacity to form a large number of<br>relationships more intense conversations<br>into interactions between adult and<br>child and between children happen in<br>smaller groups and children are less<br>likely to be distressed people don't<br>have to be regimented and they can<br>function as individuals groups of 10 or<br>less are preferable for infants and<br>toddlers for three-year-olds and over<br>groups of no more than 15 are preferable<br>and certainly no more than 25 it's<br>possible to have a large center which is<br>subdivided into smaller groups but these<br>should be relatively distinct there is<br>no one right curriculum for early<br>childhood educator but it's important<br>that centers do have a program an idea<br>of what their objectives are and a<br>philosophy underlying those objectives<br>in New Zealand having a look at the<br>center charter will give you an idea of<br>the approach taken by the center but<br>it's important to observe the program in<br>action centers should not merely provide<br>custodial childminding facilities<br>without thought for how children learn<br>and grow children do not need formal<br>highly structured programs in order to<br>learn attention needs to be given to<br>children's social and emotional<br>development as well as to their academic<br>development indeed research suggests<br>that it is through conversations over<br>shared activities that children's<br>development is extended<br>I think it it's at its broadest level<br>that it's really important for a group<br>of people who are working together with<br>babies and toddlers to think about the<br>the values that they're trying to<br>support the characteristics that they're<br>trying to nurture for example are they<br>offering the sort of program that<br>encourages babies and toddlers to become<br>cooperative or to become competitive<br>it's not as simple as that but but<br>people need to think about that and to<br>work out work out their differences so<br>that in that big sense of what is it<br>we're aiming to do with children or what<br>sort of adults would we want to help to<br>help these children to become I think<br>that's important but to do a good job<br>with babies and toddlers you need you<br>need to have an idea of what you're<br>going to do and then be prepared to drop<br>it I mean that's what I always say to<br>students is that yes it's important to<br>have that plan but to know that<br>sometimes some very good days may happen<br>when you haven't done anything that was<br>in that plan but it's a starting point a<br>basis to work from I'm talking about<br>adults its curriculum it's responsive<br>playthings I'm talking about the<br>environment as curriculum that the<br>environment is an interesting place for<br>an infant to learn and explore I think<br>we're more familiar and early childhood<br>with the concept of players curriculum<br>but what is the role of the adult in<br>that play I think it's those kinds of<br>things and the other area if I'm talking<br>about instances one which is probably<br>not addressed quite so frequently is<br>with other children is quite formative<br>and so it's really the relationships in<br>which the infant is and the environment<br>a lot of people get confused between<br>academic activities making formal<br>instruction<br>basic skills like that's not really<br>and over strengthen encouraged<br>interaction is functional cooperating<br>about you do work to help children to<br>explore something endearing that is<br>worth learning sort of if you like<br>explore they might certainly a lot in<br>the natural children in modern countries<br>like ours especially in the urban areas<br>really don't know where things come<br>they're surrounded by magic remote<br>control they don't know how bread got<br>made or even where the milk comes from<br>anymore unless they're still growing in<br>very rural areas but even in rural areas<br>these things are highly mechanized so<br>that the school then has the early<br>school experience has a responsibility<br>to get a deeper one very positive aspect<br>of young children in early childhood<br>centers is the opportunity to learn from<br>and develop relationships with peers<br>even very young children can benefit<br>from such friendships with peers either<br>the same age older or younger there are<br>benefits from being with same age and<br>different age children getting to know<br>your peers is a process which usually<br>needs careful guidance from adults<br>especially for under three-year-olds if<br>young children's relationships with each<br>other are not carefully guided by adults<br>aggressive or disruptive behavior can<br>develop positive relationships develop<br>best when the group of children is<br>relatively stable it's near impossible<br>to provide quality education casual care<br>situations where a different group of<br>children who don't know each other well<br>a group together children gain emotional<br>support from familiar peers and it's<br>stressful for them to be placed in a<br>constantly changing group children can<br>also help each other to develop their<br>we there's a fairly large body of<br>research now that that supports what<br>practitioners have known for a long time<br>and that is that that very young<br>children even babies under a year old<br>formed friendships they enjoy each other<br>they may not have as many skills as<br>older children and relating to each<br>other but but other children are in<br>foreign or an important part of their<br>lives I don't I don't support the idea<br>that parents need to actively seek out<br>large numbers of large groups for their<br>babies to go to I don't think babies<br>need lots of other people but but they<br>can certainly benefit from having some<br>other people including other people<br>their own age to be around and and<br>certainly the opportunity for very young<br>children to be with slightly older<br>children is a real plus for for both for<br>both the older children and the younger<br>children for many children the center or<br>the kindergarten will be the first place<br>where learning to build satisfying<br>relationships with children outside the<br>family occur and the evidence is very<br>convincing that this the kinds of skills<br>that are required for satisfying<br>relationships with peers honor and very<br>early and if they are not there are<br>long-term consequences it early<br>childhood educators have traditionally<br>been interested in social development I<br>think now the evidence backs this up as<br>high priority because the consequences<br>are enormous forever as it were because<br>once you've established a sort of social<br>reputation among peers even if you're<br>only four there is a tendency for that<br>reputation to stay and to be reinforced<br>quality early childhood centers welcome<br>families from all cultural groups make<br>an effort to meet their needs and keep<br>open channels of communication there<br>needs to be visible evidence in the<br>physical environment and in interactions<br>with children that staff value and<br>respect the culture of the children<br>parents are most comfortable in a more<br>relaxed atmosphere where the adults<br>don't behave like experts and talk down<br>to them parents should have access to<br>centers at all times and should be able<br>to know and if possible share in<br>decision making at the center if the<br>parents are able to be involved in the<br>daily program this is an a special bonus<br>for small children their parents or<br>farno are usually the most important<br>people in the world so it's important<br>that they have good relationships with<br>the caregivers who work with them during<br>the day parents also know their child<br>best so teachers can learn lots about<br>the child from them because of the<br>introduction the way that a new family<br>is introduced into the corner with the<br>far know the greeting and caring for the<br>children taking in the children and<br>become part of the father as soon as<br>that happens the Ferno concepts take<br>place and that you know that your child<br>is part of that final child and that I<br>finally and that<br>certain things will happen the spiritual<br>part is very important and I'm not<br>talking about religion I'm talking about<br>a feeling the the the manner of a child<br>the the loading the specialness of a<br>child where the child has accepted for<br>what he or she is and the nurturing of<br>it<br>by the self-esteem I suppose it's the<br>obviously the younger the children are<br>the more parent staff interaction there<br>needs to be and there usually is because<br>it's very difficult for let's say a<br>kindergarten teacher to interpret a<br>child without input from the parent the<br>parent is the one who's like to say well<br>some of this child my child means this<br>when he says that and that's part of<br>being a young child so that you you want<br>close cooperation with parents and to<br>have their confidence and to have their<br>information that only they have if<br>you're working with a group quite<br>obviously you're working with other<br>people's children people who who have<br>different values who have different<br>family compositions who have different<br>cultural backgrounds different language<br>backgrounds and so you have a<br>responsibility to not ignore those<br>differences to not deny those<br>differences to not belittle those<br>differences and you also have that<br>important responsibility to form a<br>in New Zealand it's particularly<br>important for us to offer programs which<br>are bicultural for all children programs<br>which respect and support two comer and<br>Tyrell of the Maori as well as the<br>values of European culture<br>this is an acknowledgement of the Maori<br>people as tongue at a fen aware of New<br>Zealand and the partnership implied in<br>honoring the Treaty of Waitangi most<br>centers have little difficulty in<br>incorporating European culture in their<br>programs but a real test of equality<br>centre is whether they incorporate<br>aspects of Maori culture and language in<br>their programs<br>Marty children are already bicultural<br>and that's the issue<br>the Tony your packet children we would<br>like to be by country and by cultural<br>isn't a word that should be that is<br>threatening it shouldn't be seen as real<br>that's something where you can share<br>knowledge to give them and it's a better<br>for Maori and Pacific island families<br>it's not just a question of having their<br>culture valued and respected but a<br>question of preservation of language and<br>culture with the help of their child's<br>early childhood center lane which is the<br>most exciting thing because in the<br>language I hold those concepts and for<br>me and I'm doing a study on my own child<br>I've seen her as as being active and<br>driving our learning she our two young<br>children have changed our whole<br>household we speak Marti most of the<br>time now and all of us my two older<br>children my husband is a modern English<br>teacher and myself I've learned all my<br>Marty from my children my two preschools<br>and the capacity to hold the language<br>has never ceased to amaze me the<br>capacity to learn songs and to be able<br>to use phrases from these songs for the<br>only<br>good quality early childhood centers<br>need also to have a safe comfortable and<br>interesting physical environment this<br>doesn't have to be in an expensive<br>building a good Early Childhood Center<br>has many of the physical features of a<br>home there should be a degree of order<br>without sterility with the type of space<br>which allows people to interact together<br>over common activities I think the first<br>thing anybody would start with is that<br>it needs to be a reasonably safe and<br>healthy environment<br>I say reasonably because I think<br>sometimes is a bit of a tension between<br>making and and interesting and rich in<br>an exciting environment and making it a<br>totally safe environment so you've got<br>to got to let children get dirty and<br>messy and let them take risk privacy is<br>also important for children are there<br>places in the environment where children<br>can withdraw so they don't have to<br>interact all day sometimes it's hard for<br>young children to be involved and<br>responsive to others all day long they<br>should be able to pull away in quiet<br>corners where they could read or<br>whatever I'm sure there's a long list of<br>others but those are very easy to sort<br>for most parents a critical feature of<br>choosing a good center is going to be<br>cost while some early childhood centers<br>for over three year-olds are virtually<br>free and other centers are operated by<br>parents cooperatively through voluntary<br>labor at most centers which offer longer<br>hours or provide for under<br>three-year-olds considerable cost to<br>parents will be involved the most<br>important aspect of quality is the human<br>element mainly competent trained and<br>skilled staff meet suggests that in<br>looking at the cost of early childhood<br>educator it's essential to see what<br>contributes to the cost of care take a<br>look at how the how the money seems to<br>be spent maybe ask some questions about<br>whether the money is being spent on all<br>the things to do with really good<br>interactions between children and the<br>NRC if you're just looking for visible<br>science effect that a center has in a<br>nice new building with lots of glossy<br>equipment can be bit misleading so you<br>need to watch out for things that are<br>rather less obvious ways of spending<br>money but just find out about whether as<br>money is spent on through the staff<br>training where the money is spent to<br>make sure the ratio of else to children<br>that's good whether money is spent on<br>making staff feel valued so that they<br>want to stay and that they're going to<br>stay with your child if it were to be<br>enrolled there from - right through to<br>five your child wants to have a<br>relationship with those people right<br>through<br>a constant turnover awesome and I think<br>even now what we say as a reasonable<br>wage for an early childhood worker is<br>viewed as a pessimist by the rest of the<br>community we're still very you know down<br>the very low end but if you start<br>looking at that fabric in terms of staff<br>well-being and some of the things that I<br>see in that in terms of its the centers<br>that have the stable staff that pay<br>reasonable conditions there that seems<br>to have the fundamental foundation for<br>other elements of quality which we see<br>in terms of the learning and development<br>of children to be based upon unless<br>you've got those quality staff because<br>if you look at curriculum for early<br>childhood adults are in a sense what I<br>would see is the main curriculum they<br>are the most for infants they're the<br>most responsive plaything and so much of<br>the curriculum depends on their adult<br>child relationship and so unless the<br>staff whether they're voluntary whether<br>they're paid unless their well-being is<br>cared for you know nothing else seems<br>drop right we have suggested some things<br>for parents to look for when choosing an<br>early childhood center for their child<br>parents also have their own ideas about<br>what's important which will help them<br>make a choice the first and most<br>important thing for any parent to do<br>when choosing a center is to visit talk<br>to the staff and spend some time<br>watching what goes on talking to other<br>parents is also helpful there are some<br>public documents which parents can ask<br>to see<br>one is the center's Charter which is a<br>statement of their particular goals and<br>objectives the other is the report of<br>the educational review office which<br>comes from an annual visit ero reports<br>on how well the center is meeting the<br>commitments it has made under its<br>Charter most families at some time or<br>other need to seek support in their role<br>of bringing up their children however<br>the value of quality Educare is not just<br>a private good for individual children<br>and families societies need to develop<br>quality early childhood educator and<br>value the people who provide it because<br>it's an investment in a healthy adult<br>population a public good we believe that<br>it's a shared responsibility for parents<br>and governments to work towards the best<br>quality education for governments to<br>provide substantial subsidies so that<br>children from the lowest to the highest<br>income levels can benefit and for<br>governments to monitor the quality of<br>centers so that low quality care is not<br>permitted parents and early
