Smith, Emeritus Professor of Education and Childhood Studies, FRSNZ, CNZM.<br><br>This film highlights the role of Home Based Day Care in support of families and children (in a programme that also included before and after school care) and advocates for further funding.<br><br>These films were very influential and widely used for kindergarten and childcare training at the time, and went on to be used in teacher education in colleges of education and in various education studies and women's studies programmes in universities.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

good<br>yes but stabilize me and the children I<br>find that because it's the nature of my<br>job I need an arrangement whereby I can<br>go to work and feel confident that my<br>child is being cheerful adequately I've<br>tried it Ranger in the past and I<br>haven't been worked and I found that<br>from arrangement which I have now would<br>be so need a deflection and the sense<br>that I feel confident about the people<br>looking after my child in the pathways<br>you know obtained terror through<br>advertising and painting things so forth<br>and although we try our hardest to<br>interview them and try to gauge what<br>sort of people they are<br>it was never you know I never really<br>felt confident that the person I leave<br>my child with what was the right person<br>I suppose in a family daycare they do<br>screen the people and we get a second<br>look at them so you know they've had to<br>bridges to cross as opposed to just one<br>and the first bridge of course um<br>through the daycare center I had to pass<br>through a more experienced<br>well I have three hours a week purely as<br>a break for me and for the children I<br>have four children the oldest five and<br>then I have twins nearly four and<br>another one two and a half and they come<br>here and they enjoy it tremendously they<br>love it and like a home and perhaps I<br>have a reason for doing my house which I<br>can't do otherwise has that made a<br>difference to you the way you feel it's<br>made a tremendous difference yes we all<br>look forward to our mornings and as I<br>say it's just what's needed I feel great<br>about the children enjoy it too<br>yes very much they really look forward<br>to coming and doing their things and yes<br>Julie could you tell us what your<br>involvement with the Family Day kiss<br>game is yes I'm Akira and I care for a<br>number of children and my own home why<br>did you get involved with this project<br>well I think it started when my youngest<br>daughter was three and I went to the<br>center for some company and to get hurt<br>playing with other children and<br>everything in sort of built up from<br>there and then Jason came when he was at<br>11 months old and he goes to school<br>beginning the year and I've had babies<br>I've had a baby to give mother break<br>solemn um I've got a 15 year old little<br>boy who have had since he's three months<br>old and he's has mums mum and dad both<br>professional people this father's been<br>through training that well he's been in<br>care and I've had short-term ones<br>emergency ones social welfare of asked<br>me to look after children for you know<br>short terms what's kept you involved in<br>the scheme way have you been involved<br>for four year on I love children and my<br>day is worked around all the children I<br>spend my time with them during the day<br>and I sort of feel that you've got one<br>you might as well have four<br>how do you feel about parents leaving<br>their children going out to work or not<br>being with them for whatever reason all<br>my viewers have changed since I first<br>started I really didn't think that it<br>was a good thing for parents to go out<br>and work my views have completely<br>changed I really feel that some children<br>are better off you know being cared for<br>they get the best of both worlds I feel<br>you know they come to my house they're<br>dropped off with mum and everything's<br>happy and mum goes away to work and they<br>spend the day with the other children<br>and they learn to share and they have<br>lots of attention and the moment they<br>come and pick them up at night and they<br>go home and they had that one-to-one<br>special treatment so I think really they<br>get the best of both worlds you're on<br>the executive now do you think it's<br>important for carers to be involved in<br>the administrative side I think so<br>because it gives the other members of is<br>it to an opinion from someone who's<br>working firsthand with children in the<br>problems that possibly come up and I<br>find it very good being involved anyway<br>yes your motivation certainly wouldn't<br>be financial you do get paid well it's<br>very nominal but I don't do it for the<br>money definitely not but it I will admit<br>that a little bit of pocket money you<br>know it does help and but I do it for<br>is it possible to provide loving healthy<br>stimulating alternative care for<br>children the Dunedin family day care<br>project is committed to providing<br>quality child care which combines the<br>experience as children get in a good<br>home with the experiences they get in a<br>good preschool center more than 100<br>preschoolers and 20 school children a<br>receiving daycare or after-school care<br>the scheme employs two administrative<br>staff four coordinators six preschool<br>staff and over 80 parents for a small<br>city like Dunedin it is a major project<br>which receives support from benardos New<br>Zealand the Social Welfare Department<br>the Education Department and the Labor<br>Department<br>family day care is the planned care of<br>children age zero to twelve years in a<br>home other than their own coordinators<br>visit people who wish the care for a<br>child to talk both about the family<br>daycare scheme and what their decision<br>potential carers are visited because the<br>coordinator needs to be assured that<br>carers with warmth and an interest in<br>children are able to provide a good<br>when a childcare inquiry is received<br>from a parent the coordinators do their<br>best to match the family needing care<br>with a family seeking to provide family<br>day care in terms of neighborhood age<br>number of children and personal<br>compatibility you user parents meet the<br>family of the carer suggested by the<br>coordinators and then decide whether<br>they would like a care arrangement with<br>that family if the child's parents would<br>like to meet another carer the<br>once the arrangement is finalized Kara<br>parents are supported and visited by<br>coordinators all financial arrangements<br>are made through the family daycare<br>office so that parents pay the center<br>and the center pays the carer<br>although carers are not paid a great<br>deal they enjoy being involved in the<br>scheme usually they are mothers and have<br>preschoolers of their own not only can<br>they earn some extra money but the<br>coordinators are very serious about<br>caring for the carers through extra<br>supports such as free preschool sessions<br>for their own child the free provision<br>of equipment including cots car<br>restraints and ride on toys carers have<br>the opportunity to meet together once a<br>week and enjoy the social contact with<br>other carers currently they are<br>interested in crafts activities but<br>sometimes speakers or workshops are<br>arranged their weekly meeting happens<br>while children attend preschool sessions<br>and gives them a break from the children<br>and the opportunity to share ideas and<br>problems with others in the group and<br>provide mutual support for instance if a<br>carer is sick or has a doctor's<br>appointment another familiar carer can<br>back her up by caring for her children<br>usually though the carers own extended<br>family or friend and neighbor systems<br>provide familiar backup care when it is<br>needed most carers also come to the<br>preschool sessions on a rostered basis<br>which gives them more ideas on the best<br>way to manage and stimulate young<br>children one of the unique features of<br>the Dunedin scheme is the preschool<br>component a preschool program for two<br>and a half to five year olds runs for<br>five morning's a week children usually<br>attend whatever number of sessions suits<br>the family on three mornings a toddler<br>plate program is available although each<br>child usually comes to only one session<br>the preschool also caters for about 34<br>community children who are not involved<br>in the family daycare schemes<br>the preschool Center provides<br>opportunities to enhance children's<br>excitement about learning for children<br>to make friends and learn to get along<br>with other children the center can<br>provide a bigger choice of activity than<br>can easily be provided at home and<br>trained staff are able to provide<br>particular learning experiences designed<br>to cater for individual differences<br>between children the preschool insists<br>on a manageable group size have no more<br>than 25 and favorable adult child ratios<br>about 1 to 6 for preschoolers and 1 to 3<br>for toddlers so that staff can provide<br>individual care and teaching extension<br>of play and emotional involvement with<br>the children<br>although most staff are trained when<br>adult at every session is usually a<br>volunteer carer parent or high school<br>student because of the high number of<br>adults at the center preschool staff<br>wear identifying overalls the care of<br>school-aged children is being asked for<br>more in most family daycare schemes<br>Dunedin family daycare with the support<br>of Labor Department funding has been<br>able to employ a coordinator to sit up<br>before school after school and school<br>holiday care she works in the afternoons<br>in order to liaise with schools the<br>children and their carers Jill Cameron<br>the scheme's Administrative Coordinator<br>believes that family daycare provides a<br>flexible attractive option amongst other<br>types of childcare available to Dunedin<br>parents<br>if you set up a good family daycare<br>scheme that aims for quality care it<br>will cost money<br>the alternative is money-saving methods<br>such as a high number of children per<br>carer in some countries such as the<br>United States one carer may take up to<br>ten children fortunately both Department<br>of social welfare regulations and our<br>attitudes do not favor such shortcuts<br>the continual effort and administrative<br>time in fundraising is demanding<br>fragmented temporary injections of small<br>sums are not a proper basis for funding<br>a major scheme like this one setting up<br>grants for preschool and carer equipment<br>and salary subsidies appropriate to<br>staff qualifications would make the<br>scheme more stable and secure the<br>Dunedin family daycare project is an<br>exciting experiment in community<br>involvement and initiative which<br>provides a high quality support service<br>for many Dunedin families and God care<br>and education for many children despite<br>the invaluable support received further<br>funding is an urgent need devotion and<br>dedication by itself is not enough to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
