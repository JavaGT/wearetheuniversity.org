Geraldine McDonald of the New<br>Zealand Council of educational research<br>believes that we do place limits on the<br>growth of boys and girls from the very<br>beginning the most important things<br>about a new baby is what six of it and<br>thanks parents know what the sex of the<br>child is they begin to treat it in a way<br>that in accordance with the six now this<br>means of course that girls are brought<br>up in one way and boys are brought up in<br>another way from immediately after birth<br>children are treated differently<br>according to state parents are<br>constantly reminded of what society<br>expects of boys and girls greeting cards<br>emphasized stereotypes gifts of pink<br>things for girls and blue things for<br>boys comments on the beauty and grace of<br>girl babies or the physical strength of<br>boy babies the thing is that sexual is<br>the behaviour that we think people<br>should should conform to<br>and we think that boys should act in a<br>certain way and that girls should act in<br>a certain way and if they don't behave<br>in that way and they're not behaving<br>appropriately female of course there's<br>got to be non aggressive she has to be<br>caring and nurturing it would be a good<br>idea if she falls over and hit herself<br>but she has a little cry she should help<br>her mother and so on well he doesn't<br>have to do those things he should be<br>strong and manly and keep his emotions<br>in check brave and aggressive and over<br>adventurous and a most important of all<br>he should be a leader the girl should<br>probably be a follower because roles are<br>complementary and if you gather have<br>leaders than me but have followers many<br>sociologists psychologists teachers and<br>parents have come to realize that<br>setting down one set of behaviors is<br>appropriate for one sex and a different<br>set for another sex is unnecessarily<br>restrictive children have much more<br>chance of fully developing their<br>potential as human beings if they're<br>able to develop all sorts of<br>characteristics regardless of sex there<br>is evidence that men and women who are<br>not restricted by sex roles stereotypes<br>are better adjusted socially and<br>psychologically and achieve a higher<br>level of education today's young people<br>are moving into a world where roles are<br>increasingly being shared how well are<br>we preparing them for the new more<br>flexible roles we start to channel human<br>behavior according to sex immediately<br>after birth considerable child<br>development research shows that parents<br>act differently towards boy and girl<br>babies boys are rocked and handled more<br>than girls and generally receive a<br>higher level of stimulation and learning<br>opportunities girls tend to be smiled at<br>talked to and looked at more than boys<br>although some have argued that the<br>different treatment occurs because the<br>babies are different to start with it is<br>doubtful whether this is an adequate<br>explanation<br>one study by Hannah Trish was designed<br>to see where the adults treat a baby<br>differently depending on whether they<br>think it was a boy or a girl the<br>University of Otago Department of<br>Education we set up a replication of<br>this study to illustrate it 14 month old<br>babies were brought into the university<br>player where they could be observed<br>through one-way mirror the mothers<br>stayed in the room in the background a<br>variety of toys were made available in<br>24 adults and babies took part in the<br>original study each baby was introduced<br>to two adults - the first as a boy and -<br>the second as a girl the adults were<br>asked to play with the baby for a short<br>period of time the babies were dressed<br>so that it was impossible to tell<br>whether they were a boy or a girl a<br>study showed that the adults played with<br>the baby differently depending of what<br>they thought of sex was if they thought<br>the baby was a girl they talked the baby<br>more it encouraged it towards nurturance<br>type of play such as cuddling the doll<br>dressing or feeding if they thought the<br>baby was a boy the adults tended to<br>encourage the baby towards active types<br>of play such as with the ball blocks or<br>trucks and towards male role poise at<br>the fireman's hat to check that the<br>adults weren't playing differently in<br>response to different play in the<br>children the study compared the type of<br>play of boys and girls and found that<br>there were no sex differences the study<br>showed that adults shape the behavior of<br>boys and girls from early on usually<br>unconsciously<br>the adults impression study generally<br>strongly held the view that boys and<br>girls should be treated equally parents<br>are the first and most powerful<br>influence on the shaping of six roles in<br>boys and girls parents influence<br>children first of all direct teaching<br>tend to reward children with approval<br>and other favorable consequences when<br>they're acting the way they want them to<br>they also punish them with unfavorable<br>consequences like disapproval or a smack<br>when they act in ways that they don't<br>like parents also influence children by<br>serving as models for their behavior<br>children learn a lot just by looking at<br>what people do and imitating their<br>behavior children are more likely to<br>imitate the parent who's of the same sex<br>as they are parents are the most<br>powerful models during the early years<br>since children are exposed to them<br>usually more than other people parents<br>often unknowingly lead children to<br>develop unnecessarily rigid sex roles<br>well parents always have an idea in<br>their minds of what girls and boys<br>should do and this is related to what<br>they think their children should be<br>doing when they're adults in the future<br>life we have to remember that the ideas<br>that parents have in their minds are<br>stereotyped ideas about what men and<br>women should do in society and these are<br>often called sex stereotyped roles we<br>have fixed ideas about what girls should<br>do and boys should do and these sounds<br>really close any note of the fact that<br>amongst boys you've got a wide variation<br>of types and kinds and the most girls<br>we've got the same accept the same<br>situation American psychologist Jerome<br>Kagan accepts that biological influences<br>on male and female anatomy and<br>physiology can lead to differences in<br>behaviors the organization of beliefs he<br>says however<br>there is no good reason for arguing but<br>these differences should place serious<br>constraints on the jobs and social roles<br>available in our society to quote from<br>his most recent book even if we<br>acknowledge that a small proportion of<br>vocations probably less than 1% a<br>biologically better suited to one sex<br>most jobs in Western society probably<br>could be filled satisfactorily by adults<br>of either sex parents even create a<br>different physical environment of boys<br>and girls one study of 48 boys and girls<br>rooms by Rheingold and Cooke showed that<br>the furnishing contents of boys and<br>girls rooms was very different boys<br>rooms were less decorative and more<br>functional than girls rooms they had<br>more educational material toys involved<br>the mechanical spatial ability sports<br>equipment the masculine home environment<br>encourages vigorous problem-solving<br>girls rooms had more flowers frills and<br>dolls the boys rooms in the study<br>contained 375 vehicles in the girls<br>rooms 17 whereas 26 of the girls rooms<br>had baby dolls but only three of the<br>boys feminine home environment<br>encourages passive nurtured and<br>John sterling is a farmer with four<br>children there are three girls and a boy<br>in the family the oldest girl karen is<br>fifteen and the second child a boy<br>chrisp is fourteen the two younger girls<br>are 18 for John shares with many New<br>Zealand fathers a concern that his<br>children especially the boy developed<br>the type of typical masculine and<br>feminine behavior he feels comfortable<br>with he's less concerned about Karen<br>being very feminine but wants Chris to<br>be typically masculine a girl to move<br>towards a more masculine role is<br>probably more simple thing for a man to<br>accept than a boy moving towards a more<br>feminine role and I think that as Karen<br>moved towards doing more tomboys things<br>and being involved for the things that<br>Chris was doing and I was doing I was<br>quite happy about that and I think that<br>I even compensated to a certain extent<br>of Kristin made sure what he did even<br>more masculine things rather than go the<br>other way and get him involved in what<br>might be called feel'n things John<br>clearly does hold different expectations<br>for the future of his oldest daughter<br>and his son when asked if he thought of<br>his daughter becoming a farmer when she<br>grew up John replied that he's never<br>given it a thought<br>Karen's main current job interest is in<br>becoming a hairdresser the possibility<br>of Chris becoming a farmer on the other<br>hand is one amongst others that the<br>family has considered it's not that jar<br>does not want his son to be able to show<br>emotions and be sensitive to other<br>people he sees with allowing boys to<br>play in a way which teaches them to care<br>for other people is firing to some<br>extent<br>well I'd agree with it up to a point and<br>I would certainly say that I'd like my<br>son to be those things you mentioned<br>loving kind and nurturing that if that<br>meant that he was going to become<br>infinite in the process and I think I'd<br>I prefer to be the way he was which at<br>times is less unpleasant and less than<br>kind<br>and very awful many New Zealand families<br>like the sterlings are bringing up boys<br>and girls with different expectations<br>for the future james and jane ritchie of<br>Waikato University found that parents<br>but especially fathers in New Zealand<br>are very often worried about their sons<br>behaving like sissies unfortunately<br>parents often confuse the social<br>emotional and intellectual<br>characteristics rather arbitrarily<br>ascribed to each sex with sexuality they<br>feel that if they allow boys or girls to<br>act like the opposite sex in everyday<br>behavior they won't be able to develop<br>normal heterosexual behavior when they<br>grow up stereotype sex roles have the<br>effect of preserving the existing social<br>structure where women have less<br>opportunity than men and do not<br>necessarily promote heterosexuality<br>already by the time children are old<br>enough the preschool round 3 the<br>pressures of parental teaching and<br>modeling have usually set the course of<br>sex role development on different tracks<br>by 3 or 4 children have developed rather<br>clear concept of sex roles they grasp<br>for example that it is impossible to<br>change a person's sex the development of<br>concepts about sex roles is rather<br>clearly related to other types of<br>cognitive development Lawrence Kohlberg<br>says that children learn to categorize<br>themselves according to sex they develop<br>and I am a girl feeling or I am a boy<br>feeling children then tend to organize<br>their feelings and activities around<br>their concepts of themselves as boys and<br>girls they have a positive feeling about<br>activities or characteristics which they<br>feel belong to their own sex<br>Claire Kaye is concerned that the<br>effects of over rigid sex role concepts<br>on children's development yes I think<br>that secretary taki is well established<br>when children come into preschool at 3<br>and unless we can liberate children a<br>little bit from the very rigid lines<br>they seem to be thinking along then<br>there isn't much hope for the teachers<br>later on I'm working with the sort of<br>thing I mean is that I think a lot of<br>little girls by the time they're three<br>already have a real pattern of standing<br>back watching and are almost convinced<br>that they can't do very much at all and<br>this seems to me to be very it's very<br>important to allow them to find out that<br>they can in fact do all sorts of homes<br>to allow boys to develop a full range of<br>emotions is as important as allowing<br>girls to be active and independent I<br>think we have a lot of boys in the<br>center who enjoy dressing up very much<br>and who play with dolls and they show<br>all sorts of gentler emotions when<br>they're in this sort of play but carry<br>over to cooperative play with other<br>children and again I think to allow boys<br>to develop a full range of emotions and<br>show these is very important preschool<br>children have been shown in many studies<br>to have rather different patterns of<br>play for example in 1975 Marybel<br>organized the observational study of<br>children in 42 preschools in Wellington<br>the Northland on to fine morning's<br>sample therefore included well over<br>thousand children boys were found to use<br>the climbing equipment sandpit carpenter<br>table<br>blocks and bikes and trolleys<br>considerably more than girls girls<br>predominated in the family corner dough<br>table painting and music corner<br>generally boys have been found to be<br>more involved in active physical or<br>spatial activities while girls prefer<br>more passive play including social<br>family and expressive activities girls<br>also tend to have more verbal and<br>physical contact with adults and to show<br>during the preschool years children<br>begin to show a preference for playing<br>with peers of the same sex boys are more<br>likely to be seen playing with boys and<br>girls with girls peers can shape each<br>other's behavior by acting as models and<br>by showing approval or disapproval for<br>each other's behavior several studies<br>have shown that children tend to have<br>more interactions both of the positive<br>and negative kind with children of the<br>same sex one common problem in the<br>preschool is that children exclude each<br>other from an area thought to be the<br>preserve of their sex in an awkward<br>observation study in a preschool setting<br>elizabeth conley observed many rejection<br>incidents by boys of girls in both the<br>sandpit and the block area christine<br>Rietveld observed similar rejection of<br>boys by girls in the family corner<br>although the vast majority of preschool<br>teachers were supervisors quite unaware<br>of sexual stereotyping in their centers<br>there is good evidence that it is very<br>widespread school both schools and<br>kindergartens have a very great effect<br>on the way in which girls and boys feel<br>about themselves now if they're a school<br>teacher or kindergarten teachers forever<br>talking about the girls doing this on<br>the boys doing that or praising girls<br>for doing certain things and voids for<br>for doing other things and naturally the<br>girls and boys are going to continue to<br>learn stereotyped roles in life another<br>influence is the modeling one where<br>girls and boys will have a look at the<br>person who's teaching them if there is a<br>woman always teaching young children<br>then that's what young children think<br>the world is like women always deal with<br>young children when they get further up<br>through the school of course they'll<br>find out that the princess<br>a man and again this will be their view<br>of the world and give them ideas about<br>what they're going to do and they suit<br>your life I think also that the behavior<br>teaches themselves show in front of<br>children<br>helps to often helps to reinforce the<br>stereotype of appropriate behavior for<br>women especially for girls for instance<br>if they see teachers who really don't<br>like to get messy we like to stay neat<br>all the time and who don't feel<br>themselves competent to deal with quite<br>simple things that go wrong perhaps her<br>tablets dripping or a hinge that needs<br>screwing up or something of that sort<br>and feel that they have automatically<br>got to call a man and to do that I think<br>that that sort of a token will reinforce<br>to each other very often and the very<br>places our teacher stands around the<br>room helped to model what she considers<br>appropriate there is a real dearth of<br>preschool teachers who enjoy doing<br>carpentry and motion carpentry skills<br>and I think that's very significant we<br>do need more teachers of both sexes<br>working in preschool vex ro behavior can<br>also be learned from symbolic model such<br>as books and television as well as from<br>real-life people another thing about<br>kindergartens and schools of courses are<br>their sources and books and these books<br>are again the sort of material that will<br>indicate to young children<br>what they're supposed to do in later<br>life unfortunately the books that have<br>been given them to children in the past<br>have shown girls and women in a very<br>limited range of roles adult women for<br>example are usually shown as housewives<br>and men are shown in all sorts of<br>interesting occupations boys and stories<br>often have terrific adventures they go<br>off alone and they do interesting things<br>and they and they lead people which is<br>all very nice girls shown in the same<br>books tend to follow the boys<br>fear that people don't show very much<br>aggressiveness and so on now these are<br>all learning experiences for young<br>children in 1976 Marysol work from the<br>Oakland Teachers College asked a group<br>of kindergarten teachers to bring their<br>three favorite children's books to an<br>in-service course here is the list of<br>roles available for males and females in<br>the books men were shown in 58 enormous<br>Lea varied roles from astronomer to<br>traffic controller and women were in<br>only six rather limited roles of a<br>caring or service nature this book about<br>an airport illustrates the fact that<br>there are more varied roles available to<br>men than to women<br>Marysol rook also analyzed the emotions<br>activities and behavior portrayed in<br>boys and men compared to girls and women<br>against females were shown in emotional<br>passive often trivial behaviors or<br>feelings while the ylenne were active<br>aggressive outgoing larger-than-life the<br>council for equal pay an opportunity in<br>1975 examines New Zealand infant readers<br>published by the Education Department<br>Price Melbourne and reads males<br>comprised 44% of all characters and<br>females only 23% to say that the books<br>merely represents society is therefore<br>clearly untrue there was considerable<br>evidence that the roles portrayed were<br>stereotyped adult women were mainly seen<br>as wives and mothers doing domestic and<br>caring work girls as passive background<br>figures men were again found in many<br>roles little boys have an exciting time<br>are naughty and have a lot of fun though<br>these books have an influence on<br>children's attitudes or beliefs about<br>what they can do a study by flirts<br>fiddler and Rogers in 1976 convincingly<br>demonstrates that exposure to<br>stereotyped models and books can give<br>children restricted concepts of what<br>normal male and female behavior consists<br>on and that presenting males and<br>females in non-traditional roles in<br>books gives children a more flexible<br>understanding of sex roles the study has<br>been replicated in the Dunedin<br>kindergarten a hugger the study involved<br>randomly assigning preschool children to<br>two story reading groups both groups<br>were read stories for half an hour for<br>five consecutive days in a week<br>one group of children were read<br>egalitarian non stereotype stories it's<br>a good night and watch it sighs cries<br>and then when you wanted to wake it up<br>in the morning and the Sun came in and<br>start all over again the other group of<br>children were read traditional stories<br>where males and females were shown in<br>the usual stereotyped roles the girls<br>who had the egalitarian stories showed a<br>marked change of attitudes in the<br>direction of believing a much greater<br>array of behaviors to be appropriate for<br>both sexes boys did not show a change in<br>attitude the study showed that the<br>change in attitude was not a lasting one<br>and began to fade after another week the<br>effect however was quite remarkable<br>considering the relatively brief<br>exposure to a balanced representation of<br>sex roles and the enormous amount of<br>exposure to traditional roles in other<br>books although women are shown in a<br>narrow range of occupations in books for<br>school children in real life they fill a<br>larger variety of roles and you can<br>check this from looking at the synthesis<br>material in 1975 women asked that the<br>books that are produced by the Education<br>Department should take notice of us and<br>show women in a wider range of roles now<br>this effect has been done it was one of<br>the most encouraging things that I've<br>seen the girls are now shown as heroines<br>as the central characters in stories<br>more often than they were in the past<br>girls are shown in more daring<br>situations they are shown as being more<br>adventurous and reminisce<br>and a wider range of occupations and all<br>of these things are quite true and quite<br>accurate to life's like I bet you don't<br>accept the argument but you're going<br>outside what already exists there is<br>evidence then that girls can be<br>influenced towards developing<br>self-reliance and confidence learning to<br>accept responsibility and being<br>independent by reading books which<br>portray women like this books can also<br>help boys to overcome the barriers<br>against developing feelings and caring<br>for other people<br>fortunately there is gradually coming<br>about an improvement in the treatment of<br>sex roles in books publishers such as<br>price in Auburn have made a real effort<br>to avoid over rigid stereotyping despite<br>the availability of these books there<br>still exists the problem that sexist<br>readers are still present in the schools<br>it is important to actually remove the<br>worst ones at the preschool level also<br>teachers need to look critically at the<br>books present first 5 to 7 years of life<br>the years of early childhood provide<br>some of the most powerful influences in<br>shaping our future lives parents are<br>usually the most powerful teachers and<br>models what can parents do to enhance<br>healthy sex role development first thing<br>that they can do is share roles<br>themselves within the home and then they<br>act as models for their children if they<br>have a clear idea of their mind but both<br>girls and boys should have a free choice<br>of occupations and roles in the future<br>then I think that they can present this<br>point of view they can make sure that<br>they choose reading matter that doesn't<br>depict stereotyped roles for the for the<br>two sexes they can make sure that that<br>within the home that the boys take take<br>some part in the household tasks when<br>caring for babies and they can approve<br>all things that girls want to do there<br>traditionally in the male domain but<br>it's important for them to be able to<br>see that their mother does work now with<br>others paid or not as a matter that may<br>that'd be very important but the fact<br>that they don't woman can can work<br>certainly is an important issue and<br>increasing willingness to change the<br>habitual pattern of family<br>responsibilities is coming about in New<br>Zealand a little weight and Colin Pearce<br>house are an example the family who have<br>not stayed with traditional roles and<br>senior lecturer here in the physiology<br>department of the university so that the<br>job involves quite a bit of teaching I<br>teach medical and dental and science<br>students and the other main part of it<br>is to do research a number of research<br>projects going when we thought that we'd<br>like to have a family we tried to think<br>how we were going to organize it we felt<br>that it wouldn't be possible for us both<br>to stay in professions that were really<br>quite demanding terms of ours and so<br>that we felt one person would have to<br>leave and the situation at the time was<br>that I was in physiology and thoroughly<br>enjoying it and my husband was in<br>computing and was rather disillusioned<br>and dissatisfied with it and we so we<br>thought about whether we couldn't make<br>it work the other way around and and I<br>think that it was the right decision<br>that's worked really very wrong on her<br>small farm in rather an old house and<br>most of my day goes in and either doing<br>house renovations or doing the farm work<br>with Richard comes home from school<br>and I go to meet him in those days and<br>it comes and worked with me up until Tom<br>building<br>Robert the younger so he's being touted<br>box the 110 is equal tom chunking so<br>that gives me from say 9:00 in the<br>morning to 3 in the afternoon to get on<br>with renovating a house but if the<br>children is sick or their school<br>holidays then yes it's my job to look<br>after the kids I'm responsible for<br>getting the year big meal and the<br>day-to-day running the house the<br>shopping washing baby's clothes these<br>sort of things when Phil comes home in<br>the evening she does the ironing mending<br>and things like that I think the biggest<br>regret of course is that there is now<br>only one salary coming in and we've had<br>to adjust to that and I think I also<br>regret from time to time not having many<br>people around I often miss the<br>opportunity of talking to other people<br>and exchanging ideas and thoughts<br>disloyalty Collin and Phil do get some<br>help with childcare for Robert from a<br>Dunedin family daycare scheme so the<br>role reversal is not complete<br>overall Collin and Phil are very happy<br>with their decision I think there are<br>any problems in life so I think there's<br>still one or two people who consider<br>what I'm doing is a bit out of the<br>ordinary they tend to be older people so<br>hopefully that you know it will all<br>change as far as other advantages<br>Richards five and and Robert's nearly<br>two and at this stage there's a lot of<br>development going on in Richards<br>learning to read and Robert's learning<br>to talk unable to<br>see aware of that then it's real I think<br>we both like to that I'm privileged in<br>their own the other really powerful<br>influence on young children is the<br>preschool and school environment and<br>especially the teachers probably the<br>first important prerequisite for change<br>is that teachers understand what is<br>going on by being aware of their<br>interactions with children and other<br>children's behavior first thing I<br>thought to do is to realize that was<br>three six roles a stereotype a lot of<br>people I think would probably deny that<br>that children are taught stereotyped<br>roles and schools and yet there's plenty<br>of evidence that our boys are treated<br>differently from girls well I think the<br>biggest single change you could could<br>make would be to pay decent salaries so<br>that we could employ people on the basis<br>of whether they were good at helping<br>children grow rather than prepared to<br>accept what's offering in the way of pay<br>I think to encourage children to join in<br>the full range of activities and to<br>actually step in when children exclude<br>each other on the basis of sex from<br>activities are both terribly important<br>it's not enough merely to provide<br>carpentry and wait and see whether the<br>girls will take it out as much as a<br>voice you have to offer active<br>encouragement and help children learn<br>skills at home when children exclude the<br>opposite sex from an activity Claire Kay<br>believes that firm action must be taken<br>by a teacher it was usually boys on big<br>climbing equipment junk equipment he<br>said this is for boys girls can't play<br>you and I really think you have to step<br>in when that happens I don't think you<br>can let that by I would try to suggest a<br>role for the for the other child who<br>wanted to get in and that was usually<br>usually quite effective and I think to<br>actually confront the issue and say that<br>all the equipment is for all the<br>children is also very important children<br>can also be tempted into activities that<br>they don't normally do well again I<br>think<br>the role is important and I think it's<br>also it's interesting samples sometimes<br>and sometimes possible to suggest a role<br>reversal and I think it's crucial for<br>boys to learn to express emotions tender<br>emotions as well as aggressive ones<br>let's see anything that really will lead<br>to us having a civilized adult<br>population the problem that most of the<br>adult models are female is one that<br>needs attention salary and working<br>conditions are important but there are<br>public attitudes I think it's a<br>disadvantage in one way to have women so<br>heavily represented I think there should<br>be a place for men as models in<br>preschools and in junior schools it's<br>not very good idea so far as I can see<br>to have the new primary schools the<br>women all in the junior classes and the<br>senior positions hit master the<br>principal's position and often the<br>deputy principal feel fine and they're<br>like this does more than give children a<br>model of what they should do as person<br>this gives them a model of society but<br>can we really change the division of<br>labor between the sexes in our society<br>simply through socializing children<br>distinctly Kjell Dean McDonald certainly<br>does not believe that this is the<br>complete answer there are two things<br>that we have to think about when we're<br>talking about socializing children into<br>six roles now we can treat children in a<br>way that is not stereotyped so that we<br>can broaden the range of ways in which<br>little girls can act and broaden the<br>range of ways in which boys connect then<br>as adults we can assume that they would<br>have a wider range of choices in jobs<br>things they do in the home who cares for<br>children a whole range of things but<br>that is not going to make a great deal<br>of difference unless Society also makes<br>a range of changes so that men and women<br>can take up the options I'm thinking<br>here for example say for example that<br>you<br>had brought up a little boy so that he<br>didn't think that it was to care<br>for young children when he's an adult he<br>thinks it'll be rather nice of he took<br>some time off work and looked after his<br>own child he can only do that if working<br>conditions allows him to do it if we<br>have such things as a bride time which<br>was which is already accepted of course<br>but you also need to have leave parental<br>leave people need to be able to go back<br>into their jobs and not be disadvantaged<br>because they've taken time off to care<br>for children and so on so it's two<br>things we have to prepare people for a<br>wide range of options and we have to<br>prepare society so if those options can<br>be taken out</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
