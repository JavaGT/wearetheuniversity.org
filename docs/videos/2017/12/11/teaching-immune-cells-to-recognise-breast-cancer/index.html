This short film was created by Maddy Brennan as part of her Masters in Science Communication at University of Otago.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>it's a diagnosis that thousands of New<br>Zealand women must face many women will<br>win their battle against breast cancer<br>but for others treatment can only go so<br>far the tumor will return stronger and<br>more aggressive a Totaro University<br>Katrin Kramer is working to fight these<br>tumors I'm working on cancer vaccines so<br>basically trying to stimulate the immune<br>system so the immune cells can kill<br>cancer cells so the current therapies<br>like radiation therapy or chemotherapy<br>they pretty much does get rid of the<br>cancer but very often there's a few<br>cancer cells left at the treatment<br>country to get rid of and these cancer<br>cells can then grow again mutate more<br>and then spread throughout your body so<br>what we really want to do is to treat<br>the first cancer get rid of the bulk<br>mass of the cancer and then vaccinate so<br>the cancer won't come back through her<br>research<br>Katrin now knows how to get the<br>patient's immune system to recognize the<br>cancer every cancer has a certain set of<br>proteins on it and we can use those<br>proteins to target the cancer cells I<br>found two different of those proteins<br>one is called survivin and one is called<br>mutant one then they expressed in about<br>90% of breast cancers those are commonly<br>known ones that you can find in<br>different papers catrin's next challenge<br>was to get the immune system to accept<br>them the best way to achieve this was to<br>use a virus like particle which acts as<br>transportation and wakes up the immune<br>system<br>combining the particle and proteins in a<br>chemical solution they become attached<br>you can change the virus-like particle<br>the structure of it to include this<br>protein on the particle these virus-like<br>particles can really stimulate immune<br>cells and then they also get those<br>proteins make the cells recognize the<br>cancer so they can then hold back to the<br>cancer pretty much and kill the cancer<br>cells your immune system will then know<br>what the tumor cells look like and as<br>soon as you get another one that looks<br>exactly the same as the breast cancer<br>you had before your immune system will<br>recognize it straight away and get rid<br>of it<br>Katrin is currently working on attaching<br>the cancer proteins to the virus-like<br>particles but one day soon there may be<br>a novel treatment that teaches our<br>bodies to fight the breast cancer itself</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
