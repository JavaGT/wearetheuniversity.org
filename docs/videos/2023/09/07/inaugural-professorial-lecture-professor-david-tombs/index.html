these auspicious occasions<br>it's great to see members of our general<br>and academic staff students from the<br>University of otago and members of the<br>general public as well as representation<br>from the University Council<br>in addition however we have a couple of<br>other special welcomes to make this<br>evening David's wife Rebecca is here and<br>his daughter Rachel and I understand<br>that son Ben might possibly be watching<br>us via live stream so we can all have a<br>shout out to Ben he is currently on his<br>semester abroad at the University of<br>Sydney<br>I'm sure many of you know that Professor<br>tombs is the Howard Patterson chair in<br>public Theology and the director of the<br>center for Theology and public issues<br>and by way of background I just want to<br>remind you that this particular chair<br>has been made possible by some very<br>generous donations<br>Howard Patterson actually studied the<br>phenomenology phenomenology of religion<br>atatago and throughout his life he<br>actually retained an interest in<br>theology<br>the Patterson charitable trust made a<br>major donation towards the center with<br>the support also coming from the Synod<br>of otago and Southland and from Ian and<br>Annette tullich<br>this Center was actually the first<br>center in New Zealand to examine<br>political social and economic issues<br>from a theological perspective<br>and the foundation chair was Professor<br>Andrew bradstock<br>when Professor bradstock made the<br>decision to return to the UK for family<br>reasons the university launched an<br>international search to find his<br>replacement<br>and we are very pleased tonight to<br>welcome Professor David tombs to this<br>position<br>he has come from to us from Trinity<br>College in Dublin and he took up his<br>position at the University of otago in<br>January of 2015.<br>there is no doubt that David is a<br>scholar with an immense International<br>reputation<br>his work engages with significant<br>contemporary issues<br>his published work and published<br>lectures have tackled some really<br>important topics like Abu greb the death<br>of Gaddafi and work with truth<br>Commissions in places like timor-lest<br>South Africa Central America and a<br>little bit closer to his former home<br>Northern Ireland<br>his work is also extremely<br>interdisciplinary it is ideally suited<br>to continue the work of Professor<br>bradstock who started building links<br>between the university and religious and<br>secular bodies outside it<br>David is also a superb teacher and he<br>has received awards for his teaching and<br>he also holds a professional teaching<br>certificate and he is a very popular<br>Masters and PhD supervisor<br>David has literally worked all over the<br>world<br>the U.S Sri Lanka El Salvador and the<br>Czech Republic<br>the University of otago is delighted<br>that he and his family have now chosen<br>Dunedin as their home and on behalf of<br>the University Professor tombs I would<br>like to officially warmly welcome you to<br>this position<br>I will now hand over to<br>the Provost Chancellor of humanities the<br>head of the Department of religion and<br>theology<br>to tell us a bit more about David's<br>uh thank you Vice Chancellor if not for<br>the inadvertent promotion<br>I'm not the pro Vice Chancellor for<br>humanities nor will I be uh<br>on behalf of the department it's my<br>pleasure to welcome you all here tonight<br>um as well as to those of you watching<br>the live stream uh and to introduce to<br>you uh Professor David tombs<br>David took up his post as Howard<br>Patterson professor of Theology and<br>public issues and director of the center<br>for Theology and public issues in<br>January of this year he came to us from<br>the Irish School of ecumenics where he<br>was a director of the center for<br>post-conflict justice<br>although the Irish School of ecumenix is<br>a part of Trinity College Dublin for<br>most of his time there David worked from<br>Belfast and I understand that there's<br>occasionally caused some problems for<br>postgraduate students who arrived in the<br>country with the wrong Visa<br>or a Visa for the wrong country not to<br>mention also some difficulties on<br>occasion in explaining to the good<br>people of Belfast the difference between<br>David's decision to take the job at the<br>ISE arose directly from his interest in<br>liberation theology about which he's<br>going to talk tonight and it's<br>continuing profound Legacy for those<br>whose engagement with public issues is<br>informed by theological reflection<br>the Irish school is one of the founding<br>institutions together with the center<br>for the Theology and public issues at<br>otago of the global Network for public<br>Theology and it was through Professor<br>Murray Ray who with others in the<br>department helped to establish this<br>depart this network that David first<br>came into contact with otago<br>David's interest in Liberation theology<br>goes back to his time as an<br>undergraduate in Theology and philosophy<br>at Trinity College in Oxford in the late<br>1980s and it was also nurtured<br>subsequently by James Cohn Cornell West<br>and others during his STM at Union<br>Theological Seminary in New York<br>after training as a teacher of religious<br>education at the University of<br>Birmingham David earned his Doctorate<br>the hard way by part-time study at<br>hathrop College while also lecturing in<br>religious and Theological studies at the<br>University of Roehampton from 1992 to<br>2001.<br>at hathrop he was supervised by two<br>Jesuits Dr Joseph Lashley and Dr James<br>hanvey<br>David also has the unusual distinction<br>of having published a monograph before<br>completing his PhD entitled Latin<br>American liberation theology published<br>by Brill in 2002 it has been described<br>by Professor Mario Aguilar of the<br>University of Saint Andrews as the book<br>on Liberation theology<br>Liberation theology has long attracted<br>the attention of theologians from a<br>range of different Traditions including<br>those at otago in 1991 an ox theological<br>Hall and Holy Cross College co-hosted a<br>conference on Liberation theology and in<br>the following year the then faculty of<br>theology at the University published a<br>short book on the churches and the<br>revolution in Nicaragua by a young by a<br>young scholar who over a decade later<br>would go on to become the first<br>incumbent of the Howard Patterson chair<br>however especially in the Latin American<br>context with which David has worked<br>liberation theology has had a<br>particularly Catholic and even<br>specifically Jesuit character it's no<br>surprise then that Pope Francis who is<br>both the first Jesuit and also the first<br>Latin American to be Pope has recently<br>revitalized interest in the legacies of<br>Liberation theology<br>when I asked David whether he regarded<br>his own work as emerging from a<br>distinctively Anglican intellectual<br>tradition he had co-cated in such a way<br>in addition to his shaping by the<br>Catholic and Jesuit tradition he<br>constitutes an Anglican minority within<br>his otherwise president Syrian family so<br>his practical experience of ecumenix<br>extends Beyond his time in Ireland<br>in addition to the book already<br>mentioned David has published some 25<br>book chapters and journal articles as<br>well as seven edited volumes and a<br>number of further shorter contributions<br>an important and continuing work uh<br>theme in his work over more than two<br>decades now is shame which will also be<br>taken up in a book on sexualized<br>violence crucifixion and Christian<br>ethics which is currently under<br>preparation<br>David's appointment to the Howard<br>Patterson chair and to the center comes<br>at an exciting time in his years at<br>otago Andrew bradstock did an excellent<br>job in establishing the center and<br>gaining for a very visible public<br>profile he did however often comment on<br>the difficulty of sustaining engagement<br>with government from Dunedin<br>we are therefore delighted that with the<br>support of Saint John's in the city<br>Presbyterian Church in Wellington the<br>Synod of otago in Southland and other<br>donors we have been able recently to<br>advertise lectureship in Christian<br>Theology and public issues<br>the lecture will be based in Wellington<br>and in addition to teaching papers on<br>public theology which will be available<br>to distance students throughout the<br>country he will also who he or she will<br>also be tasked under David's Guidance<br>with establishing a presence for the<br>Center in Wellington and hosting events<br>there<br>so David will have much to do but first<br>I invite him to deliver his inaugural<br>professorial lecture Latin American<br>theology liberation theology and its<br>technical to tenico to tenakotu katoa<br>my thanks to the vice Chancellor and to<br>my head of department for the kind words<br>in welcoming me<br>to my colleagues here at the University<br>in the division and in the department<br>for the exceptionally warm welcome that<br>you have given me coming to Dunedin<br>to The Visionaries and generous<br>supporters of this extraordinary and<br>privileged academic position<br>the Howard Patterson chair and director<br>of the center for Theology and public<br>issues<br>and to Kirsten air our Administrative<br>Assistant who keeps the whole show on<br>the road in a calm and efficient way<br>it's my great pleasure to speak on Latin<br>American Liberation theology and why I<br>believe that it has an ongoing Legacy<br>for Christian theology in the 21st<br>century<br>I took Liberation theology as the topic<br>for this lecture because I've been very<br>influenced by it since I first learned<br>about it as an undergraduate<br>and because all of a sudden Liberation<br>theology is once again featuring in<br>this front page photo in the New York<br>Times on 24th May 2015 featured a mural<br>to Archbishop Oscar Romero of San<br>Salvador who was murdered at the altar<br>on 24 March 1980.<br>the mural names Romero as Saint Romero<br>of America it was headlined Pope's focus<br>on poor revived scorned theology<br>the news story describes how six months<br>after becoming the first Latin American<br>pontiff Pope Francis<br>invited the Peruvian priest Gustavo<br>Gutierrez who was widely acknowledged as<br>the founding father of Latin American<br>liberation theology for a meeting at his<br>Vatican residence<br>in the 1980s an invitation to Rome might<br>have been a cause of concern for<br>Gutierrez<br>ation marked a much more cordial<br>attitude towards him and his work<br>it's no coincidence that soon after his<br>appointment Pope Francis also took steps<br>to address the difficulties which were<br>preventing progress and the canonization<br>of Romero<br>although Romero has long been spoken of<br>as San Romero by many in Latin America<br>and they have worked tirelessly for his<br>sainthood to be reflected in the formal<br>canonization process<br>prior to Francis the case seemed to be<br>stalled<br>by contrast under Francis Romero was<br>declared to be a martyr to the faith and<br>his beatification followed on 23rd May<br>2015.<br>almost 35 years to the day since his<br>murder<br>beatrification is the crucial stage in<br>the canonization process which now looks<br>to be firmly back on course<br>this is not to say that Romero or<br>Liberation theology no longer have<br>health style critics<br>statue in San Salvador was vandalized at<br>the time of his beatification you can<br>see it as it was before on the left and<br>subsequently on the right<br>his right hand holding the cross was cut<br>off presumably to signal that in the<br>eyes of his opponents far from being<br>remembered as a saint he would not even<br>be remembered as a member of the church<br>cutting the hand off the statue to send<br>a political message is also a reminder<br>of some of the worst days of conflict in<br>El Salvador When Death squads sometimes<br>cut off the left hand of their victims<br>to signaled that they had killed a<br>suspected leftist<br>but elsewhere a much more positive view<br>of Liberation theology and its Legacy<br>has come to the fore<br>this can be seen in France's own writing<br>especially in his encyclical laudato C<br>on the environment which has been<br>described by one commentator as the most<br>significant statement on Theology and<br>public issues ever<br>amongst other things it links the urgent<br>need for care of the planet with a<br>special concern for the poor<br>and we might also expect to hear Echoes<br>of Liberation theology during France's<br>visit to the United States later this<br>month<br>this evening I hope to speak to three<br>areas<br>first my encounters with the works in<br>Liberation theology at different points<br>in my studies and career<br>second what I think made it distinctive<br>as a theology how it developed and grew<br>as a movement and why I believe that<br>although it is unlikely to ever return<br>as a movement in church and Society<br>along the lines that it had in the 1970s<br>and 1980s<br>nonetheless it has left a vital Legacy<br>for Christian theology in the 21st<br>century<br>third how it might influence a<br>theological response to pressing public<br>issues of our day including torture<br>sexual abuse and the refugee crisis<br>so there's a lot to do and I'm under<br>strict instructions not to speak for<br>more than a couple of hours so I I<br>let me begin with a little bit about<br>myself<br>I was born in a far away place on the<br>other outer edge of London which in turn<br>as you will know is a distant land<br>virtually on the outer edge of the world<br>map and quite unlike the wonderful<br>centrality that we are blessed with here<br>I grew up in a committed Christian<br>family which took religious Faith<br>seriously<br>at school I was encouraged by a Fearless<br>teacher of religious studies Ian Walker<br>to think<br>more about biblical criticism and what<br>implications it had for faith<br>how much of the Bible was true<br>how did we know this what difference did<br>it make<br>to explore these questions further I had<br>an opportunity to go to Oxford to study<br>for a ba in philosophy and theology<br>and I spent hours in the theology<br>section of the bodlian library which was<br>for lower<br>floor of the Radcliffe camera pictured<br>here<br>first year<br>I accompanied my older brother on a<br>summer trip to travel and volunteer on a<br>small community development project in<br>Peru<br>at a time when the armed conflict was<br>Sendero luminoso was still intense and<br>the violence and difficulties in proven<br>Society were very apparent<br>soon after my return from Peru for my<br>second year at Oxford I noticed this<br>book in the theology section of<br>blackpool's Bookshop<br>I was drawn to the picture on the front<br>cover sorry it's a little small<br>but it's a study and Stark contrasts<br>which were quite familiar to me from my<br>trip to Peru but were not at all<br>familiar to me from a year sitting in<br>the theology reading room<br>up above there are lines of<br>military-style police and distinctive<br>helmets<br>beneath there are people in a very poor<br>neighborhood<br>separated by the title A Theology of<br>liberation<br>there's an implied question on how these<br>two scenes are related<br>and what this has to do with theology<br>so I tracked the book down in the<br>library I was a student so I couldn't<br>buy it myself but I went to the library<br>and read further into liberation<br>theology and what it had to offer<br>this had to be fitted around the rest of<br>the theology syllabus since liberation<br>theology did not feature in its own<br>right<br>but my generous tutor at Trinity College<br>Trevor Williams was supportive of his<br>students following their own theological<br>interests and I will always be grateful<br>to him for this<br>at in the library reading more about<br>Liberation theology and its relevance in<br>Latin America<br>I also thought more about religion<br>closer to home in the Multicultural and<br>multi-faith context of Britain in the<br>1980s<br>and what difference religious beliefs<br>made to how people lived<br>in the last year of my ba I decided that<br>I want to explore this side of the<br>question further I applied to the<br>University of Birmingham to train as a<br>teacher of multi-faith religious<br>education in state secondary schools<br>before doing so however I was lucky to<br>be offered a scholarship to go to Union<br>Theological Seminary in New York for a<br>one-year master's degree in theology<br>and this was too good an opportunity to<br>miss<br>since it would allow me to do a whole<br>Year's further specialist work on<br>Liberation theology and look at not just<br>Latin American but also other contexts<br>the Seminary quite different to what I<br>expected was in a beautiful building<br>located on Broadway between Columbia<br>University and Riverside Church on Upper<br>West Side of Manhattan and I had a<br>wonderful year there<br>were many influential professors at<br>Union and opportunities to study<br>Liberation theologies in different<br>contexts including Asian liberation<br>theology where it engaged with the<br>Multicultural context multi-faith<br>context and feminist Liberation<br>theologies which asked a very different<br>set of questions<br>some of the most challenging questions<br>were asked by James Cohn the founding<br>figure of black liberation theology<br>and one piece of advice he offered to<br>graduate students that have stuck with<br>me<br>is when you study theology<br>you should look for what questions are<br>at the end of the year I spent the<br>summer of 98 of 88 traveling over land<br>by succession of buses of varied quality<br>across Mexico<br>across the U.S first then across Mexico<br>then on to Guatemala El Salvador and<br>Honduras<br>El Salvador at that time was still<br>suffering at Civil War<br>which had broken out in the year that<br>Romero had been assassinated and lasted<br>throughout the whole of the 1980s<br>it was an interesting time to be<br>traveling in Central America and seeing<br>the work of the church in places like<br>San Francisco gutera pictured here<br>which was on the boundary of the area<br>controlled by government forces and the<br>area held by Rebel groups<br>there was a lot more I wanted to learn<br>about the church in Central America and<br>it was tempting to enroll on the PHD<br>program back at Union and Colombia and<br>continue my studies there<br>but I decided to stick with the original<br>plan and learn more about religious<br>diversity in the context of the UK<br>so I went to Birmingham to train as a<br>teacher as planned and started learning<br>about other religious Traditions as well<br>as Christianity for the first time<br>after completing my Year's training I<br>was lucky enough to find a job at<br>Lambton comprehensive School in West<br>London<br>this was an opportunity to teach<br>religious studies in a context of<br>remarkable cultural and religious<br>diversity<br>and to learn more about how religious<br>identity was shaping the personal and<br>social identities and the outlooks of<br>young people<br>identity issues which are explored so<br>enjoyably in this classic text<br>which is set in the part of London I was<br>working and many of you are probably<br>familiar with and if you don't know it I<br>warmly recommend it Bend It Like Beckham<br>after three years of the school<br>which I combined with the part-time<br>evening Masters in Education at the<br>University of London a move to<br>Roehampton offered a chance to teach<br>theology at University level in a<br>department of Theology and religious<br>studies<br>and it also allowed me to continue<br>part-time study and start my PhD at<br>Heathrow had a Jesuit Foundation an<br>excellent International links so it was<br>a great place to return to my interests<br>in liberation theology<br>in fact it had established a partnership<br>with the Catholic development Agency<br>cafford for a scholarship which would<br>support a student studying liberation<br>theology<br>and I was lucky enough to be offered<br>this for a year which allowed me to make<br>the first of two visits to El Salvador<br>as part of my doctoral work<br>and this in turn drew me back into the<br>church in Central America and Romero's<br>my work on Liberation theology as a<br>movement dating from this time<br>eventually led to my book Latin American<br>liberation theology which was published<br>in 2002.<br>I can take no credit at all for the<br>beautiful cover design the catcher way<br>of the cross<br>but I am very honored that the Marion or<br>fathers and brothers gave permission for<br>its use and pleased that if people do<br>judge my book by its cover they'll get a<br>the book develops the idea of Liberation<br>theology as a movement in two senses<br>first it was not just about ideas and<br>thoughts it was also an organized<br>Collective movement within the church<br>that sought to reach out beyond the<br>church to make a concrete difference in<br>The Wider world<br>second both the theological ideas and<br>the outworking of the ideas in the<br>organized movement developed and grew in<br>distinctive stages<br>one can think about Latin American<br>Liberation theology as a reasonably<br>cohesive entity but it's also important<br>to distinguish distinctive phases in its<br>development<br>its backgrounds and Origins were in the<br>1950s and 1960s<br>and these built on Catholic Social<br>teaching and the spirit of Catholic<br>renewal initiated by Vatican II in the<br>early 1960s<br>aspers of renewal incidentally that will<br>not be marked by a series of three<br>lectures on Living Faith in the world<br>offered by the Catholic Education<br>Council here next week which might be of<br>interest to some of you<br>then the formal emergence of Liberation<br>theology can be dated fairly precisely<br>to the year 1968 and three separate<br>events that launched it that year<br>one was gutierrez's conference paper<br>notes on a Theology of Liberation which<br>outlines the key insights to be<br>elaborated more fully in his influential<br>book three years later<br>another was the meeting of the Latin<br>American Bishops at Medellin in Colombia<br>where they committed for church to the<br>needs of the poor and the third event of<br>1968 was the decision by the Jesuit<br>provincials of Latin America to make the<br>social problems of Latin America an<br>absolute priority in our Apostolic<br>strategy<br>following this the 1970s was a decade of<br>development and growth<br>with an initial emphasis up until 1975<br>on economic theory and a political<br>analysis of poverty new things for<br>theologians to be doing<br>but then in the second half of the<br>decade a shift towards a more<br>experiential encounter with poor<br>communities and new directions from this<br>encounter<br>in the 1980s Liberation theology<br>extended its scope and dialogue with<br>other third world theologies as it<br>sought to Bear witness to a god of life<br>in contexts that were often marked by<br>death and suffering<br>during this time it also faced strong<br>opposition from the Vatican and was<br>forced to clarify and refine some of its<br>positions from the early 1970s<br>and in addition there was more attention<br>to spirituality<br>many of the most nuanced Works in<br>Liberation theology date from this<br>period the 1980s<br>finally Liberation theology lost<br>momentum as a movement in the 1990s<br>the end of the Cold War<br>the transition in many Latin American<br>countries from authoritarian regimes<br>back to democracy<br>accompanied by continuing hostility from<br>church authorities<br>created a crisis of Direction<br>important new work was done on issues<br>like the environment but as a church and<br>social movement it now lost its<br>direction and its momentum<br>that said<br>by this time its influence had been<br>absorbed by many faith-based development<br>and this is a practical Legacy that it<br>has continued to leave<br>in addition we might identify three<br>features that are also significant parts<br>first the methodology of the second step<br>Liberation theology demonstrated that<br>you do not always have to start theology<br>with theology<br>you can also start with the realities of<br>life as they are concretely lived out<br>and then seek a deeper understanding of<br>them through careful analysis and then<br>move on to theology as a second step or<br>second act<br>of critical and creative reflection<br>leading to further engagement<br>beckoned the term Liberation and its<br>transformational power as theological<br>language<br>the language of Liberation brought<br>together faith and social action in a<br>powerful way<br>Liberation named what Gutierrez<br>described as three interrelated levels<br>of a single holistic reality in which<br>spirituality Human Experience and<br>politics all came together<br>and the third aspect a preferential<br>option<br>Liberation theology took a theological<br>and ethical decision to land to stand<br>alongside those that it said God had<br>shown a preferential love for<br>especially the world's powerless<br>suppressed and marginalized to see life<br>from their perspective and to make<br>itself accountable to them in a<br>a Liberation Theologian that I became<br>particularly interested in was the best<br>Jesuits John Sabrina<br>Sabrina had arrived in El Salvador as a<br>19 year old in 1957.<br>during the years that followed he left<br>for long periods of theological training<br>in other countries in the Jesuit<br>tradition but he kept returning for<br>short periods and in 1974 he returned<br>for good<br>he was based at the University of<br>Central America in San Salvador which<br>had been founded by the Society of Jesus<br>in 1965 and was known as viuka<br>from the mid-1970s Sabrina worked<br>alongside fellow Spanish Jesuit Ignacio<br>air career at the Yuka and it became a<br>well-known Center of liberation theology<br>sabrino says in a memorable phrase that<br>despite his long theological training it<br>was only after returning to El Salvador<br>in 1974 that he started to awaken from<br>the sleep of inhumanity<br>when he started to confront the<br>realities of poverty oppression and<br>violence experienced in El Salvador<br>and to use this to rethink a<br>distinctively Latin American perspective<br>between 1977 and 1980<br>Aya Korea sabrino and Romero worked<br>together in their thinking on the<br>crucified people<br>this Drew on some Paul's writing on the<br>church as the present body of Christ and<br>perhaps also a little on El Salvador the<br>country's name the savior<br>sabrino's book christology from Latin<br>America published in 1976<br>offers a powerful image of this<br>resemblance representing the whole of<br>Latin America as a christ-like figure on<br>the cross<br>it echoed an idea that the Dominican<br>Friar bald ptolema De Las Casas had in<br>the 16th century when he discerned<br>Christ's presence in the suffering<br>Indians of the Caribbean<br>writing to the Spanish King Las Casas<br>complained that he had seen Jesus Christ<br>Our God scouted and Afflicted and<br>crucified not once but millions of times<br>in the Indies<br>for sabrino the language of a crucified<br>people was relevant to the Salvadoran<br>context in two different ways<br>first there were those who were<br>crucified slowly<br>by structural poverty oppression and<br>exploitation<br>second there were those who were<br>crucified quickly at the hands of death<br>squads and the military if they try to<br>protest the unjust situation<br>as he put it<br>if they resist they are crucified<br>suddenly and violently<br>if they do not resist they are crucified<br>gradually and slowly<br>the risk of a sudden and violent death<br>had been confirmed in the murder of<br>Romero at the start of the decade<br>and in November 1989<br>Aya Korea five other Jesuits the<br>housekeeper and her teenage daughter<br>were executed by a military deaf Squad<br>sabrino only escaped because he had been<br>out of the country at the time<br>in light of these crucifixions both for<br>slow and the sudden<br>sabrino summarized for social tasks<br>before the church as a challenge to take<br>down the victims from the cross<br>a challenge that I will come back to<br>later<br>by the time my book on Liberation<br>theology appeared in 2002 I'd recently<br>started a new job at Trinity College<br>Dublin to establish a new master's<br>degree program in reconciliation studies<br>it was an unusual appointment because<br>instead of working in Dublin in the<br>beautiful and relatively tranquil<br>surroundings of the University<br>the appointment was to live and work in<br>Belfast Northern Ireland<br>so as to be grounded along with the<br>students in a post-conflict society<br>I was interested in exploring the<br>challenges of reconciliation in both<br>political and Theological terms<br>especially because many Liberation<br>theologians viewed reconciliation with<br>suspicion as a distraction from the real<br>issue of liberation<br>but Northern Ireland was its own<br>distinctive context with its own history<br>of Injustice and violence<br>despite the peace process<br>and the Good Friday agreement in 1998 it<br>was still a deeply divided Society<br>with some Catholic and neighborhoods<br>separated by so-called peace walls that<br>stood 10 meters high or taller<br>reconciliation had to be taken as a<br>pressing issue<br>and like the Theology of liberation<br>a socially engaged Theology of<br>reconciliation could make a difference<br>to how people saw themselves and their<br>neighbors<br>our move to Northern Ireland meant<br>learning more about religion politics<br>and conflict in a place that was much<br>closer to home than Latin America but<br>about about which I initially knew very<br>little<br>early in our time in Belfast a kind<br>neighbor was giving me a lift in his car<br>when he pointed across the road and said<br>that's a rough Pub David<br>when you go in there they search you for<br>guns<br>if you don't have one they give you one<br>I think he was probably joking I<br>certainly hope he was<br>but I never went inside to find out<br>Belfast was a much more peaceful place<br>during our time there than it had been<br>during the troubles<br>but they were still quite a high level<br>of violence<br>this loyalist mural on the road where we<br>lived was a reminder of paramilitary<br>presence which was always close by<br>two cases of paramilitary violence<br>during my 13 years there were memorable<br>for different reasons<br>one was a crucifixion in November 2002.<br>of an alleged local Joyrider Harry<br>mccartan in another area of Belfast<br>mccartan was a Catholic who was beaten<br>and nailed to a fence by loyalist<br>paramilitaries<br>possibly as a parody of the crucifix<br>but certainly as a warning to others and<br>as a punishment<br>it was particularly shocking because<br>although he survived it was disturbing<br>in itself and it was also disturbing<br>that at least some people in the area<br>that it happened supported that it had<br>happened<br>another incident was the Murder By<br>Republicans of a local Catholic man<br>Robert McCartney in January 2005.<br>afraka had developed in a pub<br>and on the signal of a senior Republican<br>McCartney had been taken outside into<br>the alley and stabbed<br>an estimated 70 people were in the bar<br>at the time<br>but nobody called an ambulance or the<br>police<br>the murder investigation was hampered by<br>a wall of Silence<br>the before the police could investigate<br>the crime scene the CCTV recordings had<br>been destroyed and the pub forensically<br>cleaned<br>according to newspapers nearly everyone<br>who admitted to being present claimed<br>that they were in the toilets at the<br>time<br>some commentators pointed out that if<br>these claims were to be taken at face<br>value then the prob was probably the<br>only one in the world in which the<br>toilets had the properties of doctored<br>Who's Tardis being much bigger inside<br>the McCartney murder showed how strong<br>the culture of not knowing or at least<br>not saying could still be<br>this slogan in the Catholic neighborhood<br>of short strand which was where<br>McCartney had lived and was home to many<br>of those who have been in the pub<br>was signed notionally with the name p<br>O'Neill<br>this was the name used when the<br>provisional Ira made its official<br>statements<br>the ouster saying whatever you say say<br>nothing which features in the Sheamus<br>Heaney poem was a clear message that it<br>was best to know nothing<br>like the people in the pub in Belfast I<br>suspect many of us find it easier to not<br>know things<br>not knowing or at least not<br>acknowledging seems to be the safe and<br>easy option<br>it allows us to evade responsibilities<br>and not take action<br>by contrast knowing and acknowledging<br>might lead us into action<br>actions involve effort and sometimes<br>risk<br>at otago our University motto is sapare<br>ourode<br>the Latin dare to know<br>and it's often translated as dare to be<br>wise<br>it comes to us<br>from the Roman writer Horus and it was<br>echoed and picked up by the German<br>philosopher Emmanuel Kent<br>it is I think an invitation not just to<br>know things but to be bold and daring in<br>what we know<br>in Horus it is given some extra urgency<br>by the word Incipio a meat at the<br>afterward meaning get started begin<br>for Horus there is a sense of urgency<br>and an encouragement that time should<br>not be lost because knowing things<br>should make a difference to our lives<br>and how we live them<br>in similar spirit this Romero mural<br>features the words of Jesus to the<br>disciples in John 8 32 and you will know<br>the truth and the truth will make you<br>free<br>during the 1990s both El Salvador and<br>Guatemala were working through a peace<br>process and both held truth commissions<br>as part of their peace agreements<br>truth commissions are one way to face up<br>to what are often painful truths about<br>what happened<br>this biblical faith in truth John 8 32<br>alongside James Combs advice to be<br>attentive to what are the questions not<br>being asked<br>and an awareness from Belfast of the<br>pressures to not know that we all feel<br>encouraged me to take a particular<br>interest in the things that we don't<br>want to know<br>drawing on Liberation theology and<br>sabrino's christology of crucified<br>people in particular<br>this has prompted me in my research to<br>look at what we do not want to know<br>about the cross and crucifixion and to<br>because of this some of my research has<br>involved reading the truth commission<br>reports from El Salvador and Guatemala<br>along with torture reports from<br>Argentina Brazil and our Latin American<br>countries<br>and then using these to identify new<br>questions that might be asked about<br>crucifixion<br>in Roman times and in the gospel texts<br>in my article crucifixion State Terror<br>and sexual abuse 1999 I argued for a<br>reading of the Gospel accounts of the<br>stripping and crucifixion of Jesus of<br>Nazareth that explicitly named what<br>happened as a form of sexual abuse<br>this was not because Latin American<br>torch reports or any other documentation<br>or contemporary experience can directly<br>disclose what is in the biblical text<br>or determine its meaning<br>but what a contemporary context can do<br>is to open up a new perspective from<br>which different questions can be asked<br>First Step was to consider whether Roman<br>crucifixion practices in general<br>could be examined more systematically as<br>a form of torture<br>the idea that Roman crucifixions were a<br>form of torture was not particularly<br>original but as far as I know nothing<br>had been done to investigate the<br>implications of this in any depth by<br>studying typical torture practices<br>this seemed like a significant Gap<br>because studies of Latin American<br>torture suggested at least two<br>considerations that might be relevant<br>first to understand the politics of<br>Latin American torture it's necessary to<br>understand that torture was usually<br>directed against a much wider Target<br>than just the individual victim<br>torture in Latin America functioned to<br>intimidate and terrorize the whole<br>society<br>it was not just aimed against the<br>individual<br>second it was striking how common it was<br>for Latin American torture to include<br>sexual humiliations sexual abuses and<br>acts of sexual violence<br>reading Roman writers with an awareness<br>of these two issues confirmed that there<br>is ample evidence in ancient sources<br>that crucifixions functioned as a form<br>of State Terror not just individual<br>punishment<br>that Roman tortures often involve sexual<br>humiliations abuse and violence<br>and that the practice of stripping<br>victims naked for crucifixion was in<br>accordance with the use of crucifixion<br>as a form of torture and this included<br>sexual humiliation which was a form of<br>abuse<br>now if these characteristics were<br>significant for Roman crucifixions in<br>general<br>the next question had to be whether this<br>offered a helpful New Perspective on the<br>crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth in<br>particular<br>and this question provided the starting<br>point for a fresh reading of the Gospel<br>at texts with which we think we are<br>familiar<br>and I argued that the stripping and<br>exposure of Christ on the cross which is<br>clearly attested in the gospels is fully<br>consistent with the Roman use of<br>crucifixion as a form of State Terror<br>involving sexual humiliation and that<br>this should therefore be named as sexual<br>abuse<br>this work was not original in saying<br>that crucifixion was torture and it was<br>not original in saying that Jesus was<br>stripped and crucified naked<br>however it was the first time that these<br>two points were brought together in the<br>context of a wider understanding of<br>torture and sexual humiliation<br>it was also the first time that they<br>have been used to name what should have<br>been self-evident<br>that Jesus was a victim of sexual abuse<br>I say it should be self-evident but my<br>consistent experience since publishing<br>the article is that when people first<br>hear the startling suggestion<br>that Jesus was a victim of sexual abuse<br>they think they have misheard or I am<br>not being serious<br>however they are often quickly persuaded<br>because in many cases they have<br>previously heard that Jesus was<br>crucified naked but they have never<br>heard it called sexual abuse before<br>but when it is hurts when it is named as<br>sexual abuse people say it is so obvious<br>that it is incredible that they have<br>never heard it called that before<br>one reason that it remains a startling<br>idea is that it is still very rare for<br>artists to depict Christ as naked during<br>crucifixion<br>the work of New Zealand artists Colin<br>McCann is unusual in this regard<br>his sequence of works on crucifixion<br>many of which were done in 1947 so it's<br>by no means a new phenomena<br>bring out the element of humiliation in<br>crucifixion in an unavoidable way<br>I suspect that some of you are more<br>familiar with McCann and his work than I<br>am<br>so I would much appreciate to talk to<br>anyone afterwards who has a particular<br>interest in him<br>as you can see this image features a<br>lamp as if to shed light on the darkness<br>of the cross<br>in this image also featuring a lamp he<br>seems to invite us to step up and take a<br>closer look at what is really going on<br>there are two points<br>that are worth drawing out on why naming<br>and representing the cross in terms of<br>sexual abuse is important<br>first the act of naming can create a new<br>relation to a subject<br>and increase control of it<br>as Educators we help students to name<br>experiences in new ways and thereby help<br>them to think more deeply and<br>insightfully about things that they may<br>already know in some way and to some<br>extent but they have not previously had<br>the tools to analyze and reflect upon<br>the role of naming in the Genesis<br>creation story supports this<br>Genesis 1 presents naming as a key part<br>in God's creative process<br>in addition to the power of naming<br>visual representations can make a huge<br>difference of our awareness of issues<br>especially when they give us a human<br>face to what otherwise might be abstract<br>Christian World Service reported today<br>that nearly 4 million people have fled<br>Syria and another 8 million are<br>displaced within the country<br>most of these refugees have taken<br>shelter in neighboring countries<br>last week this crisis was given an<br>individual human face<br>in the photos of Kurdish toddler<br>aylan kurdi<br>he is shown here in the arms of a<br>Turkish police officer<br>after he drowned with his mother and<br>brother as they tried to cross to Turkey<br>across from Turkey to a Greek island of<br>costs<br>there was debate on social media as to<br>whether the image should be shown<br>but there is little doubt that it had a<br>power to move and prompt action and very<br>likely contributed to a greater commit<br>political commitment in Europe to<br>addressing the crisis this week<br>in light of sabrino's theology on taking<br>the crucified down from the cross<br>the image might invite Christians to<br>reflect on weather<br>if refugees stay where they are they are<br>often crucified gradually and slowly<br>if they seek to escape they might be<br>crucified suddenly and violently<br>however churches to respond to those who<br>island in the arms of the police officer<br>might also suggest to Christians the<br>image of the Dead Jesus in the arms of<br>Mary the<br>seen here in McCann's entombment after<br>Titian<br>which presents the women bringing Jesus<br>down from the cross<br>so that his body so could be cared for<br>of course Christians need to remember<br>that speaking of refugees has crucified<br>people in our context in this<br>metaphorical way can be misunderstood<br>and great care will be needed if it is<br>to be done respectfully and<br>appropriately<br>however sabrino's work encourages us to<br>think more about whether and how this<br>the legacy of Liberation theology can<br>also provide inspiration in another area<br>of research that I am currently<br>exploring in relation to victims of<br>does the naming does naming crucifixion<br>as a form of sexual abuse and naming<br>Jesus as a victim of sexual abuse change<br>the sense that survivors of abuse have<br>of Christ and the cross and or their<br>sense of themselves<br>if naming Christ and the cross more<br>explicitly in terms of sexual abuse can<br>be a positive and healing process for<br>survivors<br>it would suggest that churches could be<br>far more active in this issue and in<br>future than they have been in the past<br>since 2010 tier fund a uk-based faith<br>development agency has been involved in<br>building National and Global movements<br>with churches and other partners<br>in a coalition called we will speak out<br>and it's published two significant<br>reports silent no more 2011 and breaking<br>the silence 2013.<br>based on Research at the University of<br>Stellenbosch South Africa which is one<br>of our partners in the global Network<br>for public theology<br>one of the key findings in the reports<br>is that survivors of sexual abuses<br>identify the churches as the<br>institutions for the best place to help<br>them<br>yet they also report that the church all<br>too often fails to respond to their<br>needs and this is partly because the<br>church does not cease sexual abuse as a<br>this lack of interest from the church<br>often reinforces for shame stigma and<br>silence that survivors are struggling<br>with it's worse than useless it deepens<br>the problem<br>as one Survivor is quoted as saying in<br>Breaking the silence<br>I choose to die silently<br>you're too scared to talk about it and<br>you don't know who to tell<br>If This Were to change if sexual abuse<br>came to be seen as a central element in<br>the Christian understanding of the cross<br>and the experience of Christ was named<br>in these terms it could make an enormous<br>difference to how the churches respond<br>to sexual abuse and how some of the most<br>vulnerable and victimized people feel<br>about themselves and are treated with<br>dignity by others<br>breaking the silence suggests that the<br>churches in South Africa could take very<br>modest and practical actions to help<br>survivors in big ways<br>for example<br>it mentions a willingness of church<br>members to accompany those who go to<br>police stations to report that they have<br>been abused<br>a small act but an important way to<br>assist the person concerns<br>to signal that the church takes the<br>issue seriously<br>and to indicate to the police that the<br>incident should not be dismissed or<br>trivialized as a purely Private Matter<br>in some cases survivors might even<br>experience this small solidarity and<br>support as being helped down from a<br>so this evening<br>I've tried to speak to three areas<br>first some of my own encounter with<br>Liberation theology<br>and what it's meant to me at a personal<br>level<br>second<br>what made Liberation theology<br>distinctive and how it developed and<br>grew as a movement<br>I have identified three elements that I<br>think are crucial to this and which<br>shaped it as a theological Enterprise<br>and movement<br>the methodology of the second step<br>the transformative power of the term<br>liberation<br>and what this continues to show us about<br>the importance of language and how we<br>name things in bringing them together in<br>new ways<br>and the preferential option it made for<br>the poor and marginalized<br>finally I concluded<br>with an example of how insights and<br>Inspirations from Liberation theology<br>might contribute to the church's<br>response to the refugee crisis<br>and how it also shapes my own research<br>on a Christian response to torture and<br>sexual abuse<br>thank you for coming<br>if you are already familiar with<br>Liberation theology<br>I hope I have offered what you see as a<br>fair account<br>if it's new to you<br>I hope this evening will make you want<br>to do what I did first when I picked up<br>gutierrez's book in Black Horse Bookshop<br>and you will want to read more<br>Liberation theology from yourself<br>and decide on what you think it has to<br>offer<br>and if you do please be sure to let me<br>know thank you<br>thank you very much Professor tombs well<br>Liberation theology as a movement may as<br>you say have have come to an end in the<br>1990s you've reminded us in your lecture<br>that Liberation in all its forms remains<br>a very vital concern for many people uh<br>the world over<br>you've also demonstrated the role that<br>public theology can play in challenging<br>us and our churches to face up to issues<br>and indeed to images that we would<br>rather turn our faces away from whether<br>from sexual violence and domestic abuse<br>which in New Zealand is perhaps rather<br>more often hidden than public or from<br>the much more public suffering of<br>refugees in the Mediterranean<br>I would say that I I would confess that<br>I often find reading theology rather<br>difficult but reading David's theology I<br>found difficult in a very different way<br>in the kind of unflinching focus that<br>you placed on very difficult aspects of<br>the his history of of the churches in<br>and the Revolutions in in Central<br>America but also in re-reading the<br>gospels through those through those<br>lenses<br>so you have made a great start in<br>addressing these these issues both in<br>your lecture tonight and also in the<br>events that the center has already<br>organized um under your leadership and<br>we look forward to hearing much more uh<br>both through these events and also<br>through your published work and the work<br>of students and staff associated with<br>the center for now please accept us at<br>gift as a token of our appreciation for<br>your lecture and for the work that you<br>do</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
