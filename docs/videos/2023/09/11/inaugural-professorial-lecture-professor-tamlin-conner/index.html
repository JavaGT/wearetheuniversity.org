achievements<br>I'd especially like to welcome Dr<br>Connor's family<br>joining us in person is her partner<br>David and his son Graham welcome<br>and on the live Zoom is her mother<br>Patricia and a sizable number of a<br>California family including cousins<br>aunts and uncles<br>I'm very glad you're able to share this<br>very special occasion with us<br>it's not easy to become a professor at<br>the University of otago<br>the title of Professor is reserved for<br>the highest achieving academics<br>it takes ability commitment and hard<br>work to become a professor<br>you need to be able to demonstrate that<br>you're a leader in your field of<br>research<br>an outstanding teacher in that you are<br>providing significant service to the<br>academic and broader community<br>as you're here tonight Dr Connor has<br>clearly earned the title of Professor<br>congratulations<br>I first met Tamlin 12 years ago when we<br>co-supervised a PhD student together<br>her intellect and ability and more<br>importantly her support for our students<br>were evident to me then and I'm very<br>delighted to be the host for inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>I'm also very much looking forward to<br>learning more about what must be one of<br>the most uplifting research topics on<br>campus<br>investigating what makes people healthy<br>and happy<br>I'd like to now invite The Brew Vice<br>Chancellor of the vision of science<br>Professor Richard Barker to introduce<br>Professor Bremer denaque<br>Professor Connor tianakwe<br>Professor helbishta tenakue Graham Tim<br>tinakwe friends and colleagues tenakoto<br>tenakoto tenakoto kotoa it is my great<br>pleasure to introduce our speaker<br>tonight Professor Tamlin Connor from the<br>Department of psychology to give her<br>inaugural professorial lecture at the<br>University of otago<br>is indicated by Professor Bremer Tamlin<br>was promoted to Professor in February of<br>this year and tonight we get to<br>celebrate the significant achievement<br>Professor Connor grew up in California<br>by the beach and in the Sun and after<br>attending Corona del Mar High School she<br>headed off to the University of Colorado<br>Colorado Boulder where she majored in<br>Psychology with a minor in philosophy<br>graduated<br>magna Lauda before heading across<br>the continent to Boston College where<br>she received her PhD in 2003.<br>interestingly Tamlin started as a<br>journalism major<br>she hated the short deadlines and the<br>pace of it and wanted something slower<br>and that would allow her to engage more<br>deeply into understanding people so she<br>moved to psychology and I guess the<br>university is a perfect place for<br>someone who doesn't like fast pace and<br>deadlines<br>tamlin's PhD was followed by a series of<br>academic appointments first as a<br>teaching assistant professor in the<br>department of psychology at Boston<br>College followed by a postdoctoral<br>fellowship in Psychiatry at the<br>University of Connecticut school of<br>medicine before migrating across the<br>Pacific to join us as a lecturer in<br>2008.<br>he's been here ever since<br>and now just about a decade and a half<br>later we celebrate her impressive rise<br>through the academic ranks from lecturer<br>to full professor<br>as we've heard from Professor Bremer<br>promotion to full professor at the<br>University of otago is far from easy and<br>you must excel in all of the academic<br>domains of teaching research and service<br>Professor Connor has truly excelled<br>who research is both prolific<br>and impactful<br>she has more than 100 peer-reviewed<br>published outputs and if I can borrow<br>from her hod's helpful comments on a<br>proposed promotion application she works<br>at the Forefront of two hot areas in the<br>field one methodological and one topical<br>Tamlin is a world-leading expert on<br>experience sampling these are<br>longitudinal measurements involving<br>daily self-report by individual<br>participants going about their daily<br>lives also known as ambulatory<br>assessment she has literally written the<br>book on this<br>with her expertise she has advised<br>thousands of other researchers in<br>diverse Fields her own specialty well<br>suited to experience sampling is<br>subjective well-being itself an<br>increasingly important area in terms of<br>theory and public policy<br>many societies including our own have<br>begun to measure the health of their<br>economies not only in economic terms but<br>also in Social ones and tamlin's work<br>will be at The Cutting Edge in terms of<br>quantifying this well-being economy<br>Professor Connor is also an outstanding<br>teacher<br>and at the time of her promotion<br>application her hod remarked on her<br>extended and consistent history of<br>teaching commitment Innovation and<br>Leadership her teaching includes two<br>popular papers psych 422 contemporary<br>issues and psychology and psych 324<br>Health psychology and in these she<br>provides her signature one-on-one speed<br>back writing feedback and Innovation<br>that she has shared with her colleagues<br>here at the University in our higher<br>education development center and also in<br>international workshops<br>she is a popular and award-winning<br>supervisor and since joining the<br>university in 2008 has supervised 16 PhD<br>students 14 Master students and 23<br>honors students 53 in all if you were<br>keeping up<br>two of her PhD students had their Theses<br>recognized as exceptional doctoral<br>Theses and the division of Sciences<br>her teaching has been recognized by<br>Awards and this goes right back to the<br>beginning when she started as a teacher<br>at Boston College where she won a<br>graduate student teaching Excellence<br>award and then at otago in 2009 she was<br>a nominee for the otago University<br>Students Association teaching award in<br>2015 was nominated for the outstanding<br>student support award advising and<br>mentoring award by the division of<br>Sciences here at the University in 2017<br>she was awarded supervisor of the Year<br>within the division of Sciences and the<br>otago universities uh<br>in the division of Sciences by the otago<br>university Students Association and in<br>2018 was a nominee for the otago<br>University Students Association teaching<br>the final academic domain in which staff<br>must Excel to be promoted as service<br>within the department Tamlin has had a<br>number of roles including as Chief<br>advisor of studies for most of the past<br>decade and she established largely on<br>her own the first student Society in the<br>department of psychology outside the<br>department she chairs the University of<br>otago research grants social human and<br>Behavioral Sciences panel as a member of<br>our research committee<br>and there's also a panel member of the<br>royal society's Marsden assessment panel<br>for economics and human and Behavioral<br>Sciences<br>she's a proposal assessor for mbie<br>recognized for her leadership potential<br>in<br>2022 last year she Tamlin was a delegate<br>for the team manahua New Zealand woman<br>and Leadership Academic Program just one<br>of two women's faculty selected from the<br>University of otago<br>based on their experience their<br>aspiration and their capacity for senior<br>leadership positions in Academia<br>I think you've heard enough from me it's<br>now time to hear from Professor Connor<br>herself one of our fabulous women in<br>science here at the University of otago<br>please join me in welcoming Professor<br>Tamlin Connor<br>so I've given a lot of talks in my life<br>and when I when I gave my first talk my<br>dad who did a lot of public speaking he<br>said Tamlin if you're nervous just the<br>first thing that you need to do is take<br>a sip of water so I'm going to do that<br>right now<br>and the first time I did that at my<br>first scientific talk poured the<br>contents of the water entirely down the<br>front of me<br>so I've managed to not do that right now<br>thanks so much for coming I'm going to<br>are you happy<br>this may seem like a simple question a<br>simple question with a simple answer but<br>what I hope to show you today is that<br>the factors that can contribute to our<br>happiness are far more complex<br>and in fact they are rich and varied<br>and your happiness may even be impacted<br>by what you eat including this apple<br>so today I want to share with you my<br>research on Pathways to well-being<br>what does my research say about how to<br>be happier focusing on modifiable<br>lifestyle habits that improve or impede<br>well-being<br>and I would like to dedicate my lecture<br>to four people who have been influential<br>in my life thus far<br>I'm going to try not to cry<br>you have enriched my life immensely and<br>challenged me to be a better and broader<br>my mother Patricia Connor<br>who nurtured my own heart as I developed<br>she nurtured my love for reading and<br>organization<br>and you are my biggest cheerleader and I<br>and my late father<br>Charles P Connor for instilling in me<br>the importance of Education<br>now he was a businessman by profession<br>but in his heart he was an educator and<br>a mentor<br>and his advice to me was always<br>Tam eat the big frog first<br>and I didn't know it at the time but it<br>turns out this is a Mark Twain quote who<br>wrote if it's your job to eat a frog<br>it's best to do it first thing in the<br>morning and if it's your job to eat two<br>frogs it's best to eat the biggest one<br>first<br>well Dad I have eaten a lot of frogs<br>and I'm dedicating this particular frog<br>now I'll confess if you had met me<br>as an adolescent Growing Up in Southern<br>California in the 1980s you might not<br>have thought that I would be a professor<br>in the 2020s<br>even my first scientific poster I<br>interest how<br>Cent were there even<br>at first I was curious I wanted to know<br>about people and how they acted in their<br>worlds and I would even go out and and<br>spend time people watching and just to<br>see how people acted<br>and then the second thing is I had an<br>intense desire not to go into my<br>father's escrow business<br>so I undertook an undergraduate my<br>undergraduate degree which is a Bachelor<br>of Arts at the University of Colorado at<br>Boulder I tend to go to universities in<br>very beautiful places Boulder is one of<br>after a couple of years of<br>soul-searching major switching as<br>Richard mentioned starting out in<br>journalism and not liking the time frame<br>of it I decided to major in Psychology<br>and follow my curiosity of people in<br>their psychological lives<br>and I was fortunate to complete an<br>honors thesis with Professor Lou Harvey<br>at the time and we did a really<br>interesting project on perception<br>without awareness the idea that you<br>could be influenced by processes outside<br>of your awareness and I learned a lot of<br>things from Lou at that time one of them<br>was that I actually had capacity for<br>academic work and I didn't know that up<br>to up to that point<br>and then the other was that you could be<br>a professor and still maintain your<br>now like most psychology students<br>I have been saving these pictures my<br>like most psychology students I<br>considered Clinical Psychology<br>and<br>um because that's what you do when<br>you're a Psychology major you say okay<br>I'm going to go into Clinical Psychology<br>so I did what I advise my students to do<br>which is to place yourself in that<br>working situation in that environment<br>where you think you want to work in<br>so I I did just that<br>right before I graduated I went to work<br>at a psychiatric hospital just outside<br>of Denver I was a behavioral technician<br>and um and it was<br>one of the worst jobs I've ever had in<br>my entire life it was terrible<br>and aside from lighting residents<br>cigarettes this was what we did in the<br>1990s<br>I didn't see at all how anything that I<br>was doing was helping the residents to<br>lead Better Lives<br>I also at the time tried out for a<br>peer-to-peer psychological help hotline<br>at Boulder and in a mock call<br>absolutely said the wrong things<br>and was told quite clearly in the end<br>that I was ill-suited to counseling<br>so so at that time I thought okay right<br>I was a little devastated but the<br>universe was trying to Signal something<br>to me and maybe that signal was that<br>maybe I should not go into Clinical<br>Psychology now at the same time I was<br>teaching students I had a I was a<br>teaching assistant for introduction to<br>psychology and I had a class of 30<br>students and I got to teach them things<br>I got to engage them in discussion and I<br>really enjoyed it and I it turns out<br>that I was much better at teaching than<br>I was counseling<br>So I listened to my heart I assessed my<br>strengths and my weaknesses and decided<br>that I think I could be a university<br>professor<br>and now here I am<br>so I decided how do you become a<br>professor how do you teach University<br>while you get your PhD so I decided to<br>do my PhD and I wanted to do something<br>that wasn't Clinical Psychology but<br>still involved people so I went and did<br>a PHD in social psychology at Boston<br>College<br>now during my PhD the hard work of<br>cultivating my mind began<br>and I did my PhD in Boston College with<br>Professor Lisa Feldman Barrett and Lisa<br>turned out to be an outstanding choice<br>because she is one of the smartest and<br>most accomplished psychological<br>scientists of the 21st Century<br>she taught me how to write well she<br>taught me how to think well<br>and she taught me how to be resilient in<br>the face of challenge<br>lots of challenges<br>and it was during my PhD that I<br>developed an appreciation for doing<br>psychological research outside of the<br>laboratory to capture life as it's lived<br>inspired by the work of my PhD<br>supervisor at the time and what was then<br>a really Innovative technology which now<br>looks so ancient Palm top computers<br>personal digital assistants I mean this<br>even pre-dece<br>came before Blackboard back blackberries<br>and so this would eventually lead to<br>what we use today what everybody has in<br>their pocket the smartphone<br>and so as Richard mentioned I developed<br>an expertise in the experience sampling<br>method which involves using this<br>technology to Signal people in real time<br>over time in people's natural<br>environments and to doing using this<br>technology you can capture a lot of Rich<br>detailed information for example a<br>person's emotional signature of how<br>happy they feel over the course of here<br>13 days this is actual data from from a<br>person in one of my studies<br>so some of the earliest and first<br>Publications I did in graduate school<br>applied these types of methods to<br>understanding people's daily lives<br>and in one publication<br>I used a once daily diary method to<br>track people to have people report on<br>their emotional experiences at the end<br>of every day for seven days and then<br>after remember how they reported feeling<br>showing that people higher in<br>self-esteem remember their experiences<br>as being much more positive than they<br>another study<br>another study showed that some of the<br>associations that we may hold about<br>ourselves that are outside of our<br>conscious awareness may affect how we<br>feel in the ebb and flow of our daily<br>lives<br>suggesting hidden a hidden vulnerability<br>and this work actually built off of the<br>undergraduate thesis that I did with Lou<br>Harvey reflecting my interest in<br>now in fact my my interest in<br>understanding people in their natural<br>environments<br>is informed by my entire academic<br>lineage which I only figured out<br>recently that you can actually see The<br>Echoes of this perspective and approach<br>of measuring people in their<br>environments all the way back so it's<br>informed not only by the work of my<br>supervisor Lisa Feldman Barrett on her<br>work on experienced emotion and her<br>supervisor Michael Michael Ross on the<br>science of self-reports but his academic<br>grandfather<br>Kurt Lewin and my academic great great<br>grandfather Kurt Lewin who is the famous<br>German American Scholar noted founder of<br>social psychology and developer of the<br>famous Lumen equation which held that<br>behavior is a function of the person in<br>their environment<br>and this equation places special<br>importance on understanding how a person<br>is functioning and how they're being<br>influenced by their immediate context<br>and and the think the thinking of this<br>equation is that you cannot understand a<br>person by extracting them out of their<br>environment to really understand a<br>person you have to see how they how<br>they're behaving and functioning in<br>their naturalistic settings and that's<br>exactly what I'm continuing on to this<br>day<br>now little did I know that my<br>methodology training with Lisa would<br>evolve into a full-blown academic<br>identity literally as the expert in<br>experience sampling method starting with<br>my primer a practical guide to<br>experience sampling pursuited very very<br>direct title a primer about experience<br>sampling message which I wrote during my<br>PhD and followed by several invited<br>methodology articles a theory article<br>and ultimately leading to my co-editing<br>the handbook of research methods for<br>studying daily life with my fabulous<br>co-editor Matthias Mel with help of<br>now my research career was also<br>influenced by my postdoctoral fellowship<br>with Professor Howard tennan at the<br>University of Connecticut medical school<br>and here I expand in my research on<br>social psychology shifting it to<br>understanding Health which included<br>young adult alcohol use the emotional<br>experience of patient populations for<br>example people with rheumatoid arthritis<br>and also doing some work on genetic<br>predictors of alcohol use and emotional<br>experience now this postdoc was<br>influential for for two reasons and the<br>first is that I discovered my love of<br>interdisciplinary research the idea of<br>combining research from one field and<br>combining that and applying that to<br>another so in this case applying some of<br>the methods that I learned in social<br>psychology and applying that within<br>Psychiatry health and even genetics<br>and some of the research that I<br>published during this time focused on<br>understanding the daily lived emotional<br>experiences of people with chronic<br>chronic health conditions so for example<br>here we did a study looking at people<br>with rheumatoid arthritis pain<br>and found that those people who had a<br>history of depression who had arthritis<br>pain their emotions were much more<br>strongly tied to their pain than people<br>without a history of depression<br>suggesting that that formerly depressed<br>people manage and cope with their their<br>pain differently from people without a<br>history of depression other research<br>during this time looked at how certain<br>genetic variants related to serotonin<br>function predict differences in people's<br>daily emotional states modulate how how<br>anxiously they react to daily stressors<br>and how these genetic polymorphisms even<br>interact with stressful life events to<br>predict their likelihood of alcohol and<br>now the second reason that this postdoc<br>was very influential is that it helped<br>me secure my dream job here at the<br>University of otago yay Department of<br>psychology and what a great Department<br>this is<br>I'm a huge otago champion because I have<br>outstanding colleagues and I have<br>outstanding students and now outstanding<br>friends I arrived in 2008 and started my<br>own lab here called The Daily<br>now one of the first projects that I did<br>was actually a very surprising project<br>because I didn't start out researching<br>fruit and vegetable intake<br>although I think it's fitting that I<br>have moved into this field because it<br>turns out that I am turning into my<br>mother because my mother is a<br>nutritionist or was a nutritionist so I<br>now at the time when I first arrived<br>here uh<br>Kate Berard our outstanding research<br>advisor from the division of Sciences<br>put me in touch with Caroline Horwath<br>then in the department of human<br>nutrition and we decided that we'd<br>co-supervise a master's student right in<br>that first year that I arrived and we<br>were going to do a project to look at<br>stress-related eating<br>the idea that to test the hypothesis<br>that do people eat worse food<br>unhealthier food when they're stressed<br>so I ran a daily diary study of 300<br>students who at the end of every day for<br>21 days reported on their their<br>stressors that day their mood their<br>well-being their healthy foods their<br>unhealthy Foods I mean it was a really<br>large survey we asked a lot of questions<br>and then our goal was to test whether<br>people ate more on healthy foods on high<br>when we analyze the data<br>we did not find any evidence of that at<br>all there was actually no connection<br>between stress and eating which was<br>actually really surprising at the time<br>it went against some literature that<br>suggests we would find that but an<br>interesting signal<br>stood out in the data<br>that we weren't expecting and we hadn't<br>seen before and that was there was a<br>unique coupling between people's intake<br>of fruits and vegetables and their<br>reports of happiness or more broadly<br>positive affect so reports of Happiness<br>excitement energy enthusiasm<br>and this is what the data found<br>so the more daily servings of fruits and<br>vegetables people are eating the higher<br>their positive affect<br>not only do people who eat more fruits<br>and vegetables feel happier but on days<br>when people ate more fruits and<br>vegetables than they usually did they<br>felt happier than they usually do<br>so we found this at the between person<br>level and at the within person level<br>not only that oh and this Association<br>occurred regardless of gender age<br>ethnicity socioeconomic status and even<br>now this is just an association so we<br>tried to tease out what comes first is<br>it the mood that comes first and the<br>mood predicts the the food or is it the<br>food that comes first and that predicts<br>your mood and when we did some lagged<br>statistical analyzes we found that it<br>was the food that seemed to be driving<br>the mood and not the other way around<br>we published this finding in the British<br>Journal of Health psychology which has<br>like good psychological scientists<br>though we need to replicate this finding<br>so in the next study that I ran again a<br>large daily diary study this pattern<br>kept emerging<br>here in a data set of 500 people again<br>we found that people who ate more fruits<br>and vegetables reported not only higher<br>positive affect but greater flourishing<br>which refers to a state of well-being<br>characterized by feelings of Engagement<br>meaning and purpose<br>again we see this at the between person<br>level and at the within person level so<br>when people eat better than they<br>normally do they feel better than they<br>and this research provided one of the<br>first pieces of evidence that what we<br>eat May influence not only our physical<br>health but also our mental health as<br>well<br>This research also led to a very<br>embarrassing a rather large front page<br>ad uh thing on The otago Daily Times<br>saying uh with a very very large picture<br>here featured with carrots this is<br>actually a compromise they wanted me to<br>to model other kinds of fruits but I we<br>decided to compromise on carrots here<br>that healthy food equals lighter mood<br>so why<br>why might there be this association<br>between fruits and vegetables and<br>greater well-being well there's there<br>may be biologically plausible mechanisms<br>linking the two<br>fruits and vegetables contain a variety<br>of<br>micronutrients critical to mental and<br>physical function<br>they contain antioxidants like vitamin c<br>e and carotenoids which reduce bodily<br>inflammation which we know inflammation<br>is bad for mood<br>vitamin C B and complex carbs are also<br>cofactors in the production of dopamine<br>now dopamine is a neurotransmitter that<br>some have argued not only underly<br>feelings of motivation but also a zest<br>for life<br>which sounds very similar to well-being<br>and at this stage my research had<br>contributed to that strong correlational<br>evidence linking the two but there was<br>not any causal evidence because research<br>had not yet done intervention trials to<br>see whether there may be a causal<br>relationship<br>so that's what I set out to do next is<br>to do intervention research to see if we<br>can change people's diet dietary<br>patterns and test the impacts to their<br>well-being<br>the first and I'm going to tell you<br>about two interventions today so the<br>first intervention was the let them eat<br>fruit study which formed the basis of<br>Kate Brookie's PhD thesis and<br>represented my first collaboration with<br>Marguerite viscers my the vitamin C<br>researcher from the University of otago<br>Christchurch campus<br>and we ran a pre-registered two-week<br>intervention so it was a relatively<br>brief intervention to test whether<br>increasing young adults fruit and<br>vegetable intake would promote<br>improvements to their well-being we had<br>three conditions<br>so we randomized people to either a diet<br>as usual control group where we didn't<br>intervene in their diet<br>and ecological momentary intervention<br>condition which is just a messaging<br>condition where we sent them targeted<br>messages to remember to eat your fruits<br>and vegetables and try to incorporate it<br>into your diet today and we also gave<br>them money we gave them a voucher to<br>purchase fruits and vegetables too<br>so removing that barrier and then the<br>third condition was<br>a straight up fruit and vegetable<br>condition where we gave them the fruits<br>and vegetables to eat and on top of<br>their normal diet<br>and then across the 14 days we use<br>smartphone tracking of their<br>self-reported fruit and vegetable intake<br>their mood and their well-being so this<br>study this study was really fun to run<br>because Kate would be pushing trolleys<br>of fruit and vegetables from Veggie boys<br>and so yeah it was really quite fun fun<br>and what did we find did we find any<br>evidence that there's a causal<br>relationship<br>and in fact we did<br>that those in the fruit and vegetable<br>condition here the lines shown in Black<br>reported significant improvements to<br>their well-being over the 14 days so<br>using growth curve modeling we could<br>show that the trajectory of well-being<br>for this group was increasing whereas<br>the other two groups didn't show any<br>so the messages didn't work<br>but providing them with the food did<br>and this research was one of the first<br>studies using a randomized design<br>to suggest a causal effect of increasing<br>fruit and vegetable intake on changes to<br>well-being and the change change wasn't<br>small either was about a like a 12 to 15<br>increase in well-being as a function of<br>this also led to a<br>intense scrutiny on a Reddit science<br>sub-thread<br>that yielded some valid uh observations<br>about nutritional psychology research<br>more broadly and our trial design so one<br>per and some of them are kind of funny<br>but some of them actually they have very<br>good points so another Finding of this<br>study is that nagging people to eat more<br>fruits and vegetables is ineffective at<br>improving their health this finding is<br>robust even to the extreme levels of<br>nagging engaged in by the researchers<br>Fair Point<br>next person said so they found that<br>giving some giving people some free<br>gifts every day makes them happy while<br>telling them to get their own damn food<br>makes them sad<br>maybe if they handed them some<br>hamburgers they would be even happier<br>or I wonder how much of this is the<br>placebo fruits are good for me I can<br>feel the difference good point and<br>finally what do you mean eating scores<br>of processed non-food garbage is bad for<br>so on the basis of this criticism and<br>some valid concerns about how do we use<br>how do we actively control for Placebo<br>effects in a dietary trial<br>and we weren't too depressed to stop<br>persisting in this research we decided<br>to run an even larger trial called the<br>QVC for Vitality trial<br>and this is the second intervention that<br>I'll tell you about<br>so this this work<br>form the basis of Ben pletcher's PhD and<br>continued my collaboration with with<br>Marguerite vissers and then we also had<br>thank goodness a biostatistician join<br>our team Jill Hazard to help us analyze<br>our data actually properly thank you<br>Jill<br>and this work was funded by zesbury the<br>kiwifruit company and consistent of an<br>eight-week trial where we recruited<br>adults with adults who didn't consume<br>very many fruits and vegetables so they<br>had really low blood vitamin blood<br>levels of vitamin C we recruited them we<br>ran them randomized them into three<br>groups so um one group ate two Sun gold<br>kiwi fruits every day for four weeks the<br>other group another group got the<br>equivalent amount of vitamin C in a<br>tablet and then the third group was a<br>placebo group that they had a placebo<br>tablet that looked and smelled and<br>tasted exactly like the vitamin C tablet<br>so we could try to control for some of<br>the psychological expectancies of<br>getting a vitamin C tablet in this in<br>this study<br>and we track their mood and well-being<br>across the eight week period and what we<br>found was<br>following the introduction of the<br>intervention here shown in weeks two<br>four and six you can see that<br>participants in the kiwi fruit and the<br>vitamin C condition here shown in green<br>and orange showed significant increases<br>in their well-being scores relative to<br>and what this finding suggested to us is<br>one this vitamin C might be one of the<br>biochemical mechanisms underlying the<br>link between fruit and vegetable intake<br>and well-being and it also suggests that<br>we're restoring optimal vitamin C levels<br>in people who have low Vitamin C May<br>Elevate their feelings of well-being in<br>now within this kiwi fruit study my PhD<br>student Ben used high resolution<br>smartphone surveys and so he's the one<br>who managed all this and it was really<br>difficult in this trial<br>we used high resolution smartphone<br>surveys of daily well-being so we had<br>them complete a survey every other day<br>through this entire eight-week trial to<br>look at the more fine-grained temporal<br>resolution in terms of their changes in<br>well-being over time and day zero here<br>in this graph is when they got the kiwi<br>fruit or the vitamin C or the placebo<br>tablets and that and you can see there<br>was some there was small changes you can<br>actually start to see the emergence of<br>mood changes even as early as days four<br>to six into the intervention<br>and then it dipped down a little bit<br>around day 10 but then came up day 14.<br>so this type of research of using this<br>intensive micro longitudinal data data<br>Gathering isn't done very much in<br>nutritional research but it is done a<br>lot in social psychology so merging the<br>two you can see the value of the value<br>so other discoveries in the nutrition<br>and psychology space that I've been<br>doing include understanding the role of<br>vitamin D in mood with my then PhD<br>student Maria shaukri and her<br>co-supervisor Lisa Houghton and also<br>other team team-based projects looking<br>at how optimal levels of blood iron and<br>selenium contribute to to mood<br>led by my then Master student Amy<br>Richardson with her co-supervisor team<br>Anne Louise Heath and Jody Miller also<br>and my current research in this area is<br>evolving to look at how diet intersects<br>with other types of Health behaviors<br>because we know that diet itself doesn't<br>just occur in a vacuum there's other<br>types of Health Healthy Lifestyles that<br>we can lead how will we exercise how<br>much we sleep<br>so with my then Master student Shay<br>Wickham who is now a PhD student<br>supervised by Rachel Taylor and Jill<br>Hazard and myself as a third<br>co-supervisor<br>we Shea and I published a study a few<br>years ago where we called diet exercise<br>and sleep the big three Health behaviors<br>and published a study showing how all<br>three make important contributions to<br>people's well-beings so we're we're<br>continuing this research using looking<br>at other projects<br>and then more recently my current PhD<br>student Jack Cooper co-supervised by<br>Robin Turner also in biostatistics we're<br>tracking people's big three Health<br>behaviors through both smartphone<br>surveys and wearable devices<br>so like fitbits and other types of<br>technology and modeling their relative<br>impact to daily well-being finding that<br>that again all of three of these<br>behaviors are important<br>Protectors of daily well-being and they<br>might have interesting synergistic<br>effects<br>now alongside these Health behaviors my<br>work is focused on three other<br>modifiable behaviors that predict<br>well-being<br>first nature so being with being in<br>nature work with my PhD student izuro<br>satu and our collaborator Paul Jones<br>from Victoria University of Wellington<br>we ran several dearly diary studies<br>where we asked people to what extent<br>they did they'd been in nature today and<br>we found that well-being was higher on<br>days when people spent 20 minutes in<br>nature and highest on days in which they<br>spent 60 Minutes in nature<br>and then also I'm not showing you this<br>but when we intervene we did an<br>intervention study to randomize people<br>to walk in the City versus walk in<br>nature so go do an hour walk in in the<br>City versus in the nature well-being was<br>second practicing mindfulness<br>work with my PhD student Jade Flett and<br>her co-supervisory team myself harleen<br>Hayne and Tess Patterson we've run<br>several Trials of popular mindfulness<br>apps so mindfulness apps have become<br>very popular in the past past years<br>but do they work so let's put it to the<br>scientific test and what we found is yes<br>they do work<br>but they only work when people use the<br>apps and do they use the apps no they<br>don't use the apps<br>they download them they use them for a<br>few days but then after that they stop<br>using them but if you ask them if they<br>use them they say that they use them<br>so we also published a paper on the poor<br>the Peril of self-reported ear adherence<br>and digital interventions a brief<br>example<br>and the last modifiable behavior that<br>I'll tell you about today is<br>engaging in one's creativity<br>and I'm not talking about Big C<br>creativity that's associated with Master<br>works of Genius where you have to<br>dedicate your life to your craft and you<br>know you go to school for it or you're<br>an artiste no I'm talking about little<br>seats little C or everyday creativity<br>that's associated with small things that<br>we do in our daily lives that can tap<br>into I mean it's it's similar to my<br>other research and then it's like micro<br>level creativity little things like<br>drawing painting playing music writing<br>designing colorful slides for a talk<br>and even baking<br>and this work was inspired by the visits<br>of two William Evans fellows to otago<br>Paul Sylvia and Colin Young<br>and across two daily diary studies we<br>observe that on days in which people<br>reported being more creative their<br>well-being was higher<br>and then when we tried to tease out<br>which comes first does does being<br>creative promote future feelings of<br>well-being or is it that<br>feelings of well-being<br>promote future feelings of creativity<br>which way is it<br>well when we analyze the data we found<br>that it's the creativity that predicts<br>predicts changes in well-being and not<br>and this too has led to some interesting<br>headlines particularly during the<br>pandemic when people were baking a lot<br>at home so feeling down<br>scientists say cooking and baking could<br>help you feel better a little creativity<br>each day goes a long way<br>but of course any benefit of baking the<br>cupcakes is if you eat them this is the<br>problem it's going to increase your<br>levels of inflammation which is going to<br>impair your mood so it probably just<br>now my research is not just about<br>modifiable habits for happiness it also<br>continues to understand the emotional<br>lives of special populations of people<br>and the two that I want to highlight<br>here is work that Phil mentioned we did<br>on people with food allergies so looking<br>at what are some of the challenges that<br>people living with food allergies face<br>in their daily lives and this is work<br>led by our PhD student Rana Penny Amina<br>with Miranda morosa and Phil Bremer in<br>food science<br>and here we tracked people's experiences<br>and challenges of living with food<br>allergies over time in their daily lives<br>and one of the interesting findings that<br>we found is that we found a Personnel<br>that that people with a particular<br>personality trait of being higher in<br>openness to experience they had the most<br>challenges of coping with their food<br>allergies in everyday life<br>and it looks like the demands of coping<br>with a food allergy requiring caution<br>routine consumption of known Foods is in<br>direct conflict with their personality<br>traits that that crave exploration<br>variety and novel experiences including<br>novel Foods<br>so it's an interesting conflict between<br>the personality and the demands of<br>coping with that and the consequence to<br>their emotions<br>with um I've also done research on<br>people living with rheumatoid arthritis<br>with our PhD student Rasheen hegarty my<br>collaborator Garrett traharn and Simon<br>stebbings from the Department of<br>Medicine Gareth from psychology of<br>course this has yielded some pretty<br>interesting interesting insights into<br>how people cope with experiencing pain<br>and fatigue in their daily lives<br>and we showed that not surprisingly when<br>people experience fatigue<br>through their rheumatoid arthritis this<br>has significant impairments to their<br>mood States<br>but that people who can be more mindful<br>in their daily lives or engage in<br>personally meaningful activities whether<br>socializing reading working cooking<br>things that are meaningful to them<br>however they Define them they are able<br>to cope better in the face of their<br>fatigue suggesting possible targets for<br>intervention<br>I've also continued my research into<br>young adult alcohol use its causes<br>its correlates and interventions to<br>reduce risky drinking<br>and my two key collaborators in this<br>area<br>is our Ben Reardon my former PhD student<br>who we and and associate professor<br>Damian scarf who is uh we co-supervised<br>Ben<br>and here we have used text messaging to<br>initially track young adults drinking<br>during High periods of risk so for<br>example during orientation week we would<br>send them a text<br>in the nighttime say how many alcohol<br>drinks did you have yesterday or how<br>many did you have tonight<br>and in our one of our initial studies<br>showed that<br>the amount of alcohol that young adults<br>consume during a period of risk during<br>this orientation week predicts their<br>patterns of drinking across the Academic<br>Year suggesting that maybe if we<br>intervene during orientation week to<br>reduce their drinking this could have<br>positive flow on consequences for<br>reducing their alcohol use later on<br>that's exactly what we've found in a<br>couple of other interventions where we<br>did these brief interventions and send<br>send them targeted messages<br>during orientation for week for example<br>tonight think about your mates when you<br>drink you can ruin their nights too so<br>we so we experimented with health<br>messages students don't care about<br>health at all<br>but they care about their friends<br>so the friend messages worked the health<br>messages don't changing women is easier<br>changing men is harder<br>so we did a lot of this type of<br>intervention research and then as part<br>of this work we also recognize the<br>limitations of solely relying on<br>self-reported alcohol use and branched<br>out into measuring blood alcohol<br>concentration with police grade<br>breathalyzers and this is really fun<br>work that we had some of our our<br>students go out<br>to large social Gatherings and in one<br>study they breathalyzed over 500<br>students and compared their their blood<br>alcohol concentration from the device<br>measured um<br>the device measurements to people's<br>self-reported levels of intoxication and<br>we found actually that there was pretty<br>good correspondence between their<br>objective and subjective levels of<br>intoxication except at very high levels<br>of intoxication when people were really<br>bad they underestimated how drunk they<br>and lastly<br>I increasingly I've been focused on<br>understanding another important health<br>behavior for young adults which is<br>vaping<br>which is quickly shifting from being<br>used as a smoking cessation tool to its<br>own growing Public Health concern<br>and my first foray into this topic was<br>collaborating on a project to explore<br>Pathways from smoking to vaping in<br>people who we gave a vaping device to<br>try to help them quit smoking and this<br>is work that I did with Professor Janet<br>hook and mailing blank Jimmy Zhang and<br>Vicki and<br>we also so we gave them a vape<br>encouraged them to to try to quit<br>smoking and track their vaping and<br>smoking patterns over time for a very<br>long time<br>and here what we showed is that each<br>person has their own unique Journey from<br>smoking to vaping over time this is a<br>sequence plot<br>that every row is a person and each<br>Square in the row is a day that we<br>measured them and the color of the<br>square is whether they reported smoking<br>cigarettes that day in blue whether they<br>reported vaping that day in yellow<br>whether they smoked and Vaped in Orange<br>so-called dual use or whether they<br>abstain from both and what you could see<br>here is that there is no one set pattern<br>everybody has their own journey and<br>variation is quite common here<br>so um<br>you can see this this complex movement<br>at the micro daily level between smoking<br>and vaping suggesting that people aren't<br>just shifting very linearly from smoking<br>to vaping over time<br>and these complex movements between<br>smoking and vaping are also seen in<br>macro longitudinal data which we<br>recently published using the data from<br>the New Zealand attitudes and values<br>study with my fine collaborators here<br>with this project led by Andre Mason and<br>Damian Scar from you explored laundry<br>I'm not going to describe this this<br>graph but you can see that that there's<br>flow from from smoking to vaping and<br>sometimes back again<br>and it's not not at all linear<br>some people transition from smoking to<br>vaping and other people transition from<br>and then my PhD student Grace T is hard<br>at work discovering important<br>psychological predictors of vaping in<br>young adults<br>showing highlighting that young adults<br>who are more sociable<br>less conscientious and who have mental<br>health issues may be more likely to take<br>now along my academic journey I have<br>supervised<br>outstanding students I think this is<br>most of them it doesn't have my<br>undergraduate research project students<br>but these are all of my postgraduate<br>students and with great supervisors from<br>within the department of psychology and<br>many other departments and I'm so proud<br>of my students who've gone on to apply<br>their Education and Training in<br>government agencies Wellness startups<br>Wellness businesses Private Practice as<br>clinical psychologists Health<br>psychologists and yes academics<br>and I've also had incredible<br>collaborators and supportive funders so<br>here are some of the other collaborators<br>that I wasn't able to feature on the<br>previous slides<br>and I'm sure even this list is an<br>incomplete<br>I'd also like to acknowledge the support<br>of my current head of part head of<br>department and friend jamon halberstadt<br>previous heads of Department the pro<br>Vice Chancellor for the division of<br>Sciences for otago Professor Richard<br>Barker<br>for their support and Leadership<br>and as the meme goes maybe the real<br>outputs were the friends that we made<br>so<br>are you happy<br>if not what did my science say about how<br>you can be happier well there may be<br>multiple pathways<br>each year five plus a day of fruits and<br>vegetables including kiwi fruit and<br>carrots<br>get plenty of sunshine and vitamin D get<br>high quality sleep exercise daily spend<br>at least 20 to 60 Minutes in nature<br>every day be mindful engage in small<br>acts of creativity<br>minimize alcohol Vape only is a smoking<br>cessation tool<br>and do we do all of these things<br>no no we don't and that's another<br>challenge the disconnect between what we<br>know to be good for us and what we do<br>actually do and perhaps that challenge<br>will be the focus of my research for the<br>next 15 years thank you<br>foreign<br>okay<br>in uh manduhiri now<br>uhurangi ho tenakoto<br>Oklahoma<br>Koto<br>um<br>foreign<br>era I am Jamin halberstadt head of the<br>Department of psychology I am very happy<br>honored<br>delighted to be part of the academic<br>party that is supporting<br>uh the inaugural professorial lecture of<br>my long time friend and colleague<br>Professor Tamlin Connor<br>um thank you all for coming<br>um welcome to everyone<br>um especially David and Graham<br>uh you're looking very cute there<br>um so I've um I've known Tamlin a long<br>time since she was hired here in 2008<br>maybe maybe met even before that as soon<br>as I met her you<br>I knew that I'd probably be attending<br>your inaugural professorial lecture one<br>day<br>I don't know I don't think I may have<br>made that sentiment clear when we first<br>met because all I can remember I think I<br>sort of ham-handedly said uh<br>I think you're I think I said you're<br>taller than I thought it was my I was my<br>first first thing I said to you<br>um<br>anyway um I discovered uh<br>in this process Tamlin and I uh share<br>academic relatives<br>so uh like in Maori culture academic<br>culture acknowledges our debts to our<br>ancestors and their ongoing influence in<br>our lives so it's sort of interesting to<br>reflect on how Tamlin and I have<br>intersected in our past so John thibo<br>that's why I say his name anyway<br>um who who tamler mentioned that's her<br>intellectual great grandparent<br>uh as she pointed out he was uh<br>supervised by Kurt Lewin who is<br>considered the uh founder or first<br>modern social psychologist<br>which is our field<br>but his other Supervisor was a man named<br>Darwin Cartwright who is a founder of<br>the study of group dynamics<br>um Cartwright uh had another student<br>from another marriage so to speak uh Rob<br>uh who is um Bob Zions who himself is a<br>legend in the field of social psychology<br>especially in the study of emotions and<br>he is my own academic grandparent so<br>Tamlin and I are step second cousins<br>once removed<br>very exciting<br>um so uh while we're at it actually Zion<br>says other Supervisor was a guy named<br>Daniel Katz he's the founder of the<br>field of organizational psychology<br>his great grandparent was Carl schmf<br>philosopher and founder of Gestalt<br>psychology and also debunker of clever<br>Hans the turn of the century horse that<br>supposedly knew how to add and speak<br>German<br>um Stumpf had a especially influential<br>student<br>Kurt Lewin who as you saw forms a direct<br>line to Tamlin<br>I hope that is all clear<br>um<br>I can actually I can see though our<br>intellectual ancestors in Tamlin the<br>holistic approach of the Gestalt<br>psychologists the focus on the person in<br>the situation that forms the foundation<br>of social psychology Primacy of<br>emotional experience that Bob Zions<br>promoted the uncompromising and incisive<br>mind that led Stumpf to see right<br>through a counting horse<br>not to mention the fourth brightness<br>fearlessness and iconoclasm of her own<br>PhD supervisor Lisa Feldman Barrett and<br>I'd like to think that our shared<br>Heritage is part of what led us to study<br>uh the nature and causes of emotional<br>experiences from at least compatible<br>perspectives<br>so um so I I am in a position I think to<br>say that Tamlin is one of the most<br>exciting psychological scientists<br>working today both in terms of content<br>and methodology<br>um happiness as we've said several times<br>today happiness and subjective<br>well-being are Hot Topics<br>um you've noticed I'm sure if you've got<br>or been around any teenagers that um<br>it's not these days it's not so much how<br>well off you are it's how well-off you<br>feel<br>and it's not just teenagers who think<br>this either like real life adults and<br>politicians do as well<br>um so you know as we've seen um<br>you know there are many societies now<br>are turning<br>to measuring health of their economies<br>not only in these Financial in you know<br>traditional financial terms but also in<br>Social ones so gross domestic product is<br>sort of is out is and the well-being<br>economy is in and of course people don't<br>entirely agree<br>um on what makes for a satisfying or<br>rewarding life but what is interesting<br>now is that the these efforts to kind of<br>quantify these the good and rewarding<br>life include what people themselves<br>think about their own subjective<br>happiness we ask people<br>ask people themselves how they're doing<br>and tamlin's work gets right to the<br>heart of this matter<br>um asking directly what the behaviors<br>are that are associated<br>with well-being that are and tracking<br>these in nearly real time using Cutting<br>Edge Technologies and her work provides<br>you know real practical evidence-based<br>answers right fruits and vegetables<br>sleep nature mindfulness creativity<br>I guess I'll hold off on the alcohol for<br>them for the moment<br>um and Tamlin don't listen to those<br>redditors who say that it's all um it's<br>all obvious uh guys look if they knew so<br>much about well-being what are they<br>doing on social media to start with<br>um you know social psychology plus<br>anyway is littered with uh debunkings of<br>things that we thought we knew all along<br>this is kind of social psychology's<br>thing<br>it's especially true in the case of<br>well-being as is sort of famously the<br>case in the relationship between wealth<br>and happiness which is well I maybe not<br>flat but at least uh kind of non-linear<br>so you would be if you have no money you<br>will probably be a little happier if you<br>get some but uh being rich is not the<br>key to happiness<br>um and the benefits of diet could easily<br>have mimicked those of wealth something<br>that seems obvious but just turns out<br>not to be true<br>right Julia is I I think this is true<br>Julia Child said the only time you need<br>to eat diet food is while you're waiting<br>for the steak to cook<br>so um and diet food I think that's<br>old-timey talk for um for uh fruits and<br>vegetables<br>um so anyway the point is that people<br>don't know what will make them happy so<br>don't don't listen to those who say they<br>do unless they come with data like<br>Professor Connor<br>so not only does she have data on what<br>makes you happy she has something to say<br>about what makes you happy so her<br>longitudinal cross lag studies allow us<br>to start to make causal inferences about<br>these factors this is causality from<br>correlation it's it's like almost like<br>magic only science<br>so Tamlin<br>kapai congratulations on your<br>outstanding if inevitable success I want<br>to thank everyone for coming and I am<br>instructed to invite you all no I'm<br>pleased to invite you all sorry uh to<br>the are we is it in the staff Club is<br>that we're going to be a staff Club<br>where there may be there will be<br>Refreshments maybe canapes I'm not sure<br>um and we have a special gift for you<br>Tamlin<br>if you would like to come up and receive<br>it with<br>any special guests you want to bring<br>so um that's all for me please join me<br>one more time in thanking Tamlin and all<br>of our hosts today for your for your<br>talk and please come and join us to<br>celebrate in the staff Club</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
