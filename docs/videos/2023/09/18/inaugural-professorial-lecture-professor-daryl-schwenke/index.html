engagement for<br>the University and it's my great<br>pleasure and honor to be the host of<br>this IPL this evening a very warm<br>welcome to you on what is a fairly cool<br>good evening evening so welcome to those<br>of you who are here in person but also<br>greetings to those of you who are online<br>either live or maybe watching from the<br>future<br>I think it's very appropriate that these<br>greedy these gatherings always begin<br>with the Mahi and acknowledgment into<br>real Maori but as I acknowledge<br>especially in this week which is to Wiki<br>Waterloo Marley Maori language week<br>um in my menu I started by acknowledging<br>the bonds that connect us together and<br>of course we connected strongly as a<br>university community<br>acknowledging the location where we're<br>gathered<br>acknowledging monofinoa our key Trilogy<br>partners of course those who have passed<br>before us and then returning to the room<br>greeting Daryl greeting our<br>distinguished guests and all of you<br>um Daryl I acknowledge your friends and<br>family but I think a particular<br>acknowledgment now to your wife Jane and<br>children Zachary faith and Esha<br>um these are special occasions<br>we are wearing our robes at the<br>University of otago we now wear these<br>very rarely we wear them at graduations<br>when we come together to celebrate<br>students at the end of their academic<br>Journeys and we wear them at these<br>occasions an organ professorial lectures<br>where we celebrate our colleagues being<br>promoted to the highest rank within the<br>university so the fact that we're<br>wearing these robes underlines the<br>specialness of the occasion<br>and these events are special for two<br>reasons one's special because they're an<br>opportunity for us to come together to<br>listen to reflect and celebrate the<br>scholarship to teaching the service of<br>one of our esteemed colleagues<br>but they're also very important they're<br>very special because there are occasions<br>in which we can celebrate the core<br>business of the University<br>teaching<br>research that underpins that teaching<br>and of course that is as good in its own<br>end and our leadership community service<br>work and our work as members of<br>professions so these are opportunities<br>for us to really celebrate what the<br>university is about<br>so it is a fantastic opportunity for us<br>to come together to celebrate the<br>outstanding scholar and colleague that<br>there was and more broadly to celebrate<br>the place of knowledge and blinding our<br>community together so it's a special<br>occasion a special evening and again<br>welcome to you all<br>um katsi enough for me I am now<br>delighted to hand over to Professor Lisa<br>our medicine Smith who will carry on<br>Smith<br>so welcome everybody Kia Ora talofa and<br>warm Pacific greetings it is my honor<br>and pleasure as the the dean or the<br>acting dean of the school of biomedical<br>Sciences to formally<br>introduce the the inaugural the the<br>professors in their inaugural<br>professorial lectures and as Tony is so<br>um<br>nicely explained these are incredibly<br>important and special moments for us as<br>academics but it's also I think one of<br>the the great Joys not only introducing<br>the ipl's but but listening to our<br>colleagues not only just not only talk<br>about their amazing research which we<br>often hear a lot about we focus on the<br>research outcomes and what people are<br>doing their teaching but to actually<br>um hear hear the journey and really<br>understand how it is that that our<br>professors have have reached this stage<br>and you know it's exciting to hear as<br>colleagues I think it's really important<br>for students as well to to hear these<br>stories particularly our graduate<br>students and and you know it often seems<br>like it's this magical journey but it's<br>it's fascinating it is magical and<br>fascinating but but also a lot of<br>interesting twists and turns often<br>um in in the journey to to Professor so<br>um formerly I can say uh Professor Daryl<br>schwenke is a cardiovascular<br>physiologist with a particular interest<br>in neuroendocrine control of the heart<br>and the vascular system in health and<br>disease<br>so looking at his academic background he<br>started his academic career as an<br>undergraduate at the University at<br>Victoria University in Wellington when<br>he received his his BSC honors in 1993<br>and then came to the University of otago<br>finishing his Masters in 1995 and his<br>PhD in August of 2002. after uh<br>undertaking in his PhD of course it's<br>nice to see Pat cragg here with Pat<br>Craig in the department of physiology<br>after his PhD he worked as a junior<br>research fellow for a year in the<br>department of Orthopedics and Physiology<br>um through until 2003 and then he took<br>off for what has has become a long-term<br>relationship with researchers in Japan<br>so he undertook a postdoc and and<br>fellowships from 2003 to 2006 at the<br>national cardiovascular research<br>institute<br>in Japan<br>where he I assume was really introduced<br>to using the synchrotron radiation<br>microangiography so hopefully we're<br>going to hear a bit more about what that<br>is<br>um and started his journey in<br>identifying the physiological<br>significance of what was at that time a<br>newly discovered hormone known as<br>ghrelin and the impact of that on<br>cardiovascular control<br>so he maintained those relationships<br>with his colleagues in in Japan and went<br>on to further sabbatical visits in 2011<br>and um in 2017 and has published<br>numerous papers with his colleagues<br>both here<br>um and and in Japan he returned to otago<br>as a postdoctoral fellow in 2006 and<br>maintained that role until 2009 when he<br>took up a lectureship in the department<br>of physiology<br>moving quickly to senior lecture<br>associate professor and of course most<br>recently professor<br>so in terms of his research Daryl's uh<br>received more than two million dollars<br>including two very recent HRC health<br>research Council projects which he's<br>currently maintaining the the research<br>in these two areas with truly fabulous<br>titles I always love a good title so one<br>of them is Ken loss of hunger hormone<br>increased cardiovascular disease in<br>Pacific peoples but the second one is<br>one that I really enjoy can love break<br>your heart oxytocin makes the failing<br>heart skip a beat so it also goes quite<br>nicely I think with your your title of<br>your IPL<br>Daryl has published over 70 papers and<br>top International peer-reviewed journals<br>with high impact factor but he's also<br>undertaken some incredibly important<br>research here in aotearoa focusing on<br>Health in in Pacific in particular<br>Samoan<br>communities and looking at the topic of<br>important issues like the use of bodily<br>tissues in research and how that might<br>be seen differently seen in in Pacific<br>populations and the importance of that<br>um so some some incredibly important<br>Community<br>engaged health research<br>outstanding teaching of course is a<br>requirement of a new professor and and<br>Daryl has certainly shown that he's<br>supervised and co-supervised numerous<br>PhD in MSC students and countless honors<br>a list of honors and and summer students<br>was was truly impressive he's teaching<br>and convening at all levels here at the<br>University of otago but also was<br>involved in<br>um<br>really facilitating the teaching the<br>development the teaching and first-year<br>medicine at the National University of<br>Samoa taking Knowledge from from our<br>teaching first year teaching and so<br>forth here and really helping out with<br>the development there<br>in service again outstanding service<br>Daryl was our inaugural associate Dean<br>Pacific from 2018 through to 2021<br>uh and that was really where where I got<br>to know uh know him and his work but<br>that really did start uh the Journey of<br>the school<br>um on uh<br>increasing engagement with Pacific<br>students Pacific research and Pacific<br>communities which is an incredibly<br>important aspect of what we do and that<br>benefits all of us so greatly so thank<br>you for that incredible work that you<br>did and really starting that that<br>Journey that we are now continuing you<br>moved from that tough role to another<br>one that I'm I'm very thankful for and<br>that is chairing the University of otago<br>animal Ethics Committee which is a huge<br>job but again so incredibly important<br>for the work that we do in the school of<br>biomedical Sciences<br>so I will leave it there but just ask<br>you to join me and and welcome me Daryl<br>to give his inaugural professorial<br>lecture on sympathetic to the heart of<br>the Pacific where he's going to be<br>telling us<br>um at first I thought that was a<br>crayfish that you were holding which<br>shows kind of how anatomically inclined<br>I am but um and really looking forward<br>to hearing your lectures so Daryl please<br>our professor schwenky I should say<br>please<br>foreign<br>Samoa<br>um<br>o<br>why uh<br>Samoa<br>wow<br>very warm greetings to all of you here<br>this evening I'm truly humbled<br>that you have come to join me as I share<br>the journey that I've been on in this uh<br>in this academic trip<br>in the introductions I welcomed you but<br>all I also asked the question<br>who am I<br>and I guess this is an opportunity to<br>share with you<br>um exactly who I am<br>if you understood what I said in Samoan<br>you could walk out of here and know<br>exactly what the rest of the talk is<br>going to be about but for those that<br>didn't quite understand<br>the the Samoan language you get the<br>privilege of sitting through a drawn out<br>talk<br>this<br>500 horsepower motor<br>with a torque of 2 000 pounds<br>for foot<br>and it has carrying capacity of 80 tonne<br>now you may be thinking why on Earth<br>would you know that Daryl<br>and the reason for that is because as a<br>as a young lad I had an absolute<br>fascination with trucks<br>everything intrigued me about them the<br>power how much they could carry<br>and this sort of became a little bit of<br>an obsession<br>and then there was this movie called<br>over the top and this was the story of a<br>of a truck driver traveling across the<br>United States with a son and an<br>opportunity to to get to know his son a<br>lot better and at different towns he<br>would enter Regional arm wrestling<br>competitions<br>until ultimately he moved on to the<br>national champs and he overcame All Odds<br>and he won the national arm wrestling<br>champion<br>so after seeing this movie it was fixed<br>in my mind that After High School I<br>would become a truck driver<br>immigrate over to Australia first but<br>then move on to the states entering<br>National Regional arm wrestling<br>competitions with the goal of becoming<br>many of you won't be surprised that I<br>didn't become a world champion arm<br>wrestler in fact after seeing this movie<br>I challenged my mother to an arm<br>wrestler and she whipped me<br>it wasn't a good start<br>but by the grace of God something else<br>was planned and that was for me to<br>become a biomedical researcher<br>and so on this evening's talk I'm really<br>just wanting to share the journey<br>through the Pacific which has taken me<br>originally from the heart of the Pacific<br>to New Zealand<br>back and forth with Japan<br>as well as this island off the coast of<br>New Zealand called Australia<br>but then ultimately back to the heart of<br>the Pacific<br>so starting at the beginning<br>I'm of Samoan descent my father was born<br>and raised in a small village called<br>alamogato in apia Samoa<br>and so as my identity isn't that that's<br>where my Story begins my father migrated<br>to New Zealand and after traveling<br>around New Zealand for some time<br>him with my mother who is of New Zealand<br>descent<br>settled in<br>a small suburb of lower Hutt called<br>ninai<br>it was very humble beginnings<br>we start we we lived in state housing we<br>were in the lower socio-economic group<br>um but you know<br>we were happy<br>for those of you who've noticed you can<br>see that I have no idea what I'm writing<br>in the front there that's me at the very<br>bottom<br>but to my left as a truck<br>and I'm just wondering if that's where<br>my fascination of trucks began<br>so although we didn't have much<br>we had a lot of fun<br>for those of you who know me you know<br>I've got a bit of a a whacked sense of<br>humor and I guarantee it came from my<br>father he was joking all the time so<br>there was a lot of laughter<br>one of the strongest things that my<br>parents imparted on me was the the<br>importance of work ethic to work hard at<br>what you do<br>I have to admit as a young lad I didn't<br>Embrace that fully until later on in<br>life<br>but this is where it started<br>they also said enjoy every moment<br>work hard but enjoy every moment so at<br>the front there are my two parents my<br>mother and father and they just loved to<br>experience adrenaline rushes and once<br>the to the left my my mother is my my<br>cousin she was loud I can I can just say<br>that<br>so I<br>um<br>in in the early years I I guess I was a<br>bit of a<br>Joker I did like to play pranks and I'm<br>not quite sure if I've fully grown or<br>grown out of that<br>but I love to have fun and so therefore<br>when it came to school I didn't really<br>take School seriously and a lot of the<br>time I was the class Joker just loving<br>to have fun for those of you who can't<br>spot me in those two class photos I<br>always had the same position in every<br>so I as as Lisa alluded to I did my<br>undergraduate study<br>and Victoria University and found an<br>interest in uh I guess um<br>by by medical research and so the best<br>place to to further that without<br>question was to move to otago<br>now of course otago is renowned for the<br>beauty of its University but there it<br>was a great surprise to learn that there<br>was so much more to offer here at otago<br>with the steepest street in the world<br>the activities associated with the<br>steepest street in the world such as the<br>Jeff run<br>the beautiful Coast<br>of otago this is tunnel Beach<br>and the amazing Albatross Colony<br>otago Dunedin has so much to offer<br>but it was a wonder that as I came into<br>Dunedin airport for the very first time<br>in the South Island the plane was coming<br>into the airport and it was going over<br>farmland and I thought wow Dunedin is<br>really a heck country town but of course<br>it's because it's so far out of of town<br>I guess one of the uh<br>proudest things about otago is the<br>graduates the students that graduate<br>from otago University<br>when you look at them you can see the<br>potential that they have to change the<br>future<br>but at the same time when you look at<br>them it is amazing to see the Antics<br>that they get up to<br>I think it might have been maybe last<br>year or the year before<br>I was teaching a paper that had 120<br>students in it<br>I turned up to a lecture one morning and<br>there were three students that attended<br>the lecture<br>and it was hard not to take that<br>personally I thought am I really that<br>bad<br>but fortunately one of the students came<br>down to me at the end and said Daryl up<br>doc shrink please don't take this<br>personally but the day before was St<br>Patrick's Day so most of the students<br>are probably still in bed<br>so that was a relief to hear that<br>as you sit there this evening you're<br>looking at this very<br>straight<br>hard-nosed academic<br>very serious professional<br>but I do need to<br>I guess disclose the fact that as a<br>student I also got up to some Antics and<br>one of those was to disguise myself for<br>all of my student ID photos<br>I particularly like 1999 where I had a<br>ring through the nose<br>and I thought how am I going to beat<br>that until 2001 where I had big bottle<br>glasses a chain going from the nose to<br>my ear and fluff up my nostrils<br>word of this got to<br>um one of the local newspapers and this<br>and so all I can say is thank you thank<br>you thank you to the University of otago<br>for still allowing me to be enrolled<br>not only to the University of otago<br>but more importantly to profess Pat<br>Craig<br>I say thank you Pat and I say sorry for<br>all the pranks that I pulled<br>it was yeah very difficult to let go of<br>all those pranks<br>I do have to acknowledge Pat though she<br>was<br>the one who taught me The Importance of<br>Being absolutely meticulous in<br>everything you did<br>one of the things that really stood out<br>to me and I'm not embellishing this<br>but often I would go to Pat and ask a<br>question of I'm not quite sure who did<br>this<br>and I'm not sure if you remember Pat but<br>you would say well if you go to the<br>third floor of the medical Library<br>go to the fifth aisle and about 10<br>meters down there will be a book called<br>Blah Blah now if you go to page 297<br>you'll find the exact answer to that<br>it's true<br>and and I was just amazed that she hit<br>the nail on the head every single time<br>so Pat took me on as her Masters and PhD<br>student and the area that we were<br>particularly interested in was looking<br>at how<br>uh the breathing of high altitude<br>dwellers is altered in order to adapt to<br>the low oxygen environment with which<br>they live<br>unlike all other mammals or humans shall<br>I say those that are born and reside at<br>high altitude do not respond<br>to low oxygen by increasing their<br>breathing which is a fascinating finding<br>so you would be forgiven for thinking<br>well if you want to look at the changes<br>in breathing at high altitude you need<br>to go and study participants at high<br>altitude<br>and as great as that sounds I had far<br>better plans rather I got to work with<br>these little furballs called guinea pigs<br>and you may be thinking why guinea pigs<br>well I didn't know this at the time but<br>guinea pigs originate from this from the<br>Andes Mountains of South America and so<br>they actually possess the very trait<br>that we're interested in studying that<br>is a poor response or breathing response<br>to hypoxia<br>so essentially my masters and PhD was<br>trying to understand why or the<br>mechanisms as to why they have this poor<br>by the end of my PhD I had gained an<br>intriguing appreciation of how the whole<br>body works together<br>how things that go on in the periphery<br>can communicate with the brain and how<br>the brain can communicate with the rest<br>of the body<br>and so I wanted to pursue this as I<br>started to look for Endeavors overseas<br>and in the words of our prime minister<br>Chris Hipkins it was time to spread my<br>legs and go abroad<br>and so this is where I then moved over<br>to Japan<br>I was fortunate enough to gain a jsps<br>fellowship which is the Japan Society<br>for the promotion of science<br>which allowed me to travel to Japan for<br>the post-doctoral years<br>I'd never been to Japan I don't think<br>I'd really heard much about Japan at all<br>but<br>I had recently also become married yes<br>someone did decide to marry me<br>and my wife had done a Bachelor of Arts<br>in Japanese so it seemed a good idea to<br>look for a potential postdoc in Japan<br>turned out to be a real career a<br>slingshot<br>it was an incredibly it is an incredibly<br>Rich culture<br>but it's not just a case of observing a<br>culture such as this but to also<br>experience the culture of Japan<br>so therefore where we observed the<br>beauty of the kimono and the beauty of<br>the Geisha<br>we also<br>or the kimono well I didn't but<br>where we learned or observed<br>the samurai<br>we became the samurai<br>and where we are where we observed the<br>beauty of Mount Fuji<br>it was important to<br>experience Mount Fuji as well<br>so there were all these cultural<br>experiences which were life-changing<br>it always impressed upon me the the<br>juxtaposition of the old versus the new<br>in a culture like Japan where they<br>pristinely maintained or preserved<br>the um the castles of old wild building<br>Grand Towers such as the Sky Tree in<br>Tokyo<br>the only thing I found Difficult about<br>the culture of Japan is the density of<br>the population with the population of<br>130 million in a country just over the<br>size of New Zealand<br>um I I'm I do sort of suffer from from<br>dense populations like this so I did<br>find it difficult to go amongst cities<br>such as Tokyo and Osaka in Osaka is<br>where we're where we were ultimately<br>based<br>but fortunately in Osaka there there is<br>a mountainous region around the<br>periphery of the main city and we were<br>located in Mino<br>which is right on the border of the the<br>mountains and so it was very easy to<br>Dart into the mountains<br>um I also I worked in a town the<br>neighboring town called sweeter at the<br>national cerebral and cardiovascular<br>research center<br>this particular place was famous in<br>Japan for being the first hospital to<br>perform the heart transplant and so<br>therefore it was favored uh favored a<br>lot by the Japanese government for<br>funding and so it was very easy to do<br>some really staggering science at this<br>Center<br>now when you look at this picture it<br>looks quite glamorous but just to fully<br>disclose the blue building here is the<br>hospital and that little white building<br>out the out the back there is the<br>research institute which is where I<br>worked<br>I was located in the department of<br>cardiac physiology which was headed by<br>Professor hidezel Morty<br>upon entering this department they were<br>incredibly<br>welcoming<br>and I really felt part of the community<br>almost straight away<br>within the department itself<br>there were different research teams and<br>I was part of a team that was headed by<br>my mentor at the time Professor michiasu<br>Shiro or just Mickey<br>um<br>and I was also part of the team with<br>both Dr hirotsugu duchimochi or Hiro and<br>Dr Pearson or just James with which both<br>hero and James have since then<br>come to visit our department<br>then there was me Kare<br>and I was called this quite often well a<br>few times<br>whenever we had a departmental meeting<br>where there was a guest that was coming<br>the head of Department who was a little<br>bit quiet he would often introduce the<br>guests to the rest of us and he would<br>say something along the lines of your<br>clawsaw<br>and I thought oh<br>I must be so so up there that he's just<br>not used to the you know to having<br>someone so Elite in the department I'm<br>that special guest but of course part of<br>the fellowship that I went over with<br>gave you Japanese lessons so as I<br>learned more and more about what he was<br>saying what he was actually saying was<br>well welcome this is Dr akiyama this is<br>Dr yamazaki this is Dr nisshirder and Dr<br>I tried not to take that personally I<br>was told by the others that he he didn't<br>really sort of focus on people in his<br>periphery<br>then it came to the working to working<br>in the the research labs and there was a<br>certain etiquette that had to be<br>followed working in a lot of the<br>Japanese labs and one of them was<br>to change your shoes or take off your<br>shoes before you go into the lab and<br>take and wear some of the in-house<br>slippers of course if you had your own<br>slippers that was always beneficial but<br>if you didn't have your own slippers you<br>had to use the in-house slippers which<br>was fine for me I didn't mind that<br>but over the years I've taken many<br>postgraduate students to work in Japan<br>and it becomes a little bit difficult<br>when you take a six foot<br>four<br>individual to work in Japan where his<br>he was incredibly tall and so even<br>working in the lab itself<br>he often had to sit on a makeshift stall<br>so that he could get his legs under the<br>bench<br>um he so he did struggle<br>so there were certain good practices or<br>research etiquette a lab etiquette that<br>we had to follow and I think of what<br>would poor research lab etiquette look<br>like and this diagram or this picture<br>here Far Side is actually in one of our<br>third year labs and I look at it and I<br>laugh because I think how outrageous it<br>would be to have food and chemicals in<br>the same room not only that but to have<br>food and chemicals side by side that you<br>could possibly get them mixed up how<br>ridiculous is that<br>I laugh but 15 years ago is pretty<br>normal<br>this is a panorama panoramic photo of<br>the lab that I was working in and to the<br>to your left is where my desk was so<br>that's my office behind my office or the<br>desk is the fridge<br>for food and chemicals right beside my<br>desk was the work that the uh the lab<br>bench with which we did our experiments<br>with rodents in the back is a little<br>cupboard where we housed our animals and<br>so they were<br>freely freely accessible to the lab<br>itself<br>on the bench here you can see that we've<br>got coffee cups right beside the<br>chemicals in the fridge I would often<br>put my soup right beside the beaker of<br>cyanide so I just had to make sure that<br>I was grabbing the right cup as I was<br>pulling it out of the um out of the<br>fridge<br>because we did have the animals in the<br>same room or housed in the same room we<br>did have a couple of escapees<br>um one of them got behind a cupboard and<br>it was very difficult to get it so<br>somebody I won't name who came up with<br>the bright idea of using a gaseous<br>anesthetic to put the tube behind the<br>cupboard so it could make the animal go<br>to sleep and then we could retrieve it<br>the problem is I don't know who went to<br>so that wasn't such a smart idea<br>so what is the research that I'm<br>actually interested in<br>fundamentally I'm incredibly interested<br>in once again how the brain communicates<br>with the rest of the body<br>essentially although there are two<br>different organs in two different<br>locations it's important to understand<br>that they have this beautiful harmonious<br>relationship in the way that they<br>communicate with each other and they<br>communicate with each other through this<br>nerve pathway called the sympathetic<br>nervous system<br>and many of you may be familiar with the<br>nervous or the sympathetic nervous<br>system based on the fight or flight<br>response<br>when you're opposed or presented with a<br>threat the initial reaction is to<br>increase your heart rate to make the<br>heart pump stronger so that it can get<br>blood to the working muscles and the<br>event that you need to escape from the<br>threat or fight the threat<br>and so therefore the brain and the Heart<br>so that you have the best outcome<br>so these two different organs are<br>working incredibly tightly together<br>and I would like to call it perhaps a<br>love relationship between the heart and<br>the Brain<br>the problem comes however when<br>there is a challenge to the heart such<br>when there is a heart attack for example<br>if you get blockage of one of your main<br>coronary arteries the heart becomes<br>damaged and it can't work very<br>effectively and what it does is it<br>causes a breakdown in the way that the<br>heart and the Brain communicate together<br>and so they they essentially start<br>fighting towards each other and the<br>reason for this is because the heart is<br>Damaged and it's struggling to do its<br>job which is pump blood around the body<br>and so it's relaying this information<br>back to the brain saying hey look I'm<br>really struggling here to to cope with<br>the work that I've I've got the brain<br>is telling the heart well look every<br>other part of the body depends on you so<br>you really need to keep going and I<br>won't take Noah as an answer and so it<br>starts shouting at the heart saying work<br>work work the problem is the heart can't<br>cope and so ultimately it gives up and<br>that is what we see as sudden heart<br>failure<br>so a lot of the research that I do is<br>trying at that time was trying to<br>understand the mechanisms by which the<br>heart and the Brain communicate to have<br>this harmonious relationship but<br>importantly how<br>we can possibly restore this harmonious<br>now at exactly the same time in a<br>different department it was the<br>department of hypertension<br>was this uh this professor called Kenji<br>kangawa he ultimately became the<br>director of the entire Center<br>um and he was a renowned researcher for<br>exploratory research so what I mean by<br>exploratory research is his passion was<br>trying to discover new hormones to<br>discover new things about the body and<br>we had a conversation once and he said<br>there's pros and cons about this<br>he said there is nothing more<br>exhilarating than knowing that you have<br>discovered that something that will<br>potentially change the way we do<br>clinical practice<br>plus the fame that comes with making a<br>new discovery far outweighs anything<br>that he could possibly imagine<br>the problem however with exploratory<br>research is you can guarantee that you<br>won't be the only one trying to discover<br>a new hormone<br>and so hormone Discovery can be<br>considered as a race<br>because lots of people are trying to<br>discover this new hormone and you could<br>spend years trying to discover a hormone<br>only to find out that somebody else has<br>found it first which means all of that<br>and so not long before I arrived at the<br>national Cardiovascular Center Kenji<br>kangawa<br>um and his team discovered this gut<br>now one of the beauties of discovering a<br>new hormone is that you get to name it<br>and so Kenji kungawa sat down with his<br>team<br>there was I think there was solder Dr<br>Soda Dr tokadomi and Ellen and they were<br>sitting there trying to think of the<br>name what they called call this new<br>hormone<br>but unfortunately that morning Ellen<br>hadn't actually eaten breakfast or any<br>food<br>and so her stomach was really rumbling<br>and this was really annoying Kenji until<br>he finally had had enough and he said to<br>Ellen he says why on Earth is your tummy<br>going Girl Ellen and that is how we got<br>so relin was discovered as the gut<br>hormone<br>it stimulates your appetite it makes you<br>want to eat<br>so therefore it's been implicated as one<br>of the main hormones that drives satiety<br>but not only that it also induces or<br>modulates how that energy is changed<br>within the body so you take food in<br>because of ghrelin<br>but then ghrelin works with that food to<br>create the energy you need to to live<br>now I guess one of the conundrums at the<br>time was this is a hormone that was<br>discovered in the gut but we are working<br>in a Cardiovascular Center so the<br>obvious question was well how can this<br>hormone possibly affect the<br>cardiovascular system<br>because it is almost unheard of that an<br>a hormone has only one Soul effect<br>so this is where<br>kangawa and and Mickey collaborated to<br>try and identify some of the roles which<br>growl and impacts on the cardiovascular<br>system and this is where I came into<br>to to bring my expertise at looking at<br>this heart brain communication<br>we talked about the idea that the heart<br>and the Brain they don't get on after a<br>heart attack because of this breakdown<br>of communication but what we tried was<br>to say well after a heart attack if we<br>give the hormone ghrelin<br>what happens about this relationship<br>between the heart and the brain and what<br>we found is that ghrelin was able to I<br>guess act as a mediator between the<br>brain and the heart and say come on you<br>guys you both love each other<br>and so therefore it didn't activate the<br>sympathetic nerve activity<br>which meant the heart could actually<br>recover from the insult of a heart<br>attack so it was able to be essentially<br>repaired<br>and in doing so it restored this loving<br>harmonious relationship<br>so we were over the moon about this<br>discovery because it provided a novel<br>therapeutic strategy<br>for pursuing clinical trials<br>but on top of this we thought well if it<br>has such a profound impact on this type<br>of relationship between the heart and<br>the Brain surely it must have other<br>cardiovascular benefits<br>we've just shown that it improves the<br>sympathetic control of the heart<br>so maybe it acts in other cardiovascular<br>diseases such as a lung disease for<br>example pulmonary hypertension or maybe<br>it also acts on vessels blood vessels<br>like our coronary vessels<br>or our peripheral arteries<br>because these are subject to<br>cardiovascular disease so the whale had<br>had ultimately gained momentum to start<br>but suddenly everything came to a<br>just when I thought life<br>couldn't get any better<br>I thought I was at the Pinnacle of my<br>research<br>could life really get any better<br>it's amazing how your first child can<br>not long after that came<br>my daughter faith<br>she still pokes her tongue at me<br>and then finally number three Asher<br>all three have had a profound impact on<br>my life<br>and my attitude towards towards uh<br>is much fun<br>as it is having children<br>I would go to work to relax because<br>these three<br>caused utter exhaustion<br>now it was a personal decision that<br>after the birth of my my firstborn<br>as much as I loved working in Japan I<br>personally didn't want to to remain in<br>Japan with with my children and so my<br>wife and I agreed that it you know let's<br>try and move back towards New Zealand to<br>be with family<br>and so therefore this triggered the<br>return back to New Zealand of course<br>opportunities are not always abundant<br>and once again I'm incredibly thankful<br>to to Pat who offered me a postdoc with<br>her<br>um<br>and so I came back to to otago and<br>worked with Pat and I think the timing<br>was quite good because it wasn't long<br>after that that an academic position<br>became available<br>and so in 2009 I took up a lectureship<br>um now I do remember that at the uh at<br>that time<br>pet<br>knew my my joking ways my prankster ways<br>and she she did uh have a a very<br>um<br>growing up talk we'll say<br>and she said to me you know Daryl you've<br>been a joker you've been a prankster but<br>you know you are entering an academic<br>position<br>so you need to act like a professional<br>and I thought you know that they are<br>wise words very wise words and so the<br>conversation carried on and then she<br>said to me oh by the way Dara<br>whereabouts do you live<br>so I said to well do you know do you<br>know Northeast Valley and she said yeah<br>yeah and I said if you go down Northeast<br>Valley all the way to the end you come<br>to a fork<br>where where if you go straight ahead you<br>go to bethune's Galley if you go right<br>it goes up around Mount Cargill and she<br>went oh yeah yep yep yep and I said well<br>if you go about 100 meters<br>there's a street on your right and on<br>the corner there there's a house there<br>yeah yeah and I said not even close to<br>there<br>I'm over in waldronville and she goes<br>now this is what I'm talking about Daryl<br>thanks Pat<br>some things die hard<br>but once I was back in this academic<br>position and with Pat it was an<br>opportunity to reignite this this<br>journey of understanding the benefits of<br>this hormone ghrelin on the<br>cardiovascular system<br>now one of the ways in which we can<br>assess<br>the health or Integrity of the the your<br>blood vessels is by way of angiography<br>or angiograms many of you may be<br>familiar with x-rays where you get a a<br>picture of your broken arm<br>x-rays can also be used<br>to look at the Integrity of your blood<br>vessels if you inject a contrast agent<br>into the blood vessels they they become<br>illuminated and you can see with<br>Precision how the health of those blood<br>vessels is<br>and this is a common technique used in<br>the hospital for assessing the coronary<br>or heart vessels of those that have had<br>a heart attack or myocardial infarction<br>so what they do is they put the patient<br>on this on the on the table and they<br>have this x-ray<br>that um is in close proximity to your<br>chest to look at the the coronary<br>vessels<br>now full disclosure<br>most of my research uses a pre-clinical<br>or an animal model<br>and most of those animal models are<br>rodents and so therefore if we were to<br>utilize an a piece of equipment such as<br>this we simply wouldn't have the power<br>or resolution to be able to visualize<br>these blood vessels it would be<br>impossible<br>so essentially we need something with a<br>bit more grunt a bit more power that can<br>actually visualize with the same sort of<br>resolution the blood vessels and a<br>rodent heart as we can see in the human<br>heart<br>and so therefore we needed to use this<br>thing called synchrotron radiation micro<br>angiography and this is the reason why<br>even since my return back to New Zealand<br>I've had ongoing collaborations with<br>those in Japan is because the<br>synchrotron facility is located in Japan<br>but on top of that<br>um<br>Australia have also developed a<br>synchrotron facility and so now we also<br>have the opportunity opportunity to<br>start you utilizing the Australian<br>synchrotron a lot of the work that I've<br>been doing at the spring 8 facility is<br>and has been in collaboration with Dr<br>Pearson but also my hod uh<br>Rajesh katari<br>um and we've spent a lot of time at<br>these facilities<br>so as you can appreciate at least with<br>the one in Japan and even the one in<br>Australia these are massive<br>facilities which generate synchrotron<br>radiation<br>now you'll be asking the question what<br>is synchrotron and geography and it's a<br>very very technical answer so I'll try<br>do my best to try and explain it<br>what it is is a really really really<br>really really really really<br>big x-ray machine that's about as best<br>as I can do<br>without without completely boring you<br>but essentially what it means is that we<br>can take something as small as a mouse<br>and we can do x-rays in any vascular bed<br>any organ<br>and look at the Precision or use the<br>Precision of the angiography to look at<br>the blood vessels in these animal models<br>so we were able to take an animal model<br>or take an animal a mouse that had<br>pulmonary hype tension<br>or a mouse that had coronary artery<br>disease or even peripheral artery<br>disease<br>and we were able to look at how these<br>vessels are damaged<br>in these tiny little mice using the<br>synchrotron facility<br>and the reason why this was so important<br>is because is because we could then<br>treat these diseased mice with ghrelin<br>to see if it impacts on the Integrity of<br>these blood vessels to see whether it<br>improves the health<br>of these animals and whether it reverses<br>so collectively if I were to sum up the<br>these studies collectively what we found<br>was that ghrelin had this unique ability<br>to cause the blood vessels to relax<br>one of the problems with a lot of<br>vascular diseases is they become so<br>tight and tense<br>that it it facilitates the disease but<br>gorillin was able to cause these vessels<br>to relax on top of that it was able to<br>cause the production or stimulate the<br>production of new blood vessels<br>in a diseased organ now the benefit of<br>these two things is that it increases<br>the blood flow to the diseased organ and<br>one of the key things for therapies is<br>to increase blood flow to that diseased<br>organ<br>so with this in mind what we did was we<br>took our animal models with peripheral<br>artery disease coronary artery disease<br>or pulmonary hypertension and treated<br>them with ghrelin and collectively every<br>time we consistently saw that ghrelin<br>was able to improve the health and<br>function of the blood vessels and<br>ultimately reverse the prognosis of the<br>disease<br>so this is fantastic outcomes and we<br>were over the moon but it's always<br>difficult to to I guess get financial<br>back and take it to to clinical trials<br>but on top of that we we need to ask the<br>our cardiovascular system is to some<br>degree already protected by the ghrelin<br>that we produce in our own bodies so we<br>can actually produce this hormone<br>so we asked the question well what<br>happens if you don't produce enough of<br>your own gorilla<br>so what we did was we were able to<br>generate once again a mouse model where<br>it had absolutely no ghrelin and compare<br>that with the mouse model that did have<br>a normal level of growing in it<br>and what we found to our amazement is<br>that these two different mice were<br>indistinguishable when we looked at the<br>cardiovascular system<br>same heart health same vascular Health<br>which was quite surprising<br>but what became apparent was when we<br>challenged the cardiovascular system of<br>these animals<br>so we would stress the cardiovascular<br>system<br>and then see how that the the animals<br>responded<br>now when we looked at the stress of the<br>it challenged but it did not disrupt<br>this brain heart communication so<br>sympathetic activity was maintained<br>normal<br>which meant the heart was also preserved<br>with its normal structure and integrity<br>and on top of that when we challenged<br>the cardiovascular system this the<br>health of the arteries was preserved now<br>when we compared that to the animals<br>that had absolutely no ghrelin it was<br>quite intriguing to find that these<br>animals could not tolerate any stress<br>towards their cardiovascular system<br>and so therefore even the smallest<br>amount of stress led to a breakdown in<br>the communication between the heart and<br>the brain so there was this increase in<br>sympathetic nerve activity<br>which facilitated or exacerbated the<br>onset of heart disease as well as<br>vascular disease<br>so these results were were sort of<br>painting the picture that ghrelin is<br>like a life jacket or a bike helmet when<br>you're wearing them you don't really<br>notice them they're not really doing<br>anything right it's when you fall in the<br>water or fall off your bike that they<br>become noticeable because they protect<br>you<br>ghrelin is the same we don't really have<br>an idea of what it's doing under normal<br>circumstances but when your<br>cardiovascular system is challenged<br>ghrelin is one of the ones that comes to<br>your rescue<br>so what are the outcomes from all of<br>this research<br>I am incredibly privileged<br>and honored to say that a lot of this<br>work has been published in reputable<br>journals it has advanced our knowledge<br>and our understanding of the<br>cardiovascular system and the role of<br>ghrelin in it<br>um and I can see how it has the<br>potential to impact on future clinical<br>practice<br>but<br>as someone of Pacific descent<br>I can't help but think that this<br>research doesn't really address the<br>disparity when we look at the prevalence<br>of cardiovascular disease between<br>it is widely accepted that<br>cardiovascular disease<br>disproportionately affects Pacific<br>people<br>with Pacific people two to three times<br>more likely to suffer from some form of<br>cardiovascular disease compared to New<br>Zealand European people<br>not only that pacific people tend to<br>experience the cardiovascular disease<br>much more severely and at a much younger<br>age<br>and the question is why do we have this<br>disparity<br>and to be honest I don't know there are<br>a multi multitude of reasons<br>many of which need to be explored<br>but given my I guess my background and<br>my experience the question that comes to<br>mind for me is<br>maybe Pacific people have a low level of<br>growing<br>could this be a contributing factor<br>and so this is what started the Journey<br>I must acknowledge at this point in time<br>the great leadership of family professor<br>of<br>who has been instrumental Who has been a<br>powerful voice of Pacific within the<br>division of Health Sciences within the<br>university as a whole and was an<br>important Mentor for I guess<br>reinstilling a pride of the Pacific<br>within so many of the staff with here at<br>the University<br>um and so she was one of the I guess<br>instigators of asking me the question<br>Daryl what about the Pacific<br>and this is what started the whole<br>there's a famous Samoan proverb that<br>says<br>which means<br>the pathway to leadership is through<br>service<br>and I think Tai epitomizes<br>and this very proverb<br>and has encouraged many of us other<br>Pacific staff to embrace this proverb as<br>well<br>so with that in mind within New Zealand<br>I had a student Italy I see her up there<br>we we decided to look at the circulating<br>levels of karelin and Pacific versus<br>non-pacific and what what really<br>staggered me is that pacific people<br>have less than half the amount of<br>ghrelin<br>the New Zealand European populations<br>now earlier slides we showed that with<br>low levels of ghrelin you've lost this<br>protective factor for your<br>cardiovascular system<br>so what we now need to ask is what is<br>the impact of the slow level ghrelin and<br>Pacific people when it comes to this<br>brain heart Communication in other words<br>the sympathetic nerve activity how does<br>this low ghrelin impact on the<br>cardiovascular system as a whole in<br>Pacific people<br>maybe it is that this low level of<br>ghrelin is the reason they are<br>predisposed to cardiovascular disease in<br>the first place<br>another question is in this particular<br>study we were just looking at New<br>Zealand Pacific people<br>could a westernized society predispose<br>Pacific people to cardiovascular disease<br>is there a difference between Pacific<br>here in New Zealand born and raised<br>versus those born and raised in the<br>islands<br>and so this gave way to<br>um<br>favorable funding from the health<br>research Council to start addressing<br>this very question<br>and as Lisa alluded to before we were<br>successful in getting funding for this<br>project called Ken loss of a hunger<br>hormone which is gorillin increased<br>cardiovascular disease in Pacific people<br>and so therefore I was fortunate enough<br>um to to recruit a team from around the<br>Pacific first of all we have asiat<br>Professor sataviali who is a cardio<br>cardiologist based in the National<br>National University of Samoa we have<br>James Fisher based in the University of<br>Auckland we have Dr Alamanda based in<br>Christchurch and then there's Qatar<br>and so collectively what we're doing is<br>trying to address the question<br>how is the the cardiovascular health in<br>our Pacific people<br>respondent to ghrelin<br>do they respond positively much more<br>than than non-pacific which would<br>explain why they are predisposed to<br>cardiovascular disease<br>is there a difference between Pacific<br>people here in New Zealand and in Samoa<br>and to do that we need to take this<br>research to Samoa<br>and so just as it was a privilege to<br>experience and observe the culture of<br>Japan so too it is to experience the<br>serenity of Samoa<br>um I highly recommend for any of you who<br>haven't been to Summer to please visit<br>so you truly unique culture<br>the research itself will be done will be<br>conducted in the main city of Samoa<br>which is up here<br>and it will be conducted at the National<br>University of Samoa which is just down<br>the road from where my family live<br>so it will be good to<br>in essence return home<br>we will also be able to recruit the the<br>services of this scientific research<br>office of Samoa which will also be<br>what are the desired outcomes of This<br>research<br>as much as much as I think Publications<br>what I would really prefer is to see<br>outcome when it comes to the people<br>is more important than family<br>so what I'd love to see is that through<br>working with ghrelin and our Pacific<br>people we can reduce this disparity that<br>currently exists with prevalence of<br>so tonight I've taken you through the<br>Journey starting in summer coming to New<br>Zealand<br>interacting with<br>Japan Australia before returning back to<br>but let me share with you that this<br>journey still continues and it will be<br>as I've gone through this journey I like<br>to I guess make the analogy that it's<br>like<br>traveling in the VA or the Waka<br>where we're paddling through through<br>stormy waters<br>but this is not a solo Journey<br>no individual can navigate<br>or a canoe by themselves<br>takes a lot of effort<br>so for me my navigator has been<br>and the incredibly rich<br>at the beginning I I asked the question<br>why are you who am I<br>and the question the answer to that<br>throughout this journey um<br>you know it's really hard to pedal on<br>one side<br>I needed a co-partner to be paddling on<br>Jane<br>I don't really know I don't have the<br>progress has been limited by the<br>Barnacles attached<br>to the Waka<br>so I need to acknowledge my children<br>thank you Zachary faith and Esha<br>but seriously they are a true Joy<br>ayinger or family is so critically<br>important<br>and I cannot say<br>how privileged I am<br>to know that every time I go to work in<br>the department of physiology I'm not<br>going to colleagues I'm going to family<br>each and every one of you I<br>am truly humbled<br>by<br>the feeling of family when working with<br>I'm not too sure how many workplaces can<br>say that but<br>it is a privilege<br>it is a joy to work with all of you<br>sorry I couldn't name everyone and I<br>don't have photos of everyone but just a<br>few people that have stood out<br>um<br>I did want to highlight that we tried to<br>reenact sitting in the Waka in that one<br>chair the four of us tried to squeeze in<br>the fitness came about with Rebecca and<br>I are trying to do runs together<br>and then finally I just need to also<br>acknowledge my cultural identity in<br>Samoa and I think it's been<br>inspirational to have the support of<br>both the Pacific island Center but also<br>the Central Pacific health<br>both the leaders in that group those<br>those teams and the team members<br>themselves<br>as the proverb says there is nothing<br>more important than family<br>family extends just beyond my immediate<br>family but to my colleagues<br>um<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>I was going to talk for 10-15 minutes<br>um<br>so I'm the head of department for<br>physiology but before that I know Daryl<br>has a friend as a colleague and every<br>day of every day I guess we discuss a<br>lot of things<br>starting from personal to professional<br>and so it's a great colleague and it's a<br>privilege to talk thank Daryl so Daryl<br>congratulations on your professor being<br>promoted to a professor it's well<br>deserved and thank you for a talk that<br>showcased many of your strengths not<br>only research but how you are engaging<br>with the community and the family<br>and I can say that your passion in<br>cardiovascular physiology which started<br>interestingly we were trying to get the<br>communication between brain and the<br>Heart it's amazing<br>and your keen understanding to<br>understand you're Keen to understand how<br>the hormone the grilling which works and<br>which communicates with the heart that's<br>amazing I'm sure with the results you<br>have it shouldn't be too soon to go into<br>the clinical trial but I can't say<br>already you are doing you're trying to<br>take that to the community that's that's<br>great thank you very much<br>and it's uh it's very well understood<br>that you're always trying to get the new<br>technologies so gain a synchrotron<br>radiation is one of the example which I<br>know I've been using it and that's a<br>great technology you brought in you<br>introduce it to the department and also<br>many newsletters thank you so much for<br>that<br>and it's of no surprise saying this all<br>the results you're starting to get big<br>fundings and I'm sure that would be<br>continuing as it is so you are told a<br>lot so I don't know I mean Lisa already<br>told it about many about your<br>achievements so I don't need to repeat<br>that so thank you so much for being a<br>wonderful colleague wonderful colleague<br>to everyone a lot of lot of everyone to<br>the department we all love your prank<br>I was I was hoping that you're going to<br>start your<br>professorial lecture with some sort of<br>prank but you didn't do that<br>and I am thanks thanks to you that you<br>did not show many photos which you took<br>in synchrotron which we didn't want to<br>show outside<br>thank you so much and we are hoping we<br>are looking forward to your continued<br>Journey so I would like to invite<br>everyone to join again thanking me Daryl<br>for this wonderful journey and all the<br>best to continue the great journey<br>and I have a small token of appreciation<br>for Daryl so maybe you should come this<br>side<br>uh just for the video you can see this<br>and for thanking your service and for<br>this great talk congratulations once<br>again and thank you<br>warm Pacific greetings<br>um my name is Neil Gamel I'm the acting<br>Deputy Pro Vice Chancellor for Health<br>Sciences so I have a very simple job<br>which is actually just thank you all for<br>your attendance this evening<br>um but I want to get an ending to invite<br>you for for drinks and and some uh some<br>food<br>but I just want to reflect uh Daryl<br>thank you very much on what was<br>wonderful and very heartfelt IPL where<br>you've you've taken us on a journey<br>which I think has touched us all this<br>evening so thank you for that<br>um I want to acknowledge you as a<br>amazing colleague and researcher<br>and of course I know you best through<br>your contributions as our associate Dean<br>Pacific in the school of biomedical<br>sciences and I thank you very much for<br>the service that you have undertaken on<br>behalf of the school and the division of<br>the University<br>um so I think I'll just say thank you<br>um I'm slightly lost for words too I<br>think it was a wonderful IPL a great<br>oration<br>um good bit of humor there I think Pat<br>will probably forgive you<br>um and so just please again join with me<br>in thanking Daryl schwenke for a<br>wonderful IPL<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
