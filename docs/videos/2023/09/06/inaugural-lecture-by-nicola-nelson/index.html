In this lecture Professor Nicky Nelson will present research case studies into the biology of tuatara, showing how they have supported the removal of tuatara from the threat list and empowered iwi to manage their taonga. These case studies also demonstrate the risk to reptiles with climate warming.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be

enormous privilege to welcome<br>friends family distinguished guests<br>academic professional colleagues<br>students in our wider Community to the<br>inaugural lecture of Nicola Nelson who<br>is a professor of biological sciences<br>um as as the custom at these events I<br>have a long list of achievements which<br>have been garnered from Nicola or Nikki<br>as we know her CV and I would like to<br>highlight just a few of those but I also<br>want to talk a little bit about some of<br>the the personal elements and the<br>personal stories of her time which I<br>think we will hear more of in her<br>inaugural lecture<br>Professor Nelson was educated at a<br>university a little further south of<br>this one the University of Canterbury<br>which did a Bachelor of Science and<br>plant and microbial Sciences<br>um but then she she came to this fine<br>institution to complete a master of<br>conservation and a PhD in Zoology<br>she did that in part while working at<br>tahit angawaka as a technician in school<br>of biological sciences before heading to<br>the U.S uh where she did her postdoc in<br>um<br>she then following that secured a<br>position back here and for those who<br>know<br>Professor Nelson's work we are<br>incredibly lucky to have her<br>she's an interdisciplinary researcher<br>combines fields of ecophysiology sex<br>determination population ecology<br>conservation and evolution<br>and in doing so studies one of the<br>iconic species of this country in<br>arteroa the turatara<br>she's widely recognized in her field and<br>the way that academics do where we<br>collect metrics around funding which has<br>been raised<br>um<br>imminent journals of which there are now<br>over a hundred which are widely cited<br>across all those fields but she also has<br>has shown really significant academic<br>leadership<br>she has uh held ministerial appointments<br>as Deputy chair of the Wellington<br>Hawke's Bay conservation board she's<br>been Community Representatives I'm in a<br>number of regional elements she's been<br>being both President and Vice President<br>of the society for research of<br>amphibians and reptiles of New Zealand I<br>mean most recently as president-elect<br>for the Society of conservation biology<br>in Oceania<br>she's made significant contributions at<br>the University as well she was head of<br>the school of biological sciences for a<br>number of years which included<br>navigating the university through covert<br>and she told me just a few minutes ago<br>that part of her process of dealing with<br>the stress and challenge of that role<br>was to sing loudly with enthusiasm as<br>each each morning and I'm also told that<br>she is known as part of her academic<br>role to sometimes to go to work in a<br>helicopter<br>which I I don't think is necessarily a<br>great symbiotic relationship with the<br>singing But but there we go<br>um she's also made significant impacts<br>on the ecology research in aotearo she<br>has been integral to funding nine new<br>populations of tuatara and the<br>augmentations of four others and through<br>that field work that is used to Ferry<br>her via helicopters to islands around<br>that process she's been integrally<br>involved in conservation and management<br>activities tertiary education Outreach<br>that Outreach has elevated her status<br>further in this institution where she is<br>known to be one of the preeminent<br>celebrity Duos of the University<br>Nicky and and Spike are often the prize<br>attraction<br>for people as they come through and meet<br>this exercise I tried to extend this<br>metaphor with it a few moments ago and<br>she wasn't interested although the<br>singing I think is relevant to suggest<br>that it's just the sunny and share of<br>the University<br>um Sony was the the front act to begin<br>with but the brains and the talent and<br>the singing and the operation was<br>clearly sheer in this particular process<br>she has a outside the university she<br>lives on a lifestyle walk in<br>martinborough with her husband and two<br>boys I understand one of her boys is<br>working on assessments and can't be here<br>tonight but she is again even more<br>popular in her school for bringing<br>buckets of feijoas with regularity<br>sometimes they're used as fundraisers<br>for the first to live in hockey which he<br>also manages but they are a key part to<br>her gardening aspirations which she from<br>my perspective also interestingly<br>combines with a passion for windsurfing<br>uh at this lecture Professor Nelson will<br>present research case studies into the<br>biology of Spike and tuataras more<br>generally so show how they supported the<br>removal of turutara from the threat list<br>in New Zealand and how ewe had been<br>empowered to manage their tawanga in<br>that context<br>acknowledging her achievements<br>acknowledging the value that she<br>provides to this University it is my<br>enormous pleasure to introduce Professor<br>um I'm gonna start with my family uh<br>this is part of my history and um<br>I've organized myself into stories with<br>some notes to keep me on task so uh to<br>start with I think I spent some really<br>formative years in the Cook Islands<br>um Dad set up the my family's here in<br>the front row dad set up the dsir<br>research station in the Cook Islands in<br>Rarotonga and we're exposed to all sorts<br>of things during that time<br>and this included things like the the<br>diseases of fruit bats that I got to see<br>up close and personal watching out for<br>taramiya or crown of thorns and invasive<br>um sea creature that when we're swimming<br>and<br>um the Smithsonian coming to claim the<br>last of the rarotongan flycatchers not<br>for conservation purposes but for esteem<br>and Dad saying well where's your permit<br>kind of stuff so<br>um this background I guess at some point<br>I must have shown some enthusiasm for<br>Science and<br>um I think at the time Dad said<br>something like don't be a scientist<br>um but I do like a challenge<br>so fast forward a few years<br>um I did my BSC at Canterbury this is<br>not an advert and then I got a job here<br>at Vic as a technician and I was really<br>lucky as a technician to have huge<br>opportunities to do research as part of<br>my job<br>and I was even luckier when Sue broke a<br>limb and I got to go to hoturu a little<br>Barrier Island<br>um off the coast of Auckland and this<br>and many other places remote places with<br>amazing New Zealand fauna was an<br>opportunity for me that I hadn't had<br>before and I thought I want to go back<br>to study<br>and so actually the duo would spike is<br>Sue shown here with a very large Toyota<br>and Charlie Doherty so I went to Charlie<br>and I said<br>um I want to go it to study<br>um I I don't want to do something that's<br>just academic I want to make a<br>difference and Nod to the scientists<br>comment before<br>and so I have had enormous opportunities<br>with this team who've become you know<br>not I'm not only my mentor but friends<br>um over decades to be involved in<br>research and to continue to study<br>I'd also like to note here as a member<br>of the health and safety committee<br>that Charlie is not in correct PPE<br>and perhaps not following our off-campus<br>policy but he's at a different event<br>okay so my focus my research Focus has<br>been on Tuatara<br>um they're an amazingly magnificent<br>animal and I feel very privileged to<br>have worked on them<br>uh they're a unique species they are<br>only found in New Zealand they're in<br>their own order so there is different<br>from lizards as they are from Turtles<br>and crocodiles there's one species only<br>from New Zealand<br>um<br>they're also a tongue of New Zealand so<br>they're very important to Maori people<br>and<br>um<br>I guess early on in my career I was a<br>little concerned about focusing on just<br>one species so I had a chat with a<br>colleague on a plane and I said you know<br>am I still you know a little bit<br>restricted here and he said well I've<br>been reading a book about publication<br>strategies<br>it's okay<br>you're a rhinoceros you dump in one<br>place<br>hippopotamuses spread their Publications<br>in many areas so moving on I had to<br>include Pooh in a talk from a biologist<br>so that's my tokens yesterday okay so<br>moving on um what have what I've what<br>have I been up to I've been here since<br>1990 and many roles student technician<br>academic and um so what I've done is<br>packaged my talk into a couple of<br>stories if you want more of the science<br>behind it we can talk later the first<br>one is about time because a lot of what<br>I do is related to doing things over a<br>uh first bit is about aging we don't<br>know how to age tutara appropriately<br>this is Phoebe who lived in our<br>enclosure for decades and Phoebe is old<br>that's what I can say about her age<br>she looked old when we got her she<br>looked like she would become she looked<br>like she would die soon so she she was<br>going to be a museum specimen and she<br>looked old for 40 years longer<br>okay but what we do know about aging is<br>we have hatched animals and we've<br>hatched hundreds peps in the thousands<br>of of individuals here at the University<br>and these will be a great foundation for<br>we also have the luxury of a couple of<br>islands where<br>people marked animals in the 40s and 50s<br>and we can still catch them<br>and so we have records of animals that<br>we've caught<br>60 years on from when they were marked<br>and some of those individuals were full<br>adult size when they were marked so how<br>do we get to aging Tuatara well we can<br>confidently say they live longer than<br>60.<br>but we can say that perhaps they were of<br>just of adult size when they were marked<br>and that's maybe 30 years so they can<br>possibly live 90 years but maybe they<br>were 60 when they were first marked and<br>so that's you know getting on to 120<br>years so let's just go with in the<br>vicinity of a hundred<br>what else do we know because we've<br>marked animals on these islands and been<br>and done recapture work just all sorts<br>of cool details I'm going to just talk<br>about a few of them<br>so uh we know that they<br>are sexually mature in their teens but<br>don't always contribute to um to the<br>population at that time in fact<br>I'll talk over your phone don't you<br>worry uh in fact<br>um males may not only only the the<br>biggest 20 of males May contribute to<br>the next Generations you have to be a<br>big boy to even be in the in the game<br>females<br>um reproduce every two to five years but<br>if they're in poorer conditions less<br>food then maybe they only go to<br>reproduce every 10 maybe even longer<br>and we've contributed our Mac we capture<br>to an international study which has<br>looked at a a cross-section of many many<br>species of reptiles and words like<br>um negligible aging have been used to<br>describe Tuatara what that means is<br>things like they have about over 95<br>annual survival so if you get to be an<br>adult to Atara you have a very low<br>chance of dying there's a huge chance of<br>and this is an Ode to a tariff done well<br>to get out of her burrow and sit on a<br>log but we don't know how old<br>the um the study that we contributed<br>data to from North brother Island<br>estimates that Tuatara may live though<br>okay so if you think about Tuatara can<br>live a long time and you think about a<br>hundred years now that's not really a<br>number that we use to think about very<br>often it's not something we think about<br>in grant funding terms it's not<br>something we think about an election<br>Cycles<br>but it is something we think about with<br>climate change that hundred year<br>time for the predictions for climate<br>change that's the lifespan of individual<br>Tuatara so when we think about what will<br>be the impact of global warming on<br>Tuatara<br>um<br>100 years it's not that big a time frame<br>to think about and so my next story is<br>about sex determination and that's<br>because Tuatara have a very weird sex<br>determining pattern<br>this is Tuatara mating<br>male on top female underneath I'm not<br>going to talk at all about mating<br>except to say that Tuatara mate and eggs<br>are fertilized just much like you know<br>your dad's sperm met your mum's egg<br>the egg was fertilized okay so at that<br>point that's all the same as what might<br>happen to mammals but at that time your<br>sex was determined<br>with Twitter that's not the case six is<br>not determined until the middle third of<br>incubation so that's when all the other<br>organs are developing<br>the gonads make a decision to go into<br>the male or female pathway and that's<br>based on the temperature of the eggs at<br>the time<br>and so if you're an egg and a nest and<br>around February the sex has been<br>determined then at the height of the<br>temperatures on an island in Cook Strait<br>in the sex determination pattern is Not<br>Unusual to<br>um reptiles lots of reptiles have this<br>temperature dependent sex determination<br>but no other reptiles do we know that it<br>works the same way as in Tuatara which<br>is where if you have warm temperatures<br>you get males if you have cold<br>temperatures you get females so it's the<br>opposite pattern to what you'd expect<br>from say sea turtles<br>and so these are told not to include too<br>many graphs so this is one these graphs<br>show temperature records of the data<br>loggers that are in the nest there that<br>measure temperature every hour for a<br>year<br>so the temperature goes up and down<br>every day on the bottom Nest sometimes<br>15 degrees Celsius in a day<br>and you can see the temperature going<br>through summer where it goes high and<br>then through winter where it goes low<br>and the line across is 21 degrees<br>Celsius so if you incubate eggs in an<br>incubator dial it up you know in the lab<br>and you put your eggs in at 22 degrees<br>you'll get males out of those incubated<br>eggs if you put it at 21 or below you'll<br>get females so a nest profile like the<br>top one is a cool Nest where the<br>temperatures hardly get above 21 degrees<br>and the eggs out of a nest like that<br>will turn out to be females<br>whereas the bottom Nest which spins<br>almost all of its time in January to<br>March which is the heat of the the<br>period of temperature on the island and<br>the time when the sex is determined eggs<br>and nests like that will be boys<br>and most of what we know about Tuatara<br>and their biology but most especially<br>about their sex determination is from<br>takapotewa or Stevens Island and I<br>acknowledge natikara as the kaitiaki for<br>this island<br>so some little tidbits I guess again<br>about the the sex determination story<br>um Tuatara will lay eggs in open areas<br>in Cook Strait we don't know so much<br>about how they nest in more Northern<br>places but in Cook Strait they like to<br>nest in open areas if they nest in<br>Forest they're unsuccessful<br>this island has been highly Modified by<br>the lighthouse Keepers so those open<br>areas are sheep paddocks and that was<br>the probably the key to there being now<br>hugely successful population growth on<br>that island to the point where it's<br>estimated to have 30 to 50 000 Tuatara<br>on it<br>it's the motherload so that's where we<br>can actually find nests and sea meetings<br>and study some of the biology that's<br>highly cryptic<br>to attire I like to nest in these open<br>rookeries and if they nest in different<br>locations we get different sexes<br>so if they nest and call up sites that<br>have more Brown loamy wetter soils with<br>not as much sun exposure will get<br>females out of those nests if they nest<br>in open areas where the sun is tracking<br>for a lot of the day the the Sandy soils<br>get warmer then we'll get boys out of<br>those nests<br>um we also think that they dig their<br>nests for Success they'll dig a nest in<br>exactly the same places they dug it two<br>years ago five years ago or within four<br>meters of where they last dug that Nest<br>so incredibly reliably going back to the<br>same places so although they choose to<br>nest for success and they seem to dig<br>the same depth no matter where they're<br>nesting no matter what soil type it is<br>no matter how hard it is to dig<br>they're generally doing it in the same<br>way as individual females but because<br>they're doing it in a whole lot of<br>different locations we get both sexes<br>so the key to having both sexes is<br>I'm just going to check where I'm at<br>because I'm really going off base here<br>okay and baby Tuatara result there we go<br>okay what we what we also know about<br>nesting though is that because Tuatara<br>nesting for success and doing it at the<br>same relatively the same depths<br>they're not actually paying attention to<br>what the environment is like as far as<br>if it's a warm year they don't do things<br>differently from what we can tell at<br>this point so a result of that is if we<br>get warmer than average years we're more<br>likely to get male hatchlings out of<br>those years I don't know if you've seen<br>this graph but it's from the newer<br>website which has an enormous amount of<br>information about climate climate<br>warming and this graph is showing us in<br>Ridge those years that are warmer than<br>average and in blue those years that are<br>cooler in average and average is the<br>determined is that those 30 years at the<br>end of the 1900s so 1971 to 2000 and the<br>concerning thing is that we expect more<br>red bars in the future that dotted line<br>is showing the trend we're expecting<br>more warmer than average years not every<br>year but more of them and the concern<br>for Tuatara going into the future is<br>that more warm years will mean more male<br>production how will we maintain a viable<br>populations of Tuatara with their<br>specific sex determining pattern<br>and that you know one of the the short<br>story about it is on takapote at this<br>point we think it's okay we think<br>there's still a 50<br>um male female population<br>however another Island where we have<br>fantastic long-term data and macro<br>capture studies as North brother now<br>North brother is The Rock Lighthouse of<br>New Zealand if you're going<br>um to the Marlborough sounds from<br>Wellington you're on the ferry you're<br>just about to go out of the rough stuff<br>and tutorial Channel if you look North<br>right there's a rock with a lighthouse<br>this is it and that whole slope there<br>faces North so North facing soils<br>shallow soils on a rocky habitat<br>Our concern here is that there's a male<br>producing environment and in fact what<br>we have found and this goes way back to<br>my Master's work is that there is a male<br>biased population on this island and so<br>the story here we think is one that has<br>the potential to be an Extinction Vortex<br>a special story perhaps for Norse<br>brother Island may not apply to all<br>islands and may not pan out like this<br>but I'll get back to that shortly<br>so there's a male birth population on<br>the island at that point it was in the<br>high 50 percent males<br>and the thing with Tuatara is the males<br>are bigger<br>the males are bigger they are more<br>dominant over the habitat they are more<br>likely to get the food which is limited<br>on a rock in Cook Strait<br>so if you've got males accessing the<br>food and them more of them then that has<br>a detrimental effect on the females and<br>so what we're watching is a population<br>with all sorts of parameters that link<br>to that kind of idea that started out at<br>carrying capacity<br>so they're all competing for food and in<br>fact both males and females declined in<br>condition and started to decline in<br>survival<br>and Twitter on this island are already<br>quite small because it's a rock and they<br>probably don't always have great supply<br>of resources and small females lay fewer<br>eggs so we're an average clutch on North<br>brother would be six eggs an average<br>clutch on the adjacent takapote would be<br>nine eggs so smaller females laying<br>fewer eggs but also recent data would<br>suggest that maybe those females are<br>only going to lay every say 11 to 14<br>years now<br>and when they lay eggs they're more<br>likely to be males particularly if it's<br>in warm years so there's a huge risk<br>modeling predicting Extinction of this<br>population not because we all lose<br>Tuatara from it but because they will be<br>all males<br>however<br>the part of the story is based on only<br>30 years of data for species individuals<br>that may live for a hundred years<br>perhaps not quite enough data to see<br>this cycle going through but also cool<br>things happen when populations drop to<br>say half carrying capacity that changes<br>the density dependent nature it there's<br>huge potential that we see this new new<br>cohort which comes into conditions that<br>are better for those individuals more<br>food per individual and so on for us to<br>see what happens next it will be<br>okay so I didn't want to uh just stop on<br>Doom and Gloom on that one so I chose<br>the next story to be about restoration<br>so we've incubated a lot of eggs and um<br>when you get a perm or permits up the<br>Wazoo for this kind of work by the way<br>when you get a permit to incubate eggs<br>you have to allow the fact that they<br>will be successfully hatched because<br>that's what people want to happen<br>obviously for a tonga species and then<br>you have to plan for where they will go<br>so we have had lots of uh interactions<br>really great opportunities to be part of<br>restoration projects<br>to understand the context for this I'll<br>take you back in time this is where<br>Toyota used to be<br>this is the pre-mammal map this is the<br>pre-human map we know where they used to<br>be from sub fossils that are in cave<br>deposits or sand dunes so we don't have<br>dots on the map where those two things<br>don't exist so we don't know absolutely<br>everywhere that Tuatara would have been<br>but this does tell us that they were not<br>just on Islands they were not just<br>Coastal species they were throughout the<br>mainland perhaps not the Southern Alps<br>um they were in places where there's<br>snow for several months of the year<br>they're not in all those places anymore<br>because of introduced mammalian<br>predators and I'm pretty certain this<br>audience knows enough about that to know<br>that that's not a tuatara that they're<br>eating but birds it's the same stories<br>with birds anywhere that rats cats<br>possums<br>mustelids stoats get to Tuatara cannot<br>survive there so at worst case we got to<br>32 Island populations of Tuatara none on<br>the mainland and some of those<br>populations just with a few individuals<br>and less than 10 hectares in size<br>however we're now in a mode of being<br>able to eradicate things like rats off<br>islands and so that coincided really<br>nicely with enormous productivity out of<br>our incubation experiments to think<br>about using those stock to repopulate<br>some of those locations that would have<br>had Tuatara in the past<br>now don't have rats so we can restore<br>them and a lot of the sweet was done in<br>partnership with so many people and this<br>is namanu nature reserve there was<br>another enclosure at Wellington Zoo<br>there were hundreds of babies at one<br>time<br>um being raised in these facilities and<br>I'll take this moment to say thank you<br>so much to everyone that we have worked<br>with because this is not something that<br>could have been done alone this is not<br>something that Nick's speech represented<br>very well at all this is collaborative<br>work with masses of students past and<br>present and just couldn't have done it<br>without you all<br>anyway moving on Head Start facility if<br>you raise babies up to be about five<br>years of age then it gives them a head<br>start so that not everything eats them<br>everything eats a baby Twitter even<br>adult Tuatara so it's a pretty dodgy<br>thing to be a baby and great<br>opportunities for research so some of<br>the things we've learned about baby<br>Tuatara about their growth about their<br>variability and growth is because of<br>kept of raising them we don't see baby<br>Tuatara much at all in the wild they're<br>hiding from everything<br>and we're buckets of Tuatara we have you<br>know all sorts of information on how how<br>fast they can grow how differently they<br>can grow we've had animals that we've<br>recapted at this age of 10 that look the<br>size of a hatchling<br>we've got a class that went up to Cape<br>Sanctuary for um a field class this year<br>who captured a really big Tuatara one we<br>hatched so we knew him he's 16 and he's<br>the biggest animal we caught there he's<br>bigger than the adults he's bigger now<br>than any we catch on the Founder Island<br>that he came from at 16. so we're<br>learning all sorts of things that<br>connect to our other stories that I've<br>told you<br>and we've moved them to new islands and<br>this has been amazing opportunity for<br>connections with people but also to<br>understand<br>how a translocation successes tracking<br>and so on and thank you to everyone who<br>supplied Glade wrap tubes<br>the first island translocation we did<br>was to TT Island which is in the outer<br>Marlborough sounds so when I were<br>dropped off there for five nights and we<br>released 68 animals in 1995 and we hope<br>to go back there this year which will<br>bring about more than 25 years on which<br>is kind of freaky to think about at all<br>but um perfect in terms of Tuatara<br>timing they will have had babies those<br>babies will now be big enough that we<br>can see them and catch them and big<br>enough so that we can sex them so now we<br>can start understanding what are the<br>Sexes being produced in our restoration<br>sites for example are they the Norse<br>brother story or are they they're the<br>takapote with story for example<br>and the short story around the<br>Restorations there were 32 populations<br>of Tuatara at worst we're up to over 45<br>populations of tuatala now on the<br>mainland<br>um and sanctuaries of course protected<br>and in all cases that I'm aware of<br>they're showing the signs of short-term<br>success babies are appearing in the<br>population Founders are found again<br>and they're living on and doing well in<br>those new locations and in fact one of<br>the stories I quite like is that um when<br>you put a Toyota in a new location they<br>can restart growing so if you put an<br>adult that you have seen for 10 years<br>prior and it's just stayed the same<br>length the whole time you put it in a<br>new location<br>like Matthew songs Island like zealandia<br>like TT and they start growing again<br>so that's not something we can do right<br>if we get more resources we just get<br>fatter but they can deploy it into<br>growth what we don't know is how they<br>can deploy it into reproduction females<br>and males probably have different<br>so this is a pattern a map of where<br>populations are now the blue dots are<br>represented of Island groups<br>um Tuatara were restricted to off the<br>east coast to the north island and in<br>Cook Strait the red dots are areas where<br>they've been restored to and these are<br>going to be such fantastic experiments<br>for us because they are spread<br>throughout the country one in orokanui<br>for example<br>probably the adults there will only<br>produce female hatchlings in the short<br>term<br>it's quite cool<br>um lots of opportunities for research<br>it's also been about other um let's call<br>it collateral benefits and this is<br>Charlie with uh Tuatara when we moved<br>them to match usomes Island our amazing<br>advocacy tool you can pull it to a<br>tutter out and you can have a<br>conversation with anyone about anything<br>amazing opportunity to reconnect with<br>ewe and so this ewi natakuata on<br>takapotewa they used to sit fishing off<br>the island in Ireland that we were able<br>to visit and they were not allowed to<br>visit like actually not allowed and that<br>was at a time when permits were quite<br>hard to get and permits for work for<br>research only<br>so as part of the research as part of<br>the translocations this has been amazing<br>opportunity for them to reconnect with<br>an island that they now co-manage<br>and talk to them about how to engage and<br>get more capacity to actually manage the<br>island which they'd had a real<br>disconnect with for um more than 100<br>years<br>and this has included stories like Lou<br>Lou Paul who um now has a voice within<br>doc I would say around policy has helped<br>Drive the captive management policy<br>which has an influence on how animals<br>are moved internationally and how<br>captive animals can now be used to help<br>with the restoration of islands as well<br>which is something that couldn't happen<br>before partly because of all the<br>difficult Eerie conversations that their<br>their were to be had<br>to the point where Nazi quotes are in a<br>position to lead their own translocation<br>in their own region and including<br>learning techniques like bleeding<br>for collecting disease samples for<br>example which is not something that we<br>have necessarily been interested or able<br>okay my fourth story is around fecal<br>matters because I'm a biologist and I<br>is a fantastic example<br>of a poo it's fresh<br>you can see what the animal ate and it<br>has some parasites<br>so this is a way just to talk a little<br>bit about disease ecology it's<br>gratuitous I know okay so tutara live on<br>islands and often uh these islands<br>especially the Relic Islands have masses<br>of sea birds on them I said there's 30<br>to 50 Tuatara on takapote where there's<br>a million fairy primes and other species<br>and they're Landing all around you and<br>they're pooing on absolutely everything<br>if you're a tuatara sitting there on a<br>log looking still a very Prime will land<br>on it and you see these big white<br>streaks down them<br>so there's a lot of connectivity in the<br>system but the interesting thing is<br>around the disease ecology<br>for example<br>we don't think they get salmonella<br>but birds have it<br>almost every other reptile has it why is<br>that the case are they innately immune<br>to it<br>or are they just too cold to grow<br>salmonella salmonella likes to live at<br>37 degrees Celsius on a plate in the<br>incubator these guys will never get to<br>that temperature that would kill them<br>and if they get to the high 20s they're<br>they're pretty happy so is it that<br>Tuatara and not maintaining a body<br>temperature at the moment that allows<br>them to<br>incubate salmonella successfully we<br>don't know so the idea here is that we<br>don't know a lot about the disease<br>ecology and<br>if I just come back to the climate<br>warming part of the story this is of<br>strong interest and potentially concern<br>into the future so these are two maps<br>again you can find these on the newer<br>websites these are from the ministry for<br>the environment in fact<br>the left hand one is the temperature<br>projections for New Zealand<br>if it's a darker red then it's going to<br>get hotter<br>relative to what it is now on the right<br>hand side is the water representation<br>and if it's gonna get very much weaker<br>it's in dark blue if it's going to get<br>very much drier it's in red now if you<br>think about where our Sanctuary<br>populations are now what a great<br>opportunity to understand disease<br>ecology for animals that we've moved<br>from Cook Strait to say Hawkes Bay where<br>it's going to get drier and warmer or to<br>mangatotri which is near Hamilton where<br>it's going to get significantly warmer<br>for example so these disease ecology<br>let's call them Baseline information<br>that we have will be really set us up<br>for understanding climate warming and<br>understanding how we can then think<br>about restoring populations for example<br>right that's my stories I just wanted to<br>take a chance to have some Reflections<br>um the first one is<br>that guy is dead there's no doubt about<br>that we saw him once little Tuatara have<br>a very hard time but if you get to be an<br>adult<br>just wait for 100 years<br>become one is ethically we've moved on a<br>lot these guys will drop their tails so<br>what are these 1915 this photo was taken<br>San Francisco Zoo collecting animals<br>also bad idea they're all males not<br>so we've got this amazing Tonga there's<br>so much we've got to learn even though<br>um I focused my whole talk on it I<br>represent one of perhaps three to five<br>generations of researchers depending on<br>how kind I'm being to those people of<br>some of whom are in the room and how old<br>I'm feeling myself<br>um there's still not enough to really<br>understand so it's a really good uh um<br>Pitch I guess opportunity to say that<br>you know actually we need succession<br>plan for researchers if we're to<br>continue to learn about species just<br>because Tuatara are now on 45<br>populations and off the threat list<br>it doesn't mean we can let off on them<br>because in fact as soon as rats get to<br>an island that's it for that population<br>so much more to learn<br>but I have focused on toots and I want<br>to acknowledge that that was because I<br>could but there's actually 125 or more<br>species of other reptiles in New Zealand<br>the skinks and the geckos and they're<br>amazing too and we know nothing about<br>and we continue to develop areas where<br>we have our species our protected<br>species All Reptiles and New Zealand are<br>protected we continue to develop the<br>areas like Cobham Drive cycleway<br>our animals are in the face of<br>development and we have very poor ways<br>of managing that process we assume we<br>can move them like we do conservation<br>translocations and that they will be<br>okay but we don't do them the<br>translocations in any way like the same<br>way we don't take the same care so<br>there's a whole lot of our protected<br>species in front of diggers where we can<br>contribute so much more to learn about<br>their biology and contribute to their<br>management<br>um and so this is in the wrap up and I I<br>try to think how to thank people and I<br>couldn't get the font size big enough so<br>that you would be able to see them so<br>I've just chosen one picture which I<br>really like and this is a picture of my<br>first grad students who've come together<br>again with their babies<br>now first of all there's a strong female<br>bias there<br>that is not something that would have<br>happened when I was a fresh young thing<br>at Canterbury<br>in grade school and the second<br>generation that is not something that<br>was exposed to me as a young grad<br>student either so I I like it for those<br>reasons but also to just to say thank<br>you to I've got some of my former<br>students here today and some of my<br>current students here today and I'm<br>really grateful for all that we've been<br>I also want to thank my sb's colleagues<br>and my other colleagues around<br>throughout the university because<br>um received enormous Support over the<br>time particularly through my years as<br>head of school I'm really grateful for<br>that support<br>you're awesome<br>and finally I want to come back to my<br>family<br>um I've got the male biased<br>representation here today by Sue<br>thank you for supporting me through this<br>journey and for keeping me grounded they<br>will take the purse out of me because of<br>Nick's speech earlier for decades to<br>come but anyway my main point I guess is<br>I'm really lucky to have such a great<br>opportunity and I can't believe I have a<br>job where I get to do this kind of thing<br>so thank you very much I'm done<br>thank you<br>I'm Paul teacher spittle I'm an<br>associate Dean in the faculty of Science<br>and I've had the absolute pleasure of<br>being in the school of biological<br>sciences with Nikki for the last well 20<br>year olds so yes it's been a real<br>pleasure and so I'm totally delighted to<br>have the opportunity to give the voter<br>thanks<br>this evening<br>I'd also like to recognize Nick's family<br>and so we've got her dad John her<br>brother martin her husband Craig and<br>Toby as well some<br>and a whole host of friends and family<br>colleagues past and present and um<br>also to recognize Nick vastraser and and<br>Margaret says uh associate Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor research so<br>what an audience and what a pleasure to<br>hear from Nikki today<br>and we've also heard a few mentions of<br>Charlie Doherty so Charlie's not able to<br>be with us today we'd love to be here<br>but um there's a camera over there and<br>if you want to turn and wave at Charlie<br>he'll be seeing seeing this recording at<br>some point<br>right so we've heard tonight from Nikki<br>about some of the issues and some of the<br>some of the challenges facing this<br>tongue the species and her Reflections<br>on how those issues and challenges will<br>play out into the future<br>we've seen how important the insights<br>that she and the generations before her<br>and the generations that will follow her<br>as a result of the work she's done will<br>be in terms of protecting this<br>incredible species<br>we can see immediate impacts we've seen<br>that removal from the threat list<br>and the empowerment of ewe to manage<br>their town<br>and we've also noted the impacts of<br>climate change and the threats the risks<br>along the way Nick has mentioned a few<br>times the the interesting challenge of<br>working with the species that is so<br>long-lived that in fact you look at<br>generations of researchers to study one<br>generation of the species<br>and Nikki has highlighted for us the<br>importance of the work that she and<br>those other researchers are doing have<br>done are doing and will do into the<br>future<br>and that isn't just about the<br>conservation but it's about settings in<br>policy it's about building people's<br>understandings the engagement of the<br>communities<br>the vice Chancellor noted in his<br>introduction Nick has made incredible<br>contributions to the university during<br>her time<br>um she's been here for about 20 years<br>she's been a powerful presence within<br>biological sciences and within the<br>university as a whole she's passionate<br>she's energetic she's committed and I<br>think you've seen all of that tonight<br>but she's been an incredible leader<br>um to to uh to us within biological<br>sciences to us within the universities<br>so Nikki for that thank you so very very<br>much<br>her dedication as well to the<br>conservation you heard from Nick earlier<br>about that the boards that she's been<br>part of the influence she's had<br>throughout the nation and<br>internationally<br>you've heard of that those roles in<br>those International<br>groupings so Nikki we've been incredibly<br>lucky to have you here as a staff member<br>your passion the stuff that you do is<br>inspiring it's inspiring for those of us<br>who work with you it's been inspiring I<br>I'm sure as well for those who have<br>learned from you and studied with you<br>so it's been a pleasure to recognize<br>what a fantastic inaugural lecture<br>you've given us uh really<br>um think it's given us an incredible<br>we get an opportunity in a little while<br>to to meet and talk<br>um more about what Nikki has told us<br>about and to Ask Nikki questions don't<br>let it go away and with questions<br>unasked so we're going to go out into<br>the common room shortly for some<br>refreshments but as Nikki has hinted we<br>have a special guest here tonight so we<br>have Spike with us<br>and um Sue is going to to help people<br>introduce people to spike if you do come<br>forward to meet Spike please listen very<br>carefully to the instructions that Sue<br>gives you because that's absolutely<br>important to make sure that that spike<br>is available for future<br>um introductions to people<br>right<br>so<br>before we break for meeting Spike and<br>asking Nikki all those thorny questions<br>that you've been pondering about I'd<br>like to invite you once again to thank<br>Nikki for an incredible lecture this<br>evening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
