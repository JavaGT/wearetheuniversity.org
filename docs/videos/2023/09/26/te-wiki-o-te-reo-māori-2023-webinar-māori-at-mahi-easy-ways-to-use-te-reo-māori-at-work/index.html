started and I'll introduce<br>okay it looks like the numbers are um<br>sealing down pretty nicely now so I<br>think we'll go ahead and<br>and make a start<br>and I am a senior lecturer in the<br>business school here at the headingawaka<br>Victoria University of Wellington really<br>great to see so many of you here uh over<br>170 people in fact in our webinar today<br>to learn a little bit about uh using<br>teddel in the workplace so I full<br>disclosure I am not an academic whose<br>area of expertise is interior Maori I'm<br>just a fella who speaks Tyrion Maori and<br>has done since since I was young<br>um so that is the the angle I'm sort of<br>bringing to today's recording or I am<br>just approaching it as someone who<br>speaks Maori and and sharing hopefully<br>some useful and simple phrases with all<br>of you out there that you can hopefully<br>start using today in your own workplaces<br>um because when you think about it you<br>know for me like as an academic I study<br>workplaces I have a big interest in sort<br>of the The Human Side of management and<br>work and we spend a huge amount of our<br>time in these settings most of us right<br>um and so it to me it's really sort of<br>the workplace is really one of those<br>sort of untapped levers I think those<br>those places where we can<br>um really start to do a lot more to<br>revitalize today was by using it a lot<br>more in the workplace so that's the sort<br>of motivation for today's webinar<br>um what we're going to do is Step<br>through things in just three simple<br>categories and I've tried to think about<br>like my own work life what are some of<br>the most common situations where I find<br>myself using to do and it's really in<br>these three kind of situations so the<br>first one is nahui so in meetings<br>which is email openings another common<br>situation where we we see them being<br>used are seated or being used and the<br>last one is<br>which break times now you'll notice that<br>all of these different words have uh at<br>the start of them so those of you who<br>are maybe a little bit further along in<br>your terial journey might know what what<br>is used for in cereal but for those of<br>you who don't we put nah at the<br>beginning when it's a plural so if you<br>look at like this first one here if I<br>just said Hui then that would just be<br>meeting singular but if I say Hui then<br>I'm saying meetings plural right and so<br>that is the the device that's used in<br>terel as opposed to like in English we<br>we usually just put an S on the end of<br>the word right until we put at the start<br>to signify that it's plural uh so just a<br>little tip there if you're seeing around<br>all the time that's what it's for it's<br>referring to something and the plural<br>rather than the singular really really<br>common thing you see interior but let's<br>get started with some of these phrases<br>that you can use in uh in nahui and and<br>meetings right let's take that as our<br>first Port of Call so for me I mean if<br>you're if you're like me hopefully<br>you're not but one of the first things I<br>always find myself doing is saying sorry<br>for being late<br>um so if we wanted to say that into<br>deals sorry for my lateness how might we<br>do that well it would probably look a<br>little bit like this right and you'll<br>see throughout these slides I've used<br>the colors to indicate like the<br>approximate equivalent the the<br>equivalent interior of the English word<br>right so sorry would be arohamai<br>lateness 280 Tanga right and if we put<br>that all together if you wanted to say<br>sorry for my lateness you could say<br>sometimes people ask about the little<br>lines on top of some of the vowels those<br>are called interior we call them tohuto<br>or in English you call them macrons and<br>they signify that you hold the vowel for<br>a little bit longer<br>so with that word more it has you I<br>don't know maybe it might be hard to<br>hear<br>um but it's you just hold it for a touch<br>longer than you would usually right and<br>that can actually change the meaning of<br>the word a little bit like how and um<br>how in Chinese you know different<br>dialects there are tones to indicate<br>different words the the macron serves a<br>similar function in terial Maori but<br>that is how you would apologize to your<br>colleagues<br>um that that we're there at the end 280<br>means late<br>by itself so if you just want to say<br>late you would say 280 and when you put<br>Tanga on the end again I'm not a<br>linguist or anything so I don't know the<br>technical term for all of this but it<br>changes it to being from late to<br>lateness right so it changes that uh I<br>know that there's a technical<br>explanation for that but hopefully you<br>know what I mean<br>um it indicates the change there<br>another one that you might have often uh<br>in a Hui another thing you might want to<br>say is I have a question right so if you<br>wanted to say that in serial you'd<br>probably say it like this here<br>right and again the colors indicate<br>um the approximate sort of word<br>equivalence interior to English and<br>again we see our little friend the<br>macron popping up in that word party<br>right so it's not Tatai it's pathai you<br>hold the a for a little bit longer the<br>and then maybe another one you might<br>want to ask in a meeting although<br>depending on how long it's gone on for<br>maybe you just want to actually wrap<br>things up quickly and you don't want to<br>ask people if they have any questions<br>but if you do<br>here is how you would say that<br>um for one where you could say Interior<br>right<br>it's just really simply like this<br>um<br>right again we see the macron with both<br>of those words and you'll notice that if<br>I just go back to the previous slide<br>that it's actually a very similar<br>all that changes is the end to signify<br>the Target right are you are you saying<br>that I have a question or are you asking<br>someone else if they have one and that's<br>what we do by changing from taku to Tao<br>right<br>um<br>I see too that there's some questions<br>coming through in the in the chat in the<br>Q a so what I'll do is I'll just flick<br>through my stuff and then at the end<br>we've got 10 minutes for questions so<br>I'll be able to to work through all that<br>just to make sure we get through<br>everything so those are a few phrases<br>for uh for Hui things you can use uh in<br>a meeting<br>the next sets I know and I know for<br>those of you who are just starting out<br>with tidio the set of words might look<br>really long and confusing K2 pie don't<br>freak out<br>um I can actually because this isn't a<br>literal translation of email openings<br>right<br>um it's actually a way of saying a<br>similar thing<br>um but again we sing right which means<br>words<br>then we have fakatimata which means so<br>timata is begin or start and so<br>fakatimata means to begin or to start<br>right and then emitter emitter is a<br>transliteration it's just a Maori<br>sounding version of the English word<br>email and there's actually uh quite a<br>lot of those anterior<br>um which sort of if you're learning<br>makes it a bit easier because you can<br>you can sort of make the connection a<br>bit easier right so we have the words to<br>begin email that's what that means and<br>in English we would just say email<br>openings right but again a really common<br>thing that you would use in your work on<br>a day-to-day basis and I'm sure all of<br>us are very familiar with this one here<br>kyota right very very common and and I<br>would say aotearoa these days people use<br>it all the time which is awesome to see<br>it's changed a lot from you know even<br>when I was was growing up you hear kyota<br>being used all the time in shops and<br>that kind of stuff and and for me like<br>when I I see this in an email I kind of<br>think of it it's like the Toyota Corolla<br>of email openings you know it's like<br>it's really reliable it's trusty you<br>can't go wrong with it everyone kind of<br>knows it and and and has good feelings<br>about it right so kyota Toyota Corolla<br>of of Terrell email openings awesome<br>fine if you're using that one keep using<br>that but if you do want to maybe like<br>you know upgrade to something a bit more<br>uh edgy or you know interesting no<br>offense to any Toyota Corolla Owners out<br>there like I said everyone loves the<br>Corolla but there are a few options and<br>I thought we could step through some of<br>those<br>um over the next little bit the first<br>one is again quite a common phrase that<br>we use to greet incidio and it many of<br>you have probably heard but it's tier<br>naquer right and it's sort of similar to<br>Kyoto but it basically just means like<br>greetings to you it's uh when I see<br>people using 10 nakware as a Maori<br>speaker I'm kind of like okay like<br>you've kind of you're just taking that<br>little bit extra step to use something a<br>little bit different from the standard<br>Kyoto right<br>um which is always really cool to see so<br>it's kind of like putting this you know<br>in this photo here like the the body kit<br>and the the cool wheels and stuff on the<br>Corolla instead of taking it to that<br>next level that's how I kind of think<br>about 10 queer again the macron's<br>popping up here right with the the air<br>and the r there<br>um<br>now on the other hand I have to<br>apologize for this photo I did grow up<br>in I grew up in lower Hutt and now I<br>live in Upper Hutt so you know the car<br>modification scene is a big thing in<br>those places as some of you will know<br>um but if you wanted to move from like<br>just the sort of souped-up Corolla to<br>something that looks like this right<br>something a bit more kind of kind of<br>fancy<br>um and elaborate one of the things that<br>you can start to do is to change the<br>targets of the message of the openings<br>right and with tidel with Maori you<br>actually have a lot of options for doing<br>that and these are some really common<br>ones that you might use in your work<br>showing on this slide right so Koto I<br>think everyone has probably heard of<br>that before and so you could say<br>kyodekoto or tenakoto to address<br>everyone you know if you're sending an<br>email to a big group or something like<br>that<br>um if you're just sending an email to<br>two people you can say like 10 cordua<br>Kyoto cordua right just to indicate that<br>it's to the pair of people if you're<br>sending an email to a friend<br>you know<br>um and that sort of was something we<br>would use when we we know that we have a<br>sort of closer relationship with the<br>person<br>um if you're sending an email to the<br>um to address it to that team and<br>another one too if you're sending an<br>email just to like a group of colleagues<br>that you that you work with this would<br>probably be interchangeable with<br>something like Koto but you could say<br>putting the ma on the end to be honest<br>this is just something I've always heard<br>and always used I don't again know what<br>the technical explanation for it is but<br>to me it's kind of something that um<br>that informalizes it a little bit if<br>that makes sense right so it makes it a<br>little less formal and makes it feel a<br>little bit more intimate I suppose<br>that's always how I've thought about it<br>and I don't know what again what the<br>technical way of putting it is but you<br>can put Ma at the end of it even with<br>ehua you could say um<br>or something like that right just to<br>sort of informalize it a little bit<br>um so yeah that's a way you can kind of<br>you using changing those targets at the<br>end there is a way that you can kind of<br>take that Corolla you know to a whole<br>nother level if you want to by starting<br>to get specific about who you're<br>addressing the message to I suppose<br>right<br>um so hopefully that's useful and again<br>this is a really easy one that you can<br>start practicing with your emails now<br>because all of us or most of us if we're<br>working in jobs where that involves<br>email right we're having to send these<br>things all the time so a helpful way to<br>start practicing using these phrases<br>um<br>and then see how we're going for time<br>perfect the last category again a big<br>work is obviously awesome but having a<br>bit of downtime and break times is<br>really awesome as well right and that is<br>another context probably you know in<br>work where we're doing a lot of that<br>more using a lot of that more informal<br>language to talk with our friends to<br>talk with our colleagues just about how<br>life is going generally right so we have<br>here<br>which is pretty good actually I would<br>say wa means like time or times if we<br>put that in the start saying means times<br>um and whakata is to relax or to take a<br>break right so times for uh relaxing I<br>suppose<br>so what are some of the phrases we could<br>use here well a really common one I was<br>thinking about the sort of chat I have<br>with with colleagues here at the<br>University<br>and a common question will find<br>ourselves find ourselves asking one<br>another as different variants of this<br>one here right are you something at the<br>moment so like a really common question<br>that lecturers ask each other at break<br>times is are you teaching at the moment<br>because we all have different teaching<br>schedules not everyone is teaching and<br>every trimester and that kind of thing<br>so<br>um I imagine too like in your workplace<br>you might want to ask people those sort<br>of questions right about what they're up<br>to or what they're doing or if they're<br>doing something still you know<br>um so where you how you would do that is<br>to basically just use this structure and<br>fill in the blank<br>righte blank<br>queer<br>and so the great thing about this is if<br>you have that structure in your head all<br>you've got to do is it's literally fill<br>in the blank right and one thing I'd say<br>about that too is like<br>this happens to me often as well I will<br>know the English word for what I'm I'm<br>asking or what I want to try and say but<br>I won't necessarily know the mighty word<br>right that happens to me even as someone<br>who's been speaking Maori since I was I<br>don't know two years old or whatever<br>there are still words that come about<br>where I don't know them so what I do<br>often I just throw in the English word<br>right even if I'm speaking to a Maori<br>speaker and you know what's really great<br>about doing that is often if you throw<br>an English word it's sort of an implicit<br>signal to them I don't really know what<br>the word is for that if they know the<br>word they will often tell you right so<br>they will in their response to you they<br>will use the Maori word for it and<br>you'll be like Ah that's the word it's a<br>really it's throwing in English words if<br>you don't know the Maori one is a really<br>good way to learn them because you kind<br>of like crowdsource it right and you put<br>it out there you kind of indicate the<br>person I don't know the word but if you<br>do feel free to use it and that way you<br>can pick them up in everyday<br>conversation<br>so yeah if you if you want to try that<br>out with Maori speakers that's something<br>that you can do you know and again me<br>myself I do that all the time it's just<br>a matter of sort of like giving over<br>that whakama that embarrassment of being<br>like no I don't know the word it's fine<br>there's plenty of words that people<br>don't know just throw in the English one<br>and the the person will let you know if<br>they know what the word is right and if<br>they don't know what the word is then at<br>least use the English one so that you're<br>both on the same page and they<br>understand that's my kind of view<br>um on things<br>another one that you might want to use<br>in break times is often we're sharing<br>stories about bad things that have<br>happened right so someone will be<br>telling you about some you know maybe<br>their kid is sick or they've had some<br>accident or something's not quite going<br>right and so often we respond with in<br>English like you know oh no that's not<br>very good that kind of sucks and the the<br>Maori way that we would express the same<br>sentiment is just saying oh where right<br>oh where not good that's bad oh no right<br>um so yeah fun word to say use that all<br>the time use that use that word a lot<br>with my kids my little kids<br>um they love saying it it's really easy<br>to say in a really easy one that you can<br>you can throw in there oh where for oh<br>no<br>um<br>and then I think the last one is the<br>opposite right so obviously there's<br>there's the bad stuff people will be<br>telling you their stories of bad things<br>that have that have happened and you<br>kind of want to sympathize or empathize<br>but then also often they'll be telling<br>you about really great stuff that's been<br>happening in their life right and you<br>want to say that's awesome now um<br>interior just as there is in English<br>there are lots of different ways that<br>you can convey that same basic idea and<br>I've shown what I think are four of the<br>most common ones here<br>right so there's there's plenty of<br>options if you want to express that<br>sentiment of saying something's really<br>good or amazing or you can use any of<br>these phrases would be<br>um a perfect candidate and I know each<br>of these will have its own like if<br>you're thinking about it linguistically<br>a sort of its own unique etymology then<br>and means something slightly different<br>right which I'll leave that one to the<br>sort of linguists to decipher but for me<br>I just sort of think of them as all<br>interchangeable phrases and you can use<br>the one that you kind of like best or<br>that you're kind of feeling in a<br>particular moment you know that you want<br>to use so all of them serve that purpose<br>of expressing that's awesome I'll just<br>go through those again so you can hear<br>how they said karawi<br>poke<br>me Haro<br>kamo Tui<br>yeah<br>and uh that's pretty much it so those<br>are just some simple phrases you can<br>kind of put into your kitty and start<br>using hopefully around the workplace<br>even today you know if you're at work if<br>you're not I hope you're having a nice<br>um a nice day off but yeah that brings<br>us to the end so that we're there means<br>furnished and what I'll do now is check<br>out the the Q a to see what<br>uh we've had come through we're doing<br>pretty good for time<br>will you share these slides I think I'm<br>not too sure if we will be but I'll<br>leave that with our organizer to figure<br>out if I imagine they collected email<br>addresses as part of this so I'm<br>assuming it wouldn't be hard to do that<br>but I'm very happy to share them<br>um if we can get them to everyone who<br>was here today<br>um<br>is tinakui more formal than Kyoto I<br>usually use it when I'm emailing someone<br>that I've met before but maybe I'm wrong<br>yeah I would agree with that there is an<br>element of a little touch more formality<br>to tianakwe you know<br>um but it's still totally possible to<br>use it informally too I use it with my<br>my kids all the time you know when I see<br>them at the end of the day coming home<br>from work or whatever but yeah it does I<br>think you're right it does have a touch<br>more formality to it tiernakwe relative<br>to Kyoto<br>um<br>and casting<br>Tina create the same question signal<br>more for me formal email yeah again I<br>think it's a touch more formal but it's<br>not like a massive golf right it's not a<br>massive difference so I think you can<br>still use them but yeah tinakwood does<br>have that little element of formality to<br>them so it's good if you're emailing<br>someone you know like we heard in the<br>last question that you haven't met<br>before maybe someone more senior than<br>you or someone where you're asking<br>something from them you know it can be<br>really helpful<br>um Alex<br>uh this is this is good thank you really<br>good to hear winners and macron put over<br>the a in uh taku or taku Alex that is a<br>whole nother that's a rabbit hole in<br>itself because in Maori there's there's<br>all these different words you can use<br>for the I think they call it the uh I<br>put that question up on the screen for<br>the possessor right so there's taku toku<br>taku<br>um there's lots of options I probably<br>can't answer that one here but if you<br>Google that it gives there's lots of<br>advice about when and where to use it to<br>be honest even me I still get confused<br>about when do I say taku when do I say<br>toku but the good thing about taku with<br>no macron is it's the more informal<br>version and you can basically use it for<br>anything so taku is like this the the<br>Swiss army knife of possessives and that<br>you can kind of use it in relation in<br>relation to any noun and it's fine it's<br>so the difference is the fast it's a<br>fast version right taku versus taku or<br>toku right<br>um that that's the difference so I use<br>taku all the time because then I don't<br>have to worry about it it's my sort of<br>cheat<br>um<br>what else Anna uh<br>I'll just put that up for everyone<br>sharing the webpage I use which has some<br>common little phrases oh cool yeah I<br>didn't know we had that on the website<br>that's awesome<br>um<br>maybe we can we can get that put in the<br>chat so people can copy it down<br>um<br>Isabel can you give us examples of kts<br>something query 10A yep so I would say<br>like to my colleagues one thing I would<br>say is<br>um<br>are you teaching at the moment that<br>example I used right or another one you<br>could say like what is what is something<br>you'd want to say in English to a work<br>colleague are you<br>um<br>oh are you are you working at the moment<br>I don't know that's a bit of a dumb<br>example but if you wanted to say that<br>um<br>yeah if you wanted to say uh that would<br>change a little bit if you want to say<br>are you busy at the moment<br>um<br>yeah I don't want to confuse people too<br>much but hopefully that gives some good<br>examples<br>um<br>Natalie good to see that you good to see<br>you like the car analogy yeah that's<br>always a favorite of mine too<br>um<br>yeah good to see<br>ah the keyboard option Robin<br>um<br>for for macrons it's different for<br>different operating systems I think on<br>the on Mac you like hold down the vowel<br>button and it gives you the options and<br>it's kind of clunky but you know what I<br>saw<br>um that this week PB Tech which is like<br>the electronic online electronics store<br>uh they're launching a keyboard<br>specifically for tinomari so that you<br>don't have to do all of that convoluted<br>you know press the thing and the other<br>thing to get the Mac on<br>um so I definitely plan to get one of<br>those because it it does drive me nuts<br>having to do all of that that trickery<br>with the keyboards just to get a Mac on<br>every time I want to use one and often<br>that what that's meant is I just<br>sometimes skip using the maccon with<br>informal emails and stuff because it's<br>just too much time to do it um but yeah<br>that there is a dedicated keyboard<br>coming out for this week I have no no<br>commercial interest in PB Tech or<br>anything I just saw that in an email<br>um so yeah interesting interesting to<br>see I think it'll be really helpful<br>um<br>what else I'm sorry I'm just looking<br>through and thanks everyone too for like<br>the kind words as well<br>um<br>um this is this one is<br>good from uh mighty are there different<br>ways to say over to you in a zoom<br>meeting I always say<br>um<br>what if you said KR queer that would be<br>that would be your choice so that<br>wouldn't quite work<br>um<br>you could say uh yeah how would you say<br>over to you<br>I know it's a tricky one I might think<br>about it Mighty and come back to that<br>if something comes to me in the next<br>four minutes that we have on here but<br>it's a good question over to you<br>uh<br>there'll be a phrase that's just not<br>um<br>so Amber if you wanted to say are you<br>free at the moment you could say<br>um<br>well Christians are moving<br>sorry just trying to keep up<br>um<br>I think I got through all the questions<br>uh Daniel yeah that one I mentioned I<br>think I answered that how would you ask<br>are you busy at the moment<br>um<br>means means busy right<br>um we could just say<br>oh no not Hey Google<br>that would be how I'd say that<br>um<br>um and then Elizabeth indicating that Ma<br>might be for for plural as opposed to<br>informality could be right yeah that<br>could be right and that could be could<br>be off with that it's one of these ones<br>yeah it's like there's bits of language<br>the same with English you know there's<br>things you hear a lot and you're always<br>kind of like I know we all use that but<br>what's the function you know this is<br>kind of one of those like yeah those<br>things I've seen and occasionally throw<br>out there without like the super<br>conscious awareness of the the<br>technicalities but yeah Elizabeth you<br>could be spot on with that one<br>um<br>casting well edgy ways to close an email<br>thinking yeah there's a few options<br>there so instead of the openings what<br>about the closings uh what's one that I<br>use I say akumihi a lot these days my my<br>best wishes you can sing<br>I use it if someone has emailed me<br>saying that they are sick or unwell or<br>something bad has happened to them it's<br>um what's another one that I use a bit I<br>mean gamma he is like the you know if<br>kilda's the Corolla of hello of of<br>openings gum he's the Corolla of<br>closings<br>that's kind of one I use if I it means<br>like you know stay well it's usually<br>when I use to me it's the English<br>equivalent would be all the best so it's<br>like if I'm not going to really talk to<br>that person for a while I'd say no<br>automator<br>um you know sometimes with informal<br>emails I just say na bin which means<br>from bin basically so if I'm just<br>emailing someone I know really well and<br>I can't be bother writing out and got me<br>whatever I just say not being with now<br>with the macron in a with the man crime<br>yeah<br>um<br>cool all right well kyota tato I think<br>that's probably enough for today I have<br>another Hui to head off to uh in a<br>second but yeah really great to to have<br>so many of you here<br>um and to be able to share some of this<br>this video with you hopefully it's<br>useful and yeah all the best for the<br>rest of tariki or Teddy Al Maori<br>um</p></main><footer
