name's awanui um<br>um I am a senior lecturer at takawa Maui<br>and I'll be talking about the importance<br>of understanding history when we are<br>trying to work through our<br>yep sorry I was just checking the chat<br>there<br>okay so as I talk feel free to um Chuck<br>some questions in the chat and um once<br>yeah once we close up I'll I'll have a<br>go at trying to answer some of those<br>questions but if something's you know<br>the top of mind<br>um yeah feel free not to have to wait<br>till the end<br>um yeah so I mean just this is just a<br>little bit of context<br>um so these are our most recent<br>um health of the language sort of<br>results that we've got or stats New<br>Zealand results<br>and what we can see is that you know<br>these ones are sort of measuring lower<br>levels of proficiency so these are the<br>people who can speak more than a few<br>words or phrases into the almadi and so<br>yeah I suppose you know that that's a<br>positive thing<br>um in some respects so we've got younger<br>people being able to see a few more<br>words and a few more phrases until Maori<br>um whether that's sort of a a strong<br>indication of where we're at in terms of<br>the language so what we need for today<br>almadi to be a functional language of of<br>this country<br>um is for us to be able to use Tere Al<br>Maori across a range of contexts to<br>explain our everyday<br>um our everyday lives right so<br>um you know while it's cool that we can<br>all say a little bit here and there<br>um you know we need to be sort of<br>striving for Higher Goals higher<br>aspirations<br>and so when we think about sort of some<br>older stats that we've got so these are<br>the 2013 stats<br>and we can sort of see what's happening<br>in this group so the Maori population is<br>the light blue line and you know we're<br>10 years on now so<br>um what that might look like is quite<br>different from 10 years ago but<br>um we can see obviously the age around<br>55 plus is where we see sort of the<br>greatest dip and decline so<br>um if we think about what was happening<br>sort of 55 to 60 years ago and well 65<br>to 70 years ago now since these results<br>are a little bit older<br>um you know we can start to see our<br>migration patterns the opportunities<br>that were you know the Investments That<br>government were making<br>um and really the shift from<br>um you know communities and every being<br>able to be self-sustainable<br>um in our regions right so there was a<br>massive shift into<br>gaining employment for survival and<br>health and well-being and that kind of<br>thing and that really had an impact on<br>the<br>the normal use of Maori that we saw<br>within our community so<br>um yeah so so if we think of this group<br>of people here<br>um you know they weren't sort of going<br>to night classes they weren't<br>um these were all people who had learned<br>Titi o' Maori as their first language<br>incidental Maori language use was very<br>common<br>within this group of people so what<br>we're trying to deal with at this low I<br>don't know if you can see my little<br>arrow that I'm trying to move around you<br>might not be so anyway I'm moving the<br>arrow around<br>um so what you can see from the zero to<br>sort of 50 age group is that there was a<br>massive stem in that sort of<br>um that decline so from the 85 Plus we<br>see almost that proportion of speakers<br>halved<br>um you know and then we think about some<br>of the reasons why that that decline was<br>stemmed and those were all that steaming<br>was was came through<br>um movements Grass Roots movements<br>um that were mildly LED so Maori took a<br>charge in ensuring that um that decline<br>didn't eventuate to to you know<br>continually halving across our<br>population so these are some steps from<br>the Manuel Maori study so you can find<br>and they're on the matawai website free<br>download and so these steps we asked of<br>um over a thousand respondents<br>um at you know at ti matatini so you can<br>think about the context of who might be<br>at those types of events or a cultural<br>event where Ted El Maori was obviously<br>valued and So within our participant<br>group we have you know we've broken up<br>we're tyrion's heard and so for our<br>participants the Mirai continues to be a<br>space where terial Maori is is used and<br>heard and you know even with whether<br>somebody was<br>um had high proficiency or low<br>proficiency these stats kind of mirror<br>each other so you know relatives Hui<br>whanau so all of these social<br>engagements<br>um tend to be the places where we hear<br>our language being used this was<br>slightly different I haven't got the the<br>slide for it but um yeah I'll talk about<br>the the result from our non-maori where<br>obviously a workplace but I was you know<br>not obviously a high area for non-maori<br>but work was definitely somewhere where<br>they saw today being used so if we think<br>about you know going back to the<br>historical context<br>um<br>when we had the signing of the treaty we<br>had we were we were still the majority<br>population<br>um Maori was used across our economic<br>systems our social systems our<br>governance systems our you know our<br>religious activities so all of these<br>systems were<br>um were dominated by Teddy Al Maori so<br>um so you know<br>uh non-maori in order to engage in these<br>systems they needed to get on board with<br>tidal Maori<br>um and so you know as part of the the<br>context of colonialism<br>um and this is you know by the time that<br>um you know the the settlers arrived in<br>New Zealand with kind of um colonizing<br>um aspirations<br>um you know the the techniques that had<br>been sort of honed and used<br>um in other in other<br>um colonized Nations<br>um you know they'd kind of got it down<br>to a fine art so they understood that in<br>order to gain economic power in order to<br>gain governance control<br>um in in control of our social<br>structures tidal Maori was a real key to<br>unlocking um you know sort of dominance<br>over the mind and so this is something<br>that um<br>a Kenyan author talks about in his book<br>decolonizing The Mind as well<br>so I mean<br>I might get us to have a look at<br>um at this YouTube<br>clip<br>um actually I'll just see how much time<br>we've got<br>um but anyway you can sort of see at a<br>glance right so land<br>um position Maori Lane Holdings<br>um This Is Us in 1860 This Is Us in 1939<br>and you can imagine what today looks<br>like so what happens when we're no<br>longer able to<br>um access our tribal lands obviously<br>there's<br>um the the lack of connection that or<br>access that we have to our lands<br>um but we also<br>um we also<br>were unable to sort of do things like<br>grow our own food into to the scale that<br>we were doing and we were unable to you<br>know when when<br>um you know when we think about<br>um<br>all the ways that land had been<br>um<br>how Maori had been depossessed of our<br>ability to be self-sustaining and<br>spiritually related to lean loss so when<br>we think about the attributions for<br>decline for language decline one of the<br>issues that I kind of see sometimes is<br>um we we sort of we don't really have a<br>strong connection between this idea that<br>land is directly real you know land loss<br>is directly related to<br>um language loss and so this is you know<br>a recent<br>um report from the Royal Society on<br>languages in New Zealand<br>um so the attributions made for language<br>loss and artillery we see<br>um diminishing numbers of younger<br>speakers yep<br>um<br>we also see public context education<br>system but you know people were a little<br>bit they kind of need to go one one step<br>back and actually say well actually this<br>is related to<br>um land disposition<br>so you know obviously those um so we had<br>the<br>um you know I'll just read this quite<br>actually so Vincent O'Malley<br>um one of our key historians who talks<br>about the idea that you get the native<br>land Court established in 1865 and two<br>years later you get the native land<br>School System One strips Maori of their<br>land and and the other their language<br>and we still hear the consequences of<br>that today in many ways so um you know<br>these things are very much going hand in<br>hand<br>um these processes when we think about<br>what<br>um you know what these native schools<br>um had in mind for our people<br>remembering that we gifted these lands<br>to<br>um to you know to to enable this<br>education system to take place and they<br>were very much places of assimilation<br>um and so you know the person I was just<br>talking about in Google<br>he describes this idea that the physical<br>violence of the battlefield was followed<br>by the psychological violence of the<br>classroom but where the former was<br>visibly brutal the latter was visibly<br>gentle and so you know when we don't<br>have scars when we don't have<br>um physical uh representations of that<br>Mum eye sometimes it can be really<br>difficult to pinpoint<br>um how that how that looks and you know<br>how that manifests<br>so um you know we still have uh<br>leftovers you know we still have racism<br>um we still have a preference for<br>monolingualism<br>um in New Zealand and we've seen that<br>you know this is last year's take on<br>um uh the medic Academy all the<br>different<br>um<br>yeah the ways that people responded to<br>um to that so some were positive so some<br>some people<br>um wanted to demonstrate their dis you<br>know the um their dislike or they're<br>disdained um towards racism and so you<br>know we actually saw<br>um the media kakrimi chocolate bars<br>being sold out so that actually worked<br>in the favor<br>so going back<br>um to this historical trauma and<br>decolonization so this is Kitty Lawson<br>she talks about um she's done a PhD on<br>historical trauma and all the all the<br>different ways that it impacts on our<br>health and well-being<br>um and so she talks about this idea that<br>with each generation the source of<br>wounding becomes more difficult to see<br>in name creating a necessity for<br>decolonization the sequel to reclaiming<br>and using historical narratives for<br>healing is using them to further<br>self-determination the pathway it means<br>by which positive reconstructions<br>perceive or follow deconstructions of<br>trauma histories is known except to<br>those who are willing and courageous<br>enough to to look for them so you know<br>um Kitty has a a wealth of knowledge in<br>this area one of her mentors is a guy<br>called Eduardo Duran and in his book so<br>he's a Native American Scholar who's<br>done you know a lot of work counseling<br>and Native reservations and states and<br>one of the activities that he asks is um<br>his clients to think about is<br>um<br>uh you know he gets them to to draw a<br>um a up a sort of tree from from<br>the client and then he asked those<br>people to<br>um to gift a set of trauma to each of<br>their URI so so the idea behind that<br>kind of<br>um<br>that exercises that if we're able to<br>work through our trauma in this lifetime<br>we're able to not only heal the future<br>Generations but also the past<br>Generations<br>so I mean this impacts on tidal Maori<br>use in a number of ways so historical<br>trauma<br>um it also impacts on the attributions<br>for language achievement so achievement<br>in terms of both success and successes<br>and failures so if we think about you<br>know the reasons that we give ourselves<br>for when we might be doing well or not<br>so well at an activity like language<br>learning then this can yeah this some<br>attributions may be empowering While<br>others can put us into a state of you<br>know not actually feeling that great<br>about our decision so<br>um you know the failures or you know<br>language failures those are like the<br>errors that everybody every single<br>second language learner makes<br>um so if you're a second language<br>learner you know uh you're bound to make<br>just normal errors<br>um and so when we make those errors if<br>we attribute those errors to being<br>um based on the fact that you know where<br>we're culturally sort of insufficient in<br>a way and so there's a whole another<br>discourse which you know we're not going<br>to get through in the next five minutes<br>um but you know if we're starting to<br>make attributions about why we're not<br>able to to achieve the language goals<br>that we want to<br>um in ways that are actually unhelpful<br>to ourselves then this can actually have<br>a negative impact on how long we sustain<br>the behavior of language learning so if<br>I assume that I'm I'm not good at<br>language learning because<br>um you know what does that say about my<br>identity as Maori so there's a lot of<br>discourses around the connection between<br>identity and language but if I have had<br>no training of Titi o' Maori is the<br>first second language that I've ever<br>learned<br>um then you know that's going to impact<br>on me in different ways as well so I'm<br>you know I might not have some um just<br>normal strategies for learning a second<br>language because it's the first time<br>that I've ever had to do that activity<br>so I weighing up the cost of an error so<br>if we as<br>um if we think that terial Maori<br>um allows us to have an in-group<br>belonging sense of belonging when that I<br>you know if we're not sort of feeling<br>like we're we're succeeding in our<br>language<br>um<br>our language Journey then that also<br>means that that identity can sometimes<br>feel Out Of Reach for for a lot of our<br>people<br>so what's important to me as an educator<br>um you know at this institution<br>um to think about some of the tools that<br>we can use to equip Learners with um you<br>know the best opportunities that they<br>can do you know that they can have to<br>learn to deal Maori so obviously having<br>high expectations that are guided with<br>aroha is really important for us<br>um having organized teaching having<br>wahiru makiril so that's that's<br>something that's really important so<br>having spaces where Ted El Maori is the<br>only acceptable language for that time<br>period for that location<br>um also having you know positive<br>relationships both with peers and<br>um mentors and uh and kayako and that<br>kind of thing and then obviously helping<br>to transition outside of the classroom<br>into natural environments of use and<br>that obviously comes back to<br>um the support that's needed from you<br>know more of the you know government<br>support<br>um yeah to ensure that those<br>environments are available so um<br>understanding the historical contract uh<br>context if we understand if our Toyota<br>understand that colonialism created the<br>conditions by which you know Teri Al<br>Maori was devalued<br>um we we lost the ability to you know be<br>self-governing all of these things it<br>can take away<br>um the individual feelings of you know<br>I'm just not a good language learner<br>well actually you know there were<br>generations of you know there are a lot<br>of things that um took place in order<br>for you to to have to be in a position<br>where you're reclaiming your language<br>and<br>um paying for that as well<br>so<br>um yeah so some of the education related<br>factors obviously continue<br>um so you know providing these positive<br>feelings of empowerment you know agency<br>over their learning<br>um and also you know the connection that<br>we have as Learners with our wider<br>um and other other institutions that<br>have been<br>um you know going for over 44 years so<br>in 44 years<br>um you know which followed that<br>um so you know at the moment we're<br>seeing a really positive shift in<br>attitudes from the general population<br>um towards city almadi which is really<br>good for the language so that that um<br>that creates further um demand for for<br>Maori across different spheres it also<br>improves the ability for some Maori to<br>have workplaces where terial Maori is<br>used<br>um we can we can see it more<br>um in our communities<br>upheld by those who have power who have<br>resources to spend money on something<br>that they think is worthwhile<br>um you know so<br>so we also see a shift in messaging so<br>some of our messaging<br>um that we we heard coming through our<br>research participants was that you know<br>in order to be a good citizen of<br>aotearoa I needed to learn tidal Maori<br>um so you know these are positive shifts<br>um and but they have also created an uh<br>you know unprecedented uptake of of<br>Maori language which which creates<br>another set of Dynamics so that's you<br>know about<br>um classroom relationship management<br>um understanding you know both parties<br>understanding where each other is at<br>demonstration of monarchitunga in those<br>spaces is really important and that was<br>a call from a lot of our research<br>Maori language spaces for them to are to<br>hide it so this is a you know the<br>concept of<br>um you know treating lightly this is a<br>this is still<br>um a place where identities are being<br>explored historical violence is being<br>explored so um so there's a lot going on<br>for tonight when they are entering into<br>these spaces um and so you know that the<br>the context of having both<br>um both parties coming into this<br>Collective space<br>um requires nurturing and negotiation<br>so um yeah and obviously it's political<br>like we can't assume that Maori<br>acquisition processes are not political<br>um and so you know this this is positive<br>to see these steps um so you know this<br>is even you know within a short time<br>frame from 2016 we see this shift coming<br>and you know more people were<br>um thinking that it would be a good<br>thing a full Maori sport uh you know I<br>spoke to Dale um it would be a good<br>thing if um you know<br>um tidio Maori was a core subject so<br>that's the the one on the left there<br>so um you know from these were some just<br>a couple of steps from the manawatu<br>report<br>um that actually yeah sorry<br>from the manual study that aren't in<br>that report that they are here in front<br>of you so the the um the label down the<br>bottom there so the yes no so the yes is<br>um they they had high proficiency and no<br>it was no no they didn't have high<br>proficiency and titil so what you can<br>see is that on the left here<br>um those that have<br>um<br>Maori it can you know can speak to real<br>Maori they were less likely to<br>experience discrimination in their<br>workplace<br>um but obviously you can imagine the<br>types of you know workplaces that those<br>people are engaged in so obviously if<br>you're working at a kurukova or if<br>you're working at Oklahoma or you're not<br>going to be discriminated against or<br>using tibial Maori aims and then on the<br>other side so those that didn't have to<br>deal Mario weren't confident and to Del<br>Maori<br>um they yeah they tended to you know<br>have kind of higher rates of<br>discrimination experiences<br>so you know whether whether Terio Maori<br>is an essential part of somebody's job<br>means um that that's you know when we<br>think about how we break down the time<br>that we spend in our day if you're<br>spending eight hours in a workplace<br>where tidal Maori is used it's eight<br>hours of of contact that's eight eight<br>hours of being able to use your language<br>um and that's important for you know<br>there's a lot of people who<br>um yeah<br>who who sorry I've just seen the time<br>I'm just going to move on okay anyway so<br>yeah it's great if we do have<br>um more<br>spaces where we can use Ted El Maori<br>including in workplaces understanding<br>the historical context is also really<br>important for understanding how we how<br>we respond to our own learning<br>experiences so I'm just going to stop<br>there and see if anybody has any<br>questions<br>oh yeah I'll put the clip and<br>sorry that was just the<br>question to put the clip<br>okay<br>yeah so I mean Charlotte's just asked a<br>question<br>um<br>so the question was do you see<br>oh can you see that question can other<br>sorry I actually can't see that question<br>now<br>um so the question was<br>um<br>do I see like a commodification of TDL<br>being used<br>um and if yeah if you you can sort of<br>read my response to that in<br>um<br>so I do talk about<br>um<br>some instances where you know that<br>commodification is happening and so<br>that's why I raise the that last slide<br>um that I actually didn't speak to but<br>the idea that you know if if your<br>workplace is benefiting financially from<br>teddial Maori and what are you doing to<br>ensure that your Maori staff have access<br>to improving<br>um their exposure to to Leon Maori their<br>their Reclamation of titil Maori<br>um yeah so that's kind of my response to<br>that<br>Kiora<br>um<br>so Andrea<br>um<br>how can we manage to do a more reasoning<br>workplaces while we are still learning<br>and not floating oh so there's I mean<br>great part-time Andrea so there's lots<br>of things that you can do so obviously<br>um so non-maori staff and and<br>organizations what you can do is<br>advocate for your Maori staff being able<br>to have opportunities to learn tiril<br>Maori first and foremost and then if<br>there are you know additional resources<br>that are being made available<br>um seeking out to have opportunities<br>where to Del Maori is<br>um you know perhaps taught collectively<br>you can also<br>encourage you know use of terial Maori<br>um within your workplace by<br>um you know demonstrating that you're a<br>person that's interested in city almari<br>or you know<br>um you can also be clear about your your<br>interests so you can you know you can<br>have those direct conversations with<br>people that<br>um that indicate that you um would like<br>to<br>um<br>yeah be somebody that's a safe person to<br>um to have to deal Maori being spoken<br>um yeah so okay so kyota Andrea uh Kitty<br>um<br>foreign<br>yeah I mean I think I mean every<br>election is going to be<br>um<br>yeah yeah I am concerned about some of<br>the um<br>some of the trends that may happen<br>um should you know should somebody get<br>into power over somebody else<br>um but I suppose the main messages that<br>you know cortato Derby Maldives<br>you know we we have faced<br>um we've faced bigger issues than um the<br>potential of a<br>um of a government you know a more<br>recent government that's going to be<br>unsupportive of today Maori so<br>um all of us who are you know supportive<br>of of Tyrion Maori will continue to be<br>doing so<br>um so what we need from our allies from<br>you know our parka is to say you know<br>call out racism when you see it make<br>sure that you have a voice and<br>advocating Against Racism particularly<br>that that hasn't all racism has an<br>impact on city of Maori so that's my<br>biggest<br>um yeah my biggest uh encouragement for<br>um<br>so yeah<br>um<br>yeah so I mean the protection of our<br>waiter when we're also encouraging um<br>some attitude this is a really important<br>discussion and I think it's<br>um yeah particularly for<br>um kayako so you know we have a pretty<br>decent job at creating those those<br>ground rules so coming into a um a Maori<br>language classroom<br>um you know day one those those<br>understandings need to be sort of laid<br>out um you know that that the protection<br>of our Maori students is really vital<br>um within this revitalization process so<br>um part of that is also about you know<br>making sure that we have kind of a<br>greater set of<br>um understanding about these historical<br>issues before<br>um<br>um sort of engage in these very um kind<br>of uh personal<br>sort of spaces so you know when we have<br>that dual kind of like motivation for<br>learning to deal Maori so a lot of<br>tangata finra are looking for<br>Reclamation we're wanting to reconnect<br>to our people we're wanting to reconnect<br>to our federal and that can be really<br>um a different set of goals than if<br>you're wanting to demonstrate<br>citizenship right so<br>um so I mean I think what I yeah my main<br>encouragement is to think about is<br>tangaturity<br>to think about you know the ways in<br>which<br>um you are coming into this space you<br>know being cognizant of what it means to<br>be a good manuhiti<br>um In This Very sort of<br>um treacherous water so cool yeah but<br>obviously yeah there's there's some<br>other corridoro that um that I can have<br>about that um you know so I offer the<br>this idea of the six T's Tatiana so if<br>you're coming into a Adele Maori space<br>um making sure that you know you are toe<br>within yourself so so making sure that<br>your breathing is aligned that you're in<br>contact with your teenager that you have<br>some connection with your tile that you<br>have your taitsuada so having support<br>people<br>um with you through that Journey<br>um and<br>um geez I forget the other two so I have<br>thank you<br>um so Roxanne Gilda um<br>can you<br>tell us the name of of the book you<br>reference about decolonizing<br>okay so decolonizing the mind the<br>politics of of language and African<br>literature<br>um<br>oh Kilda<br>there's about six hours oh well<br>yes killed everyone really really<br>appreciate that call it all in that<br>context<br>um and I suppose you know um what<br>Leanne's saying here is<br>um you know that really hits home that<br>actually works when I may want to cry<br>but I'm not going to do that in front of<br>you know a live audience but<br>um but yeah I think you know for for all<br>of us as indigenous peoples who are<br>um who are seeking ways to improve you<br>know<br>to maintain what our what our um our<br>ancestors gave to us<br>gave to us so yeah I really appreciate<br>so Natalie<br>thank you<br>um<br>decolonizing or indigenizing why do you<br>have a preference do you have a<br>preference in why so I mean these things<br>sort of I mean one of the challenges<br>with decolonizing is obviously the idea<br>that we sent to the colonizer in that<br>experience but with anti-racism you know<br>that colonizer needs to needs to<br>acknowledge that process of colonization<br>in a Maori space we are thinking about<br>indigenizing so you know this is a space<br>where you know we are hoping that<br>um that those decolonizing for card or<br>are happening within our treaty partners<br>and so obviously within ourselves we are<br>looking at re-indigenizing so we're<br>looking at ways of<br>reintroducing our own practices for<br>ourselves so<br>um Thank you Pam Kilda<br>um<br>so Catherine doesn't have a<br>uh dedicated workplace or
