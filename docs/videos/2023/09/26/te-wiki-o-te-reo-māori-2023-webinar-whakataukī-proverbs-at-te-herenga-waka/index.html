following our normal<br>um<br>this particular character is sort of<br>talks about those different birds in the<br>forest and it speaks about diversity in<br>our vet diversity makes<br>our world of richer place and so the<br>diversity of those goods and the<br>diversity of the voices that they have<br>and the contribution they make are all<br>there and so put on but today<br>um we've got together yeah maybe that's<br>a good little uh probably for us uh and<br>then the second oligopi you put the<br>money paid tomatoes<br>all of us sort of pursuing knowledge and<br>so you know just that it's not there<br>with it where uh get together today<br>um<br>that's not necessarily a problem but um<br>just speaks about the thread of the<br>power and<br>is that um<br>for the party there are two guys that<br>there and as we know we might know okay<br>just here there's the tallest tree in<br>the forest<br>um but it's root system is really<br>shallow<br>but the strength it has a shallow root<br>uh system but it interlocks with other<br>cohesive media standing leads to it and<br>uh um so its strength it comes from the<br>interlocking of those roots and um so<br>it's okay<br>um that's a thought anyway for our staff<br>um and then<br>and she's okay<br>but<br>um more translation is important<br>expertise of our ancestors use of the<br>language<br>the English might be a bit clunky but<br>the mildness is really nice and an<br>example of that might be this<br>foreign<br>uh and the ideas that<br>um position<br>in the thought inside of it that you<br>have your choosing business positions<br>but I also have my own treated positions<br>and the idea is that um<br>other people will have their own gifts<br>and skills and abilities but um<br>I have my own and and likewise there's<br>no reason for one to feel like being a<br>uh lesser than somebody else and so all<br>of those ideas about maintaining your<br>own Manner and supporting the manner of<br>others without feeling like you have to<br>dominate one and have to be dominated by<br>someone else<br>and it's all<br>wrapped up in those few groups and I<br>just think that was a little excited<br>needs<br>um<br>this thing um so I hope people can see<br>you can just seeing if we can change the<br>audio<br>okay okay so the technical staff say<br>that will be better so hopefully it is<br>um the<br>um<br>words have power words have meaning<br>uh and um<br>likewise have that and<br>um<br>often promote a system of values and<br>behaviors<br>and those things we might call our<br>tikkana and um there are<br>there are these other quotes uh Moana<br>Jackson and his words Maori are<br>sustained by the essential beliefs and<br>wadua which underpins the culture uh<br>John Dungy hope the life force the aura<br>the Mystique the ethos the lifestyle all<br>this is bound up in the spirituality of<br>of the Maori world<br>and this quote from Eden<br>and talking about weaving and the old<br>people's way you learned and understood<br>the spiritual side when weaving as a<br>part of you when you are weaving your<br>one with yourself in the world and that<br>idea that<br>um<br>their uh these words are sort of uh come<br>from or or emanate out of a system of<br>belief that I think that if you're not<br>clear about<br>um those ideas and and sometimes it's<br>difficult to understand some of these<br>Proverbs because they come from a<br>different place a different theoretical<br>place and so um but they also have real<br>practical meanings uh at the time they<br>were pulled together and so there's a an<br>element of them emanating from our value<br>system but also the Practical part of it<br>in helping us to live in the world that<br>we live in<br>and of course we can't uh forget the<br>um the taranaki prophet Peter attz who<br>um in a statement over a cup of tea the<br>other week said to me ortikana is based<br>on spiritual beliefs and so um<br>likewise<br>if there's if there is no<br>um<br>uh if people don't believe what they're<br>saying if it's just words uh then<br>they're just Hollow and so I think<br>um connecting them with um values that<br>we might hold and behaviors that we<br>think would be appropriate as um as a<br>starting point for whakatoki in my<br>thinking<br>uh along with it<br>um<br>uh and that idea sort of it comes out of<br>uh the Bible actually that<br>um you know the the tongue is the source<br>of life or death uh but it's that same<br>idea of being understanding the context<br>that we're working and living in and<br>then speaking into that context and that<br>can be for for good or for not so good<br>um this is a quote from timoti karetu<br>talking a little bit about<br>um<br>uh that if any good orator<br>must be able to employ Toki where<br>appropriate they encapsulate our<br>thoughts so well there's little need to<br>use more words when these words are so<br>apt and succinct<br>um for the orator's point to be<br>appreciated it's essential for the<br>audience also to know for latoki and so<br>um<br>yeah very good speakers and people who<br>and learn how they fit into particular<br>contexts<br>and again here's a an example of a<br>whakatoki that might be useful or to<br>and so which speaks about<br>um the relationships the importance of<br>relationships<br>um rather than being focused on some of<br>the material things that might bring<br>people together and so the I guess the<br>value being<br>promoted there as um you know take care<br>of the relationships that we have<br>because they'll hold us in good steep<br>um<br>okay<br>uh and then a quote from Patterson<br>um Proverbs are not abstract rules or<br>ethics principles each arises from some<br>concrete situation<br>and it's that situation which determines<br>its meaning in value content at the<br>beginning at the beginning of well you<br>know when it was used because I think<br>Proverbs have the capacity to change and<br>move with the times too but this is a<br>um marry the woman of the flex<br>um<br>not sure<br>um the English sounds a bit clunky in a<br>in the mildy is much more um<br>um<br>descriptive uh to sleep with the woman<br>in the<br>Flex pitch<br>but the idea is uh<br>that<br>um working with traditionally working<br>with flex was physically demanding and<br>so the the person that worked with the<br>flex was likely to be fit likely to be<br>hard working and likely to be persistent<br>in the work that they do<br>um the flex had multiple uses and so<br>um there was weaving and all of the Arts<br>of weaving but they're also all the<br>Practical things like<br>making clothing ropes and mats and<br>tukutuku and home insulation that's<br>those sorts of things so their Flex was<br>a person that could use those everyday<br>things was the hard worker then they're<br>good they're a good choice for uh for a<br>life partner<br>as I was sort of reflecting on it you<br>know the power is also a metaphor that's<br>used for<br>to talk about family and perhaps it's<br>their uh elements that might say that<br>you know<br>marry a woman who<br>um is about her business with the family<br>that works hard in families<br>um so<br>yep uh<br>but Proverbs like myths I've seen it<br>um as providing presidents for proper<br>behavior<br>uh and so<br>um<br>the idea that uh the older sibling might<br>have responsibilities<br>and keep the younger siblings in line<br>there's a role that the tuacana takes<br>but on the other side of it that perhaps<br>there are things where the taina can be<br>teaching the Elder siblings<br>and things like tolerance<br>and the<br>interesting and the Maori stories with<br>mawi being the youngest<br>often his brothers would try to correct<br>and to contain<br>Maui but<br>um<br>Maui as the younger brother was<br>innovative<br>and uh if Maui hadn't sort of gone<br>against<br>uh what was the status quo then uh the<br>generations that followed wouldn't have<br>had uh the benefits<br>that came from the work that he did so<br>uh the the place of tuakana and Tina and<br>trying to work out so what the<br>what's the right<br>approach what's the right timing for<br>these things to be to be talked about so<br>and maybe the parents might use<br>something like that to talk to the Elder<br>siblings to you know to care for their<br>younger siblings<br>whereas the detainer might come back<br>with the other half of the of the<br>whakatoki so<br>um often these are setting presidents<br>but the president's uh<br>um<br>uh determined by the context in which<br>they used<br>marry a person with calisthenians is a<br>a hard-working person<br>but often these uh whakatoki have<br>um<br>does not last long you know looking at<br>it and you know it uh<br>um it perishes but uh a beautiful face<br>endures for a long time so which one<br>would be the appropriate whakatoki to<br>share with individuals<br>at a particular time is down to the<br>person that might be speaking into the<br>context and<br>so it's just an example of<br>um that sometimes these whakatoki have<br>um so there's a and that sort of leads<br>to this idea that there is balance and<br>Common Sense and the manner of those<br>involved<br>uh led to reasonable<br>um<br>uh lead to reasonable Solutions<br>uh and so these commonly known or a<br>couple of them are very commonly known<br>um<br>the commoners and Chiefs and when<br>working independently complete the tasks<br>but this idea of<br>um<br>those who are leading play a role but<br>those who are uh other Following also<br>play a role but neither can achieve what<br>they want to achieve unless they work<br>together<br>uh which you know in in terms of an<br>organization like<br>is inept sign for um for this place<br>my loose translation you know create<br>create options let you know make sure<br>you have options when playing a fails go<br>to plan B and<br>um you know often see it at times when<br>um<br>uh when when you need options you need<br>options but also you know I've heard it<br>used that as people move around into<br>different places<br>uh and so then people<br>uh occupy one space and they move to<br>another space then they think oh yeah<br>well things have changed and we've just<br>moved into a new space and we've started<br>a new journey and so we forget the<br>things of the past now<br>we leave the things of the past behind<br>um<br>um remember the fault of Runner and if<br>people are aware of<br>uh the story of Rona who went outside<br>and was tripping over the uh uh roots of<br>trees that she um because the moon was<br>covered by clouds that<br>um<br>she cursed the moon and as a result of<br>that the moon grabbed her and and took<br>her away<br>and um and so the but the lesson or the<br>value there or the lesson there is to be<br>careful about cursing the powerful you<br>know don't um<br>don't be flippant about uh you know the<br>hand that feeds you and I guess a whole<br>lot of these Proverbs uh can be aligned<br>with uh Proverbs and other cultures<br>um<br>but these are sort of framed and mildy<br>stories and if you knew the story then<br>you would be aware of what action<br>um<br>and um since it's<br>uh I thought uh there are a couple of<br>well-known sayings and when learning the<br>language and so I thought I'd<br>um just put in a couple<br>uh the first one I don't know if it's um<br>said as a proverb necessarily but it it<br>has some<br>um learning and some direction uh being<br>subdue the Beast again my my translation<br>of apprehension and often heard in real<br>Maori spaces and encouraging people to<br>not to be apprehensive not to be<br>um shy or shamed about making mistakes<br>and those sorts of things<br>um I quite like I don't know who said it<br>but probably uh their idea of no might<br>their hair that is often heard as the<br>other side of it is that we welcome<br>and through my making mistakes we're<br>able to<br>correct and move on<br>the second one there are quite a number<br>of these types of sayings and this one<br>promoting the language and we had um<br>the real moment yesterday and one of the<br>songs that was sung this it was a line<br>uh my language is a treasure position<br>and the last one again is<br>um<br>I'm not sure if I can take any<br>um<br>view all of the comments or questions<br>but at the end we'll have a bit of a<br>summary and and catch up on those<br>um they're hitting our Walker<br>uh I think you know in the vernacular of<br>which is uh the name of the Mirai at the<br>heading awaka this is the name that<br>we've taken on as a part of the<br>University<br>um the place uh<br>but the two movies also Kim referred to<br>an individual who might be the Hitching<br>Post of uh of a project or a family of a<br>community<br>um and then different parts the heading<br>heading that brings people together<br>um that uh<br>uh joins people in relationships and<br>hitting up matauranga as this idea of uh<br>in this place uh where<br>uh<br>uh this has become like a like a a pool<br>of knowledge and so to bring all of<br>those various knowledges uh into the<br>space fits us as a as a as an<br>organization<br>which is the name of Maori studies here<br>and<br>um my understanding is that you know<br>part of the name of uh of this Maori<br>studies was to do with the practices of<br>Maori in Maui like like I mentioned<br>previously was a an innovator an<br>initiator a Explorer<br>um he had all of those sorts of uh<br>characteristics and<br>um those are good characteristics for<br>people in a space again like this who<br>are analyzing and looking at the world<br>that we live in uh thinking about those<br>things thinking about improving the uh<br>the space for our people and all of<br>um which is the name of the uh the<br>building up here<br>um<br>the a builder of canoes and uh one of<br>the<br>uh stories about him was that he didn't<br>go about his work correctly initially<br>and when he uh chopped down a tree uh he<br>he came back the next day to prepare it<br>uh but it had been reinstated by the<br>birds and then the insects around at<br>that time till eventually uh he came to<br>the conclusion that I should have done<br>um and then things will work out<br>appropriately work out well and so<br>the X when you get things right you do<br>it in the right order in the right way<br>then you'll achieve your goals and so<br>um<br>and then this last one is a<br>is I guess a modern proverb that's been<br>promoted<br>with the building of the parmatora<br>and so this has come from discussions<br>so a thriving sustainable community<br>a living lab and my understanding is<br>was that in the same way that the<br>Sciences might have their Labs<br>mildly needed a moldy lab in the way<br>that looked and the way that that was<br>structured is the current<br>this living building will be an addition<br>um it'll be a different type of lab but<br>it's a response<br>by that will lead our whanau into<br>thinking about sustainability and HIPAA<br>mataura<br>the it'll be a<br>um<br>a bright future based on<br>uh the future needs of of of this place<br>in the future needs of our people so<br>there's a whole lot of accorded or<br>inside that too<br>um often uh Proverbs are used in tribal<br>areas and amongst families and I thought<br>I'd throw a couple in from<br>um from my area and so these ones might<br>be a little bit more abstract and not so<br>which was a statement made by one of our<br>Chiefs in response to the government<br>um<br>saying that they would<br>overrun our people and I guess this is<br>our tribal saying for saying uh the same<br>thing as cafo fight<br>that we will<br>fight on together uh<br>and then the second one I like uh was<br>said a few times by um Tom Rohr I heard<br>and the idea of um<br>uh fight the fight and do what you got<br>to do even if it is means we harm each<br>other<br>in order for us to get to a place where<br>we will have peace and<br>um and security<br>uh and so<br>um which was a saying by uh wahanui to<br>King tafial who disagreed with what had<br>happened a particular event<br>and wahanui responders saying well say<br>what you got to say do what you got to<br>do and then we'll sit down and make<br>peace so we can move forward<br>uh the third one is one that comes from<br>my particular uh<br>morai<br>on one occasion the P her father was<br>actually killed in a in a battle and<br>um several years after that the people<br>that had been responsible for his death<br>uh visited the par and para<br>was making Roy which is ground<br>um Fern root but it's quite a hard<br>process to do to to grind it down and to<br>make it into<br>um sort of a bread<br>and but she did that out of following<br>tikana to<br>um to look after her visitors but as she<br>was doing it she turned her back and<br>protested the the death of her father<br>hadn't been Avenged as a result of of<br>this event<br>um land was gifted in uh from from that<br>party to our people and though that's<br>the place where we live at the moment so<br>um these uh of Proverbs about the way<br>that we we might disagree with people<br>um but there are ways to go about to put<br>out our disagreements and um and also<br>ways to<br>um<br>to come back together again<br>I think this is uh well known the idea<br>that um tawago is off is sort of a place<br>of<br>um<br>uh difficulty and uh when things aren't<br>quite going uh all right uh then uh you<br>might say well these are the hard times<br>but it's there's um hope Beyond this<br>time and so um<br>foreign<br>from your own places are the stories<br>that you tell your own people and they<br>have<br>um they have uh connections or<br>usefulness outside of<br>um outside of your own people because<br>often they're principles that we might<br>want to support and promote uh but<br>um and then often who set them and where<br>they were set have meaning for the<br>people that are using them and speaking<br>to them and so<br>um yep and<br>maybe this is my last slide uh is that<br>you know whakatokia for today and um we<br>recently<br>re-built our foreign<br>and um the one of the projects was that<br>uh each of the whanau were asked to do a<br>tukutuku panel and there's the result of<br>that then one of my cousins at the end<br>of seeing all of this work<br>and we were the the tukutuku patterns<br>were about remembering our places our<br>old homesteads and the activities and<br>the people there those people in that<br>past that is gone but then it was being<br>put into a stylized a pattern of today<br>so tukutukutia or the present day and<br>the process of doing that brought our<br>hapu together and so<br>um it was a nice scene so<br>um it's now it's becoming used amongst<br>our MRI anyway so whakatokia for today<br>too the second one was was a bit of a<br>cheeky one<br>um<br>there's a little bit of an insult you<br>know<br>a bit like<br>maybe it should change today to me oh<br>I<br>you know a I<br>um for a person that you know knows a<br>lot of stuff sometimes people know a lot<br>of stuff and it can be uh a nice thing<br>to say but sometimes people don't know a<br>lot of stuff<br>and you can so they cut they can cut<br>both ways depending on the context and<br>this last one was I went to the Hui<br>um last week and one of the guys who's a<br>health and safety guy here at the<br>University<br>he was talking to the construction<br>workers and he referred to the people<br>here as precious peaches like they're a<br>little bit<br>um well you know that sometimes were a<br>little bit uh precious a bit a little<br>bit I don't know soft but it just made<br>that you know a person who's a little<br>bit fragile then might be a nap scene<br>for for them so<br>uh I think that's all we have time for<br>uh and um<br>uh maybe we'll just close in this<br>karakia<br>and uh<br>um<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
