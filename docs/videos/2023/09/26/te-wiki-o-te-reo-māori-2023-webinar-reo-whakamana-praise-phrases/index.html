we<br>have uh participants joining<br>um but we'll use our time together for<br>dinner<br>um so I'm here I work within our faculty<br>of education and so my my co-oper for<br>everyone this morning<br>oh<br>so just gotta oh yeah I just I'll try<br>and manage the chats<br>um but we also have Alan helping as well<br>all right I'll just carry on then<br>um<br>so kobapa for today for our first<br>session uh for tabithia almari with our<br>time here at Tahira nawaka is looking at<br>different types of of mehi or<br>acknowledgments<br>well<br>so what I wanted to look at first a<br>common practice and uh for many of us<br>when we're attending either Hui or<br>different types of gathering often uh in<br>um Maori environments or even Beyond<br>Maori environments<br>um we begin with a karakia so this is an<br>example on how we could acknowledge the<br>person who has<br>Umi or our Gatherings together through<br>a couple of things that I want to note<br>here<br>is the kupu or the term Kai karakia and<br>so uh with well a lot of us have an<br>understanding that term clay means<br>different things um common as food but<br>in this case it's a prefix<br>indicating<br>uh a role or a responsibility so karakia<br>literally means as a prayer or can mean<br>to<br>pray and so with the prefix k<br>aikarakia so indicating a type of of<br>Mahi or a role so meaning the person<br>who's delivered the karakia<br>uh and so with this sentence here I want<br>to also note a few important points<br>common phrase to say hello to one person<br>dinner literally meaning that<br>meaning you<br>and so<br>I prefer to use the phrase when thanking<br>someone for a role like presenting<br>karakia with the direct<br>uh Mickey<br>or acknowledgment Dena<br>some of us may use the phrase<br>gelda literally meaning<br>um well here's a whole whole range of<br>meanings hello thank you but for me I<br>highly recommend when acknowledging<br>someone for a role like a karakia I<br>would use<br>it's focused it's directed specifically<br>to them so you would insert the proper<br>name so then now we're here more<br>literally meaning for has other meanings<br>broadly because we can insert other<br>couple or terms<br>so then a literally means this<br>uh why broadly time<br>and so we could some of us would have an<br>understanding of a range of<br>um or terms in relation to time<br>so we could insert in regards to what<br>particular time of the day so we're in<br>uh the afternoon<br>foreign<br>in the evening<br>or<br>broadly some of us would have an<br>understanding of the word ra<br>so practice oh no I<br>um<br>together so insert appropriate name your<br>own name and choose a time of day or you<br>can use wa<br>then<br>foreign<br>so somebody has<br>um letter of discussion or presented so<br>we can thank them for their gorero<br>so as we had um<br>we have a Kai gorilo<br>oops I'll just do<br>that jumped in<br>all right so very similar to our karakia<br>example<br>and so if you don't know their name and<br>I stepped over that and now our<br>kaikarakia slide<br>a particle appropriate to use you can<br>use it<br>with one or two syllable<br>so you couldn't use it for not my name<br>then Aqua air hedia because there's<br>um so yeah replacing like auditor with a<br>name<br>um<br>sorry either one syllable or two<br>syllable names you can use but if you<br>another couple of phrases which some of<br>you may have an understanding of<br>uh<br>use it or him<br>so other examples of acknowledging<br>um the kiteboard it or someone who<br>shared a discussion leader discussion or<br>a presentation<br>um and so we could use<br>a common term<br>um<br>we've we've here in the media over here<br>with each other so giving literally<br>meaning<br>another two with which personalizes it<br>more directly which I prefer to use Aku<br>meaning mine<br>um<br>foreign<br>have seen some of these phrases before<br>uh and preferably used<br>um when you see them in in person<br>uh and so this is a little bit of a<br>uh a whakapapa I suppose uh and so<br>so directly to you uh you're great<br>synonyms<br>um<br>exemplifies it a bit for the want of a<br>so you but more than great you're<br>awesome<br>uh and then if you're you're absolutely<br>so you can see the insertion so we had<br>and then we've inserted<br>to expand it<br>um or accentuate your your Mickey to the<br>uh they did a good job<br>they were<br>stunning they were outstanding<br>more of a colloquial a couple of terms<br>here that you could acknowledge others<br>so if somebody has said something pretty<br>sharp<br>uh transliteration of clever<br>um so an example there of a<br>transliteration common uh and use<br>you're so clever<br>or You're beautiful your handsome<br>cookies<br>in finishing with<br>a few other phrases which some of you<br>um have might have seen before as well<br>and here I've used um the phrase<br>so we know that real uh is language and<br>whakamana to praise or uplift someone<br>example of Praise phrases<br>you're amazing<br>and you're the best you're you're<br>stunning<br>uh so that's what I have for this<br>morning<br>um I can respond to any questions in the<br>chat if I haven't<br>um explain something clearly or if you<br>have other questions in regards to<br>um<br>types of mehi or in regards to types of<br>uh real whakamana so just pause to see<br>if you have any<br>uh totally so uh some examples all of<br>them could be used as written or oral<br>and answering um Francesca's question<br>uh yeah Tracy I think um Ellen will be<br>sharing both the recordings and verse<br>yeah the recordings will be available so<br>the slides will be available<br>um cup white and we have a question<br>um from Tatiana uh what does the<br>prefix<br>um uh mean means to and it's most<br>basic form<br>um to do<br>something so we know a lot of us know<br>that Mana is<br>um<br>well it's a tricky tricky term to<br>explain Mana but to so the um makes<br>it<br>um<br>uh of<br>a verb so<br>indicating the the Mahi faka Mana<br>um are some words that you might have<br>have heard as well<br>um so we've used mihi as an<br>acknowledgment<br>um so indicating a type of of mahi<br>um<br>just looking at some of the questions<br>here so picture<br>um<br>could you say that a couple way okinoki<br>but yes you could say<br>um<br>so I love this and suiting the language<br>that a lot of you have as well so<br>is there a way to make these specific to<br>a children<br>um if you are using personal pronouns in<br>relation to children they're applicable<br>to any age<br>um you could say for a child<br>um<br>for a boy thank you<br>um<br>um<br>can you please go over and say we slow<br>okay so the question<br>um there's a couple of questions here so<br>um in regards to dinner<br>asking is this after someone else's yeah<br>so it's not acknowledging whoever may<br>um<br>foreign<br>um yeah you could so Valerie's asked<br>um could we replace wa with we yes<br>question from Chris about can you talk a<br>bit more about care and what it what it<br>does uh yes there's a whole cope up a<br>big cope up around itself and<br>um<br>so no I won't Chris talk about care and<br>um yeah Sandra I'm just reading I was<br>wondering why that's why I thought<br>cowboy was a Cowboy is um can also so<br>um Sandra's question is car is a future<br>tense car can also be<br>um as currently happening right now if<br>that's helpful for you<br>okay<br>that's fine okay okay<br>um so close question around<br>um<br>uh hooky can mean a whole range of<br>um<br>bit has a whole range of of meanings<br>um basic meaning as well<br>um so hooky you could use Glo hooky as<br>me too<br>um in relation to the phrases I've given<br>I'm giving emphasis is another way same<br>as the cuckoo like tonu can mean as well<br>but it can also emphasize a particular<br>phrase<br>any other parts I will you have me on<br>okay I'll go over some pronunciation<br>then<br>and maybe incorporate<br>oops<br>I've just<br>oh<br>yeah so I'll review our slides in review<br>some of the questions that were were<br>shared as well<br>uh so practicing using this as an<br>opportunity to practice your<br>pronunciation<br>uh so insert appropriate name maybe look<br>at using a different time of day uh in<br>oh goodbye Millie uh so question what<br>would be appropriate to use with older<br>people similar to the question around<br>um using personal pronouns with children<br>so<br>um this is a lot of us have uh<br>vocabulary around uh distinguishing<br>between different people and so you<br>could<br>um<br>if we're looking at the phrase at the<br>moment<br>um<br>so we know that Clover<br>is an elderly man<br>um elderly woman<br>um so again all of these phrases<br>appropriate for a whole range of<br>different types of people and so<br>inserting ingwa or name<br>and recognizing<br>um<br>so the question in reiterating what I<br>shared in regards to using uh what is<br>the difference between using namahi and<br>akumihi namahi definitely more broad so<br>now he literally means acknowledgments<br>um personal acknowledgment to you so<br>yeah if you want to use could be like<br>more personal hearts out yes definitely<br>okay go back to to practicing<br>um<br>the mighty child<br>so inserting a whole range of of roles<br>as possible<br>there<br>or like I said earlier if you don't know<br>their name you could use the default<br>then<br>so recognizing that role<br>claiming that prefix indicating<br>um that it's a role or a responsibility<br>uh and then in a different context so<br>uh if they<br>um<br>oops and so we had we had that<br>difference and personalizing up for more<br>sorry and now Mickey I prefer also to be<br>more direct when you say namah<br>instead of onami<br>um isn't very direct to me<br>um<br>and finally some a couple of slides of<br>Praises that you might use that you can<br>use most written or orally in your<br>emails<br>and so we had a question earlier you<br>could replace<br>with<br>um<br>Christian<br>anybody's got these options in there<br>um<br>okay<br>uh<br>okay<br>um yep I'll put it in the chat I can do<br>that<br>um so that it's recorded as well so<br>um<br>where to buy<br>I'll see where I can put that on my<br>channel<br>actually no I'm not going to put that in<br>the chat I am going to use it you know<br>to challenge yourselves as looking at<br>you'll get these slides<br>um but looking at different types of<br>parts of the day easy to find kopu in<br>relation to the the times of of the day<br>so<br>no I am I'm not going to put them in the<br>great uh so Rachel's asking yes when<br>it's a one or so Nate says put a<br>question I could say thinner<br>innate but I couldn't say<br>because there's three syllables to my<br>name so yeah<br>um good question Rachel good reminder<br>too<br>um<br>one or two syllable names or one or two<br>where'd you put it no I just did that<br>sorry Karen sorry so with idiot no you<br>um with with three syllables thinner<br>we're innate dinar with EK Erin<br>um but not<br>um<br>okay<br>um hopefully then you're going to go<br>away uh and either use these with your<br>students use these with your colleagues<br>um use them in your emails<br>um and yeah do some homework in some<br>cases and and extending your vocab<br>um<br>yeah so that that is US quickly with<br>Paul<br>and so what does pudding uh so the quick<br>last questions here air a grammatical<br>undefined<br>um particle<br>um as you know with many different<br>languages so that's how I'm going to<br>explain it for now what difference does<br>it make adding Nui to the Nami hinui no<br>like to know like bookie couple like<br>that<br>um giving it more emphasis if that's<br>helpful for you Paul<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
