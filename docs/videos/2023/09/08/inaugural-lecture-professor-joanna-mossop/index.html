However, sustainability has been difficult to achieve. Over time, activities at sea have increased while the health of the ocean has declined due to pollution, over-exploitation, climate change and failures in regulation and enforcement. Numerous international organisations have a role in ocean governance, however their efforts have been fragmented and at times inadequate. In a positive development, the United Nations have this year adopted a new treaty, the Agreement on Marine Biodiversity beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement), intended to improve conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.<br><br>In this lecture, Professor Joanna Mossop asks whether changes to regulate ocean activities more sustainably can be achieved through evolution of the law and will explore the role that fresh perspectives may play in the future. Do UNCLOS and existing processes provide a sufficient basis for responding to new challenges, or is revolution needed?</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may

and<br>it's my enormous pleasure to welcome uh<br>friends family distinguished guests<br>professional and academic colleagues to<br>the inaugural lecture of Professor<br>Joanna mossup um I often say and I'm<br>only being semi verious when I say it<br>that one of the jobs of the vice<br>Chancellor in addition to running the<br>university is to live vicariously<br>through the achievements of others and<br>uh Joanna has given me a long list of<br>achievements for which I can do quite a<br>lot of living for tonight um she she<br>built a base on those achievements by<br>doing uh a double degree at this<br>outstanding University and indeed<br>in this outstanding faculty of law um<br>she was then admitted to the New Zealand<br>High Court as a barrister and solicitor<br>in 1997 and began her career as a<br>solicitor at but Finlay after that she<br>then worked as an assistant Crown<br>counsel in the Crown Law Office before<br>heading overseas to Columbia University<br>where she completed her masters of law<br>in international<br>studies uh thankfully for us uh she<br>returned to ATA to work uh at this Law<br>School in 2003 first as a lecturer then<br>as a senior lecturer then as an<br>associate professor and to hear we are<br>today as a full Professor uh for those<br>uh of you who know Joanna's work uh<br>we're incredibly lucky to have her her<br>research interests include dispute<br>settlement of the sea in matters<br>regulation of continental shelf Beyond<br>200 nautical miles protections of marine<br>diversity Marine resource management and<br>oceans government and at a time when our<br>oceans are ring are rising and our<br>temperatures are increasing that area<br>body of work is increasingly more and<br>more relevant uh she's considered a<br>global expert in in the continental<br>shelf her book continental shelf Beyond<br>200 nautical miles rights and<br>responsibilities jointly won the JF Nory<br>Memorial prize for the best legal book<br>uh by a new zealand-based author she's<br>been involved in negotiations for a new<br>treaty and conservation and<br>sustainability sustainable use of marine<br>biodiversity in areas Beyond national<br>jurisdiction and is published widely on<br>the topic um she's known as so many good<br>academics are not just within her field<br>but beyond her field as well uh she's a<br>legal adviser to maius and the SE shells<br>and which I commented to her as we're<br>walking in which seemed to me to have<br>provided wonderful opportunities for uh<br>holidays in addition to work she<br>responded rather drily that that was<br>during Co and so it meant Zoom<br>conversations in the middle of the<br>night um but this is the first time in<br>the world that any two countries have<br>sought to establish uh a regime together<br>to govern uh the use of the oceans<br>beyond that 200 nautical mile limit<br>she's a member of multiple editorial<br>boards including the leading multi-<br>interdisciplinary journal for oceans<br>marine policy and it's active in the<br>Australia New Zealand uh Society of<br>international law also as academics who<br>Moved not just within their own field<br>but also do enormous service beyond the<br>university and also internal to the<br>university and Joanna was no exception<br>she was the associate Dean uh Research<br>In The Faculty of Law and also and I<br>think this actually points to a very<br>exciting next uh 45 minutes or so uh<br>she's she's a a renowned teacher within<br>this University um she her teaching was<br>recognized with an Excellence award in<br>2018 and just yesterday I was talking to<br>one of our students and I often asked<br>them in the mystery shopper mode who<br>their favorite academic and their<br>favorite lecturer and this student<br>looked at me without pause and said that<br>would have to be Professor mossup so<br>that bodess well for the lecture that<br>she's about to<br>give on reimagining the lore of the sea<br>she's going to talk about Evolution and<br>she's going to talk about revolutions<br>specifically asking whether changes to<br>regulate ocean activities more<br>sustainably can be achieved through the<br>evolution of the law or more<br>specifically if the United Nations<br>convention on the law of the sea and<br>existing processes provide sufficient<br>basis for responding to New Challenges<br>or if Revolution is needed it's my great<br>pleasure ladies and gentlemen friends<br>and colleagues to introduce Professor<br>my<br>well thank you very much for that kind<br>introduction Nick I'm not quite sure who<br>um if that was it was actually me you<br>were talking about um but thank you<br>everyone for coming um I've just<br>explained that although my ancestors<br>came to altero from other places I was<br>born and grew up in New Plymouth under<br>mount tanaki in that vein I want to<br>acknowledge my family who are here today<br>uh including my father who still lives<br>in New Pou however I have lived and<br>worked in Wellington for many years and<br>have I am very proud to have worked at<br>tah and aaka for over 20 years and it is<br>really wonderful to see you all here<br>today I occasionally get asked why do I<br>study the law of the sea uh which is a<br>highly specialized area of international<br>law and indeed um something that not<br>many people know about including the<br>students many of the students who sign<br>up for my law of the sea course but ever<br>since I wrote my honors paper on<br>Fisheries during my undergraduate law<br>degree um the law of the sea has really<br>hold my<br>imagination most of us don't really<br>experience the sea much further than<br>when we go to the Beach perhaps going<br>surfing or um fishing indeed my husband<br>and I are Keen snorklers um and I've had<br>a long um sense of awe and Fascination<br>about the Kaleidoscope of Life below the<br>waves and places where humans can only<br>briefly Venture the slideshow prior to<br>my lecture was my attempt to share that<br>Wonder with<br>you the ocean covers 70% of the planet<br>surface and it is a place of incredible<br>extremes of remoteness of temperature<br>and of ecology indeed today just before<br>the lecture I was reading that<br>scientists have just discovered that<br>there are species of tube worms that<br>tunnel underneath the seabed In Search<br>of new hydrothermal vents and this<br>ongoing discovery of new and amazing<br>things about the ocean it just really is<br>fantastic so the majority don't of us<br>don't engage a lot with the ocean<br>directly um but it is inre incredibly<br>important to our lives it's a road 98%<br>of New Zealand's imports and exports<br>travel by the ocean it provides food<br>billions of people rely on Pro on<br>Seafood as the key source of their<br>protein it is a source of important<br>minerals and<br>hydrocarbons in addition the ocean is<br>essential to our health 50% of the<br>oxygen that we breathe is generated from<br>the oceans it also regulates our climate<br>ocean uh currents are uh crucial to our<br>climate the ocean absorbs 25% of carbon<br>dioxide emissions and captures 90% of<br>the excess heat that is generated from<br>those<br>emissions the ocean also plays an<br>important sometimes essential role in<br>Social and cultural<br>values despite this importance how we<br>use our oceans as having a detrimental<br>effect on its health<br>over fishing continues to deplete<br>ecosystems the food and agriculture<br>organization estimates that around 35%<br>of commercial fish species are either<br>overfished or<br>depleted although work has been done to<br>try to reduce the environmental impact<br>of fishing quite successfully in some<br>areas in other areas it has not been as<br>successful and in that species are<br>caught as by catch or the impact of the<br>fishing techniques themselves can be<br>very detrimental to the<br>environment pollution from a variety of<br>sources including Land and Sea are<br>sometimes only um adequately managed we<br>have all seen the pictures of plastic<br>pollution and Plastics are now being<br>found in the most remote part of the<br>ocean including the Mariana Trench at<br>the deepest part is 11 km below the<br>surface of the<br>ocean the impact that humans are having<br>on the ocean is only exacerbated by the<br>impacts of climate change<br>oceans are suffering from record heat<br>waves which are wiping out species or<br>forcing them to relocate if they are<br>able to do that the increasing acidity<br>of the water caused by the absorption of<br>too much carbon dioxide prevents coral<br>reefs shellfish lobsters and more from<br>forming their shells and skeletons and<br>personally I see that sometimes when I'm<br>snorkeling and I it is heartbreaking<br>indeed the picture in some ways is very<br>bleak<br>so the question that I want to address<br>today is how well is the law of the sea<br>placed to deal with the challenges that<br>I have just outlined spoiler alert I<br>will argue that it will it faces some<br>significant problems in that case how<br>can we shape the law of the sea um to<br>ensure that the oceans have a more<br>sustainable future um and because that's<br>quite a large topic uh and many of my<br>comments tonight are going to focus on<br>Fisheries to to begin I'm going to take<br>us back to<br>1982 in addition to the release of the<br>film ET and the start of the Forkland<br>War there was one other important uh<br>occasion in 1982 and that was the<br>conclusion of the UN convention on the<br>law of the sea often referred to as<br>anos anos has been hailed as one of the<br>most successful International treaties<br>in history and one swoop orbe it a swoop<br>that took 10 years to negotiate unclos<br>resolved many um issues uh among states<br>about the extent of Maritime zones<br>rights of navigation rights of<br>exploitation of living and non-living<br>resources Maritime um scientific<br>research and many more it has been<br>hailed both as a constitution for the<br>Seas and as a living treaty capable of<br>developing and adapting to meet new<br>challenges now this adaptation is<br>unlikely to happen through the amendment<br>of The the treaty itself as there is<br>little appetite both among Foreign<br>Affairs officials and many academics to<br>reopen the careful balancing that unclos<br>represents instead evolution of the law<br>has occurred in an incremental fashion<br>for example shortly after the conclusion<br>of the uh law of the sea convention<br>problems were identified that needed<br>further elaboration and to do this a<br>couple of new treaties were signed in<br>1994<br>1995 which uh tried to uh expand and<br>elaborate on the obligations States owed<br>um in relation to De seed Mining and<br>highing and migratory uh fish<br>stocks and I want to pause here to say<br>that I am a huge fat advocate for the<br>majority of what unclos does it has<br>brought incredible stability to the<br>ocean and the way that countries<br>interact on that ocean and has been the<br>basis for orderly development of the law<br>in a whole range of important issues<br>including for example shipping and<br>pollution from<br>vessels however I think we also have to<br>acknowledge that the law of the sea has<br>not prevented the creation of an<br>increasingly degraded marine environment<br>negatively impacted by human activities<br>and exacerbated by human induced climate<br>change I believe that this is due in<br>part to the fact that states often view<br>the ocean primarily as an economic<br>resource<br>Most states or many states have<br>significant interests in a range of<br>activities including fishing mining um<br>and oil and those vested interests<br>underpin the political positions<br>expressed in inter International<br>fora certainly many of these states also<br>accept that the oceans must be used<br>sustainably but for others their<br>positions are driven by an interest in<br>maximizing the value that they get from<br>the<br>ocean many of enos's provisions on<br>issues like Fisheries are driven by<br>old-fashioned approaches that refer to<br>fish as living resources and more modern<br>approaches to Environmental Management<br>such as ecosystems approaches and the<br>precautionary approach and valuing<br>biodiversity have had to be retrofitted<br>onto a regime that still reflects<br>somewhat outdated<br>values in 2018 I published an article as<br>you can see on the slide can we make the<br>oceans Greener um trying to argue that<br>um the green obviously refers to um<br>environmental friendliness and not the<br>actual color green um and I talked about<br>the successes and failures of unclos as<br>an environmental treaty in that piece I<br>argued that despite important progress<br>made in uncloth towards uh Environmental<br>Protection a number of structural and<br>other failures have prevented it from<br>being a truly transformative<br>treaty so I'll just talk to you about a<br>few of those issues that I identified<br>and one key issue is that fixation on<br>the freedom of the high seas<br>particularly when it comes to<br>fishing the concept of fishing of the<br>freedom of fishing was predicated on the<br>idea that every um State could send<br>their fishermen out and to collect fish<br>with no detrimental impact on the ocean<br>and it would meet the needs of everyone<br>who who wanted them and this is clearly<br>in modern times not true since the 1960s<br>we've had the language of the tragedy of<br>the commons to describe the fact<br>that common resources with no limit or<br>on access will inevitably you be used<br>unsustainably although the law of the<br>sea has imposed important limits on the<br>freedoms to fish Rosemary Ru has argued<br>that the reification of the freedom or<br>at least any rate the rhetoric of<br>Freedom hinders the ability of the law<br>of the sea to develop in a way that<br>addresses multiple challenges posed by<br>contemporary and emerging ocean uses<br>in the words of other Scholars the<br>default position is that states can fish<br>until they agree not to<br>fish other structural issues in the law<br>of the Sea include the strong dependence<br>on exclusive flag State jurisdiction and<br>the existence of open Registries and<br>flags of<br>convenience another issue is the<br>doctrine of<br>patus um that states are only Bound by<br>treaty rules to which they agree and<br>this is another problem when trying to<br>govern result sources found in Commons<br>areas where no state has territorial<br>jurisdiction another issue is that<br>unclos did not create a body with<br>overarching responsibility for<br>addressing new and emerging issues that<br>arise in respect of the ocean although<br>we have a number of Institutions that<br>address sectoral issues such as the<br>international Maritime organization the<br>international seabed Authority or<br>regional fisheries management<br>organizations there is usually very<br>little coordination between them<br>when narrowing in on the governance of<br>Fisheries on the high seas we see more<br>problems because of the principle of<br>freedom of fishing the only way to<br>ensure sustainab Fisheries has been the<br>creation of regional fisheries<br>management organizations or<br>rfmos only states that join the<br>organization are bound by the rules<br>generally although the fish stocks<br>agreement did expand the scope of those<br>rules in a in important ways while some<br>rfmos have managed to achieve sustain<br>ability as many as 67% of high seas fish<br>stocks are depleted or<br>overfished although arimo treaties do<br>contain a mandate to consider<br>Environmental Protection Studies have<br>suggested that the priority and sole<br>focus of many member states has been to<br>guide the exploitation of fish<br>stocks some rfmos use consensus<br>decision- making which requires all<br>states to agree before a conserv<br>conservation measure can be implemented<br>and this can be make it difficult to<br>achieve limits on Fisheries<br>activity even where the rfmo has a<br>majority based decision-making process<br>states are usually able to object to a<br>conservation and management measure or<br>and opt out of implementing<br>it in addition the rfmos are often a<br>fairly closed Club only states with a<br>real interest in fishing are entitled to<br>join them and new entrance often find<br>their allocated no or limited<br>quota the fact that decisions in rfmos<br>are made by those interested in fishing<br>mean that there is even more<br>conservation-minded States find it hard<br>to make<br>progress the accountability of rfmos to<br>the rest of the International Community<br>for their management of this this common<br>resource is paper thin although some<br>rfmos are now undertaking peer reviews<br>of their performance States outside the<br>organization have no ability to<br>influence decision- making or hold hold<br>management that's a very Grim picture<br>but um let's have a look at so see where<br>we can we can go from here in 2019 the<br>intern intergovernmental science policy<br>platform on biodiversity and ecosystem<br>Services bit of a mouthful issued a<br>report that identified the DI state that<br>biodiversity and ecosystems are in the<br>authors of that report argued that<br>Improvement in biodiversity management<br>required transformative change meaning a<br>fundamental systemwide reorganization<br>across technical economic and social<br>factors including paradigm's goals and<br>values this was a call to action um and<br>it's a call that hasn't really resonated<br>too well but it has led me to wonder<br>whether the law of the sea can also<br>biodiversity I'm now going to address<br>the traditional approach to developing<br>the law which which I'm referring to as<br>Evolution and this is indeed uh the way<br>in which law of the sea has developed to<br>date Professor Karen Scott from<br>Canterbury University recently<br>identified 12 ways in which the rules<br>laid down in unclo can be developed to U<br>meet emerging needs without amending the<br>treaty these included negotiating new<br>treaties uh developing soft law or<br>guidelines and seeking Progressive<br>interpretation through courts and<br>tribunals the main mainstream view of<br>unclos tells us that evolution in the<br>law is the only way to deal with<br>challenges and problems and certainly<br>The evolutionary or incremental approach<br>has underpinned my scholarship uh for<br>most of my<br>career however of late I have been<br>become increasingly uneasy about faith<br>that incremental Evolution will be<br>sufficient to meet the new and serious<br>challenges facing the<br>ocean in 2018 my answer to the problem I<br>identified was to focus on the<br>negotiations for a new agreement in the<br>United Nations focused on the<br>conservation and sustainable use of<br>marine biodiversity in areas Beyond<br>national jurisdiction and whether that<br>could soften some of the structural<br>problems that I identified in the<br>article so I want to now turn to those<br>treaty negotiations because it's a<br>process I've been involved in as an<br>academic Observer on the New Zealand<br>delegation um and I think it tells us<br>something about the promises and<br>limitations of evolution as a means to<br>uh solve the difficult problems that we<br>face I should also say that nothing in<br>this talk reflects the views of the New<br>Zealand government I'm sure they'd be<br>happy for me to say that um so that<br>process began in 2006 when the United<br>Nations General Assembly convened a<br>series of ad hoc informal working group<br>meetings to discuss a variety of issues<br>that related to um biodiversity in areas<br>Beyond national jurisdiction and this<br>process because in international law<br>everything has a hugely long name is<br>known as the bbnj process for<br>biodiversity Beyond national<br>jurisdiction this slide shows the V<br>variety of Maritime zones created by<br>enclo and now states have jurisdiction<br>over fisheries and and some other<br>activities out to 200 nautical miles<br>from the coastline um and the areas that<br>were being discussed in the bb&amp; J<br>process were the areas Beyond any<br>national state jurisdiction namely the<br>high seas and the Deep seabed<br>area now a wide range of issues were<br>raised during the initial meetings but<br>states were very divided at the<br>beginning as to whether a new treaty was<br>needed or whether the challenges could<br>be met through existing<br>institutions in 2011 agreement was<br>reached on four key areas that would<br>form the basis of a new treaty and I'll<br>just briefly outline those the first one<br>was the legal regime for the<br>exploitation of marine genetic resources<br>um for the used for the development of<br>biotechnology understandably unclos was<br>silent about the rules for developing<br>biotechnology because it just simply<br>wasn't a use that was envisaged uh when<br>it was<br>negotiated from the beginning of the bb&amp;<br>J discussions there was a clear division<br>between industrialized countries that<br>wanted to apply the freedoms of the high<br>seas to that um activity and the global<br>South who wanted the principle of the<br>common Heritage of humankind to apply<br>and I'll come back to that uh concept<br>negotiations for a new treaty um did<br>establish a legal regime that applied to<br>the access and use of these resources<br>importantly that included a benefit<br>sharing approach but it didn't<br>explicitly uh rely on freedoms or common<br>Heritage the second issue was area-<br>based Management on the high seeds there<br>is no um basis in unclo explicitly there<br>to create Marine protected areas and<br>other area based management tools um<br>especially those that might address more<br>than one activity fisheries and Mining<br>and so forth the treaty negotiations<br>explored how such areas might be<br>identified and<br>established third the treaty<br>negotiations focused on elaborating the<br>process for conducting environmental<br>impact assessments for activities on the<br>high seas and the these will need to be<br>undertaken when states are planning<br>activities that might have a negative<br>impact on the marine<br>environment finally the issue of<br>capacity building and Marine technology<br>transfer for developing States was um a<br>South so in 2018 an intergovernmental<br>conference was convened to negotiate the<br>treaty the final meeting was held in<br>March this year and the treaty was<br>adoped Ed in the United Nations in June<br>this year and the treaty as I said is<br>commonly referred to as the bbnj<br>agreement but it's also sometimes<br>referred to as the high seas<br>treaty negotiations for the treaty were<br>very difficult despite the fact that<br>more than 10 years of discussions<br>preceded the beginnings of the<br>negotiations the current geopolitical<br>climate particularly made uh<br>multilateral processes much more fra<br>than in the past and one delegation in<br>particular seemed keen on throwing<br>Spinners in the works at every possible<br>opportunity um the positions of states<br>in the global North and the global South<br>were very apart far apart on a wide<br>range of very important<br>issues even in the last session the<br>differences were so great that the final<br>day of the negotiations began at 9:00<br>a.m. on Friday ran through the night<br>into the next day and it was only 9:00<br>p.m. the following night that the<br>president of the conference announced<br>that an agreement had been reached and<br>even a few hours before that point no<br>one had been really confident that there<br>would be able to be agreement so it was<br>a really tremendous activity and it<br>shows how difficult it was to bridge the<br>positions held by a range of different<br>states there is no doubt that the new<br>agreement is incredibly important it<br>develops the law of the sea in some very<br>important ways in relation to the four<br>elements of the treaty there are now<br>clear processes for undertaking<br>environmental impact assessments and<br>establishing Marine protected areas<br>rules about accessing Marine genetic<br>resources are set out and Provisions<br>have been made for benefits to flow to<br>the global<br>cell the agreement also created<br>institutions that could develop Norms on<br>these issues even further the creation<br>of a regular meeting of the conference<br>of parties uh goes a long way to filling<br>some of the institutional gaps that that<br>I identified in my 2018<br>article the key question I have been<br>asking myself however is is this enough<br>does the BBJ agreement demonstrate that<br>iterative evolution is sufficient to<br>resolve the sustainability problems<br>facing Marine<br>biodiversity and I'm going to just now<br>tell you three key ways in which I am<br>less optimistic about this approach than<br>I was when I wrote my Article 5 years<br>ago first and probably most importantly<br>the treaty does not apply to existing<br>institutions such as<br>rfmos one of the political compromises<br>that were made in 2011 when the<br>agreement was reached as to what a<br>potential treaty would cover was that<br>the agreement could not undermine<br>relevant legal instruments and<br>Frameworks and relevant Global Regional<br>subregional and sectoral bodies this<br>means that the bb&amp; J agreement could not<br>undermine<br>rfmos of of course what it means to<br>undermine was different to each<br>delegation those with significant<br>interests in rfmos tended to take the<br>view that the bb&amp; J agreement could not<br>touch on Fisheries issues if an rfmo<br>exists some argue that fishery should be<br>excluded from the treaty altogether<br>which in my view was um ridiculous given<br>that the subject of the treaty was<br>Marine<br>biodiversity that position fortunately<br>did not<br>Prevail however the BBN J agreement and<br>decisions of the cop cannot override<br>rfmos or require rfmos to take any<br>action for example if the cop identifies<br>an area that requires a marine protected<br>area on the high seas only the rfmo that<br>applies to that area will be able to<br>decide if Fisheries restrictions uh can<br>be imposed and given the problems with<br>rfmo decision makings that I alluded to<br>earlier there is a real possibility that<br>the cop May identify and designate an<br>MPA but the rfmo May refuse to take any<br>protective measures in that<br>area the main potential for the bbnj to<br>influence rfmo decisions is through the<br>actions of states that are members of<br>both the bb&amp; agreement and the relevant<br>rfmo State's party to the bbnj are<br>legally obliged under the agreement to<br>Endeavor to promote the objectives of<br>the agreement when participating in<br>decision-making other<br>bodies it is possible that the bbnj<br>agreement could lift the standards of<br>rfmos indirectly through such States<br>proposing measures that are consistent<br>with the bbnj<br>agreement such a lifting of Standards<br>occurred under the fish stocks agreement<br>in<br>1995 when uh rfmos introduced standards<br>that were consistent with the fish<br>stocks agreement even though not all<br>members of the rfmo had yet signed<br>signed that treaty so it is<br>possible however when in current<br>climates certain rfmo member states are<br>uninterested seemingly in agreeing to<br>conservation initiatives it is likely<br>that there will be an uphill battle in<br>those organizations for this indirect<br>influence to be<br>successful it comes as no surprise that<br>states were interested and maximizing<br>their self-interest during the BBJ<br>negotiations or that important fishing<br>States wanted to minimize<br>or exclude the application of the bb&amp; J<br>agreement to Fisheries decisions made in<br>rfmos are made between the states only<br>the states that have a common interest<br>in exploitation of the relevant fish<br>stocks the idea that the rest of the<br>International Community might want to<br>have a say in how fishing is undertaken<br>would be anathema to those States and<br>yet in my view the International<br>Community does have a real interest in<br>how well rfmos are managing biodiversity<br>essentially under their<br>control a second potential limitation on<br>the impact of the bb&amp; J agreement is<br>that none of the underlying structural<br>problems contained in unclo or indeed an<br>international law are addressed again<br>this is no surprise to anyone who was<br>following the<br>negotiations although the 1994 and to<br>some extent the 1995 implementing<br>agreements uh amended key Provisions or<br>um elaborated on them in very important<br>ways there was very little interest in<br>taking a similarly uh ambitious approach<br>in the bbnj<br>agreement in addition the principle of<br>patus will apply to the new<br>agreement this means that only parties<br>to the agreement will be bound by the<br>treaty this means um so we can imagine<br>that some key States will not ratify the<br>treaty certainly Russia won't<br>probably the United States won't and<br>there may be some concern over whether<br>Japan and China will ratify the<br>treaty this might mean that key<br>oceangoing States will not be bound by<br>decisions in including in the<br>establishment of marine protected areas<br>or in the sharing of benefits from the<br>use of marine genetic<br>resources it is very easy for companies<br>and vessels to move their operations or<br>re flag to new countries to avoid<br>additional burdens in osed by the new<br>agreement if a May if a major<br>geoengineering company wants to conduct<br>large scale experiments on the high seas<br>they would logically choose to to base<br>themselves in a country that won't<br>impose the pretty rigorous environmental<br>impact assessment procedure contained in<br>the treaty similarly companies that are<br>interested in developing biodiversity<br>from species found on the high seas may<br>choose to base themselves in countries<br>not party to the B andj<br>agreement a third and slightly lesser<br>worry for me is the role of the<br>conference of the parties My Hope had<br>been that once the cop was established<br>it might take an expansive role in<br>developing positions on a wide range of<br>issues that impact on Marine<br>biodiversity and not limit itself to the<br>four elements of the package this would<br>go some way to addressing the broader<br>institutional Gap that was left when<br>unclos did not create a governance body<br>whether that happen<br>remains to be seen certainly the states<br>negotiating the agreement did not seem<br>Keen to focus on creating broader<br>obligations beyond the specific um<br>elements of the package while the<br>whether the cop will take on a broader<br>governance role will depend entirely on<br>the political will of the states that<br>ratify the<br>agreement in 1992 in a seminal article<br>Philip ellot argued that unclos was the<br>beginning of a shift from treaties that<br>simply aggregate State interests to a<br>focus on an international public<br>interest in looking back at the slow and<br>limited development of the BB andj<br>agreement while it was in a wonderful<br>achievement I am not optimistic that<br>this move to public uh interest is is<br>actually<br>happening Evolution through iterative<br>development of the law based on<br>principles set out an unclo is less and<br>less looking like it is capable of<br>solving the difficult problems that face<br>the ocean today<br>so this takes us to where the new<br>approaches are<br>needed my current research project is<br>based on a Manon grant that I am working<br>on with uh Dr Ruby moan magig and<br>Professor Richard Barnes in the project<br>called reimagining ocean law for which I<br>have stolen the title of this lecture we<br>are examining critiques of international<br>law and less explored ideas to determine<br>whether we can find a better way to<br>manage the ocean and in the next part of<br>my address I just want to touch on two<br>of the ideas we're exploring that might<br>lead to a legal approach better equipped<br>sustainability the first of these is to<br>explore what it means for the ocean to<br>be viewed as a Global Commons a Global<br>Commons is an area or resource which is<br>held in common by a group fish stocks on<br>the high seas are a classic example of a<br>Global Commons<br>resource the tragedy of the commons<br>tells us that it is preferable for<br>access to and use of a Common's resource<br>to be regulated to prevent unsustainable<br>exploitation which ultimately undermines<br>the interest in the group in the long<br>term in the law of the sea we two see<br>quite two quite different principles<br>that govern Commons resources the first<br>is the freedom of high seas which<br>governs Fisheries the second example is<br>the common Heritage of humankind um<br>which is that applies to to deep seabed<br>mineral resources the treaty um unclo<br>provided for um the sharing of benefits<br>from the exploitation of seabed<br>resources although the bb&amp; J agreement<br>does not directly say it the Genesis of<br>the benefit sharing Provisions was the<br>global South's insistence on using in<br>some way the concept of common Heritage<br>of<br>humankind in my current um research I'm<br>interested in a third approach which is<br>considers the underlying principles or<br>values that emerge from the fact that<br>the ocean is a common<br>area this approach asks if the ocean is<br>a Common's area what are the principles<br>that determine how it should be<br>regulated and this is not a question of<br>whether common Heritage should apply or<br>the freedoms of the high seas should<br>apply this approach Begins by asking<br>what the interests of the International<br>Community are in the way the commons is<br>governed and again I will make comments<br>largely focused on fisheries and<br>apologies to those of you from the<br>ministry of primary Industries in the<br>audience um I I have been somewhat um a<br>bit critical of of Fisheries on the one<br>hand we have the fishing States<br>achieving a benefit from the resources<br>um the benefit is captured um and it's<br>also true that smaller groups of states<br>are not always managing the impact of<br>fishing on the stock or the environment<br>well on the other hand the entire<br>International um Community has an<br>interest in protecting the marine<br>environment and insuring Fisheries are<br>caught sustainably this includes<br>ensuring the oceans remain healthy for<br>climate and ecological Health um as well<br>as ensuring that resources are not<br>overexploited so that future Generations<br>can benefit um from the Environmental<br>Services of those<br>resources and once we identify those<br>values my argument is that any<br>exploitation or activity in the oceans<br>uh can sit on top but not detract from<br>those values to the extent that that<br>regulatory regimes are inconsistent with<br>the values um then they should be<br>changed to reflect the values so what<br>those values are what should those<br>values be well first of all the<br>protection of the marine environment<br>should be the starting point for<br>discussions about<br>exploitation no individual actor should<br>be able to capture the value of common<br>resources in a way that takes away from<br>the community interests thus economic<br>activity should take place in a way that<br>is sustainable and preserves the<br>environment for future<br>Generations there are clear obligations<br>under unclo and many other International<br>instruments such as the convention on<br>biological diversity to ensure<br>protection of the marine environment but<br>as I discussed earlier international law<br>also provides ways for states to act in<br>ways that degrade the environment states<br>often focus on their rights and spend<br>less time thinking about their<br>obligations second organizations that<br>regulate activities impacting on the<br>marine environment should be accountable<br>to the International Community this is<br>particularly important for organizations<br>such as rfmos where decisions are made<br>by a closed subset of the International<br>Community thus transparency is required<br>to allow for accountability as well as<br>mechanisms through which that<br>accountability can be<br>exercised third if a resource or area is<br>owned or shared or have um by the<br>International Community that all have an<br>interest it follows that use of that<br>resource should be Equitable to some<br>extent although many rfmos have treaties<br>that include a mandate including Equity<br>a recent study showed that the role that<br>this principle plays in allocation<br>decisions is variable and unable to be<br>adequately measured more important<br>considerations in those decisions are<br>the historical catch which favors larger<br>existing fishing States<br>although there is a reference to Value<br>such as Equity setl tell us that the<br>actual allocation of resource rights is<br>shaped by the power influence and<br>occasional coercion of individual states<br>rather than the outlined Equity<br>principles so in my view it is worth<br>thinking a little bit more<br>creatively in my law of the SE class I<br>often saved my students that the legal<br>regime in unclass is not where I would<br>start if I was designing a new regime to<br>manage human activities on the oceans so<br>perhaps we need to spend some time<br>thinking about what an ideal approach<br>would look like for example a minor form<br>of Revolution would be to ask experts to<br>determine the capacity of the marine<br>environment to support fishing<br>activities once that capacity is set<br>only then would political decisions<br>about allocation happen a form of<br>area-based management is required so the<br>impact of all activities across all all<br>sectors is planned for more radically we<br>might even imagine some form of sharing<br>of benefits from the exploitation of<br>Fisheries resources especially on the<br>high<br>seas the second category that we will be<br>exploring and this is more in the future<br>are ideas that challenge current<br>assumptions that humans are entitled to<br>order the oceans as they see<br>fit some Scholars have argued that the<br>law of the sea is based on deeply<br>colonialist and capitalist approaches<br>that treat the ocean and its environment<br>as resources to be exploited instead we<br>should be rethinking the very Foundation<br>of our legal<br>structures another recent development<br>has been that has been that that is<br>calling on nature to have rights quite a<br>few jurisdictions have now passed<br>legislation recognizing the rights of<br>particular ecosystems including in New<br>Zealand this approach recognizes the<br>responsibility that humans have in<br>respect of the environment and<br>recognizes nature as a rights bearing<br>subject rather than an object to be<br>owned a rights of nature approach Builds<br>on the idea that humans are in a<br>reciprocal n relationship with human<br>nature sorry with nature human use or<br>activities are conditional on the<br>responsibility to ensure they stay<br>within ecological limits this idea of<br>reciprocity appears in a range of<br>different places including in many<br>indigenous perspectives on the<br>environment our search will be diving<br>into these different perspectives to see<br>what they can offer in reshaping the law<br>applying to Oceans some of these are<br>listed on the slide and many overlap for<br>example the concept of stewardship is<br>the idea that the current International<br>Community is only borrowing the<br>environment from future generations and<br>that um came up in the discussion about<br>Global<br>Commons other approaches argued that the<br>environment cannot be considered as<br>separate from human beings and the<br>relationship between people and the<br>oceans must be more in<br>bence so what can be done of course if<br>one accepts there is truth in the<br>theoretical critiques of the current<br>International legal system and the law<br>of the sea the question remains so what<br>how practically can these critiques be<br>used to reshape the legal order in a way<br>that achieves important outcomes as an<br>academic it is tempting and easy to<br>Simply reply well it's that's my job to<br>have a theoretical discussion but the<br>legal part of my brain refuses to leave<br>the analysis there and that's something<br>that we'll be thinking about as we go<br>through our project so one conclusion<br>might be that Revolution is needed but<br>the revolution that is necessary<br>according to the most critical<br>perspectives would require the<br>International Community to agree to<br>scrap the entire existing legal order in<br>favor of something else I would argue<br>it's akin to the difficulty in<br>convincing the permanent members of the<br>security Council to vote to eliminate<br>the veto power it's like turkey's voting<br>for Christmas um the chances of States<br>giving up their vested in interests<br>without some sort of existential crisis<br>is relatively<br>Slim So this leads me in a full circle<br>to ask whether Revolution is possible<br>through evolution in other words are<br>there paths to a very different outcome<br>using the existing<br>mechanisms the reality is that change is<br>really forced by law law especially<br>international law is a mechanism through<br>which states organize their own Affairs<br>in order to achieve transformative<br>change States themselves have to<br>recognize that their interests lie in<br>true sustainability and a different mode<br>of thinking about the<br>ocean the recent calls for a moratorium<br>on deep sea bed mining perhaps indicates<br>that some states are beginning to see<br>the critical importance of protecting<br>the marine environment over time possib<br>more States will come to the same view<br>but in reality there would need to be a<br>ground swell of support in the<br>International Community for a different<br>way of doing things to achieve<br>transformative<br>change this would require a conversation<br>that includes political leaders and<br>their<br>constituents as I tell my students<br>international law is shaped by<br>politicians who are motivated by what<br>their constituents and local communities<br>care about so perhaps the change starts<br>there and even with the audience in this<br>room before I finish um I just want to<br>say a few words of thanks first of all<br>thank you to everyone for coming tonight<br>and to those who gave their apologies uh<br>working as an academic is not always the<br>easiest job in the world but I do<br>believe it is one of the most rewarding<br>um there are a number of former students<br>in the room um and I thank you for<br>coming teaching is one of the joys of my<br>life and it comforts me that the future<br>is in the hands of passionate motivation<br>and intensely clever people thank you<br>also to my colleagues the law faculty<br>here at tahang aaka is a full of<br>amazingly talented people who care about<br>their students and care about their<br>environment and sorry about their<br>research um both academic and the<br>professional staff who are simply<br>amazing I'm humbled every day by their<br>commitment to the law and to the<br>University thank you also to my family<br>including my dad and my sister my niece<br>and nephew and my husband's family who<br>are here tonight and finally I want to<br>say a very special thank you to my<br>husband escore<br>um I didn't expect that um<br>es Esco you have been my rock and<br>personal cheerleader for the last 12<br>years so thank you very much for your<br>love and support so thank you everyone<br>Oto<br>I think that response says it all ten<br>tenot<br>ten I'm Professor Lee Goden and it is my<br>great pleasure to be the dean of the law<br>school that contains Joanna mossup in it<br>I'd like to acknowledge the vice<br>Chancellor Professor Nick Smith faculty<br>colleagues students and people who've<br>gathered U here today but particularly<br>to acknowledge Joanna's family and<br>husband and to recognize in that<br>acknowledgement the type of support that<br>is needed to continue<br>to support and have the achievement that<br>Joanna has demonstrated tonight comes<br>from a place of much love and support So<br>recognizing that<br>and also it's my particular pleasure to<br>propose the vote of thanks to the<br>colleague that has given you such a<br>wonderful insight to the law of the sea<br>Evolution and<br>Revolution I have some very similar<br>research interests so it's very uh much<br>my pleasure to be able to look across<br>the world work that Joanna has done but<br>I'm a land lobber so much of my work<br>around sustainability comes from<br>freshwater and from landbased<br>environmental law the only time I<br>ventured into the law of the sea and<br>particularly the high seas was in<br>respect of um land-based Marine plastic<br>pollution I hastily<br>retreated<br>because it is<br>complex it is fra politically as Joanna<br>has demonstrated but it also is dealing<br>with such<br>important issues for us and our world as<br>it evolves I was struck by the clarity<br>the conciseness and the succinct way in<br>which Joanna dealt with those complex<br>ideas and law I applaud her insights<br>into thinking about how we might move<br>forward from the vexed unclos high seas<br>regime that has has as as well as uh<br>many wonderful features as Joanna has<br>said also has some entrenched and<br>longstanding problems about how we<br>govern common resources so for those<br>insights that you've offered uh to us<br>today thank you very much<br>Joanna they are very important insights<br>that are are there that will be a<br>platform for future research and I wish<br>you well in those projects and in that<br>thinking and that is is one of the joys<br>of academic life teaching but also the<br>time for reflection and<br>research I'd also like to just take a<br>couple of moments to recognize Joanna's<br>contribution to the faculty in other<br>ways Joanna is a very well regarded<br>colleague she is supportive of her<br>colleagues in all sorts of ways both big<br>and<br>small can I just also thank Joanna as a<br>fairly new Dean when she invited me to<br>dinner along with new early career<br>researchers in the faculty and that just<br>gives you some idea a of the generosity<br>and collegiality of<br>Joanna she also is held in high esteem<br>by her colleagues in terms of her fine<br>scholarship her Outreach and<br>impact after Joanna attended those<br>treaty<br>negotiations she came back to her<br>office and<br>colleagues very good friends<br>had put a paddling<br>pool in her<br>office lots of little sand water and<br>things and just acknowledged and um the<br>congratulations uh to Joanna on her<br>participation in the treaty uh around<br>the high seas in in that gesture and<br>that gesture I think um speaks again<br>volumes about the regard that Joanna is<br>held in and if I could just also take a<br>a moment for a reflection from Professor<br>AET<br>Tinsley as a faculty member Joanna is<br>passionate about protecting and<br>improving law school culture for both<br>staff and students she does this through<br>her willingness to take on<br>administrative roles within the faculty<br>through her commitment to support and<br>dissemination of research and through<br>her care for<br>students I wish to thank Joanna on<br>behalf of the faculty of law for her<br>commitment to supporting research<br>development during her time as associate<br>Dean research Joanna's particular<br>support of early career researchers was<br>of great benefit to the faculty and is<br>to be commended so can I just finish<br>then by<br>acknowledging the wonderful<br>journey seawood journey that Joanna has<br>taken us on tonight and to recognize<br>it's a moment of celebration for us all<br>and a joy to offer this vote of thanks<br>here today so I would ask you to share<br>once again in showing gratitude and<br>celebration of uh Professor Joanna<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
