When you take stock of the region’s unique position in the world, steeped in local Indigenous histories and growing autonomy, we can see that being far from the hubris of Silicon Valley is an asset and not a liability.<br><br>Yet the trend of social design being exported across the globe is predominantly WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic). And despite their good intentions, a lack of ethical guidelines puts designers in social and public sectors at great risk of doing more harm than good. <br><br>The Doing Design Differently tour invites design practitioners, leaders, academics, and students to engage critically and constructively with questions of power and ethics. <br><br>Joining George for this panel will be Cecelia Faumuina, Kaan Hiini and Dr Diana Albarrán González.<br><br>Join us as we try to change how design happens in this part of the world: how design work is commissioned, who gets to be called a designer, and where the benefits and damage of design land.<br><br><br>About the facilitator - George Aye:<br>George Aye co-founded Greater Good Studio to use design to heal, to be just, to be restorative. After seven years at a global innovation firm, he was hired as the first human-centred designer at the Chicago Transit Authority.

without above<br>and below in the light and in the dark<br>so<br>K<br>Cho<br>um just to acknowledge all of the people<br>that bought made today possible um well<br>acknowledge the<br>man acknowledge our Guardians uh mfo and<br>wa mat sitting out there um<br>acknowledging this wonderful building<br>the Spy that we're are in in the land<br>that we are on um to the leaders in the<br>room<br>to our speaker Today George welcome to<br>Oakland and thank you for joining us uh<br>to the to my fellow speakers on the<br>panel uh welcome and looking forward to<br>getting into conversation with you<br>um and to those who organized helped to<br>organize today and to our hosts at<br>University of Oakland the creative arts<br>and industries thank you for having<br>us um and to all of you for tuning up<br>thank you for um your attention thank<br>you for your time uh and uh for your<br>commitment to this uh<br>coopa<br>uh this is work that is very important<br>to all of us who are speaking tonight<br>and probably to all of you in the room<br>tonight um the uh combination of<br>creativity and community work and the<br>possibility that can come out of that so<br>welcome to that Copa and thank you for<br>again for your<br>time<br>uh just to close I wanted to share fi<br>that um I use in my work a lot and<br>guides a lot of our codesign practice uh<br>at Curative<br>um it is it roughly translates to this<br>um through learning comes perception<br>through perception comes awareness<br>through awareness comes understanding<br>through understanding comes knowledge<br>and through knowledge comes well-being<br>for our people so it talks that<br>beautiful process um that takes us from<br>listening very deeply and very carefully<br>community Koto um I'm just here to say a<br>few more words of acknowledgements and<br>um thanks um on behalf of codesign Co so<br>we are a network of practitioners uh<br>learning and sharing about creative ways<br>of um creative and participatory ways to<br>engage people in our work um so firstly<br>thank you to George for coming to the<br>other side of the world to to be with us<br>um and to<br>Jade and Emma blamp for um coordinating<br>a trans Tasman<br>um highly<br>encouraging coordinating<br>facilitating um amazing connections<br>across Australia and altero that have<br>made um this possible this series of<br>wonderful events under the banner of<br>doing design differently so that we can<br>all come together and and connect and<br>learn and share and talk about how we<br>might do design<br>differently um I want to acknowledge and<br>thank our hosts here today in the design<br>programs and the faculty of Creative<br>Arts at w Papa<br>Tomo um thanks also for to for purpose<br>um for their support for this event to<br>cative and KH for hosting us this<br>afternoon another wonderful opportunity<br>to share and learn and thank you to<br>Diana for um for hosting and<br>moderating and struggling<br>through your sickness and I hope that<br>you have some rest ahead of you tomorrow<br>um and thank you very much our panelists<br>KH and<br>Mana<br>no<br>faka Nora<br>AK Teno Teno<br>tenot that is uh a welcome um to the<br>space to this place um and to all of you<br>coming tonight um it really is an honor<br>um to have George join us from almost<br>the other side of the world um and this<br>is I think a whole lot of effort from<br>Diana so I just want to acknowledge all<br>of that um this is our second um<br>redesign seminar in the design program<br>we are a brand new um program we've just<br>completed um as of the end of last year<br>our first cohort of velis and design<br>students and um we're really looking at<br>design in this um transdisciplinary way<br>a way of looking at complex problems um<br>uh and particularly um trying to locate<br>what we do within our particular context<br>so this is a really exciting um<br>presentation that we're looking forward<br>to George and then also the panel<br>discussion as well um so I just want to<br>thank you for your wonderful welcome to<br>us all um Khan and um Cecilia thank you<br>for joining us as well um in the um in<br>the panel discussion and for the our<br>co-hosts as well um I um yeah I'm I'm<br>going to sit back and enjoy the<br>conversations I think um as you<br>introduce this is a really important um<br>discussion that we're going to have<br>today and I wasn't able to join the<br>workshop this morning um but I'm really<br>looking forward to this afternoon so<br>you thank you um by the way that's the<br>director of the design programs<br>Angus um well um yeah good night<br>everyone What<br>notes<br>um oh I'm out of camera maybe it's<br>better no<br>um uh well welcome everyone to for<br>joining us tonight and um you will hear<br>my voice a little bit that is getting<br>recover so apologies if I lose my voice<br>Midway or something or I cough here and<br>there but um thank you for all of the<br>efforts from<br>everyone uh Jade Anna KH Cecilia George<br>everyone that has been part of this<br>involved the support from the kai The<br>Faculty marketing events team yeah thank<br>you for gar too and um to make this<br>night possible so let's start I will<br>just read uh George bio I think he needs<br>no introduction but I will do it anyway<br>and we will continue with his lecture so<br>George is co-founder of greater good<br>Studio to use design to heal to be just<br>to be<br>restorative previously he spent seven<br>years at a global Innovation firm before<br>being hired as the first human Center<br>designer at the Chicago trans Transit<br>Authority since founding great good he<br>guides clients and teams through complex<br>projects that honor reality create<br>ownership and build power he speaks<br>frequently across the US and<br>International<br>George held the position of full<br>Professor ad jointed at the school of<br>the Art Institute of Chicago and now<br>teaches part-time at Northwest<br>Northwestern University so give you paky<br> some Applause for George<br>please wonderful hello everyone it's so<br>nice to be here uh with so many uh uh<br>kind introductions I was starting to<br>feel like a rising Panic on oh my God<br>this is to not be as good as everyone's<br>making it out to be so as we kept adding<br>more and more people they go oh my God<br>this is can we get can we get going so<br>I'm I'm ready to go um it's a real<br>pleasure to be here and I really do want<br>to just acknowledge uh so much effort<br>from Jade and uh from Emma and others<br>and Anna and Diana um as I've been<br>visiting multiple cities I've been<br>sitting feeling a very palpable sense of<br>an enormous amount of Social Capital has<br>been spent organizing and extending<br>towards me and I feel they take that<br>very very seriously and it's caused a<br>lot of anx Society of like don't blow it<br>don't blow it uh so I've been very<br>conscious to not uh to not do so uh but<br>I am very keen to get into a<br>conversation about uh the topic herea<br>because I take I think about this stuff<br>a lot uh and to get into the panel and<br>also try to see if we can have a<br>continued conversation around doing<br>design differently because there is I<br>think a lot of really unique<br>opportunities both in the region and at<br>this time um I just found something new<br>so I'm going to click to this there's a<br>thing I found from LinkedIn and I was<br>able to find this thing so um it turns<br>out that this works so if you if you<br>bring up your phone you can find me on<br>LinkedIn through this stupid QR code but<br>it's very clever because now you don't<br>have to bother trying to work out hey<br>can I awkwardly ask George just just get<br>it from here cool right so if you want<br>to I'd love to connect with you on<br>LinkedIn afterwards um and this thing<br>does I think help is it working<br>yay um I'm going to ask a couple of<br>questions and try to see if we can uh<br>get ourselves<br>started to what degree are folks<br>familiar with human- centered design in<br>this room and I can use basically like a<br>low to medium to high if you're not that<br>familiar you can leave your hand around<br>your midwaist if you're medium maybe<br>around here and if you're very familiar<br>and use it every day go high could you<br>maybe tell us your indication of how<br>familiar look at you there's a ton of<br>wow and some not so this is great thank<br>you so much for that's actually a lot of<br>familiarity it's completely fine if<br>you're not because uh this this talk<br>assumes perhaps very very little convers<br>uh familiarity if you're not familiar um<br>um human Center design tends to proport<br>itself as being very clear and linear<br>and easy because it has cute colored<br>Graphics like these uh describing the<br>process in a one-way shoot right okay<br>and these are our Studios cute color<br>Graphics that describe our process we<br>try to make it as easy as possible to to<br>to follow but the general uh premise<br>along the way the arc is to study humans<br>as they are understand their behavior<br>make insights about them and then make<br>some sort of intervention that might<br>adjust those behaviors and and I want to<br>tell you about the story about how human<br>Center design changed the lives of<br>absolutely millions of people U and it<br>starts with two designers from Stanford<br>uh in California and these are quotes<br>from Stanford's own alumni magazine I'm<br>going to read these mon bones approach<br>smokers on campus and ask them what they<br>habit their complaints were consistent<br>fear of being seen with a cigarette and<br>paranoia about smelling of smoke on a<br>their first prototypes were ad hoc<br>Assemblies of bespoke components and<br>items found on drugstore shelves a uh<br>student team designed a smoking<br>cessation product and they followed<br>everything that was taught to them at<br>Stanford they essentially studied humans<br>as they are looked at the behaviors that<br>they have made insights around those<br>behaviors and then produced<br>interventions that adjusted those<br>behaviors and this is where the story<br>goes a little sideways because actually<br>this this is the story of the jewry<br>cigarette the product that has now<br>become a uh has enormous impact around<br>the world and while I believe that the<br>the earnestness of those two students<br>ABS discussing smoking sociation has<br>proven to be quite effective at for a<br>number of people something has also<br>happened along the way and as they<br>became um steadily more um effective in<br>doing human Center design and sort of<br>using those those insights they also<br>started to notice that this is an<br>incredibly addictive product and it got<br>onto the radar of Philip Morris to add<br>to their addiction portfolio at the<br>value of around about 1.2 sorry 12<br>billion back in<br>2018 because along the way as they were<br>thinking about keeping themselves as a<br>fairly medicinal or clinical product<br>they also started having thoughts around<br>making it be fruit flavored and<br>marketing directly to young people as a<br>new alternative to<br>smoking it's curious about how those<br>decisions get made and curious about how<br>those products that go from being<br>clinical to perhaps commercial and it<br>seems so predictable that a product that<br>is dabbling in addiction might have some<br>Associated risks and it's concerning to<br>me that somewhere along the line they<br>chose One path and not the<br>other maybe in the face of1 billion I<br>don't know how you would face that<br>decision I know I would probably have a<br>very hard time as well and it ends up<br>bringing up the question for me around<br>how did we lose our way how as an<br>industry did we not see this coming when<br>really everyone could have probably told<br>you and it I'm not really highlighting<br>Stanford necessarily per se but I<br>actually think high-end universities<br>that have high reputations perhaps like<br>this one have projects in our works in<br>student Labs where we're debating about<br>something that could be equally<br>dramatically<br>impactful that could cause perhaps large<br>harm under the guise of doing design for<br>them for those individuals how will we<br>know now it's not as though design<br>hasn't had guidelines or criteria or<br>even principles for good design um is<br>anyone familiar with daa Rams D Rams is<br>a legendary living designer uh German uh<br>they led the brawn design company for a<br>long long time uh and the physical<br>products ended up becoming a big<br>reference for Johnny I and their apple<br>design team for for<br>decades now design has had many many<br>different uh Pathways to become the one<br>it is and some of you depending on how<br>much familiarity you have with design<br>might identify on different branches of<br>design uh so it's not as though it's a<br>uniform uh so like monolith but again<br>going back to these principles from Deer<br>arms we have principles we have clear<br>ones and I as a design Professor have<br>taught this one many many times now<br>across these<br>10 the DU cigarette would still pass<br>funny<br>that even number six good design is<br>honest that product will honestly kill<br>you<br>so how is it possible that the jewelry<br>cigarette as cool as that product is and<br>then as potentially destructive as it is<br>get through this is the gold standards<br>know what we essentially have in design<br>is a craft-based system for evaluating<br>what good is and I think it's the one<br>that I tend to dabble in it's the<br>currency we tend to work in as a<br>designer perhaps there and ones that<br>we've been taught this has been<br>primarily the sort of the the main<br>framework to evaluating whether good is<br>and as a design teacher I might wonder<br>if perhaps that's what we are primarily<br>using to evaluate students in their work<br>but I think what I'm trying to identify<br>is a lack of an ethical based framework<br>something that in addition to the<br>craft-based one that we have is what we<br>need that it might not simply be enough<br>to Simply base on Craft whether a<br>student gets a pass or a fail or whether<br>a a student gets funding or not there<br>might have to be some additional<br>questions asked of students so that we<br>don't simply say how cool it is but<br>whether it should exist in the first<br>place at<br>all in lie of there being this larger<br>framework we have this situation it's a<br>booe it's like a bring your own ethics<br>game where the individual team members<br>going into these projects have their own<br>set of individual ethics which may be<br>either under articulated or really clear<br>but is mingled with the other teammates<br>and just blend to get into a little<br>cocktail of Ethics per team per project<br>every single<br>time that's not how an industry works<br>but it's how our industry<br>Works which is kind of funny because it<br>makes us the like if we had maybe stayed<br>in our lane using design to work on<br>Commercial products maybe doing an air<br>freshener for SE Johnson or working at a<br>new app for Starbucks maybe it wouldn't<br>matter so much but design keeps dabbling<br>in areas that are well outside of what<br>it was originally tended for and it<br>makes me wonder perhaps are we becoming<br>a bit of a liability are we actually<br>ready for the projects that we're<br>signing ourselves up for and more<br>importantly for the ones that we're<br>getting invited to maybe assuming that<br>place so let me back up um uh my name is<br>George a I'm one of the co-founders and<br>director of innovation at great good<br>studio and we've had a good fortune of<br>being in business for 12 years working<br>with nonprofits foundations and<br>government and we've been struggling to<br>work at how to run a business in this<br>way since we since working with an cap<br>structure has lots of problems already<br>but then trying to do the work in the<br>design in the social sector adds another<br>layer of complex uh<br>complication we started though our<br>studio with some founding beliefs that<br>are as true today as they were 12 years<br>ago we believe that status quo is<br>unacceptable and that actually might be<br>the biggest thing we're fighting up<br>against the lived experience is<br>expertise and shouldn't be continuously<br>discounted the way it tends to be uh you<br>know we looked at LinkedIn the other day<br>you know I was talking about it you<br>notice that how we talk about all the<br>things we have as credentials that tend<br>to have letters that we then add on the<br>end of and we don't tend to say look<br>I've been living in uh uh edor for um 25<br>years even though that could be your<br>credentials and in many cases that<br>actually is all one should have so to to<br>elevate that um I think is something<br>that we continue toy for and that lasty<br>design is transformative because we<br>think that not only can the work uh<br>change our clients change perhaps<br>processes but actually change us as<br>well so with these finding<br>beliefs We've Ended up working across a<br>whole bunch of different topic areas<br>that have been complicated and<br>longstanding and entrenched and these<br>have taken decades to get to this level<br>of of of of um uh<br>calcification and it would be a naive of<br>us to think that we can somehow solve<br>these in a 16we project on a Gant chart<br>but rather to tackle them with a same<br>longitudinal view as it took for them to<br>get here is probably the way we should<br>be operating meeting with clients who<br>also see the Long View and kind of<br>planning for the marathon and not the<br>Sprint I mean there are things called<br>design Sprints but do you know what I<br>mean like that like thinking about the<br>short as an industry and I know as my<br>training and as a participant in that<br>training I feel like we have been making<br>our industry full of people who are<br>ready to say yes at all times at all<br>costs but really pausing to say no and I<br>think our ability to be able to say yes<br>tends to be almost pavlovian we kind of<br>can't help ourselves as soon as an RFP<br>what the new world that's new to be<br>tender gets on the radar boom people<br>jump into action we can't help it and<br>it's and it's troubling because we go<br>who I can't I'm like being ped like a<br>like a like towards a black hole just<br>rushing into something because we know<br>that we have to say yes in most cases in<br>fact if you think think about how our<br>portfolios are made by Logic they can<br>only be made by saying yes to to many<br>things so to say no would not produce<br>portfolios logically speaking but when<br>practice it seems that perhaps the<br>moments when we are trying to maybe slow<br>things down tends to show up inside us<br>as a quiet little voice our conscience<br>as it were hoping perhaps in some cases<br>even screaming to say like there's<br>something something funny about this<br>about this tender about this RFP<br>something about how this project has<br>been framed and I know that in me when<br>I've had that quiet little voice come up<br>it always came at the wrong time and it<br>would always flare and say are you sure<br>you want to do this and what I would<br>always go sh not now bro like this is<br>not a good time I have a good thing here<br>don't blow it like I'm telling myself<br>and every time it would flare up I go<br>and I would shush it again and again and<br>again again and it started to bother me<br>how used to I used to it I was to<br>shushing the voice that kept flaring up<br>and after working at a large consultancy<br>for about seven years My worry is that I<br>was going to become so numb to the voice<br>that I won't I won't even bother<br>shushing it would just sort of go it<br>would just<br>disappear I'm going to share some<br>examples of the kinds of questions that<br>it would flare up during and I wonder if<br>perhaps you might recognize a few of<br>them I don't think that that these 10<br>questions are that profound per se but<br>just I wonder if you and I could have a<br>recognize what is Design's relationship<br>privilege each of these is a mini<br>lecture by the way or could could become<br>its own course which humans are we<br>designer how do we wean Design's<br>whiteness how can designer say no to<br>work when we need to pay off our student<br>debt medical<br>debt<br>rent designers often sink or swim but<br>why is drowning so common this industry<br>is<br>brutal if it was like a public pool we<br>would have shut it down by now but<br>apparently just it's totally fine no<br>guard rails no life jackets it's just<br>drowning constantly anyway uh why did so<br>how designers decide which people in<br>need to serve there's something very<br>curious about them having to look a<br>certain way they've seen a lot of<br>examples of of designers going like this<br>on their Facebook feeds of bright<br>colored clothes and dark- skinned people<br>weird why does philanthropy not<br>change what's the cost of speaking up<br>and what's the cost if we<br>don't all of these questions are a<br>nightmare I'm sorry they're just awful<br>questions and the last one is a real<br>doozy what right do I have to do this<br>work these questions are the kind that<br>are impossible to answer and are best<br>done over drinks just so you know um but<br>they're the kind that keep you up at<br>night because they tend to be the things<br>that we never talk about I know but I<br>know they rattle around in your heads<br>you may have a variation on these you I<br>have a 10 a whole another 10 that we I<br>love to talk to you about U but I know<br>that these 10 have meant a lot for me<br>because I have shushed every single one<br>of<br>them I I feel like we need space to talk<br>about these because they live in me and<br>I and know I'm concerned that they will<br>loud and it's these kinds of<br>observations about the design industry<br>that I've Had The Good Fortune to be to<br>write about um I've done a little<br>writing I don't identify as a writer but<br>I've had a really good fortune I've had<br>some people respond really well to the<br>writing I've done whether it's around<br>thinking about design education and<br>power whether it's about defining what<br>good means in our industry because I've<br>been invited uh to to judge good design<br>in many in many cases or even talking<br>about the workplace trauma of places<br>I've worked in the past these<br>observations tend to be uh done as<br>almost like an outsider looking at<br>industry and wondering why is it so<br>broken and how can we don't tend to talk<br>about it I'm not trying to like educate<br>people I'm just just want to let people<br>know this is what I've seen and I found<br>a lot of people who perhaps veryy along<br>that spectrum of Readiness or sort of<br>like familiarity with the design I I<br>found a lot of people who are maybe on<br>the lower ends resonate with this more<br>than people who are at this point or<br>maybe a little bit of wor you can tell<br>me later but one of the things that we<br>noticed about this and especially around<br>power is trying to see if we can talk<br>about how that shows up in all our work<br>especially in the social sector and for<br>those who came to the uh gut check<br>Workshop you've seen some of these<br>slides so sorry about that U but to<br>Define power I think it's really helpful<br>to think about how that how this hidden<br>currency shows up in our work all the<br>time now Define it U there are a lot of<br>definitions out in the world but the one<br>that my co-founder gave me is I think<br>one of the most succinct power is the<br>ability to change another person's<br>reality so to think about how you may<br>have received a message maybe on slack<br>or read in the paper or something that<br>says oh my God my entire reality is now<br>different now that might be an<br>indication of how much power that person<br>has over you similarly you may have also<br>sent a text message or a slack message<br>and changed someone else's reality<br>completely and go that might be how much<br>power you have over them so power is<br>this this reality changing aspect and I<br>think it's powerful to talk about it at<br>the scale of one to one person as<br>opposed to at the world leader level<br>because it makes it so<br>abstract alongside thinking about how to<br>to find power it's helpful to think<br>about the the idea of power asymmetry<br>it's this thing that I think I found a<br>little a clearer language for versus the<br>one I've heard which is power dynamics<br>man there was some weird power dynamics<br>in that meeting room and if that's the<br>case I want to kind of like add this<br>additional layer which is a symmetry<br>which is the the observation that power<br>is often lopsided so when you have uh<br>weird power dynamics in a room it might<br>be because there's concentrated power on<br>one end and everybody else is kind of<br>flapping around wondering what's going<br>on so I want to visualize this this<br>phenomena of asymmetry kind of looks<br>like this big fed triangle I made in<br>note not not very sophisticated but I'm<br>going to ask has anyone ever here<br>started a project a design project and<br>from the very first second you go I'm<br>never getting out of life this is so<br>Wackadoo this timeline doesn't make<br>sense this project this this like team<br>doesn't make sense I don't know why is<br>this budget a third of what it should be<br>anybody had that in their career I feel<br>like most of my career spent doing that<br>oh my God if that's the case just to<br>make this visualization feel real that's<br>you on the sharp pointy end of that<br>triangle<br>Le does that work for<br>you so if that's you on the sharoy and<br>there's someone on the wide end pressing<br>down on you making you feel<br>powerless I've had that feeling that<br>that in that feeling of I'm pinned in<br>place many many times I'm incredibly<br>familiar with<br>it so to talk about asymmetric<br>relationships there are plenty of them<br>and I'm going to highlight just a few<br>because I feel like a lot of the world<br>has a symmetry baked into relationships<br>that you interact with and you might<br>find yourself on either one of these two<br>sides throughout the day like I don't<br>think it's fixed but prend somewhat<br>depending upon the roles we play those<br>roles come with certain power and in<br>some cases with very little power so law<br>enforcement with detainees doctors or<br>patients employeers and employees<br>funders the grantees it goes on there's<br>even a certain amount of asymmetry with<br>me and all of you since I'm the only one<br>with the<br>microphone now with the the group on the<br>far right which is the pointy side you<br>would think that we are all about<br>helping those on the right that we will<br>be in alignment with us fight the man<br>right we called create a good Studio<br>don't forget not like conveniently great<br>when we want to be we're called greater<br>good Studio we' made a real stink about<br>it where do you think we actually show<br>up across that spectrum of pointy to<br>work it's awkward to have to explain how<br>far over we are and how awfully chummy<br>we are with those with great<br>power I would love to say we're all<br>about those on the right but actually I<br>just think that that's us being grossly<br>naive we have to be next door hand inand<br>with those with great power to do<br>projects at all as a studio we don't get<br>paid we don't get contracts we don't get<br>relationships we don't get<br>access can you see how this might be a<br>problem here from how I'm arguing at<br>least our alignment with those with<br>great power makes us potentially very<br>right for co-option very right for being<br>providing cover or straight up just<br>being<br>used you would think we could tell but<br>if that was the case then we wouldn't<br>have a jewel cigarette and I wouldn't be<br>on the stage right now I don't know if<br>we know how to tell as a studio sry as a<br>studio or as an industry so our ability<br>to become friends with and get paid by<br>those with great power make us at risk<br>of making things worse for the very<br>people we're supposed to be helping<br>every time we do<br>projects when we work in the shadow of<br>powerway symmetry we become a very<br>useful<br>tool I love this quote here from Alice<br>Walker the most common way people give<br>up their power is by thinking they don't<br>have<br>any that should be we could just leave<br>that up on just say quiet for 30<br>minutes what that reminds me of is that<br>those with great power are constantly at<br>work trying to remind you have none and<br>it only works in their favor that you<br>believe it so when we say look we can't<br>change things things are too difficult<br>it's true they are difficult but it<br>always works in the fam when we shed the<br>power the little power we have and as a<br>design team we I think it's worth our<br>time trying to work out how can we<br>Leverage The Little Bits we have because<br>sometimes we might end up with a bunch<br>we don't<br>understand so in order for us to kind of<br>figure out kind of how do we wield this<br>power with care we try to do this gut<br>check there's morning's uh exercise this<br>Workshop we ran was really fun because<br>it helped us helped others build their<br>own rubrics and the rubric we have at<br>our studio now is about version five and<br>we've done a bunch of them to try to<br>evaluate the very nature of those<br>questions that we come across the ones<br>that we get invited<br>to and and here's the thing we found<br>across the social sector man not every<br>question warrants an answer as it not<br>every RFP needs a proposal not every<br>tender needs a response you've seen some<br>really downright stupid tenders I'm sure<br>like why are we why is this even exist<br>perhaps not responding might be might<br>message and while I'm very proud of the<br>portfolio we have as a studio we have a<br>good record now we have an interesting<br>record of about 50 breakup emails where<br>we say it's not you it's me and we've<br>done about 50 of those over the last 12<br>years with the largest single breakup<br>resulting in a $2 million loss for us as<br>a studio from usaid which is the federal<br>us Federal government's International<br>Agency on on International Development<br>and then this thing the 150 gut checks<br>is where we've run through the process<br>of evaluating incoming projects many<br>many many many times to work out what is<br>our not really like is it a yes or no<br>but rather what is our sensitivity to<br>projects in fact this is the very first<br>breakup IMA I ever sent uh this one took<br>me eight hours to write because I was so<br>terrified of upsetting people<br>and there was an internal struggle<br>actually working out in my head of<br>actually not just um can I send it but<br>there's real identity question like who<br>the hell do I think I am to send this<br>like it was really<br>stressful but it turns out that the<br>underlying structure behind this looks<br>like this and I've written emails like<br>this many many times since so i' love to<br>share this photo because if you could<br>maybe take a picture now because you<br>might want to write a breakup Emil at<br>some point in your in your career and i'<br>take for you to spend eight hours<br>wasting time trying to figure it out<br>just use use this format so you start<br>with a thank you because it's nice to be<br>asked say no right up front don't put it<br>at the end like PS I'm breaking up say<br>it's not you it's me and then give your<br>justification and then lastly when he<br>says let's stay friends remind people<br>hey we're probably going to run into<br>each other because they will never<br>forget<br>you breaking up is very rare the<br>justification part I think is the bit<br>that most people avoid and we use<br>obfuscating language things like we<br>don't have<br>capacity well it's not not a good<br>culture fit very convenient but I do<br>think if you could spend the time to<br>work out what exactly about this doesn't<br>work helps you yourself understand and<br>kind of like make Clarity around the<br>them so I'm going to try and see if we<br>can bring this<br>back I have a bit of a dim view of the<br>design industry having been in it for a<br>while and I would say that without<br>deliberate intervention design rarely<br>serves<br>Society it isn't really built for it<br>but in order to do so if you trust<br>others to do this work we I'd like to<br>see what interventions have you already<br>designed because it needs to be tripped<br>up because it will Barrel towards an<br>outcome otherwise on its<br>own and that for a long time at least<br>the last 10 years I remember coming up<br>in the industry we kept hearing about<br>design leadership wanting to get a seat<br>at the table do you guys remember this I<br>want to see at the table like like<br>little whiny toddlers I want to see at<br>the table cuz we kept trying to go<br>through this thing called design a scale<br>we want see sweet designers we have got<br>that now we are good and in the pursuit<br>to try to get design at<br>scale we have ended up causing harmer<br>pause I say that in that root of the<br>design industry as we've been teaching<br>it and and practicing it designed those<br>two things particularly<br>well building capital is the one that<br>probably most people recognize it for<br>that's the one I know but it also has<br>this comes along with another component<br>which I think is worth describing it<br>helps people seek<br>Comfort it is a it's an affordance for<br>folks who are looking to become<br>comfortable who do you think is most<br>interested in building capital and<br>seeking<br>Comfort the most<br>powerful they think it's their right to<br>build capital and to be made<br>comfortable which makes design an very<br>attractive Target for the most powerful<br>to say come along for the<br>ride and I would argue at this point<br>that really design is become an<br>accelerant it will is like Rocket Fuel<br>to almost anything is attached to and I<br>want us to try to see if we can check<br>train and sadly I say that maybe pretty<br>much every major brand that exists on<br>your phone that exists on the world has<br>been brought to you by Design on purpose<br>and there are teams working 24 hours 24<br>hours a day actively trying to get you<br>to pay attention to them and they're<br>constantly and at this point I say<br>design leadership is being willfully<br>ignorant or either grossly naive to<br>pretend it's not<br>happening when we graduate students from<br>universities just like this where are we<br>send them<br>to and what role will they play if we<br>aren't if we aren't providing the with<br>some structure around how did<br>they Define their boundaries they will<br>steamrolled but what if saying no wasn't<br>a personal preference wasn't about sort<br>of like appearing to be whiny because<br>this talk is so depressing I want to try<br>see if I can kind of Bring it on<br>something a little lighter what if<br>perhaps it was something a little bigger<br>than sort of just saying I don't want to<br>what if instead we had something a<br>little larger than any one individual<br>the system of accountability the things<br>that we have in really every other major<br>profession that we know of our peers as<br>it were a code of ethics standards for<br>practice licensing and accreditation<br>continued education and more there are<br>other professions who call themselves<br>professions and get to because they have<br>these elements and that as a design<br>industry we we could be dismissed as a<br>trade and not the profession we claim to<br>be when we still have these things<br>absent in our in our<br>practice<br>now the licensing and accreditation<br>could be a little troubling for some<br>because I know that in this room there<br>are people who have already been stopped<br>and gatee kept on their progression to<br>because on their way to becoming a<br>designer I've suddenly have felt that<br>I'm not asking for more gatekeeping I'm<br>just asking for more accountability<br>which I think is a little different and<br>I would say that as is as this continues<br>we might start to see an interesting<br>bation in our industry those who are<br>willing to work with an accountable<br>framework and be paid for that work from<br>clients who are willing to pay for<br>accountability and then there will be<br>everybody else continuing as they as<br>they<br>are my hope is that that accountability<br>that accountable group get become a<br>larger and larger<br>set and I think that we can actually see<br>glimpses of what that might look like by<br>peeking into the future and I want to<br>share with you a database that we've<br>been maintaining at the studio for the<br>last several years uh some of you might<br>want to take<br>this uh address<br>down uh it's a really fascinating<br>document because it exists on the<br>internet of around almost 300 design<br>organizations that have been doing<br>design differently but I think because<br>all of them have worked at other Design<br>Studios and are hoping to see if we can<br>do it differently themselves we are on<br>the studio of course and there are many<br>others in this room that they also on<br>well uh some of the stats we have a lot<br>in North America we have a lot of<br>consultancies uh we have a lot of<br>organizations under 10 people<br>uh and even the leadership makeup looks<br>again very differently than than I think<br>we'd seen design leadership in the<br>past here's that link again my hope is<br>that you can take a look Be<br>Inspired you may find that there are<br>organizations you know of personally<br>that I don't so you should add them and<br>submit them to here which would be great<br>and my dream dream is you go I see a gap<br>I'm going to just add myself because I<br>think I should run out my I have it I<br>should just run a studio and you can<br>start yourself and add it to the list<br>because this list I think could be a<br>place where people can look to as a<br>changes I think if we were to do that in<br>introspective work we might get closer<br>to the rhetoric we tell ourselves and<br>tell tell the world around what design<br>could do instead of just building<br>capital I think we actually have the<br>potential to build power and instead of<br>just seeking Comfort I think we have the<br>opportunity to help seek truth design is<br>good at doing both of these things<br>building power silking<br>truth that that will attract a very<br>different kind of clientele than the one<br>that currently is interested in capital<br>and<br>comfort if we pursue these goals I think<br>we might end up with a very different<br>set of clients in a very different<br>industry marketly different than how<br>gone I think we have everything we need<br>we're actually training people in this<br>complexity we have training people to to<br>find path patterns from complex things<br>and their design interventions kind of<br>what our job is we're really good at<br>this and I think we can do so if we were<br>just slow down and listen to that quiet<br>little voice inside all of<br>us thank you very<br>much I invite you to have a seat here<br>please<br>okay um thank you for that<br>very reflect U insightful and foot for<br>the mind and the thought and the heart<br>for everyone so now I want to introduce<br>our panelist and we will continue with a<br>panel so first we have uh Kini tewa napi<br>terwa he's a director design director<br>ACC Curative a creative agency inspiring<br>social change an award-winning designer<br>who loves to work deeply with<br>communities to honor their realities and<br>perspectives<br>K's skill at translating project needs<br>into richly layer creative work and his<br>connection with M language values and<br>practice has been instrumental in<br>changing Curative ways of<br>working beyond the studio can has always<br>been committed to ning Oakland's<br>communities volunteering organizations<br>such as design assembly creative<br>mornings Oakland and most recently in<br>the role of co-chair of Oakland Pride F<br>Festival<br>also we have Cecilia fuina Cecilia fuina<br>started off in audiovisual design<br>production straight out of aut in<br>the90s practicing design had a different<br>meaning for her in comparison to what<br>she was doing in her work so she left<br>and trained as a teacher as a teacher<br>for secondary school<br>instead in education Cecilia found her<br>calling in facilitating art design and<br>Technology lessons here she was able to<br>to combine her love for creativity and<br>be of service to others in the<br>community Cecil is conscious of the many<br>challenges we face in today's world and<br>is constantly looking for better ways to<br>inform Empower uplift and prepare people<br>for complex situations using creativity<br>her most recent practice position FAA<br>the Tongan idea of creative skill<br>especially in performance and five ba<br>the San idea of nuring relational spaces<br>as a way for young people in particular<br>to create and express themselves for<br>better wellbeing so please applause<br>applause<br>and and I forgot to introduce myself I<br>will be sitting here my name is oh thank<br>you um yeah my name is Diana alvaran<br>Gonzalez I am a lecturer here um and the<br>design programs in weat mat and I have<br>the pleasure to moderate tonight's<br>session so I will be just reading the<br>questions and facilitating the<br>conversation but I will save the talking<br>for me just to have the space for<br>them<br>um so the first question after what we<br>saw um in the talk the first question is<br>for K and<br>Cecilia so from your P your perspective<br>as Tangen<br>and Pacifica what are your views and<br>experiences in Social<br>design in aloa what makes it unique to<br>places uh K and thank you for uh the<br>welcome and thank you to George for the<br>talk it's really compelling um lots of<br>really uh meaty questions for us to to<br>think<br>about<br>um uh we were kind of Talking georgean<br>George came to the studio for lunch<br>today we're were talking about this a<br>little bit I think as Marty uh in alter<br>um there's a lot of alignment with the<br>codesign process there's um a valuing of<br>um Collective knowledge and Collective<br>decision- making and<br>um so we so I think that informs a lot<br>of the process that we do and the<br>importance of process um the valuing of<br>sure the valuing of uh um f is really<br>important relationship building and when<br>you build<br>relationships deeply um you feel a<br>responsibility and that accountability<br>that you mentioned to the communities<br>that you work for for um and that it<br>goes across a lot of the projects most<br>well every project that we do um we feel<br>a responsibility to the communities that<br>we are working for and alongside not to<br>the people that are funding the project<br>um and so we're quite comfortable um<br>holding that uh sovereignty um again a a<br>key principle of<br>Mii uh is sovereignty of man M um and<br>being able to hold firm to that and say<br>we don't think what you're suggesting is<br>right I think this is better this<br>because this is what the community has<br>told us um being values Le and uh<br>valuing and centering Des centering our<br>own kind of acknowledging the power that<br>we have decentering it and allowing as<br>much power as we um Can channel to the<br>communities that we're working for is uh<br>key and the responsibility that I feel<br>as mildy to represent those community<br>um and some of the other values that uh<br>all of this kind of is within our<br>founding<br>document of and<br>um the Declaration of Independence we<br>have guidance already we have a document<br>that says we must uh create opportun<br>opportunities to partner with our<br>communities to ensure that there is<br>participation at every level and uh<br>protection of the Tong of our our people<br>and in that document It Centers Marty<br>experience yes<br>but every every Mar community that we<br>talk to about this also makes room for<br>diverse perspectives for the for those<br>that our migrant uh well our Pacific um<br>tangana cousins there's a special<br>relationship there<br>um uh our M those that migrate to us<br>yours our queer Foo our disability<br>communities there's so much our Refugee<br>communities there's so much diversity<br>and intersectionality to consider there<br>and um a socialist lens a collectivist<br>lens really centers that and creates<br>accountability for us so I think that<br>kind of the process in general doesn't<br>change or differ too much from what<br>George was talking about but the<br>responsibilities um that we feel the<br>accountability that we feel um really<br>Echoes through the foundational document<br>place K everyone uh thank you for this<br>opportunity um thank you George thank<br>you k andiana um so from a Pacific<br>lens um and that's quite an interesting<br>lens because being Pacific I can't speak<br>for all Pacific<br>um so there's so many islands that make<br>up<br>Oceana and<br>so already I you know am set apart<br>somehow and then even though uh my<br>mother is tongen my father is Salon um<br>I'm first generation um Islander brought<br>up here in New Zealand so again um<br>another world uh you know world view<br>that's quite set apart but really<br>grateful that we have uh tangua here<br>that we can um I feel empowered as a<br>Pacific Islander because they give us<br>permission to draw<br>on our World<br>Views um so I feel in Altera um we're<br>becoming more and more accepting of uh<br>the these indigenous World viws which is<br>awesome<br>um I haven't been to other places to<br>know what they do there but uh what I<br>know to be true from my upbringing or<br>from my culture is um if you H if you<br>yeah okay uh the second question goes to<br>George So based on your recent<br>experience in<br>Australia and your vast experience in<br>the US and other places what do you<br>differences um I've been so fortunate to<br>uh have worked in practice in uh in the<br>US now um and I've seen a growing change<br>of clients who are ready and that's been<br>wonderful um but I think that one of the<br>remarkable things having come over here<br>is just how ready everybody else is not<br>just clients but the community the<br>design practitioners I feel like<br>everyone's so ready here that I was<br>mentioning at at the lunch I feel like I<br>kind of stepped into the future from<br>where I am right now in the United<br>States and I think that that to me feels<br>a little bit um I I have to assume uh<br>that perhaps the familiarity and and and<br>uh the power that indigenous Voice have<br>here is part of what that makes that<br>feel as though it's more advanced um and<br>ready<br>we are miles away from where you guys<br>are in terms of of sovereignty uh<br>conversation around reparations uh for<br>um even the African-Americans we have in<br>our in the United States is decades away<br>uh and then the kind of landback<br>movement within the United States is<br>probably for the decades again behind um<br>while there are um uh indigenous<br>practitioners of design I'm still not<br>that close to them um and I think this<br>for me this is one of the most<br>remarkable parts of this trip is trying<br>to see if I can get into greater<br>proximity with those who are practicing<br>and are connected to the land here both<br>in Australia and in in New Zealand so<br>I'm very excited about what I'm seeing<br>um I have a crush if that seems like a<br>weird thing to say like a professional<br>Crush across the region and I'm hoping<br>to learn as much as I can while being uh<br>here but I also think I can't get that<br>far through Linkedin and and and zoom so<br>there's a real limit to that so my hope<br>is by being simply closer I can start<br>relationships that are harder to do and<br>you know like a series of<br>domino pieces can start those<br>conversations that perhaps will Le to um<br>way okay the next the next question is<br>to KH um how do you navigate the<br>difference in World Views between<br>mainstream Western approaches in design<br>and<br>YouTu uh I really love this question um<br>and I kind of love the provocation that<br>you had George<br>around uh decolonizing design or how do<br>we um I don't know I can't remember how<br>exactly you you put it but like how do<br>we um stop looking it uh or privileging<br>white um Western design um it's<br>something that uh actually when I first<br>came back to New Zealand before Curative<br>was a thing and Jade was talking to me<br>about like my career um she encouraged<br>me to to lean into my mar identity and<br>um I really took that to heart and um so<br>thank you Jade for encouraging me to to<br>to do that to embrace my um my Papa<br>um I think it's<br>fairly easy for I I want to acknowledge<br>that I live and work within a bubble of<br>people that are on the on the Walker um<br>like they're fully committed to and<br>believe in um<br>man and uh they learn about our treaty<br>obligations and what T treaty<br>is um and a lot of our clients that we<br>engage with also believe that so I'm<br>able to hold my ground and we as a<br>studio are able to hold our ground a lot<br>more than I think is true of the wider<br>industry but being Val so values LED and<br>saying upfront that this is what we<br>believe in we believe in uh being led by<br>T we believe our values as an agency are<br>that we um believe people are the<br>experts that lived experience is<br>important that um the communities that<br>we learn walk alongside deserve to be<br>valued for the the perspectives that<br>they have that they deserve to be<br>nourished and um like we talk a lot<br>about um um the outcomes of our project<br>the impacts of our projects how we<br>always question how are we building uh<br>capacity into the Comm those communities<br>how are we building capability into<br>those<br>communities um earlier today uh at over<br>lunch we were talking about a framework<br>that we use uh for most of Curative<br>lifespan um we did the gut check though<br>we we had the questions about what<br>projects we would take on and and what<br>we wouldn't and that was fairly<br>intuitive for most of its time um and<br>from its founding we said we would only<br>take on projects that were that was<br>creating good for our communities for<br>our people so that's a fairly clear line<br>but we didn't um formalize it we didn't<br>put it down onto paper what the<br>decision- making process was until uh<br>the last couple years where we were<br>really focused on welcoming people into<br>that process and um putting down onto<br>the paper how we make that decisions<br>what kind of questions we ask and it's<br>essentially the questions that um George<br>put up onto the to the the screen<br>earlier those those 10 hard questions<br>guide who the way that we engage with<br>projects um<br>and when it comes to Mar and M um<br>process to TI um that is how we hold<br>that's how<br>we uh hold true to those values that's<br>how we Center those values first um<br>having a framework to work within that<br>protect us from um uh mainstream Western<br>biases um now to<br>Sicilia how do you navigate the<br>difference in worldviews between same<br>like mainstream approaches and Pacific<br>approaches especially knowing the type<br>of Mahi you did for your people PhD that<br>it was so grounded in in as described in<br>perspectives k for the<br>um okay<br>so I guess for me when<br>creating um especially if it's to serve<br>my people or the people that I come<br>across um so for me I was a teacher for<br>20 years<br>and um for me teaching is service it's<br>um you're there to serve the kids<br>so thinking about<br>that um I drew on my salmon and Tong<br>culture a lot um because my father was<br>always his thing was if you're<br>if you're going to be in these positions<br>um you're there to serve and um if<br>you're going to serve then you should<br>know the people you are serving so um<br>even like in teaching I did that in a<br>weird way as<br>well um so I left I left um<br>I had to advertise for rothman's and for<br>Lon<br>breweries and<br>um in statistics MDI and Pacific<br>Islanders are right up there right so of<br>course I didn't want to adverti for that<br>um so that's why I went into<br>teaching but then in teaching um I I<br>used to take the after school kids um I<br>don't know is anyone here an<br>extracurricular particular kid who<br>stayed after school and did Rock Band<br>and all of that stuff yeah well I I used<br>to look after those students so um these<br>students<br>were like kind of like the the<br>rebellious kids in the school um and I<br>just thought actually they do some<br>awesome work in here I don't know what<br>the problem is so uh I used to take them<br>to<br>festivals and um to<br>you know uh rock band competitions<br>things like that and um I actually wrote<br>a poem about it can I share the PO okay<br>so I took these students to<br>polyest which is as you know it's a<br>competition that happens here in Oakland<br>where all maldi and Pacifica students<br>will showcase what they've learned<br>throughout the year um and the school<br>that I taught at they weren't happy with<br>me taking these students so this is the<br>response I teach in spaces because of<br>opportunities my parents gifted Me<br>growing<br>Up When students flow through school<br>Gates some look like me many years ago<br>being dropped off by a parent sleep<br>deprived and irritable from working<br>night shifts to make in<br>meet I take these kids to concerts<br>competitions and<br>festivals glorified picnics my<br>colleagues call<br>them but I take them so that these<br>students can hear their stories being<br>told through poetry sound and dance from<br>cultures less bleached given voice proud<br>and Roar in the<br>world these are the kids who join<br>extracurricular groups the ones who<br>strive to find something deeper creating<br>from the center of their<br>lives favor<br>favor woven as fine mats beaten as n<br>knocked together into harmonies<br>sustained by kapahaka Rock Quest Church<br>choirs family gatherings and Cava<br>ceremonies voices finding<br>connection creative Misfits plastic<br>Polynesians<br>aasis kids from in between but belonging<br>other<br>so so for me I shared that with my<br>students don't know why I thought that<br>would be a good<br>idea um but then the students shared<br>their experiences about about what it's<br>like not fitting in at<br>school um and so from these stories I<br>began to understand these students a<br>whole lot more<br>um and then we put our works together to<br>put on the School<br>production um the principal came to see<br>the school<br>production and it was a mix of my poems<br>the student poems and they had rallied<br>up 50 other kids to be the actors and<br>actresses<br>so in doing this like I guess um for the<br>principal it was a new way of doing<br>things we weren't doing Shakespeare but<br>we were still learning we were still<br>doing<br>English um but it was them<br>speaking from their point of view and<br>still using those skills that they had<br>to learn um at school so for me<br>uh the difference<br>between um a Moana Oceanic perspective<br>versus a western perspective is<br>immersing yourself into the culture that<br>operate thank you um<br>so this one is for George in same<br>alignment um in your work you're talking<br>about human Center design mostly in the<br>studio and stuff but you work with a<br>great variety of people and Community<br>with very diverse cultural backgrounds<br>and including your own background so how<br>do you navigate this in order to<br>everyone to be heard or meaningfully<br>integrated<br>I think one of the challenges of doing<br>that kind of work is doing a lot of<br>internal work ahead of time and I think<br>what was challenging for me was not<br>recognizing that there was anything<br>there to to salvage uh I spent a lot of<br>time growing up in England feeling very<br>much like I was trying to fit in as an<br>English person doing everything I<br>possibly could which included losing a<br>lot of my<br>Burmese culture and and background<br>shedding it as quickly as possible and<br>it's left me feeling very raw now<br>because I feel as though I got cheated<br>out of that exchange because if it<br>didn't become more English I'm never<br>going to fit in I'm never going to make<br>it and now at the end of many years I<br>feel like that was a shitty shitty uh<br>deal um and that now trying to reclaim<br>it I make for I get very nervous<br>thinking about my Burmese Heritage<br>because I don't think I'm ever going to<br>be burmes enough or Asian enough so I<br>have a whole bunch of new new issues to<br>have to work myself through but the idea<br>that perhaps I was less than is now<br>being replaced with with what I have is<br>enough and what I would love to help<br>students through particularly but also<br>most communities that we work with is<br>that please don't pretend as though<br>there's anything deficit here you're<br>good and if anything what you have was<br>not only enough is we're celebrating is<br>what we is what we want to hold on to<br>and that intuitively you have levels of<br>creativity that we have silenced ignored<br>or obliterated so when we work with<br>clients and communities we're trying to<br>work out how do we hold obey all the<br>nonsense that people have said about you<br>and just let you be as you are and what<br>that means is that we have to design<br>engagements that can allow for autonomy<br>and and uh care and self<br>self-determination without it becoming a<br>burden this is something we talked about<br>at lunch like what is the fine line<br>between designing spaces for people to<br>do design work even if they wouldn't use<br>that language without it becoming a<br>whole another job on top of the job of<br>just living your life like that's I<br>think a careful balance but if we also<br>don't make those opportunities be real<br>um then I think we end up doing the more<br>surface level like an it it's like<br>taking a survey but with more steps<br>that's the version I know that we could<br>do that I think would probably for many<br>clients probably be great they'd be<br>thrilled that there's been some<br>co-creation or some co co co- something<br>almost almost don't I don't know if they<br>care some Co something and it's like<br>well okay well what does that really<br>look like and actually what it comes<br>down to in many cases is what is the<br>real decision- making power I don't<br>think many clients actually saying they<br>want to give up all their decision-<br>making for another group but I think<br>actually sometimes we we can imagine<br>that they did or we think we read<br>between the lines of an RFP and go oh I<br>think they really want codes design and<br>full autonomy and then we find out once<br>we do the project that they never meant<br>that then that's a real shock so I think<br>it behooves us if we get into these<br>engagements where autonomy is the goal<br>actually working out what are the real<br>ground rules here what are people really<br>signing up for because again if we work<br>in the shadow face symmetry we really<br>need to know what are they what are they<br>willing to agree to so one things that<br>we one one of the few things we do up<br>front even before we get into a gut<br>check is actually have a conversation<br>with those potential clients in the<br>first 60 minutes and<br>say knowing how good our team is at<br>doing research we will get to insights<br>that might not just uh be really<br>revealing and it might not just say hey<br>your community might not what you want<br>might not want what you have to offer we<br>might actually realize that you are<br>implicated by this research that you<br>have been part of the problem the whole<br>time how do you plan on handling that<br>how do you hand on not just you but your<br>clients handling that Revelation because<br>it's probably going to come up and that<br>splits our clients in half one group say<br>hell no that is the L what are you<br>talking about why would you make it more<br>complicated bro just like do the thing<br>you know what I mean right there's a<br>group that's like just stop making it<br>harder and then another group they'll<br>say I didn't even know we could get that<br>is that a thing like we can get that I<br>said yeah I said let's have that don't<br>worry about the RFP like put that aside<br>let's do this and it's mindblowing for<br>them because they go W I didn't know we<br>could even get to that level of depth I<br>said in those cases I go I feel like<br>okay we find our people and what what it<br>what it helps us do is if we want to<br>have that level of autonomy and<br>decision- making we talked about I think<br>it's on us to work out what are the<br>ground rules who who are we really<br>working with and what is their tolerance<br>for change because that actually ends up<br>being some of the biggest condition<br>setting for whether or not projects<br>really happen we can do the project all<br>day long we can write the we can do the<br>proposal we can do all the the phases<br>and nothing<br>changes some of it should have been seen<br>ahead of time because no one was<br>actually ready or if you can identify<br>that ahead of time we will do whatever<br>it takes usually to try and get that<br>project to happen because they're very<br>rare<br>so that condition identification I think<br>job thank<br>you um I think you just answer my<br>question now so I will ask no no it's<br>great so I will ask that to come and<br>Cecilia<br>um because we have been talking about<br>you know like the the power Symmetry and<br>in Social designning like who commission<br>it and if it's private if it's public or<br>even in academic institutions as<br>well<br>um so could you share an<br>experience or something that you have in<br>symmetry um yeah I I think we uh ACC<br>cretive are very aware of that and I<br>want to acknowledge that um it is who is<br>the director of the agency um is to uh I<br>think one of the points that you<br>made very aware and actively working to<br>deconstruct that um Power and balance um<br>and is unlocks a lot of our ability to<br>say no to clients as the the person who<br>is responsible for the financial<br>decisions that impact the agency um she<br>is<br>the point that is able to say no we<br>won't do that or we don't think this is<br>the right thing for you to do so we can<br>stand up to clients who are asking for<br>things that we don't think are right um<br>and that's hugely empowering for us as<br>an agency and for us to address and<br>really kind of dig into the the social<br>issues that we are trying to um<br>deconstruct um and we have an A pretty<br>recent example of that um where we<br>engaged with a tender or RFP um and went<br>through when we do one of these um rfps<br>or attenders we are upfront with our<br>process and we very rarely will do a<br>creative pitch we will go in with our<br>process and say we can't tell you what<br>the answer is going to be because we<br>haven't done a process we haven't talked<br>to the communities that you want us to<br>to work for um so until we do that we<br>can't give you an answer we can maybe<br>have assumptions but I don't think<br>that's helpful to share at this point um<br>and by doing that often is act as a no<br>um to to clients if they're not happy<br>with that process or or if they want to<br>clear a product then they will walk away<br>and choose somebody else and that's cool<br>um but sometimes we do get clients who<br>say yes we uh believe in honoring TTI we<br>have like within Curative we have a<br>Marty Ru who uh act as a gut check as<br>well um and we have named as a need for<br>us when we're engaging with our clients<br>to understand where they are at on their<br>Journey with T3 their understanding of<br>3 and also how important it is for us to<br>meet with their Marty staff so we get a<br>a clear understanding of what their<br>honoring of the T3 looks like<br>and the creating of space for um those<br>that Community or if it's a different<br>community that we're working for making<br>connections with those the the<br>representation within that Community<br>within that the client's um<br>staff um and by doing that we get a<br>understanding of what they're doing<br>internally how it turns up shows up in<br>their work and we can make<br>decisions uh for the Project based<br>around that um some times that doesn't<br>always um turn out to be as accurate as<br>we would like um and if that happens<br>then we are happy to be hold them to<br>account hold the client to account and<br>say you know this wasn't cool and this<br>is why it wasn't cool um so being able<br>to be honest with them as much as<br>possible without fear of um<br>retribution trusting like I talked about<br>uh forong up the<br>front building a relationship at front<br>and then trusting that relationship to<br>see you through hard conversations is<br>essential because hard conversations are<br>often essential to create social<br>change<br>um that was kind of not a specific<br>example but many kind of Engagement<br>relationship<br>examples<br>um I want to add one more thing uh<br>specific example that I can talk to<br>actually is related to uh vaping High<br>minimization campaign for for that is in<br>Market at the moment in play at the<br>moment um and one of the ways that we uh<br>addressed imbalance there power and<br>balance was to um treat the co-designers<br>the young people that we engaged to do<br>the work of insight Gathering we treated<br>them like employees we paid them a a<br>wage um and we gave them very clear job<br>descriptions and then they went out and<br>did the work and came back with um the<br>insights and at the end of it we at the<br>end of the process we gathered them all<br>together and had a whole H whole W where<br>we um again valued their perspectives<br>and we've continued to share back the<br>work that has been done the the work<br>that the suggestions and to check that<br>it's okay with them so we're we're<br>keeping them engaged all the way through<br>even to the point of being featured in<br>The Campaign itself a lot of theah here<br>who formed the codesign group which we<br>call ha the ha Collective ha means<br>breath and T Al Marti um so it's a<br>leaning into the metaphorical space um<br>and the the sacredness of breath um<br>we're featured in that are featured in<br>that vaping har minimization campaign so<br>um yeah it's just finding every<br>opportunity to create nourishing<br>experiences to build uh Pathways for our<br>communities to elevate their own<br>perspectives still<br>thinking that was<br>cool<br>um<br>that power and balance um okay so for me<br>one of one of my jobs one time was to<br>um go out into uh mental health spaces<br>uh people who were providing services<br>for people with mental health issues um<br>and give a Pacific point of<br>view um but I only had an hour a week to<br>be able to do that um so of course<br>that's not<br>possible um you want me to go and run<br>these workshops with people I don't know<br>them they don't know me so how am I<br>going to get their responses about<br>what's good for mental health<br>um so I took myself off that job um<br>and that's what led me to looking at<br>mental health from uh young people's<br>perspectives which I then took into<br>teaching<br>um operating from a<br>western perspective is quite difficult<br>because I feel responsible to my<br>ancestors before<br>me and<br>so I know if they think it sucks and<br>they'll tell me cuz you know that little<br>small voice right um then then an a wres<br>like I I've got to change um tactic so<br>that's that's kind of a thing um I think<br>it's I use it from my tongue and<br>perspective and I'm a bit like George<br>rare I feel quite plastic like I'm<br>trying to learn my culture um because I<br>grew up here and of course I didn't grow<br>Up In traditional ways and so a lot of<br>my students are like that they don't<br>know traditional ways so we were all<br>trying to learn it together and we found<br>that a lot of our mental health issues<br>came from that not<br>belonging<br>um<br>so what we decided to do together was<br>learn traditional things together um and<br>so I wasn't the<br>expert um and neither were they we were<br>all teaching each other things just like<br>in my design class I didn't know how to<br>3D print some students were teaching me<br>that and I taught them technical drawing<br>which is the old school stuff you know<br>um and so for for me like that's how I<br>navigate the space is um looking more at<br>the we how can we work together<br>rather than I find I struggle a lot if I<br>yeah thank you so jumping into the last<br>question and so to close in an<br>optimistic and hopeful way um if you can<br>make a wish and create an impactful<br>change in<br>be<br>I wasn't quite ready for that one um<br>that's<br>good um I would like there to<br>be just an acknowledgement of just how<br>intuitive this practice is and less<br>pressure around it being formally<br>trained and and to rack up so many hours<br>in in technical skills as the only way<br>in which you get to be called a designer<br>and I want to get to a point whereby we<br>have legitimate design credentials just<br>from being living in today's world and I<br>think sometimes the uh the the<br>demarcation of design or or designer or<br>not uh is a internal identity struggle<br>I've had for years and I think I've<br>wasted a lot of time with that type of<br>tension um I can do a pretty good<br>impression of one though so I play one<br>on TV as it were but I think there are a<br>lot of people who are in community doing<br>their own design work for themselves<br>that doesn't get a lot of<br>acknowledgement uh that I think could be<br>could be counted towards the credentials<br>that we that we lord certain designers<br>with and I think if we could see that be<br>acknowledged and recognized and<br>celebrated uh we might recognize that<br>actually the term designer doesn't have<br>precious um yeah this this is a hard one<br>um uh I think a lot of my initial<br>reactions were based on the kind of idea<br>that George shared about having a code<br>of ethics for the um<br>industry which I really struggled to get<br>my head hit around because I think a lot<br>of the I agree<br>ethics uh guide a lot of what C Curative<br>does and how we<br>operate um but the ethics of the design<br>industry are tied so intrinsically with<br>capitalism so without deconstructing<br>capitalism how do we introduce those<br>ethics um um and that's why I'm<br>like uh my ways of being to Mar is great<br>because that's socialism that's<br>collectivism that's uh social<br>responsibility um that's a<br>responsibility to The Wider community<br>and to your local community as well it<br>scales all the way down to the<br>neighborhood that you live in and all<br>the way up to the larger population um<br>and so maybe my answer is socialism<br>a solid answer but um more like<br>concretely I I think it what would be<br>really great if the designers like<br>understanding one what a designer is and<br>two teaching designers as they come up<br>to understand what the impact of their<br>work is not just to like put stuff out<br>into the world without consider really<br>considering the audience and um doing<br>what work to understand the cultural<br>context of the place that you are<br>working in we did at at Uni at a all<br>those years ago a paper on the Z class<br>but it was focused on the history of the<br>place it wasn't focused on the cultural<br>context of now and all of the the<br>diverse communities make up up that make<br>up Alo until we understand as a<br>people what a m Community<br>is I mean you can't it's so diverse but<br>until you understand that diversity and<br>celebrate that diversity and are willing<br>to work towards understanding the needs<br>of the most at risk parts of the<br>community and work to to up to elevate<br>and to support those parts then we're<br>design okay still thinking um<br>if I was to be really optimistic um I<br>think that idea of having ethics like we<br>learn more about ethics in our undergrad<br>would be<br>awesome um because I don't think I ever<br>learned that in undergrad<br>um and just like we have um work<br>experience right where you go down go<br>around and do an internship but wouldn't<br>it be cool if you actually went into a<br>community<br>um and sort of have firsthand experience<br>how to do<br>that<br>um yeah I again okay again I'm drawing<br>from from a cultural perspective like so<br>um when I design or when when Pacific<br>people design um<br>if we have this thing called AI or um<br>ma like warmth um and so I don't know if<br>you've ever been to a Pacific island<br>performance and like people are<br>performing and then people in the<br>audience will join in people behind you<br>will join in that's what we call Ma and<br>so um if design is good everybody feels<br>it<br>o well<br>um speechless now so I think we can<br>close and if I can like thank you very<br>much for your like wonderful<br>Coro and um yeah if we can have the<br>panelists<br>and I invite um yep ah well first uh<br>Angus will give you in the name of<br>us yeah it's just a little koha from<br>from our school to our um panelist thank<br>you very much for this wonderful cord<br>all<br>um yeah<br>I'm personally very like yeah I've been<br>very sick these past few days but it's<br>like I'm I'm pulling this through like I<br>won't miss this for the world because it<br>this been amazing it's such a pleasure<br>and an honor to be part of at least just<br>reading the questions um but yeah there<br>there's a lot of Reflections that I<br>invite you everyone to take in and just<br>sit down and think this through a little<br>bit<br>more um as George uh says with a gut G<br>check but I also invite you to use your<br>heart and the AI<br>MAF so um yeah we will close with the<br>you Diana and thank you for holding us<br>tonight um just to release us back into<br>our daily lives um into to rest uh all<br>of the heavy discussion allow it all to<br>rest<br>um</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
