have<br>in science and in biological disciplines<br>in general<br>why are we violent and when we are we<br>violent what are the causes of violence<br>and what are the consequences and I'm<br>trying to do that from different angles<br>because as I will show you in a moment<br>it's very important to have across the<br>Seminary approach<br>these questions have been addressed and<br>tried to answer for centuries from<br>philosophers scientists artists and and<br>researchers in many different<br>disciplines but also have also caused a<br>number of debates and and arguments<br>about the causes of violence and what<br>type of methodological approaches or<br>theoretical approaches should best<br>explain the occurrence of violence<br>and you have some examples here of some<br>quotes from very uh important<br>researchers or philosophers who have<br>tried to address the topic and also a<br>sample of books these are all excellent<br>books but you can see by reading these<br>quotes so that there is a lot of<br>discussion over the causes of violence<br>war in particular because war of course<br>is the most uh<br>dramatic or or<br>um<br>evident form of violence that we have in<br>humans<br>so there are quotes from Alfred Tennyson<br>who describe nature as a read read in<br>tooth and Claw because his argument was<br>that animals are constantly fighting<br>with one another in order to survive and<br>reproduce but then you have on the Other<br>Extreme Margaret Mead who was a very<br>famous Anthropologist who who was<br>constantly arguing that Warfare is not<br>rooted in our biology but is a cultural<br>invention<br>and Douglas fry also mentioned that<br>violence is very often considered a<br>prominent part of our everyday life or<br>or of human nature because it has more<br>dramatic effects on our lives but it<br>actually constitutes a very minor part<br>of our lives the two books are the right<br>of the screen for you Stephen Pinker who<br>made the argument that violence is<br>progressively decreasing because of our<br>society and political institutions that<br>allow uh to keep violence under control<br>and more recently uh year and a half ago<br>the darker angels of our nature was<br>published you can read the bottom of the<br>main title the the the the goal of the<br>of the book was to basically say that<br>pinker's argument was flawed that there<br>is no evidence that violence is<br>decreasing so how do we answer this<br>question how do we try try to understand<br>the very core of human nature whether we<br>are violent and when we are violent why<br>we are violent<br>uh the first thing for me is that we<br>have to use a cross-disciplinary<br>approach there are too many people on<br>the planet who try to build walls in<br>science is very important to bring build<br>Bridges we need to connect different<br>disciplines and approaches because<br>cross-disciplinary work is very<br>important<br>and this is very clear when you study<br>violence because of course you can focus<br>on<br>psychological research or work done in<br>political science in sociology<br>economics as well and and<br>analyze how individuals behave in modern<br>societies when they act violently why<br>they act violently you can also use a<br>cross-cultural approach to these and<br>investigate different violence in<br>different communities and societies but<br>you will miss a very important piece of<br>information if you only focus on Modern<br>technologically advanced societies<br>because this constitute a very minor<br>part of our evolutionary history we have<br>lived in in state level societies only<br>for a few two three thousand four<br>thousand uh less than ten thousand for<br>sure years the other part the 200 000<br>and more years of evolution are not<br>accounted into an analysis of modern<br>human societies<br>so you should also look at ancestral<br>societies hunter-gatherers are the clear<br>example because they describe the type<br>of uh societies where that were used<br>more frequently or for a longer period<br>of time by humans probably more than 200<br>000 years of human evolution uh humans<br>lived in hunter-gatherer societies this<br>is a very important type of social<br>Organization for anthropologists because<br>they make the claim that the vast<br>majority of the cognitive and behavioral<br>adaptations the human have evolved<br>emerged during that period when we were<br>living in this sort of egalitarian<br>societies where some individuals were<br>hunting and some other individuals were<br>gathering food seeds or leaves fruit and<br>so on but again you will meet some<br>important piece of information from only<br>looking at under Gathering societies<br>because this is one of those area where<br>you need to decolonize the curriculum<br>accounts of under goddess societies are<br>mostly made by Western researchers who<br>have a very biased view especially in<br>the past who had a very biased view of<br>how these ancestral societies functioned<br>and also there is an argument that you<br>virtually are never or researchers have<br>never encountered a pristine undergo<br>societies because in a way or another<br>these have been affected by by<br>state level societies<br>you can look of course at ethnography<br>and history and elements that can be<br>indicative of violence weapons is a<br>clear obvious choice but also buildings<br>that are fortified buildings these are<br>clearly linked to to Warfare for example<br>but there is evidence that weapons of<br>course work for hunting but they are<br>also very important as symbols and the<br>same is for fortified buildings they may<br>function as a signal of power that is<br>and finally and this is really the area<br>I'm coming from I think it's very<br>important to look at violence from an<br>evolutionary point of view and this is<br>what I am going to mostly do this um<br>during this lecture today because you<br>need to look at what other species do<br>when and why they are violent and when<br>and why they are not violent in order to<br>understand whether humans are unique or<br>whether there are similarities between<br>humans and other species and I work<br>mostly on macaxter species at the top<br>right of the screen but of course you<br>need to have a very broad approach to<br>these and and study other species other<br>mammals reptiles birds and ants who by<br>the way are one of the best model<br>species or taxon for for<br>understanding Warfare because they have<br>armies similar to humans so how do we<br>try to address<br>Warfare and violence from an<br>evolutionary point of view the first<br>thing that we need to do is to try to<br>understand whether propensity to be<br>aggressive towards other individuals is<br>a nurse early in our Evolution and if we<br>focus specifically on warfare which I am<br>broadly defining here as aggression and<br>violence displayed between members of<br>One Community or group towards members<br>of another Community or group on the<br>basis of the fact that humans living in<br>communities of different complexities<br>and human primates the species that I<br>study mostly living in in groups then we<br>need to we can analyze our violence the<br>the we can reconstruct The evolutionary<br>history of violence and this is what has<br>been done recently by Gomez saying<br>colleagues who analyze the occurrence of<br>violence in in different groups of<br>mammals and analyze whether the observed<br>amount of violence in species that are<br>currently living so not not in the<br>fossil records whether is predicted by<br>The evolutionary history that links<br>together all these mammalian species or<br>not so what you see here is the blue<br>boxes indicate groups of animals group<br>of mammals in particular that for which<br>the occurrence of violence is lower than<br>what expected through<br>Evolution and in red you have groups of<br>animals for which the the level of<br>violence is higher than what you would<br>expect by a simply random pattern of<br>evolution<br>so we don't need to focus too much on on<br>what these various groups of mammals<br>indicate the two most important ones for<br>me are the Omi ominoidea which is the<br>group of uh mamas that contain the<br>majority of human ancestors and the one<br>more relevant for what I'm going to show<br>you in a moment is the primates so the<br>group of animals that contain humans but<br>also Apes like chimpanzees gorillas<br>orangutans and monkeys like baboons<br>macaques the groups that I study limous<br>and so on<br>so the argument was made by Gomez that<br>primates are a clear more violent group<br>of animals in comparison to other<br>mammals<br>and this is in line with what a lot of<br>researchers are doing especially from<br>anthropology there has been a lot of<br>work on the percentage of deaths in<br>society that are due to due to War uh as<br>I said I'm focusing mostly on water<br>because it's the most evident form of<br>violence but that doesn't mean that<br>other types of violence are not<br>important<br>so here you have a graph from from Kili<br>on on the occur or the percentage of<br>deaths that are due to uh war in<br>different societies and you will notice<br>without looking specifically at each<br>Society two main things the first one is<br>that there is massive variation across<br>societies this is typical of humans we<br>are extremely diverse and flexible so<br>it's very difficult to say humans do<br>this on that or that it's we are the<br>societies are very violent and those<br>that are uh not very violent and the<br>other thing that you may notice is that<br>the mean for state level violence here<br>is substantially lower than the the mean<br>for uh tribal Warfare so somehow<br>suggesting that war in modern<br>state-level societies is somehow less<br>um as is having a less prominent effects<br>on that than it used to do in in our uh<br>in in more ancestral societies you may<br>say this is weird because we have in the<br>news that humans are fighting all over<br>uh the planet especially now in Ukraine<br>uh close to us but you need to take into<br>account that these figures consider or<br>control for population size so clearly<br>now there are more of us and so the the<br>impact of these in terms of that is<br>lower simply because there are more<br>people even though we have of course<br>Weapons of Mass destructions that can<br>kill thousands and hundreds of thousands<br>of people one of my PhD students<br>Samantha awakes we decided to do an<br>investigation to go a little bit further<br>into the analysis done by Gomez because<br>here you have a violence as a single<br>trait and we wanted to analyze whether<br>different types of violence are<br>explained at least to some extent by<br>evolution<br>so we looked at the lychedur and we we<br>got data on<br>104 primary species I think so these are<br>all the species that we have in our<br>phylogenetic tree so the the the<br>lines that connect different species are<br>basically a way to reconstruct the<br>phylogenetic history of these species so<br>species that are closer together have<br>been diverged more recently and species<br>that are connected by more ties are<br>species that have diverged earlier in in<br>our evolution<br>and we analyzed five types of violence<br>in group means aggression exchange<br>between individuals belonging to the<br>same group because as I mentioned<br>earlier we are focusing on species that<br>live in stable groups<br>our group aggression is the same but<br>directly towards members of other groups<br>so these are my the forms of violence<br>and in terms of more little violence we<br>focus on adultery side within the group<br>or between groups so killing of adults<br>by adults who belong to the same group<br>or members of different groups and<br>finally we focus on infanticide which<br>unfortunately is very common in humans<br>and also in many other species<br>and what we found is that there is a<br>different effect of phylogeny so<br>evolution in primates explained with<br>different strength uh the the history<br>and the distribution of these five types<br>of violence on the phylogenetic on The<br>evolutionary tree okay so intra group<br>adulticide and outgroup adulticide are<br>the ones that are better explained by<br>evolutionary analysis so this to me<br>indicates that violence is at least to<br>some extent rooted in our evolutionary<br>past<br>another very important finding is that<br>we found roughly 45 percent of species<br>displaying at least one form of<br>adulticide<br>and this may sound like well it's not a<br>lot it's less than half of the species<br>which is true but you need to consider<br>when we started this study the records<br>for adult decide were incredibly scarce<br>in the literature rule so there were<br>only a few species and the majority of<br>the accounts were on humans of course<br>and chimpanzees our closest relatives<br>who you may have seen the Netflix series<br>so they do Warfare and they do a lot of<br>uh<br>killing of individuals<br>at least some communities not all of<br>that so this indicates this figure that<br>we obtained by talking to other<br>researchers because this was mostly<br>non-published work this this figure<br>indicates that quite a substantial<br>amount of species in the primate group<br>now there is something I should mention<br>when I say that Evolution explains<br>violence because every time you make<br>this claim that there is an evolutionary<br>uh effect evolutionary effect on<br>violence or actually on any other<br>Behavior very often the the the message<br>is delivered in a way as if researchers<br>are saying that violence is inevitable<br>but that is not the case<br>and there is a lot of misunderstanding<br>and I think same DNA but born this way I<br>still don't understand exactly what it<br>means but the point I think is that if<br>we say that violence is<br>evolutionary rooted in our past it means<br>that under specific circumstances<br>specific social and ecological<br>conditions we are likely to display<br>violence we are likely to display<br>violence it doesn't mean we are obliged<br>to display violence so explanations that<br>are linked to evolutionary explanations<br>are not deterministic in the sense that<br>culture and Free Will can still affect<br>when and why we display violence or we<br>don't display violence I'm going to<br>focus now on on how no human primates<br>interact with one another when they are<br>encountering another group and I thought<br>the best thing to do would be to show<br>you a video by Chris who is in the<br>audience on Barbary mccax in the middle<br>Atlas Mountains so what you are going to<br>see is there will be a group on the<br>right and a group on the left and they<br>exchange aggression every now and then<br>you also see monkeys looking around<br>because what they are trying to do is to<br>see what the others in their group are<br>doing because they don't they cannot<br>move on their own otherwise they are in<br>trouble as we will see in a couple of<br>slides<br>laughs<br>foreign<br>you may notice that there is a lot of<br>screening screaming and not a lot of<br>actual violence but this is quite common<br>although in these pieces you can have<br>quite substantial injuries so it's a<br>very messy process it's not as organized<br>as you you would expect or we know<br>warfaring humans uh is displayed<br>and<br>but the important thing is that we can<br>use interactions between groups<br>especially aggressive interactions<br>between groups as a way to understand<br>whether primates species closely related<br>to humans have a propensity to be<br>aggressive to to individuals belonging<br>to other groups similarly to what we<br>observe in humans<br>and humans is a very well-known fact<br>that uh at least according to Boris<br>Johnson that uh males are aggressive and<br>females are not aggressive and this is<br>probably likely to be true although<br>there are clear differences between<br>societies again we know in in in the<br>movies uh we always see the man fighting<br>and the women being in the back or in<br>the Crypt if you are a big fan of Game<br>of Thrones but this is not what is up<br>what was happening the reality<br>historians tell us that especially in<br>Under Siege women and children were<br>fighting or at least bringing food and<br>weapons to to the soldiers<br>so we need to remember that this<br>perspective is based on a male bias<br>description of what happens in our<br>societies<br>so it's important to notice that at the<br>same time that in the vast majority of<br>human societies males do indeed are the<br>sex that display more violence and the<br>same is similar in chimpanzees one of<br>our closest<br>species but again in order to understand<br>whether this sex differences persistent<br>across the primate order we need to look<br>at other species<br>and this is what exactly what we did<br>thanks to the fact that my another or my<br>former PhD students Laura managed to get<br>access to a large data set of<br>interactions between groups in a species<br>of monkey that lives in Indonesia so<br>what I'm going to show you now and it's<br>going to be graphic so please look away<br>if you don't want to see this is a video<br>of a monkey being killed by members of<br>another uh group during an Intergroup<br>encounter so this individual was<br>separated by the rest of the group<br>surrounded by members of this other<br>group and they kill these individuals<br>ready<br>the individual is still in shock but<br>alive<br>okay so it's very graphic and I'm sorry<br>about that but I think it's important to<br>show you exactly what happens in these<br>type of interactions and this is<br>incredibly interesting from from a<br>scientific point of view because what we<br>found<br>is that these pieces follow a pattern<br>that is very similar to what we observe<br>in chimpanzees and what we think happen<br>in ancestral human Warfare But the Sex<br>is swapped<br>so everything as you see on this table<br>is consistent with what we found in<br>chimpanzees and humans<br>attacks are usually massively unbalanced<br>in favor of the attackers this is the<br>ancestral type of warfare which was<br>based on ambushes and raids you only<br>attack your enemy if you outnumber them<br>otherwise it's too dangerous especially<br>uh the attackers in humans and<br>chimpanzees are mostly adult females in<br>these species are mostly adult sorry<br>adult males in these species are mostly<br>adult females<br>injuries for the attackers so<br>non-existent and again this is very<br>similar to warfarin hunter-gatherers<br>societies if you do an ambush you very<br>rarely get injured unless something goes<br>wrong you are expecting one individual<br>and all of a sudden 20 show up<br>and he was also very much directed<br>towards adult females the number may not<br>look very high but if you include also<br>sub-adult females the number goes up to<br>80 percent so it's really a female<br>business in these species<br>more than 33 percent of attacks were<br>resulted in in severe injuries for<br>victims we are a little bit unsure<br>because sometimes they run away and it's<br>impossible to follow them<br>and 16 percent of these victims died<br>now this number again may now sound like<br>a massive number but it's comparable to<br>the most violent communities among<br>chimpanzees so the claim that<br>chimpanzees are very violent and this<br>explains why humans are very violent<br>because we are in this group of animals<br>that are very violent<br>should probably be reconsidered because<br>my guess is that when we have long-term<br>data from other species and it will take<br>a long amount a huge amount of time for<br>that we may discover that some of these<br>attacks are more common the major<br>difference for me between chimpanzees<br>and human sand and macaques is that in<br>chimpanzees and humans for sure but<br>probably also in in chimpanzees<br>individuals form raid raiding parties<br>and they actively look for individuals<br>from other communities they go at the<br>border of their territory and they<br>search for isolated individuals and if<br>they find an isolated male they attack<br>and kill them<br>in macax probably because they lack the<br>the cognitive capacity that requires<br>preparation of an attack and advanced<br>planning of what is going to happen<br>later these attacks mostly occur by<br>chance they were having a fight with<br>members of another group all of a sudden<br>one individual is isolated and they<br>surround that individual once that<br>individual is surrounded there's no way<br>for them to escape unless the attacking<br>party fall asleep okay<br>why do we observe this difference<br>between males and females in chimpanzees<br>and probably at least to some extent the<br>humans males are from the same group are<br>bonding together they form they are<br>often genetically related and they form<br>a strong bonds with one another<br>so members from One Community are not<br>genetically related to members of<br>another community and because of that<br>they kill members of other communities<br>in order to gain benefits in chimpanzees<br>we know that kidney members of other<br>community result in an expansion of the<br>territory so it brings benefits more<br>food and potentially also more more<br>making partners<br>the situation is reversing in uh cracks<br>in my cars in this pieces the females<br>are the one that stay in their group<br>throughout their lives and so they form<br>bonds and are genetically related or<br>more likely to be genetically related to<br>other females in their group so they<br>have a stronger drive to compete and<br>kill females from other communities with<br>whom they are not genetically related<br>and if they kill these individuals again<br>they can have access to better food or<br>more food and also mating partners<br>so I think these tell us that we are<br>always have to look for other species in<br>order to really understand the bio<br>biology and diversity of in this<br>particular case violin but if we move<br>we can analyze what are the possible<br>causes of violence especially Warfare<br>and without the possible benefits of<br>costs of of violence<br>and I'm using here an example from a<br>study from archaeological records from<br>Southern California where Alan and<br>colleague tested whether the the<br>occurrence of a shot for stroma so<br>archaeological and fossil records that<br>were indicative of violent deaths were<br>linked to two factors the first Factor<br>on top is habitat productivity and the<br>second factor is more if you like<br>culture base or Society bases political<br>leadership<br>and what they found was that the the<br>occurrence of violence decreases<br>gradually with increased habitat<br>productivity so the graph on top tell us<br>that the more food there is the less<br>fighting takes place<br>the less food there is the more fighting<br>is needed because individuals and groups<br>need to fight with one another in order<br>to access valuable resources this is<br>classic social ecological Theory and<br>it's good that it's found in this study<br>on the contrary there is no indication a<br>political leadership is a predictor of<br>violence why did they focus on political<br>leadership because in human societies<br>and progressively more so as we move<br>into state-level societies<br>leadership is very important it's a very<br>important predictor of whether we go to<br>war or not<br>Russia Ukraine is a very good example it<br>wasn't a democratic decision to go to<br>war the leaders decide what to do the<br>majority of others follow unless the<br>leader doesn't have the strength to<br>force the others to to follow that<br>I'll come back to this point in a moment<br>but first I want to give you some some<br>evidence on the cost and benefits of War<br>because of course war is a very<br>dangerous activity if we focus on what I<br>showed you earlier there is a space for<br>escaping injuries<br>but of course you may make the claim<br>that individuals are trying to fight<br>other other groups in order to gain<br>benefits and some of these benefits<br>could be reproductive success and as you<br>can see in two different undergatherers<br>populations from South America there is<br>mixed evidence that fighting or being a<br>warrior brings reproductive success<br>benefits in terms of costs on the other<br>hand there has been a study relatively<br>recently showing that all funds of World<br>War One soldiers so soldiers who died in<br>battle during the first World War and<br>who already had a child these children<br>were less likely to survive long in<br>comparison to children born roughly at<br>the same time but whose father didn't<br>die in battle so there seems to be<br>long-term effects of costs in this<br>particular case of being involved in in<br>Warfare and I've finished this part and<br>then I'll move quickly to the last one<br>uh with a comparison sorry I'll move<br>back I as a final slide on warfare I<br>think it's important to mention the<br>difference between ancestral Warfare and<br>warfare model societies<br>the major difference between ancestral<br>societies and state level societies the<br>societies we live in is social<br>inequality<br>egalitarian hunter-gatherers shared food<br>and had equal amount of resources they<br>were all working together to have access<br>to food and they shared food<br>state level societies have more layers<br>more political inequality more wealth<br>concentrated in some individuals and<br>this has an effect on how individuals<br>behave during war<br>we can make a nice comparison thanks to<br>Peter turkey most mostly but also West<br>Hyder because in the Republican room<br>period there are accounts of what was<br>happening in relation to Warfare so we<br>know that before Rome became an Empire<br>the first the the richest one percent of<br>the population only had 10 to 20 percent<br>more wealth than the average Roman<br>citizen which you may think is a lot but<br>wait until you see U.S and very<br>interestingly<br>when Romans were fighting other other<br>armies the chances that the leaders were<br>dying in battle were higher than the<br>chances for simple soldiers meaning that<br>there was a balance between risk and<br>benefits I am more powerful so I had<br>higher risks but with desire risks also<br>come higher benefits if we win if we<br>defeat Hannibal which they didn't do<br>Academy<br>I'm going to get a lot of wealth so it's<br>in our societies I am taking us here as<br>an example but unfortunately it applies<br>to many of our societies<br>there is a massive increase in<br>inequality between the rich and the poor<br>and very importantly the reason and a<br>reverse balance in the How likely the<br>poor portion of the society is to face<br>death in battle in comparison to the<br>richest the African-American comprise 40<br>percent of total fatal of deaths in<br>during the Vietnam war but they only<br>accounted for 11 of the population so<br>this indicates that African-American<br>were put at the front line in Veteran<br>War because they were Expendables<br>according to to the the leaders of the<br>American Army<br>and this difference<br>is very important when we consider the<br>so<br>what does that mean in terms of effects<br>of<br>the risk of fighting and the risk of<br>warfare for our everyday life and for<br>our uh social behavior within and<br>there have been there has been an<br>argument proposed by several of these<br>different disciplines psychology is one<br>of those anthropology evolutionary<br>biology economics animal behavior and so<br>on that humans have experienced a<br>prolonged period of warfare or at least<br>a prolonged period of<br>situations in which the other group was<br>a Potential Threat okay<br>there is mixed evidence from this but<br>the argument is that under these<br>conditions under a situation in which a<br>member of another Community is a<br>potential enemy this type of condition<br>have led to the emergence of social<br>categorization<br>and a focus on group membership so these<br>theories with different strength and<br>different explicit hypotheses<br>predict that because we were facing in<br>our evolutionary history a substantial<br>threat from other groups we are very<br>sensitive and responsive to<br>acknowledging and noticing whether<br>individuals belong to our own group or<br>whether they belong to other groups this<br>capacity to categorize individual is<br>important and predicts how we are going<br>to behave if you are part of our group<br>or my group<br>we are fine we share similar cultural<br>norms for example similar interests and<br>we may uh we may interact friendly if<br>you belong to another group we may not<br>share similar cultural views or<br>political views and we may fight each<br>other of course in in modern<br>technological Advanced large societies<br>things are different because you cannot<br>monitor what everybody is doing but<br>there is an argument that this type of<br>social categorization is still important<br>as I as I'm going to show you now<br>so in in a in developmental psychology<br>and human psychology is a very<br>well-known fact that<br>you can trigger<br>a sensitivity to group membership very<br>easily in a study done by by these two<br>researchers they just show children<br>Design This is a one-year-old one year<br>and one year and a half old children<br>they show them to puppets<br>and they first ask the child what do you<br>like do you like green beans or do you<br>like cereals and imagine that I say I<br>like cereals then you show these two<br>puppets and you ask the child which<br>puppet they like the most and they are<br>going to say the majority of time I like<br>cereals<br>and they prefer to play with the puppet<br>that has similar choices as themselves<br>and you may say okay this makes sense I<br>don't want to play with someone who<br>likes cream green beans because they are<br>disgusting I don't like them but what is<br>interesting it's not true but I of<br>course but what I but what is<br>interesting is that also trades that are<br>that are completely meaningless like<br>whether the puppet turns right or left<br>or whether they like blue or green<br>triggers this type of group preference<br>if I like green and the puppet likes<br>green I consider that puppet as part of<br>my group if the puppet likes red I say<br>no it's someone different<br>so this sensitivity to very minor<br>sometimes non-salid traits is very<br>common in humans and may sometimes<br>translate into<br>different social choices cooperation<br>versus aggression or prejudice<br>so I called the consequences of these<br>group categorization The Good the Bad<br>and the Ugly following Sergio Leones<br>movie<br>so what is the good of this the good of<br>these is that because we are capable of<br>categorizing individuals we can identify<br>individuals with whom we want to<br>interact and act precisely<br>and this is what we found with that is<br>a lecture in our school associate<br>professor sorry in our school<br>we did a study with children where we<br>tested whether children were they were<br>how much they were going to share with<br>other members of their group<br>in a control condition the bluish<br>bars and in a between group competition<br>conditions so in the green bars we just<br>told children there's another group you<br>are fighting with another group but we<br>didn't tell them what they were fighting<br>over so what the benefit of fighting was<br>why they were fighting and what they<br>would gain from out competing the other<br>group but the mere presence of another<br>group as you can see triggers<br>cooperation so the total amount of<br>sharing goes up as soon as the group<br>knows that there are there is another<br>group<br>so this is what we call parochial<br>altruism and is a tendency to act<br>pro-socially towards members of our own<br>group<br>we are doing a study now where we are<br>testing cooperation within the group but<br>where we group children and adults in<br>groups of different heterogeneity so<br>here we tell we ask first a child do you<br>like what color do you like can I say<br>green and then I say you ask the child<br>what type of activity would you do you<br>like to do when I say I like bird<br>watching so in in the condition<br>different quality and different activity<br>I am with children or adults who all<br>like different colors or different<br>activities here they either differ in<br>terms of color preference or activity<br>and here they have the same preference<br>so here I am really with my group<br>everybody likes the color I like and<br>good news is children don't show a<br>difference in terms of pro-sociality<br>between different groups maybe because<br>they are not sensitive enough when they<br>are young to these minor forms of<br>distinction between<br>individuals but in adults we find a<br>different we are a difference we are<br>more likely to cope to cooperate so to<br>share resources with group members when<br>we identify these group members to be<br>similar to ourselves than different from<br>us<br>so the presence of an out group threat<br>or this categorization may lead to<br>increased cooperation within the group<br>but the bad news is that he may also<br>lead to Prejudice towards members of<br>other groups on the basis of very simple<br>traits color ethnicity or on the basis<br>of cultural traits whether a cat says<br>meow or or a woof or things like that so<br>preference for different cultural norms<br>may lead to Prejudice and this is<br>unfortunately a very well known fact<br>oxytocin for example has been proposed<br>as the law of hormone because initially<br>we thought when you give oxytocin<br>everybody starts to be pro-social but as<br>Robert sapolski mentioned here this is<br>very much dependent on group membership<br>if you give oxytocin to an individual<br>they will become more presocial towards<br>members of their own group but they may<br>become more aggressive or at least avoid<br>members of other groups this is still<br>early days I think there is a lot of<br>work to do on on hormones and<br>neuroscientific evidence in support of<br>this picture but it's showing that we<br>tend to discriminate quite substantially<br>between in-group and out group members<br>and here you have a run through this<br>quite quickly this is a very example of<br>what I just mentioned<br>a simulation of how police force How<br>likely they are to to shoot when they<br>have a black Target or a white Target we<br>don't need to go into details about<br>whether they do better or worse whatever<br>better and worse means here with black<br>or white Target but what is clear is<br>that there is a massive difference in<br>how they behave in this simulation<br>depending on whether the target is a<br>and something similar in happens in<br>terms of dehumanization so the fact that<br>we consider members of our groups as<br>individuals with whom we can interact<br>means that we recognize their desires<br>their personality and we can be empathic<br>towards them while situations that lead<br>to extreme forms of competition with<br>members of other groups result in the<br>dehumanization of other individuals as<br>evidence year after the Boston Marathon<br>bombing the the demonization of of<br>Arabs that was substantially increased<br>after the bombing because the threat<br>coming from the bombs<br>automatically result in a generalization<br>of fear towards individuals belonging to<br>the same ethnic group<br>and this type of dehumanization is so<br>much embedded in our societies<br>that we have these Even in our in the<br>way we call our or our societies and<br>here are a few examples but there are<br>many of these the alemanian the gods who<br>were Community societies and and the<br>groups that were living around the<br>period of the Roman Empire<br>al-amani the root means the true people<br>the gods means the people the yanomamian<br>and hunter-gatherers society that lives<br>in South America means the human beings<br>and the eskimos means real people why is<br>that one of the possible explanations if<br>you<br>like the theory that I just presented<br>you is that because we consider the out<br>group the the the the individual who<br>belongs to another group as a threat<br>we need something that brings us<br>together so if we have a group of<br>society and we are the people Everyone<br>Else Is Not a Human Being and this make<br>it easier for us to ignore them not be<br>empathic towards them or in more extreme<br>cases kill and and eliminate those<br>threats<br>and finally if I have two more minutes<br>sorry I'm taking I'm speaking too much<br>as always and finally the ugly<br>the ugly for me is that<br>very often peaceful and aggressive<br>behaviors are described as in opposition<br>we are either pro-social or we are<br>aggressive but the truth is that these<br>two phenomena are often intertwined<br>together and there is evidence<br>increasing evidence that<br>the presence of an out-group threat and<br>the constant phasing of warfare or<br>Potential Threat from other groups has<br>led to the emergence of in-group<br>cooperation so we tend to be more<br>competitive in situations in which there<br>is a Potential Threat from other groups<br>this is what was found by some Bulls on<br>on in under Gathering societies and<br>there is growing evidence in in no human<br>primates grooming for example one of the<br>most for most common forms of bonding in<br>in primates and in monkeys in particular<br>tend to increase when a group is facing<br>high frequency of competition from other<br>groups there is evidence in chimpanzees<br>and evidence in miracles<br>so the reality as Robert Stevenson says<br>here<br>is that we cannot really say humans are<br>good or Havel because on average of<br>course not all of us but on average we<br>are a combination of both okay so I'm<br>finishing with this picture which I<br>think very much<br>exemplifies the the challenges of social<br>interactions here you have two Barbary<br>macaws<br>they are always very attracted to<br>infants as the one or being called by<br>one of the females and they try to<br>interact with one another being in close<br>contact with another monkey is a sign of<br>bonding and they are also displaying<br>these facial display a battery display<br>which is often an indication of<br>submission but also of peaceful<br>intentions<br>so they are trying to bond but at the<br>same time they are facing the threat of<br>the other individual being close to<br>another individual is dangerous<br>especially if you look in the eyes of<br>another individual because in monkeys<br>looking staring at the eye of another<br>individual is an aggressive sign humans<br>is the same this is why we look up or<br>down when we are in an elevator so they<br>are trying to bond but at the same time<br>are<br>concerned about the Potential Threat of<br>pro-society and this is I think a good<br>way to finish reminding us of the<br>importance of pro Society but also the<br>potential challenge of interacting with<br>other individuals<br>so I would like to thank our University<br>because<br>our head of schools past and present has<br>always given me and the senior<br>management team have always given me the<br>freedom to explore whatever research I<br>wanted to do so thank you very much I<br>have to say a big thank you to my PhD<br>students some of them are here Richard<br>Chris<br>Leticia because I have really been<br>blessed with some of the best PhD<br>students you can possibly have and these<br>made everything easier I didn't have to<br>do anything they did the work and I'm<br>taking the credit<br>I need to thank the my family of course<br>because they have given me the time to<br>explore different ideas even when it<br>didn't make any sense the majority of<br>times<br>Moroccan and Indonesian government and<br>colleagues for collaboration and funding<br>and finally thank you very much for<br>listening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
