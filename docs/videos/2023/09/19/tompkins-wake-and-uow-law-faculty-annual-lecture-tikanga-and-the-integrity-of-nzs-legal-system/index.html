100% accurate.</p><p>uh<br>pap<br>everybody thank you all for making time<br>uh on a wed random Wednesday night uh<br>still in Winter uh with not great<br>weather uh outside for coming um to the<br>lecture tonight I apologize in advance<br>if I have a week bit of a cough um I uh<br>caught Co about 10 days ago I'm not<br>contagious um but I'm still suffering<br>sort of the remnants uh of that so ad<br>I've got to take a few pauses to sort of<br>clear the<br>chest it's a great honor and privilege<br>to be invited here tonight uh to deliver<br>this newly branded uh Thompson wake<br>lecture I was asked when it was still<br>McKenzie Alvin<br>law at the risk of oversharing way tooo<br>early I've got quite a long history as<br>Fiona pointed out with the McKenzie<br>Dynasty as she mentioned I first came<br>across the Fino in my first year of Law<br>School uh down in denen where I attended<br>KNX college with both uh Tom Alvin who<br>was also a partner at McKenzie well at<br>Tomkins wake sorry uh and also Harriet<br>Alvin who I lived with for a number of<br>years and I she also works at Tomkins<br>wake and is sort of the boss of the<br>Faro I lived with her for about uh four<br>years and there's something pretty<br>special about the bonding experience of<br>atago University and living in grungy<br>flats for a period of<br>time to Fiona and Graham I'd like to<br>take this opportunity uh to thank you<br>publicly for the emergency funds that<br>you would regularly send to Har<br>that paid a disproportionate amount of<br>our power bill at<br>times given my primary connection to the<br>foo is through those Independence<br>gaining couch boing atago University<br>years I suspect the invitation to speak<br>this evening is not because of that but<br>in spite of it I thank you for the<br>invitation to share something or share<br>my thoughts about a topic that I care<br>about I'd also like to thank uh W<br>University and the depending our law<br>faculty as you alluded to over the years<br>W University have been thought leaders<br>uh and very Progressive in the mildi<br>legal issues space uh as you mentioned<br>your whole ethos is about a BAL<br>education and I think what we're seeing<br>now is many of the law schools really<br>just trying to catch up uh to where you<br>so<br>in terms of where I wanted to start this<br>lecture I wanted to take it back like<br>way way<br>back to when hang on let me see if I can<br>going to when my tuna or ancestors first<br>arrived on the beautiful shores of Alor<br>approximately 800 to 1,000 years<br>ago they came on the matatu aaka which<br>was one of the earliest voyaging canoes<br>undertook the great navigational journey<br>across the seas from our homeland of<br>Hawaii to altero New Zealand the captain<br>of that Waka was the ranga or chief<br>TOA but we're not going to focus on the<br>man for the purposes of my<br>story instead I wanted to focus on his<br>renowned sister mudy who was also on the<br>matatu<br>Waka she was a wah of significant mana<br>and standing in her own right<br>and accompanying her on her journey or<br>on that Journey was her two twin<br>Sons now there's a reason that Alor was<br>of course one of the last places on<br>Earth to be settled right we live at the<br>bottom of the world geographically<br>isolated and the seas around us are<br>treacherous unfortunately on the journey<br>from Hawaii 2 Ted both of Moody wi's<br>twin Sons tragically fell to the peral<br>and drowned in the Pacific<br>Ocean as you can imagine Moody was<br>devastated as a response to the drowning<br>mudy placed a Rahi over a vast tract of<br>the<br>thereare which is just outside of T<br>Bowen town I think and it spanned all<br>the way to<br>toito in the east coast so for those who<br>have been along there Kate runaway F<br>parawa so that Rahi was one of the first<br>known that L is significant not only<br>because of the expansive area that it<br>covered which was large but also because<br>it said to have lasted for<br>Generations the effect of placing that<br>AR was to make that area tapoo or sacred<br>and an area from which you couldn't<br>shouldn't Traverse or gather food right<br>it become cordon off a no-go<br>area the significance of of closing the<br>ocean cupboards as one of our primary<br>sources of food for navigational coastal<br>living people should of course not be<br>understated it was a big<br>deal and it's a statement about Moody<br>way and her manner or<br>standing as well as a statement of her<br>grief for her<br>Tami that rahu is still spoken about by<br>those that live many of the I that live<br>now I want to fast forward you 800 to<br>1,000 years to the 9th of<br>December<br>2019 a day whose events are forever<br>etched into our history where another<br>backyard the 2019 eruption of<br>fakar there were 47 people on the island<br>when fakar<br>erupted sadly 22 died either in the<br>explosion itself or later from injuries<br>that were sustained in the<br>eruption the bodies of two people were<br>never found and it's thought that they<br>slipped into the sea the country and the<br>world in many ways wept with us that<br>day now the context that we now live in<br>is of course very different from that a<br>thousand years<br>earlier when mudway placed<br>toah the fabric of Mii Society has been<br>eroded over time as a result of<br>colonization as a result of assimilation<br>and systemic laws put in place as a<br>result of land loss we're well familiar<br>with that history<br>we now live in a very mixed and diverse<br>communities where people hold very<br>different<br>beliefs we use Tik Tok some of us do not<br>me but despite the great societal shifts<br>that have occurred the Mali response to<br>this tragedy was very<br>similar a number of coastal<br>e<br>including<br>and Tano apui all did what Moody<br>did they placed Rahi along the coastline<br>as this map<br>illustrates it wasn't quite as big as<br>the Rah that Moody wide<br>placed it didn't need to be partly<br>because what these Coastal ewi know is<br>that the currents from fak tend to go<br>east and so what what they did was place<br>at a from about<br>too this time the public Rahi was for a<br>much shorter period of time it was for<br>about two weeks although I do know a<br>number of Faro and hapu that during that<br>summer period didn't use the ocean or<br>eat fish from the ocean so for a longer<br>same I went down to the beach cuz I live<br>in fatani most days for that two we<br>period and it was Eerie in some ways<br>because we are a coastal Oceano<br>Community but there was no one in the<br>water there were no boats in the water<br>there were no people in the water there<br>was no one Gathering food during that<br>period for a brief sort of two weeks we<br>all collectively<br>sea businesses rely on the sea in fakat<br>right this was December not quite the<br>middle of summer anymore because the<br>climate changed but pretty hot still<br>then<br>right<br>I found it remarkable that that was<br>observed not just by those who<br>necessarily Believe In And subscribe to<br>Tonga but it was observed by the whole<br>occasion I've drawn on those examples<br>because what I'm hoping it starts to do<br>or might start to do is to help us think<br>about the tapestry of law that operates<br>in Alor in a deeper richer and more<br>complex<br>way one of the<br>Tendencies of many Mai is of course to<br>identify t as lore alari instead of<br>law I looked up the definition of alari<br>which in the Oxford dictionary refers to<br>stories and traditions of a particular<br>group of<br>people of course<br>Tia does have stories and traditions<br>associated with it but it is much deeper<br>than<br>that tiang is a living evolving Dynamic<br>pragmatic responsive way that m not only<br>view the world but it's also what<br>regulated and still regulates to a<br>certain extent behavior and<br>relationships between people as well as<br>environment I 100% appreciate why some<br>have an allergic reaction to calling it<br>lore lore is a non- mildy word that has<br>significant cultural baggage associated<br>with<br>it it's also been one of the primary<br>instruments through which Mali have<br>suffered significant harm over the last<br>180 years years or<br>so further most of us particularly those<br>who have gone to law school have it<br>drilled into us that law just comes from<br>two<br>Parliament state<br>law that's what's deserving of that<br>law but I think it's important to<br>understand that the state does not have<br>a monopoly over or exclusively own the<br>concept of<br>law there are different layers and ways<br>of thinking about<br>it I used to teach the subject of jurist<br>prudence uh at Oakland law school for a<br>number of years right jurist Prudence is<br>like the theory of<br>law it was compulsory up there and a<br>subject that most students hated<br>actually<br>taking and take it from me there are<br>literally thousands of books and<br>libraries filled with people<br>pontificating about this question of<br>Law and it's easy to get tangled in what<br>it is what it isn't and specific<br>definitions about<br>it but to me if you strip it down law is<br>a very human<br>construct in a way of ordering society<br>Behavior although the idea has been used<br>in different ways across time cultures<br>and<br>contexts if L is what governs Society<br>it it's the first law of<br>Al and it dictated the rules of how we<br>world although the meeting of Two Worlds<br>cultures and laws has of<br>course impacted<br>tikanga and in many ways left it<br>battered and bruised it still<br>survives you see it on<br>Ali you see it in our<br>homes if you understand it you see it<br>itched into our<br>landscape and in the layers of Rights<br>and interests that flow from our history<br>of engaging with each other and with the<br>environment you see it in the example of<br>the<br>rahui that I used where each of those<br>iwi had the manor to place arahi over<br>their ocean<br>territory permission was neither sought<br>or required from the<br>Parliament it wasn't required a thousand<br>years ago it wasn't required in 2019<br>their Source Authority and effect in<br>both instances flowed from and was<br>grounded in Tik a separate source of law<br>in<br>altero if we think about law as being a<br>mechanism through which behavior is<br>regulated I want you to just think to<br>questions think about the fakar Rahi<br>that was<br>placed would you or did you if you were<br>why just pause and think about that for<br>a<br>moment there's likely to be a lots of<br>different answers in this room both as<br>to whether you would follow it or not<br>and why you may have done<br>so but I'm going to throw out a couple<br>of suggestions as to the why and put<br>your hand up if you feel that it<br>resonates with<br>you so one reason might be you agreed<br>with the reason for<br>it<br>I.E Rahi serves a function and a<br>purpose respecting those who passed on<br>on that<br>island as well as a very pragmatic<br>reason of not wanting to be exposed to<br>the dead there were people still in the<br>water at that stage so put your hand up<br>if<br>that would have been one of the reasons<br>lahi another<br>reason you may have been swayed by<br>consequence whether that be the<br>spiritual consequen of breaching a tppo<br>or wanting to avoid the scary mes that<br>beach put your hand up if that may have<br>been one of the reasons that you would<br>less you might be or another reason<br>possible<br>reason is you may have followed it<br>because it's what is<br>ticker or the right thing to do you're a<br>rule<br>follower someone says don't do it you<br>don't do<br>it put your hand up if you fell into<br>that<br>category finally you may have respected<br>the authority of the E to place<br>it put your hand up if you fall into<br>that<br>category now I want to Pivot away from<br>that example for a second to a<br>completely different<br>one that you'll all be familiar with you<br>wake up you get out of your bed you have<br>a shower you jump in your car and you<br>sign why do you stop at a stop<br>sign<br>again might be many reasons for<br>that one put your hand up if it's<br>because the very pragmatic reason of not<br>else<br>ker it makes sense right there's an<br>ordering of society that needs to occur<br>and the pragmatic rule or the pragmatic<br>reason behind it makes sense in that<br>context put your hand up if you're<br>swayed by the potential punishment IE<br>$150 or whatever it is if you<br>breach or the telling off from the cops<br>who might be waiting around the<br>corner less<br>people put your hand up if you stop<br>because it's law that's the rule and you<br>rules and finally you may respect the<br>Democratic lawmaking institution that we<br>voted in Parliament to to make laws for<br>the good of people put your hand up if<br>you fall into that<br>category way<br>less we're all pragmatic people in here<br>right I guess the point of drawing on<br>those two different examples one<br>grounded in tukong one grounded in state<br>law is to just to start to get you<br>thinking about the nature of<br>law both of<br>those examples the the stopping at the<br>stop sign and the rahu<br>example both are intended to regulate<br>Behavior both claim a form of authority<br>whether you follow it or<br>not and both have mechanisms for<br>enforcement albe it different types of<br>each I think it's now relatively<br>uncontroversial to call k a system and<br>law in fact in a Supreme Court decision<br>that I'll come to talk about soon one of<br>the judges in that decision says tikanga<br>will continue to be applied by Mai and<br>will continue to develop independent of<br>its place as part of the common law or<br>legislation and policy in this sense<br>law the more Challen Ching question<br>though is no matter what you call it<br>what does it mean what does it mean for<br>us what does it mean for Mai what does<br>it mean for the Gen populace who has to<br>follow it what is its intersection with<br>state<br>law if there is a rahui over an area<br>like the one uh that was placed up in um<br>Oakland because of the Cod dbck<br>disease do we have to follow it<br>challenging questions to work through as<br>a<br>society my observation is that there's<br>two things happening in Alor in this<br>moment one of them is that for the past<br>40 years there has been a process of<br>reclamation uh rejuvenation<br>and a<br>strengthening of Mai<br>Society it had been eroded for a long<br>period of<br>time but in the 1980s for those of you<br>who were alive<br>then right it was a time of protest it<br>was a time of<br>activism around the world not just in<br>Alor but there's those beautiful images<br>of Fina Koopa walking H Muna on the Mali<br>land March down to to Parliament that<br>was a result of Mali being at breaking<br>Extinction<br>point it's a result of a generation who<br>never learned how to speak tidel but<br>they went to UNI got an education and<br>decided hey we we don't want to miss out<br>on that right so that's been one of the<br>things that's been<br>years and what you I think one of the<br>developments or one of the things think<br>about conceptually is if you're thinking<br>about tikanga as its separate source of<br>law one of the developments is that<br>maldi are reclaiming that it never went<br>away but there was a huge impact on it<br>for many years that in many ways<br>impacted our ability to exercise<br>it so that's one of the developments<br>society alongside that is you start to<br>get Tia speaking more to state<br>law it always<br>has we have cases from before<br>1840 that talk about the recognition of<br>customary law in the state law in our<br>courts in the common<br>law but there was a long period of<br>time where that was not recognized<br>despite those precedents that we<br>have so what I want to talk about for<br>the balance of my lecture and I have no<br>idea what the time is and I have no idea<br>development How Tia is increasingly<br>being drawn upon as part of the state<br>legal system or increasingly part of our<br>way there is a lot to be said about that<br>and we could be here and have a whole<br>course on that subject right there's a<br>lot happening in that space at the<br>moment so I thought the best way to look<br>at the issue would be to view it from a<br>I guess through the lens of a particular<br>case that I was involved in and partly I<br>think it's because it's is illustrative<br>and can help show us the trajectory of<br>where I think our legal system is<br>going Tia came before The Supreme Court<br>in their most unlikely<br>of cases a couple of years<br>ago the Peter Alice<br>case most unlikely because there were no<br>case the facts are likely familiar to<br>you but I'll Traverse them very<br>briefly Mr Alice was convicted of child<br>sex offending in<br>1993<br>he was an early childhood Early Child<br>Care teacher down at a crash in Christ<br>Church the case was and still is a very<br>well- known<br>one<br>and I understand had a major impact on<br>males in the teaching profession in<br>general in<br>1999 the court of up the court of appeal<br>upheld the verdict as did a subsequent<br>ministerial<br>inquiry 20 years<br>later in<br>2019 the Supreme Court granted him leave<br>conviction so they said they would hear<br>his<br>case I.E that there was a possible<br>miscarriage of justice that may have<br>occurred<br>the primary grounds upon which it was<br>being appealed was that the evidence<br>that they had relied upon I.E the child<br>uh interviews those had been conducted<br>in a safe in an unsafe way that<br>effectively implanted a various memories<br>kids so he was granted leave in<br>2019 he then<br>cancer the issue that then confronted<br>the Supreme<br>Court was what do we do<br>case in that particular case Mr Alice<br>had instructed his lawyer that he wanted<br>the case to continue so there was clear<br>instructions from the client he also was<br>n needed in the case I.E it was a matter<br>of law that was appe being appealed he<br>didn't need to give further Evidence or<br>anything like that for example so some<br>of those pragmatic kind of things that<br>lawyers um think about in terms of<br>making sure you've got instruction Etc<br>were less relevant in this particular<br>case usually what happens when someone<br>dies is KATU that's it right the case<br>dies with the person the end the few<br>exceptions in New Zealand law when that<br>hasn't been the case has tended to be<br>when like money issues are<br>involved so for example when like a Fino<br>needs to carry on the case to try and<br>get money from someone uh on behalf of<br>the<br>estate so our traditional English common<br>law view of the<br>world is that when a person dies their<br>interests end with<br>them right so it's a very<br>individualistic<br>particular to the person way of thinking<br>proceedings the Supreme Court and so I<br>wasn't involved in the case at this<br>point the Supreme Court initially heard<br>arguments from that second picture is Mr<br>Rob Harrison who was lawyer for Mr Alice<br>in the original hearing when he was<br>convicted and then also came back sort<br>of 20 years later to be involved in the<br>case so heard arguments from Mr Harrison<br>as well as the solicitor general una<br>yagos so they got up armed with as you<br>do or your International precedents from<br>like Canada and Australia trying to<br>argue the<br>case when they got there one of the oral<br>questions that was posed to them by<br>Justice glazbrook one of the wah Supreme<br>Court judges was what's the relevance of<br>tikanga to this<br>case they were not prepared to answer<br>that<br>question so what then happened was that<br>court adjourned and they were given an<br>opportunity to do so and they were asked<br>three<br>questions is Tia relevant to this<br>case if so what is the tikanga that<br>applies and how does it apply to this<br>particular factual<br>scenario the question they were dealing<br>with wasn't whether he was<br>guilty the question was should the case<br>died now at that point these Parky<br>lawyers freaked<br>out cu they didn't know how to answer<br>that question or even where to<br>start I actually only came on board<br>because I saw it uh a stuff.co do in Z<br>article seeing that they'd been asked<br>this question was like oh and I'd sort<br>of written some articles and stuff and<br>was very interested in this<br>topic saw that that asked this lawyer<br>Googled him par lawyer from<br>blenham I was like he might need some<br>help so I flicked him an email gave him<br>a call and said hey do you want some<br>help I'll just do it for free in the<br>background help you write your<br>submissions I just don't want you to if<br>this<br>up cuz it's the first time the Supreme<br>Court had really apart from in a 200 12<br>case of the body snatching case for<br>those who are familiar with takam Mori<br>first time that' really been asked and<br>would directly confronting the question<br>of where does Tik fit in our<br>laws right I like we can't get this<br>wrong so anyway I came on to the legal<br>team alongside with another M lawyer<br>King e<br>Saga what then happened was the crown<br>got a number of their M lawyers uh who<br>were working for them to to come on and<br>give them advice and the Mal Law Society<br>also waited in at this point as<br>well what you usually do when you asked<br>a question uh like that right we're used<br>to that very adversarial environment so<br>you'll go back you'll arm up with your<br>team of experts who both say different<br>things and then you'll come to court and<br>scrap it out and whoever has the<br>greatest sort of credentials or whoever<br>sort of sound the smartest and the<br>brightest and whoever has the most Manor<br>you know the court will be more<br>convinced by them so that was the usual<br>approach to what you would do in that<br>scenario what all of the people decided<br>to do and credit to the<br>crown CU this is the first time they'd<br>done this we all decided what do you do<br>w right so we brought together about 10<br>Tia experts uh down in Wellington so you<br>start that Drew on the likes of Sir h m<br>who wrote the book on Tik Mai sir po Tim<br>Professor ra Higgins a bunch of these<br>incredible Tik experts to ask<br>them so we spent two days having a w<br>around How Tia might apply to the<br>particular fact scenario of the Alice<br>case<br>their answer was actually really simple<br>days in<br>Mari when a har or a wrong is<br>done it negatively impacts people and<br>Mana both of the individual and the<br>Collective Now in the Alice case it's<br>unclear at that stage where the hter<br>sits right he had been<br>convicted<br>but then there was also the question<br>that the Supreme Court opened the door<br>up to whether he was possibly<br>innocent or if not innocent whether his<br>conviction shouldn't stand right so<br>unclear where the had sits but in Mali<br>when there's been a<br>wrong there needs to be a rebalancing of<br>that<br>wrong and that can be an<br>intergenerational<br>process as we all know we still scrap<br>about things that happen many many<br>centuries<br>ago we've got a bug beer with t about<br>how<br>they you know so in t maldi that process<br>of trying to get to a state of air about<br>EA a state of balance is one that<br>transcends<br>death so that was the effectively what<br>the Tia experts told us<br>so we then had to go back into court<br>with that information to pitch our<br>different arguments about knowing that's<br>what it says what should the court now<br>do so I was fortunate at that point to<br>make the oral submissions for Mr Ellis<br>Court what I did to try and get them to<br>picture one of the tasks that they were<br>charged with doing is to draw on a<br>fakat or<br>C that was said<br>by the first<br>Mali King where he said this at his<br>coronation in<br>said there is but one eye of the needle<br>through which the white the black and<br>the red threads must<br>pass he said that in response to the<br>words ofu a chief<br>of who said to<br>him I'll just say the English<br>version this day I create you king of<br>the mai people you and Queen Victoria<br>shall be bound together as one one the<br>religion of Christ shall be the mantle<br>of your protection the law shall be the<br>FY for your feet forever and ever<br>onward drawing on that<br>metaphor I asked the court to<br>Weavers not the only one in Al but one<br>of the Weavers that add to the fabric of<br>system what I invited them to do is when<br>they do that to not only draw draw on<br>the threat of law that is derived and<br>comes from<br>England but also to pick up the threat<br>of law grounded here grounded in TI and<br>laws what I did<br>hopefully is paint a framework for how<br>the intersection of Tia and the law<br>currently<br>works right first and it's this is not<br>up there right is the way that I<br>initially talked about it exists<br>separately right it's law in and of its<br>own<br>right and like the Rahi doesn't need the<br>state legal system for it to have any<br>form of validity or<br>effect but there are a bunch of other<br>ways it is also relevant in the state<br>legal system<br>one is when legislation directly<br>recognizes<br>it so there are a number of ways in<br>which Parliament has decided to weave<br>Tik into our<br>laws so for example the resource<br>management act talks about<br>kak for those who work with the new<br>tamiki act the old child Youth and<br>man<br>as<br>Concepts that form part of the directly<br>enforcable law of<br>Al and as lawyers we need to Grapple<br>with those and when you're grappling<br>with them you're not only referring to<br>those words you're referring to the<br>whole inter connected system and Matrix<br>and system of law from which those words<br>come<br>from so that's way<br>one way two is thinking about Tik in the<br>common law as a source of of Rights and<br>interests that can be enforcable in<br>court since before since as I said<br>before before 1840 there's a number of<br>cases in the common law that said that<br>when a new legal system is implanted<br>somewhere it will recognize the local<br>land so part of the arguments that are<br>being W woven in is that in the<br>legislative<br>cracks judges can fill that in with the<br>common<br>law so these sorts of things are for<br>example if you think about although it's<br>now being replaced by a legislative<br>scheme the rights and interests that are<br>claimed in the tuu time right<br>proprietary type rights rights that are<br>are are derived from existing there for<br>a period of time and exercising your<br>customary rights and<br>interests there is an extent to which<br>you can draw on those and have them<br>enforced through the courts the extent<br>of how far we're still testing out but<br>that's a stream of law that's<br>recognizable Tia is also relevant<br>through<br>tiangi which is also peer potted through<br>legislation and and has a legal impact<br>as part of the interpretive tools that<br>we use in our<br>law where you have tititi you have Tia<br>associ with it because it<br>protects part of R is your right to<br>exercise your<br>laws right so it comes in through that<br>route as<br>well the final way and this was the way<br>case was that tikanga can be relevant to<br>informing the development of the common<br>law in<br>general<br>so in this particular case we weren't<br>there saying Mr Alice as a parha can<br>draw on Tik because he has rights and<br>interests in<br>tikanga that was not the argument we<br>were<br>making the argument we were making was<br>that the laws of altero the common law<br>of New Zealand when we are developing it<br>for our society as a whole can draw on<br>ideas of<br>TI when we're developing<br>it so that's effectively what we were<br>saying<br>here despite our laws generally saying<br>the interests die with the person<br>tikanga can provide a framework and a<br>different way of thinking about it that<br>would enrich and enhance our laws and<br>that may be more reflective of an<br>appropriate way of thinking about that<br>in aled or New<br>anyway we then had to wait like two<br>years to get a decision but anyway we<br>got it in the<br>end the outcome of the Supreme Court<br>decision which we knew fairly quickly<br>was that they were going to Grant it it<br>was able to continue we didn't know why<br>they said we'll release that when we<br>release the substantive judgment that's<br>why it took so<br>continuance they then it was last year<br>now they then released the substantive<br>decision as to why and there were some<br>really powerful statements and I would<br>commend that you read the case if you're<br>interested in this particular topic CU<br>they Traverse the issue I think quite<br>sensitively now for those who aren't<br>lawyers the Supreme Court is made up of<br>five people and they don't always agree<br>so you tend to have multiple different<br>judgments and then you have to figure<br>out what the majority<br>says so in this case they wrote four<br>different<br>judgments and so they all sort of said<br>slightly different<br>things but there were some things on<br>which they all agreed or at least the<br>majority<br>agreed so five out of<br>five said Tia has been and will continue<br>to be recognized in the development of<br>relevant one of them expanded on what<br>she thought this meant Justice glazbrook<br>and she said what this means in practice<br>will need to be worked out on a caseby<br>casee<br>basis it might be<br>controlling it might be a relevant<br>consideration it might have an<br>influence it might provide a new<br>vocabulary of framework for thinking<br>three out of five said tikanga was the<br>first law of Alto in New Zealand and it<br>continues to shape and regulate the<br>lives of<br>maldi and three out of five also said<br>that care must be taken not to Impe the<br>operation of tikanga as a system of law<br>and custom in its own<br>right so what the judges were doing were<br>trying to carefully navigate what I<br>described sort of at the start<br>the system of law what it means how it<br>operates separately and how are we going<br>us I think it's a very exciting time to<br>be involved in the law because we are<br>figuring that<br>out on a very slow<br>basis it's open to<br>argue not only that Tik is a tool for<br>Mali to claim particular rights and<br>interests but we're also heading to a<br>place where tikanga can have an<br>sense and starts to impact how the law<br>develops in<br>general one of the cases that I'm<br>currently involved<br>in is quite interesting it's uh<br>currently before The Supreme<br>Court but it was a case taken by Mike<br>Smith one of<br>thei up there against seven of the<br>largest climate change emitters uh in<br>altero he's claiming that they are a<br>duty and taught uh to him there's a<br>whole bunch<br>of doctrinal<br>implications um and it was struck out in<br>the courts below we're waiting on the<br>Supreme Court decision but one of the<br>arguments made was that tikanga<br>arguments and ideas of treating and<br>acting in kaiak kitanga with the natural<br>world can help enrich the way we think<br>environment<br>will tikanga always be relevant to a<br>case<br>no right it won't always be relevant to<br>the case that you're working with uh for<br>those lawyers in the room it's something<br>you need to navigate carefully with your<br>clients whether it's appropriate to make<br>that argument T may not be<br>supportive of your argument<br>either right so it won't always be<br>relevant but we're now at a space where<br>it's possible to argue its relevance and<br>the tricky question more is grappling<br>with<br>how I think again there's significant<br>opportunity for us to develop a law<br>that's truly unique and endemic to<br>altero in New<br>Zealand that does not come with no risk<br>though right this Pro proc that we're<br>engaged in this nation building process<br>that we're engaged<br>in based on the historical experience of<br>Mai courts have tended to treat tikanga<br>and Mai<br>poorly there is a risk of when you're<br>handing something over to a<br>judge that they<br>misinterpret that they<br>misappropriate that they misapply that<br>framework of thinking<br>so I know many Mali that are concerned<br>about what that<br>means because you start to let some of<br>it go to someone else right and there<br>are risks associated with<br>that part of I think what we're<br>grappling with at the<br>moment are how we limit those types of<br>risks and how we<br>responsibly and carefully Traverse that<br>intersection in a way that up holds the<br>Integrity of not only tianga but that<br>then flows on to the upholding of the<br>Integrity of the New Zealand legal<br>system in<br>general so for example the W process<br>that I talked about in the Alice<br>case that was one way in which it was<br>those experts who told us how Tia<br>applied right so difference to those<br>people who are knowledgeable drawing on<br>those people in respon responsible<br>ways the education of all of the legal<br>actors is something that's also<br>occurring Professor Roy talked about the<br>movement in law<br>schools there's also judges and<br>lawyers that are now getting additional<br>training in tikung this is not so that<br>they become Professor<br>po right this is so that these people<br>and us as legal actors develop an<br>awareness more of the limits of our own<br>knowledge so that we know what we don't<br>know more than anything else and know<br>when and how to seek help when we're<br>traversing this kind of boundary in a<br>responsible<br>way I also think the best way of<br>protecting tikanga in all spaces is the<br>work that's been being done in the<br>revitalization<br>space if our sphere of law is strong the<br>drawing of tikanga into that state law<br>sphere is not a threat but something<br>that is<br>complimentary so I have no idea what the<br>time is they Del it's like casinos<br>deliberately no clocks in<br>here but just by way of concluding<br>thoughts thank you for your time thank<br>you for being a patient audience<br>I think we're at an important point in<br>the history of<br>ala a period of nation building with Mai<br>and M Mai are being drawn upon across<br>all sorts of areas not only in the law<br>in education in health in all sorts of<br>spaces in a way that I hope is<br>beneficial I think it's both exciting<br>and tricky and we've all got careful<br>done<br>foreign<br>my name's James mcgil I'm a partner at<br>Tomkins wake and I'm going to be<br>bringing this microphone round to any<br>anyone who wants to ask a question in a<br>moment so I'll get you put your hands up<br>in a second but I'll kick us off um<br>Natalie that risk of colonialization I<br>think is a very real thing because you<br>kick something like this over to people<br>with my training and we're going to want<br>someone to put in a book basically give<br>me a book give me a book on Tunga so I<br>can read about it and apply it like law<br>um and it makes me think of the example<br>of equity in the English legal system<br>which starts off as this very very<br>flexible um set of of ideas that sits<br>alongside a legal system and then that<br>gets drawn into the legal system and<br>lawyers dra drag it into legal processes<br>and apply legal thinking to it and what<br>does it end up it ends up looking like<br>law um is the key to stopping that from<br>happening to change the processes by<br>which we determine legal issues<br>ker I think that's a really good<br>question because one of the Tendencies<br>of the state legal system is to codify<br>right and have a bunch of precedents<br>from which sort of then uh is locked in<br>I think process is important but there's<br>also an understanding that I think<br>everyone needs about the way that<br>tikanga operates to help avoid<br>that right so if you understand that Tia<br>is something that that is context<br>specific it's not an an idea that we're<br>unfamiliar with if you have an idea that<br>Tik if you understand it as a system of<br>law that is derived from the collective<br>communities from which it derives if you<br>understand that you start to know that<br>to get an answer of how Tik applies you<br>do need to start going to those experts<br>to ask how it<br>applies right the Alice case may have<br>turned out very different in a different<br>factual scenario from a TIA<br>perspective right if that issue had been<br>ly dormant for 20<br>years say and there had been a state of<br>process the Tia experts may have said no<br>forward but in this case the door had<br>been open so they said well that's kind<br>of disrupted it there's a question at<br>play that needs to be answered right so<br>I guess part of it is an education thing<br>and I also think there is a process<br>thing that you've hit the nail on the<br>head on we are increasingly asking<br>Pinger or experts to sit alongside<br>judges to help guide them as they're<br>engaging more in this<br>space and and it seems to me if it's<br>going to be respected it's going to be a<br>less adversarial process yes yeah and I<br>think there's there so there's the<br>adversarial process and there's a a few<br>things to be said about that I think as<br>well I think there is the rigor and the<br>robustness of the adversarial process<br>that we traditionally have really liked<br>but there is a beauty in the W<br>process right that w a process of<br>bringing people<br>together to talk about it to work it out<br>as a collective and so I think as<br>lawyers or people engaged in the law<br>it's about facilitating those types of<br>processes to help us answer some of the<br>questions that I need that I think we<br>need to answer over the coming<br>decades Natalie um you talked about<br>enforcement earlier um if it's not going<br>to if tiang is not going to rely on the<br>state to sort of weave it in and and<br>enforce it and maybe monopolize it is<br>there any what other enforcement Avenues<br>are there besides being chased down the<br>beach<br>well the enforcement mechanisms we<br>legal but what but what I instead of<br>enforcement I think that where we're at<br>is a place where we need to think about<br>it more in the sort of positive way so<br>where I see tikanga as having the most<br>value at the moment is helping us<br>resolve our own internal<br>disputes and You Know M for a long time<br>and it's strategic and I understand why<br>we do it we go to the court to do that<br>right I think part of the strengthening<br>of our um own institutions is hopefully<br>we won't need to do that we can start to<br>matties right so I guess I<br>guess it's not about Tia necessarily<br>being used as a whip for everybody else<br>I think there's a journey that we're all<br>on I thought it was illustrative that I<br>think most people in here followed the<br>fakar dahu or would have right for<br>various reasons not because you<br>necessarily think it's law but I think<br>as we're sort of increasingly weaving it<br>into our Collective Consciousness what<br>it is and why we're doing<br>it right more people will start to<br>respect<br>it K Natalie Mora yeah thank you for<br>that I'm interested around um t or<br>whitei treaty question and um how this<br>is impacting or could potentially<br>impact our way forward in article one<br>article<br>twoa up till now we're well we're<br>agitating for them to be medically<br>sealed that you have a process you have<br>a process and of course man motaki sits<br>of here we<br>having emerging in my<br>view of something out of the theong of<br>Within I understand it because in your<br>last statement you talked about it's a<br>process that would be very helpful in<br>theal for processing some of the ru or<br>whatever comes up but in the Peter Ellis<br>case for<br>example which<br>is particularly a par thing we're<br>having a merging<br>together of K<br>and and I wonder if you see I can and<br>there's some beauty in that I can<br>immediately see but I can also see<br>perhaps uh some of the the dangers where<br>people would say oh you've got what you<br>need now you're you have it within the<br>kaana Tanga process so you don't need<br>that other process does that question<br>make sense yeah it does the way that I<br>see it is I don't see the kind of<br>recognition<br>of as being mutually exclusive to what<br>is also happening in the general state<br>legal system so that's why I sort of<br>used that example of the Rahi at the<br>beginning because that's applying in<br>that Raa space that's applying without<br>necessarily having to go to the courts<br>or having to go to Parliament for it to<br>have any form of legitimacy it had<br>legitimacy in and of its own right<br>that's the exercise of<br>R right we saw it again with some of the<br>coid responses where Tano upo shut down<br>their whole out of a precaution because<br>they were scared that their whole Coast<br>was going to be wiped out right so you<br>see I think that Raa space and some of<br>the revitalization stuff that's going on<br>there strengthening our own institutions<br>but I don't see the drawing of Mal fard<br>into the state legal sphere as<br>necessarily compromising<br>that different people have different<br>opinions on that question though but<br>that's the way I see it and the space<br>that I'm in as a lawyer is playing in<br>the state legal space so trying to<br>create change in that Arena but I don't<br>see that the way I live at night or um<br>able to sleep at night is I don't see it<br>Copa</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
