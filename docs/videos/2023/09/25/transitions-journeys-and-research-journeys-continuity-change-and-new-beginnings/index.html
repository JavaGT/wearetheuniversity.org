Further research, in partnership with teachers, examined the implications of transitions for curriculum and pedagogy in Aotearoa New Zealand, and the chance to explore international approaches to transition in a five-country project. Over time this research interest broadened to other transitions across the life span and the theoretical perspectives that help to evaluate approaches to supporting transition experiences.<br><br>Sally’s research has informed curriculum and pedagogy and she has enjoyed supporting a wealth of student research into different transitions. As interest in this area has grown internationally it appears that the entire idea of transitions is at a critical crossroad both conceptually and methodologically. In the lecture’s conclusion Sally draws from a forthcoming book where she and the other two editors have taken Robert Frost’s poem The Road Not Taken to reflect on research journeys in the field of early years transitions, the current crossroad and new roads still to be taken.<br><br>About Professor Sally Peters <br>Professor Sally Peters is Head of School, Te Kua Toi Tangata School of Education.<br><br>Sally first came to the University of Waikato as a student in 1987. After graduating with a Diploma of Teaching she continued to study a Bachelor of Education then a Masters of Education, initially balancing teaching and study and then as a researcher on a Ministry of Education project looking at young children’s mathematics, led by Jenny Young-Loveridge. After embarking on her PhD, Sally was appointed as a lecturer at the Institute for Early Childhood studies at Victoria University in Wellington.<br><br>Returning to the University of Waikato in February 2000, her research has focussed predominantly on children's learning and development, with a sustained focus on educational transitions, leading to recognition as a national and international leader in transitions research.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>foreign<br>ER<br>called<br>nor Birmingham<br>foreign<br>I want to start with some thank yous<br>um and thank you very much for coming<br>this evening I really appreciate you<br>being here I want to start my lecture<br>with my thank yous sometimes with these<br>professorial lectures people in them<br>with the thank yous I thought I'd like<br>to do mine at the beginning so I wanted<br>to start off<br>um firstly by thanking my family<br>especially my parents I know they would<br>have loved to see me make it to<br>Professor they always believed I would<br>and constantly encouraged me to reach<br>high but be happy and do what I enjoyed<br>I want to thank my sister for constant<br>encouragement and it's a really special<br>thanks to my wonderful daughter Victoria<br>who's lived this whole journey with me<br>and uh to her husband Mike and my<br>grandchildren Iona and Fergus together<br>they provide the inspiration and the joy<br>in my life<br>I want to thank my colleagues<br>I mentioned a few colleagues in the<br>lecture but it's a short lecture so I<br>couldn't mention everybody so I hope<br>that the many of you that are here<br>tonight know how much I appreciate you<br>even if you don't get an individual<br>mention and I want to thank the teachers<br>the families the children who've been<br>part of the many projects that I've been<br>part of and also the funding bodies that<br>make the work possible<br>so by lectures about transitions there's<br>three themes to my my research<br>um<br>as Neil introduced you to I've been very<br>interested in children's thinking and<br>their well-being but tonight given the<br>framework for the lecture the time frame<br>I'm focusing specifically on the<br>so I'm going to start by expanding on my<br>pepiha by sharing a few of my own<br>transitions<br>I'm going to invite you as I do that to<br>reflect on some of the transitions that<br>you've made the photo there is me in the<br>garden if we didn't make transitions we<br>wouldn't have all the opportunities that<br>life gives us<br>some of those transitions are planned<br>and some are unplanned<br>some of the times they're forced<br>sometimes they're extreme intrinsically<br>motivated and we've Chosen and planned<br>for them<br>I think when you reflect on your<br>transitions were there any that were<br>particularly significant either at the<br>time when you were making them or<br>sometimes when we reflect back<br>this has become a real interest for me<br>as you can tell over 30 years of<br>research looking at different aspects of<br>transition<br>so one of the interesting things I think<br>about transitions is that they provide<br>both the tones of both crisis and<br>opportunity in lives that are always in<br>the process of becoming<br>so just to start with some of my own in<br>the Pepe how I mentioned a few important<br>places I was born in Birmingham<br>um I recognize Northeast to Moana but<br>the the black and white photo is<br>Spaghetti Junction that was being built<br>while I was a child the river tame flows<br>through there I used to always recognize<br>the Thames as my my River but discovered<br>the time when I looked more closely into<br>it and it's often called apparently the<br>Forgotten River so I felt a little bit<br>better that I had forgotten it until<br>more recently when I was exploring my<br>Pepi hat I'm the little chip in the<br>middle I'm going to talk about a bit<br>more in a minute I was in The Merchant<br>Navy as my first job and was really<br>fortunate to travel to lots of countries<br>that I wouldn't otherwise have had the<br>opportunity to do so<br>when I got married I moved to Edinburgh<br>and Victoria was born in Edinburgh and<br>then we came here thanks to Huntley<br>power station they were looking for<br>engineers and my husband was recruited<br>to come to hudley power station and<br>we've really loved being in New Zealand<br>so for over 30 years we came on a<br>three-year contract and I've been here<br>ever since<br>just quickly to mention some family<br>transitions the photo of my my parents<br>wedding and I've circled my grandparents<br>one grandfather's behind mum he passed<br>away before I was born but the<br>transitions really for the family<br>um my sister and I are the the photo<br>below<br>my parents had been married 18 years<br>before they had me so I think I was<br>probably a bit of a transition for the<br>whole family my sister and my parents<br>next to that is me and my husband with<br>Victoria I was a young mum and we had<br>Victoria in the first year of marriage<br>so a very different<br>um<br>different experience we were lucky<br>enough to have four generations of women<br>at one time in our lives and the photo<br>there is my granddaughter Victoria<br>um Iona with Victoria myself and my mum<br>and now we have Fergus and the Fido<br>above is my lovely family at the moment<br>so many transitions that we make to<br>Parenthood as a sibling to a new arrival<br>to marriage<br>um to losing parents to losing loved<br>ones<br>and then for career transitions mine's<br>not been the obvious journey I think I<br>started off as I said in the Merchant<br>Navy I found this when my dad died he<br>kept the little newspaper article about<br>me going to see so there's many possible<br>selves and many Journeys we could take<br>so I attended an all-girls grammar<br>school and the Merchant Navy was<br>certainly not something my headmistress<br>thought was a good idea but I loved<br>maths and science I planned to be an<br>engineer and then an advert for BP<br>caught my eye and I had the opportunity<br>to go to a recruiting night where they<br>talked about the possibilities for a<br>career at Sea as either an engineer a<br>navigator or a radio officer<br>my father who came with me said oh can<br>we go now and I was like no I need to go<br>to the front and find out more about<br>this so I was accepted I'm very<br>fortunate but looking back some of those<br>possible selves that we think are open<br>to us are constrained by society that<br>possible self for me only came about<br>because the change in legislation just<br>before I left school that allowed girls<br>to go into that career so that<br>legislation<br>um<br>opened up lots of careers that<br>so I<br>very conscious of time so I'm going to<br>move quite quickly through the next bit<br>um I loved sailing around the world and<br>studying at South Shields marine and<br>Technical College<br>being on the ship I think has been<br>really useful training for everything<br>I've done since particularly running a<br>school<br>on the ships everyone's role was<br>important everyone was necessary it<br>didn't matter what you did all of those<br>jobs had to intersect with each other<br>also you had to be very resilient there<br>was no internet no phone in those days<br>once you sailed that was it if something<br>broke you had to fix it if there was a<br>problem you had to sort it out and so<br>that stayed with me I think through all<br>the jobs I've done<br>but then as a new mum once I got married<br>that career was no longer possible<br>so the thought was what to do next my<br>first step was becoming a family day<br>care provider while my daughter was<br>small because my husband was still away<br>at Sea I was really fortunate they<br>provided a one-year training course to<br>become a home-based educator<br>and that's where my fascination with<br>child development began<br>and then that continued through some<br>open University papers but then after a<br>few years of doing that the BP's Fleet<br>downsized my husband came ashore went to<br>University and I had to go out and and<br>earn much needed income so I did a<br>variety of things<br>um mostly in retail I won't go into all<br>the details of the other things but<br>tried lots of different things and then<br>we for pleasure I carried on studying<br>physics and maths at night class which<br>was my little bit of a treat for me<br>because I was having to do jobs that<br>were not so exciting and then in 1985 my<br>husband was recruited to come here so<br>the next big transition for us was<br>moving to New Zealand<br>and when I came here it was the<br>opportunity for me to rethink a career<br>option<br>and that's when I chose teaching so that<br>interest in child development was still<br>sitting there and so I enrolled in what<br>was in Hamilton Teachers College and we<br>were really fortunate to have Margaret<br>Carr and Helen may as our lecturers who<br>both went on to be professors<br>I put Victoria University on this slide<br>because it was a bit tricky weird to fit<br>it in later but my first full job which<br>actually came a bit later than this as a<br>lecturer was at Victoria University<br>um and Helen was leading the institute<br>for Early Childhood studies<br>Helen was instrumental in lighting my<br>fire for research<br>so one of the first pieces of research I<br>did as a teacher was exploring the block<br>corner and why children were not using<br>it in the way that I hoped and that<br>piece of research led me to move the<br>furniture change the resources and do<br>things differently so I already had this<br>interest in research and then the<br>opportunity we were at Hamilton Teachers<br>College at those days we said to come<br>down the hill and finish your degree at<br>University at the University of waikato<br>while I was doing that<br>my passions and my Pathways came<br>together<br>in a very exciting way for me<br>so when I enrolled as a an early<br>childhood student I chose mathematics as<br>my options subject to the confusion and<br>consternation of some why was an early<br>childhood teacher studying mathematics<br>at University level<br>but I persisted with it because as I've<br>said before that was one of the things I<br>really enjoyed<br>and then a job arose<br>as a researcher<br>on an early childhood mathematics<br>project<br>and so I applied with enthusiasm and was<br>very fortunate that Jenny gave me the<br>job<br>so that brought my interest together and<br>for many years now that research just<br>built on and built on to different<br>different areas of understanding<br>children's mathematics and lots of<br>opportunities to work with Ministry on<br>different um resources and so on from<br>there but what I want to acknowledge<br>here and this this lecture is about your<br>journey and what's influenced you on the<br>way was Jenny minted me into a world I<br>didn't know existed<br>she taught me the skills of running a<br>big project took me to conferences<br>introduced me to people gave me the<br>confidence to introduce myself to people<br>showed me about publishing and<br>encouraged me to pursue Masters and PhD<br>once I'd finished my degree<br>she also encouraged me to stick with the<br>and the challenge of juggling part-time<br>fixed term contracts around research and<br>teaching and all the things we do when<br>you're trying to start an academic<br>career while at the same time you've got<br>mortgage demands and other things that<br>that might lead you into a different job<br>that persistence paid off and as<br>research assistant and then project<br>officer you know we worked really hard<br>on trialling different things that made<br>a difference to children<br>and as I've already mentioned the<br>ministry picked up on many of those<br>things in my masters I carried on<br>studying<br>um<br>some of those ideas that we'd worked on<br>in the ministry projects would they work<br>as an independent person just in the<br>classroom by themselves without Ministry<br>funding and I explored that also with<br>seven-year-olds<br>I thought my PhD would continue the<br>maths theme<br>buying on what I what I knew most about<br>School accepted me into do<br>which I was really interested in the<br>what happens next the connection between<br>the learning in ECE which we've done a<br>lot of work on and what happens at<br>school which we'd also done a lot of<br>work on but how were children navigating<br>that move<br>when I got into the school I realized<br>that many people were more interested in<br>other aspects of the transition the<br>person with the passion for maths was me<br>and I could carry on with that theme or<br>I could rewrite the proposal and look at<br>something different so that's what I did<br>I decided to follow children from the<br>last year in kindergarten as their<br>families were deciding what school to go<br>to follow that pathway follow them into<br>school and explore the experiences of<br>both the parents the teachers the<br>children in that move through from ECE<br>so my PhD I called crossing the borders<br>it took me into this in-depth look at<br>Children's Learning Journeys<br>those of you familiar with Ron fembrino<br>will probably get the sense of proximal<br>processes going on there the the zigzag<br>is the child's Journey representing the<br>child's Journey where those immediate<br>interactions of child and environment<br>and the bigger arrows are meant to<br>represent those things that happen<br>around the child that they're not<br>directly involved in but shapes their<br>Journey<br>and then the weaving of the Friday key<br>in the background is just saying there's<br>so many other influences however in<br>depth I study we never quite capture<br>so the findings of that study really led<br>to me arguing that Children's Learning<br>Journey could be supported if we<br>understood what was happening for them<br>at the time the ministry was moving to a<br>seamless education and I thought that<br>might sound good in practice but my<br>research was showing that children<br>expected school to be a bit different<br>they could cope with change providing<br>they had the right information and<br>support<br>and I found that listening to Children<br>was key for one child they might be a<br>bit scared to use the school toilets and<br>that could really impact on their day<br>for other children they might be unhappy<br>because of what happened in the<br>playground others were really happy to<br>be at school and what was it about<br>school they were enjoying so I became<br>really fascinated in the many different<br>theoretical ways we could understand<br>this transition along with the Practical<br>information I was gaining<br>I can't go into all those theories here<br>but they are a source of delight I use<br>them a lot with my Master's students and<br>one I remember one student saying oh<br>it's so complex but it's beautiful it's<br>kind of what I still feel but I just<br>wanted to touch on one because I'll come<br>back to it later<br>so van Gannett was writing many years<br>ago but he wrote about transitions as<br>being on a threshold<br>that we could think about ourselves on a<br>lemon or a door you know the threshold<br>of a doorway between what was the old<br>and what's going to be the new and at<br>the moment of transition we're neither<br>part of the old or yet part of the new<br>and so what is it that actually helps us<br>to become incorporated into the new<br>some people are saying it's more like a<br>corridor than an immediate threshold<br>that transitions can take time<br>and we know that special rights of<br>Passage can sometimes help with the<br>transition we have ceremonies like<br>marriages and so on that can sometimes<br>help with the transition<br>so all this thinking and all this<br>studying led into oh sorry I thought I'd<br>drawn that one for you so that's just<br>what I was saying one of the things<br>that's really important for transitions<br>is just the physical move like a child<br>moving to school doesn't mean they've<br>yet reincorporated into the new role and<br>I watch children who could be quietly<br>disengaged not yet they're not yet<br>participating fully the children who cry<br>or complain we notice more but I was<br>very interested in those children that<br>we need to offer that bit more support<br>to<br>so those recommendations that I made led<br>to invitations by the ministry to come<br>and discuss this and from there Margaret<br>Carr and I were fortunate to have two<br>opportunities to do research projects<br>looking at the links between to Friday<br>key and the New Zealand curriculum<br>and at the time the oecd notion of key<br>competencies were shaping ideas around<br>what we should be doing in schools<br>education for the 21st century it was<br>talked about<br>so it was really exciting to explore<br>with teachers what this might mean in<br>practice what were the key competencies<br>what did they mean they aligned quite<br>nicely with the learning disposition<br>work that Margaret had been doing in ECE<br>and it led to changes or thinking about<br>changes to pedagogy and assessment and<br>thinking about how the curriculum<br>documents could align<br>the little one on the side<br>um was enough<br>why is that good it was an opportunity<br>to go to Australia with a take a group<br>of early childhood and and school<br>teachers on a Mini Bus Around<br>um some settings in Australia that<br>Professor Sue Dockett had organized for<br>us what I found from that one was<br>actually to get the best conversations<br>about ECE and school is to spend some<br>time sitting together in a minibus<br>driving around Australia<br>so I I just thought that one was too too<br>good anyway<br>um we were then part of the ministry<br>group talking about the the New Zealand<br>curriculum and we're excited to get this<br>alignment between the strands of<br>tafariki and the key competencies at<br>school<br>so that drawing many of you will be<br>familiar with is is from the school<br>curriculum document<br>however in practice once that was out<br>there and I was working with teachers<br>this is my own drawing of it is we had<br>to Friday key and we had the New Zealand<br>curriculum but that alignment took a lot<br>of work for teachers it wasn't a natural<br>progression from those strands of<br>tafariki into the key competencies at<br>school so I drew what I've called the<br>potential bridge between them it<br>provided a potential bridge but it<br>needed both sides to work at actually<br>at the same time mangere Bridge were<br>building on the work I'd done with my<br>thesis which as you'll remember was<br>called crossing the border and they did<br>an in-depth look at their own practices<br>and working with their local schools<br>there's too many findings to share all<br>of them here but two significant ones<br>were the use of the Early Childhood<br>portfolio at school so children taking<br>their Early Childhood portfolio to<br>school as a way for the new entrant<br>teacher to get to know them<br>and the second one that had a lasting<br>impact was buddies from the school<br>coming down to the Early Childhood<br>Center to work with a a preschool buddy<br>that was very effective the Buddies had<br>to put in CVS and apply and actually be<br>matched with a child a four-year-old<br>child they would come down they would<br>plan activities together and then when<br>it was time to go to school that school<br>child sometimes in one school it was a<br>year four and another school it was a<br>year five would show the family around<br>the school the families loved the the<br>child's eye view of the school and this<br>really supported the young children the<br>four-year-old starting school having a<br>big buddy that they knew they could call<br>on<br>that book there and the teachers were<br>the co-authors and it was a beginning<br>for me of writing with teachers<br>another significant piece of work and<br>still my most cited one was a literature<br>review that I did for the Ministry of<br>Education they were interested in what<br>makes a successful transition<br>and the review of the research at that<br>time there was sort of a sense certain<br>groups might be more or less successful<br>at school but the research was really<br>showing that it really depends on their<br>characteristics and what the school<br>context is offering so for any child<br>they could have a successful or less<br>successful transition<br>the key findings and themes from that<br>have been used<br>extensively and also for other<br>transitions I was told when the<br>Christchurch earthquakes happened in the<br>absence of other literature children<br>teachers were using these themes to<br>think about supporting children as they<br>they you know manage those earthquake<br>transitions<br>another significant<br>for me was the opportunity to go to<br>Australia<br>the invitation was for us to write<br>chapters for the book that I've shown<br>there and while we were there we we<br>worked together on a position statement<br>about transitions<br>the five<br>professors that are in the image<br>were very important because they were<br>planning to do some International<br>research I was only a senior lecturer at<br>the time but I was very fortunate they<br>took me under their wing and thought<br>that I could potentially lead the New<br>and I want to particularly acknowledge<br>Alain Wendy Dunlop who was one of those<br>professors<br>um she's been a friend I had met her at<br>conferences in the 2000s actually she<br>was there through those rough patches of<br>the PHD when you wonder why it's why<br>you're doing it at all and she was<br>encouraging and saying you know this<br>this is really good you need to keep<br>going we've done some writing and then<br>when this opportunity came up for a<br>Maori Curie project we actually all<br>stayed in her house by um the Icelandic<br>Professor didn't stay but the others of<br>us we stayed in her house and wrote this<br>proposal day and night until we got it<br>done<br>while I was there I'd been doing some<br>research here with Vanessa Parkey and I<br>was emailing and phone I think just<br>emailing in those days back to Vanessa<br>going do you think we could do this<br>together because we really wanted to<br>offer an indigenous research Focus for<br>part of the New Zealand arm of this<br>project<br>the first year we put it in it wasn't<br>successful but we got feedback and then<br>the second time it was successful and it<br>didn't support the New Zealand team but<br>because there was Maori Curie funding<br>for the Europeans we were able to get<br>oil Society funding to fund us so those<br>are the universities that were involved<br>it was four years it involved work<br>packages in each of the countries each<br>with its own theme and focus<br>which you might not be able to read from<br>a distance but you can see the interlock<br>inter-overlapping ideas and where we<br>so part of it was about strengthening<br>the long-term cooperation with Europe so<br>there was the finding of the research<br>but also getting to know each place and<br>the requirement was that you spent time<br>at the other universities not just a fly<br>and fly out like we do for conferences<br>so that chance to work and live in<br>another space was also really important<br>for my own research and my own thinking<br>and we hosted here twice<br>the indigenous approaches work package<br>we ran an indigenous conference as part<br>of that we had the the visitors here for<br>up to a month but a very successful<br>indigenous conference with I think every<br>Maori academic in our division at the<br>time was part of that and we had guest<br>speakers from elsewhere and then the<br>second one was on transition Journeys<br>where we looked particularly at<br>so it helped put us on the map<br>showcase the research that was happening<br>here which we were taking out to the<br>other countries but I think having more<br>people involved when we were here was<br>really important we had a writing<br>Retreat for two days over at Raglan and<br>that was the foundation of one of the<br>books that has come out of the poet<br>project<br>and at the same time there was further<br>research going on with teachers<br>um<br>thinking particularly about<br>curriculum and pedagogy here in New<br>Zealand<br>so I'm just going to skim through I'm<br>not going to go into detail about these<br>but there are a number of projects we<br>were fortunate enough to be part of<br>Karen Davis was another research partner<br>and she and I looked particularly at the<br>Children's thinking one of the things<br>that came out of that which was very<br>much about children's thinking in ECE<br>was it was only serendipitous when<br>sometimes a news a new entrant teacher<br>picked up on the ideas where new<br>children were passionate about so it led<br>us to thinking how could we make that a<br>more consistent experience for children<br>than the learning Journeys project which<br>I was working on with Vanessa<br>and I was fortunate to be part of Maggie<br>how hepa's work looking at kohanga Raya<br>tukura and then more recently a teacher<br>Innovation a teacher-led Innovation fund<br>working with Danny Burke where the new<br>entrant teachers and ECE teachers in<br>dannyberg put in a project that involved<br>every school and every ECE setting in<br>Danny work<br>they were originally told that's too big<br>for a teacher-led Innovation fund and<br>they said well that's fine we'll do it<br>anyway and we got the funding um<br>regardless and and kept it with that<br>very large project and it was fabulous<br>I don't think I'm going to read them all<br>actually you can probably be scanning<br>down those but I think one of the things<br>was really ECE centers taking a lot more<br>responsibility for that transition<br>sometimes in the past we'd found<br>teachers would say oh I think it's going<br>to be difficult but okay so what can we<br>do about that how can we help support<br>children the schools became much more<br>nuanced in their focus and what they<br>would do to support children<br>a lot more learning about children's<br>interests and competencies we had one<br>Maori medium setting going into an<br>English medium school as part of that<br>project and one of the things that was<br>really helpful for those children was<br>those ECE teachers doing a cultural<br>order of the resources so there were<br>familiar books and puzzles and things<br>when you got to school<br>and teachers developing cultural<br>with all of that research I was<br>fortunate to be part of the writing team<br>for tafatiki and be able to put that<br>the new or not so new now but the new<br>tafariq he had this image saying where<br>the two parts of the book meet you can<br>see the father key is unfinished with<br>the loose strand still to be woven in<br>and this acknowledges the child's<br>potential and their ongoing educational<br>Journey<br>so for me that was a very exciting<br>change it might not be so exciting to<br>you but it was really exciting to me<br>because it was recognizing that the new<br>learning could be woven onto tafariki we<br>didn't need a bridge we didn't need to<br>align you took what the child already<br>knew from ECE and you wove on the school<br>learning<br>and so there's a section in there<br>um<br>where the new there's a different<br>weaving pattern for tafariki in the 2017<br>version that symbolizes the start of a<br>journey that takes you Beyond the<br>Horizon<br>each of the principles links to the nzc<br>and the pathways section which I took<br>the major responsibility for I'm sure is<br>that continuity from school to Coulda<br>offering a place to start it doesn't say<br>it does everything but it's inviting<br>teachers in both sectors in to be<br>the other thing that that does was<br>recognize The Learning Journey as part<br>of everybody's responsibility it's<br>neither just the ECE teacher or the<br>primary school teacher it's everybody's<br>responsibility<br>and for the first time we had lots of<br>definitely Key Resources online and<br>that's just the one to do with Pathways<br>and transitions but there were many more<br>currently I'm part of as Neil said the<br>the curriculum voices project which is<br>um<br>considering and providing advice to the<br>ministry on all the changes that they're<br>going through with the the curriculum<br>refresh or somewhat more perhaps<br>development and my role particularly is<br>considering the ECE objectives and the<br>perspectives and how they're going to<br>connect to the school curriculum so<br>transitions again you know we're going<br>to have to see what the new tomato looks<br>like before we can see how we we make<br>those links there's a much more<br>consistency in how children are viewed<br>and some of the goals I think for<br>teachers are more similar<br>so I just wanted to move towards the end<br>of this with a reflection I think<br>individuals families institutions<br>societies they all experience transition<br>it's happening to all of us and it's all<br>around us<br>often those liminal situations are<br>transitory and temporary and a lot of my<br>work's been focused on how to support<br>people to move through this a lot of<br>what I've done with children I found is<br>absolutely applicable for our students<br>coming to University some of the ideas<br>about how we support people to make a<br>transition go across sectors and<br>settings but what if we can't complete<br>the transition lots of aspects of daily<br>life are full of change<br>there's been writing about something<br>called a lemon or hot spot where you're<br>stuck in the liminal space and you can't<br>actually move from that to make the<br>transition into the new experience the<br>sense of being trapped one writer writes<br>about it as your foot's on the pedal but<br>you're not in gear so people can burn<br>out with that as well so I think that's<br>a fruitful area for consideration a new<br>research<br>I want to just take a moment to<br>acknowledge and thank the many students<br>I've worked with over the years not all<br>of them have studied transitions but<br>some of those titles on there give you<br>the flavor of some who have<br>PhD students and master students and on<br>my on my Master's papers students have<br>taken studies at other transitions like<br>tutor to retirement or the loss of a<br>partner had a fabulous person one year<br>from the Solomons who was looking at how<br>you have to go off on a boat to<br>secondary school and what that might<br>mean very different to an experience<br>and just finally<br>um<br>we're very excited to nearly have<br>a Bloomsbury Handbook of Early Childhood<br>transitions published we're told early<br>next year this is a second book to come<br>out of the poet project it builds on and<br>expands from poet and but there's many<br>of the core writers that were part of<br>the poet original poet team from those<br>countries and we've<br>been fortunate to add in North American<br>perspectives as well with one of the one<br>of the editors and also some of the<br>authors<br>so it's very exciting<br>um we're really pleased to be able to<br>think about what next for transitions<br>research<br>so we've used Robert Frost's famous poem<br>there it circled me right back in my<br>Learning Journey back to school because<br>I really liked Robert Frost when I was<br>at school and his poem that posits that<br>the small choices we make every day have<br>can have big impacts on our lives the<br>decisions we make set us on a path we<br>might not understand the importance of<br>until much later and I've shared with<br>you some of the transitions I've made in<br>this book we've taken the Frost poem The<br>Road Not Taken to reflect on Research<br>Journeys in the field of early years<br>transitions<br>so many of the authors have<br>done what we do when we set out on a<br>project they've explained the decisions<br>they make the road that they chose and<br>why they chose it and what kinds of<br>results that led to<br>but in some of the other chapters of the<br>book we're looking to the future we<br>think this research area itself is at a<br>Crossroads with multiple possible paths<br>to travel when I was doing my PhD nobody<br>was looking at transitions<br>um to school in New Zealand then<br>suddenly quite a few people were and I<br>was thinking oh you know is that going<br>to be something that's too late but<br>actually it was the beginning of a<br>journey that's just grown and grown so<br>in the book we think about<br>um how we might make change with all of<br>this research also I think it might<br>change in the way that we understand<br>transitions change in the way that we<br>design and frame and Carry Out research<br>and change in the ways that our research<br>can benefit Society<br>so as part of this project we're really<br>daring to dream about the next steps<br>so I want to thank you very much thank<br>you very much for coming tonight thank<br>thank you all for coming once again but<br>thank you particularly to to Sally for a<br>fantastic talk<br>um lovely to see pictures of you uh<br>growing up<br>um I could have watched those for a<br>couple of hours they were they were<br>great<br>um and fantastic to hear about what is<br>an impressive body of work<br>um over a number of years I I did<br>calculate the number of years since you<br>were a student at waikato but I'm too<br>too polite to mention that number<br>um but it is a long-standing<br>um and<br>um well<br>to be congratulated level of service and<br>engagement with with this wonderful<br>University<br>I've got a few words to say<br>um to round off the evening and I will<br>really keep brief my comments on the<br>work that you've done<br>um I'm a as you know a psychologist but<br>I have dabbled sometimes in working<br>educational psychology<br>um Pro Vice Chancellor for Arts law<br>psychology and social sciences at the<br>moment<br>um acting Pro Vice Chancellor for<br>education I think I'm in my own liminal<br>hot spot at the moment in terms of that<br>transition whether I I<br>um when I leave for corridor I'll tell<br>you<br>um this is going to conclude the formal<br>part of the evening<br>um and I just want to let you know that<br>there will be an opportunity to ask<br>Sally questions<br>but you are banned from doing it in here<br>you have to accost her at the bar<br>outside<br>um that's the rules I don't make them<br>um look I think my impression hearing<br>you talk it just takes you back and I'm<br>sure it takes everybody here back to all<br>those times when we've experienced<br>transitions or when we've seen the<br>people we love our children and others<br>face Transitions and one of the most<br>stressful things you can do in your life<br>is to move house that's a different type<br>of transition and and just imagine you<br>thinking back to my own children and<br>myself<br>um the the stress as a parent of seeing<br>your first child go first to<br>kindergarten and then to school and then<br>to Secondary School<br>um transitions are hugely important<br>they're associated with academic<br>outcomes but also we know mental health<br>outcomes and I think it would be<br>particularly pertinent to look at that<br>in the higher education context given<br>what we know about the data there<br>um I see them as as all of the things<br>you've described<br>um just to give us some of my own<br>thoughts I I see them also as<br>threats opportunities and challenges in<br>terms of identity<br>um you're faced with a new context it's<br>about finding out who who you are and<br>how you fit in with other people and so<br>I think transitions are something that<br>are going to be increasingly important<br>in education but actually across<br>psychology as we look at transitions<br>across the lifespan so what an exciting<br>time to be studying that to be<br>understanding it and feeding into those<br>new discussions that are fundamentally<br>important to who we are how we feel and<br>where we're going I want to finally as<br>well rather than keep you any longer<br>thank Sally for her contribution for her<br>presentation I've known Sally since I've<br>been here but but only more closely<br>since uh well about three weeks isn't it<br>four weeks since coming over to<br>education and she's a wonderful<br>colleague a wonderful person to work<br>with uh intelligent<br>compassionate and an excellent leader as<br>well<br>um I thank you again for coming I thank<br>all of you for joining us<br>um we'll I'll leave it to Sally to let<br>you know whether she's happy or not to<br>answer your questions that is her<br>prerogative having given the<br>presentation but please may I ask you to<br>to join me in applauding once again a<br>fantastic contribution and achievement</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
