in order to give this<br>presentation please join me uh join with<br>me in welcoming Andrew to the Leon to<br>give his IPL intriguingly entitled<br>foundations foundations foundations<br>tanoto tanoto tanoto<br>C good evening U<br>welcome and thank you very much for<br>being here to celebrate my<br>achievements<br>so I have a couple of things first of<br>all the title and the way I'm going to<br>work on this<br>presentation is I took a cou couple of<br>weeks to try to decide what would be the<br>best title for for this achievement and<br>again foundations foundations<br>foundations I had to go through my Mai<br>um students uh to see as well with Sam<br>our associate Dean Mai to be able to<br>decide what was were the best words in<br>Mai to represent foundations as<br>such<br>and as I go through my presentation as<br>you can see there's one of my brothers<br>there two of them was Michael beside me<br>in the tricycle and my brother dougas<br>and the way I'm going to present this um<br>presentation I'm going to go through the<br>word foundations and why I'm using that<br>word um Anna Anna who kindly was<br>organizing this for us uh and for me uh<br>as well she gave me a little bit of an<br>outline of what should I do or what<br>other percentage ipls have gone through<br>the years and I am going to give a bit<br>of a history of bringing an<br>education and my career and my<br>achievements will be the end point of of<br>this presentation so with foundations<br>and the reason why I brought that<br>specifically from the mai would be faka<br>Papa that would be my ancestry my<br>upbringing the other point would be part<br>of my profession the support that I have<br>or the support that I have from the<br>tissues that I would like my speciality<br>supporting tissue oral health and that<br>be turanga waja and the other word food<br>foundations the last one will be and I<br>have my notes here too that will be<br>again the support that I have in in<br>relation to giving the Knowledge and<br>Skills to Future Professionals in oral<br>health so that's the reason why I use<br>the foundation so if I see from the<br>foundations I reive as a<br>childhood uh and you can see from the<br>slide that's me um is again the<br>encouragement of my parents and the<br>support that I got in an early childhood<br>and as I grow<br>up uh again and the part of the dental<br>treatment and my speciality is the<br>structure I see a lot of patients that<br>have lost<br>dentition uh without foundations you<br>won't be able to able to restablish<br>Health on on patient or restablish or<br>replace a tooth that has been lost and<br>last but not least and I think the most<br>important part we be in in ter education<br>would be<br>teaching teaching and educate future<br>professionals either on the grats po<br>grats all of them by one way or the<br>other we will influence future<br>professionals that service to the<br>important I think for Maria uh thank you<br>very much for all her support Maria my<br>wife um she's a talented illustrator or<br>artist and she has nicely given me<br>illustrations for my thesis for my<br>students my PO grats in a way that she<br>has supported me and again here within<br>this two illustrations that we have in<br>those side you have have the two main<br>areas of my research one would be the<br>supporting tissues of the teeth that we<br>have there and around implants I think<br>that's the gold standard of what we see<br>nowadays of the multiple use of implants<br>well so where I come from well I was<br>born in Columbia uh Khali I will give a<br>little bit of insight about the country<br>I think is important because it's a<br>different culture completely different<br>um and I was brought up mainly in bot I<br>maybe Liv in KH probably two three years<br>and after that I went to karakas to<br>Venezuela for another two<br>years at that time my father was working<br>specifically with Good Year and Herz and<br>as part of his CEO position he was<br>transferred to kakas during that<br>time Khali is um near the the valley is<br>R CAA<br>River um is between two main mountains<br>diandas uh and it's a valley and<br>Columbia usually as you see is in the<br>tip of South<br>America uh and the tip north of South<br>America just beside kakas or Venezuela<br>and<br>Panama uh we're in the equator that<br>means that we don't have the seasons<br>that we will have here uh it's a<br>tropical area but the only way you can<br>difference in temperature or or or would<br>say if it's cold or it's warm is going<br>up or down the hill that means you can<br>get a Perman 40 or 50 Dees if you go all<br>the way down or you can get really cold<br>if you go further<br>up the good thing about Colombia is that<br>it's very rich<br>biodiverse uh I think it's the second<br>biodiverse country in the<br>world uh I miss the fruits of course<br>because that's something that we have<br>plenty of that and those photographs<br>that you see there are the photographs<br>of a shop where you can a grocery shop<br>that you can buy all the foods that you<br>want uh the bio ver and we have the<br>Amazon on the south and we'll have<br>borders with again uh Brazil we have the<br>Amazon as well and we have the jungles<br>and rainforest that we have in deserts<br>country k um it's the third largest city<br>in<br>Columbia uh if you see the two images as<br>I go through the top on your<br>left that's the city center uh that's<br>the church that<br>Lita the river crosses the city it's a<br>city of roughly 2 thou<br>2,300 uh population wise altitude is a<br>th000 meters about Fe level and as you<br>know probably the ones that have been my<br>students undergrad that I see up there I<br>like to dance I I like to do salsa and<br>the reason why is because Khali is the<br>city the SAA capital of the world and<br>that's something that is interesting<br>because being a Colombian that I<br>am um I think that we are born in that<br>way that we celebrate with dancing every<br>event any birthday it's always dancing<br>so that's something that you will see<br>why the other image that you see there<br>is the municipal theater down on the<br>bottom and that is um in when Ina and<br>again you will see a little bit of the<br>influence of maybe Europeans because we<br>were colonized by<br>Spanish as you can see again uh this is<br>like what we have in brail the<br>fedia uh where they<br>have they do the dancing as<br>well now bot so Bogota I moved in bogot<br>Ric when I was 60 years of<br>age uh is the capital of Columbia it's a<br>financial hop it's around almost 8<br>million inhabitants there uh but the<br>temperature is base again is cold I<br>would say average temperature is 14° and<br>the reason behind it is quite high in<br>altitude it's<br>2640 m above sea<br>level um it's very<br>busy uh we have as you can see Financial<br>Center on the top of the middle and in<br>the middle specifically you have again<br>the colonial old city so we have what we<br>call the<br>Candelaria and has a lot of influence of<br>Spanish as you can go anyone who has<br>gone to Spain you will see again the<br>tiles and all the structures and<br>buildings are very Colonial and if you<br>go all around Columbia you will see that<br>architecture now this is the second part<br>of my talk and then is again the way I<br>was brought up and as I mentioned before<br>I was born in Khali and then moved to<br>kakas at that time we were living that's<br>a penous that we live in one of the<br>maybe few buildings that were a four<br>storage building at that<br>time uh a little bit of uh history<br>that's my my fo's name Andrew Albert<br>tsmith<br>aludo now maybe like Mai we have the way<br>we were colonized in 1400s 1500 so we<br>have a lot of history behind and the<br>only way we can track our an ancestors<br>is that we when we got married or<br>anything we use both the father's and<br>the mother's Ser name and we add that to<br>your birth certificate so in my case Cas<br>will be TOS Smith because TOS is my<br>grandparents<br>side and my mother's my grandmother's<br>side is a Smith so I think I don't know<br>why they borrow that<br>name from my mother's side aludo so my<br>ancestry will have my grandfather was<br>from<br>Scotland my father was British was<br>English and my grandmother was from<br>Liverpool from my mother's side I have<br>Basque that means Spanish side and my<br>grandfather was Spanish my grandmother<br>was<br>Colombian so I have a little bit of a<br>mixture of European and Colombian<br>descent my mother's surname is aluru and<br>if I put another surname from My<br>Father's Side it will be<br>court and as I go then my mother's side<br>will be a fador so I have more surnames<br>that I could add to this history or this<br>type of Journey I would say or my<br>ancestry and that's the way that in<br>Colombia we do that and usually it's the<br>father's first and then the mothers<br>completely might be different to the<br>Brazilians that will put the mother<br>surname<br>first so we are a family of four four<br>siblings um strangly my parents my dad<br>was more in engineering he was more in<br>in oil<br>who work constructing uh pipelines in<br>jungles to bring the oil out to be a be<br>able to process in other areas in other<br>countries my mother was an educator more<br>into childhood early childhood and four<br>brothers none of them in the area of<br>engineering but all of them in the area<br>of health so my eldest is and again<br>we're not names are are usually more<br>British not Colombian as probably this<br>I'm not ramz I'm not Alberto but again<br>the names were a bit unusual being in<br>Columbia because I always was named with<br>Andre so different names they couldn't<br>pronounce TOS Smith but only Smith so I<br>always have issues with my surname as I<br>as as my during my high school or my my<br>my<br>education my brother the eldest was a<br>pediatrician uh the second was a prad<br>dantist I'm the third one<br>and the last one is an eye surgeon so as<br>you can see um all of V Health<br>Sciences uh I had a very good ear early<br>childhood and and I brought up with all<br>the<br>support uh a lot of gaming a lot of um I<br>would say influence into Sport and my<br>parents were like in a way pushing me to<br>do more Sport and not lying down in bed<br>all day long and we had to be almost up<br>at 8:00 a.m. because they thought that<br>probably that would be a very good<br>influence for me and I think that it<br>help me a lot because I have a ro of<br>influence on my sports as<br>well in the second column uh second<br>image that's my<br>that uh and you can see I least you<br>recognize I'm the one with the stripes<br>here I'm the one here I'm not sure if<br>I'm picking my nose or what I'm doing<br>there and with the other one I like<br>Outdoors as you can see from my camping<br>and my dad here with my grandmother Mar<br>God and my youngest brother Douglas and<br>me as well with my beautiful hat that I<br>time we shifted to Colombia and then I<br>start my primary school in<br>Columbia at that time not it's not like<br>here and you say that you start at 5 you<br>start at 6 and I was left I'm still<br>left-handed but the issue here is that<br>even the photograph graer when they took<br>that image they put the pen and still<br>remember that there on the right hand<br>and I thought what the heck what's<br>happening here and I can recall if I<br>recall all my students that I have here<br>how many of you will be left-handed how<br>many of them they will<br>struggle in the clinics trying to treat<br>patients as a<br>left-handed sadly we still have<br>situations with left-handed like I am<br>trying to get even sissors for<br>left-handed people so that's an issue<br>because during my my education I have<br>some issues as a primary as a<br>student not strange I would say I<br>struggle with my primary and high school<br>education and the reason why might be I<br>can say I was slightly hyperactive might<br>be um discipline wise uh or a lot of the<br>reports that I have if I can show you<br>all the scans of all my report<br>cards uh they are not that positive<br>there was was a lot of Reds at that time<br>um if I pass any year completely with I<br>pass all the subjects was a<br>surprise uh and usually I had to<br>remediate and stay during my holidays<br>and getting remediation to pass to next<br>year it's not like that here that<br>probably you fail and you can carry on<br>in Colombia 5 failed a subject you had<br>to repeat or you have to remediate so I<br>have to remediate a lot so that's<br>something that it was uncommon but that<br>happened a<br>lot uh but as I put down there they I<br>think with my parenting and the guidance<br>I got received from my parents and this<br>support as I I went through my education<br>that helped me a lot to succeed and at<br>least to graduate from high<br>school that's something that you didn't<br>know uh in the last image um we're<br>Catholics yes we're Catholics we we were<br>brought up in a cathol Catholic country<br>and I went to a school the s caros<br>school and in the next slide you will<br>see the school that I went uh was<br>Benedict priest and they enforced<br>discipline that we call probably today<br>would be an abuse because they enforce<br>really that discipline on that school I<br>had a lot of um as I told you I have<br>siblings that I also had a lot of<br>sisters so I had sister Edwin Sister<br>Margaret Anne sister auma and sister Jud<br>that to I can remember in each of the<br>years that each of them were the heads<br>of that year and clearly they enforc<br>discipline quite hard and that's in the<br>acceptable um if I put there uh that's<br>me<br>1970s and you can see again in 1974 and<br>8s I on purpose I put the a little bit<br>of the scans of the report cards that I<br>have there and I translated this one<br>Andrew hron has improved however in all<br>other aspect he's doing really bad so I<br>put that one<br>in and if you see the one at the bottom<br>says that he has to improve<br>discipline and issues again with my<br>hyperactive situation I didn't stay put<br>so I I had I really had to do it hard<br>but again with my parents and my<br>Guidance the guidance that I received<br>from my parents and my probably teaches<br>some of them influen me in the right way<br>I managed to go in the right<br>direction I learn about about discipline<br>and as I grew<br>sports now in sports I think that I've<br>enjoyed a lot and I cannot say that it's<br>bad but it's good because in one way or<br>the other it gave me celf<br>discipline I think that I in one way<br>succeeded quite well in the way what I<br>did the other aspect that I think that<br>was quite positive for me is that I met<br>Maria and my wife at that time and I<br>think I'll show show you one of the<br>images here that was quite funny in 19<br>1981 I think that's we met at that time<br>and she went because the two brother and<br>sister their brother and sister my<br>brother-in-law and sister-in-law they<br>were<br>swimmers so um as you know I had hair<br>before as I had hair and you can see<br>there the one with the beautiful Speedo<br>I I can see there with my hairs and my<br>gogles I did competitive swimming and I<br>still swim a lot and everyone knows I'm<br>being at least lucky to be involved in<br>the den review for two years in a<br>row and as you can see from the top on<br>your right a lot of prices that I won<br>during my competitive<br>years<br>and at least I think that gave me and<br>today gave me<br>well-being uh physically and mentally<br>because I think that gives me a little<br>bit of a balance in the way of what I do<br>school graduated in<br>1981 uh you can see with my brother my<br>brother is roughly 14 months older than<br>younger than me but he catch up because<br>I failed a year so I had to repeat a<br>year so I had always him beside me and<br>everything and that was helpful because<br>that encouraged me to study a bit then<br>the second image that you have is Maria<br>and me we've known each other since 1981<br>so it's quite a lot of years and she<br>knows me with hair and without<br>good after I graduated uh I didn't know<br>what to study it's not that I decided to<br>go into Dentistry<br>immediately um probably I want to do<br>marine<br>biology and I had a little bit of an<br>influence of my dad saying You Have To<br>Be Your Own Boss probably you need to do<br>something that you get get to money and<br>at that time I hadn't decided anything<br>so what I did I went to they send me to<br>another University in balanga that is a<br>smaller City it's still like 26° average<br>temperature and I did six months of<br>Health Sciences there before I went into<br>Dentistry at the Columbia School of<br>Dentistry in Bogota<br>uh completely surprisingly differently<br>and my performance were extremely good<br>so instead of being always in the last<br>as a high school<br>student I won the price of the second<br>best student among<br>240 it might be that that that motivated<br>me to do better uh and I think that was<br>incredibly good for me and I achieved<br>quite good results from<br>that in Columbia when you graduate as a<br>dentist you cannot work immediately so<br>you need to go specifically and do a<br>social service for the government and<br>the options that you have there either<br>you go Columbia is very insecure sides<br>where you have Rebels gorilla groups and<br>if you go to a Red Zone you do six<br>months of service if you not then you go<br>for a year of service before you can get<br>your license so at that time I did my uh<br>whatever s service for the government<br>specifically with the coffee gr<br>Committee of kundina Mara that is the<br>department with Bogota and it's the<br>coffee growing area that is all around<br>that area that is not well developed in<br>some of the areas and I was the head of<br>the mobile unit for the oral health<br>services and the way we work there is<br>only two weeks you on on call that means<br>you go for 15 days and that is quite<br>quite heavy work and after that you have<br>a whole week of of free to stay at home<br>or work and at that time I did dental<br>practice as well and in my own practice<br>in in bot at the same<br>time when I finished this um those that<br>are from 1960s they will understand when<br>you apply for a possession and you're<br>looking for your postgrad<br>education then you start sending letters<br>because we didn't have the internet<br>forget about the online so you write<br>letters letters letters and I can recall<br>that I've sent at least 40 letters and I<br>think again<br>self-driven is how you well you perceive<br>your education and how well you want to<br>achieve what do you want to achieve in<br>the future and I think the way I my<br>parents encouraged me and they told me<br>and they gave me all the support and<br>they told me if you want to succeed<br>depends on you how you drive your<br>profession and your studies and what I<br>did at that time I apply all around the<br>world and I got the two options of<br>either going to guys in London or in<br>Glasgow so I initiated and I went to<br>Glasgow at that time started oral<br>surgery and being in Glasgow I met John<br>Lindy went and he is from gothenberg he<br>was the head of p onology and the dean<br>of gothenberg University and he went to<br>give a continuous education course in<br>Glasgow and at that<br>time um I went to visit while I was<br>studying surgery I went to visit gamberg<br>and again with the support of my dad<br>because financially always he was giv me<br>all the support then I went and I<br>shifted to do my career again in gber as<br>a result of that visit from go from John<br>Lindsay<br>at that time also I had a chat with<br>Dennis Kain Dennis Kain was still in in<br>in glaso at that time and he did some<br>comments in relation that whatever was<br>doing in oral surgery I would we be one<br>of the others because Dennis can said<br>well whoever is the head of surgery or<br>of oral surgery in Glasgow never will<br>have the same level of what you can<br>achieve with John linday so you have to<br>think very wisely if you want to stay<br>here you want to or you want to move to<br>to gothamberg so I had the opportunity<br>to move to gothamberg and that's where<br>you see the last column in 1989 to<br>1992 gothamberg was interesting uh for<br>me uh I had really good time in Glasgow<br>I finished I remember my first year and<br>when I got the results I passed my<br>letter of I would say resignation saying<br>that I'm moving out I wanted to pass the<br>year uh and have a successful year<br>before I<br>shifted uh and gothamberg again being a<br>Scandinavian country was completely<br>different and it was interesting in a<br>way because um first of all uh patients<br>were Swedish so we had to go into on a<br>Thursday evening to Swedish<br>classes and I learned as you can see<br>three lines here<br>specifically humu is how are<br>you y Ina don't speak<br>Swedish I can remember that and Coca and<br>a smos say a Coke and sandwich<br>please so those if you know those three<br>lines I think that's interesting because<br>at least you can go around Sweden but<br>the good thing is the Swedish they are<br>very bilingual and they all speak very<br>good English as<br>well gothenberg was a good experience<br>this is my cohort<br>1982 there's a Turkish the Colombian a<br>Mexican lady feos who is the Greek and<br>Nani is a<br>Brazilian all of us we were the second<br>cohort for gothenberg on in this<br>postgraduate program my mentors were<br>really good I I cannot complain about<br>that because the mentors gave me all the<br>support all the knowledge that I have<br>and I looking at my post<br>grats um John Lind he he never Smiles<br>but but that's fine uh as you can see<br>and the not the ones who are in my field<br>know who is John Lindy and everyone a<br>lot of you have probably studied from<br>John lind's<br>textbook the one on the bottom is anyone<br>that talks about regeneration GTR got a<br>tissue regeneration is his student Iman<br>so I had again student Iman as one of my<br>lecturers and key mentors as well as<br>well of John<br>goler and I have from the end of I've at<br>Lara I had gunar Beren hold and if I see<br>my proston I had down on the back there<br>is gunar Carlson as well so we had this<br>program usually the specialist program<br>we have to rotate each three year three<br>months we had to rotate in different<br>specialities so that was really good<br>because I had an input from Tander<br>Orthodontics uh vents as well let home<br>from oral surgery and my my basic<br>training specifically and implant was in<br>Browner Mar clinic so I had the chance<br>to go into the Browner Mar clinic for<br>several years to do all my treatments in<br>related now almost at the end now uh for<br>my upbringing I married with Maria 1980<br>1995 825<br>925 uh after a long pronounce<br>relationship<br>and the reason why we took a little bit<br>longer is I wanted Maria Maria is a<br>physician she's a psychiatrist but she's<br>not at the moment working but she's<br>doing Arts<br>now and um it was really good for us U<br>then newly married um part of the<br>Scandinavian I was part of the member of<br>the Scandinavian society and at that<br>time there was a<br>newsletter and in that newsletter I<br>remember there's skate sponsor lecture<br>posession and I said to Maria I remember<br>we were in the flat I said should I<br>apply for this possession and she said<br>okay why not it was more an adventure<br>and we got it I I came here for<br>interview the only thing I remember was<br>freezing like<br>hell uh even there was I can't remember<br>when it was but but I want to thank<br>again Angelo pack and at that time even<br>war was here and I nice to see doc as<br>well doc hobber was here as well and it<br>was interesting because<br>um it's a big I remember that time the<br>university provided for that for those<br>short listed for for the interview<br>nowadays we do everything by<br>zoom and that was my first visit to to<br>New Zealand uh and again I came for the<br>interview and at that time if I recall<br>well the other one show listed was<br>Jonathan<br>lighter and those that know Jonathan it<br>was there but at least I was successful<br>on the interview and I got the position<br>so I came here in<br>1998 and you can see there Warick Angela<br>and the the bottom and Le Jen that sadly<br>pass away and again without um Angela<br>pack I wouldn't be here because I guess<br>that she recommended me that I should<br>apply for uh Visa through<br>skills and that's the reason where<br>sooner or later I got my citizenship and<br>my New Zealand citizenship and passport<br>as well so that means<br>that thanks for Angela uh I guess I<br>guess I I I succeeded to be a<br>professional in New<br>Zealand now last part of this would be<br>again Camila so Camila if the ones that<br>the camil is<br>adopted<br>um 2004 born in 2004 I always forget<br>February and uh for us was good because<br>we decided with Maria that we wanted to<br>ad and start of going through all the<br>processes of all the all the aspects in<br>relation to the medical treatment and we<br>decided not to go that way and we<br>decided to go for adoption and I think<br>that was a really good decision for us<br>camil has been a blessing and it was a<br>blessing for us and thanks again uh<br>she's always on top of me for<br>everything uh we enjoy her joy and I<br>think that she's given us the chance to<br>be parents<br>um she's very<br>funny and thanks again for all the<br>support and Maria again the same thing<br>we've had a wonderful life very<br>supportive loveling uh lovely uh family<br>as<br>well we and sorry I forgot something I<br>stayed in New Zealand for the first time<br>from 1998 to 2002 went back and work<br>back to the Columbus school of v histry<br>and in the Columbus school of v hisry We<br>stay until 2009 when I got we got<br>Camila uh with Camila we decided I was<br>commuting too much I was doing too much<br>work usually the in Columbia I was<br>working half timee as a as a academic<br>and halftime private practice and that<br>means that I was finishing at 7:8<br>p.m. and I started at 7:00 a.m. till 12:<br>so it was a long days and I was starting<br>to do commuting and it was too much for<br>me and for Maria as well and at the end<br>we decided that the best way to bring up<br>Camila was to come back to New Zealand<br>and we appli for the position that time<br>was Greg Simo the dean I remember that<br>the interview panel was war and was Greg<br>and uh a new position came for the<br>senior lecture position but at the same<br>time another position came out in<br>relation to create our bridging program<br>for the new program for the IMU and I<br>got a call from Greg specifically saying<br>that yes you got short listed for the<br>period position however there's a new<br>role that I would like you to take on<br>and that was to create the IM program<br>for the IMU tole articulation program<br>that's the reason why then I got that<br>position in 2009 and came in 2009 back<br>to New<br>Zealand here Carol you hear uh Carol's<br>been our mother in a way uh Angry Hugh<br>as well sadly Hugh passed away but Hugh<br>and Carol have given us all the support<br>Carol has been the grandmother for<br>Camila and I want to thank you again for<br>all your support that youve given us<br>years we've done a lot of trips I think<br>Camila has been has been almost around<br>the world traveling with us all the time<br>it's probably she's a little bit spoil<br>but that's<br>fine and uh we we enjoy life and I think<br>that's I think that's a message and I<br>know the people that know me I've had<br>some medical issues before throughout my<br>my my journey and that's have given me a<br>different perspective of life and I<br>go now I wouldn't say the boring part<br>but but it's an interesting one career<br>and achievements and uh I think this<br>journey is a team approach I I want to<br>thank war that is here and the reason<br>why is because to succeed you need to<br>team up and one way that you do it is um<br>by supporting each other by working<br>together for a common aim and for me<br>that's<br>important um the first journey that I<br>had in research uh being in a third<br>world country that is<br>Colombia there's things that you need to<br>think about first of all Columbia<br>doesn't have the grants that you can get<br>here or another more developed countries<br>there's other priorities and other<br>things that you need to work on so my<br>research is more into the area of<br>implants and more in relation I think is<br>a journey that you go as a clinici one<br>is to prove that you can do better<br>sometimes you want to place the implants<br>to replace teeth and you want to be<br>predictable and you can yeah you can<br>probably you can screw whatever you want<br>to screw but if it's titanium you<br>there's a lot of brands that will stick<br>to Bone one way or the<br>other and the gold standard nowadays to<br>replace a tooth if the dation is good<br>it's in a very good condition then what<br>you need to do is at least you put a<br>titanium screw to be able to again<br>create the foundation to be able to<br>treat and to reestablish at least re<br>build that crown that you're going to<br>put on top the areas are been working<br>more as impartial dentes over the<br>Adventures uh if I summarize there I<br>would say mandul over the Dentures<br>either with two three implants for the<br>maxilla and removal partial dentes on<br>purpose I didn't put the single tool<br>replacement because I was not part of<br>that<br>research but and here again I need to PR<br>this Photograph that you'll see here the<br>group and if you can see there Alan pay<br>is in the middle you have Rohana on your<br>right side<br>you have<br>Warick on your right Anna that is still<br>working with us uh you have Mari on your<br>left side and you have Paul Pierce where<br>is<br>Paul Paul and J Egan and Diane Campbell<br>on your<br>right and all of them were part of that<br>clinical over D research project and<br>that's the reason you have the Corp and<br>that was the first research group that<br>we had investig ating again implant<br>supported over<br>Ventures uh we treated a lot of patients<br>and last but not least is sanan ma<br>because San ma came later when she<br>graduated and she did the dent clean<br>Dent is specifically doing bone level<br>measurements around this patients that<br>were treated by us at that time and she<br>did followup of 10 years followup of<br>patients and the the reason we did this<br>researcher was trying to look for a<br>standard of treatment usually when we<br>treat patients that were fully dentulous<br>they maybe use five six implants with<br>reconstructions that were fixed very<br>expensive and in addition to that we<br>wanted to see if we could load the<br>implants in an early phase that means<br>usually when we put implants we wait for<br>3 to six months and there's other things<br>that you need to do is either you<br>submerge and then you connect the<br>implant to the oral cavity that that's<br>one option that is called a two-stage<br>approach or the other one is a one-<br>stage surgery that means that you<br>connect the implants directly and you<br>can see them in the mouth the same day<br>that you place them you can see them<br>through the mucosa coming<br>through uh there was need of additional<br>trials to measure that there was a need<br>to modify the techniques that we did for<br>Implant placement to be able to measure<br>the different loadings that we want to<br>do on<br>patients so that's what we did and what<br>you see here again in the surgical<br>approach was trying to measure again<br>there were more than 100 patients that<br>were treated for<br>this um there patients that were entous<br>for many years but some of them for 30<br>years uh age population some of them<br>were quite elderly some of them have<br>died already and some of you like<br>probably William has treated one of them<br>that been already restored for more than<br>20<br>years and we did the follow up of more<br>than 10 years for this patients and we<br>measure different loadings I'm not going<br>to go into go into detail but it was<br>very successful in a way that we proved<br>that we can minimize the cost for the<br>patients you can restablish health and<br>function for those patients with two<br>implants and that was considered now<br>what we call the Mel consensus and we're<br>part of that Mel consensus and I'll show<br>that in one of the two slides further<br>on a lot of Publications came out from<br>there and you can see one the first one<br>there on your left side would be where<br>we modify implants that were originally<br>to be submerged to do them as a<br>one-stage surgery that means completely<br>exposed after the surgery you can see<br>them through the<br>mcosa and then we decided to go<br>specifically on different loadings early<br>loadings at six weeks or two weeks and<br>then we proved that the success criteria<br>success or predictability of the<br>treatment that we did for those s sites<br>were equally or similar to what we had<br>with the normal loading time for those<br>patients this is part of the consensus<br>and again Publications came out on that<br>consensus on all those journals that you<br>have down there it's specifically that's<br>the standard of care for an dentulous<br>Mand will be be uh implant supported<br>over D with two unsplit implants with<br>Dentures additional to that then we<br>extended our research and I say our<br>research because it's is a<br>team uh and again we did maxillary three<br>implants uh very resor rich we use<br>implants of 325 in diameter in some of<br>the cases we use osto as<br>well and here the standard if we go from<br>the pronic point of view was trying to<br>go from a fixed restoration to a<br>removable one the second part that you<br>see there is to extend the treatment<br>protocols and we did a multicenter study<br>again with removal partial dentures<br>trying to put again two distal implants<br>with the B the with the matrices again<br>on the region of the sixes is again to<br>improve retention of those Danes as<br>well uh at that time I was part of the<br>Multi Center but I was shifted in<br>Colombia and I did all the surgical<br>aspect I was the the head for the<br>surgical aspect and pronic aspect in<br>time we got uh chapters in books that<br>there was quite good because they<br>recognized the quality of the research<br>that we did we were part of the ITI<br>treatment guide and we were recognized<br>by the ITI the stromman teams in<br>relation to what the quality and a<br>standard of care for evangelous patients<br>that we had<br>there now after that um one of the<br>things that happened is that of course<br>we were placing more and more<br>impant and we started to get um more<br>complications as you see at 10 years<br>later then you'll see more complications<br>and complications and I was trying to<br>treat those complications but what I<br>read was not enough for me I was trying<br>to laser them I was trying to try and<br>correct infections around the implants<br>but when we did that uh those<br>complications<br>a lot of the treatments were transferred<br>from natural dentici perum to preimplant<br>tissues so we use the same diagnostic a<br>that we use in in around teeth to treat<br>a surface that is<br>titanium then we have a surface that is<br>roughen it's not smooth we have<br>geometrically we have a threaded<br>surface and nowadays we modify the<br>surface to be more roughen so it's very<br>difficult to treat an infection around<br>an implant and infection around implants<br>they spread much more rapidly than<br>natural dention so all my second part of<br>the research would it was more derived<br>on how to decontaminate the surface and<br>the other aspect was more related with<br>uh to understand the diagnosis of the<br>disease and what causes bone loss around<br>impants and that's the research that I'm<br>doing at the<br>moment um my thesis was more related<br>again what was my main<br>supervisor is was the origin and<br>presence of titanium particles in<br>up the management is still extremely<br>difficult um there is no gold standard<br>um I see that whatever we do we modify<br>the surface of the implants have we the<br>treatment and a lot of the Publications<br>come in relation to the modality of<br>treatments that we're trying to do and<br>again to search a question an answer<br>that I need to ask is how should I treat<br>this infections around patients that<br>still don't have the<br>answer so one of the things that we did<br>and we did with this study with uh wari<br>is specifically we were one of the first<br>groups that bring the use of normal<br>toothbrushes and see the efficacy of<br>those toothbrushes around patients that<br>had lost in tition for many years and<br>you need to reestablish the the the<br>habit of oral hene around implants<br>because we recognize that those<br>infections are plaque driven by bofilm<br>and we needed to know the mechanically<br>we need to remove to maintain the health<br>of those sites so I did Publications in<br>relation to lasers preimplant<br>diseases uh in addition to that other<br>Publications came out in relation to why<br>does the titanium deteriorates or<br>particulate titanium where is it coming<br>from again uh key members I think of the<br>research Heisel Heisel is a kindly<br>friend that we've worked really hard<br>together in relation to<br>theology uh the immune the host response<br>to those uh particles that we have in<br>the area M moment was also my student<br>but moment again has kindly worked and<br>collaborated with us very hard and again<br>San M that is very very pivotal Allison<br>again for all the pathology and War that<br>is again has given me guidance<br>throughout my career as well so all of<br>this at the end gave me the chance if I<br>had to do my research that I was doing<br>it at least I Consolidated all this<br>research and I did my PhD at that time<br>and that's the day when I handed in my<br>beautiful thesis into that room that you<br>have at the clock tower at the at the<br>basement I decided I managed to gr<br>biofilms I have Malcolm here that with<br>on the icpms and thank you Malcolm for<br>all your support that you given me<br>throughout some of the research we've<br>done uh we measuring the leakage of<br>titanium in liquids uh and rining<br>solutions uh and to see the leakage of<br>that titanium if you go with an<br>ultrasonic device if you go with<br>different type of modalities of<br>decontaminated the surface what created<br>that problem and if that leakage will<br>exacerbate or enhance the house reaction<br>immune reaction to that as a foreign<br>body as well to create that bone loss<br>around the<br>implants more studies in relation of<br>reective approaches of with<br>implantoplasty the effect of the normal<br>mechanical procedures that we've done<br>around implants and what is the effect<br>on the surfaces as well and I had the<br>chance to evaluate if there is any type<br>of leakage of Titanium by normal wear<br>and tear between the structure the crown<br>and the implant as well so I study that<br>and that research specifically I want a<br>price on that area I did some images<br>again confocal microscopy SC to evaluate<br>the surface deterioration around<br>implants uh I found particles very<br>frequently around implants even if the<br>implants were untouch by mechanical<br>treatment so where is that titanium<br>coming from that's one of the issues<br>that we need to answer as<br>well more Publications and I guess I<br>think I would like to thank car for this<br>because at least I remember when you<br>asked me if I was interested to be<br>writing a chapter for this book of<br>fundamentals of Implant Dentistry and at<br>least that recognizes me in a way that I<br>know that what I'm do in the clinic is<br>biologically driven and it's proven in a<br>way that I'm not guessing or trying to<br>work a treatment that is not being at<br>least tested and proven that is reliable<br>in a<br>way the word that I got L for that my<br>research in in Implant Dentistry is<br>specifically clar Mish the ones that<br>know the literature is an American um<br>researcher in the field of<br>implantology and was more again in<br>relation to the wear and presence of<br>particles as a r as a result of wear and<br>function on sironia crowns and titanium<br>implants as well last but not least and<br>I think I've seen there Hana and I want<br>to thank Hana because we're doing a dig<br>digal uh dentist collaboration<br>multicenters study more in Dental<br>education and here we have kolinska<br>Institute we have naggi uh basini I have<br>Nichols and Sebastian<br>malist from kolinska we have from uh Al<br>education in London uh Fiona Clark we<br>have renilde Jacobs and V tar from Len<br>Belgium and from otago have Sam Sam<br>carington Hannah Hannah is the leader<br>and I always like to recognize that and<br>myself and what we're doing here we're<br>creating a virtual tool and this is a<br>result probably as Co came in uh now<br>education we're going in a hybrid<br>situation that a lot of students like to<br>do online everything is online and they<br>like to do lectures online everything is<br>recorded and we've been gone I think<br>denti has changed significantly<br>digitally uh technology have helped us a<br>lot and the tendency and education tools<br>and is has changed a lot as well and<br>this is more to enhance and see how we<br>can improve the education for our<br>students uh this virtual tool is four<br>main areas one is patient examination<br>greeting int exal examination and this<br>for B and BDS students year two and year<br>one and it's going to be again Global<br>because it's going to be probably<br>standard it also includes um periodontal<br>examination it includes um local<br>anesthesia and dental radiography for<br>students are the achievements I think<br>that um Paul has recognized all those<br>achievements that I've received uh<br>throughout my years if I go and I try<br>and summarize all of them it will take<br>me a couple of hours probably but main<br>achievement for me and challenging that<br>it was to create a journal for the<br>dental faculty of dentists in<br>Columbia and I was a scientific director<br>of that journal and I had to build that<br>journal from scratch and I think that<br>was quite interesting for me it was<br>really an achievement that I think was<br>uh PR successful for me and for the<br>University as well from this side I have<br>to recognize Greg because Greg gave me<br>the chance to do the IMU bridging<br>program I spent a whole year trying to<br>create this program to bring the IMU<br>students into tago and that was<br>interesting for me because it was the<br>first Challenge in a bridging program<br>that I need to create for Foreigner<br>dentist or future<br>dentist uh as well I will recognize<br>Allison and and and Carl because both<br>were Deputy Deans when GRE left and I'm<br>going chronologically as you can see I<br>put the photograph that way and the<br>reason why I did this in again is<br>because they encouraged me to do best<br>and to very very supportive<br>so the bridging program is that image<br>that you see there uh we started this um<br>articulation program 2010 we've had more<br>than 140 graduates and we have nowadays<br>probably three post grats from ru and I<br>think that means that the quality of<br>what we receive and what we get of<br>influence of international students to<br>the community is extremely relevant and<br>I think we need to recogn ize that and I<br>thank those students are coming for<br>that with encouragement of Allison again<br>Allison thanks again uh I there was a<br>position for the division for the uh the<br>associate Dean International I was not<br>going to apply for that position<br>honestly but Allison said you should do<br>it you should do it I appli for the<br>position and I got short listed and I<br>remember I had an interview with Peter<br>kampton that was a PVC of sciences and<br>with Helen Nicholson that was a DVC<br>probably for external engagement and in<br>that interview I remember I came in I<br>said look I was not going to play for<br>this possession I started that way and<br>the reason why I said is because I think<br>is I'm not sure if I have the ability to<br>do this here uh at the end I remember I<br>was with Mike Swain and with uh sonan ma<br>having a coffee imagine<br>that with in good oil at that time and<br>they told me they I got a call from<br>Peter kampton Peter kampton told me uh<br>Andrew uh do you want the position and I<br>said uh do you want you need to tell me<br>because I have to tell the other<br>candidates you would be if you don't<br>accept this so I accept it and again I<br>need to acknowledge and Helen and and<br>Peter for their support but more<br>important what I needed to do was an<br>implementation intern internalization<br>implementation plan for the division<br>that there was no plan in in<br>international ass aspects of the<br>framework and that divisional that<br>strategic plan that we created was a a<br>core for other divisions to do<br>internalization plan for each of the<br>divisions as well so for me that was the<br>first plan that I had to do and I think<br>it was really good for me last but not<br>least I would say is again Paul and Jeff<br>because both of them you have encouraged<br>me to do better and to at least extend<br>my services on other<br>areas last but not least achievements<br>for the students and I can see some of<br>you yeah you can see the photograph up<br>there yeah so I've see now the our fifth<br>years and fourth year students there's<br>some of the photographs here uh I can<br>see Thomas around and I think probably<br>he's here in the one of the photographs<br>when you were a second year<br>student I I I want to acknowledge and I<br>want to thank all the students postgrads<br>and undergrads and the reason why is<br>because the reason I'm here is to<br>achievement you are able to pass the<br>knowledge um you need you're able to<br>share um maybe as a student Support<br>Officer I've I've seen different aspects<br>from different students they're<br>struggling and sometimes you have to be<br>resilient resilient in a way that you<br>need to understand that people will have<br>problems and as an academic you need to<br>know that when you're doing the teaching<br>and you're doing that for the students<br>so I've had the ability to be involved<br>in each of the levels as they progress<br>from undergrads on to being a<br>professional either being a henus a<br>bachelor of oral health or BDS in in<br>dentistry and that that's for me is an<br>achievement in a way that I can see the<br>profession then I will leaving the<br>profession in good<br>hands and one of the things that you see<br>is as well is that you're part of that<br>achievement so I say always celebrate<br>the journey because it's a team effort<br>this is not only you it's not only the<br>lecturer that's given that knowledge but<br>it's how you can bring that student to a<br>level that is competent required but<br>it's also that they enjoy in a very<br>positive experience uh<br>environment if I go I'm you that's a<br>succession and I think that like after<br>Co we had a big cohort at like<br>2022 and you see that big cohort of 23<br>students coming through some of them<br>waiting for a year and a half to be able<br>to transfer because they want to migrate<br>they want to have that International<br>experience because of the quality of<br>what Oto can provide and then I need to<br>celebrate that because that's something<br>that I wouldn't be<br>here if imbu articulation program wasn't<br>here so I need to recognize that and I<br>want to thank them as<br>well last but not least bsrat students<br>so I have a couple of students and I can<br>say with war here that we've trained<br>more than 80% of the profession here in<br>New Zealand and dog as<br>well um I I can say that the<br>professionals that we get out from Oto<br>that graduate from Oto are of good<br>quality that will search around the<br>world and they're really Keen to get our<br>graduates in Australia that means that<br>our graduates when they graduate they<br>will have a job even before in the<br>second year and that recognizes the<br>quality of the work that we

can<br>enjoy<br>it uh I'm a very down toe guy I'd like<br>to be simple even if I have a title of a<br>professor I'm approachable and I prefer<br>to be approach as Andrew not as<br>Professor Andrew because that that's my<br>my my personality I'm down to earth I'm<br>approachable and I I'm relaxed and<br>that's what I like and whenever you want<br>to have a coffee I'm more than happy to<br>have one<br>thank you very much<br>OT that's it thank you very<br>much um thank you or Tina CTO curo<br>Carolines uh I have the great privilege<br>of being able to thank<br>Andrew uh for um your excellent<br>inaugural professorial<br>lecture we've known each other a long<br>time uh 25 years and who would have<br>thought uh all those years ago when we<br>were in adjacent offices uh midle yours<br>a bit smaller than mine uh that would we<br>would be celebrating uh your successes<br>on the stage together<br>today all I can say is thank you uh and<br>congratul<br>ulations Maria and<br>Camila thank you to you too for sharing<br>Andrew with us in the faculty we really<br>appreciate uh all that time that You'<br>have allowed him to give to<br>us your lecture was based on three<br>foundations uh where you're from the<br>foundations of teeth and laying the<br>foundations for the<br>future you told us of your upbringing in<br>Columbia Cali Rus and bitar and your<br>dancing uh how uh you transformed your<br>learning and your teaching from needing<br>to uh use additional teacher time in the<br>breaks to get<br>remediation uh through to someone who<br>came second uh in your dental<br>class all with the support of your<br>family and your drive I had a strong<br>tinge uh on the memory banks as well<br>when you talked about swimming and while<br>you didn't mention it the hours of<br>swimming the distances you swam but also<br>the benefits that you've gained uh from<br>this not the least<br>self-discipline uh and drive and now but<br>I imagine not at the time when you were<br>doing all the training you were doing uh<br>for your own health and well-being and<br>probably most importantly the<br>opportunity to have a starring role in<br>the dent review for the last two years<br>uh even though you got second both<br>times uh your presentation on your<br>career and achievements covered your<br>research uh and your achievements in<br>clinical overdentures and and that along<br>with the work that you've done as you've<br>mentioned uh with your collaborators has<br>made a really significant contribution<br>to dentistry in that<br>space uh and then more recently uh<br>implant complications implant surface<br>deterioration from your PhD and the work<br>that you've carried on from there and<br>then your digital Dentistry which is<br>really one of the areas where Dentistry<br>is heading<br>now you've shown us just how much you've<br>achieved uh and really what you can<br>achieve as a member of a<br>team and that we've seen that uh really<br>from the number of you that are here<br>today to support Andrew uh in his<br>inaugural professorial lecture I hope<br>that you can continue to enjoy the<br>Professor Andrew on behalf of the<br>University I'd like to thank you for<br>your inaugural professorial lecture and<br>congratulate you on all your<br>achievements and I'd like to offer you<br>this thanks I need to probably a moment<br>it uh this this thanks uh from the<br>University that celebrates and<br>acknowledges your achievements uh and<br>Professor<br>uh finally uh um I'd like to give an<br>apology on behalf of the Deputy Prov<br>Vice chancelor who's unable to be here<br>uh today to give this last part of the<br>uh uh celebrating this evening uh<br>because he was stuck in Christ Church<br>due to the winds in Den Eden that<br>prevented him from flying down here to<br>be here with us<br>today uh but he would have said uh thank<br>you to you all for coming tonight to<br>share this uh uh achievement with
