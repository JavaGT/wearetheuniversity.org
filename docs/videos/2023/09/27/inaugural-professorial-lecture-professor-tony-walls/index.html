Tony Wall's<br>inaugural professorial lecture I feel<br>that on this occasion given our<br>relatively informal Society it's<br>important to say the words Professor<br>Tony walls as often as possible in the<br>speech<br>attending an organ professorial lectures<br>is one of the enormous pleasures of this<br>job<br>I probably didn't say it in English I'm<br>Trish priest the editing acting<br>Pro Vice Chancellor Health Sciences for<br>the University of otago so I get to go<br>to a lot of ipls and it's always a<br>wonderful experience you get to know a<br>bit more about some of your colleagues<br>and always learn lots of interesting<br>things and hear an interesting story<br>about their Journey so I'm absolutely<br>delighted to be here in Christchurch for<br>this IPL and you can see I'm joined by<br>some of my senior colleagues which just<br>helps to acknowledge<br>how important this promotion is and how<br>much we think it's important to note<br>this moment<br>so it's my role to welcome you all to<br>this special event where we celebrate<br>the festival's achievements and the<br>people who supported him through his<br>academic Journey<br>um I want to especially welcome his wife<br>Sarah Tolbert son Fraser his mother<br>Heather walls and mother-in-law Suzanne<br>Talbot I think there's other friends and<br>family here whose names I don't know so<br>welcome to all of you and welcome to<br>people who are either watching online or<br>watching the recording later<br>becoming a professor is the Pinnacle of<br>the academic Journey it requires<br>creativity commitment perseverance to<br>achieve at the required level to be<br>promoted<br>and it's particularly impressive when<br>it's done by somebody who also has a<br>clinical job<br>um<br>so we really I'm really impressed<br>with all of those characteristics that<br>Tony has demonstrate demonstrated<br>alongside being a busy clinician I'm<br>really looking forward to his inaugural<br>professorial lecture and I will now pass<br>on to the dean Professor sus pitamer to<br>provide an introduction to Professor<br>isn't this so exciting it's actually I<br>think your professorial is like it's<br>this is Tony's last exam<br>and I think there isn't this a nice<br>occasion to come together with Tony for<br>his last exam I feel like the academic<br>institution is<br>uh has a long hazing process it's like<br>going to a boarding school you can't<br>escape but tonight Tony we promise is<br>your last hazing I did promise Tony that<br>I would not share any inappropriate or<br>dodgy stories so this is going to be a<br>very short introduction<br>um<br>uh Tony started here in March 2010 which<br>feels like time and Memorial ago now but<br>I've had the real privilege I have a<br>privilege of Dean as being Tony as the<br>head of Department of Pediatrics of<br>being his line manager so we get to talk<br>about fun things like HR and money and<br>finances so hold on to your hats for<br>that but actually the more fun stuff<br>that I've had the pleasure of working<br>alongside Tony<br>is actually as a colleague and he has<br>such a passion for social accountability<br>and he every year puts up his hands to<br>go with our team into the kurukopapa<br>Maori immersion schools and where we<br>offer free pediatric screening with our<br>50-year students and it's such a<br>privilege to see Tony I get I think this<br>amazing glimpse of not just one amazing<br>and clinicianas what amazing academic he<br>is but also what an amazing role model<br>here is around the importance of social<br>accountability and Health Equity<br>and so I was going to email all his<br>colleagues and ask them for dodgy<br>stories but given that this is a<br>grown-up event<br>um the the I thought of a whakatoki<br>which is a Maori proverbial saying which<br>was<br>coined by the late King ihaka<br>so many of you be familiar with the even<br>but of it it's on some good ads and<br>marketing campaigns but I really wanted<br>to focus on the front end of that<br>whakatoki which says if you pluck the<br>center of the flex suit so the center<br>bit of the haraki care where will the<br>Bell birds sing<br>and how we easily have to then search<br>and seek for where is safe and I think<br>that there's<br>um is very this analogy of the harakiki<br>bush is really key and explains to me a<br>lot about the characteristics of Tony<br>and that the center of the harike<br>represents our children and our upcoming<br>generation and then the withered leaves<br>around the outside represent us Tony uh<br>that we've and our job is to buffer um<br>to buffer the winds and the storms to<br>keep the inner shoots uh safe and I<br>think Tony's work and infectious<br>diseases especially and in his drive to<br>be not just amazing pediatrician but<br>amazing pediatric researcher really well<br>personifies that so it's with great<br>pleasure and an honor that I meet<br>Professor Tony walls to the stand kyota<br>Koto<br>'s<br>it's a pleasure to be here tonight with<br>you all thank you all for coming I<br>really appreciate it it's nice to have<br>the family here it's nice to have my<br>colleagues from work and<br>and if he was really special<br>I'm kind of not a let's make a fuss kind<br>of guy I think and so this will be<br>fairly informal<br>um it feels a bit odd to me to be having<br>all the fuss made but in the end I kind<br>of went with<br>it's actually quite nice and you've<br>worked hard and so I'm just gonna lean<br>into it and we'll<br>we'll I'm<br>I just thought I'd uh take it as it<br>comes so thank you all for being here I<br>um I wanted to start with<br>the slide about the the 50th anniversary<br>of<br>University of otago Christchurch because<br>I this is where kind of I grew up as a<br>med student I remember sitting<br>I think over up there on my fifth year<br>exams<br>Richard matsus who's one of the<br>pediatricians up north we all got the<br>same result I don't actually know how<br>that worked out I was behind her but<br>anyway you read into that what you want<br>um so I kind of there's no there's no<br>names carved on the desks or anything<br>like because we're all very civilized<br>but it was it was nice to it's nice to<br>be doing that here and I spent a few<br>years away before coming back<br>to Christchurch and it was it was great<br>to be able to do so<br>I need to reflect on<br>uh the the previous professors and<br>Pediatrics who have come before me most<br>of most of which I've either met<br>or known<br>uh I think I'm the fifth there was uh<br>Fred Shannon first David teal who was<br>infectious diseases specialist so he was<br>important to me because then I knew they<br>existed<br>and lastly there's been Brian Dalo and<br>Andrew day both of which have had a<br>really I guess reflecting on a big<br>effect on my career<br>Brian I guess recruited me to my first<br>job here which was great but I remember<br>further back when I was a student he was<br>he was the guy who was leading the<br>research in Pediatrics he was the the<br>main researcher in Pediatrics and really<br>someone that I looked up to so it's<br>great to I think Brian might be online<br>so if you are the O'Brien I really<br>appreciate your input on those early<br>years<br>and then Professor Andrew day who I<br>followed around the world really he<br>might have thought at times that I was<br>stalking him because uh he was when I<br>was a a newbie registrar first year<br>registrar Andrew was my senior Edge<br>and uh and then we both disappeared to<br>various places but I ended up following<br>a Pacific Children's Hospital and work<br>there for two of their years then he<br>came here and about a year or so<br>afterwards I followed Andrew here and<br>then I followed him at the job of head<br>of department so I don't know what he<br>thinks of all that but um I really<br>appreciate Andrew's leadership along the<br>way and and leading the way forward for<br>me so it's and it does feel a bit odd<br>standing up here in that same role with<br>those two gentlemen<br>um and it's a bit hard to think end of<br>the university gives you kind of a wide<br>open no remit really as to what to talk<br>about which I thought was quite Brave<br>which was good of them but<br>um I I thought what I'd do tonight is<br>perhaps just reflect on some of the<br>research work that I've done<br>and when you're when you're a fifth year<br>student I can absolutely guarantee that<br>I wasn't sitting there thinking I want<br>to make a difference I was thinking<br>what's happening Friday night and what's<br>happening with the footy on the weekend<br>or the cricket of any other season it<br>was I certainly wasn't thinking about<br>making a difference but as you as you go<br>through you reflect and I guess building<br>up diversity reflect on the bits that<br>have been important to you and a value<br>and it's always been something<br>when you look back things that have made<br>a difference in children's lives or<br>their family's lives have been in terms<br>of research content the stuff that I've<br>really enjoyed and the stuff that I<br>think is important so I'll touch on a<br>couple of things with that<br>and I also want to uh I'll touch on the<br>title of this talk which is research for<br>children arterial which is our new<br>research platform which I was kind of<br>looking forward and what were the<br>difference that we would like to make<br>going forward<br>so Asus said I'm an infectious diseases<br>specialist sometimes we know where<br>infections come from sometimes we don't<br>in children<br>and I think if you had to have one slide<br>something at my job it's probably this<br>one<br>um<br>I'm one of those annoying people who<br>think I've got the best job in the world<br>you know I I do all this University<br>stuff but I also have all this time<br>working with children<br>um recently one of my colleagues Dawn<br>Elder retired and she had a something in<br>the papers in the University<br>newsletter or whatever it was<br>and I think and I hope I'm not<br>misquoting dawn she said something on<br>the lines of one day she was on a ward<br>round with a professor of Pediatrics and<br>a small child kicked him in the stomach<br>and she thought this job's for me and I<br>could really relate to that to be fair<br>working working with the little ones is<br>just an enormous privilege they're<br>unpredictable they are energetic they're<br>brutally honest they are crazy they're<br>all that sort of stuff and that's the<br>fun man that's the stuff that is really<br>really good so<br>sometimes I'll say to mums and dads you<br>know what you all right what's your job<br>and I'll say well I'm going to fix this<br>diseases specialist but for children and<br>you get these weird looks oh yeah what's<br>that all about<br>why would anyone want to do that it's a<br>bit bizarre<br>and in reality I'm not kind of sure<br>there wasn't any sort of any big time<br>when I sort of decided that's what I was<br>going to do I suppose I suppose there<br>was what I can't really recall<br>but you go back through<br>sort of family records and stuff looking<br>for things and and maybe there was a<br>moment where perhaps<br>perhaps infectious diseases came into my<br>life so the mumps vaccine didn't arrive<br>in New Zealand to 1990 but here's me<br>clearly with the mumps<br>a little bit before that I won't tell<br>you how long before that it might you<br>know maybe this is the moment this is<br>the time an infectious diseases came to<br>to me and became<br>I guess if you were looking at this and<br>thinking future careers as a couple<br>you'd probably cut off fashion would<br>probably be off<br>the the lady responsible for the haircut<br>because<br>number five on the chain and to be fair<br>I'm pretty Wiggly I remember not really<br>enthused about haircuts so in those days<br>you just got what you get thank you very<br>much move on<br>um but it does make me reflect on how<br>lucky I've been<br>and growing up in a household with a<br>couple of school teachers<br>and loads of older brothers and sisters<br>and you know that environment probably<br>you know pediatricians know talk all the<br>time about the first<br>a thousand days<br>of a child's life and I you know I had a<br>pretty good or we didn't have top of the<br>range tricycles clearly but<br>but was everything else you need there<br>it was funny books there was all sorts<br>of stuff going on we all well provided<br>to it so I was pretty lucky<br>the other story is the bloke who's<br>taking this Photograph so my dad's no<br>longer with us he didn't seem to get to<br>med school<br>but you can guarantee he had a twinkle<br>in his eye when he was taking this photo<br>you can guarantee come on Tony let's get<br>you outside it's a lovely day we'll get<br>a photograph because he knew that this<br>is the sort of thing that's going to<br>turn up later in life yeah so<br>he knew and and again I<br>um<br>I can't talk about too much but it it's<br>just he was a wonderful role model for<br>me so really really lucky in all those<br>aspects<br>so I wanted to talk a little bit about<br>uh immunizations tonight I'm going to<br>start with whooping cough<br>and go through the history of that in<br>Canada because it is a little bit unique<br>and and talk specifically about<br>preventing hubikloth with vaccines and<br>that's all about vaccinating pregnant<br>women<br>now the next slide is perhaps disturbing<br>to people but that's the reality<br>whooping cough is a scary disease for<br>the little ones<br>I always kind of say to students that<br>this is the one that probably scares me<br>the most because this is the one that as<br>doctors we can't do anything about and<br>these little babies cough and cough and<br>cough until they go blue and it's and<br>it's you know it's an awful thing to see<br>I I toured with putting a video out<br>there but it's actually too distressing<br>to watch a video of a baby coughing like<br>this so it's something that we really<br>need to be working hard on to prevent in<br>this country<br>and some of you'll be may be aware that<br>just recently uh just this year there's<br>been a number of death from whooping<br>cough which we haven't seen for a number<br>of years in New Zealand all related to<br>uh um disease spreading in the community<br>without us knowing and in each case<br>the mum hadn't been vaccinated and these<br>were young babies who unfortunately<br>ended up in the ICU and died<br>and there's been more and more cases<br>coming through and that talking to some<br>colleagues from Auckland last week in<br>some of these cases these babies they<br>went and tested the whole Farm out and<br>found that pretty much everyone had<br>whooping cough that was close to this<br>baby so these are these are preventable<br>and he's the he's the kind of theory as<br>to why babies are most at risk so in<br>those in the middle years you see here<br>we vaccinate when we do it well we<br>vaccinate well and so infants are<br>particular against whooping cough<br>through their school years they're<br>protected will give them a booster when<br>they're 11 so in the that purple box<br>everything's good<br>but we don't vaccinate after that and so<br>naturally whooping cough immunity wanes<br>your protection against whooping cough<br>wanes so that by the time you are of an<br>age when you're having your own children<br>the chance of you having<br>effective protection against whooping<br>cough is pretty slim so when a baby<br>comes into the house<br>they are at risk<br>if the older family members get whooping<br>cough out in the community and there's a<br>lot of spread that we don't understand<br>in the community and adults are young<br>people because they're distant from<br>their immunizations and so<br>that's the that's the risk for babies<br>and of course<br>vaccinating mum during pregnancy gets<br>around that<br>by providing antibodies for baby before<br>they're born<br>and just to illustrate the difficulties<br>with us if this is data from the UK just<br>before they started vaccinating woman<br>against whooping cough<br>if you look at the uh along the bottom<br>there's the weeks of the year the total<br>number of cases along the left<br>and the uh you can see there that there<br>are three doses of<br>whooping cough vaccine given to<br>inference from about eight or nine weeks<br>of eight from eight weeks it takes a<br>couple of weeks to start working<br>and after one dose there's fewer cases<br>after two doses fewer cases of three<br>dose they're pretty much all gone but<br>you can see in the gray bars there the<br>unimmunized children the children that<br>are too young to get whooping cough<br>vaccine<br>and these are the cases who are coming<br>in the hospital and the the cruel<br>reality is that the younger you are the<br>worse your hooping cough is going to be<br>and so there's there's this big gap in<br>those first two or three months<br>where children are little babies are<br>potentially uh unprotected against<br>hooping cough and we've been under able<br>to protect them so this is 2011 2012 in<br>the UK we had a similar sort of thing<br>going on in New Zealand at the time and<br>we made the choice and Professor Murdoch<br>was involved in all that uh to go ahead<br>to start using whooping cough vaccine<br>during pregnancy for the first time in<br>New Zealand Canterbury was one of the<br>first places to do that in the country<br>and<br>um it was really because<br>and the context of all this is that no<br>one had been vaccinating pregnant women<br>prior to this in New Zealand it was a<br>New Concept it was a little bit scary<br>perhaps<br>and uh but there were there were babies<br>dying of whooping cough in the community<br>and we had to do something<br>and when we thought that this was going<br>to be an effective method for protecting<br>those infants in the first few months of<br>life<br>and sometimes we think back and people<br>think that that this was all new it was<br>all you know we're giving this vaccine<br>and pregnancy no one's ever done this<br>before but it's just not true because<br>around the world for more than a decade<br>people have been vaccinating pregnant<br>women<br>with almost an identical vaccine just<br>without the whooping cough component to<br>protect against maternal and neonatal<br>tetanus around the world so vaccinating<br>if we look to other parts of the world<br>we could see that vaccinating pregnant<br>the woman wasn't new and wasn't scary<br>but the reality is it still was so so uh<br>I was fortunate to be given a grant to<br>do some work around<br>um<br>vaccinating pregnant woman and we<br>did a<br>study so so we did a prospective study<br>of the infants and the baby and the<br>woman who were given Tdap the the<br>tetanus diphtheria a cellular pertussis<br>vaccine for the first time during<br>pregnancy followed them from the time<br>they received the vaccine with close<br>monitoring after the birth saw the baby<br>and followed the babies through to most<br>of them through to 12 months of life<br>and the great thing was there weren't<br>any adverse effects found from That<br>vaccine and at the time that was very<br>reassuring and uh to this date this this<br>Remains the biggest study of individual<br>follow-up of babies who have been<br>exposed to the vaccine during pregnancy<br>because most of the other work that's<br>been done subsequently has been<br>um has been large cohorts and<br>observations following that way<br>what's valuable for me in this and the<br>the bit that I look back on and think<br>was great is the fact that we integrated<br>this into clinical care so we remarkably<br>we've got a grant from the dhb which is<br>probably the most remarkable thing of<br>all that we won't see nowadays but it<br>was it was basically we this was<br>business as usual but we were doing<br>research along the way and I think<br>that's what we need to be doing a lot<br>more of trying to uh integrate the<br>research that we're doing uh whenever<br>we're doing new interventions like this<br>subsequently we found out that it really<br>works you know the data from the UK<br>where they introduced it really early on<br>showed that at least the 90 protection<br>stopping babies under three months of<br>age being admitted to hospital with<br>whooping cough this is a this is a great<br>vaccine to be using It's very effective<br>and everyone should be getting it who's<br>pregnant<br>unfortunately that's not the way it<br>works all right so you can have a great<br>vaccine but until it makes it into<br>someone's arm it's of no use<br>so we haven't done as well as we would<br>like Mrs data from Nikki Turner's group<br>uh published earlier this year and<br>showing the overall coverage of pregnant<br>women across the country you see the<br>dotted line is the average we've we've<br>never made it to 50 of women getting<br>whooping cough vaccine during pregnancy<br>Canterbury is actually done a little bit<br>better than than most other regions<br>around the country and it's probably<br>something to do with<br>um our excellent sort of primary care<br>networks that have taken this on board<br>but other places not so well and you can<br>see that<br>this is really in my view a bit of a<br>failure of of the Ministry of Health and<br>the government in terms of getting this<br>done so it's a bit disappointing they've<br>especially been failing to reach modern<br>Pacific communities which is which is<br>obviously not what we were like<br>and you know there's going to be lots of<br>reasons why this happened the actual<br>we've only gone up to 2021 here that you<br>can see uh but actually later on it's<br>it's possibly dropped off again post<br>covered<br>so we need to do better and it's all<br>very well to have a great vaccine one<br>that you think's safe one that thinks<br>works but if we're not achieving that<br>not getting it done<br>then that's not quite as good as it<br>should be<br>in 2017<br>as things were going upwards Health<br>targets were essentially removed and no<br>one was being held accountable to health<br>Targets on immunizations which I think<br>is a real shame and I guess if I had one<br>wish nowadays it would be that we<br>reintroduced some targets and double air<br>efforts to make sure that for this<br>vaccine in particular given what's going<br>on in our community that we're really<br>getting it out here the people who<br>really need it<br>so I don't want to download the entire<br>time you can't get away without a um a<br>covert mention and it infectious<br>diseases talk but you're safe I'm not<br>going to talk about it too much<br>the purpose of talking about covert is<br>really to remember back to how we all<br>learned the word epidemiologist if you<br>didn't know it already during covert<br>yeah they suddenly became the Kings<br>they were the ones who were making the<br>newspapers<br>and it was all about epidemiology<br>I kind of some of you have heard me talk<br>on Covert will understand that I don't<br>necessarily agree with lots of the stuff<br>that's published and stuff about<br>epidemiology and I won't go into that<br>but<br>um I I guess I consider myself an<br>amateur epidemiologist as many much of<br>the work that I've been doing is related<br>to epidemiology but I usually recruit<br>some experts whenever I'm doing it<br>um I'm going to talk about this bug I'm<br>going to talk this is a bacteria this is<br>streptococcus pneumoniae<br>really common bacteria that you isolate<br>in the the nasopharynx of of children<br>but it can causes disease in adults as<br>well<br>really common cause of ear infections<br>circuitous media<br>uh pneumonia common cause of pneumonia<br>in the past before we had vaccinations<br>and these These are kind of referred to<br>not as invasive disease for some reason<br>they could be severe they can be<br>troubling for children they can<br>obviously very very painful at times for<br>children but they're not not the worst<br>of the spectrum of disease we talk about<br>invasive pneumococcal disease which is<br>where but and in my you know experiences<br>the babies and children become sick with<br>either blood poisoning or meningitis or<br>other presentations with septic shock<br>and those sort of things so that's what<br>we talk about we talk about invasive<br>human cocoa disease and when we follow<br>this is a vaccine preventable disease<br>and when we follow the epidemiology of<br>all this we don't follow all the<br>children with ear infections or with<br>pneumonia and things because that's<br>really challenging and difficult to<br>record and there's some difficulties<br>with classification but what we follow<br>is this invasive pneumococcal disease<br>and it's kind of the tip of the iceberg<br>it's a bit that we see the severe stuff<br>in hospital but we know there's a whole<br>lot of other stuff going on in the<br>background as well<br>and we have a number of conjugate<br>vaccines that we use against invasive<br>pneumococcal disease or pneumococcal<br>disease but particularly against<br>invasive pneumococcal disease<br>the numbers here represent serotypes now<br>you don't need to know all about the<br>serotype so all you need to know is we<br>started with seven and then a couple of<br>other options were added on it all had<br>the same ones but they had some added<br>ones so the 10 valence vaccine has three<br>additional ones a 13 Valiant vaccine has<br>three additional ones<br>and those are all the serial groups<br>there are more than a hundred Sarah<br>Sarah types I should say there's more<br>than 100 and we just cover the ones that<br>are kind of most common in the community<br>we started with the seven valence one<br>but that was unavailable in 2011 then we<br>were left with uh sort of two separate<br>choices<br>and that's what came down to farmac made<br>the choices about moving to which<br>vaccine next<br>and which was going to be the most<br>appropriate for the community at the<br>time when we first brought these in uh<br>we all thought they're all about the<br>same pick one doesn't matter which one<br>they'll do the job<br>it's all good uh and that's what they<br>did but we were also realized that there<br>was one serotype one called 19a which<br>I'm going to talk about today which<br>could potentially be a problem for the<br>community and we we kind of I think my<br>recollection is we made a note to say we<br>need to watch the epidemiology of the<br>stereotyping case it becomes a problem<br>and<br>in other countries in the world it did<br>become a problem all right so here's<br>some data just showing the three<br>serotypes that are in the 13 vaccine not<br>the 10.<br>and two countries in South America who<br>had used the 10 valid vaccine and<br>suddenly there was what we call serotite<br>replacement where the vaccine's not<br>covering this 19a<br>comes a Promenade predominant serotonic<br>causing invasive pneumococcal disease in<br>those communities and you can see a<br>pretty clear relationship in both Brazil<br>in 2013 and Colombia which took a couple<br>of years but the numbers of cases of<br>this 19a serotype uh going up and up and<br>up<br>and of course<br>that's what happened in New Zealand so<br>this graph I'll just take a little bit<br>of time on there are the years along the<br>bottom the rate of 19a disease listed on<br>the left<br>and<br>this is by age group the different<br>colors and graphs and the different<br>periods with vaccination uh the<br>background color so we started with a<br>PCV 10 vaccine<br>2014 to seven there was a change pharmac<br>must have got a good deal and they<br>changed to the PCB 13 and then while we<br>were one of the few countries in the<br>world who did the swap back and again<br>it's probably all came down to Dollars<br>and cents and we got a good deal from<br>the drug company I'm sure this is not<br>something I know anything about because<br>we're never told but I suspect that's<br>what happened and you can see if you<br>look particularly in the children under<br>two the Red Bar<br>shortly after 2017 the rates started<br>going up and up and up 2001 they got<br>quite High we started to get alarmed<br>2022 they got really high the rates of<br>this kind of outbreak strain of invasive<br>pneumococcal disease<br>and I haven't got the the graph for here<br>for you for 2023 because it's not<br>completed yet but I can tell you it's<br>going up and up and up and most of the<br>disease that's happening uh across the<br>country in little ones is due to this<br>19a serotype that was not in the vaccine<br>that we were using<br>I've seen Yankees in in the audience she<br>did some work this year comparing what's<br>happened in New Zealand the experience<br>with invasive pneumococcal disease to<br>what's happened in Australia now in<br>Australia they use the 13 valet vaccine<br>a good one all the way through<br>and if you look at firstly invasive<br>pneumococcal disease for the under twos<br>you can see that up until 2020 we're<br>about the same as Australia but all of a<br>sudden we had higher rates of all<br>invasive pneumococcal disease in<br>children under two the rates bumped up<br>and if you look at the 19a<br>disease specifically you can see the<br>proportion of out of infections that<br>were causing in severe disease in<br>children under two in New Zealand was<br>suddenly due to this 19a strain that's<br>so we all know by the time it makes its<br>way to stuff that we're really in<br>trouble<br>and this is what clinicians were noting<br>around the country that there was more<br>invasive humancoccal disease more cases<br>of sepsis more cases of meningitis and<br>when this when the information comes<br>back from a lab you'd find that it was<br>often this 1980 strain<br>so it was pretty uh I guess rewarding we<br>were pretty chuffed when late last year<br>farmac decided out of state from the<br>cycle that they would normally do and<br>this probably cost them a fair bit of<br>money to be fair to change<br>under pressure from all sorts of places<br>but I hope that the work that we've done<br>has kind of had some impact on that they<br>were able to change to the PCB 13<br>vaccine<br>now just like with whooping cough it's<br>absolutely no use if you change it if<br>people aren't getting it and we have all<br>sorts of trouble with our immunization<br>coverage across the board at the moment<br>which I won't bore you with tonight<br>but in terms of epidemiology having an<br>impact and making real changes that<br>hopefully makes a big difference for our<br>little ones this is something that<br>Albert can be really proud of<br>so now I'm going to turn and talk about<br>my favorite Topic at the moment which is<br>research for children aotearoa<br>this is a research collaborative that we<br>set up around about this time last year<br>right in this room<br>and it is unique in many ways it's not<br>just the University of otago it's across<br>various institutions<br>when we set it up we were you know I<br>couldn't include myself thinking more on<br>health lines but I need to acknowledge<br>my co-director professor Gail Gillen<br>who's the director over at the<br>child wellbeing Institute at the<br>University of Canterbury and she came to<br>me and we we sat down and thought we we<br>need a broader approach we need our<br>approach to research that not just<br>focused on health<br>but focused on families focused on the<br>environment the children are growing up<br>on and focus on their well-being and<br>being a multi-disciplinary and just<br>getting out of our little silos and<br>health and trying to extend that so<br>that's what we've tried to do<br>just to give you an example of some of<br>the collaborations that we've been<br>developing uh you many of you will be<br>aware that the the youth Health Center<br>in Christchurch will be setting up shop<br>next year sometime hopefully Midway<br>through next year and we've been having<br>some preliminary discussions about<br>integrating uh research capacity with<br>that Community talking to them about<br>what they would like in terms of<br>research development and seeing if when<br>they get off the ground all the<br>work that they're doing is side by side<br>with some clinical research as well from<br>from our team<br>I also met recently with the team from<br>the South Island Health Alliance who are<br>really Keen with all the changes with<br>tefata water and the structural changes<br>to ensure that when things are developed<br>that actually there's a research<br>component going alongside all the<br>clinical components as they go on<br>so that's that's an angle we're really<br>really pleased about<br>we're well supported by te Papa holder<br>now<br>I'm sure many of you are aware but<br>that's that's the health Precinct<br>um and I see Peter and pip up the back<br>there and I acknowledge their support<br>and help with setting up their<br>um uh research for children aotearoa<br>I really like the metaphor that they use<br>for of uh weaving everyone together in a<br>group is one that we really we really<br>like and so that that relationship with<br>us Within<br>is fantastic they they uh there's a lot<br>of different groups involved into Papa<br>holder and and so we want our research<br>teams to be working across institutions<br>having ideas flowing with different<br>teams in different disciplines and<br>that's what we're working towards<br>just as a recent example<br>um<br>this is my PhD student Talia working at<br>uh<br>etu Pacifica which is the<br>Pacific primary care practice just<br>across the road in the health precept<br>uh this was on Maori television last<br>week<br>and this is a really good example of<br>embedding<br>students in research in the community so<br>Talia is doing some work on acute<br>rheumatic fever and the experiences of<br>children and young people with acute<br>rheumatic fever and those of you who are<br>at the Abbott Symposium recent she's a<br>she did an excellent talk outlining how<br>this was important to her family and<br>she's been working as a healthcare<br>assistant at A2 Pacifica while she's<br>doing her research<br>and that's a deliberate plan to kind of<br>embed the research in her community and<br>make sure that she's well supported to<br>be working there so we hope I have that<br>successful for her I need to acknowledge<br>Kiki moyati who's our associate Dean<br>Pacific who kind of<br>gets that stuff underway as a senior<br>leader in the in the Pacific Medical<br>Association he kind of funds that job<br>and he actually insisted that Talia be<br>working and the people we've got through<br>be working in the community in NATO<br>Pacifica so that when they're doing that<br>research it's really relevant to them<br>I think he was in the Cook Islands when<br>he did this on Maori television it looks<br>very beachy anyway so we really<br>appreciate uh Kiki's support all the way<br>through<br>the other thing with research for<br>children how to though is is we want to<br>be the fun guys you know we want<br>research to be a lot of fun so later in<br>the year we've got planned the inaugural<br>research for children at Altera golf day<br>which Viv is helping to organize is<br>absolutely fantastic at the beautiful<br>titafa Golf Club<br>um uh no ability required I would<br>encourage this is kind of an invitation<br>to anyone who wants to come along and<br>wants to meet the team please come along<br>and uh hit a few golf balls we might<br>have to put some restrictions on those<br>who actually know how to hit a golf ball<br>so that it's a it's a fun event and and<br>and I think we may be<br>the only research group<br>that has its own golf ball<br>I suspect most of them will end up in<br>the river but um maybe I've got that all<br>wrong<br>so I I I won't cake you too long I just<br>there's one more acknowledgment I wanted<br>to make and that's uh my lovely wife<br>Sarah who's sitting here today<br>um<br>so this is all a journey isn't it and uh<br>both a a literal and figurative Journey<br>that you go on This Is Us oh God 20<br>years ago uh when I was training in<br>London and I think this is Christmas uh<br>in Florence where we ducked away to<br>we're hoping to do all again sometime<br>soon but um you know this stuff doesn't<br>happen if you don't have wonderful<br>support at home and I've thanked Sarah<br>before but I'm going to thank you public<br>as well for for all those times that<br>I've been you know on call working hard<br>way overseas all that drama<br>um I I could have done any of this<br>without Sarah so thank<br>I'm just going to finish with an<br>invitation and a challenge so the<br>invitation is if there's anyone out<br>there who's watching this online or or<br>who is here tonight who has a an<br>interest in child health or well-being<br>research please come and talk to us we<br>want to be expanding Making Connections<br>linking everyone together<br>the challenge I put out there is that we<br>need to work hard to make this a real<br>entity something with meaning something<br>that gets stuff done<br>we need to be working hard to be<br>reaching out to other researchers we<br>need to break down so silos we need to<br>be changing the way we work<br>I guess it's kind of going back to that<br>preschooler mentality where you're all<br>full-on and there's no restrictions and<br>you it's all excitement that's what kind<br>of what we're looking for<br>and I'd like to think that over the<br>coming years we can build this into<br>something that really does some great<br>work and hopefully has an impact on the<br>lives<br>of children and their families<br>I really appreciate you guys sharing<br>with me tonight uh thank you all for<br>coming<br>um<br>my name is Tony Valentine and I'm the<br>deputy Vice Chancellor external<br>engagement for the University and I've<br>come up to them from Dunedin for this<br>event it's great to be here in uttahi<br>Christchurch<br>and fantastic to be here this evening to<br>hear Professor wall share his<br>Reflections on his research and his<br>professional Journey these are very<br>special occasions and I think we've<br>heard a fantastic lecture this evening a<br>lecture that's not only reflected on on<br>the trajectory of Tony's career but I<br>think on something that's very important<br>which is the power of collaboration and<br>building connections and I think that<br>runs through<br>the the kind of retrospective<br>Reflections he shared with us but also<br>the The forward-looking Challenge and<br>vision that he shared with us at the end<br>these occasions are very special because<br>it is a chance for us to come together<br>as a community<br>to celebrate the outstanding<br>achievements of one of our colleagues to<br>celebrate their promotion to the highest<br>rank that we have in the university and<br>recognition of their excellence in<br>teaching and research and clinical work<br>and and service so<br>um and of course we've had a great<br>lecture this evening reflecting on on<br>Tony's work<br>more broadly these are really important<br>occasions because they celebrate those<br>key aspects of what to find the<br>university gain that teaching and<br>research but that commitment to making a<br>difference in the world and I think<br>Tony's work really embodies that spirit<br>so thank you for coming this evening<br>thank you Tony for a great talk and it's<br>been very special having a good group of<br>your family and friends here uh in the<br>room uh this evening so could I ask you<br>to join me in a final round of applause<br>for Tony please</p></main><footer
