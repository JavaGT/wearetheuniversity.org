evening everyone<br>um I'm going to start with karakia<br>um and a few Mahi uh before I do a more<br>formal uh introduction<br>Modi order<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>good evening everyone it's lovely to see<br>you all here my name is Angela onehala<br>and as the head of otago's History<br>program I'd like to thank you all for<br>being here in person and online this<br>evening for our annual Michael King<br>memorial lecture<br>the history program established this<br>annual lecture in honor of Michael in<br>2004 the year of his premature death in<br>a car accident now Michael was a popular<br>and very influential historian of New<br>Zealand whose Legacy included over 30<br>books which range from General histories<br>to biography Memoir and many other<br>pieces of writing<br>he was greatly admired for his ability<br>to convey the complexities of this<br>country's history to a wide and varied<br>audience and also for his knowledge of<br>Maori culture and history<br>the Michael K Memorial lecture was<br>conceived as a way of giving an<br>afterlife to the spirit of his work<br>and we are delighted that Nikki Harga<br>has agreed to be the 18th in a very<br>distinguished line of speakers since<br>2004 and we're sure that her subject<br>would have been of special interest to<br>Michael<br>um and it's now with pleasure that I get<br>to walk away from the microphone and<br>hand it over to my colleague associate<br>professor John Stenhouse who's going to<br>introduce Nikki tonight so thank you<br>John<br>Kira Koto thanks everyone for coming<br>I met Nikki Hager first in the early<br>1970s<br>we were classmates at Palmer's North<br>boys high school<br>initially all I knew was that Nikki came<br>from Levin and that his father made high<br>quality shirts<br>later I learned that the Nazis had<br>driven the family out of Austria<br>neither of us felt entirely comfortable<br>with our school's traditional masculine<br>ethos<br>Nikki struck me as gentle<br>independent-minded and at times a bit of<br>a stirrer<br>the high school he studied physics and<br>philosophy at Victoria while I studied<br>history at Massey with Bill Oliver<br>over the years he popped up in the<br>papers and on TV<br>as he built a remarkable career as an<br>investigative journalist and author<br>his books include secret power 1996<br>secrets and lies 1999<br>seeds of distrust 2002 The Hollow Men<br>2006 other people's Wars 2011.<br>and hit and run 2017 on the New Zealand<br>SAS in Afghanistan<br>A friend gave me Nikki's 2014 book dirty<br>politics<br>how are Tech politics is poisoning New<br>Zealand's political environment<br>although at first I wasn't quite sure<br>about the title<br>I started reading and couldn't stop<br>as an historian trained to read sources<br>critically<br>I thought that Nikki supported his<br>arguments with plenty of evidence fairly<br>the book rang true<br>discussing it afterward with my<br>colleague Professor Liam mcelvaney we<br>agreed that what shocked us most about<br>dirty politics<br>was that more new zealanders weren't<br>shocked by it<br>Professor sir David skegg Vice<br>Chancellor at the of the University of<br>otago from 2004 to 2011.<br>cited dirty politics approvingly<br>in his Splendid 2019 book the health of<br>the people<br>many of the same bloggers<br>journalists For Hire politicians and<br>multinational corporations<br>whose dirty politics Nikki had exposed<br>skeg showed<br>worked to dismantle the public health<br>task force that he had been appointed to<br>lead during the 1990s<br>costing the country in the long run<br>billions of dollars and thousands of<br>lives<br>I've enjoyed reconnecting with Nikki on<br>recent research trips to Wellington<br>I admire his courage<br>honesty decency and commitment to<br>telling the truth<br>Come What May<br>it's my privilege to invite him<br>to deliver the 2023 Michael King<br>memorial lecture<br>the battle for and against New Zealand's<br>nuclear free policy<br>a secret history<br>can you hear me clearly<br>together<br>thank you for coming<br>I'm obviously in very good company<br>I'm also honored to be speaking on the<br>Michael King memorial lecture<br>and I thank the organizers for trusting<br>me<br>and I also thank the organizers for<br>organizing it when the universities in a<br>um<br>because it's sort of a because it's a<br>very formal and important thing to give<br>a memorial lecture<br>I've written a lecture<br>which those of you who speak publicly<br>will know is not the best way to give a<br>speech<br>but I decided that what I will we will<br>lose in presentation you will hopefully<br>gain in decision and referencing and<br>things<br>so<br>so it has to be<br>um<br>Michael King was an important part of<br>the intellectual environment did I and<br>many of you grew up in<br>his prolific work<br>as a writer suggested lives that we<br>could possibly lead<br>his penguin history of New Zealand was<br>the first general history of New Zealand<br>I read personally expanding my<br>understanding of the country I live in<br>sparking my interest in reading more<br>history a subject which had been almost<br>absent from my education<br>my science-based secondary school and<br>University education<br>I remember how when I read the penguin<br>history of New Zealand<br>there was one subject I wished he'd<br>covered more fully<br>it being a subject which I knew about<br>myself<br>it seems fitting to use this Memorial<br>extra to describe in more detail this<br>one of the numerous subjects that<br>Michael could only address briefly when<br>he was covering the whole human history<br>of New Zealand in one book<br>the subject I've chosen as you know<br>already is the momentous but not fully<br>understand event understood events of<br>1985.<br>when the great win against Great<br>resistance<br>New Zealand banned nuclear powered and<br>nuclear-armed warships from New Zealand<br>a national scale protest against nuclear<br>weapons<br>the setting for the story is the late<br>Cold War<br>the conflict was feeling closer to home<br>for us in the South Pacific with nuclear<br>testing nuclear weapon testing happening<br>on the on our doorstep and great<br>pressure for New Zealand to align<br>ourselves with the British and American<br>foreign policies<br>the South Pacific was also being used as<br>a base for secret nuclear command and<br>control facilities<br>it was a huge thing for our three<br>million strong ex-british colony<br>Good Old Country to refuse to fall into<br>line with the anglo-american allies and<br>distance itself in a nuclear arms race<br>like other major public interest social<br>and political change in New Zealand the<br>new query policy was strongly resisted<br>vigorously fought for and eventually<br>became part of the national identity of<br>the country<br>the nuclear free policy was a product of<br>a huge outpouring of public concern and<br>energy<br>when the last nuclear-armed empowered<br>U.S warship visited Wellington on August<br>1983 by exactly 40 years ago practically<br>the USS Texas was met by a floater of<br>protest boats at the harbor mouth<br>by use Trade union strikes on the wolves<br>protest services in the Central City<br>churches<br>school student protests women for peace<br>protests a 10 000 People March through<br>the Central City accompanied by a parade<br>of grotesque sculptures<br>built by the city's artists all the<br>culmination of years of organizing the<br>base and protest<br>the nuclear free and independent Pacific<br>movement connected the New Zealand<br>protests into the Pacific wide struggle<br>David Lange the leader of the opposition<br>called the Texas visit a calculated<br>unfriend friendly act by the American<br>government and Cahoots with the national<br>government<br>less than a year after the Texas visit<br>David longy's labor government was<br>elected to power<br>and to the disbelief and anger of the<br>U.S and Australian government's the<br>nuclear free policy was adopted by<br>cabinet<br>a few years after that public opinion<br>was so strong that the National Party<br>adopted the nuclear free policy as well<br>it was made of generations of public<br>feelings about nuclear weapons and<br>anti-war feelings dating from the<br>horrors of the first world war and later<br>the Vietnam War<br>no government has dared to change it<br>since<br>but it could have all been different<br>there was a major counter campaign that<br>tried to stop the nuclear free policy<br>ever being born<br>that's the subject of this lecture which<br>you can read behind me the battle for<br>and against New Zealand's nuclear free<br>policy a secret history<br>with a secret History part refers to<br>hopefully interesting new information<br>that I can add to the story for the<br>the lessons of this piece of History are<br>very relevant today and what they show<br>about the way officials work to<br>influence government foreign foreign and<br>defense policy lessons that may help us<br>to understand and spot when the same<br>a year before David long he was elected<br>sorry yes a year before that David<br>longer was elected in New Zealand a new<br>labor government was elected in<br>Australia as well headed by the Prime<br>Minister Bob Hawke<br>a New York Times article explained what<br>happened there<br>the Australian labor government labor<br>party had said when out of office<br>campaigned on an anti-nuclear platform<br>after taking office in 1983 Mr Hawk<br>agreed to continue military ties with<br>the United States including visits by<br>nuclear powered and nuclear armed<br>warships<br>it was assumed by opponents of the New<br>Zealand nuclear the New Zealand policy<br>inside and outside the country that our<br>new government our new labor government<br>will do the same as the Australian<br>government<br>and drop the promise ban on visits by<br>nuclear powered and nuclear arm ships<br>the example of supposedly nuclear free<br>Japan also pointed this way<br>the same New York Times article noted<br>that Japan which has long had a policy<br>of banning nuclear weapons from its<br>territory has not forced the United<br>States to affirm each time a visit ship<br>visits that it does not carry weapons<br>the nuclear weapons<br>what this mean in practice was that that<br>Japan routinely had U.S aircraft<br>carriers and other vessels<br>which that were very likely to be<br>equipped with nuclear weapons the<br>Japanese policy was and still is simply<br>Hashem<br>the idea amongst opponents to new of New<br>Zealand's nuclear free policy was it<br>should be the same as Japan where the<br>U.S Navy with neither can the firm nor<br>deny the presence of nuclear weapons on<br>the ships visiting warship<br>and the New Zealand government would<br>adopt an official stance of glibly<br>trusting that the fist that the vessels<br>would would conform with our nuclear<br>free policy<br>in the same vein the head of longhi's<br>prime minister's Department who hated<br>the policy Gerald Hensley pointed to an<br>example of the example of Spain and<br>Denmark which he said quote just this is<br>a ridiculous quote but listen to it had<br>decided that the interests of their<br>Alliance made it worthwhile to accept an<br>occasional few days of uncertainty about<br>the temporary presence of nuclear<br>weapons in their harbors<br>in short<br>there was a quietly comfortable<br>assumption among opponents that amongst<br>the opponents the David longies labor<br>government would drop the policy or<br>agree to a meaningless trust-based<br>nuclear-free policy as these other<br>countries had done<br>plans were being made during the second<br>half of 20 1984 for a visit to New<br>Zealand by a U.S Destroyer which would<br>serve as a test case for the sellout of<br>most of the people here will know what<br>happened next<br>there was a massive public outraw uproar<br>the U.S warship visit was refused and<br>the nuclear free policy came into<br>existence<br>but we know much less about the forces<br>that came close to defeating the nuclear<br>free policy before it even came into<br>being<br>I will describe this counter campaign<br>shortly but first I should explain<br>something about this new information<br>about the new information that I can<br>bring to this lecture<br>a few weeks ago by chance<br>a friend of mine was researching in the<br>Turnbull library in Wellington and came<br>across an old newspaper clipping that he<br>thought I would be interested to see<br>the article looked back from a year<br>after the U.S Destroyer was barred from<br>a visit in New Zealand and explained the<br>events that stopped New Zealand backing<br>down on its nuclear free policy the<br>article reads<br>after months of negotiations with the<br>American government the ministries of<br>Foreign Affairs and defense last January<br>January were apparently sure that the<br>visit by a U.S warship would mean the<br>government's anti-nuclear would meet<br>sorry we're apparently sure that a visit<br>by U.S warship would meet the<br>government's anti-nuclear policy and<br>hold the alliance intact<br>then some members of the government<br>caucus and the Coalition against nuclear<br>warships stepped in as I'm still quote<br>in the newspaper the visit was canceled<br>but what is the Coalition against<br>nuclear warships and how good is this<br>information it's how good is its<br>information the newspaper asked today<br>the post profiles the Coalition against<br>nuclear warships<br>profiles the Coalition against nuclear<br>today<br>that's funny today the post profiles<br>Coalition against nuclear warships the<br>organization headed by a 26 year old<br>who apparently had more influence a more<br>profound influence of rather fence and<br>foreign policy than the state's own<br>institutions you'll see why I was kept<br>falling over that the 26 year old<br>looking more like 16 years old than 26<br>an Amelia life before my current career<br>I was there during those events covered<br>during the events covered by this<br>lecture which means I can contribute<br>some first-hand information about this<br>piece of History including things that<br>have stayed secret until now<br>I've been thinking for a long time about<br>recording this history but I waited<br>until it felt right to tell things where<br>I'd been sworn to secrecy<br>now with the passage of time nearly<br>everyone I'm going to mention is dead in<br>any way I think they would only be proud<br>I want to reassure I have to reassure I<br>need to reassure but I'm not claiming<br>some special determining role for myself<br>in the story of New Zealand becoming<br>nuclear free<br>I had great respect for David longy<br>um and I believe that various people<br>including him Helen Clark and the labor<br>party president Margaret Wilson played<br>the really crucial roles<br>and like all people power campaigns<br>numerous other people played important<br>roles each building on the efforts of<br>the people before them<br>but I was spokesperson and strategist<br>for the nuclear free campaign in the<br>capital city which means I was<br>particularly aware of The Who and the<br>how of the effort to sabotage the policy<br>I can add this I can add these new<br>the labor government was elected in the<br>19th as many will remember was elected<br>in the July 1984 snap election<br>its campaign emphasized nuclear-free<br>policy with election Billboards<br>promising that New Zealand would stay<br>nuclear free<br>four days after the election long he was<br>long he was asked of the nuclear free<br>policy was in any way negotiable he said<br>no it was a policy and the declared<br>position of the government full stop<br>meanwhile Foreign Affairs officials<br>advised the new labor government<br>ministers to agree with the Americans on<br>a six-month cooling down period<br>while the details of the nuclear free<br>policy were worked out<br>various commentators later claimed that<br>longi was not committed to the policy<br>and was open to watering it down<br>in this view long intended to use the<br>six months cooling down period to<br>wriggle out the policy but then was<br>forced into it by his party and had to<br>stick to it<br>I don't believe that for a second<br>however it would become clear that the<br>United States officials fully expected<br>long air to water down the policy and so<br>from the beginning there was a collision<br>coming when the election promised to<br>make the New Zealand nuclear free by<br>Banning nuclear armed empowered warships<br>had to be reconciled with the American<br>expectation that there was going to be<br>another Australia and Japanese style<br>accommodation meaning a backdown by New<br>Zealand<br>the sixth month cooling down period was<br>due to end in January 1985. that was<br>when the labor government had to decide<br>whether to accept the U.S Navy request<br>for one of its warships to visit New<br>Zealand<br>all the negotiate all the negotiations<br>were occurring in secret<br>but my colleagues and I began to have to<br>feel to feel suspicious that a backdown<br>was being prepared<br>the government had continued to insist<br>that they would not allow nuclear ships<br>into New Zealand<br>but it started talking about officials<br>arranging a special process for making<br>decisions on whether to approve U.S<br>shipment requests<br>the protest the process did not require<br>the U.S Navy to confirm or deny the<br>presence of nuclear weapons on a<br>visiting ship something it refused to do<br>and instead was based on the idea that<br>the New Zealand military staff could<br>reliably advise the government on<br>whether particular U.S warships obeyed<br>the nuclear free policy<br>for people paying close attention the<br>clue to what was being planned could be<br>seen along these statements that said<br>for instance here in that late 1980 1984<br>the government assisted by the defense<br>department and its researchers would<br>make an assessment on whether ships were<br>likely to be carrying nuclear arms<br>this could sound reasonable but the<br>giveaway word was likely<br>ships that were likely to be carrying<br>nuclear arms likely are not likely we're<br>not good enough because they both<br>implied possibly nuclear armed likely<br>suggested a strategy for defeating the<br>nuclear free policy first a ship could<br>be allowed to visit that was not very<br>likely to be nuclear armed but still<br>possibly could be and then once on a<br>slippery slope a succession of Warships<br>and submarines could come each<br>progressively more likely to be nuclear<br>armed<br>before long we would be no different<br>from different nuclear-free Japan with<br>U.S vessels coming and going as they're<br>pleased<br>this is what we start to suspect and as<br>we'll see shortly<br>is precisely what the officials were<br>planning based on these suspicions we<br>began the Urgent action to try to make<br>sure make it to make it more difficult<br>politically for the officials to get<br>away with this trick<br>on the 2nd of December 1984 about eight<br>weeks before the U.S ship decision date<br>I published an 11 page document<br>containing a list of all nuclear armed<br>and powered ships and submarines in the<br>U.S Navy<br>the introduction said<br>the list includes all those nuclear you<br>know all those United States warships<br>and submarines specifically prohibited<br>from visiting New Zealand by the labor<br>government's anti-nuclear policy<br>in practice the list identified vessels<br>that were equipped with systems for<br>launching and targeting nuclear weapons<br>since we would not know which ones were<br>actually carrying the weapons on board<br>at any given moment<br>by getting in first with the list and<br>spreading it around the journalists and<br>political people interested in the<br>nuclear free issue the idea was that any<br>warship announced to be visiting New<br>Zealand will be immediately compared to<br>the published list<br>I backed up the list with public<br>statements saying that if any vessel on<br>this list was invited to New Zealand it<br>will be met with massive protests<br>in the following weeks we introduced a<br>further concept which was that all<br>nuclear it was at the nuclear free<br>policy had to ban all nuclear-capable<br>vessels<br>a game we were trying to take away the<br>wriggle room since no one could know for<br>sure which vessels actually had nuclear<br>weapons on board a genuine policy had to<br>ban all vessels which were capable of<br>launching nuclear weapons<br>there was a showdown coming<br>if the government allowed a visit by<br>warship with systems capable of<br>launching nuclear weapons in other words<br>possibly nuclear-armed the nuclear free<br>policy was over<br>if they refused to visit<br>the nuclear free policy was set in stone<br>thus the scene was set<br>in the decades since these events many<br>want secret documents have been released<br>they showed that our suspicions about<br>the counter campaign were exactly right<br>New Zealand officials from defense<br>Foreign Affairs and the prime minister's<br>Department<br>told long in other ministers that will<br>be possible to have a strict band on<br>nuclear armed empowered warships and to<br>stay in the military ends this Alliance<br>the officials told them that they could<br>negotiate a diplomatic solution with the<br>Americans that honored Labor's nuclear<br>policy<br>but they then set out to undermine the<br>nuclear-free policy that's the officials<br>I mean New Zealand officials traveled up<br>back and forth United States in the<br>later later months of<br>1984 working on this plan<br>the documents show them working on the<br>plan when Military Officers would assess<br>whether visiting ships were nuclear free<br>but they also show us what the<br>government was not being told<br>in private it was an understanding at<br>the heart of the negotiations between<br>our officials in the United States<br>and what would hardened negotiations<br>that New Zealand would offer the<br>Americans what Secretary of Foreign<br>Affairs moved nourish called a<br>step-by-step progress towards an<br>accommodation<br>starting with ships less it's likely to<br>be nuclear armed during the visit and<br>moving towards what they called normal<br>pause access including a never debris<br>nuclear armed warships the New Zealand<br>position quote May well have to<br>incorporate an element of trust nourish<br>told his colleagues<br>the U.S deputy secretary of state sent<br>her telegram to New Zealand officials in<br>November this November 1984 saying that<br>while the first warship might be<br>unlikely to be nuclear armed the U.S<br>could accept this as a first step to<br>restoring full access but not as the<br>final position<br>the US the New Zealand chief of Defense<br>staff<br>ing the military officer who would be<br>given the job of assessing the nuclear<br>status of visiting ships spoke of quote<br>a ladder of increasingly sensitive<br>visits<br>and the U.S Secretary of State George<br>Schultz said it explicitly over time he<br>said quote over time you would have to<br>assume that our vessels would carry<br>nuclear arms<br>there was a slippery slope that we had<br>suspected<br>when David longaid said publicly that<br>the nuclear ship then was non-negotiable<br>I believe he really meant it<br>when he said publicly that New Zealand<br>officials could make judgments about<br>which ships were non-nuclear he was<br>believing that the officials could<br>deliver the solution and deliver a<br>solution that didn't compromise the<br>nuclear free policy<br>but he was being misled<br>I now head into the parts of the story<br>which have stayed secret until now<br>the crunch came in late January 1985. at<br>the end of a six-month call at the end<br>of the six month cooling down period<br>the U.S request for a visit by a U.S<br>Navy ship had been received in secret by<br>the government and the government's<br>decision was scheduled to be made at the<br>Monday cabinet meeting on the 28th of<br>January 1985.<br>longi was away on a trip to tokalau and<br>would arrive would arrive back Midway<br>through the cabinet meeting in time for<br>the ship visit decision<br>over the preceding weekend nuclear free<br>groups and labor party members had<br>mobilized people around the country in<br>fact I guarantee probably including<br>people in this room<br>to write to send 7 000 telegrams and<br>letters to Lobby<br>urging him to not back down on the<br>policy<br>overflowing mailbags greeted them and<br>the beehive on the Monday<br>but there are of course many but there<br>are of course many times when the public<br>campaign is hard just like this and it<br>doesn't win<br>those involved in the counter campaign<br>had also been preparing for months<br>they have on their side particularly the<br>threat that New Zealand's anglo-american<br>allies will be furious and punish New<br>Zealand if New Zealand Republic punished<br>New Zealand if labor didn't back down on<br>the policy<br>senior officials set out their<br>recommendations in four documents for<br>the labor government<br>the chief of Defense staff wrote on the<br>cover in the cover letter that quote in<br>the interests of security I've had only<br>three copies of each paper produced<br>the first copy was for the minister of<br>defense<br>the second for longing on this return<br>and he wrote I hold the third in my<br>office<br>I recommend that no wider access be<br>given to these papers until the Prime<br>Minister has considered their advice and<br>given Direction on how the manner should<br>be progressed<br>secrecy and timing are powerful tools of<br>bureaucratic influence<br>that thus after six months of<br>preparation the defense minister was<br>been given only the one weekend to mow<br>over the advice<br>long he would have been only a few hours<br>and no many other ministers would see<br>the papers before the decision was made<br>only one option was offered the<br>officials had stacked the process in<br>their favor<br>notices notice that this meant that the<br>only cabinet minister indeed the only<br>person<br>who is to be allowed to see the senior<br>officials advice before cabinet met and<br>long he arrived was the minister of<br>defense<br>and then something incredibly lucky<br>happened<br>which is where we move into the new<br>information<br>on that final<br>faithful weekend<br>out of the blue<br>my phone rang<br>he was a labor party politician named<br>Franco Flynn who might have no close<br>conflict close contact with before<br>he asked if I was free to visit him at<br>his home and Grant Road Wellington<br>he said it was urgent<br>when I'd arrived and was sitting in this<br>very neat living room he said he had the<br>bundle of advice from the officials on<br>whether to accept the U.S the U.S ship<br>visit but he said he wasn't sure what to<br>make of the advice or what he should do<br>without confidentially read the official<br>documents he had received and tell him<br>what I thought<br>and so there I was reading the secret<br>advice that almost no one else had seen<br>two Ministry of Defense documents were<br>stamped secret and two more came from<br>the external intelligence Bureau Franco<br>Flynn was breaking the law by showing<br>them to me I was a little bemused<br>wondering why he had trusted me<br>and I was engrossed in the documents<br>the papers named the ship that the U.S<br>Navy wanted to visit New Zealand a<br>destroyer called the USS Buchanan<br>I recognize the name which only weeks<br>ago earlier I'd included in the<br>Coalition against nuclear warships list<br>of all U.S nuclear warships and<br>submarines that were banned from New<br>Zealand under the nuclear free policy<br>the official advice also had 36 pages of<br>facts and arguments all supporting the<br>ship visit proposal I supporting the<br>ship visiting<br>I therefore offer you for your<br>consideration the chief of Defense staff<br>Jameson wrote my assessment to them is<br>that my assessment that it was most<br>unlikely that the USS Buchanan at the<br>time of its proposed visit to New<br>Zealand would carry any nuclear weapons<br>it was exactly what we'd feared there<br>was no mention of the step-by-step plan<br>to undermine the ban but with<br>increasingly blatant nuclear armed ships<br>nor was they mentioned that the U.S<br>Secretary of State had said over time<br>you would have to assume some of our<br>vessels would be carry nuclear arms<br>there was actually no discussion at all<br>of pros and cons there was not a single<br>mention of the option of adopting a<br>strong nuclear free policy no other<br>options of any kind were provided<br>the government basically had been<br>maneuvered into a corner where it was<br>hard to say no they've agreed to the<br>officials conducting the six-month<br>diplomatic negotiations implying that<br>the nuclear free policy was open to<br>negotiation and that compromise was<br>possible<br>the Americans would feel messed around<br>and were likely to punish the country if<br>the labor government stood firm it was<br>classic bureaucratic Stitcher it was a<br>classic bureaucratic stitch up the kind<br>where the officials usually win<br>Foreign Affairs had already drafted a<br>letter announcing the ship visit<br>there was of course no letter already<br>drafted for the government the kind in<br>the ship visit<br>but something unpredictable has happened<br>which was Frank Franco Flynn inviting me<br>to his home at the critical moment when<br>official secrecy should have been<br>depriving him of support and advice<br>after months of living and breathing<br>these things I was well prepared to help<br>them figure out how to protect the<br>Mercury free policy which is what he<br>wanted to do<br>there were two crucial things I was able<br>to tell him<br>first I explained exactly why accepting<br>the Buchanan would be the end of the<br>nuclear free policy I said that once one<br>possible nuclear arms ship was allowed<br>to visit even if maybe not very likely<br>that first time New Zealand would never<br>be able to say no to all the other<br>possibly nuclear around warships and<br>submarines<br>over time it would become evident to<br>everyone that we had a japan-style<br>nuclear-free policy meaning a nuclear<br>free policy only a name<br>it was a trick to win the nuclear free<br>policy<br>showing them the secret documents I<br>directed them to the only sentence that<br>really mattered which is where Jameson<br>had written that he could quote give no<br>absolute guarantee that the ship does<br>not carry nuclear warheads<br>this was the line he could take the<br>cabinet<br>the other thing I was able to suggest to<br>our friend also proved to be important<br>as I've said after six months of work<br>the government was being presented with<br>only one option the longer wait the<br>captain meeting had no alternative<br>proposals no option b to choose instead<br>I had an idea for a plan<br>when I'd researched the list of all the<br>nuclear armed and powered U.S Navy ships<br>most U.S Navy ships and submarines in<br>fact by far were installed with nuclear<br>weapon systems<br>but I remember the one modern class of<br>guided missile frigates that had no<br>nuclear weapon systems was called the<br>Oliver Hazard Perry class remember this<br>name<br>I suggested to my friend I suggested to<br>Franco Flynn that he propose the cabinet<br>that they reject the visit by the<br>Buchanan but tell the Americans that the<br>government would accept the visit by the<br>warship from the Oliver Hazard Perry<br>class which would clearly fit the New<br>Zealand policy<br>the ship could come and go without<br>breaching the nuclear free policy and if<br>it did come would not be there would not<br>be a precedent for later visits by<br>nuclear capable ships<br>so the labor government so the labor<br>potentially had an option b it gave them<br>a way out<br>I left Franco Flynn mowing over what to<br>do<br>this is how it played out<br>longing was still away that weekend with<br>no secure Communications<br>on the Sunday afternoon Deputy Prime<br>Minister Jeffrey Palmer hand typed the<br>letter to longy bringing them up to date<br>with the developments on a nuclear free<br>issue<br>it was hand delivered to longhi by a<br>trusted advisor as he returned to New<br>Zealand<br>years later Palmer's letter was released<br>on the official information act so we<br>know what he said<br>evidence about whether this vessel<br>carries nuclear weapons had been<br>assessed by individuals Palmer wrote<br>he said the evidence was enclosed<br>I have not yet seen it he said Frank has<br>meaning Franco Flynn he says it's his<br>view that the evidence was not<br>sufficient to convince the public that<br>it will not be carrying weapons and<br>therefore we should refuse the request<br>long he did not arrive arrive at cabinet<br>the next day<br>did not arrive at cabinet next day until<br>the afternoon the nuclear ship<br>discussion was surprisingly short<br>long he later said it was only about 15<br>minutes<br>it's clear that he and no Flynn simply<br>presented their conclusions to the rest<br>of the ministers<br>a report of the meeting records that<br>a report of the meeting records that<br>long he told cabinet the Buchanan was<br>not suitable and the intended to ask the<br>Americans for another ship one from the<br>Oliver Hazard Perry class<br>at the post cabinet press conference<br>long he declined to name the ship<br>proposed by the Americans but said that<br>there were vessels in the U.S Navy quote<br>modern recent fighting vessels which<br>were clearly unmistakably not nuclear<br>armed it was clear it was clear what<br>class of ships he was referring to<br>until the press conference officials had<br>no idea that their proposal to accept<br>except the Buchanan had been rejected<br>nor that an option b had appeared that<br>gave the government the way out of<br>having to accept the officials proposals<br>the next day long ago Flynn had a<br>meeting with the American ambassador<br>Monroe Brown<br>IE explained that there was insufficient<br>evidence that Buchanan would be not be<br>nuclear armed and he proposed instead<br>the visit by an Oliver Hazard Perry<br>frigate<br>our Flynn added that it would give the<br>opportunity for a port visit wasn't that<br>what the Americans wanted<br>the U.S ambassador blew up at the<br>suggestion saying no<br>we want to we want Port access access<br>what we want is resumption of the way we<br>operated the Anza says before<br>the U.S ambassador reluctantly agreed to<br>pass on the Oliver Hazard Perry proposal<br>to Washington<br>but the US government replied that the<br>only option was the Buchanan not a lot<br>of a hazard Terry frigate<br>there had never been any real chance<br>that the U.S was going to accept New<br>Zealand sticking to the nuclear free<br>policy<br>at this point longiformly refused to be<br>a Canon and the nuclear free policy was<br>Secure<br>the rest is well known<br>as the U.S retaliation began in the very<br>first days after Buchanan we'd have to<br>be kind of decision I finally understand<br>the press release as minister of defense<br>I sent out the press release as minister<br>of defense<br>the government's defense advisors left<br>the no doubt that the refusal to accept<br>visits by nuclear-capable ships with<br>almost inevitably resulting curtailment<br>by the U.S of current activities under<br>anzas he said the US might remove<br>concessions for military equipment<br>purchases but he was sure he was quote<br>sure most new zealanders will be willing<br>to pay the price to see the government<br>stand firm<br>he said exercises might also be canceled<br>and the flow of intelligence reduced or<br>stopped our defensive advisors warned us<br>of all these probable consequences of<br>our nuclear free policy he said we're<br>prepared for them and their cost and I'm<br>later that year the American government<br>very publicly expelled New Zealand from<br>the anzus alliance which I personally<br>the New Zealand officials kept trying in<br>secret through the rest of 1985 to<br>engineer a U.S warship visit and get the<br>step-by-step pan back on track<br>an overly aggressive reaction to the<br>nuclear ship ban by the U.S and<br>Australian governments and then the<br>Rainbow Warrior bombing the same year<br>that the U.S and British governments<br>refused to condemn had greatly<br>strengthened New Zealand Public support<br>for the nuclear free policy<br>it was for me one final mystery<br>surrounding the Buchanan decision<br>why had the Minister of Defense Franco<br>Flynn reached out to me at that crucial<br>moment<br>I learned the answer and the chance<br>meeting many years later<br>it wasn't that old friend that heard me<br>in the news or anything like that it was<br>something much more pleasingly in New<br>Zealand<br>back on that back on that January 1985<br>weekend Franco Flynn had been pacing<br>around this house and Grant Road<br>complaining to his family that he didn't<br>know what to make of the advice he was<br>reading I was told he asked who can I<br>talk to who would be trustworthy<br>it was<br>it was Frank's daughter Bridget o Flynn<br>who had the idea<br>some years earlier she'd been a<br>postgraduate student in the philosophy<br>department at Victoria University you<br>at the same time as I was in the post<br>postgraduate history of philosophy we<br>sat around and talked sometimes it was<br>her where sir she told her father she<br>knew me and I'd be reliable she's always<br>been proud about that and had wanted to<br>tell me<br>she had connected us up at the right<br>moment<br>were friends for the rest of his life<br>there was a warmth between us when we<br>met which I think was in part an<br>acknowledgment that I'd kept off meeting<br>secrets<br>later when he left Wellington he invited<br>me to his house again<br>this time he gave me all the boxes of<br>his papers from his time as Minister of<br>Defense there were gold mine including<br>important New Zealand izone documents<br>that would later go into my first book<br>likewise by the way as another sign of<br>the personal Goodwill coming out of<br>those years David long he wrote the<br>forward for that first book<br>I want to say a few words of Praise<br>about the little remembered Franco Flynn<br>he was solidly in the progressive labor<br>party tradition on foreign policy in<br>1984 for not in September 1984 for<br>instance as the nuclear decision<br>approached he gave the foreign policy<br>speech that enraged U.S officials<br>since World War II he said New Zealand<br>has been part of quote a kind of United<br>States protectorate<br>but the country was quote no longer<br>under any obligation for traditional or<br>historical reasons to recognize every<br>enemy of Britain or the United States as<br>our enemy at all times<br>you're interested in New Zealand not get<br>thrown into Global and Regional packs<br>all over the world<br>the modern labor party in my opinion<br>these more people who understand and<br>care about foreign policy as much as he<br>did<br>um<br>partly because we won't have time for<br>questions which I look forward to before<br>I finish there's a final point I want to<br>make<br>in those first years of the Lonely labor<br>government an informal group of senior<br>officials was formed to try to stop the<br>nuclear-free policy harming the ends<br>this Alliance<br>they were all the most senior officials<br>responsible for New Zealand's military<br>and foreign policy<br>to be specific the group consisted that<br>the Secretary of Foreign Affairs moved<br>nourish<br>the chief of Defense staff Ewan Jamison<br>the Secretary of Defense Dennis McCain<br>and the head of the prime minister's<br>Department Gerald Hensley they met<br>informally during The crucial six-month<br>period devising and attempting to push<br>this was for me as someone involved the<br>biggest lesson I had from the experience<br>I'd had a growing realization about who<br>we were up against I realized that the<br>greatest opponents of the nuclear free<br>policy were not the National Party<br>or some you know crazy pro-military<br>group or even the U.S government our<br>greatest opponents were the New Zealand<br>officials<br>they were also the greatest opponents of<br>the government they were supposed to<br>serve a government that had campaigned<br>and been elected on the promise of a<br>Nuclear Ban and there was then trying to<br>fulfill its promise<br>this is an important New Zealand story<br>an understanding it helps us to<br>understand more widely that something's<br>very wrong with defense and foreign<br>policy in New Zealand<br>we have a government based on the pr on<br>the principle of Civilian control of the<br>military<br>and equally government control of<br>Foreign Affairs but the events I've<br>described today are about senior<br>officials who believe they knew best and<br>more worryingly who felt entitled to<br>trick<br>block and steer the government to pursue<br>the policies they preferred<br>they seem to assume<br>and in Franco Flynn's words a kind of<br>United States protectorate we're doing<br>what the United States or Britain wanted<br>was more important than thinking about<br>and pursuing what was best for New<br>Zealand<br>or to put another way they thought that<br>what was best for New Zealand was doing<br>whatever the United States and Britain<br>wanted of us<br>this attitude hasn't changed<br>in the decades since the nuclear ships<br>Showdown<br>I've seen the same thing again and again<br>strong political leaders can sometimes<br>wrestle control like Helen Clark<br>refusing to join the invasion of Iraq<br>when military and Foreign Affairs staff<br>were reflexively trying to push New<br>Zealand into it<br>but on most issues most of the time the<br>same non-democratic grouping of the<br>heads of Defense Foreign Affairs and<br>Department the Prime Minister and<br>cabinet have far more influence over<br>over defense and foreign policy than the<br>elected politicians and vast in more<br>influence<br>the members of the public<br>take for example the recent move to have<br>New Zealand become a NATO partner in the<br>so-called indo-pacific<br>or the move to have our small sales<br>resignation during the anti-china orcas<br>Alliance<br>I see these as driven almost entirely by<br>pro-american officials<br>it was the same with my personal<br>personal experience in the operation<br>Burnham inquiry which investigated my<br>book on civilian casualties in<br>Afghanistan and found that indeed<br>civilian casualties and torture had been<br>hidden and denied<br>as I went through that inquiry I became<br>aware and later confirmed under the<br>official Information Act that there was<br>an informal grouping of guests the<br>Secretary of Foreign Affairs the SEC<br>chief of Defense Forces Secretary of<br>Defense the head of the Department of<br>prime minister and cabinet<br>the same configuration as fought the<br>nuclear ship ban this time fighting<br>every step of the way to try to stop<br>critical findings about the actions of<br>our sis actions of our SAS and the U.S<br>led War<br>and believe it or not some of those<br>senior officials<br>particularly in foreign affairs still<br>have their eyes on the nuclear free<br>policy<br>so most of this lecture has been about<br>some important and triumphant history<br>history that deserves to be told from<br>the perspective of the labor of the<br>longer government and the public<br>but I also want to urge that we learn<br>from this history and realize that very<br>serious reform is needed to our<br>present-day military and foreign policy<br>bureaucracy<br>um thank you Nikki so much for our<br>wonderful lecture it's been um I think a<br>real privilege to have you here with us<br>and to um have the opportunity to listen<br>to your personal Reflections<br>um which is fantastic<br>um and um to have an opportunity to kind<br>of I really hear from your perspective<br>of what's going on behind the scenes at<br>the time we do have a little bit of time<br>for questions Nikki is being very kind<br>and generous and allowing us an<br>opportunity to have a bit of q a<br>um so John and I are going to be<br>managing that as best possible I have<br>very terrible eyesight for distance so<br>John is going to tell me where to run to<br>to kind of bring this microphone to you<br>so that you can ask any questions that<br>you wish<br>um so please feel free to<br>um ask away well we've got the just over<br>thanks very much for that talk I really<br>enjoyed it thanks<br>um<br>can you remind us when the Rainbow<br>Warrior was was it in 1985 and do you<br>think that there was any tie up with<br>what you're talking about here and can<br>you elaborate a little bit on the degree<br>to which the Americans<br>were a sort of punitive and uh you know<br>um<br>I don't think that anyone engineered the<br>Rainbow Warrior bombing to try to<br>influence New Zealand that was the<br>French government and its great wisdom<br>but what they did so when it was it was<br>a it was a shocking thing they did but<br>it had an unintended consequence which<br>it meant that really took the new<br>Carefree policy from being something<br>which maybe half the population believed<br>in to something which most of the<br>population believed in so unintended<br>consequences were off the scale<br>um what was the second half of your<br>yeah<br>well this was also interesting the<br>Americans punished us<br>they didn't have trade sanctions for<br>example which would have just seemed<br>kind of like too over the top<br>but they did like they cancel the<br>exercises they<br>um they cut off some intelligence so<br>they're not as much as they said<br>um they made very angry noises but the<br>thing about it was the important thing<br>to remember from a New Zealand point of<br>view is that it wasn't for New Zealand<br>consumption<br>the reason they did it was not to<br>influence New Zealand the reason they<br>did it was because they were scared that<br>Japan might follow us<br>or Denmark or all those other countries<br>which would like to have a similar<br>policy which had been talked out of it<br>and so what we was what we got was<br>really a retaliation which was a lack of<br>regard for New Zealand a disinterest in<br>New Zealand and and really just kind of<br>bashing us and making sure that they<br>showed how mad they were to try to stop<br>other countries doing the same so we<br>were it was um<br>we were just a convenient way of um<br>I wonder what your old friend Franco<br>Flynn would have thought of Andrew<br>little when he was challenged about the<br>recent discussions over cozying up to<br>Nato and August he says I know whose<br>side we're on<br>I can tell you Franco Flynn turned in<br>that's too many people I'm going to go<br>to the front and then I'm going to come<br>thank you for your talk Nikki<br>um as I'm from Japan I'm very<br>disappointed to hear how not great our<br>policy is and as you might know I mean<br>this nuclear policy I don't think covers<br>nuclear power stations but I was<br>wondering if you have any advice on<br>um<br>as you might know currently Japanese<br>government is releasing the contaminated<br>water into the Pacific and I wonder what<br>role New Zealand could play in sport<br>robot<br>uh what role New Zealand government<br>could play to stop the new Japanese<br>government from releasing this nuclear<br>water to the Pacific because<br>Pacific is obviously connected to New<br>Zealand okay<br>um<br>we talked about Japan and nuclear<br>weapons I think it's really important<br>really important for us and for Japan to<br>recognize what Japan is and kind of<br>great power competition<br>which is that if you know Japan if<br>you've been there I've traveled around<br>Japan and gone to military bases and<br>gone to intelligence bases and Japan<br>essentially functions as a as a<br>permanent aircraft carrier off the coast<br>of China and so the um<br>um<br>so it's a the story about about Japan<br>being not properly nuclear free is just<br>part of a much bigger story of being<br>being<br>um<br>permanently available in numerous ways<br>to the United States military<br>on what you're saying about the the<br>Japanese government<br>proposing to release the contaminated<br>Wars front to the Pacific<br>I would have I mean you've already<br>thinking this yourself I would have<br>hoped that New Zealand and other<br>countries would put aside either trade<br>and other thoughts and make a much<br>louder noise than they have been that's<br>thank you for pointing me in the right<br>direction I told you I have really bad<br>eyesight<br>now where am I going up here all the way<br>hello um thank you very much for this<br>wonderful lecture but um I'm just<br>wondering about your thoughts as in<br>future as Don Brash elegantly put it<br>about the worries that the New Zealand<br>nuclear policy could be gone by<br>lunchtime<br>together<br>I would say of all the policies all the<br>policies which are sort of were created<br>by the<br>um the left side of politics it's one of<br>the safest ones from change<br>it's<br>go luckily I believe this luckily it has<br>gone from being<br>fragile to being very solid and I and I<br>don't think that's changed<br>generationally I think it's just the<br>kind of cemented in and out and it's a<br>it's a kind of a really solid part<br>of the non-anglo-american<br>mainstream of New Zealand thought and<br>self-perception and things so I I don't<br>I don't feel it's an<br>um great peril<br>at all<br>however<br>the reason I mentioned about some people<br>in foreign affairs having their eyes on<br>the policy so I've been hearing stories<br>in Wellington which have amazed me which<br>is that after all these years<br>they still there are people there who<br>still want to undo that the offense of<br>New Zealand acting independently like<br>that so so while I feel a higher<br>confidence that they won't get away with<br>it I think that there either are now or<br>there will be attempts yet again of the<br>thanks<br>um<br>up here<br>um very long way away<br>um I hope this question's okay it's not<br>directly related to go for your life<br>okay great<br>um you mentioned the flotilla and the<br>peace protests against the ship on in<br>August 1983. yeah<br>um<br>and we have such a strong history of<br>activism in this country but yet now<br>we're<br>experiencing kind of what I would view<br>as<br>uh just my apathy<br>um<br>I know you're running offended we're<br>part of a fantastic campaign that's<br>going on at the moment but I'm just<br>wondering how do you think we might<br>reinvigorate<br>um<br>and re-energize that momentum again for<br>you know what we had I mean you know I<br>was like 14 back there and just an aura<br>of what was happening around the country<br>and I was in Auckland and then there was<br>the Rainbow Warrior thing and the<br>Springbok tour and you know before that<br>and<br>and now I just feel<br>like I'm constantly pushing the boat up<br>the wrong way of the stream and<br>yeah<br>I understand a lot of people feel like<br>you do<br>I I totally do not buy the theory that<br>they were the good old days and they're<br>gone<br>I just don't believe that I don't<br>believe that for a second I think that<br>what's the answer<br>organize organize organize and keep<br>organizing that's the answer and it<br>that's what the right does when the<br>right wants to go somewhere and that's<br>what the left does when the sort of<br>environmentalists do it's the answer and<br>if and if something's not working then<br>try a new way that's what I think<br>and we and we are to other people<br>um politics is a social activity<br>if people don't see anyone else being<br>active then they live other lives and<br>they don't realize it could be part of<br>their lives and if they see people being<br>active and achieving things within their<br>what they believe in it and they want to<br>be part of it and so the best way to<br>make more people activists to be active<br>ourselves and to keep on being active<br>getting there<br>um thanks so much Nikki um for that talk<br>um I just wanted you touched on it<br>briefly but it's The Echoes of this<br>period with the current kind of August<br>um developments<br>um but I guess the interesting parallel<br>is you know you know Franco Flynn<br>talking about new zealanders are going<br>to protector it is it's kind of<br>happening in the Heyday of kind of U.S<br>hegemony<br>and kind of orcas is actually a kind of<br>representation of a kind of declining us<br>hegemony so how<br>what what are your thoughts basically on<br>how what is Arcus Arcus what is New<br>Zealand's relationship to ocus and what<br>might be the way that we actually<br>deal with haucus or what might be a path<br>forward for New Zealand by what sorry<br>will be a path forward for New Zealand<br>in<br>all right first of all I don't think the<br>United States for a moment thinks that<br>that the sun is sitting on it<br>the fact that it's going the other way<br>at the moment in our region and that the<br>confrontation with China is<br>as you all know<br>um being pushed and pushed and pushed<br>and pushed and pushed<br>not this in a way which could resolve<br>and go away at some stage but at the<br>moment it's not<br>um<br>oh sorry I'm tired what was your<br>well I've got a very particular view of<br>this I think<br>I think that we I've said this before<br>you may have heard me say I think we've<br>got there are two really separate tracks<br>in New Zealand<br>of foreign policy thought<br>and one is the nuclear free more<br>independent don't go off to Iraq we<br>don't have to do those things we don't<br>why on Earth would we want to be part of<br>a war with China Etc there's one trick<br>which I would say has the vast majority<br>of the public there<br>and then there's another Trek which<br>we've usually acts by stealth because<br>it's not very popular<br>and doesn't really<br>um<br>doesn't doesn't try the debase in public<br>very much because it's not going to make<br>it its way which is represented more by<br>the officials and some of the you know<br>the specialist interests around the<br>American Alliance<br>I think with the things like this the<br>answer lies<br>the power the<br>the sort of these two great the great<br>sort of river of of where new zealanders<br>are going which is towards a more<br>independent more Polynesian country and<br>the southern stuck in the anger American<br>past<br>and what I what I think and what it's<br>the same with August and it's the same<br>with everything is it the only reason<br>why they can make progress<br>on the<br>on the anglo-american track the main<br>reason they can is by secrecy most of<br>those things are not debated most of<br>those things are not known or at least<br>not until afterwards most of them if<br>they are going are Justified with<br>with fake excuses which to trying hard<br>to kind of find some point of contact<br>with where the public feels like maybe<br>that we're helping Make a Better World<br>by being in Afghanistan or something you<br>know um but basically there as long if<br>that can be done and quiet and secret<br>they will keep going and so it can't be<br>done in secret it won't keep going<br>and that vampires an obvious strategy we<br>have to talk about them more and I think<br>I would um<br>the world's got so many interesting<br>things to work on<br>that we that we've had we've gone<br>through a period where there haven't<br>been many people who have been focusing<br>um and so what's the answer it's the<br>answer is that there is this great ocean<br>in New Zealand Public and belief and<br>culture and things which is heading away<br>from that kind of world which is ready<br>to be tapped by people who are active<br>but there need to be people who are<br>writing talking thinking and doing<br>and then we will get our way that's what<br>sorry I have to run around the other<br>thank you very much for that I I have a<br>question about if you can tell us<br>anything about the consequences for<br>Franco Flynn so after the after that<br>cabinet meeting his officials must have<br>thought where did he get this crazy idea<br>for a you know option b right and they<br>wouldn't have been stupid they would<br>have thought that he must have got it<br>from somewhere and I know that his the<br>rest of his political career was not<br>seen as a great success and I I wonder<br>if if that's just a coincidence or if<br>you maybe he told you something about<br>what happened afterwards<br>yes delightful actually<br>um we we've got luckily we have quite a<br>good record of what the officials<br>thought because three of them wrote<br>books about it they were so frustrated<br>that they're lost<br>I've just reread those books preparing<br>for this<br>and they had all sorts of variations of<br>trying to work out where the Oliver<br>but that doesn't matter anyway but the<br>point is that they<br>they were they were deeply aggrieved<br>that they had gotta maneuvered out of it<br>somehow<br>um<br>did it hurt Frank I find I don't think<br>so he said to me he was he was a modest<br>man he said to me when he'd been<br>empowerment a bit longer he said won't<br>be long now and I'll be writing letters<br>you know that's okay I'll just keep<br>trying in the way I can so he he doesn't<br>seem to me to be to have suffered at all<br>he was he was happy with his work and he<br>thank you very much that was fascinating<br>I I just wondered<br>when you were in Dunedin this time or<br>maybe next time you might like to have a<br>think about an interesting source<br>and that is the records of the labor<br>party here in Dunedin you know because<br>the thing that drives us most crazy in<br>some ways a little bit in Dunedin is<br>what I've invent a new word I call it<br>aucklandism<br>and it's a suggestion that the only<br>thing that ever counts in place that<br>counts in New Zealand is Auckland which<br>is certainly nonsense and one thing that<br>would prove this wrong is the big record<br>that they've got at the hocken library<br>which is held in lettuce and in part in<br>the in the Michael Cullen and Stan<br>Rogers collection but also more<br>generally just labor party stuff that<br>will show you that ranchers around here<br>um lots of them were continually<br>um<br>sending support to David long and<br>sometimes criticism uh to make sure that<br>the thing happened<br>so there was an awful lot of support you<br>know from this little city uh for the<br>policy and and because it is an old<br>labor City<br>on the whole and uh<br>as a result of that uh I think that that<br>quite a lot happened and it might even<br>strengthen your understanding a little<br>bit more just to give it a little<br>Southern flavor as it were which would I<br>think I think uh be quite interesting<br>anyway I'll talk to you about it later<br>anyway<br>well you've been told off<br>well actually I was going to say I was<br>going to say I was going to say thank<br>you for the suggestion but I prefer to<br>thank you for the suggestion<br>thank you so much<br>um have you ever considered standing for<br>politics yourself<br>or do you believe that you're more<br>effective in your current role being<br>outside as a resource person<br>well you've answered my question<br>yes I've<br>I think that some people have to be in<br>politics but but this is actually an<br>important comment<br>it's good to have some people in<br>politics but they only do a small part<br>of the politics of change<br>I was and maybe and this is my one<br>objection to MMP for example is that the<br>more parties we have the more emphasis<br>we have on par on empowerment<br>the more the higher proportion of<br>intelligent motivated people are doing<br>their politics through political parties<br>and Parliament<br>and actually most change if we think<br>about it has come out of movements<br>how come other researchers and the<br>spokespeople and the organizers and the<br>meeting organizers and the left foot<br>writers and the MP visitors and all the<br>rest of it and if we want to have change<br>we don't need more people in the<br>political process we need more people in<br>that part<br>so so I should practice what I preach<br>yeah I think that's a really wonderful<br>way to end and very inspiring um as well<br>so it's I have the opportunity here to<br>kind of have the floor and say thank you<br>very much Nikki for your wonderful talk<br>um I love the new zealanders of it the<br>smallness of New Zealand Thank You<br>Bridget o'flynn yeah heroin of New<br>Zealand history who should be remembered<br>thank you Franco Flynn for reaching out<br>to you as well thank you for sharing<br>your personal views and being generous<br>uh with your time and for answering<br>questions with us as well and what I<br>took from that is some from your talkers<br>and from the questions is the need for<br>us to constantly be writing questioning<br>thinking and being critical and that's<br>what the humanities is about that's what<br>history is about so thank you very much<br>for kind of reinforcing the value I<br>think of the humanities and the work<br>that we do in universities as well so I<br>want to just thank you very much for<br>what a wonderful lecture and for<br>spending time with us tonight so please<br>I think a standing ovation is deserved<br>so it's uh I just now had to bring<br>things to a close I mean I don't want to<br>kind of stamp down on the kind of<br>awesomeness of this um kind of event in<br>terms of the<br>um the atmosphere itself but um I think<br>what Nikki has done is show us really<br>importantly the kind of invisible labor<br>of kind of political work I think is<br>often forgotten so thank you for for<br>doing that I also have a few people to<br>thank apart from Nikki for helping put<br>this event together a really critical<br>person is Sandra Burgess who doesn't<br>like having attention but she is our<br>administrator in history and she's made<br>this magic of tonight really happen so a<br>round of applause for Sandra<br>foreign<br>thank you to all the IT people and the<br>um external engagement division the<br>division of humanities and everyone out<br>there who's helped kind of promote this<br>event thank you John very much for all<br>your help in making this happen as well<br>and thank you all for coming tonight<br>it's been a real pleasure
