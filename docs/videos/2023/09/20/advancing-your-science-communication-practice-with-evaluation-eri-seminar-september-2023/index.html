However, other research and teaching obligations limit the time and resources available to invest in science communication efforts, making the effectiveness of these efforts a key concern. Evaluation can not only assess the effectiveness of science communication efforts, but can also be used for learning from and improving efforts, as well as for strategizing, planning, and managing projects and programs, and as a mechanism to lobby for institutional support. However, to the time-limited researcher or novice to science communication, taking the next step to evaluate their activities can seem daunting. My research focuses on making evaluation of science communication more feasible, useful, and practice-able. I will share theory- based, actionable methods for incorporating evaluation into science communication practice, whether you are interested in evaluating your own activities or prefer to work with a professional, and highlight how evaluation can support your science communication and help meet your goals.<br><br>Jessica Rohde is a PhD Candidate at Victoria University of Wellington School of Science and Society where her research is focused on evaluation of science communication. While earning her M.S. in Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington, she discovered her calling for science communication by giving a public talk on her salmon migration research. She then taught a graduate level course in science communication and led a collaboration with the courseâ€™s students to crowdfund an evaluation of the course and publish the evaluation. Her current research aims to make evaluation more accessible, useful, and practice-able for both science communicators and scientist-communicators.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

today apparently at the<br>University of waikato<br>um so Jess is here visiting us from the<br>school it's a student right yeah School<br>of uh science in society uh from<br>Victoria University of Wellington<br>um and her research is all about trying<br>to evaluate how people do science<br>communication uh and engagement with<br>communities so basically making it more<br>practicable is that the word is that how<br>I said practice Champion to that I don't<br>know we're sure to explain it to us I'm<br>sure<br>um so Jess is originally from Seattle uh<br>in the US and she did her Bachelor of<br>Arts in biology at Colorado College<br>um she's switched over to doing<br>Fisheries science<br>um Masters at the University of<br>Washington and looked at seven migration<br>patterns and her own backyard pretty<br>much because she grew up<br>um and then she kind of Switched<br>research directions again<br>um she did a course during her Masters<br>on science communication and public<br>speaking taking and kind of realized<br>that was a interest of hers so she then<br>took up a job as a community manager for<br>a interdisciplinary group of researchers<br>who all worked in the Arctic and she so<br>she did that for five years<br>um but actually ended up kind of<br>combining that with her love of<br>traveling so she was a digital Nomad<br>probably one of the the OG digital<br>Nomads um travel in the world for about<br>five years before she ended up here in<br>New Zealand right as uh the pandemic hit<br>in early 2020 and so decided kind of<br>that was her time to start her PhD so<br>she's been doing her PhD since and<br>science communication<br>um and just as here because<br>um she's actually using me as a guinea<br>pig for one of her case studies for her<br>PhD so trying to figure out how we can<br>evaluate science communication um<br>and from lots of different perspectives<br>and so she's been helping me kind of<br>figure out ways that I can uh evaluate<br>whether Outreach and engagement efforts<br>on rickohu or fuddy Cody Chatham Islands<br>um is and to actually be effective you<br>don't know the answer there yet<br>um but yeah I'll hand over to you Jess<br>and thank you all very much for your<br>patience I'm really sorry about the wave<br>um but it's so nice to see all these<br>familiar faces<br>um and I really appreciate your<br>hospitality for the past some it's been<br>three weeks now<br>um and you've all been really welcoming<br>yes great yeah my voice feels really<br>good<br>testing<br>but thanks<br>all right so yes I am a PhD candidate<br>they have given me that title now<br>however this is the first time that I've<br>ever talked about my PhD research so<br>I'm very excited to see what you guys<br>think and because I'm researching<br>evaluation I'd really like to know your<br>harshest criticisms at the end so that I<br>can improve it I meant to bring paper<br>that you could write notes down on but<br>you have something that's really harsh<br>and you don't want to say it to my face<br>maybe just say it to Chrissy and then<br>she'll pass it on to me anonymously<br>yeah so Chrissy covered this a little<br>bit so I'll go quickly I'm from Seattle<br>and I studied Fisheries ecology and I<br>traveled a lot and I like diving in<br>caves<br>okay<br>and I took a little detour while I was<br>doing my masters and I was really lucky<br>that the grad students at my University<br>created a science communication course<br>because one didn't exist yet and they<br>wanted it to exist they really just<br>started out teaching each other and then<br>they were like this is actually a thing<br>let's let's make it a course and then<br>they partnered with this local venue<br>called town hall and so all the students<br>gave their final Capstone presentation<br>about their research in front of a<br>public audience and so that was my first<br>I am scariest public speaking event that<br>I ever did but it was awesome to tell<br>people about the research that I was so<br>excited about<br>um and that group of students really had<br>this kind of magic to it because we<br>created this thing so we just kept<br>creating things we crowdfunded an<br>evaluation of the I'm gonna move that up<br>a little bit<br>of the course and published it and that<br>was my first<br>publication that wasn't in Fisheries<br>that was in science communication and<br>from there I had to wait around a little<br>bit until I finally decided it was time<br>to do the PHD again I wonder if we can<br>yeah anyway so<br>this might look familiar to you this is<br>um the peak in covet infections and this<br>little dot is when I crossed the border<br>into New Zealand just by I think it was<br>like four days before the shutdown<br>happened and I didn't leave for three<br>years and since then I've left but now<br>I'm so extremely happy to be here<br>because well of course that year of<br>lockdowns and uncertainty was really<br>hard on everybody but I felt like there<br>was no better science Community I mean<br>there was no better disease-free place<br>to be in the world but also there was no<br>better science communication place to be<br>in the world because<br>New Zealand relied on science and<br>empathy I just think that's such a great<br>that's a great sound bite<br>um and Sean hendy who's also part of TPM<br>and is really inspirational like that<br>that just makes me really emotional to<br>to know that he felt like I did<br>something to help save lives<br>um<br>so<br>I really like this quote because<br>should I read it or should I let you<br>read it<br>we ask scientists and especially young<br>scientists to communicate their work get<br>a Blog report a podcast write an op-ed<br>speak with elected officials and more if<br>everyone does this and succeeds the<br>result will be noise one big challenge<br>for science communication is to develop<br>mechanisms that produce music not noise<br>just as a symphony does<br>and I like that quote because I think<br>science communication especially for<br>people who are just researchers in their<br>day job and are trying to squeeze in<br>science communication when they have<br>time<br>it can be a little haphazard and you can<br>forget that you actually have all of<br>these other<br>musicians around you that you can<br>collaborate with and team up with and<br>you don't have to go it alone and then<br>you can be more strategic and have more<br>of an impact with the science<br>communication that you're doing<br>um and so that's what really motivated<br>me to get into evaluation I think that's<br>how we make our science communication<br>so I wanted to start off with a little<br>bit of<br>interactivity<br>um I'm just going to ask a bunch of<br>types of science communication or other<br>words you might use our Outreach or<br>public engagement or informal Science<br>Education I'm just going to put them up<br>there and I would love it if you could<br>raise your hand if you've ever<br>participated in that and we're just<br>going to go through it quickly so<br>Science Festival<br>but we know we're going to push your<br>uh science cafe or public talk<br>nice<br>vlogs<br>okay<br>tweet or X or whatever yeah oh good yeah<br>what okay have you talked to a reporter<br>okay oh wow break you brave people have<br>you talked to a government official<br>I feel like the government is quite<br>accessible to scientists here<br>um have you ever done community-based<br>research oh cool oh great oh that's<br>awesome podcaster YouTube I had to throw<br>that in there because I know there's at<br>least one oh there's several okay cool<br>um and Outreach in schools<br>nice<br>that is awesome<br>I'm going to keep that in mind as we go<br>through the rest of<br>what we're going to talk about today<br>what we're going to talk about is what<br>the heck is evaluation<br>um it could be a little tricky to<br>explain maybe not quite as awkward as<br>trying to explain the birds and the bees<br>but um<br>I thought I'd start with some examples<br>of ways that you guys see evaluations in<br>your everyday life so if you're teaching<br>here you have students that are<br>evaluating your teaching and from what I<br>hear of that it's either you're the best<br>teacher in the world or you're the worst<br>teacher in the world right because<br>that's what motivates them to actually<br>do the evaluation so that can be kind of<br>rough<br>you also go through this peer review<br>process which is actually like several<br>phases of people<br>reviewing your hard work<br>um and I really like this Far Side comic<br>that streams lines it down to a little<br>um and evaluation often gets compared to<br>that death creature the Grim Reaper with<br>the Scythe because<br>um<br>I mean all the things I just described<br>are like not the most fun things that<br>you do in your job right it's pretty<br>much someone<br>external who comes in and tells you you<br>suppose they're going to tell you all<br>the ways that you're not meeting<br>expectations right<br>um<br>well the truth is<br>we actually evaluate all the time every<br>day we evaluate when we decide if we're<br>going to have a Michelin star meal or<br>girl dinner<br>um yeah anytime that you're comparing<br>some new information to some old<br>information and deciding how good or bad<br>it is you're evaluating informally<br>um so it's actually not that mysterious<br>um it's very similar to research oops<br>yeah both research and evaluation are<br>inquiry processes that look very similar<br>you develop some questions that you're<br>going to answer you collect some<br>evidence you analyze it and you answer<br>those questions and you report the<br>findings<br>so<br>well it might seem like there's some<br>mysterious external evaluator who comes<br>in and tells you what you're doing wrong<br>it's actually something that you're<br>perfectly anybody is perfectly capable<br>um<br>and there's one key thing that makes<br>evaluation different from research and<br>that is this thing called valuing<br>so<br>the researcher cannot tell you how<br>valuable your program is<br>so what does that mean<br>this lovely chap right there is Michael<br>scriven he's a very well-known evaluator<br>one of the fathers and he passed away<br>sadly about a month ago but he made this<br>really excellent quote bad as bad and<br>good is good and it's the job of the<br>evaluator to decide which is which I<br>feel like he was trying to explain it to<br>a five-year-old like that's just perfect<br>science Communication in my mind it's<br>basically just<br>deciding the relative<br>value worth interest<br>and the way that we make that systematic<br>and called an evaluation is through<br>something called a rubric so<br>we say exactly what it takes to be<br>scored at each level of goodness<br>so excellent would have to be I don't<br>actually have the criteria for getting<br>an excellent grade in there but you<br>would have to really take your audience<br>into consideration and the context<br>um<br>and conveyor complex ideas simply and<br>clearly etc etc<br>and you make it transparent so that it<br>can be reproducible you said you say<br>exactly why you did what you did<br>so it's seems like a subjective<br>qualitative thing but this is how we<br>actually make it systematic and<br>quantitative and reproducible<br>so I wanted to switch gears and do<br>another little exercise and pretend<br>right now that we are having an amazing<br>science festival here in waikato<br>with some bugs and some phono uh<br>searching for invertebrates in the river<br>and hiking around and there's also<br>perhaps an amazing Storyteller that's<br>um<br>giving us some magic to the evening<br>and lots of science learning too of<br>course<br>now<br>one of the most common ways to evaluate<br>this type of science communication is to<br>send people a survey on a phone<br>and usually at the end when they're<br>leaving<br>um<br>so this is a typical survey and I just<br>wanted you to take a look and think<br>about it for a second and<br>just maybe just<br>is it any brave souls want to<br>tell me what they think about that yeah<br>it's a good big subjective term<br>yeah totally subjective any other words<br>doesn't<br>it doesn't represent the joy ah it<br>doesn't spark Joy doesn't represent Joy<br>we don't want to break any copyright<br>foreign<br>yeah yes<br>sorry yeah<br>it's people if they want to read that<br>was incredible yeah yeah because even if<br>you're like I was extremely Satisfied by<br>people isn't that just satisfied<br>yeah that's a good point yeah the lack<br>of emotion<br>I think I would even go so far as to say<br>that it's<br>really doesn't help it's not useful it's<br>not helpful it doesn't tell you anything<br>other than they were there and they<br>um and unfortunately<br>this well maybe not unfortunately the<br>thing about evaluation is you get what<br>you get out of it so if you're just<br>trying to go through your day and you<br>just want to get the survey out and you<br>want to get everybody to say five stars<br>yeah it was fine then that's the survey<br>for you but if you want to actually get<br>something out of your evaluation and<br>make it useful to you you probably want<br>to think a little bit harder about what<br>um<br>okay so I'll expand on this a little bit<br>more I think it's it's really easy to<br>especially with social media and<br>websites<br>to look at your followers your visitors<br>your impressions your retweets<br>um and to think oh wow that tweet got a<br>lot of retweets that was a good tweet<br>I'm doing good check science<br>communication look look Thunder lots of<br>tweets but again my main point was<br>you don't know anything about what that<br>person took away from it you don't know<br>anything about them you don't know if<br>they liked it or they disliked it you<br>don't know<br>um so I think when people think of<br>evaluation the low-hanging fruit are<br>these type of vanity metrics<br>and so one of my main takeaways for you<br>guys today is to try and think beyond<br>that to what kind of information could<br>actually help you and so<br>to start thinking about that<br>I wanted to give you another interactive<br>question which is<br>what do you ultimately in the long term<br>want to happen as a result of the<br>science communication you're doing<br>and if it's kind of hard to think that<br>far out maybe pick like one of the<br>things that you raised your hand for one<br>thing in particular and think you know<br>if that thing went really well<br>and I would love it if somebody would<br>share<br>yeah that's such a cool impact oh I love<br>it<br>yeah<br>typical<br>thing too<br>repeats it back to me in their own words<br>yeah<br>used and then yeah it's that it's that<br>level of learning where you're<br>what does anybody know it's like you're<br>digesting and<br>putting it in your own words you know<br>it's not digesting but we're talking<br>yeah that's a good one that's so it's<br>like that moment for you where<br>where you see that they're activated by<br>yeah<br>and especially if like it gets back to<br>that's neat<br>oh thank you so much<br>does this mean that they still can't see<br>the PowerPoint okay<br>um<br>I was happy to run I already worked up a<br>sweat today so I can run around<br>things<br>thank you guys for contributing so much<br>these are great<br>I feel like it's crazy<br>yeah also now I'm looking at the chat so<br>anybody on Zoom if you want to add your<br>okay so<br>um I just<br>because we have a bit of um time I I<br>think for me right because so most of my<br>science communication has been done I<br>think on a headcount basis with kids<br>um and so for me I would like to see<br>them view the world through a scientific<br>lens and ask why and how does this work<br>because when you're talking with kids<br>who are only 12 to 15 years old<br>um they're not going to make a<br>commitment and say I'm going to study<br>theoretical physics right yeah but if<br>you can get them to think about the<br>world in a way that's not so obvious<br>right away from information that people<br>want to feed to them as opposed to you<br>know and start thinking about well<br>how can I find out more about this for<br>myself yeah right and then more<br>importantly and now what what sustains<br>that is that Curiosity and then I think<br>for some kids knowing that they actually<br>have the the intellect and access to<br>resources<br>to answer those questions for themselves<br>because I think that's ultimately<br>what gets more people into science and I<br>think also importantly even if they<br>don't study science formally they carry<br>that attitude through their life and<br>start looking at the world through a<br>scientific lens yeah<br>um because scientists can generate all<br>the evidence we want but if the people<br>who are making the decisions they're not<br>viewing the world through a scientific<br>lens they're looking at the world<br>through ideological lens then none of<br>the evidence matters<br>that's a really<br>well said well thought out impact<br>I think if I would uh if I could<br>condense it to one where I'd say<br>inspiring curiosity right that's the key<br>word is or maybe critical thinking also<br>or maybe I would also say inspiring them<br>to become scientists<br>cool<br>anybody on the zoom want to share your<br>why you do science communication so I<br>think Lisa had Sid hasn't been a<br>behavior change or attitudinal change as<br>a result of the science communication<br>which is yeah similar to what well that<br>okay<br>I think I have one more<br>interactive part okay<br>well I was amazed at your ideas because<br>nobody said just increasing knowledge<br>have you all heard of the deficit model<br>of science communication no yes yes<br>um this is a model in science<br>communication theory that we often have<br>to debunk<br>um<br>I mean even I am guilty of this thinking<br>it's probably why I got into science<br>communication so<br>you come into science communication and<br>you think if I can just tell somebody<br>this knowledge that I know then they<br>will behave the way that they should be<br>if I can tell them that climate change<br>is real then they will reduce their<br>emissions and<br>what the research shows again and again<br>and again is just knowing about science<br>doesn't change your attitudes about it<br>it doesn't change your behavior towards<br>it<br>knowledge is not enough<br>but<br>knowledge and other engaging parts of<br>science communication can be enough so<br>sparking curiosity or getting them so<br>excited that they're explaining it back<br>to you or they're going and telling<br>their friend generally just things that<br>are like giving them a positive<br>experience while they're learning are<br>the types of things that help so none of<br>you even set any goals that were just<br>like raise awareness so you're already<br>way ahead of the game<br>um<br>some other goals that you might think of<br>in the long term although these are<br>admittedly hard to<br>um they're very long term and hard to<br>evaluate you know if this was a result<br>of your science communication or not but<br>speaking particular policy positions<br>more funding for your area of research<br>in general<br>Health outcomes such as preventing<br>pandemics promoting science's career we<br>got that one and I also like the<br>the goal of making science and science<br>communication more inclusive and<br>equitable<br>um and you guys have great ideas so<br>unless anybody wants to pipe up with one<br>last<br>yeah<br>there<br>okay<br>Switching gears again<br>so the definition that we used before is<br>evaluation is research plus valuing<br>another way that evaluation can be<br>defined is it's a method for measuring<br>your progress towards your goals and we<br>just talked about some of our goals so<br>now we can think about how we can get<br>there<br>um<br>this<br>research and theory has been really<br>influential to my thinking around<br>evaluation it's by John Wesley and<br>Anthony dudo and their strategic<br>communicators and they've developed this<br>theory of strategic science<br>Communication in which you develop a<br>long-term behavioral goal which you guys<br>name some great ones like getting people<br>to stop squishing bugs and then you<br>think of some short-term measurable<br>objectives that would logically help<br>lead to that goal and those are usually<br>in the cognitive and effective domain so<br>like changing people's feelings about<br>something such as liking bugs having a<br>positive reaction to bugs when they see<br>them or just um cognitive means their<br>beliefs about<br>a topic so beliefs not in the religious<br>way but beliefs like I believe that bugs<br>are scary<br>um and then now I believe that bugs are<br>my friends and I don't want to kill them<br>that kind of belief<br>and then finally at the end of this<br>strategic progression we have tactics<br>and those are the things that most they<br>get the most press in science<br>communication you've probably heard that<br>to do good science communication you<br>should be telling a story you shouldn't<br>be using jargon you should be trying to<br>incorporate metaphor you should listen<br>and have a dialogue<br>these are all things that are on the<br>Tactical level<br>and so John bestley and dudo are trying<br>to<br>they're kind of on this mission to get<br>people who are doing science<br>communication science communicators to<br>think Beyond just telling a story to<br>their long-term goals and how they can<br>meet those with their strategic<br>thinking and their planning and their<br>objectives<br>oh I already did this without the slide<br>so that's explaining what tactics are<br>some of the goals that we talked about<br>are making Better Health choices and<br>environmental choices perhaps voting<br>informed voting<br>career choices and two other behaviors<br>that that might be interesting when<br>you're thinking about evaluating are<br>kind of pseudo behaviors they're not<br>actually somebody doing something it's<br>accepting science so not refuting it or<br>spreading disinformation being being<br>willing to say okay yes science has a<br>role in this topic that we're talking<br>about<br>um which is definitely a<br>a not actionable thing trust is<br>something that develops over time and<br>you can't really see it when it happens<br>but you have this feeling of trust<br>growing<br>so those are pseudo behaviors that could<br>be goals<br>man I just keep going ahead of my slides<br>it's because this is the first time I'm<br>doing this I'm sorry guys<br>um<br>oh okay this is great so those are the<br>types of<br>goals and objectives that you might<br>think of for your audience<br>but you might also have goals about<br>yourself<br>so for example if you're doing<br>community-based research<br>one of the major points of reasons for<br>doing that is to develop relationships<br>and build on the local knowledge of the<br>people in the community<br>so your behavior would be changed by<br>being exposed to different knowledge<br>systems new ways of thinking new culture<br>um and adapting to be more accepting or<br>welcoming of that<br>um<br>or being willing to in the<br>pseudo-behavior realm being willing to<br>foreign<br>Okay so we've got our long-term<br>behavioral goals and we've got tactics<br>which are the little things that you do<br>to to get to the goals but in the middle<br>we have these things that are kind of<br>the Black Box the cognitive and<br>effective objectives and bestly you<br>don't think that these are really the<br>key to doing strategic science<br>communication because they're the things<br>that are actionable and measurable and<br>you can do them in a relatively short<br>time so you can see whether you're<br>successful at them or not so I'm going<br>to give a little bit more time to this<br>slide when I'm talking about objectives<br>so at the very top left we've got just<br>sharing facts this is kind of like the<br>default control objective anytime you're<br>doing science communication you're<br>sharing knowledge some other things you<br>can do that can improve the success of<br>your science communication are being<br>really warm and benevolent and giving or<br>at least displaying that you're doing<br>that when you're up on stage trying to<br>offer a sense of warmth<br>um you can show that you have integrity<br>and are honest there are some people out<br>there who are worried that scientists<br>are getting paid billions of dollars and<br>that's why they're doing it so if you<br>can be really transparent about your<br>funding and other conflicts of interest<br>um<br>you might even prioritize you know<br>instead of spending more time to explain<br>a piece of research that you've done you<br>might take some time out from your talk<br>and be like here's all the sources of<br>funding that I have and here's where you<br>can find more about it and here's where<br>you can contact me to demonstrate that<br>you have a lot of integrity and you're<br>not hiding anything so you might<br>prioritize that kind of objective to a<br>different<br>audience<br>being willing to listen is a really<br>important one this is something that<br>I struggle with and really try<br>to use in especially in my relationships<br>with people who have opposite World<br>Views from me<br>um<br>I bet a lot of us struggle with<br>holding or well maybe kiwis don't<br>struggle with telling people that<br>they're wrong<br>you guys are very polite but I've found<br>that you know in the long run if you can<br>develop a relationship with somebody who<br>thinks differently from you by not<br>battling with them on something instead<br>just listening to their opinion and<br>making them feel heard then in the long<br>run they might actually want to listen<br>to your different opinion and it would<br>actually they'd be open to hearing about<br>it too because you were open to<br>listening to them first<br>very important objective<br>showing shared values showing that you<br>have something in common that your<br>identities are similar in some way<br>showing that you're competent researcher<br>so<br>showing that you have a lot of<br>Publications or<br>what have you<br>the last ones are a little bit more<br>advanced<br>and<br>honestly I wouldn't even feel<br>comfortable doing a lot of these things<br>without thinking it through quite a lot<br>first but<br>sharing risks and benefits so this is<br>the type of<br>tactic where you would<br>present<br>let's say ooh wildfires is a good one<br>I'm going back to the US next month and<br>it's Wildfire season there and when I<br>was growing up there were no wildfires<br>in the summer and now there are every<br>summer and we have to have air purifiers<br>in our house for the last two months of<br>the summer it's crazy<br>um<br>so you might share that that's a risk to<br>your health even if you're not close to<br>the smoke and can smell the smoke you<br>might there's actually research that<br>shows that it affects people's air<br>quality all across the northern us so<br>you could share that that's a risk even<br>if you think you're<br>protected from the effects of climate<br>change<br>or benefits a lot of people try to put<br>preventing the effects of climate change<br>in monetary<br>reform I forget what the word for that<br>is but um<br>risks and benefits and there's there's<br>some science to whether people perceive<br>losses to be worse than they perceive<br>benefits but that makes sense so you're<br>more afraid of losing something than you<br>are of gaining something that you<br>weren't expecting<br>um so that this is why this one is a<br>little bit more advanced sharing<br>normative beliefs this is<br>has anybody heard of normative beliefs<br>before<br>cool<br>yeah<br>um yeah<br>so I guess well do you want to tell me<br>what your explanation of norms would be<br>or or you don't have to you can you can<br>politely decline<br>okay so in social science there's<br>several different types of norms but<br>essentially it boils down to<br>perceiving a behavior by others as<br>normal so kind of<br>it has to do a little bit with identity<br>too is seeing something that somebody<br>else is doing as the normal thing so for<br>example if you walked into the lecture<br>hall and everybody was standing up<br>and not sitting down you'd probably I<br>mean there's there's research like<br>haven't you ever seen those crazy trick<br>things where they make people do crazy<br>things by just having everybody else in<br>the room do something weird and then<br>they end up doing it I mean it's<br>they're very powerful normative beliefs<br>are powerful<br>finally emotions are frames another<br>really Advanced topic because for<br>example in climate change<br>we all know that<br>we're so I mean we care about it but<br>we're so tired of hearing the the it's<br>not only that it's worse every single<br>day like that's old news<br>and you can only take so much before you<br>just have to go I don't want to hear it<br>anymore so in some instances it is<br>really powerful to get people's heart<br>strings going and to show them a polar<br>bear and that that does work in some<br>instances but you have to be really<br>strategic about is it too much is it<br>time for a different emotion now<br>and Frames means<br>portraying a topic<br>um in a way that relates to a different<br>topic that the person is interested in<br>we don't have an example off the top of<br>yeah I'm just going to skip that one<br>this is too long of a slide okay the<br>last one is cultivating self-efficacy<br>which just means like believing in<br>yourself that you're getting better when<br>you're doing something<br>it's actually important to you reaching<br>your goals to to continue believing that<br>you're improving<br>um so they picked this big set of I<br>think it's 12 objectives based on a<br>couple of social science theories that I<br>just wanted to show really quick the<br>integrative model of organizational<br>trust so the objectives that I shared of<br>portraying warmth and integrity and<br>listening and shared values those are<br>all things that will help build trust<br>and if you remember back on the behavior<br>slide<br>trust was sort of that<br>pseudo-behavior of accepting science and<br>being willing to to say okay science has<br>foreign<br>I I was looking forward to you saying<br>something about the Share value thing<br>you know you skipped it<br>um because I I have I feel that that's a<br>really really important skill to acquire<br>and I would argue that<br>the other five points that are currently<br>on the screen are all they're at the<br>Four Points all tied together but I<br>would put the scientific facts the last<br>so yeah right because as soon as people<br>realize who you are<br>they sort of assume that that's going to<br>be the first thing you do that you're<br>going to be preaching at them<br>and you need to break that expectation<br>right so first and foremost you talk to<br>people as people not as your students no<br>people who are intellectually inferior<br>and need your ninja need your your your<br>knowledge shower down on them right<br>um first of all basically treat them as<br>as you would treat your neighbor I mean<br>unless you lecture at your neighbor then<br>in English guys don't don't treat them<br>like your neighbor but treat them like<br>every person you would me right try and<br>find Common Ground first and then<br>finding that common ground of course<br>requires that you listen because if you<br>speak the whole time you don't know<br>where they stand<br>right and then when you when you say<br>when they say something that you<br>disagree with you would have to you<br>would have to disagree because if you<br>don't disagree you don't show that<br>Integrity right you you know because and<br>and there are people out there whose<br>beliefs will not be changed and then so<br>whether you disagree or agree with them<br>pretend to agree with them makes no<br>difference but you have to be honest<br>right that Honesty shows you into your<br>integrity but you have to be sympathetic<br>you have to understand where they come<br>from right so somebody whose family has<br>been in the oil business for a long long<br>time not a Barren but just a driller you<br>have to understand that this is what you<br>know they're they're scraping by and<br>this is the lifestyle that they know<br>right and so you can't be honest<br>empathetic and say well you're part of<br>the oil machine well that doesn't work<br>you're not convincing anybody<br>right so find out who you are and then<br>find out who they are<br>and then you can start finding share<br>values and identity and then you can<br>start thinking about working which parts<br>what facts and processes are relevant<br>for you for our discussion going forward<br>yeah<br>things I really appreciate your the way<br>that you tied all the<br>objectives together and the way that you<br>phrased<br>some really important<br>objectives and tactics of science<br>communication that sometimes I forget to<br>say because maybe I'm too close to the<br>to the subject yeah that was great to<br>hear that you're doing that and you<br>value that<br>um this is the other theory that they've<br>used to develop these and this theory is<br>probably one of the most popular<br>Behavior change theories in social<br>science however these are all for the<br>objectives that I was saying were a<br>little bit more tricky but like sharing<br>emotions and frames and normative<br>beliefs<br>so<br>that's just to tell you where the Theory<br>comes from<br>strategic set of I would call these<br>indicators in an evaluation you've got<br>the goals that you want to happen in the<br>long term the behavior changes that a<br>bunch of objectives to pick from which<br>are all focused on changing people's<br>beliefs and emotions<br>um and tactics that can back that up<br>so to see if you've actually progressed<br>and are achieving those goals you've got<br>to add in some evaluation<br>and that's where this gets tricky<br>because how do you measure if I've<br>portrayed warmth in my science<br>communication or if I've demonstrated<br>integrity<br>that's that's our evaluation actually is<br>a little bit hard and mysterious because<br>well I mean researchers have to do this<br>too you have to figure out ways to<br>measure things that will tell you<br>so<br>luckily Wesley and Judo have started<br>doing this for us they had created both<br>um<br>scales and survey questions for<br>measuring if people have perceived you<br>as warm and also their sort of Baseline<br>attitudes towards science in general<br>they've found that these four on the<br>left here competence listening integrity<br>and showing warmth were key to trust<br>overall so they've really encouraged in<br>like several Publications<br>to prioritize those things if you want<br>to be trustworthy in your audience<br>and they also have this nice one of<br>self-efficacy which<br>I know self-efficacy might seem a little<br>bit<br>silly or<br>I don't need to do that I don't need to<br>remind myself that I'm improving at<br>things but one thing that I've learned<br>coming into qualitative research because<br>I used to be a pretty quantitative<br>Fisheries ecologist and adapting to<br>qualitative research was quite the<br>ordeal I mean I'm still doing it I had<br>to write a whole Journal about my<br>feelings about how did I even pick this<br>PhD but eventually I've gotten to the<br>place where I realized like it really<br>does matter when you<br>when you consistently check in with<br>yourself about how you're improving and<br>changing in in<br>social science we'd call this<br>positionality towards others that you're<br>um working with or communicating to in<br>terms of power dynamics in terms of<br>trust in terms of relationships<br>um and also how you can improve<br>so don't I guess I'm saying don't knock<br>self-efficacy it's it's a good one too<br>and this this scale is really<br>like they've put it all there already<br>um<br>if you guys are interested in other<br>types of evaluation let's see how much<br>time do I have left<br>oh good<br>I'm wrapping it up just in time so I<br>didn't have time to put in every single<br>great evaluation instrument and rubric<br>and indicator that I could I really<br>prioritize those ones because I like<br>best landoodles they've they're pretty<br>much the only one that really<br>tied it to Theory really clearly but<br>there's all types of<br>surveys and interview guides and scales<br>and<br>um I've put the most helpful ones here<br>and I can send these to you later if you<br>um<br>yeah I guess I'll wrap up now my<br>takeaways are<br>evaluation is not that mysterious you<br>don't have to always think of it as some<br>person coming in and telling you how bad<br>you're doing it's actually something<br>that we all do all the time and you can<br>do yourself if you want to<br>um if you don't want to I also have a<br>little part at the end about how you can<br>hire an evaluator to see if you're<br>reaching your goals or work with a PhD<br>student<br>um<br>metrics are important vanity metrics are<br>not helpful in a lot of cases<br>and evaluation is part of this process<br>of thinking strategically to to make<br>sure that we're reaching our goals for<br>science communication because if we care<br>about it enough to put our free time<br>because I know we don't get much credit<br>for doing science communication to put<br>our free time into science communication<br>you want to make sure that you're<br>actually<br>causing some change with it right you<br>want to make sure you're doing something<br>with it so that's what evaluation can<br>help you do<br>I forgot to check the chat<br>cheese<br>oh thanks Aaron can you hear me I should<br>I guess I'll put a little reminder like<br>I would love it if you all could tell me<br>what seemed like the most helpful thing<br>what seemed like I didn't get that at<br>all or like take that out next time or<br>if if there's something you really<br>okay<br>let me just do the microphone<br>getting all these extra steps on today<br>guys<br>thanks that was wonderful<br>um my question is to deal with what if<br>you do science communication as a job so<br>you're not the researcher but you're in<br>that super awesome situation between the<br>researcher and between the public<br>where do you plug into this information<br>and what you've learned<br>yeah<br>I'm assuming that's what you do<br>um<br>yeah<br>um so here's the thing<br>in other countries evaluation is a lot<br>more important for that kind of role<br>because impact is a big deal and and is<br>required to be evaluated in the UK for<br>example<br>um here I think it's helpful<br>um MB does<br>oh does everybody know what I mean when<br>I say impact<br>actually that's that's a bad way to<br>phrase it let's just go talk about<br>impact for a second<br>impact is basically another way to say<br>long-term<br>changes<br>indicators like well-being and<br>environment<br>that result from your research<br>um<br>it's very hard to demonstrate that your<br>research<br>has a causal connection to lots of types<br>of impact therefore it requires special<br>types of evaluation that include that<br>causality<br>and I bring that up because MB for<br>example wants<br>all of its Endeavor funds to include<br>this line of sight to impact<br>so this is where<br>it could be really helpful to somebody<br>in a professional sense if you could say<br>I can make you a stellar line of sight<br>to impact because I know how to measure<br>these different phases and show that<br>you're having<br>the you're meeting the goals that you<br>want to meet<br>that's where I think it becomes<br>more important<br>that said I feel like everybody could<br>benefit from<br>learning a little bit by getting more<br>feedback from evaluation and and<br>thinking about what they do<br>as frequently as they can<br>I sit down after almost everything I do<br>every interview I have every talk I give<br>sometimes just interactions with people<br>in my<br>department and give myself a little<br>review give myself a little evaluation<br>of how I did and what I should do<br>differently next time<br>so<br>I hope that's helpful<br>yeah<br>so in addition to like a<br>an end of either event or something<br>evaluation<br>um is there value in also having<br>um<br>a during evaluation something that kind<br>of assesses the the progress of<br>something before you've reached that end<br>point<br>um where you would typically have<br>something at the beginning to say this<br>is the Baseline this is what it's at the<br>end and then kind of progress<br>yeah I've decided to take that slide out<br>so thank you for there<br>yeah<br>because this is a little bit too table<br>it's too much of a table for a slide so<br>I didn't really it wasn't quite there<br>yet but basically what this is trying to<br>show is that<br>um if you're still pretty early in the<br>science communication activity you're<br>doing if you're still developing<br>right now<br>right now you probably don't have<br>an option to say I'm going to evaluate<br>my impacts that are going to happen in<br>several years down the line what would<br>be really helpful is for you to figure<br>out some indicators that you are<br>making the correct activity for your<br>goal it's going to be able to be careful<br>that you're meeting the needs of the<br>community that you're trying to work<br>with and then as you start to implement<br>it that that you're actually able to<br>deliver on the plan that you've made<br>that's a type of evaluation called a<br>profit<br>so yeah there's there are many many<br>different types of evaluation and it's<br>meeting your<br>need where you are at the time and your<br>it kind of goes hand in hand with<br>program development<br>so that it can develop that Baseline for<br>you<br>um<br>oh gosh<br>foreign<br>so one of the things that I want to like<br>achieve with the podcast that I'm<br>working on the science book subscribe<br>now on Spotify and iTunes is we're<br>interviewing we're interviewing like<br>um scientists and we want to like not<br>only talk to them about their research<br>but why would like the part of the<br>reason to do it as like an interview<br>based thing<br>is to like<br>show The Wider public like the people<br>behind research which isn't like done in<br>a lot of places I don't think and it's<br>yeah kind of getting to what you're<br>alluding to before about like the<br>scientists are normal human people yeah<br>that sort of thing where do you think<br>that fits in like the kind of big like<br>goal slide you have and how would that<br>be something to like evaluate oh I think<br>that that's right and actually there's a<br>um I think that's probably part trust<br>and part identity and part career goals<br>um<br>but if you just want to see if you<br>like can Inspire your listeners to<br>um<br>think more broadly about what a<br>scientist looks like I mean there's a<br>whole initiative called This is what a<br>scientist looks like have you heard of<br>that one yeah yeah so there's literally<br>a scale for that to like measure if if a<br>before and after if they've changed if<br>they've started thinking more broadly<br>um<br>yeah great question I hope you do that<br>let's talk more yeah that would be cool<br>the thing the thing that I was like<br>hoping somebody would ask me and if<br>there's no more questions and there's<br>time maybe I'll just say it anyway and<br>it's time<br>okay<br>so another thing about social media is<br>you need to<br>get you kind of need to build a funnel<br>so that you can get access to your<br>audience at the level that they'll be<br>able to take the survey or to tell you<br>how their thoughts about scientists have<br>changed so um you know what I mean by a<br>funnel you have like a freebie on your<br>website and people give you their email<br>address<br>um<br>I'm still pretty new to University<br>ethics systems so I don't know if that<br>might need an Ethics approval or not<br>but if you are going to do that you<br>might want to look into it and see<br>yeah okay I'll wrap up now thanks<br>thank you so much yes that was amazing<br>thanks to um everyone being so<br>interactive as well um yeah and we're<br>going to go and have some lunch I think<br>down at the lake because it's a lovely<br>day and so if anyone would like to join<br>us you're very welcome to come along and<br>have more of a chat and if you have<br>feedback for just feel free to just send<br>it to me<br>um and I shall pass on<br>I would really really love your harshest<br>Christian<br>that's helpful to my research she's very<br>resilient</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
