Mana Moana reinforces connected genealogies of Māori and Pacific peoples across deep time and space beyond the shores of Aotearoa, New Zealand. <br><br>How do we better enable placemaking and cultural identity through the built environment? What can we do to enable the wellbeing of Indigenous communities of the present time? How does the profession of architecture respond to these cultural shifts across the Trans-Tasman?<br><br>The three lectures aim to provoke, educate and inspire our conversations about placemaking, cultural positioning and the transformational possibilities of architecture.<br>-<br>About the talk and speakers:<br>Professor Paul Memmott is an anthropologist and architect and for some decades has been the Director of the Aboriginal Environments Research Centre (AERC) at the University of Queensland (School of Architecture and Institute for Social Science Research). The AERC has provided an applied research focus on a range of topics in relation to Indigenous populations, including institutional architecture, vernacular architecture, housing, crowding, governance, well-being, homelessness, family violence and social planning for communities.<br><br>Professor Alison Page has a vision for the world where Aboriginal cultural stories give rise to everyday design projects. Working in architecture, interiors, jewellery and public art, Page champions the recognition of Aboriginal design as a perspective that honours the origin and intention of Aboriginal stories, and which adds value to design beyond aesthetics or pattern making.<br><br>These Australian-based cultural experts are leading ideas and systemic transformations in placemaking from the realms of Indigenous design and architecture, working Aboriginal communities. As a comparative lecture for us in Aotearoa, their talks will highlight the similarities and differences in how we approach placemaking and Indigenous design across the Trans-Tasman.<br>-<br>Follow

our<br>canoe<br>to our school beautiful gift so thank<br>you<br>I love the expressions of Professor<br>our other we had an Ava ceremony and<br>this is historical because we've never<br>really had this for our faculty so it's<br>awesome to do this with our<br>International guests and you can see<br>here two of our PhD students our newest<br>meaning thanks we also had Bray Brady<br>Haka who's also a PhD student of Lee's<br>from planning so very awesome<br>um<br>and we've got our kairahi here with kuki<br>kingi sharing his sacred Waka curricula<br>with us<br>this is<br>dot dot dot watch this space<br>so yeah<br>Anthony hoite<br>Lena Henry also was part of our mehi<br>and then Allison spoke at Ayla hoyta's<br>class<br>School of Design<br>a la hoyta is one of our newest Maori<br>lecturers and it was just awesome<br>awesome to hear Alison's work<br>this is their class<br>I feel like I need music with this<br>um awesome engagement with<br>Anthony hoite and also Jeremy Treadwell<br>Paul had a great time with them catching<br>research which is about earthquake<br>resilient fatty all around aotearoa so<br>this is awesome dot dot dot watch the<br>space<br>we did a bit of touring seeing our<br>campus buildings but also other sites<br>around Tamaki Makoto<br>so Alison and Paul um<br>joined in in llama's Studio which is<br>about Samoa a brief and Samoa<br>cross-cultural sustainability climate<br>change awesome and actually the next<br>night Paul became an expert in climate<br>change<br>and so<br>manafino of Tamaki Makoto it was awesome<br>to be hosted around<br>by our assistant Pro Vice Chancellor<br>Maori Michael Steadman<br>and again awesome connections for Alison<br>Ive are you his house it was great to<br>show you his<br>today this morning llama and poor<br>presented their research to the class<br>and Paul spoke about<br>um<br>kinship groupings about social spatial<br>behaviors within camps but also<br>Australia as the country it is many<br>countries and so again fantastic<br>and yeah this is just showing more<br>so their time with us Ends Tonight with<br>their public lectures for the fast<br>forward 2023. tonight we continue the<br>theme of Mana Moana<br>which acknowledges The ancestral<br>connections across this Great Pacific<br>Ocean<br>that connects us all<br>we continue with the ideas about<br>indigenizing places<br>indigenizing design thinking and going<br>deep into time and space<br>to understand lines of connection lines<br>of remembering lines of knowing country<br>so we thank you all for joining us this<br>evening<br>I like to pass it on to our professor<br>libiti head of school of te Paris School<br>thank you very much and awesome<br>introduction lava and Charmaine so I<br>just like to give them a round of<br>applause for all the work with those<br>running that sort of stuff and all the<br>people that have helped them so I'm not<br>going to take too long I just wanted to<br>say<br>it's and just where you sort of ended up<br>was a really good point about where our<br>place is in the Pacific and where we see<br>ourselves here at the school<br>and I just wanted to acknowledge it to<br>someone one of our members has just left<br>the school after 24 years and it just<br>showed where we sit as a school being<br>106 years of being a school and<br>hopefully will be a school for a lot<br>longer than that but that person was<br>here Russell was here for a quarter of<br>our whole life of the school which I<br>think is an incredible thing and I think<br>as Urban designers Urban plans and<br>Architects that's what we're thinking<br>about the Long View and what you're<br>talking about<br>so bringing it back to what we're<br>talking about tonight which is really<br>really important it's recovering for<br>covert as I said the last time I was had<br>the privilege to kick off one of these<br>lectures again is about bringing us back<br>face to face bring us back to who we are<br>bringing us back to what we are as a<br>school and bringing back our<br>International guests which we were the<br>first ones we've managed to bring back<br>since covert which is great to have our<br>colleagues and lovely friends from<br>across the ditch it's always good to<br>have those types of people yeah<br>so it's really great to have you here<br>really reinforce our place in the<br>Pacific great to have our friends from<br>us across the ditch in Sydney who do<br>start this process again about<br>re-engaging with the world and it's<br>really important for us to do as a<br>school<br>but now I have to do the most important<br>thing in many ways and let's introduce<br>our sponsor because without jib without<br>Gordon and his team we wouldn't be able<br>to do any of this so without further Ado<br>I'd like to pass out to our lovely<br>sponsor just for all the support<br>foreign<br>my positiveness<br>um I'll keep this very very brief I<br>should put my cards on the table my name<br>is Gordon I'm from Winston War boards<br>and I do the marketing so if you let me<br>keep talking I'll just keep going so<br>you've been warned but um on behalf of<br>windstones and Jeb you know firstly I'd<br>just like to say thank you for the<br>opportunity to be here tonight<br>um purely from a selfish point of view<br>I've learned a lot from these sort of<br>events of what's coming through and and<br>being able to learn from you know such<br>privileged people and distinguish people<br>as yourselves you know we really take a<br>lot from it so thank you for taking the<br>time to be with us tonight and thank you<br>all for allowing us to be here tonight<br>um that's pretty much all I'm going to<br>say we do have a little short video on<br>the new manufacturing plant from<br>Tauranga which we always get a lot of<br>questions on so I'll step out of the way<br>and let that go and if there's any<br>questions uh just yell out<br>in 2023 Windstone wall boards will open<br>its new jib plasterboard manufacturing<br>and distribution facility in todiko<br>Tauranga Tauranga is New Zealand's fifth<br>largest city and is the fastest growing<br>Regional economy<br>New Zealand's fastest growing Regional<br>job market and home to the largest most<br>efficient port in the country<br>the new Windstone wallboards plant will<br>be based at the toadiko business park 10<br>kilometers from Tauranga City it will be<br>built on 12.8 hectares of land making it<br>2.5 times bigger than the current site<br>designed with sustainability at the<br>Forefront this plant will be a<br>significant step forward towards<br>Fletcher building's goal of reducing<br>carbon emissions by 2030 the new plant<br>will have extensive recycling capability<br>on site for water and waste it will also<br>include new state-of-the-art technology<br>and Equipment enabling the business to<br>manufacture the full range of our gym<br>plasterboard products with a high degree<br>of flexibility automated processors will<br>also ensure increased enhancement of the<br>safety and Manufacturing processes<br>the new Windstone War boards facility<br>reinforces our commitment to<br>Manufacturing in New Zealand and we look<br>thank you sponsor thank you<br>all right so now it gives me a very<br>great honor to introduce<br>my mentor<br>kalmatua and friend Professor Paul mimet<br>Professor Paul meme is an anthropologist<br>architect and for some decades has been<br>the director of the Aboriginal<br>environments Research Center aerc at the<br>University of Queensland<br>in recent years Paul has directed the<br>indigenous design place<br>an initiative which draws on<br>interdisciplinary researchers across the<br>University's faculties and engages with<br>indigenous clients and personnel<br>poor scholarship includes over 300<br>Publications including 11 books and<br>monographs<br>and I would say the most significant<br>would be goodly the Aboriginal<br>architecture of Australia<br>and a lot alongside that with Professor<br>Allison page they co-wrote design<br>building on country<br>amazing books<br>in addition<br>215 applied research reports and 40<br>competitive grants<br>he has supervised over 50 postgraduate<br>and honors students and he has won<br>several prestigious teaching awards for<br>indigenous education<br>now to name a few of Paul's previous<br>students because some of you may know<br>them<br>Dr Timo Rook<br>also one of my co-supervisors<br>the late associate professor Elizabeth<br>Grant<br>Kevin O'Brien<br>the Aboriginal architect from Queensland<br>Dr shaneen Fenton from people oriented<br>design<br>Dr James Davidson<br>who's very much a an expert in climate<br>resilience in Queensland<br>Dr Stephen long and the list goes on<br>and so really this is to demonstrate the<br>Excellence in teaching and excellence in<br>pushing forward research about<br>indigenous communities in Australia and<br>through myself in the Pacific and so I'm<br>one of the lucky students who had the<br>privilege of completing a PhD with um<br>Professor Paul mimet from 2012 to 2016.<br>and Paul I just want to say I grew so<br>much as a researcher as a writer as an<br>independent thinker and for that I'm<br>forever grateful<br>I'm also grateful to Professor DJ Brown<br>who introduced us back in my masters so<br>so in 2021 Paul was awarded the officer<br>of the order of Australia AO for<br>distinguished services to ethno<br>architecture anthropology to indigenous<br>housing and cultural heritage and to<br>tertiary education including co-founding<br>the Aboriginal data archive in 1976.<br>Paul it's my great pleasure to host you<br>here in aotearoa waipapato motor<br>in a small way this is to reciprocate<br>your aroha your<br>your support<br>ongoing mentorship<br>and all those opportunities you created<br>yeah<br>foreign<br>if you're not a big fan of lollies Paul<br>I'll be glad to take that off your hands<br>joining him tonight is Professor Alison<br>Page<br>who is a world Banger and wadiwadi woman<br>from thorough wool and Ewan apologies if<br>I'm mispronouncing these nations<br>and is an award a winning designer<br>artist and filmmaker who has been<br>practicing<br>since the late 90s<br>connecting First Nations stories and<br>traditional knowledges to contemporary<br>art<br>architecture Urban Design public art and<br>film<br>she appeared for eight years as a<br>regular panelist on the ABC TV show the<br>new inventors in 2015 was inducted into<br>the design Institute of Australia's Hall<br>of Fame and last year won the interior<br>design excellence awards gold medal she<br>is associate Dean at the University of<br>Technology's design architecture and<br>building school and the founder of the<br>national Aboriginal design agency<br>together they have written a<br>best-selling book<br>design building country as mentioned<br>which explores indigenous design<br>architecture and engineering principles<br>as a blueprint for contemporary<br>Australian design and architecture and<br>what and that is what they are here to<br>share with us tonight<br>darling<br>thanks now make sure you go and sit up<br>there<br>foreign<br>it's a place of replenishment and<br>knowledge and power the Aboriginal<br>connection to country is an intimate<br>relationship built over tens of<br>thousands of years that has permeated<br>this land the vibrations of countless<br>dreams and stories<br>there is and never has been any real sex<br>between people animals plants earth<br>water or air<br>the trees the rivers mountains the sky<br>even the things we make and build it is<br>all part of country<br>and country is like a family member our<br>cousins aunties our brothers and sisters<br>country is where we all come from<br>we all breathe this country<br>and this country breathes us<br>I'm a filmmaker so I couldn't help<br>thank you<br>the country where we talk tonight<br>we'd like to acknowledge the elders from<br>this country past present and future<br>we acknowledge for<br>putting on this event tonight<br>and we<br>thank in honor the people who brought us<br>here<br>and they've shown us<br>somewhere we can maybe<br>I'm going to start talking first<br>and um<br>bear with bear with us because I'm not<br>going to talk immediately about<br>architecture<br>Allison will take that up in a little<br>while<br>uh<br>I also have to acknowledge all of the<br>old people who taught me and who've<br>passed away<br>some of them were in that image you saw<br>which brought tears to my eye<br>um<br>since 2007 I've been privileged to be<br>teaching in a an Aboriginal controlled<br>Aboriginal owned<br>pre-vocational training school in<br>Western Queensland on the Georgina River<br>basin what I'm known as Kamara<br>and<br>there are certain lessons I I teach<br>there to Young Aboriginal people<br>I'm in charge of teaching the culture<br>there<br>and the first thing the boss says is<br>what you're probably all wondering why<br>there's a white fella teaching your<br>culture and uh<br>he says because the old people taught<br>him and the old people have all passed<br>away and it's his job to give the<br>culture back to us Aboriginal people<br>and so I've probably I've taught like<br>there about for um<br>uh<br>17 years<br>three three intakes a year of up to 30<br>people<br>and there are certain things I'm<br>privilege to teach there that I don't<br>normally put out but I've asked the<br>leader of the group Colin salt me a<br>Buller<br>for permission to do some talking from<br>my<br>lessons here tonight so I'm going to<br>start with an account of the dreaming<br>the dream time<br>and that's going to lay the foundation<br>for what Allison's going to follow on<br>with and we'll both be joining in on<br>that a little bit<br>so um and I'm going to ask llama to help<br>me<br>so<br>in the beginning<br>when the land was soft<br>and plastic<br>and they jumped up<br>at<br>they sat and stood<br>and this was the beginning of the dream<br>so we start with dream time in the past<br>and we'll I'll move on to talking about<br>it in the present or in the What's<br>called the Ever when with all the time<br>dimensions folded into one<br>some of them just stayed at their sites<br>others traveled out a little bit<br>came back to their site<br>and still others<br>went for long travels making more sites<br>so in the belief system we have to<br>imagine that the whole of<br>the whole of the continent is covered<br>by these travel travel routes and sites<br>The ancestral beings<br>Left Behind energies in these sites<br>and their energies are believed to be<br>Perpetual Energies<br>defying the Western laws of physics of<br>course<br>um<br>so<br>they had<br>Adventures at these sites<br>they might have been minor Little<br>Adventures sometimes they met another<br>another creature from the dream time<br>and had an encounter they might have had<br>a fight they might have exchanged things<br>they might have talked they might have<br>made love<br>one of them might have got injured or<br>killed<br>they also left parts of their bodies<br>behind as they traveled<br>perhaps ribs<br>or hair or body fluids<br>blood<br>semen<br>and they also left behind a name for<br>each place they made<br>and they invariably made a song up for<br>each site that they left behind<br>and in that song they encoded various<br>things they encoded usually something<br>they also may have left behind a sacred<br>object what<br>pakawa called<br>um<br>a turinga stone<br>and<br>so it's difficult for people to<br>understand now that the whole continent<br>is covered with these sites containing<br>Perpetual energies even under the<br>bitumen or the concrete of the Cities<br>the belief system tells us that these<br>sites are still there<br>this is Alison's also showing her map of<br>um Sydney that she will talk about in<br>due course and developing<br>the her sort of interpretation of this<br>um<br>at a certain time in the ancient past<br>because<br>I should have said but each of these<br>ancestral beings<br>was a part was part it had human<br>qualities but it also had either part<br>animal or part plant or part<br>meteorological or part planetary so we<br>have we have kangaroo men<br>and we have emu women and we have yam<br>women and we had python men<br>uh we had some some people Moon people<br>Ryan people this is a raindreaming on my<br>shirt<br>um<br>and at this point in the past there was<br>a division where humans were born out of<br>these places<br>and those humans kept something of the<br>of the animal or plant in them<br>and the Animals also and plants and<br>stars and things were born out of these<br>places and they sep they kept something<br>of the human qualities in them<br>and so today we find that there are<br>descendants of these places and they<br>tend to be in clustered these sites so<br>that we have<br>another<br>we have these clusters of sites which<br>belong to particular dreamings or as<br>anthropologists call them totems<br>so each one will be associated with a<br>particular plant or animal<br>or star or might be the Seven Sisters or<br>the Southern Cross<br>and these are what anthropologists call<br>Estates<br>and within each one is a descent group<br>from the from the particular ancestral<br>being in this area<br>what's called what the anthropologists<br>will call a clan or<br>and those people are said to be<br>descended from the dreaming<br>and so the whole continent was made up<br>of these<br>Estates<br>and the ceremonies that were left behind<br>they were their responsibility was to<br>perpetuate the ceremonies and songs for<br>each of their countries<br>and the people here of the kangaroo<br>dreaming for example their job was to<br>perform the kangaroo ceremonies and<br>these were the type that anthropologists<br>call increased rituals or fertility<br>rituals<br>and so also I I think I didn't mention<br>that out of during the dream time out of<br>the ground sprung designs on the ground<br>and then sprung up onto the beings<br>sprung up onto their Shields and so<br>these humans today their their<br>responsibility is to create these sacred<br>designs on the ground and reenact the<br>ritual in the exact way that the<br>ancestors left it<br>all of these groups then were charged<br>with<br>doing their ceremonies so that<br>there was a balance in nature<br>if the emus weren't weren't abundant in<br>a particular year the Emu people would<br>be blamed for not doing their ceremonies<br>and so on the yam people would the yam<br>women would have to do their ceremonies<br>the rain people would have to do their<br>and it was no good<br>these kangaroo men couldn't certainly<br>couldn't go and do an emu ceremony<br>because they did not have the emus<br>energy in them from the site from the<br>Diana De lungua the memberi the word<br>these are the words for these energies<br>in the sites in different languages<br>so this is the next this is the<br>explanation as to why there weren't any<br>Adolf Hitler's or um<br>Roman emperors or uh<br>Genghis khans taking over country and<br>taking people's country<br>Authority was decentralized in these<br>Cults in these Titanic totemic lodges<br>because only their their ceremonies work<br>um<br>and hence there's no no oral history of<br>any great Wars of any great conquests in<br>Aboriginal Australia over 60 000 years<br>um<br>the exception was that if there was a<br>traveling dreaming just say for example<br>this was a raindreaming the rain people<br>here<br>and and this and there was another rain<br>dreaming in this country and there was a<br>linking travel route these rain people<br>could join in with their ceremonies<br>although this group would lead them<br>and so on<br>so some of these travel lines went long<br>distances across the continent and<br>that's what's Bruce Chapman introduced<br>this term the song lines<br>um<br>I think I've laid enough Concepts now to<br>give Alison a foot up but I've got to<br>just do one more thing and um<br>I'm going to read<br>read and excerpt<br>to give you a sense of what these songs<br>were like I'm going to read a<br>translation of a series of songs<br>from the southern Gulf of Carpenteria<br>and um<br>it's about a tiger shark<br>and one has to put oneself in the<br>position of the singers the singers are<br>all of the tiger shark dreaming<br>and by singing the songs they're singing<br>in the present tense but they're<br>repeating the Journey of the shark in<br>the present as if they are reenacting it<br>as being real for the now<br>the shock and the singers become<br>embodied together there one<br>and the shark sections are once more<br>brought into being by the cult members<br>and<br>so when I when I read this you have to<br>imagine it's men who are chanting songs<br>over and over<br>the eye The Well of the tiger shark is<br>there at manangura<br>manengura it is there that the tiger<br>shark climbed up singing the shark was<br>at the well singing he was sending his<br>song Back to the country where he had<br>traveled<br>my father's name<br>the tiger shark was at the well singing<br>and so it is we are singing the well<br>Manji and the trees that surround it<br>and then we are singing the double<br>barred finches and the bar-shouldered<br>doves that come to drink at the well<br>onwards then we are carrying the song<br>and we are singing the very tall cycad<br>Palms<br>which have as their personal name<br>yolunguri that same name as the shark<br>and then we are singing the white barked<br>gum tree which is named in the song<br>asgarajiji the same name as my father's<br>brother<br>and we are singing northwards and we<br>descend down down into the depths of the<br>river and we are singing the mouth of<br>the shark down in the depths of the<br>river we are singing Here We Sing The<br>bundle of soaking cycad nuts and we<br>follow the high tide when the current is<br>Flowing strongly Downstream<br>we continue singing northwards and then<br>we are climbing up onto the riverbank<br>onwards now onwards along the riverbank<br>we are singing and we're singing The<br>Tall steep sides of the Eastern river<br>bank<br>it is the mainland yes we are still<br>singing on the mainland we are seeing<br>the camps for the old people and we are<br>seeing the children who will not stop<br>talking we sing the bark canoes and the<br>old man making the fishing net the psych<br>had bread and the footpaths along the<br>top of the riverbank and then onwards<br>onwards onwards and northwards we follow<br>the path of this song in its fullness<br>and completeness we are singing it we<br>are singing it<br>and so you get the sense of the Poetry<br>of the songs even though that's very<br>compressed<br>so that's how you do site analysis in<br>Aboriginal architecture in Australia<br>it all starts with story and it all<br>starts with song lines and it all starts<br>with those Energies<br>and I think what you beautifully<br>explained Paul was our law<br>and how our law was recorded and how all<br>of our science was recorded<br>um<br>was through these ancestral tracks that<br>were laid down by<br>um these ancestral beings thousands of<br>years ago and as you pass through<br>ceremony and law so Aboriginal people<br>didn't write anything down<br>so the way that we remembered all of the<br>cultural and ecological and scientific<br>data that you need to survive like the<br>average person would need to know<br>everything there is to know about 400<br>plants you know when they flower you<br>know that story there about the cycad<br>and how how you would prepare you know<br>leech the poisons out of the nuts you<br>know because how you said that you know<br>the<br>um in the Chant there is that uh<br>reference to the bag in the bottom at<br>the high tide in the bottom of uh where<br>the uh<br>is that all I could have also talked<br>about the shark then traveled and he had<br>his stomach was full of these cycad nuts<br>and he was vomiting out the nuts as he<br>traveled along the coast for a thousand<br>kilometers and these nuts then grew into<br>Groves of cycat trees which are sacred<br>sites and he left behind that technology<br>for people to use for humans to use and<br>so we like many other cultures in the<br>world I think the Turkish have memory<br>palaces Aboriginal people encoded all of<br>that data all of that knowledge into<br>stories the more elaborate the stories<br>obviously the vomiting you know there's<br>you know a bit of sex and you know great<br>stories have elaborate chapters that can<br>be remembered<br>um<br>each one of those quite often some of<br>the characters will be plants or they'll<br>turn into animals or they'll<br>um yeah like go back to some of the<br>ancestral stories of being part plant<br>part animal part human<br>and encoded in it like as you get older<br>and you pass through ceremony and law<br>the key to the code is unlocked to you<br>and so how you remember all of that data<br>is by walking country because those<br>stories are embedded into Geographic<br>locations and into objects and into song<br>and into dance and into the paintings<br>that are on the cave walls in the<br>paintings in the sand in the paintings<br>on the body so you are using multi-art<br>form and actually design really to kind<br>of continually reinforce the mnemonic<br>continually reinforcing not only that<br>ecological and environmental data but<br>also social mores you know in that story<br>I love the reference to you know the<br>kids who won't shut up there'll be<br>something in there that's also layering<br>about how to how to maintain Healthy<br>Communities yeah so this is going to<br>understanding the cultural landscape<br>and when I was with lamu's students the<br>other day I was asking them well what's<br>happening in the landscape around the<br>building they had didn't they had little<br>sense of anything<br>and today with llama students we talked<br>about the cultural landscape around<br>Auckland and the importance of<br>particular sites and mountains and<br>islands and the canoe portal that Riri<br>taught me about it and understanding<br>that the sacred sites are only one of<br>about 20<br>categories of types of sites that are in<br>the Aboriginal geography and present in<br>the cultural landscape so Allison's<br>talking about unpacking all of that<br>in the interpretation of design and the<br>positioning of a building or a landscape<br>in a project<br>because this these song lines are still<br>very much a fabric of the part of<br>Australia that's something that<br>the colonizers couldn't destroy it's<br>still very much there so in a way it's<br>really interesting<br>um<br>sort of brief I suppose to the to the<br>designers of geographic location and the<br>designers of things that what is your<br>role in preserving and amplifying<br>the song lines that are part of the<br>fabric of Australia the part of place<br>and so<br>you see these lines they're also<br>calendars so some of the stories like<br>there's another shark dreaming story<br>from the Torres Strait that will tell<br>you when a particular constellation is<br>on the horizon that means that this<br>particular shark is breeding and you can<br>see the oil<br>um on on top of the water but that will<br>also tell you that the yam is ready to<br>eat<br>and so over a period of 65 000 years as<br>the climate changed and of course there<br>was the ice age in that time this web<br>would have been this kind of moving uh<br>system of of remembering and so the<br>stories would have had to have changed<br>and adapt you know and of course also<br>stories would have also had major events<br>like some of our dreaming stories were<br>starting to learn now are actually<br>eyewitness accounts of major floods<br>volcanic eruptions so there's some<br>really interesting research going on in<br>Australia around that yeah I talked to<br>this week about deep time and deep<br>history and the fact that in Australia<br>now we have transdisciplinary<br>researchers who are going back<br>in time to try and understand how<br>Aboriginal people adapted to these<br>climate change events in the past<br>to help with what to do now in the and<br>in the future so there are there are<br>secrets that can be unlocked through the<br>oral histories combined with the<br>archeology the Linguistics the<br>geomorphology and so on and that's why<br>when even in Sydney this is my<br>traditional land so I'm my ancestors<br>were camping at the opera house where<br>the opera house is<br>um<br>in 1788 when the First Fleet arrived but<br>at you know they have stories about this<br>Valley it was a beautiful when the sea<br>was 50 kilometers further east it was a<br>beautiful Valley with rivers running<br>through it and so some of those islands<br>you can see would have been mountains<br>and so some of those song lines exist<br>still in the sea and in Autumn land<br>you'll still have fishermen who won't<br>cross particular parts of the water<br>because they still remember the<br>boundaries that were there before<br>um<br>so it's interesting now when we we start<br>to do site analysis you know we've got<br>there's this Aboriginal architect Craig<br>cursed Lake and he's almost going out to<br>NASA level sort of space when he's doing<br>a site analysis right down to the to<br>this tiny little site in the middle of<br>Sydney but why that's important is<br>because<br>how you all of the decisions that you<br>make about how you might arrange a<br>building where you might put a window<br>where you might position people as they<br>walk through the space will have<br>everything to do with the soul lines<br>everything to do with that sacred<br>Mountain that is a hundred kilometers<br>away even though you can't see it we<br>still have to face it we still have to<br>honor it and and<br>make reference to it so that we're<br>continuing this system of Silence this<br>is the equivalent of the VAR in<br>Aboriginal Australia<br>there are the energies pervade out from<br>the sites from the sacred sites<br>and so um<br>yeah if you're if you're in<br>developing a an area with a new building<br>or a landscape there's a need to sense<br>and be aware of what is in that vicinity<br>and how it's impacting and how you<br>position and arrange in space and<br>activate space in a meaningful way<br>and Paul talked about these Perpetual<br>energies and how they the ancestral<br>energies ended up in plants or the our<br>ancestors Left Behind body parts and<br>they might become trees<br>will they become materials that end up<br>in objects and so in our philosophy<br>this is an image of a man Frank Roman<br>It's A Beautiful film if you ever go to<br>Australia and you go to the national<br>museum of Australia there's this<br>beautiful film of this man making this<br>fish trap and he holds the he must have<br>the responsibility of that particular<br>fish trap answer the fish trap ancestor<br>and so when he's making the the fish net<br>and the trap he's talking to the object<br>like it is a person<br>so we have dialogue as we are walking<br>around country like it is a family<br>member it is a living entity so this<br>this idea it was interesting you said<br>before it defies the laws of<br>um physics actually<br>um a lot of Aboriginal philosophies are<br>actually have a lot more in common with<br>quantum physics because we think there<br>is energy in everything even the rock<br>you know or the all the objects that we<br>make and build have energies I think<br>particle physics<br>so anyway that's another lecture which<br>we're not going to do<br>but he's talking to the fish trap<br>ancestor and he's saying you made this<br>water hole over here and in that water<br>hole I can get this type of fish at this<br>time of year and so the making of the<br>object the designing of the object and<br>the making of the object is ceremonial<br>so the artist or the maker or the<br>Builder is simply a medium through which<br>the ancestors are channeling themselves<br>through and so it's more than<br>remembering<br>like remembering obviously is very very<br>important but the object itself becomes<br>energized it becomes animated by country<br>and by these Perpetual energies and so I<br>think as designers that's a very<br>interesting concept for us to think<br>about it's a very interesting Concept in<br>in relation to this kind of throwaway<br>Society we have around objects that<br>um you know I think you've got sort of<br>Ikea at one end of the scale and you've<br>got you know this sort of idea of<br>building preciousness into in into<br>objects<br>yes and I I should have mentioned that<br>the descendants of a particular area are<br>kin close kin not only with the<br>dreamings but with that country and the<br>objects that come from that country<br>so people will call I will be driving in<br>along with old men and somebody will say<br>brother brother and he'll be talking to<br>a kangaroo going past<br>go peacefully brother we we are not here<br>to harm you we are here to protect you<br>and um<br>similarly with the country people talk<br>to the country all the time<br>Paul gave the best lecture today on<br>kinship and Country and skin and it's a<br>whole mathematical<br>um another<br>mind-blowing system we haven't got time<br>to get into now but it<br>um I think the takeaway really is the<br>idea that you can't separate any part of<br>nature<br>you can't separate if you are designing<br>for country and designing with country<br>you can't separate our ontology our<br>religious our beliefs and our<br>spirituality that somehow even in the<br>middle of a hectic City like Sydney and<br>you know I I thought Sydney had the most<br>building projects going on at the moment<br>but then I came to Auckland<br>I know I realized wow it's really hard<br>to tune in to the ancestral beings here<br>right now but you know somehow we have<br>to as practitioners kind of find a way<br>to<br>to bring some of these Concepts to life<br>and we're talking here about identity so<br>understanding the identity of country<br>the identity of the totems The<br>Descendants share that identity<br>how do we bring identity into projects<br>and materials that we're using<br>this is an image from ganya Gundy and<br>Worley<br>uh<br>and we're not going to go into it<br>Aboriginal architecture tonight but it's<br>all in that book<br>but we just put it up because it it<br>brings out this issue of positioning<br>buildings on Country how do we do it<br>and also that you know<br>our nura our<br>only words actually that is the same in<br>all of the Australian average languages<br>it means home and so our concept of home<br>is this broader<br>um area so actually we didn't place that<br>much kind of emphasis<br>um on you know the shelters that we kind<br>of lived in they were more like a second<br>skin they were lightweight they were<br>made of readily made of materials they<br>were extremely<br>um sustainable and very good for the<br>climate designed for the climate<br>um you know as it adapted as well and<br>could be moved which you know there I<br>don't know what it's like here but there<br>are certainly towns in Australia that<br>are being so inundated by floods at the<br>moment that you know this concept isn't<br>country is home<br>country is home so it's a very<br>interesting idea that I think you know<br>part of the existential crisis I think<br>Australia is having around housing is<br>that in this obsession with housing and<br>I know New Zealand is equally obsessed<br>with real estate as we are<br>but the one of the core issues there is<br>that people see home ownership as their<br>only way of belonging<br>and so what we have to do and part of<br>the cultural inheritance of First<br>Nations people to all people who come<br>and live on their country is to find out<br>the stories of that land and find new<br>ways to belong there find ceremony find<br>language find song find other ways to<br>belong otherwise we are all gonna die<br>becoming sort of like not a nice to have<br>but a must-have<br>because this<br>isn't good<br>you know this bringing kind of um<br>these transplanted architectural styles<br>from England<br>and America and as Robin Boyd called it<br>you know in the 1960s he wrote the<br>Australian ugliness and said you know<br>Australia has to stop being secondhand<br>England or secondhand America you know<br>we have to find our own identity and the<br>identity has to grow from place because<br>this<br>is<br>not only embodying<br>Western values but it's just not good<br>for the climate in any way shape or form<br>and neither are the Landscapes that come<br>along with them<br>so when we in Australia at the moment<br>we're re-looking at Place making so in<br>New South Wales one of the colleagues<br>that I started working with and we were<br>all mentored by Paul<br>um so Dylan compa Mary<br>was Australia's first Aboriginal<br>architect<br>um<br>he has been working in the government<br>architect's office where we all started<br>our careers in the 90s he stayed there<br>and he's actually<br>convinced the state government to pass a<br>planning law that for any state<br>significant projects the developers and<br>the landowners have to demonstrate how<br>they are connecting with country how<br>they are co-designing with the<br>traditional owners<br>how they are looking after the land the<br>Sea and the sky as if it is a family<br>member<br>and they have to demonstrate how they<br>are enhancing the story of country and<br>inviting the traditional owners to<br>curate the entire city like it is a<br>museum because the landscape is our<br>Museum right so we need to curate each<br>site in the same way that it was curated<br>thousands of years ago this story should<br>be told here this story should be told<br>there<br>and following from that at least three<br>universities have now uh published their<br>strategic planning for country for<br>building on Country which follow the<br>same way but even that's just the<br>Vanguard of the tsunami of change that's<br>been happening<br>Allison and I are on a thing called The<br>First Nations advisory committee to the<br>Australian Institute of Architects<br>it's predominantly Aboriginal Architects<br>and designers this is one or two white<br>people who have been privileged to join<br>it which is myself as co-chair<br>and one of our first jobs was to advise<br>the The Architects accreditation Council<br>of Australia about six new competencies<br>required for architects around building<br>on country and engaging with communities<br>local communities<br>and those six new competencies have been<br>accepted by all Boards of Architects in<br>Australia and have be will be now part<br>of the board exam to become a registered<br>architect and in turn those requirements<br>are filtering now into the school<br>curriculum because to get accreditation<br>for as a school curricula you have you<br>have to be able to show that you're<br>teaching the material that's required<br>for the board exam<br>so this is causing an amazing tsunami of<br>change in Australia and all of the<br>architectural firms are suddenly ringing<br>the poor 15 or so members of our<br>committee saying what are we going to do<br>what are we going to do when we're very<br>busy producing new Acumen professional<br>practice notes and and trying to set up<br>fast learning curves for these firms<br>to engage in with local communities and<br>and Carry Out co-design processes with<br>them<br>in their new projects particularly<br>Public Public Works<br>so you know it's a little bit like when<br>the sustainability laws came in and the<br>industry itself and then actually<br>just started scrambling<br>experts in to kind of help each of these<br>firms the black design movement is in<br>the same space at the moment and so<br>where we have a bit of a problem in the<br>sense that we don't have enough<br>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br>practitioners<br>um we uh kind of<br>bringing together I mean now in<br>architectural teams you'll have Marine<br>scientists you'll have fire management<br>experts I mean this is interesting<br>because the imperative funnily enough<br>for this to be passed by the landowners<br>by the government<br>um and for developers to sign up to it<br>as well well they have to they want to<br>get the planning across the line and the<br>architecture firms have to do it<br>otherwise they're not going to win the<br>competition<br>so it's not law but it's kind of a<br>movement in the sense that you know it<br>has to be done but the impaire it's come<br>from major fires and major floods that<br>are happening like it's serious and so<br>you know I think the cost of not doing<br>it is starting to Dawn on these<br>landowners and so these relationships<br>between the landowners and the<br>traditional owners is kind of to invite<br>people to culturally govern these places<br>again as they were for 65 000 years is<br>refreshing<br>do we have to have a break soon hey<br>five minutes okay yeah so I'm just going<br>to show just a few projects I mean we do<br>there are Aboriginal architecture<br>projects going on around the country I<br>won't go into them because each<br>architect has their own approach this<br>was a building an extension of a wokenia<br>hospital and what was good about it was<br>the community you know<br>became the project managers they<br>actually made an incorporated entity<br>they built the hospital out of<br>stabilized Earth bricks so they started<br>to social Enterprise They employed I<br>think 10 Aboriginal Builders as part of<br>the project you know there was there was<br>more than just bricks and mortar<br>delivered but also it was embedded with<br>all of the cultural stories about their<br>um their totem the river the river Cod<br>um in my land back to my land<br>um you know at what a lot of what I do<br>on day one of a project is go back to<br>Old maps and try and find what country<br>was like before somebody came along and<br>blew it up<br>um what happened here at barangaroo was<br>the shipping industry just came and blew<br>up one of the best headlines it was the<br>highest point of the harbor and the Deep<br>right next to the deepest part of the<br>harbor so it's best fishing<br>and this was a place that we now call<br>barangaroo but part of that was about<br>reinstating the original Shoreline<br>um uh you know building artificial reefs<br>so that you can bring their marine life<br>back planting the endemic species doing<br>all sorts of ceremony and art projects<br>to kind of bring at least some of the<br>life back to this site and we call it<br>Rheumatic<br>rematurating country because like when<br>we repatriate objects we're bringing<br>this culture back to the people<br>I mean and it's it takes an act of will<br>because obviously it's huge amounts of<br>money so without without that law<br>without that regulation<br>um uh the planning guide we wouldn't be<br>able to kind of Boss these big<br>developers to do this work I'm working<br>at the moment in on a development called<br>um The Bays West Redevelopment it's on<br>Sydney Harbor as well<br>Paul talked about increased sites this<br>site was an old Coal Power Station<br>and we realized very quickly in this<br>working part of the it was a working<br>Port that there was an endangered white<br>seahorse there's literally only like a<br>small number of them left and so we<br>thought how do we create a contemporary<br>increased site in the in the context of<br>a large development where there's a new<br>Railway line and there's a new school<br>and there's multiple apartment buildings<br>there's going to be a large-scale<br>cultural<br>institution on the site and so you know<br>when we're in these meetings you know<br>there must be 40 or 50 Consultants but<br>they're all working to save the white<br>seahorse so what we're going to do is<br>with the Landscape Architects is<br>throughout the public space we are<br>building these channels where the high<br>tide of the harbor can actually wash<br>through these channels and be cleaned by<br>salt marsh<br>so at least 12 hours every day the site<br>sort of just breathes in and out this<br>salt water<br>there we found an old Creek that was<br>um incarcerated in a drain so we're<br>releasing the fresh water there and<br>doing what we can to clean the fresh<br>water<br>and then we're building these<br>um<br>you know we found out that their<br>favorite habitat we were working with<br>Marine scientists it's just the favorite<br>habitat of these seed horses was<br>abandoned shopping trolleys that people<br>had thrown in Sydney Harbor<br>and so we're getting artists inviting<br>artists to come and make motels that<br>will pin to the wall of the<br>um of the harbor in order to create you<br>know happy places for them to breed and<br>then we'll do and this is the most<br>important part we'll bring in the<br>creatives and the people with the<br>activation budgets to come along and do<br>seahorse ceremonies<br>so that becomes the identity of that<br>place<br>it's nothing like<br>how potent and spiritually potent this<br>was but at least it's in the terms of a<br>contemporary context with all of the<br>pressures of planning and Heritage and<br>everything else that we have to kind of<br>fight<br>um you know this is how we're trying to<br>reinstate this this cultural landscape<br>in the city<br>um just some of the things that we're<br>also looking at is is truth-telling<br>because there was you know stuff<br>happened this is the site where Captain<br>Cook landed and this was where my people<br>met Captain Cook my people thought that<br>he was a<br>um Reincarnation of their dead their<br>totem which had died and that was the<br>whale and so I made a sculpture that was<br>both the ribs of the whale and the bones<br>of the ship<br>because in Australia you know history is<br>got two perspectives it's a shared<br>history and there's two different ways<br>of looking at all of these monuments and<br>so a lot we're playing around a lot with<br>those um Bronze Statues and then<br>building this ceremony<br>so I can't go into this because we don't<br>have time but one of the projects I'm<br>working on in in the middle of the city<br>is about<br>um<br>uh looking at all the landscaping around<br>those original colonial buildings that<br>were built on Macquarie Street<br>um that's you know the mint the barracks<br>the parliament State Library this is<br>what governor Macquarie wanted to build<br>to show that Australia was a civilized<br>society<br>so we're looking at<br>um<br>you know ways in which we can kind of do<br>those connections to the cultural<br>landscape as Paul talked about we're<br>looking at where the water wants to flow<br>what the plants want to do how we can<br>open up the ground and plant endemic<br>species but also we'll probably plant<br>the huge Parkland next to it with Native<br>grasses and burn it every year in a<br>ceremony that actually washes smoke over<br>these colonial buildings<br>smoke smoke the buildings yes smoke the<br>buildings<br>um<br>really ultimately this all comes down to<br>engagement with community and there's a<br>whole nother<br>two-hour lecture on that which I won't<br>go into but there were figuring out all<br>of these different ways of engaging with<br>Community nobody is staying in their<br>Lane in terms of well I'm an architect<br>so I don't have to talk to this person<br>over here because we're seeing the most<br>cross transdisciplinary practice I think<br>the industries are saying which is<br>really exciting<br>but we're hoping that in some way it<br>will kind of lead to<br>an Australian design that is as old as<br>it it is which is 65 000 years old and a<br>new identity<br>wonderful thank you so<br>hold those questions those thoughts in<br>your mind we'd love you to have a little<br>brief break five minutes there's some<br>drinks outside have a drink come back in<br>would like to start at 527 okay and<br>um I thought the<br>presentation had been absolutely<br>mind-blowing<br>um<br>and very relatable in terms of I guess<br>my opinion and I know many of you as<br>well<br>um really really great to see some of<br>our young people here our students<br>because I want you guys to have a voice<br>tonight<br>and we've got these two knowledge<br>holders these two experts that would<br>really love to share what they know<br>anyways<br>um<br>I've just been scribbling the out<br>of this book since I I received it<br>um and I spoke to us earlier about how<br>relatable it was and I know did you know<br>it's my work very well and so does Mike<br>and Prof and uh Anthony huete and<br>Associate Prof Mike Davis<br>um<br>so I haven't been able to kind of put<br>this down<br>kind of leading up to these guys coming<br>so<br>but I'm gonna fire a question over to<br>Professor Allison and then over to Paul<br>and then um one each and then we'll open<br>the floor up to to anybody especially<br>our young people also okay so I took a<br>paragraph and I thought that we could<br>possibly elaborate further on this word<br>country<br>so it goes like this in the Indigenous<br>worldview<br>country means a way of seeing the world<br>everything is living there is no<br>separation between people and nature<br>it is multi-dimensional and extends<br>beyond the<br>the ground there is sea land and Sky<br>country as Anthropologist Deborah<br>Bird Rose wrote people talk about<br>country in the same way that they will<br>talk about a person<br>they speak to countries sing to Country<br>visit country worry about country feel<br>sorry for country and long for country<br>has dreaming Origins and a future the<br>term attempts to encapsulate a<br>sophisticated spiritual connection that<br>indigenous people have with the land<br>that extends Beyond ecology and includes<br>songs stories and kinship relationships<br>Allison<br>Yeah country it's we we actually<br>capitalize it with a c when we talk<br>about country and I think Paul probably<br>explained country better than I've ever<br>heard it before and in such a deep and<br>meaningful way<br>but it's interesting that you know we go<br>back to colonization and when you know<br>when cook arrived you know he bought<br>with him in 1770 a scientific voyage and<br>so in a way I think about<br>I think about the invasion of our<br>country and I think one of the most<br>Insidious<br>things that invaded with cook and the<br>ship was Western science<br>and this kind of taxonomic<br>classification of nature so suddenly all<br>of these different ologies became<br>separated<br>stars and the you know the weather and<br>um you know just the study of plants and<br>the study of animals all of it became<br>separated<br>and then<br>it said that itself has been you know I<br>mean we were talking about it the other<br>night and we'll just sort of say it was<br>like it's like some of the mess that is<br>created just by that one thing alone is<br>like this hideous fishing line that's<br>just been tangled up that that we've<br>just been trying to unravel<br>and then the thing that's me you know<br>that we talked about tonight which is<br>part of country as well is storytelling<br>it's and ceremony<br>and so the concept to to the Western<br>mind the concept of<br>um including storytelling in science<br>in you know having narrative medicines<br>and or things like that are just things<br>that you know are just too much of a<br>stretch<br>I think so in a way you know it's<br>interesting I look at my practice over<br>the last 25 years and I think well I'm a<br>filmmaker I do public art I do Urban<br>Design like there's nothing in what I<br>have done in the last 25 years that is<br>about staying in a box<br>just because I studied what I studied at<br>Uni like but you know it makes practice<br>really exciting it's amazing actually<br>and you know like we were talking this<br>morning about that shark<br>story<br>and I said to Paul well I'm sure there<br>must be something about the time of year<br>that the psych had not<br>um uh you know comes comes into flower<br>or ripens related to the breeding<br>patterns of the tiger shark there will<br>be no one's done that research yet<br>but you know to me that's actually such<br>an interesting idea about country being<br>this multi-dimensional relationship<br>between humans and nature and it goes<br>beyond it's it it includes all of our<br>spirituality and to me I think that's a<br>gift that all indigenous people have to<br>give to to to to non-indigenous people<br>can I just add to that about missing<br>country or in grieving for Country just<br>quickly read and excerpt from<br>Australia's writing a group of Honey Ant<br>Man leaves its old home at Yaba and goes<br>on a long journey West to papanya<br>another honey air to tamik Center<br>situated in country<br>for a time they March along the edge of<br>the Foothills fringing the Western<br>McDonald ranges and finally they come to<br>a curve in the low flanking range and<br>they know that La Yaba will Hereafter be<br>hidden hidden from their view so they<br>have for a moment a glance back towards<br>liaba they see the pale purple Peaks<br>which surrounded gleaming dim through<br>the fast Gathering Haze like a pool of<br>smoke the haze enfolds the hills and the<br>men grieve for the home which none of<br>them expects to see again and tears fall<br>from their eyes and their last chant<br>goes up<br>enfolded by planes lies liaba beyond the<br>far Horizon lies liaba enfolded by<br>planes lies larabar dimmed by The<br>enveloping Mists<br>they sing that over and over again<br>that's longing for home grieving for<br>country<br>that's beautiful Paul and I've never<br>heard of narrative healing<br>we're giving you a few to take<br>all right this one's to Paul and if you<br>want to elaborate or add further as well<br>Alison<br>um<br>Paul<br>wrote this uh paragraph and part of his<br>book here Australian Aboriginal<br>architecture<br>can therefore be defined as architecture<br>that is selected arranged and<br>constructed configuration of<br>environmental properties both natural<br>and artificial in and around one or more<br>activity spaces combined with patterns<br>of Behavioral rules and meanings to<br>result in human comfort and quality of<br>Lifestyle this definition Inc includes<br>selected environmental features mental<br>and behavioral rules spatial properties<br>hearts and artifacts it can also be<br>included include buildings but they are<br>not necessary it incorporates such<br>Concepts as social spatial<br>settlement structure avoidance behavior<br>diversity of construction detailing and<br>its impact on spatial experience and<br>ceremonial spaces imbued with meaning<br>you don't have to answer that<br>well we talked we said before that um<br>house<br>isn't home in Aboriginal constructs and<br>architecture isn't buildings its place<br>in Aboriginal construct<br>and<br>um<br>that that the penny clicked<br>after like doing a lot of field trips<br>with old men working on land rights<br>claims<br>and the oldest man<br>my my big brother<br>through skin Patty Woodman<br>at first well his younger brother used<br>to advise me but and then he died and<br>then I put the older brother in the back<br>of the Toyota and he didn't say anything<br>and we're going through country I'm<br>saying is there a sacred site here no no<br>all the young men are saying keep going<br>we've got more to go you know and then<br>I'd say<br>um but after a long time I realized that<br>old Patty's sitting in the back but he<br>was talking sign language to the young<br>men wasn't their knowledge it was his<br>knowledge<br>in the evening I'd say where are we<br>going to Camp because we'd just be<br>camping in the open in swags and um<br>making fires<br>I'd say here's a good place it's getting<br>and then we'd go a bit further and I'd<br>say Patty I'm hungry it's getting late<br>it's getting dark this firewood there<br>look<br>and he'd keep we'd keep going until he<br>saw a place<br>that was the right place and it was<br>always a Grove of gidgee trees<br>and in the gidgee Groves<br>they have a lot of needles falling down<br>and the and they can easily be swept<br>aside so that you've got soft sand and<br>there are you can observe tracks of<br>snakes or centipedes and and have some<br>degree of safety like that<br>the wood of the tree burns very well you<br>can burn burn it without Ash so you can<br>make hot coals with no Ash which means<br>you can put a steak on top of the coals<br>and cook it and then eat it with your<br>hand and have no charcoal or Ash in your<br>mouth<br>and then in the morning you can wake up<br>with these birds in the trees and all<br>night you can have the wind blowing in<br>these leaves giving you this sound<br>and as soon as the young man had got the<br>firewood and we sat around the fire<br>Patty would recite the country<br>reciting the country means telling<br>everything<br>in the cultural landscape<br>calling the names of the ancestral<br>beings explaining what happened there<br>and what happened there and where we are<br>and calling out to the country and<br>telling them we're here and that and to<br>keep us safe and then going into the<br>contact history and what happened in<br>revolver time<br>of colonization that Alison was talking<br>about and people were getting killed and<br>having to flee<br>all of that gets packed into the evening<br>as these steaks cook on the coals<br>and if it rained we'd get a tarp out of<br>the out of the car and put it over the<br>top of one of these trees to make a roof<br>and the young men would dig a drainage<br>drain around the side and would be all<br>sleeping under the tree with a tarp over<br>the top and perfectly with a fire<br>perfectly warm and and out of the rain<br>and that was that was what was<br>positioning on country that was suddenly<br>I realized that's architecture<br>and it's Comfort it's knowing how to<br>establish comfort with the minimal but<br>in the right place and in the right<br>cultural lens and it's about<br>understanding function<br>so from an Aboriginal perspective is<br>beyond the comfort of surface the<br>vegetation the position of the sun<br>uh the prevailing winds all of that is<br>important of course but there is this um<br>more intangible Dimension this<br>locational principle<br>which while the young men were designing<br>the wind breaks and the beds and you<br>know<br>the old man would be reciting country<br>and so there's a whole chapter in the<br>book about how that can be a blueprint<br>for Urban Design for designing a city<br>Square<br>you know like why not<br>or designing a great public space a<br>meeting place<br>you know there are principles Within<br>within the design of those early or<br>camps<br>um that you can use to to make<br>contemporary architecture because of<br>course you know we're never starting<br>with a Greenfield site we're never you<br>know we have to sort of undo a lot of<br> in a lot of places<br>there's also that contemporary layer of<br>history as well that needs to be<br>acknowledged because quite even within<br>our culture as new materials came in<br>stories were adapted and changed to<br>accommodate those new materials rules<br>were changed to accommodate the new<br>materials<br>you know and also there were new new<br>stories created to tell those historical<br>references so in a way it's all there<br>in terms of how how would you approach<br>it if you get approach to do a school in<br>you know this place over here you know<br>the ingredients and the essence of<br>intent is there and that's what that's<br>what architecture is it's beyond the<br>walls and the roofs and you know who's<br>I'm gonna sneaky and I'm just gonna<br>pull<br>Louis Thompson and he's a very good<br>friend of yours he was<br>well<br>I'm a bit too emotional to talk easy<br>about that but<br>deirdre's here and she introduced me to<br>riwi and um<br>we we struck it off together and<br>he taught me all I know a lot of a lot<br>of what I know about<br>Maori culture and and places in Auckland<br>and he took me to<br>and to the Mirai and<br>and all the other powers Etc around the<br>place and<br>and he allowed me then to bring my<br>students here and he gave them design<br>assignments here<br>to bring out to you know teach them<br>about cultural knowledge of Maori people<br>and then he and Deirdre took students<br>back to Brisbane and we reciprocated and<br>um Deidre and then Deidre and I sat down<br>with him and Deidre wanted to know how<br>she could set up some equivalent of our<br>Research Center in Auckland and<br>and that's when riwi thought of the name<br>tapare<br>which is to do with the entrance to the<br>Mariah<br>can mean different things the threshold<br>this the liminal space the lentil<br>the stepping into the Sacred Space all<br>of those things and<br>he because of his love of Rugby Union he<br>was regularly coming to you know Sydney<br>and Brisbane for tests and that and he<br>took and I introduced him to the<br>youngest Aboriginal architecture<br>students<br>um<br>yeah and he mentored them while Deidre<br>and him arranged me to contact Bill<br>Royal and Perry royal and learn about<br>Fortuna Chapel by John Scott<br>and understand the history of indigenous<br>architecture in New Zealand which was a<br>generation ahead of the indigenous<br>architecture<br>amongst the young people in Australia<br>and they all<br>they all loved him at that time<br>and he was their mentor and then<br>um we will now open it up to the floor<br>if you 've been we've got budding<br>Architects here and students alike<br>so if anybody got a question or<br>questions for our guests here and now<br>will be a perfect time<br>and then I'll give it to Charmaine to I<br>should have mentioned Mike in that<br>formula too Mike was very heavily<br>involved in those years<br>just acknowledging how comats were<br>Mike Austin as well sorry Mike<br>does anybody have questions or<br>hi I'm Andrew Barry um I've I've been<br>looking Paul at your book and one of the<br>things that's really kind of startling<br>for her for a kiwi looking at that book<br>is<br>um is how slight the architecture is you<br>know the kind of shelters and windbreaks<br>you know to a to a kind of Western<br>perspective even even to a kind of uh um<br>with an understanding of Maori<br>architecture it's this there's not not<br>very much stuff<br>and so I'm kind of I'm I wonder if you<br>could talk more about how you've been<br>able to kind of draw that knowledge<br>forward because I imagine a lot of it's<br>been erased<br>um you know it's one of the things<br>um you know lots of um our understanding<br>of kind of early Maori architecture just<br>relies essentially on kind of archeology<br>and so that it must have been even kind<br>of harder<br>I'm not sure which book you're talking<br>about but in ganya Gundy and Worley um<br>I clearly I clearly Define the fact that<br>I'm I've only started the research<br>there's a lot more research to do in<br>different regions every region in<br>Australia I concluded had a regional<br>repertoire of shelters that were used<br>people were<br>mobile within their territories well in<br>those Clan Estates that I describe<br>people knew all that country they've<br>moved around it the whole time and then<br>they moved into neighbors countries and<br>when they were moving they needed they<br>didn't need in you know really sedentary<br>shelters but where what I identified in<br>the book clearly was where there were<br>where there was inclement weather<br>for long periods of time and<br>good resources<br>then more sedentary or semi-cedentary<br>architecture evolved and so if we look<br>at the you know we're in Auckland your<br>weather here is similar to the West<br>Coast of Tasmania those fronts that come<br>across and the southwest of Western<br>Australia and the west of Victoria<br>all that's in those you know West those<br>southerly winds coming around screaming<br>around the bottom of the globe and<br>that's where we find the sedentary<br>Aboriginal architecture<br>and there we can find like cladding like<br>up to three or four cladding layers and<br>the stone walls of the gundijmara people<br>and the um and the use of the mud<br>thatching and the lining with feathers<br>and things so<br>um<br>and then again there are other areas<br>where there was uh more semi-sedentary<br>architecture like the rainforest in<br>Northwest Northeast Queensland where<br>there was you know heavy rainfall<br>in the old where the patterns through<br>the wet season and people would then be<br>Sheltering inside for weeks on end and<br>that's when the shelter roofs went<br>higher because people needed to stand up<br>inside the shelters and the image that<br>Alison showed was was intersecting Dome<br>so people developed technology out of<br>lawyer canes to make intersecting domes<br>structures which allowed numerous house<br>families to live in the one extended<br>shelter and be able to socially interact<br>out of the rain so all those patterns<br>are in place<br>sort of two things I think or big<br>factors was one we had to abandon 80 of<br>the land mass to survive climate like<br>the Ice Age like 80 percent<br>so you know<br>I just don't think they could really<br>afford to not have adaptation<br>inherently built and flexibility<br>inherently built into their architecture<br>so and you know and it also helped on a<br>day-to-day basis too with just going<br>where the food was and also managing<br>um<br>uh you know there's amazing systems of<br>managing<br>um uh food source you know like we've<br>we've hunted too much in this area let's<br>move over here that kind of thing<br>and the climate calendar because it<br>changed right so and then the second<br>thing is that we you know I look at them<br>what I and you know we were at um<br>uh<br>yeah<br>um yesterday yeah and<br>um<br>you know<br>there's there's heavy ceremonial like<br>once you start building that kind of<br>heavy kind of ceremonial elements into<br>buildings then you're not going to get<br>rid of them are you right<br>and you know and I think that's that's<br>a sort of we we had a lot of ceremonial<br>places but our ceremonial places were<br>um a lot of them were ephemeral<br>you know it we would spend weeks on end<br>making elaborate sand paintings that<br>would be danced on and destroyed we'd<br>spend weeks on end making incredible<br>headdresses that would ultimately<br>just you know decompose or burn you know<br>so it's we never kind of I suppose<br>combined the two really<br>but that's not saying that those places<br>weren't sacred and we didn't have sacred<br>poles we had sacred<br>um you know I suppose if you look at the<br>evidence now of our occupation in terms<br>of cave walls that had paintings very<br>elaborate paintings on them those those<br>were almost our churches if you like<br>in my book there's a chapter on meaning<br>in architecture in Aboriginal<br>architecture and I say that the most<br>elaborate meanings were in ceremonial<br>architecture<br>but though it was destroyed after the<br>ceremony<br>the most energy was put into that<br>people the hunter-gatherer life allowed<br>actually allowed people a lot of<br>recreational time<br>and um<br>time to do you know religious<br>practices so um<br>unfortunately but<br>we're not allowed to talk too much about<br>what was in a lot of those ceremonies so<br>I haven't written a book on that yet<br>there are photographs available if you<br>want to look for them<br>yeah but the um<br>but I think that that's big you know<br>that that that's why they're<br>I think we were considered Savages<br>because we didn't have an architecture<br>or an agriculture that was obvious I<br>think that's why you got a treaty here<br>there's a big debate about this I don't<br>know whether you've heard of it here the<br>dark emu debate<br>um<br>but it was so sustainable or slight in<br>your words that it was<br>they just couldn't see it yeah and so we<br>were considered<br>um you know Savages that that you know<br>and in fact when we actually look at how<br>sustainable it was in terms of you know<br>native grasses apparently our Grain Belt<br>was five times the size of the<br>Australian wheat belt is now<br>you know no irrigation no pesticides<br>that or the soils were so aerated there<br>was nothing on this wide Brown land I<br>mean that's ridiculous yeah yeah there<br>was this Mosaic burning which you know<br>will now be exporting to South America<br>to probably Hawaii now I would say<br>um that these knowledges were so<br>sophisticated that in fact you know we<br>were quite advanced<br>but you know unfortunately we still<br>don't have any rights and in fact we're<br>going to a referendum in you know a few<br>weeks time<br>for an Advisory Group to government and<br>it's probably going to be a no vote from<br>the Australian people<br>and the news people on New Zealand TV<br>this morning was shocked and horrified<br>about the attitude of the Australian<br>public it wouldn't was so mean to not<br>recognize Aboriginal rights<br>this is taken for granted here<br>um<br>Allison for that and you've just picked<br>me I had a question relating in a few<br>weeks time Australia's going to a<br>referendum and I'll just read out the<br>the question that a proposed law to<br>alter the Constitution to recognize the<br>First Peoples of Australia by<br>establishing an Aboriginal and tourist<br>stray Islander voice<br>do you approve this proposed alteration<br>and as somebody who's lucky enough last<br>week to be on country in bungaru the<br>popular media indicators which I saw<br>suggested that the answer to the<br>referendum was going to be a no<br>and I just wondered if you could reflect<br>or um on the<br>contemporary Australian psyche<br>which is going to lead to a very futile<br>can you speak to that<br>or speak more to that space<br>I've had a couple of glass of wine now<br>so just hold me back<br>call me back because I've been involved<br>in Conrad for like 10 years right<br>and there was there has been this<br>amazing since the 1990s this amazing<br>movement of reconciliation in Australia<br>right and which actually<br>that is the things we're talking about<br>tonight around these planning laws and<br>everything<br>it's because of that reconciliation<br>um all of these so we had this this body<br>established called reconciliation<br>Australia they got all of these big<br>companies to sign up to that those<br>companies have these reconciliation<br>action plans which force all of their<br>workers to do cultural awareness<br>training right that forces them so you<br>know Karen and Darren and Sharon that<br>live in Queensland and it just from a<br>long line of bloody racists have to sit<br>in a room and listened to some of the<br>stuff we talked about tonight but they<br>come out of it and they're like<br>oh that's all right isn't it<br>you know I don't mind that or they<br>actually learn about some of the wide<br>Australian policies and they also<br>learned that you know what it's not the<br>Australian people's fault what happened<br>to Aboriginal people it's England's<br>fault<br>no one is like pointing to the Real<br>Enemy here you know the people who<br>actually bought smallpox over and<br>created the most beautiful jail on Earth<br>and sometimes when I'm fishing up in<br>item land I think the joke's on England<br>because the place is so beautiful you<br>know and I think Australians just have<br>to realize that no one's blaming them<br>it's just about actually I mean I I<br>really honestly think there were three<br>parts to<br>the ulery statement from the heart which<br>this referendum has come out come come<br>from and one of them is about the voice<br>which is about basically an Advisory<br>Group you know to tell the government<br>how to do things better in Aboriginal<br>communities because they've failed for<br>so long the second part was about<br>truth-telling and it's about actually<br>uncovering some of this uncomfortable<br>history<br>and the third part is treaty I mean I<br>think they should have started with<br>treat telling<br>because once we actually start delving<br>into that history<br>who would ever say no what heartless<br>bastard would ever say no because also<br>too we'd realize that it's not I think<br>that the right-wing sort of Liberal<br>Party in Australia have always played<br>that card of the black armband view of<br>History you know like you're just<br>blaming us<br>and so Karen and Darren and Sharon just<br>start to get their back up and just go<br>well it's not my fault I didn't come<br>over on the first flight you know and so<br>you know like it just causes this issue<br>and they play on it you know and it's<br>it's I think it's part of the sort of<br>last ditch white knuckled kind of grab<br>it sort of you know<br>power for them<br>but it will be a blow to Australia will<br>not be the same the day after the<br>referendum<br>in a way it'll be interesting I think<br>that age of reconciliation if it fails<br>but being a Prisoner of Hope<br>I am looking at the bright side of that<br>because Malcolm X says that once you're<br>begging for your rights you're not never<br>going to be free and all Aboriginal<br>people have done in the last 250 years<br>is big<br>and I'm sick of it<br>you know I'm sick of it and so<br>I'll be out on the streets I used to be<br>one of the most diplomatic people on<br>Earth but I won't be after that and I<br>think a lot of white Australians will be<br>angry too and we'll actually just go you<br>know what<br>no we're not going to be nice anymore<br>all right oh okay great well time is<br>short<br>um just as we move the mic over to our<br>colleague here I understand there's a<br>number of students here<br>and would be a Miss to miss a question<br>for them<br>so first of July<br>laws changed about citizenship in<br>Australia right so there's bound to be a<br>flurry<br>a tsunami of New Zealand architectural<br>graduates heading over to Australia<br>yeah<br>okay money's good registration's<br>question one sentence<br>what would you say advise<br>our New Zealand architectural graduates<br>about understanding country and really<br>really really<br>being sincere about how they design with<br>it's a really long time to build those<br>relationships and to to build that<br>you're talking about in Australia or New<br>Zealand<br>yeah<br>plenty of maraises<br>very important<br>one message we've put tonight is to<br>understand<br>your own cultural landscape understand<br>and your own prejudices<br>well thanks very much for coming to<br>speak to us today<br>um I'm fascinated by the idea of shared<br>history you know one that has spanned 65<br>6500<br>years it's very much informed by the<br>land and defined by the country and the<br>other one which is<br>um you know even in the span of one<br>generation iterated and reiterated<br>um so you know in this sort of<br>reconciliation I'm curious to what do<br>you and both Envision the new Australian<br>design to be<br>and how can that help us create the<br>story together<br>rather than a shared story that might be<br>uncomfortable<br>you said six thousand five hundred sixty<br>well you know the new Australian design<br>is a process<br>at this stage<br>so what we understand it to be is what<br>we've outlined is is all parties<br>including the corporate bodies the<br>clients the money holders<br>going through a process of understanding<br>about the need to<br>reset the compass on Australian identity<br>and to engage with Aboriginal<br>communities and Country<br>but there's a last paragraph in our book<br>sums it up and Allison wrote that she<br>said I can tell her she's going to read<br>yeah<br>you're ready for it<br>a flag that's actually our flagged it<br>filamentally<br>there's a new Awakening fueled by<br>ecological necessity to redesign our<br>future and the relationship that we as<br>people have with nature in each other<br>we can design our built environments to<br>be a part of the managed Landscapes that<br>form the basis of First Nations ecology<br>since time Memorial<br>now objects interiors and places can be<br>an extension of the song lines that<br>crisscross this country in every<br>direction and are a Web of Knowledge<br>embedded in our everyday lives<br>this new Australian design will improve<br>the well-being of people and create<br>places that ultimately mean more to all<br>of us it will extend country not<br>abrogated and should be created with<br>that in mind because we are all<br>but it brings to mind<br>the senior man whoever he was in that we<br>saw in the Auckland museum with a class<br>of<br>10 year olds 10 year olds with a map of<br>the migrations through the Pacific<br>to<br>otoroa and asking the children<br>where did the people come from<br>who were they when did it happen all of<br>these questions about their identity and<br>the support and they all answered the<br>questions they were clever students here<br>so it's it's getting in it's bringing<br>that education right back down to<br>preschool level<br>and changing the Mind attitudes of<br>people<br>foreign so we can embed the curriculum<br>into schools so people are actually<br>walking around we're walking spatially<br>right I've just been given a nod by my<br>A-Plus students I've got to give them<br>the mic just very very quick question<br>and then we'll get on to the next part<br>my question comes around from learning<br>Maori and Pacific Design of course that<br>we've been doing here<br>and I heard you talk about the term VA<br>for your architecture and culture what<br>does the term far mean and also how does<br>I'm still learning about what VAR means<br>um I did examine Albert Graffiti's<br>thesis so I have a bit of an idea it's<br>PhD thesis<br>and I had I've had conversations with<br>llama about this but<br>VAR is<br>the breathing of space the activation of<br>space the spirit of space<br>and being able to recognize that and<br>and<br>I'm not<br>I'm not sort of you know knowledgeable<br>enough to talk about how Pacifica people<br>do that<br>um<br>I tried to offer an explanation as to<br>how Aboriginal people might do that and<br>the best way I can offer it is through<br>an understanding of the cultural<br>landscape and it's what we've been<br>talking about tonight it's<br>old paddy reciting the country it's<br>knowing the places in the environment<br>it's knowing the meaning of the<br>environment in of the meaning of the<br>places in the environment<br>as a total collection of places<br>including habitation places resource<br>places dispute resolution places<br>ceremonial places Body Disposal places<br>all of those and many more you can<br>rattle off the number<br>and understanding how it all fits<br>together and how it activates mental<br>space cognitive space<br>and brings life into the country but<br>it's also overlaid with having the<br>belief in the energies<br>permeating from the sacred sites that<br>extend out from those sacred sites<br>as an anthropologist who's been<br>paid to go and record sacred sites for<br>the government most of them have site<br>protection acts in statutory legislation<br>you're asked to put a a boundary around<br>a sacred site so the question becomes<br>well what's the sphere of influence of<br>the site how far does the energy how far<br>does the site go how far does its energy<br>permeate<br>and you've got a bunch of traditional<br>owners there<br>it's a very hard question is we're going<br>to put a line a line around it but um<br>so you know what Paul's talking about is<br>deep time relationship that that affects<br>the sort of bar between people but if<br>you're going to create a meeting place<br>between people you use fire<br>in our culture fire is healing fire is<br>everything fire is energy so I could<br>create the most sacred place on Earth<br>just by putting a fire right there<br>between Paul and I<br>you know so that becomes the kind of<br>everyday<br>um<br>animator of energy<br>I made a joke before about particle<br>physics but I think we're moving we're<br>in a time where you young people are in<br>a time when we're moving back to<br>particle physics<br>when I was a young fellow we had protons<br>and neutrons and electrons<br>and now I think there's 22 or 24<br>particles that they know about<br>so actually you know even physics now<br>supports the idea that there are<br>particles flowing around here but<br>through my body passing through my body<br>and they're permeating Cosmic Energies<br>and which brings us back to all of the<br>ancient religions of the world and the<br>big question about who are we and where<br>are we going where do we come from<br>good point in the<br>it's really really awesome on behalf of<br>the party of the School of Architecture<br>and planning<br>also our professors

narrative healing<br>foreign<br>navigate a star shine bright on the<br>Endeavors that you have in front of you<br>especially pushing these issues for the<br>better of country<br>may you blow the wind
