The campus is home to the largest wind tunnel in New Zealand.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>foreign<br>how kites perform<br>in general so we use the wind tunnel to<br>fly kites inside<br>and the competition is basically about<br>the performance the design performance<br>of the guides how how long they can fly<br>without crashing how strong they can<br>resist the wind as well<br>um let's go to the materials you have<br>today so you can see each team has been<br>it uses the wind speed the wind speed<br>that it can withstand and how well works<br>at the Target I believe in simple<br>designs like the simple you go the and<br>the more functional probably you would<br>get you can just use a box you can use a<br>cardboard box and make it as a guide<br>like the same concept of a parachute and<br>and it worked we tested that before yeah<br>so first place price is 300.<br>the evening second place is 200 and<br>third place is 100. so that's three out<br>aerodynamics love is is actually it has<br>one of the biggest wind tunnels in New<br>Zealand<br>um it's a closed loop internal so it<br>Loops the wind inside and it's usually<br>it's designed to investigate atmospheric<br>boundary layers and on how the wind<br>influence structures and buildings we<br>also test anything that is related to<br>block body aerodynamics so you don't<br>need a formula you just need wind<br>hitting the plug body and see what how<br>it behaves uh what the what the team<br>needs to be successful is design skills<br>definitely<br>um<br>and knowledge of aerodynamics with their<br>physical design as well the the third<br>skill I think they could do is<br>proper communication skills and<br>teamworking skills as well of being<br>stranded on deserted desert island and<br>with no one to help us stack we had to<br>apply all of our engineering knowledge<br>in order to get off this island<br>see here here's our final design and we<br>used all the steps in the design process<br>that we've been taught throughout<br>University and our internships we<br>started with a bit of research we found<br>a couple of different designs which we<br>prototyped and tested in the Wind Tunnel<br>which you can see here and following<br>that testing we decided that this was<br>our best one to move forward with so we<br>built a full-scale design and tested<br>that again iterated it and came up with<br>our final design which we're going to<br>in the first place want to come up and<br>shake hands with their prize we really<br>liked that you guys also had a very<br>clear design process for this one so<br>very happy that water bottle got first<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
