have<br>the real honor and privilege of Hosting<br>this inaugural professorial lecture this<br>evening<br>so a very warm welcome to all of you<br>gathered here in Castle lecture theater<br>in person a very warm greeting to<br>everyone who was online both at this<br>very moment or who may be watching in<br>the future<br>these are very special events the fact<br>that we are wearing our robes is an<br>indicator of that<br>in the modern University a list of<br>modern University of otago we do not<br>wear the robes very often we really<br>Rhythm and when we do it's a sign of a<br>special occasion so two main examples<br>are a graduation when we come together<br>to celebrate our students<br>culminate the culmination of their<br>academic journey and their graduation<br>and these inaugural professorial<br>lectures when we come together to<br>celebrate the success the quality the<br>distinguished careers of our academic<br>colleagues who have been promoted to the<br>highest rank within the university the<br>rank or professor<br>these events are also special because<br>they celebrate activities that are the<br>very heart of the University<br>the scholarly Journal journal the<br>scholarly Journey<br>teaching research service for the<br>discipline for the academic unit and in<br>support of our students and our<br>stakeholding communities so these are an<br>opportunity for us to come together and<br>to celebrate those things that really<br>make the university the University<br>so this evening we come together to<br>celebrate the outstanding career of<br>Professor McBride and his contributions<br>as a researcher as a teacher and as a<br>member of our community here at the<br>University of otago<br>these are also opportunities for us to<br>hear the newly promoted staff member<br>reflect on their journey to look back<br>but also to look forward and to to take<br>stock of what their career has produced<br>so far but maybe also think about what<br>the future might hold for the discipline<br>or the area so we look forward to<br>hearing your Reflections Professor<br>McBride<br>so Katie that's enough for me it's just<br>wonderful to see everybody and I'm now<br>delighted to hand over to Emeritus<br>professor John Broughton who will<br>provide a fuller introduction of<br>Ator gives me great pleasure this<br>evening to introduce Professor David<br>McBride AKA Lieutenant Colonel McBride<br>and someone who I had the pleasure of to<br>work with in veterans health research in<br>the department of preventive and social<br>medicine of the otago Dunedin school of<br>medicine and a special welcome to Dave's<br>extended family and friends who are here<br>with us this evening<br>Professor McBride is an occupational<br>environmental physician a clinical<br>discipline of which military medicine is<br>a sub-specialty this particular area of<br>research expertise lies in occupational<br>and environmental epidemiology and<br>biostatistics<br>his clinical interests lie in the<br>effects of physical agents noise and<br>vibration chemical agents particularly<br>persistence<br>organochlorine compounds and toxins the<br>effects of Psychosocial environment in<br>veterans health<br>his military connections as a reverse<br>reservist has given him insights into<br>military health he joined the Queen's<br>University in Belfast office's training<br>Corps in 1974 and was commissioned into<br>the Royal Court of Transport as a second<br>tenant in 1981 and on coming to New<br>Zealand he thought he had retired but no<br>he joined we wanted to see an Army<br>Medical Corps in 1995 going on to<br>command the attack on South regiment in<br>2000 with operational experience in both<br>East Timor and Afghanistan<br>David will Enlighten us this evening on<br>the scope of Occupational Medicine and<br>Veterans Health with an emphasis on the<br>treasure transition from military to<br>civilian life and the well-being of<br>contemporary veterans please join me in<br>welcoming Professor David McBride to the<br>podium<br>well<br>I never thought I'd be standing here<br>and I expect you didn't either but<br>however<br>Occupational Medicine how does that work<br>people often ask me that what is<br>occupational therapy no Occupational<br>Medicine<br>preventing hazards becoming health risk<br>is what's all about and we classify<br>hazards chemical physical noise and<br>vibration biological bacterias bacteria<br>virus and moles and ergonomic or<br>here's an example I'll often use we have<br>a carpenter a joiner<br>in fact this chops a Furniture maker so<br>you know you've got to you've got to get<br>your job titles right for a start and<br>he's doing a thing called conversion he<br>selected a piece of wood and he's called<br>a cutter seems a simple process eh<br>so the way we look at preventing<br>occupational disease is through source<br>from the source of the material he's<br>using<br>and the thing he's using to cut it then<br>we look at the path to the receiver and<br>then we look at the receiver himself in<br>this case<br>and it's not just about<br>looking it's about a careful look and<br>Analysis and if you look closely you can<br>see he hasn't got his hearing protection<br>on quite right<br>and neither are the glasses quite right<br>so that's going to fail for a start<br>right and then we need to think about<br>so the source is here and it's the piece<br>of wood he's cutting whatever that piece<br>of wood is made of we'll talk about that<br>shortly and if you look carefully with<br>the eye of faith<br>can you or not<br>just there and that stops the saw ring<br>because if you think it was circular saw<br>there's a ringing sound and there's<br>noise from the gears and there's noise<br>from the blower motor that all gets<br>slogged out so that's the depth of<br>detail<br>we need to go into and here's the risk<br>management process this is it in a<br>nutshell<br>um zaidi and I from the Department have<br>been asked to write a chapter for<br>Hunter's diseases of occupation<br>so it's all about the risk management<br>be back back shortly at a strategic<br>level<br>it's going to go wrong it will you can<br>see at the top that government and<br>tertiary bodies identify hazards or<br>sometimes<br>it's an alert clinician to identify the<br>thing as a hazard and then we look to<br>say a dose response relationship which<br>you've got no the mechanism<br>and then from that we can set exposure<br>standards so that's all epidemiology up<br>at the top basically<br>then we come over to the workplace and<br>we come into the workplace and do an<br>exposure assessment I've just done a<br>short one there right and we do a risk<br>characterization estimation lastly<br>we design the control strategy do some<br>monitoring which is where we start to<br>feel right do some monitoring of<br>whatever it is and then assess the<br>health effect in the workplace and we're<br>doing that very badly and lastly we have<br>Education and Training<br>which also isn't done well people have<br>to know what they're dealing with<br>okay so those two could do with being<br>done better<br>so the workplace exposure standard for<br>hardwood dust is 0.5 milligrams per<br>meter cubed because it's a carcinogen<br>for soft wood dust it's two milligrams<br>per meter cubes because it's a<br>sensitizer and nothing works with that<br>enforcement and this is where we fall<br>down all the time nothing works like the<br>red traffic lights in Dunedin don't work<br>control in a nutshell maintenance has<br>always sort of top of a list Education<br>and Training to alter behavioral<br>influences behavior is important one<br>must be well behaved or one must<br>understand how people behave in the<br>workplace<br>then we have maintenance because the<br>gear is logged out it's going to be<br>lighter and it's going to create more<br>dust and lastly<br>and the thing that's most often used New<br>Zealand personal protective equipment<br>should be the last thing in the list but<br>it's often not right<br>so Moira Chan young was a respiratory<br>physician and she worked at the uh<br>worked at the Sawmills in Burlesque<br>Colombia<br>and she was no interesting noticing an<br>awful lot of asthma in the soil Mill<br>workers<br>the only important that they um they<br>imported the red cedar into Australia<br>because it was cheap on the nightbreak<br>of Occupational Arsenal there so that's<br>their student Commission<br>and the substance responsible was<br>plecatic acid<br>now we also have wood acids<br>here in New Zealand and want such as one<br>as for as10ar one two three four four a<br>nine ten ten octahydro six hydroxy 1<br>4.148<br>methylphenatharine one carboxylic acid<br>just to give us its full name<br>the mechanisms now you know about pm10<br>PM 2.5 and PM 0.1<br>pm10s used in the standard environmental<br>standards because you can breathe it in<br>right PM 2.5 is what can get into the<br>chest<br>PM 2.5 would want to get right down<br>to the<br>alveoli<br>oops<br>for example Asbestos and we still don't<br>know how asbestos gets to the periphery<br>and the mechanism<br>by which it causes plural mesothelioma<br>so there's still a lot to learn<br>so here's something I use when I teach<br>the medical students right give them<br>clinical examples of what's going on<br>this is asthma I don't know whether it's<br>asthma called a wood dust or no but it's<br>a type 1 Hypersonic reaction<br>inflammation of the bronchi and<br>eventually the smooth muscle gets<br>thicker and the mucous layer gets<br>thicker<br>and then you get mucus mucous secretion<br>mucus plugging on ventilation perfusion<br>abnormality which was teaching the<br>medical students the week before last<br>was just a simple way<br>of making a link between discipline<br>which is what they get wrong all the<br>time they're not making those links<br>between disciplines<br>simple way of doing it now we did this<br>in 1998 measuring wood dust because this<br>is something that's never well<br>controlled right<br>so in 1998 you can see what the levels<br>were the range was 0.45 down here to<br>30.58 and 46 percent were in excess of<br>fast forward to 2017 Jerome doers and<br>the folks from Maasai did another study<br>geometric Amino 2.5 0.4 to 48.4 a huge<br>difference between those two surveys and<br>all that time<br>and I think the last time we did a<br>respiratory survey<br>and a sawmill<br>properly was probably in somewhere 2000<br>2001 so it's not good<br>regulation and enforcement 1992 wasn't<br>too bad the health and safety<br>unemployment Occupational Safety and<br>Health Service Department of Labor<br>we had departmental deep practitioners<br>one on each wash office I was one here<br>in Dunedin about 14 total and two senior<br>dmps<br>um Evan dreyson and Chris walls up at<br>headquarters in Wellington<br>then on 19th November 2010 things<br>changed with Pike River and the coal<br>mine<br>they brought in the health and safety<br>work act 2015 formed work safe and all<br>of a sudden we had no doctors at all we<br>had one doctor for about two years who<br>resigned<br>but that was it<br>no doctor so we've gone backwards there<br>I'm afraid so how do you get to be a<br>professor<br>um well first you go to school and you<br>get good grades and then you get into<br>medical school and 50 years later then<br>you do distinguished things<br>you do teaching you do research and you<br>do community service all good<br>so that's what is occupational medicine<br>right it's simple really you just<br>translate those hazards into something<br>else psychosocial hazards military<br>service<br>a group of people is an artificial<br>intelligence wonderful look there's a<br>group of people on military uniforms<br>so when I went to school I made the big<br>mistake of joining the armaged out force<br>and learning how to perform undetected<br>crime which John was talking about<br>earlier<br>because of your 12 years of undetected<br>crime you get recognized for it right<br>through the Trekkers and ask any soldier<br>on the X solder this<br>or any serving Soldier that's the most<br>here's a good example of us way back<br>then the place called Hammer with the<br>second Battalion the Royal Irish Rangers<br>and you can see some of these children<br>are whiffing bottles of what looks like<br>champagne around<br>at 16 and 17 crime<br>shocking what undetected crime so it was<br>fine not a problem<br>so having gone through that experience<br>of being in the arm get out first and<br>all the rest of that stuff I came to do<br>my a levels in medical school and<br>what will you know I've got to see Rd in<br>a real pass and I had to get three b's<br>by Christmas<br>so um I was offered a job as a health<br>inspector and I thought no<br>I'll go back I'll do it again I want to<br>be a physician so I went back to school<br>and converted the D<br>I converted three a day in a row passed<br>to three days I got the ban Chemistry by<br>Christmas so I was off and I got there<br>in the end I had to do it for my mother<br>because she was so upset<br>that I didn't get an authentic<br>hypnotical school so that's where I did<br>um here we go so what was it like to be<br>in medical school<br>right why did I go to medical school in<br>because my father was a post office<br>telephone engineer<br>um a Mueller was a teacher<br>and for some some reason I ended up<br>quite a lot with my father<br>in the van<br>um<br>one of my mother's favorite expression<br>was for God's sake sit down and show up<br>David So suppose it was a respite care<br>but I went with my father around never<br>nearly every telephone exchange and<br>counted down looking at the equipment<br>poking my fingers and not getting mildly<br>injured having mild shocks and learning<br>about how things work<br>and it's fascinated me ever since<br>so here's a group of medical students<br>and Sandy Mount Street in Belfast it was<br>really no different apart from bombs and<br>bullets from Medical School anywhere<br>and I worked my way through because my<br>father had to pay for the first Year's<br>fees and tuition we thought that's<br>hugely not fair so how to get a job and<br>you know the most reliable job was with<br>the Officers Training Corps<br>so going to summer camps and all those<br>things<br>and the other thing was joining the<br>Royal Ulster constabulary as a reserve<br>Constable that was a reliable employment<br>as well<br>so we used to go home on a Friday<br>remember the Saturday morning I was out<br>in Jude and on a Sunday I was out in<br>Judean sometimes Monday as well but it<br>was really reliable employment for all<br>the school holidays<br>it was Bloody dangerous but um it was<br>reliable<br>um and it funded certain activities if<br>you could imagine what those activities<br>were and medical when I went to medical<br>school all the Macs stayed together<br>all the MCAS and mcps did together<br>because they didn't have computers in<br>those days<br>I don't have been a terrible chore to<br>start moving people around so we all got<br>to know each other really really well<br>there's Maria McCarthy right at the<br>right hand side there and just it was<br>good<br>we enjoyed it then eventually you<br>graduate artificial intelligence was<br>working in this case a couple of men<br>graduation grounds<br>and after you graduate then you can<br>think what I want to do<br>for a living but I am not a physician<br>so I thought I'd give EMT surgery ago<br>I'd always been sort of fascinated to be<br>int surgery it was something to do with<br>the head mirrors<br>I've still got mine<br>because it required quite a lot of skill<br>to wear it properly to wear it properly<br>for a start but to use it to focus the<br>light and see people's vocal cords and<br>their larynx and into their ears and was<br>very good at tearing tonsils out<br>so that was good and I was reasonably<br>happy as a<br>an ENT senior house officer<br>we met Jeff Crowther<br>was lasso<br>so Jeff and I were talking one day and<br>he said<br>I'm sick of this what do you think I<br>should do and they said become an<br>occupational physician he said huh what<br>do you mean occupational possession I<br>told him about what the job was because<br>I knew what the job was<br>he said right and he went and got a job<br>as chief medical officer of the royal<br>Austin constabulary so there you are he<br>stared there for years<br>all good<br>oh<br>that's good so what do you do then if<br>you're a training anti-surgery I liked<br>how years worked I loved<br>you know I loved looking in the air<br>cuddling in ears and helping people who<br>were deaf and in Belfast we had a lot of<br>deaf people because of the linen Mills<br>and the heavy industry that we had there<br>at the time<br>so um I decided right occupational<br>possessions what I'm going to be and I<br>went for a couple of interviews one with<br>London transport on a stink and Hot<br>August day strap hanging for an hour to<br>get the interviews and perform well I<br>thought thank God for that and the next<br>one that came up was with British call<br>in Stoughton Trent<br>when they asked me at the interview okay<br>what do you think do you think Audrey<br>you think audiometry has any place<br>and preventing noise and just hearing<br>what I said of course right and I got<br>right into it who wrote that job<br>lucky for me and the one thing about<br>occupational medicine is you can't do it<br>without being in the workplace<br>I used to terrorize the Personnel<br>managers of the main by trying to get<br>down the main<br>as often as I could and talking to<br>people<br>no we had an experimental cool<br>liquefaction plant at point of air<br>colliery because they were worried about<br>coal in those stairs the demise of coal<br>because you'll see it not far away so<br>the liquefying coal and there's these<br>things called dioxins and cool<br>liquefaction and in my course at the<br>University of Birmingham and my training<br>my registrar training<br>um<br>I did a talk<br>about toxicology<br>and this is what we did in those days do<br>you remember the overhead writing in the<br>overheads writing in the overhead slides<br>my goodness there was exposure standards<br>and here 200 mils of blood is what you<br>needed to do the test<br>which is good but it's fascinating stuff<br>dioxin<br>guinea pig the Pearl guinea pig is very<br>sensitive one microgram per kilogram<br>will kill 50 of guinea pigs<br>however the hamster is<br>resistant<br>this is going to be I think this is<br>going to be a recurrent theme<br>the hamster is highly resistant to<br>dioxins and and humans the half-life was<br>eight years and we'll<br>come back to that they were verifying<br>Microsoft Outlook up<br>I can fitter has it in from me<br>so I thought with us you know my talk<br>was relatively well received I thought<br>wrote me a letter<br>you can see what it says and the fear<br>we're not prepared to publish it in the<br>bmj we concluded that it was not<br>authoritarian authoritative enough to be<br>a leading article in the journal the<br>message was true to views none of the<br>readers on our panel felt that a clearer<br>idea of the subject after reading the<br>paper than before<br>I am very sorry to have to disappoint<br>you<br>that's one of the treasures I keep<br>I keep in a special foolordell through<br>your murders oh God here we go<br>one of the great things about in the<br>military is you learn to perform under<br>adversity<br>I'll probably get more adverse here<br>here's another thing that I've kept for<br>all these years<br>um<br>Lieutenant McBride can show signs of<br>incredible Salinas and occasions and<br>other times produce very good results<br>particularly when when lecturing he<br>plays a full part the regimental way of<br>life and that was in fact detected crime<br>right<br>but it was quite openly detected crime<br>because one of the guys Sean dries on<br>the previous Slide the booth were both<br>zombies circle of talents you know they<br>invited us with the regiment one five<br>six ulcer transport regimen invited us<br>to the um<br>a champion breakfast and the ordinary<br>colonel was there so the fair champagne<br>and then they gave us kibbers<br>and Drysdale purposely unsolded me I<br>farted and it landed in the honorary<br>Colonel thinking back you know we should<br>have taken a deep breath before I took<br>that<br>but then military life has always<br>perplexed me somewhere this this is<br>something where AI hasn't worked the<br>full the look a personal uniform talking<br>on the phone we didn't have phones then<br>of course not mobile phones<br>um they got the job because<br>um<br>the National Grid company had a problem<br>and again<br>um so the National Grid companies the<br>electrician electrical transmission<br>company in the UK and their 400 400 000<br>volt electrical product if you go to<br>work for them you've got to learn the<br>climb pylons I'm not particularly happy<br>with claiming pay loans but pylons I<br>claimed<br>knew you should have put it in the<br>desktop<br>something said to me put it in the<br>desktop but the problem was<br>um impulse noise<br>and there's a thing called the equal<br>energy hypothesis which I set out to try<br>and use<br>we'll just restart it and I'll<br>restart it malcosp in the meantime<br>um so the impulse noise thing which they<br>were trying to solve another few<br>technical things where did a few<br>technical things with an equation<br>that had been put together by burdens<br>and Robinson Professor D.W Robinson was<br>an engineer right<br>and they had<br>759 people<br>to form the basis of a cross-sectional<br>study<br>by which they deduced<br>how people went deaf<br>right and there was an equation<br>that they used with a tangential<br>function limit<br>on one half of the distribution came<br>from one place and there's another half<br>of the distribution came from another<br>place and they put the two distributions<br>together<br>that was great<br>and um<br>I was talking to my boss Malcolm<br>Harrington about this<br>and I said I'm a bit confused about how<br>you you know how how did they do this<br>when he said who do what<br>when I said professor professor D.W<br>Robinson or The Institute of science<br>vibration research and he said give him<br>a ring and they went<br>ring Professor Robin yeah I'm running<br>Professor Robinson so I rang Professor<br>Robinson<br>it was a great guy I talked to him about<br>three quarters of an hour and they said<br>how did how did you get that model to<br>fit because it's very elegant he said<br>are we we smoothed it out and threw some<br>of it out<br>you know the moral for that story is if<br>you're dealing what you think is Health<br>Data do ask a biostatistician<br>right that's it<br>is essential because he was an engineer<br>a physical an acoustic engineer and he's<br>a brilliant guy he volunteered for the<br>RAF Reserve volunteer Reserve ended up<br>in the Middle East<br>and he got imprisoned and in his<br>obituary it said that Douglas W Robinson<br>cried the scars of that experience<br>to his death<br>like all veterans he he just he would<br>not he wouldn't talk about it<br>like the father my father was a radio<br>operator and lancasters<br>and he went to Berlin towards the end of<br>the war never spoke about it<br>wouldn't say a word and lots of<br>Adventures are like that you've got to<br>get them talking about their experiences<br>and telling a story so then I went on to<br>do an Excel spreadsheet which used this<br>um use this algorithm which they<br>developed and I uh to this day I use it<br>to assess<br>whether a person's deafness is due to<br>noise or not<br>because ACC is taken to this<br>um<br>yeah that's a fender stratism really<br>that everything's due to the edge right<br>because as you edge<br>you get about<br>the effort<br>as you edge you know the bones and the<br>joints they get a bit<br>stiffer but what ACC forgets is that<br>with age goes to exposure<br>to whatever you're trying to deal with<br>and we call it cumulative exposure<br>and that cumulative exposure is a thing<br>that matters<br>when it comes to looking at disease and<br>for diseases of the spine for instance<br>there are ways of doing it that only the<br>what's called twin studies can get the<br>money to do because they've done MRIs<br>dollies of twins to show that there's no<br>effect basically but they're wrong<br>because forces acting in the spine can<br>cause<br>spinal damage<br>I think<br>it's all right so uh ah dioxins so then<br>when I came to otago I continued my PhD<br>because my supervisor was torching law<br>he died a couple of years it was a<br>really great guy but he was a crop PhD<br>supervisor and the only reason that I<br>managed to pass my PhD using the<br>algorithm going through everything in<br>detail was Sheila Williams<br>also a school teacher<br>who didn't let me away with anything and<br>I had my dad I had to be extremely clean<br>before I did anything with it<br>who won the European educational program<br>for for epidemiology<br>thank you<br>um<br>in which I learned that they<br>thank you in which I learned to do<br>something called logistic regression<br>which is a very dangerous thing to have<br>a doctor in charge of a thing called<br>logistic regression oh<br>this is this is this is what<br>this is what he I don't like the pastel<br>Hazard<br>um this is how you go there right this<br>is what deafness looks like and that is<br>the progression of deafness you get this<br>dip<br>terrible one no<br>I'll need to hurry up here<br>um<br>on the mechanism as a we still don't<br>know what causes it right because we<br>have this thing in the ear called the<br>cochlear and on top of the cochlea<br>there's hair cells in her hair so<br>there's another hair cells and noise<br>knocks them off somehow gradually and<br>it's the noise energy that does this<br>and using Firearms draws exactly the<br>and that's something to do with the<br>blood display to the cochlear because<br>there's a thing called vibration white<br>finger as well and it's nitric oxide and<br>the endothelium<br>on the nerve Shades and vibration white<br>finger<br>and I'm sure it's nitric oxide in the<br>year as well still there we go<br>right<br>um we've talked about that that's the<br>algorithm that they developed we use and<br>here we have two biostatisticians<br>enjoying the European educational<br>epidemiology course Sienna<br>which is good and you can ask Helen<br>harkham what it's like she's been I<br>recommend<br>um<br>Sienna<br>in the spring there we go<br>so yep<br>we're behind<br>we better move on to Veterans Health<br>shortly Calvin of course our home is<br>knew all about this<br>the problem involved imaginary numbers<br>11 10 30 12 and all those it's a little<br>confusing at first<br>and Hobbes had never gone to school of<br>course<br>um you can do fun things in an<br>occupational position as well this is<br>the bridge of the kaitake<br>now if um I'll show you<br>here's how it's driven now if you want<br>to find out what it's like to be in the<br>bridge of the kaitake is it safe for you<br>to stand up<br>could you is it safe here to stand up<br>nobody's<br>drunk and if you'd like to just slay<br>like falling over<br>a nice gentle emotion that's the bridge<br>what it's like to be on the bridge and<br>if we're all quiet and do it<br>there isn't any more noise than that<br>either so what the driver does is he<br>operates these two two levers as you can<br>see and the lever at the side to adjust<br>the speed and the pitch<br>and then<br>it used to be you did the bridge<br>Telegraph not in the war the driver does<br>it directly and here we have<br>and the engine control room<br>not going to run it's very noisy right<br>and they got me under measure whole body<br>vibration but the whole body vibration<br>wasn't enough to cause any damage<br>oh no<br>fiddle those levers in the right way and<br>fit the pictures appropriate storage<br>vibrating all over the place<br>and so on my final visit with the<br>kaitake the vibration will kind of saw<br>this<br>we talk about DBA but there's a thing<br>called DBZ<br>and when you looked at the I thought oh<br>look at the DBZ and the noise was about<br>83 32 or 83 decibels which is nothing<br>but DBZ was 105.<br>and it's that low frequency would say<br>noise I think is causing the problem<br>here we have right the dioxin problem I<br>eventually did get published after I got<br>to know a bit more about dioxins right<br>dioxins directly Plymouth was a project<br>I really enjoyed because involved with<br>the plant<br>and I got involved with the public and I<br>got involved with the Action Group up<br>there<br>and talk to them all right the Action<br>Group<br>very angry to start off but after two<br>and a half to three hours they<br>eventually settled down<br>and said um yeah well you know it's okay<br>we'll believe what you find though but<br>back then it was much different<br>um it was another equation<br>excellent stuff but that way we could<br>work out<br>um what everybody in this study had by<br>the way of dioxin in their blood at the<br>time and work back<br>their exposures and did the<br>epidemiological study<br>on the basic dose response thing is to<br>look at you know very low low medium and<br>high levels of dioxin in the blood and<br>there was really nothing in it even when<br>we did the deuce<br>we've estimated the regression curve for<br>it<br>the other thing we did a group of us was<br>mapura where they decided to build a<br>remediation plant for a chemical plant<br>in the middle of a residential area with<br>a big drum rotating drum and they hit it<br>up to high temperatures<br>and the residents saw this coming out of<br>the stack it was only steam of course<br>but<br>they were worried about this thing so we<br>got the contract<br>which is doing good no cream at all in<br>the spillway right would it say to be do<br>good listen to sheet of results you get<br>where you ask for a deoxen test and send<br>off your 200 mL of blood<br>um let's dioxin here but you get down<br>pentafioran<br>dioxins all kinds of stuff and I<br>actually start doing everybody in the<br>study had their blood tested everybody<br>came back<br>and wanted the results we went through<br>them one by one like this and eventually<br>everybody was quite sure whether or not<br>they considered there was a hazard or<br>was not we did the same at New Plymouth<br>gave everybody back the results and I<br>think 28 people out of the 150 of the<br>plant came in for the results<br>and map where everyone all the people<br>and all the people in Australia and all<br>the controls came in right veterans<br>health<br>um<br>we had our veterans Health theme going a<br>while ago and John was involved in that<br>brand Cox was involved in that bran and<br>John and I<br>um have been working in Daryl Tong I've<br>been working on the health of Vietnam<br>veterans<br>um<br>so there's a number of things we had to<br>do we actually did get eventually a PhD<br>Michael and Harris who's looking at how<br>tertiary education military identity and<br>mental well-being<br>can work for KB veterans<br>and intend to submit Brian and I a major<br>project for funding by Vans a cohort of<br>all veterans you know Veterans Affairs<br>says they can't don't have any data but<br>they do we have it brown Hazard actually<br>I've been interviewed by this there were<br>special and the<br>Mr Smith<br>again who came to see me to make sure<br>that um the data was being held securely<br>under the official Secrets act who have<br>been through that<br>I've had a disciplinary interview with a<br>senior officer but she wasn't senior she<br>wouldn't pay any attention so that's<br>good<br>um<br>2010-2011 I volunteered to do a year at<br>Burnham and volunteered Dell to come<br>with me<br>on the 4th of September there was<br>Darfield earthquake 19th November Pike<br>River and then 22nd of February the<br>Christchurch earthquake<br>which includes Christchurch basically<br>we were a lot more school I was studying<br>in a parking care September airport and<br>Dell was driving on isron Drive outside<br>the forest Service headquarters and the<br>air was blue<br>with what was happening or happening<br>because it was still shaking right so<br>um<br>this was the first response everything<br>was over by the next day<br>we looked at fire piece and ambulance<br>providers of essential Services utility<br>workers Marty wardens Red Cross and<br>teachers the S line surveyed with three<br>follow-ups right so sometime after their<br>earthquake but we were looking at ptisd<br>and what protected against PTSD in this<br>group<br>so<br>um we had psychological measures the<br>important ones were the social provision<br>scale really and a measure to stress the<br>ghg 228<br>and after an earthquake you can't have<br>this thing called<br>post-traumatic growth<br>most veterans do well through their<br>experience some do badly the ones that<br>have PTSD do badly but we looked at this<br>for these groups police ambulance<br>teachers and non-traditional<br>firefighters<br>and we found two groups of PTSD right<br>two trajectories of PTSD PTSD new PTSD<br>the prevalence 37 24 and 24 after the<br>earthquake now these were just symptoms<br>of PTSD it wasn't clinical PTSD<br>what we found was that yeah okay an<br>eight percent increase with the impact<br>of events that had happened I'm sorry<br>about the odds ratio the 17 percent<br>increase in PTSD<br>for social support<br>which intrigued us<br>um and other psychological measures you<br>know you can you can imagine what denial<br>disengagement venting and humor so<br>everything over one their PTSD has<br>increased anything under<br>um ptsds decreased and 0.85 but<br>fortunately not significant but humor<br>seemed to<br>humor seemed to help and it was probably<br>black humor and there's nothing wrong<br>with that really<br>um so the best model that was the best<br>model for social support<br>um<br>nope<br>this is going backwards very quickly<br>which is good<br>so it seemed counter-insuratory that<br>social support didn't seem to help these<br>people after the earthquake<br>um on military veterans this is a yes<br>because we couldn't get the military to<br>participate in this study they were too<br>slow it was really it was brilliant I<br>um so what two choices keep calm and<br>carry on or panic and free good<br>um<br>there we go<br>um so just a little bit about<br>spirituality Richard we did a study of<br>chaplains and spirituality and that the<br>chaplains are the best people in the<br>world<br>wonderful people for calming the spirit<br>making sure your crime remains<br>undetected but there's got to be some<br>better help than going to the Padre for<br>cup of tea and a bun so we eventually<br>did get money to look at the physical<br>health of contemporary ANZ DF veterans<br>from the veterans Health advisory panel<br>which has about three million dollars in<br>trust the trust hasn't been making much<br>money recently so there haven't been<br>funding much but at least it's there<br>right I wasn't the veterans Healthcare<br>panel advisory panel but I got chucked<br>off at I don't know why<br>um Brian Cox oh you were on as well<br>Brown you got choked off too no oh you<br>stared<br>oh God right so um<br>the Europe World visual analog scale how<br>well do you feel today and it's not a<br>sideways scale it's not been down scale<br>right worst Health you can imagine at<br>the bottom of the best health you can<br>imagine at the top<br>and we looked at<br>oh<br>prove you're not true oh<br>yes right okay so the things in the left<br>hand side are categorical variables so<br>sex doesn't matter ethnicity didn't<br>appear to matter either<br>um so the Maori people in the Defense<br>Force when they're serving are no less<br>worse off if you're deployed it actually<br>made you feel better<br>trauma made it worse<br>over in here on the right hand side of<br>psychological flexibility helped a<br>little now this is a continuous variable<br>so that's important and sleep was the<br>single biggest thing indicator that a<br>veteran was not<br>that a veteran was good so we were<br>searching<br>during my time at Burnham we had people<br>leaving lots of people leaving and I<br>couldn't find anywhere for them to go to<br>get help they were walking out the<br>getting<br>and I spent my time trying to get them a<br>doctor or a psychologist in the town to<br>which they were going and I thought this<br>isn't good enough what we've got to do<br>is identify risk factors early and sleep<br>is one of those things ask a couple of<br>simple questions instead of filling out<br>silly bloody forms that don't not<br>informative<br>and we can get help for those veterans<br>and I'll come on how they're getting<br>help in a bit and they need help because<br>of this<br>veterans compared to New Zealand<br>population it's more significant problem<br>for Mobility self-care usual activities<br>and piano discomfort the highest level<br>being for pain and discomfort<br>I know why this is lower limb hip and<br>back injuries from load from jumping off<br>vehicles and all the rest of those good<br>things<br>of veterans<br>the same joint problems they're also<br>worried about neoplasms but they're<br>mostly skin cancers going along with the<br>skin conditions here because the Navy<br>doors get a lot of sun exposure<br>Gulf War syndrome<br>as the other thing we thought we'd look<br>at<br>because Sean Drysdale he went to the<br>Gulf<br>on route back to me about what<br>conditions were like<br>um it was a it was the battle to end all<br>battles the mother of all battles and it<br>just sort of fizzled out in the end<br>thankful thank God for that<br>because we in the transport regiment<br>we're all packed ready to go and we<br>didn't have to go that was okay possible<br>causes they looked at all kinds of<br>things like vaccinations like the fumes<br>from the oil fires what else depleted<br>uranium from Munitions another problem<br>in the Balkans right and they had<br>started a look at psychological distress<br>so what we did<br>was<br>with the previous study that we'd done<br>we included a multi-system illness<br>questionnaire<br>and this is what Claire Cameron who<br>struggled with this a bit because it's a<br>complex thing hidden for us even for a<br>biostatistician and we got three groups<br>of symptoms which we labeled<br>arthroneuromuscular cognitive and<br>psychophysiological<br>joint pain<br>muscle aches and pains unrefreshing<br>sleep forgetfulness sleeping<br>difficulties avoiding doing things or<br>situation fatigue and distressing dims<br>and a discriminant function showed that<br>those were<br>predictive of PSD predicted<br>more symptoms and the warlion thing<br>about the whole thing is that<br>um an Australian<br>in the Australian Navy<br>and yeah and the Australian Navy they<br>showed that the more symptoms and the<br>more severe they were eventually turned<br>into real real disease<br>so that was a big problem<br>um transitions important right<br>and that strange good idea a bit of a<br>mess so I'll just bring it up this was<br>this was I like do you like mind maps<br>I've always loved mind maps I do very<br>untidy main Maps but a veteran has a<br>pre-service<br>uh background and then during service<br>his career his or her career develops<br>sometimes they get leadership potential<br>I don't know if in the Infantry<br>the top the top soldiers become<br>Travelers they can become Scouts and<br>they become snipers right so their<br>qualification is tracking people down<br>and making sure they don't live too long<br>which is a<br>an area that's not highly sought in<br>civilian life<br>however what we need to do is make sure<br>that the leadership potential of these<br>people is recognized it's not<br>necessarily the military skills because<br>the military person thinks difficult<br>differently so these are positive Career<br>Development negative<br>right adverse health effects injury<br>physical psychological and moral injury<br>um and I haven't got a lot of time left<br>to talk a bit more injury but moral<br>injury is awfully important<br>um<br>just last we forgot the 10 people that<br>have been killed<br>in Afghanistan<br>um<br>I was on tour anyway yeah I had just<br>left so my colleagues were having to<br>deal with fall out of that right the<br>military<br>um yes it's regimental yes it's<br>hierarchical<br>but Mission commands the important thing<br>about that<br>because in the military it comes down<br>from the top and you're told what to do<br>but not exactly how to do it so you've<br>got a lot of latitude in what you do and<br>here are a um here are soldiers and<br>parade the root look as if they're<br>enjoying themselves<br>but that's fine they just got their<br>serious faces on they really are<br>enjoying enjoying this<br>flicker of a smile out there and parade<br>can bring during the wrath of God upon<br>one<br>so one hostel is serious I'm not too<br>serious not too angry but that's all<br>fine<br>um<br>yes this is this possibly could<br>be considered morally wrong under some<br>circumstances<br>now an important thing we did was this<br>study of loneliness right so it looks<br>complicated but isolation is the most<br>important thing for a veteran not just<br>physical isolation living out on the<br>west coast somewhere but<br>isolate social isolation<br>and individual factors are experiential<br>a thing called experiential loneliness<br>nobody's experienced the same thing that<br>you have<br>and they don't have people that they can<br>talk to if they have if the<br>connectedness if they've got social<br>support of the right kind from somebody<br>understands what they're talking about<br>that is all a huge help ours as veteran<br>support so<br>um here's just some of the quotes<br>that came out of that it was a medical<br>student study<br>you don't want to know clinical sake<br>said don't tell her because you're going<br>to do a traumatizer and the point that<br>you're supposed to be on a Saturday was<br>involved in this and then she changed<br>overnight sexual healer how to end<br>things goes all the way to control<br>and comments about<br>knees disability<br>and this is all the same participant<br>this person was yeah<br>it was very telling and I hit the wall<br>mid last year and Veterans Affairs<br>couldn't find anyone for me to see no<br>one that sent me to he said I knew<br>nothing but Mildred PTSD but he wants to<br>talk to I said look it's not going to<br>work but I need help so we'll go along<br>after 20 minutes to go and peel I had no<br>idea what to say or do<br>no<br>um I swallow about storytelling right if<br>you can get veterans to tell their story<br>they'll bring things out because they're<br>usually stuck with something somewhere<br>got this really brilliant study he tore<br>tomato law the many resting places of<br>course was it matarangi Maori framework<br>to it for storytelling a framework to it<br>and a store and a framework<br>matarangi Maori framework to deconstruct<br>those stories and find out what's the<br>what's what's going on here<br>and the stories<br>um we've been listening to are really<br>helped veterans to find and most of<br>these I think would it be right to Paula<br>they're usually stuck somewhere stuck<br>with something<br>um Something's Happened to him and it's<br>just finding out what that thing is and<br>getting to deal with it or helping them<br>to deal with it for goodness sakes<br>um a pathway so what were the future a<br>pathway to care for New Zealand veterans<br>with pain and distress it was an idea of<br>Mark compen an xrsa Support Services<br>monitor<br>who is working for MSD and I were no<br>wishes he was back with the irsa with<br>the RSA Battlefield lucky puncture<br>developed in the U.S military uh<br>developed by the U.S Air Force a colonel<br>in the U.S Air Force along with veteran<br>ready training for practitioners which<br>is not a difficult thing to do<br>yes<br>making getting people to become there's<br>a short training course that you can do<br>which teaches you a wee bit about the<br>military<br>so that there's practitioners who want<br>to see<br>veterans and are willing to help them<br>and a thing called focused action and<br>commitment therapy which it's a veteran<br>within a couple of sessions if it<br>doesn't work within a couple of sessions<br>it's too complex to talk about the thing<br>where they're stopping<br>to get them to deal with it sometimes<br>it's about going out<br>um<br>friends and activities right and you<br>just get them to work a wee bit more<br>every day at undergoing undertaking<br>activity<br>but acupuncture in New Zealand is now on<br>board with us so we have a nationwide<br>study going we've only got 50 veterans<br>in it so far we'll see where it goes but<br>um<br>it looks to be good so the next thing we<br>need to do is to finish the stories<br>which Deport our we're well ahead at the<br>moment<br>which we're going to do get those online<br>so that veterans can say it's all right<br>to tell them a story I can't talk and<br>there's someone I can go to who's going<br>to actually listen to me with the ear of<br>enlightenment<br>and we're going to find out the other<br>thing why social support<br>why social support doesn't help<br>we suspect it's<br>statistically speaking it has<br>coloniality with distress which is what<br>the problem is<br>um the next thing that we need to do<br>probably is some structural equation<br>modeling to identify word of stress and<br>where social support lies and not<br>um and that Pathways or be trying to<br>recruit another biostatistician very<br>soon Claire it's all right you're off<br>that<br>um<br>yeah<br>so this is what an rip looks like a<br>regiment LED post and Afghanistan<br>there's a doctor<br>there's a nursing officer and there's a<br>senior medic right and one two three<br>four five not all there Junior medics<br>but it was a group like this that had to<br>deal with<br>um<br>all those casual days that happened all<br>at once and the person I handed over to<br>Kit boys and dear foot or footy did a<br>great job establishing a casually<br>clearing post and getting them out<br>and I'm saving a lot of people who were<br>ahead including Afghan interpreters and<br>Afghan Liberty police<br>okay<br>so I think my time is the time up<br>good<br>um thank you all so much for coming<br>tonight and um<br>um yeah<br>um we don't usually do questions do we<br>no<br>I have to come back<br>so I'm the head of the Department of<br>preventive and social medicine and it's<br>my role to thank David for his lecture<br>tonight and if I think you'll agree with<br>me it was really wide-ranging<br>fascinating entertaining<br>and very enjoyable lecture I do have a<br>confession to make

you haven't told us much about<br>your time in East Timor or<br>um even much about your time in<br>Afghanistan and also all the work you've<br>done to help Occupational Medicine<br>within New Zealand and within Britain<br>and improve the workplace well-being and<br>health of of uh new zealanders and<br>people elsewhere in the world I also<br>want to thank you personally for what<br>you've done for workplace well-being in<br>our department because having an<br>enthusiastic good humid and nice person<br>like you certainly improves our<br>well-being at work<br>so thank you David<br>for you thank
