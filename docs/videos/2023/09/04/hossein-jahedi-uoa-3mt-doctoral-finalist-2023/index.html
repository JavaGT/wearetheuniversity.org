font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>a few years ago my grandmother passed<br>away from pancreatic cancer three months<br>after she was diagnosed<br>her blood biomarker for early detection<br>of pancreatic cancer was not elevated<br>until it was too late and the stage four<br>pancreatic cancer patient there was no<br>treatment options available<br>there was a really hard and sad three<br>months for my family and I know I do not<br>wish that on anyone<br>but it is stories like this and there<br>are many of them that has made<br>pancreatic cancer notorious as the<br>silent killer of Kansas and despite the<br>recent advancements in cancer therapy<br>like immunotherapy and targeted therapy<br>the death rate for pancreatic cancer has<br>not improved for the past two decades<br>the question is why<br>I think one main reason is that the<br>models we used to study pancreatic<br>cancer outside the human body are not<br>ideal for that purpose when we talk<br>about cancers even as scientists it is<br>easy to Tunnel Vision on cancer cells<br>only but cancers are more than just<br>cancer cells there are immune cells<br>there are fibroblasts there's<br>extracellular Matrix and this non-cancel<br>component forms up to 80 percent of<br>pancreatic cancers yet the models we use<br>to study the disease do not take that<br>into consideration so in my research I<br>did two things to try and change that<br>I grew cancer cells in three dimension<br>these are called tumor spheroids these<br>spheroids are as easy replicable and<br>affordable to grow as the conventional<br>two-dimensional methods of cell culture<br>with added features that make some<br>resemble pancreatic cancer more like<br>extra production of external Matrix next<br>I asked what is a unique feature of<br>pancreatic cancer and an answer was<br>hyaluronic acid yes it's that thing that<br>you add to your skin to moisturize and<br>no no no no you're not going to get<br>cancer by doing that in pancreatic<br>cancer is produced in large quantities<br>compared to normal pancreas and even<br>other cancers<br>it has this ability to absorb water to<br>itself it collapses the blood vessels<br>that go into the tumor and then prevents<br>chemotherapy from killing cancer cells<br>adding hyaluronic acid to my<br>three-dimensional tumors spheroids made<br>them resemble pancreatic cancer even<br>more now this is just a couple of things<br>that I've done to create better models<br>for pancreatic cancer in future we hope<br>to add other cell types like fibroblasts<br>into these tumors spheroids with the<br>hopes that in future it can translate<br>into better treatment and diagnosis<br>options for patients with pancreatic<br>cancer<br>for patients like my grandmother thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
