hosking I'm the dean of<br>science here at the University of<br>Auckland waipapa tamatarawa it's my very<br>great pleasure to welcome you both to<br>the university and to the inaugural<br>lecturer of Professor Giovanni rossello<br>Giovanni is Sicilian so when he offered<br>us the opportunity to promote him to<br>Professor we could hardly refuse<br>he works on the area of cyber security<br>which involves keeping us safe from the<br>wolves on the internet which has moved<br>from a nice to have in terms of<br>Information Systems infrastructure to an<br>essential for any organization or<br>individual witnessed a very high profile<br>successful cyber attacks that have been<br>made in recent times within New Zealand<br>and the very high reputational<br>operational and social damage that I've<br>created<br>Giovanni's research interests Encompass<br>a wide range of areas within cyber<br>security it's particularly focused on<br>human centered cyber security<br>policy-based security systems privacy<br>and confidentially confidentiality in<br>cloud computing smartphone security and<br>Giovanni serves as director of the<br>mb-funded cyber security research<br>program and is founding co-director of<br>the cyber security Foundry the first<br>multi-disciplinary center for cyber<br>security in New Zealand focusing on<br>Bridging the Gap between industry and<br>Academia<br>it's also served as the CEO of a startup<br>addressing security concerns in the<br>smart phone market<br>demonstrating his commitment to<br>practical applications of his research<br>Giovanni has an MSC from the University<br>of Catania in Italy and a PhD from<br>Eindhoven<br>he did a postdoc at Imperial College and<br>was a senior researcher at create net a<br>cyber security Research Center in trento<br>before he was lured here to Auckland in<br>2012.<br>as well as being an excellent researcher<br>and teacher Giovanni is also head of<br>computer science which has the largest<br>student enrollment of any school within<br>the faculty<br>his pitch to the school for the role<br>included the memorable statement that I<br>am Sicilian I have lava in my blood<br>did I say that you did<br>I'm not sure what to expect tonight but<br>I'm sure that it will be given with<br>foreign<br>thank you very much for the nice word<br>introduction I mean it's a bit ironic<br>that you know to keep you safe you need<br>a sicilian but I think that's what you<br>got I assume<br>so if you see us running in the<br>direction that's where we're going going<br>out<br>yeah<br>Okay so<br>I had to say that was really difficult<br>for me to prepare these uh these slides<br>I really<br>didn't know what to put what to put<br>there and I would like basically to<br>steal a quote from cyber security<br>research no cyber security expert<br>actually not a researcher so it is a<br>person we're talking with we organize an<br>event the last year I think Steven was<br>was there as well<br>and basically this person said you know<br>working in cyber security in New Zealand<br>is like being plumber you can make a lot<br>of money but you need to dig for a lot<br>of ship every day it didn't say ship<br>well of course I think you can guess<br>what what he said and then I think you<br>move to Australia<br>so basically I could stop this lecture<br>here I mean this will be the shortest I<br>think inaugural lecture<br>but given that you have made the effort<br>to coming along and you have also we<br>paid for the wine I think will be good<br>that you let me elaborate a bit more<br>maybe for the next hour also<br>you know we operate and we work we live<br>in a very complex complex landscape<br>right and when we talk about all the<br>digital systems around us<br>we're not dealing with the small systems<br>anymore<br>you know we like to design<br>something that is a very simple and<br>functional and then through time we<br>increase the complexity and the more you<br>increase the complexity basically<br>the more vulnerable that your system<br>might became or more you know difficult<br>to maintain<br>I'm basically coming from Sicily so<br>there is a lot of Greek implants there<br>so you might guess where this is coming<br>from so but this is what humans do right<br>we like to you know start from a kind of<br>a Baseline and they try to make things<br>more interesting and complex<br>so and also like the kind of um device<br>that nowadays we use are not simple<br>anymore so<br>space shuttle so to bring people in<br>orbit and back safely 400 000 line of<br>code and this in 27. sorry in 887 I<br>don't even want to come anymore 87.<br>20 years later when we got to the first<br>iPhone 10 millions of line of code so<br>huge increase 25 times more code which<br>means more complexity more difficult to<br>maintain more vulnerabilities and more<br>job for me won't work for me and if you<br>are basically kind of wondering how many<br>line of code your smart fridges around<br>100<br>000 and you can basically throw a smart<br>fridge you can<br>also run attacks so Samsung Smart fridge<br>basically was used for launching a<br>denial service attack so everything<br>around you actually can be used against<br>it so it's uh as long as a running<br>software or code and is attached or<br>connected to the internet can be<br>so you know<br>I'm an academic so I like the<br>definitions I try shoot and so you know<br>I would like to Define kind of in a<br>short way what cyber security is because<br>otherwise going ahead it is a discussion<br>will make no sense and as you do what<br>you do you ask a basically chat CBT what<br>cyber security is<br>and this I hope this is the correct<br>answer I think it still makes sense<br>although people are saying is getting<br>stupid or stupider why is it basically<br>handling more question from us anyway so<br>cyber security basically is a kind of a<br>set of activities<br>they try to protect let's say a computer<br>system uh networks software any kind of<br>digital assets you might have and the<br>protection is against digital attacks<br>right so we're not thinking about<br>attacks like you know stealing your<br>laptop on the physical side unauthorized<br>access for instance or damage or test<br>that you can perpetrate through a<br>digital digital way plus I mean so you<br>know you have to have some kind of goal<br>so what you try to achieve here so you<br>know the goal is for for cyber security<br>is basically try to make sure that you<br>have a confidentiality<br>um Integrity availability they also give<br>a mechanism before authenticating the<br>authorizing your users because for this<br>then you can control what they can do<br>you have also to maintain some kind of<br>no reputation systems because you want<br>to make sure that if someone does<br>something then<br>you know they cannot say oh it wasn't on<br>me you know HR loves these actually but<br>I will love this kind of tools<br>resilience security awareness that you<br>want to train your people and if this is<br>not enough<br>you have also to be aware about<br>renewable memorabilities that are in<br>your system threats<br>they also be response ready I mean if<br>something happens you know what what is<br>your plan what you're gonna do right<br>you're gonna plug the you know your<br>server from from the power you're gonna<br>shut down if you're under attack or<br>you're going to do some kind of logging<br>or not so you need to have a plan so I'm<br>already tired you know exhausted by<br>telling all these activities right but<br>the thing is the in for cyber security<br>you need to maintain all of these<br>24-hour<br>a day seven days a week 300<br>65 days<br>I'm completely out of this place I mean<br>um a year right so basically it's a<br>continuous process you cannot stop it's<br>not like being a soft engineer and I'm<br>gonna basically harm myself to Engineers<br>tonight because that's what I do so you<br>know you're not like somebody does like<br>eight to five close the door go home and<br>who cares right so you have to be always<br>there it's always be<br>you know fireplace emerging these<br>Services you have to be always available<br>and ready to because something can go<br>wrong basically the bad guys never sleep<br>yo that's the approach<br>okay so it's it's like a you know as I<br>said exhausting and<br>it's uh continuous investment so you<br>have to invest some tools so it's not<br>like buy your latest because in the<br>months it's you know software too<br>whatever it's gonna be replaced by<br>something better so you need to keep<br>investing on that and you need also to<br>keep investing in people right because<br>people are gonna be your key<br>investment actually because it's where<br>you are gonna you know they need to use<br>the tools boss understand the<br>organization and if they leave they're<br>gonna live with them a lot of knowledge<br>and replacing them it's it's very<br>difficult if not impossible sometimes<br>so<br>when you think about that I mean it's<br>basically a growing cost especially if<br>you are an organization it's it's always<br>going that way so you have to spend more<br>and more and more mandating a kind of a<br>stable state is very very difficult<br>okay so it's expensive it's very<br>difficult no you know you need to have a<br>special specialized knowledge and<br>um costs a lot of money<br>and you know on top of all of these it's<br>not a real feature when was the last<br>time that you bought a device or piece<br>of software just because it was the most<br>secure than anything else or anything<br>out there or anything of the other<br>option that were available<br>yeah so<br>that's one of the main probably selling<br>so unless the best because we're talking<br>about you know specialized kind of tools<br>or software right I mean firewall or any<br>other kind of<br>you know identity management or whatever<br>like tools that are specialized for<br>doing cyber security organization except<br>for that I mean all the rest which is a<br>very small portion all the rest is um<br>you know you look for how look the look<br>and feel right I mean and why not<br>so and even if you one you are one of<br>those a few people that are basically<br>you know looking for you know a secure<br>feature in the whatever you're gonna buy<br>I mean your smartphone your phone or<br>your smartwatch you know measuring cyber<br>security is difficult it's difficult<br>because it's not a finite quantity it<br>evolves all the time it's more like a<br>sliding window to consider plus you need<br>to be an expert I mean you're gonna get<br>you're gonna ask Apple to give the<br>software of the operating system I'm<br>gonna check line by line yeah good luck<br>doing the 10 millions of a line right so<br>oh you have to rely on someone else or<br>you have to rely until basically<br>something went wrong and they said oh<br>I'm not going to use that stuff anymore<br>I'm not going to buy because something<br>went wrong with that so it's very very<br>difficult to kind of um<br>to deal with the cyber security in<br>general<br>and then again so the soft Engineers so<br>usually cyber security is considered as<br>a kind of enough after thought something<br>that you can add later on right so for<br>the moment let's try to you know<br>Implement as quickly as possible and<br>release in case we can patch it later<br>right and that's where the problem<br>happens right so usually you know it's<br>obtained people you know think that is<br>someone has problem maybe cyber security<br>expert problem to fix but when it gets<br>to us it's already too late and if I<br>look I was talking with some of the<br>experts here if we look at soft<br>Engineering in this University for<br>instance<br>you know students get to learn that you<br>know they need to build their software<br>that to be cyber security ready but they<br>don't know what you know how to kind of<br>look for vulnerability test for it so<br>again it's gonna be third parties doing<br>that or someone else and at the end of<br>the day if all of that basically does<br>not fly away just to blame the user it's<br>just a bloody user that doesn't know how<br>to use my system<br>I'll try not to swear but I swear a lot<br>guys so in case<br>don't listen<br>okay so blame the user it's kind of<br>something that it would be a theme that<br>I mean I was a system guy or an actual<br>sorry sorry I'm cyber security system<br>side of things and my Approach always<br>was the the fault you know blame the<br>user they don't know how what they're<br>doing how they're doing it and I will<br>elaborate a bit more on that later on<br>good<br>so now cyber security in aoteroa<br>so you know coming back to that what<br>that we we said it's so true man I mean<br>you can really make a lot of money<br>but and I don't know why I'm here but<br>anyway so I just kind of think about it<br>anyway<br>um<br>so<br>I mean this is more country we have a<br>very limited resource and this is<br>something that I keep hammering over and<br>over and talking with the people so we<br>need to be really kind of smart in the<br>way we deploy our resources we need to<br>try to avoid to replicate to do you know<br>several several group of people they<br>don't talk each other do the same thing<br>over and over<br>plus if you look at the scale of like<br>companies in New Zealand I mean 97 the<br>smes less than 20 people do you think<br>that these kind of organizations have<br>the um and the resource and the time to<br>invest in cyber security as you need to<br>do it's so almost impossible right<br>so resources are premium here and<br>reputation is key once an organization<br>especially an SME gets hit by a Cyber<br>attack I mean you have something a<br>chance of coming back of 30 most of them<br>they don't come back it's not only a<br>financial loss or problem it's also<br>reputation recovering your reputation<br>especially when you are in SM Nemo and<br>you get stuck up or medium organization<br>mode is it's it's almost impossible it's<br>a huge task because that's where you've<br>spent all your resources to try to build<br>and then once Crusher because the subway<br>subway security getting back almost<br>impossible so you need to be careful by<br>you you know what what you are doing<br>there<br>and then we have also some kind of<br>unique aspect that you know I've been<br>living here by kind of operating more in<br>these in this in this in this space and<br>is around our indigenous people Maori<br>Maori people in particular I would say<br>so<br>when you look at standards and tools<br>foreign there is a lot out there but<br>most<br>if not all of them are dealing with a<br>large Market they don't care about<br>minorities I mean because you know it's<br>it's again economy of scale so<br>when we talk about like I mean I've<br>learned that when you talk about the<br>data especially for a kind of a Maori<br>organization they deal with it in a<br>different way than a western kind of<br>organization so confidentiality of<br>privacy has a different meaning<br>so when you want to approach or you want<br>to work in this space with them is you<br>know you have to kind of have a proper<br>parameters in place I'm gonna say that<br>you know the solution that are there<br>cannot be customized to deal with this<br>but nobody does that unless they do by<br>themselves which again is a lot of way<br>for them to put in this in this space<br>plus there is a bit of a lack of trust<br>which I do I don't blame so you know<br>trust is someone to bring stuff in you<br>know it's your house you have to be<br>careful who you're bringing in and what<br>you bring in<br>and you know it's also important to<br>boost diversity because not only it's a<br>different way of thinking but again it's<br>it's bringing or building their own<br>capacity as well because at the end of<br>expert and<br>you know they they say this all the time<br>you know what works for Maori works for<br>other in this case is a is true it's<br>very very true so it could work for<br>and at the end of the day I mean<br>assuming that you know you invest in<br>tools you invest in in the humans in<br>your in your people and you have um<br>you know everything in order ideally<br>right so you have all the best<br>technology you can block all kind of<br>threats coming uh through the network<br>and<br>um they are trying to find one network<br>because or not it might not be enough<br>and the main issue is because of fishing<br>and I would try to elaborate a bit more<br>why fishing is kind of a different<br>issue than any other kind of cyber cyber<br>attacks<br>Okay so<br>that's where things get a bit more<br>interesting and they can relax or maybe<br>not<br>okay so this is a kind of a typical<br>example I mean I apologize to my score<br>because I think you've seen this before<br>but<br>this is kind of a typical example of a<br>phishing email right and when I say<br>typical assemble is because there are<br>some kind of ins that basically are<br>telling you that can can be fishy<br>so<br>can you guys see no so for instance that<br>is the sender address that basically<br>look like a semi legit but it might be<br>not things are coming from a company<br>that you have never heard before and<br>sims.com yeah pretty good<br>there is a general salutation like the<br>customer the user so it's not<br>specifically to David the John Cassandra<br>so it's kind of a bit General and then<br>if you read the text if the body of the<br>email<br>basically try to push the user to do<br>something otherwise something bad can<br>happen to you or something that you care<br>about<br>so assume that people have received<br>emails like this<br>have you not yeah yes yes yes and we<br>have a clicking from an email like this<br>I know person that has done that<br>so I mean and especially because you<br>know it looks like a um something on<br>who's gonna do that but depending when<br>it can happen and I'm trying to kind of<br>again you can explain a bit more on this<br>so<br>basically I mean the definition of<br>fishing this time without chat CPT is<br>that basically social engineering type<br>of attack where the attackers are trying<br>to leverage human feelings like<br>curiosity fear in order to ask in order<br>to kind of load them to perform an<br>action sometimes it's just replying the<br>email is enough right they can collect<br>some intelligence about the organization<br>sometimes they ask you to download<br>something an attachment and sometimes<br>they ask you to click a link so these<br>are the main things they ask you to do<br>some you have to perform something for<br>them and usually the last two that you<br>know downloading something or clicking<br>links is a vector for bringing in<br>another thread<br>like I've ransomware for instance<br>so it's growing and the growing is<br>exponential it's costing us a lot I mean<br>it's a kind of a huge amount of money<br>that is you know related to fishing plus<br>is getting more and more sophisticated I<br>mean with the chat GPT we are getting<br>everybody I think I mean it's getting<br>more efficient you know replying emails<br>for instance our students are getting a<br>A plus right I mean they're all super<br>smart now<br>also the attackers basically you know<br>they are having a ball with strategypt<br>and there are two ways in which you can<br>use strategy GPT for uh generating<br>phishing emails one you can have a huge<br>scale and have like emails that look<br>legit because no mistakes in um there<br>are no typos so it's much more<br>professional craft right and you can go<br>also by jumping across a different<br>language you have a bigger type of uh<br>audience kind of to to connect to right<br>but there is another aspect as well that<br>there is basically targeting specific<br>individual and organization usually go<br>for the big fish like uh you know CEO<br>and<br>lctos like the the people that have like<br>a bigger they can make bigger decisions<br>we call this a kind of um<br>spear fishing or whaling depending you<br>know how you want to look at it<br>and it requires a lot of effort you know<br>fishing basically works because you can<br>generate 150 millions of email per day<br>because you can spam everybody but when<br>you want to go targeting specific<br>individual you have to do a lot of<br>intelligence kind of intelligence<br>beforehand you have to look for<br>information there or not now you don't<br>need to do that because<br>a smart agent can do this for you and<br>you can do again at scale right so you<br>can say okay look for all the tops I<br>mean top 500 companies CEO and give me a<br>kind of small report and then from that<br>you can even generate emails that will<br>go after them so again scale is kind of<br>and you know one of the approaches that<br>we have here in New Zealand that really<br>kind of uh makes me a bit uneasy<br>sometimes is that you know we are far<br>away who cares about New Zealand you<br>know everything is so far from us why<br>they should come for for us yeah sure I<br>mean like at the waikato there should be<br>attack fishing attack then bringing that<br>you brought in basically uh ransomware<br>that locked all the I.T infrastructure<br>demonstrate that we are a click away<br>from anything out there so bad actors<br>can come to us it is not the only attack<br>that we have seen the other attack major<br>attack was the one for the stock<br>exchange servers that basically was<br>locked on for a while<br>and that was a DDOS type of attack so<br>different kind of attacks but still I<br>mean something that um<br>um can reach us anytime and there are<br>many attacks happening as I said once<br>you connect your system to the network a<br>taxi will come<br>so this one in particular demonstrate<br>another thing that is quite important<br>and basically you know Cyber attack a<br>digital attack is not just oh my phone<br>gets locked or I lost my image or I<br>myself I cannot send emails these kind<br>of attacks can have effect on real<br>people in real life<br>and that's the most kind of a dramatic<br>part of it so this is in hospital<br>imagine for instance in getting it<br>eating like um<br>a power plant for instance or our great<br>infrastructure I mean being during<br>summer<br>without any power for instance or even<br>like a winter I mean I know that uh that<br>world so it's a huge huge huge problem<br>right so everything is basically running<br>software and everything is connected<br>which means that basically can be<br>attacked and shut down and when we talk<br>about critical infrastructure like an<br>Hospital<br>it's a huge huge problem<br>okay<br>so and then the question is you know why<br>is it still a problem like we have all<br>the technology I mean we're doing you<br>know all the ca kind of properties we<br>have authorization authentication<br>encryption everything is up to scratch<br>right why is a fishing still still a<br>problem<br>and you know with the technical solution<br>fishing bypass demo because fishing what<br>does we what basically happens with the<br>fishing is that you go through all the<br>authentication not authorization stuff<br>encryption because you send an email and<br>the email goes directly to the face of<br>your employees within the organization<br>now one of the questions could be do<br>every I mean<br>do we need to provide an email address<br>public facing to everybody in the<br>organization maybe not but at the moment<br>we're doing that and we're giving email<br>addresses to people that they maybe<br>don't know how to use them properly<br>right and they can click everything<br>because everything that comes to my<br>email inbox basically I can trust it<br>quick<br>and then enjoy<br>so<br>taking solution basically do not work<br>even if you have a fishing filters and<br>whatnot I mean that can happen even<br>before the email comes to your user and<br>we are talking about 150 millions of<br>email and we believe that there are 10<br>of emails still go through every day<br>right so the only answer then is that<br>the user that has that is basically<br>processing demo is the last line of<br>defense<br>and what do we do for supporting the<br>user ah basically we do some training we<br>send the phishing emails if they click<br>yeah<br>you click this link now watch this video<br>and we've done it here and we are so if<br>you ever see fishing emails in this<br>I mean not directly but we are<br>responding for that so you know there is<br>there is a lot of there are a lot of<br>options for training users to be<br>security awareness about fishing or not<br>the main problem is that like Esa 54 but<br>the last number was 65 percent of<br>organization that were hit by successful<br>fishing attack they run a pitching<br>training so basically training is not<br>working<br>actually I think yeah you might kind of<br>go make people angry so I'm gonna<br>collect everything so yeah I like those<br>Okay so<br>then the answer is if the human behind<br>you know before I say blame the user I<br>was the one who said that now I'm saying<br>the human behind the screen is your last<br>line of defense<br>what makes them most susceptible or less<br>susceptible to fishing what are the<br>variables what are the<br>what's happening in the mind when they<br>click on the lingo when they're reading<br>the email before clicking the link I<br>mean okay maybe the mind is a bit of big<br>deal there but what is the kind of<br>cognitive status for instance<br>and that's what we're trying to<br>understand and to do that I'm gonna use<br>a kind of small analogy here that is not<br>mine this is from Daniel logic uh we did<br>the presentation part of this<br>presentation together and this will be<br>her part and she does an excellent job<br>so I don't do that so<br>so this is a car 100 years ago so<br>usually when they were taking a corner<br>not that fast they were kind of rolling<br>on the roof or turn Turtle right<br>nowadays<br>it's a bit more difficult I mean you can<br>still do it I mean I can<br>I've never done it but I can so<br>you know you can still go on the roof of<br>the car put your car over roof but it's<br>not happening that often another<br>I was already like kind of messing up<br>the joke here on the chalkboard<br>why is that why cars and we don't see<br>that many cars over their roof<br>is it because we have a better better<br>drivers<br>or because we have better cars design<br>so we'll say a<br>nobody you guys are still listening<br>amazing so who says me<br>good yeah your pass without assuming<br>chat to GPT oh are you such a yeah<br>anyway so yeah so basically you know if<br>you look at our cars nowadays and you<br>don't need to have a super expensive<br>models like you know like a teslao or<br>not<br>there is a much more support around the<br>use I mean we start from the cameras I<br>mean you know hitting someone going<br>backwards now it's much more difficult<br>you can still do it but you have a<br>cameras you have a lot of extra cameras<br>around you<br>you have the I mean the car can<br>self-correct you or if you are departing<br>in the lane can tell you that something<br>is not happening there are a bit more<br>advanced cars that they can tell you for<br>tired you are too tired to drive because<br>of the way in which you are using your<br>steering wheel so there is a much more<br>support now think about the kind of maze<br>client that we use I hate how to look<br>for instance you know if I'm sending an<br>email to someone outside my organization<br>you have to look the first thing they<br>tell me do you want to remove that email<br>address because it's not within your<br>organization bloody hell I've sent this<br>email 100 times to this person it's<br>possible that you cannot remember that<br>I've sent already this email to this<br>person so do I need to remove so I have<br>this kind of alerting message but I<br>don't I don't read it anymore actually<br>it's very annoying I would like it to go<br>away but I cannot remove it so there is<br>this kind of frustration that you know<br>the software by electing me more and<br>more is creating to the user as I would<br>say that in terms of email client we are<br>with the cars like 100 years ago when we<br>go over the yeah I know that you love it<br>okay you're much better than me but<br>yeah you're very good with the Microsoft<br>stuff I've learned stuff from you yes<br>so<br>yeah I mean<br>I would say the car I mean you'll be<br>better driver than I am but cars oh<br>actually email client basically are like<br>cars under vs go and there isn't much<br>much more work that we can do for for<br>improving that<br>one of the things that I think we are<br>still lacking is again understanding<br>some of the process that are going<br>behind you know through the user when<br>they are reading the emails and this<br>could be you know could be done if we<br>use more Biometrics so we could read a<br>bit more about you know understanding<br>more the status of the user when they<br>are processing their their email and<br>this could help us understanding<br>susceptibility so why which variables<br>basically could be the main driver from<br>but the main problem is that building<br>these kind of studies is very very<br>difficult right so you know I wish I<br>could put like implants into users and<br>see them in front of a machine and then<br>bombarding them with the fishing game<br>and see what they do but yeah HR and<br>maybe the ethics<br>Eddie committee will be not that happy<br>about this<br>but so basically but we need basically<br>to come up with the new ways of dealing<br>so you know you know building this kind<br>of platform is not easy again I mean<br>fishing if you want to be realistic<br>right because that's what we want we<br>want to be as realistic as a<br>prototypical as possible I mean fishing<br>that comes I mean with the kind of the<br>frequency that comes to our inbox this<br>is not that of them right I mean<br>although there are 50 millions of email<br>that still goes through it's not like we<br>are bombarding called that so this is<br>It's a rare event<br>and then what you know what do we need<br>also because we want to make this<br>studies realistic we need to have a user<br>dealing with the day working environment<br>if we're talking like uh fishing in our<br>organization so you want them to dealing<br>with the working environment not only<br>fiscal but also digital environment<br>right so they they have to feel that<br>they own the team box and they care for<br>it I hope they care for it right it's<br>the main means of communication I<br>believe this kind of platform is<br>difficult nobody has done it and that's<br>why susceptibility Still Remains a big<br>problem because people either<br>concentrate on what happens before or<br>when they're reading but not in the<br>middle when the people are approaching<br>fishing or after approaching reading an<br>email so these are kind of one of the<br>main activities that we're doing with<br>the with my group with my my team<br>and then the other big problem is again<br>related to you know the tools that out<br>there again they are targeting big<br>markets and then when we talk about<br>smaller language is a much more<br>difficult for instance to build the<br>filters that try to understand if uh for<br>instance an email coming in Maori is uh<br>is official or not and one of the things<br>that we're trying to understand for<br>instance is whether an email that comes<br>with a specific language basically for<br>people that can understand that language<br>if it basically has more<br>um<br>trust is more trustworthy and they<br>basically would click on it and you know<br>again when we talk about small<br>communities again we're talking about<br>languages that are not very kind of uh<br>you know out there that have many kind<br>of samples right and so Maori is one<br>example over here and we're also trying<br>to do some kind of work with the uh the<br>Pacific island as well because again<br>there we need to understand what you<br>know actually we need to kind of build a<br>kind of bit of Baseline because I think<br>they are you know their resources are<br>even more limited than what we have over<br>here and so with the esa and my kind of<br>group of phds we are in connection with<br>the several kind of organization of the<br>Pacific island where we are trying to<br>kind of first doing some kind of<br>experiment or you know basic phishing<br>attacks or training let's say or attacks<br>and then understanding more if you know<br>language again is a different kind of<br>people we trust more and they fall more<br>for fishing and they're reported to them<br>where they kind of you know their gaps<br>are hopefully they can find some kind of<br>solution and in general you know in<br>terms of research also to build more<br>capability it's not totally you know for<br>you know my general research group but<br>again I would like to kind of be able<br>for uh<br>any kind of kind of you know for<br>catering for more diversity as well in<br>order to you know be able to build their<br>own their own systems<br>I don't know if I have a joke now I<br>don't think so yeah I know I'm just<br>concluding now<br>Okay so<br>cyber threats are not going away so it's<br>a it's a it's a problem that is gonna<br>stay with us for quite a time I mean<br>even if we have you know some people can<br>say oh okay why don't you deploy AI to<br>protect us yeah sure we can do that but<br>then the attackers are doing the same so<br>whether the human is gonna be in the<br>loop is a different story but it's<br>something that you know we need to kind<br>of um we will see what happens there<br>importing solution again these are<br>another kind of typical behavior that we<br>have here in New Zealand is all I mean<br>we're gonna buy products from someone<br>else Microsoft Amazon what not that we<br>bring here and yeah we can do that but<br>again we are missing building the<br>capability we should think more I mean<br>okay each trial is a bit of an extreme<br>there but you know they do their own<br>thing and they are so good that the<br>basically sell to others<br>again as I say it's an extreme situation<br>but there are the small economies that<br>around the European area for instance<br>that can you know they are very similar<br>in scale and kind of level of resources<br>and we could look more into kind of this<br>um you know what they're doing there<br>again not importing the model because<br>again we have to look at you know the<br>kind of specific situation that is<br>happening over here but there are<br>several kind of initiatives that we<br>could we could do uh related to you know<br>building building capability building<br>the pipeline<br>and at the end of the day so not only so<br>we need to build our own<br>uh<br>uh you know cohort of experts in the<br>country but also we need to build our<br>own Tech our own technology that in case<br>also exporting to other<br>um in other markets where basically for<br>instance they have small communities of<br>indigenous people for instance they are<br>not catered at all and you know we could<br>from the lesson learned over here we<br>could also export this lesson learned in<br>other in other in other parts of the<br>world<br>okay so as you can imagine I mean I mean<br>I don't get any kind of uh you know I<br>mean so now<br>ah<br>so people can I don't have white gloves<br>James but I think people can still<br>understand so<br>the<br>you know become your professor one I<br>mean yeah it's something that uh it's<br>enough<br>business maybe a kind of uh I push<br>myself through it but if you look at the<br>achievement that I've kind of got during<br>this year it's not a one kind of person<br>only so these are thanks to people that<br>have worked together with me so yeah you<br>think Danielle uh Robert Bido pork of<br>Bales all my phds of over here they've<br>been super instrumental for you know<br>doing all the other work I just come<br>with the idea similarly say maybe<br>something else but you know you know you<br>have to have some some kind of like<br>initial ideas and then let them you know<br>ride a bike and then at one point also<br>starting steering goal in their own<br>Direction<br>plus I mean these slides are not very<br>visible but you know I also have like a<br>good<br>network of people work to me Stephen is<br>uh is over here we have also<br>another professor David Ayers is a<br>professor now uh Ian Welsh and um uh<br>vimal Kumar so we work on kind of all in<br>cyber security from different<br>universities<br>been very I mean I think it's kind of<br>there is some good capabilities over<br>here I don't I don't know how long ago<br>we're gonna last but it's um you know<br>it's something that we are pretty proud<br>of what we have achieved so far<br>and so I've been this University for<br>what 11 years now so at four of this<br>year I've been the head of ahead of the<br>school which is the smallest school and<br>it's not that big but<br>it's a couple of time and resources so I<br>have to thank first of all all my score<br>of the staff member around here that<br>have been supporting me I've been<br>Sicilian as you say loving my blood we<br>had some robust discussion with the with<br>the most of them I mean no well with the<br>muscle we must with some of them and you<br>know we understood each other I think<br>we're growing but also like I would like<br>to thank all the heads from the other<br>school I mean there's James there Jane<br>Stephen here<br>they've been very very supportive and<br>the dean of course I mean because he<br>brought the you know very supportive<br>letter for me to get through so but<br>again it was an offer that he could not<br>refuse<br>you know I would like to think a chart<br>Cassandra and or a team and all the<br>people around us that have kind of<br>I mean around me that they've kind of<br>supported me so over this year so<br>yeah I mean as I said I mean it's not to<br>my achievement that everybody<br>achievement I would say and um<br>I mean people that know me you know<br>usually<br>they see me a bit more energetic and I<br>apologize if I apologize if I'm not that<br>energetic tonight because I just slept<br>for three and a half hours I could say<br>that it wasn't because I wasn't<br>preparing the the presentation but I was<br>not I wasn't playing Slot Cards Scarlets<br>last night winning a couple other races<br>so you get the super exciting full of<br>adrenaline and you cannot sleep so these<br>are spend the last night and with this I<br>conclude<br>thank you very much and if you have any<br>questions<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
