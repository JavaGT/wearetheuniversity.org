deputy dean of um The<br>Faculty of Science and I'm standing in<br>for John Hoskins Who would have really<br>liked to have been here but he can't<br>here for tonight and it nevertheless<br>it's my pleasure to be here Warren to<br>introduce you for your professorial and<br>AAL lecture and it's taken a while to go<br>from promotion to actually having this<br>but it is an auspicious occasion so I<br>really want to acknowledge acknowledge<br>you one and um also I just want to take<br>a moment to acknowledge the fundamental<br>science that is mathematics and um the<br>fact that at this time where we can see<br>the changes and the and the drivers for<br>we hear words like transdisciplinarity<br>where he concepts of trying to meet<br>societal needs and we all do this well<br>mathematics actually does this all the<br>time and I just want to acknowledge as a<br>representative of the faculty of science<br>that I think fundamental science and and<br>Mathematics has to be a foundational<br>component of anything we do because at<br>the end of today Society rests on<br>fundamental discoveries and and you know<br>what we found out a bit about that this<br>week with the um uh the announcements of<br>the Nobel prizes but fundamental science<br>will always have a place I think in this<br>faculty of science so I just want to<br>make that comment and Warren of course<br>you are a fundamental scientist and<br>you're also an outstanding academic<br>you've got a superb track record across<br>teaching research and service and if I<br>just go back a little and look at your<br>career you first study here here so<br>you're an alma M of this University and<br>you have come back and been an<br>incredible contributor to it so I just<br>want to acknowledge that you completed<br>your PhD at Newcastle University you<br>went on to post at Simon Fraser<br>University in Canada came back and the<br>post here headed off to work as a<br>research fellow at Victoria University<br>of Wellington a research academic at<br>White CER University you were sorting<br>out the competition you and then you<br>came back here to resume a role in 20 in<br>in in 2003 with the Department of<br>Mathematics and you've been here ever<br>since and in that time that you've been<br>here you have been an incredible<br>contributor to uh mathematics and to<br>that department you have held the deputy<br>uh head role twice you've contributed to<br>Major curriculum developments you've<br>looked at workload which we all know is<br>a tricky Beast<br>unsuccessfully W what can you<br>do that and numerous other activities so<br>you have been a sterling citizen in the<br>University of O I just want to<br>acknowledge that you've published more<br>than 80 papers in top tier academic<br>journals and you've got monographs<br>happening or perhaps already through uh<br>and I just want to make a comment that<br>Warren's papers some of them are quite<br>lengthy and a lot of them are are sole<br>authored and um this is the nature of<br>mathematics and I I I think that's<br>something that we really have to<br>remember remember it doesn't always fit<br>within the academic standards of a<br>university but I want to acknowledge<br>that because it's really impressive and<br>it's particularly impressive given the<br>service roles that you've had um you<br>have an enviable catalog of invited<br>International plenary lectures and they<br>are a testament to your International<br>reputation as is um your uh membership<br>as one of only two fellows of the<br>Australian mathematical Society you're<br>also a fellow of the New Zealand<br>mathematical societ Society um you're a<br>world expert in the field of topology<br>and I thought it was really interesting<br>on reading a little bit more about you<br>that after you solved the lman Phelps<br>problem I had to go look that up and<br>then I had to look up a few more things<br>to try and understand what that was but<br>you were described as one of the best<br>researchers of your generation and it's<br>who said<br>that it's not which generation was it<br>it's not surprising that your track<br>record o includes funding from New<br>Zealand's Premier year um and<br>prestigious uh funding mechanism which<br>is the Marsden fund so uh you have made<br>a sterling contribution to your<br>discipline to fundamental science and to<br>the university through the faulty of<br>Science and on behalf of the dean who<br>can't be here tonight I want to<br>acknowledge that and I want to<br>congratulate you on your promotion to<br>Professor Waring it's well deserved and<br>I want to invite everyone to give you a<br>warm welcome welcome to Del your an<br>overall professorial<br>address well I'd like to thank you J for<br>that introduction I wondered who you<br>were talking<br>about so one of the reasons I write<br>papers by myself is I simply don't have<br>friends and first you got to know you<br>could have co-authors so so if<br>everyone's read this um it's where the<br>talk really starts I just wanted to<br>check one thing before I<br>start and I sort of asked beforehand is<br>is whether this talks editable if I can<br>cut stuff<br>out is it good CU I was worried I was<br>going to have to delete all this stuff<br>out of my<br>talk okay so my talks are going to be in<br>three parts or four parts if you include<br>questions and um so hopefully at least<br>2/3 of the talks accessible to most<br>people and uh that the third one which<br>is um our second one actually the one on<br>mess hopefully doesn't last too long<br>okay and I it says my journey to ockland<br>but as JR said actually I was a student<br>here earlier<br>so so here are some of the places I went<br>to now you won't recognize some of these<br>but there was my primary school in West<br>Oakland<br>aroi then I went to Black House Bay<br>intermediate or<br>BBI after that I went to Green Bay High<br>School which is um out west as well<br>and then I came to University of Oakland<br>which had a logo it looked more like<br>that back<br>then and I used to tell people that<br>work seems<br>plausible okay after that I went off and<br>um went to Newcastle did my PhD it has a<br>logo set something like I look ahead and<br>between this one you may not recognize<br>apart from maybe t let's probably say<br>something like Academy it's a Bulgarian<br>Academy of Sciences which probably over<br>the years 20 years or so i' probably<br>spent a year and a half there but always<br>in like one month blocks or two month<br>blocks um now where do we go after that<br>so yeah then I went to Simon Fraser<br>where I did a post do so it's a Simon<br>Fraser logo I came back to Oakland back<br>there then I went to Victoria to as a be<br>a postdoctoral fellow then I got my<br>first real job where I actually had to<br>lecture for money and I was at WTO and I<br>was pretty happy there but I was always<br>a go since I came from Oakland W to come<br>back here and eventually I came back<br>here I think that's just about covered<br>all of them I I went to other places as<br>well but they were they were the main<br>ones along my trip<br>here and the odd thing is I gave my<br>first ever lecture just over there in<br>MLT 3 when well I'll talk about that<br>later but it seems strange to be almost<br>back where you started with so on the<br>initial version of this I actually put<br>the years in<br>like born and raised in West Stockland<br>so I actually put the dates in and then<br>when I showed it to my partner Julia she<br>goes maybe maybe they're just too<br>personal you don't really want people to<br>know how old you really<br>are okay but here's a picture um I'm the<br>one on the right for you guys<br>that one there and the other one's my<br>brother and i' I actually wrote down his<br>job<br>description so I mean it's in com so I<br>don't really know what this stuff is<br>he's a finance lead partner hyphen<br>corporate finance and treasury at the<br>warehouse group so another way of say he<br>just works the red sheds and um so I'm<br>family so I went Aro primary school then<br>BBI and then Green Bay High School and<br>the funny thing is when we're looking<br>for where my children should go to<br>school cuz I sort of live out west still<br>well did then and we went to Green Bay<br>High and we went to the Mets block which<br>was if block and on the wall there was<br>actually some pictures of me from when I<br>won the New Zealand met award really<br>quite<br>weird actually one of the teachers<br>recognized me from the picture this<br>embarrassing so after Green Bay High<br>School I came here I did physics um<br>which I sort of<br>enjoyed um I thought to go further in<br>physics I should do some meths well more<br>meths because i' done meths but really<br>only calculus and differential equations<br>I I hadn't really done any group<br>symmetries or anything like that so I<br>went back and did pure<br>maths and after I did that I remember<br>thinking I'm not sure if I want to go<br>back to physics so after that I did some<br>certificate of proficiencies or cops I<br>did one on general relativity and uh one<br>on quantum mechanics and I did some<br>astrophysics courses for fun but I never<br>really went back and I really didn't<br>have many regrets really um I still love<br>physics I think it's more natural Than<br>Mathematics for most people but<br>um yeah no regrets many years later when<br>I came back here as a post no it's<br>actually when I came back as a lecturer<br>in 2003 I knew a lot of people in the<br>physics department and they just assumed<br>I got a job in physics and I said no not<br>in physics and they said I must be<br>applied maths I said no not applied<br>maths like pure maths and I always said<br>you got to edit this out um sort of<br>experimental physics is a bit like<br>applied no can't say<br>this so anyway after my masters for some<br>strange reason the university trusted me<br>to actually lecture the this uh first<br>year algebra course it's a bit like<br>maths 120 now I didn't even have a PhD I<br>just had a master's and a master and<br>cond was around at that time so he can<br>explain why they had faith in me to<br>teach this course but I believe some<br>fantastic I won't say that I just wrote<br>the talk like literally the night before<br>up until about 3: in the<br>morning it was fresh in my mind when I<br>gave it okay now into the '90s<br>so these people these guys on the right<br>did physics one's John how many people<br>from physics here that are old okay so<br>this guy here is John Dudley who went<br>under physics from France or wherever<br>and these people on the left tend to be<br>uh mathematics and<br>um that woman there went on and that did<br>law so no one's perfect okay and this<br>was actually from um the dogs bollocks<br>Pub it used to be up on K Road those<br>didn't know<br>that okay so I went off and did my PhD<br>um then this is a crazy but I came back<br>and they let me lecture one 121<br>again basically I just taught the same<br>course again sort of surprised I had a<br>bit of a loose end end for various<br>personal reasons and<br>whatnot and then I applied for some post<br>dos and I got this one at Simon Fraser<br>what are you<br>saying now I can only be insulted so<br>much the next time I'm out of here<br>okay it reminds me of what Karen malav<br>ago you know what it was I'm not sharing<br>okay and um so I did the post do and<br>that was quite interesting so I was<br>engaged and I didn't really want to<br>leave Canada cuz there's a certain<br>benefit of being in Canada not only is<br>the University bigger there but people<br>traveled through all the time Terry<br>Rockefeller from optimization which he<br>was just about 150 Mi south of us and he<br>used to bring his group up there all the<br>time but I wanted to get married back in<br>New Zealand or more to the point I guess<br>more my um f they did so we came back to<br>New Zealand and I was lucky enough and I<br>think Mar knows this as well I think I<br>was in the first generation of these New<br>Zealand Science and Technology post<br>stocks and they're really quite good CU<br>not only do they pay your salary they<br>actually give you quite a lot of money<br>to travel so I came back and uh did one<br>of those and I got quite a few visitors<br>I I mean you have a lot of money to<br>spend on these things I'm not sure they<br>exist anymore<br>though so that brought me back to<br>Oakland so this was at Oakland<br>this one here and then after that I was<br>a loosen again and uh Vladimir pistoff<br>found me up and said oh I went to a<br>conference once that you organized would<br>you would like to apply for a fellowship<br>I said what's it in and he said it's all<br>and super geometry and I thought oh man<br>I don't know anything about that and he<br>said uh start out working on Super<br>geometry if it doesn't pan out you can<br>just do whatever you like so he had a<br>Mas and ground on super geometry and um<br>so after about 6 months and I really<br>tried hard to learn this stuff and you<br>can understand it but I didn't have<br>intuition for it so in the end he said I<br>just do whatever you like so I went off<br>and did whatever I liked two years later<br>I'd actually left I was actually gone up<br>to W at that stage and then he had to do<br>his final report on the mar Grant and<br>they looked at the titles of the papers<br>and they said not one of them's got the<br>word super geometry in<br>them so I sort of awkward cuz i' already<br>left and um I I think at that stage<br>Vladimir was thinking of leaving as well<br>okay some further facts my first<br>permanent position was at wetto in 1999<br>I saved there three and a half years and<br>I really enjoyed that cuz when I was<br>there I was still young enough I I<br>played in the local football team<br>actually that's not true the first year<br>I was there I used to play up in ockland<br>and I used to come up for training and<br>Saturday every<br>week so I got to know l Lally the every<br>crack on the road every<br>signpost and um after that after one<br>year of doing that I thought it was just<br>crazy so I played for West Hamilton<br>Club and then um and then eventually I<br>came up here I always it was always my<br>plan if I could if I was lucky enough to<br>come back here so a job came up in 2003<br>and I was really happy at wo it wasn't<br>an easy decision to leave even after<br>they offered me the job house price<br>prices here were literally double what<br>they were on Hamilton at the time so we<br>were looking at houses and Hamilton and<br>they said what what's your upper range<br>and we said there is no upper range cuz<br>like the mech there was like the minimum<br>in Oakland was just a crazy disparity in<br>prices and the salaries are the same so<br>the people are white they more or less<br>get the same salary scale as us maybe a<br>couple of thousand dollar less I mean<br>it's really basically the same parkings<br>free everything it's just<br>of to<br>there ah it's more than you it's hold up<br>got to get the motto right it's more<br>expect that is almost certainly true is<br>because you should not expect much cuz<br>we're not as young Hamilton was just<br>something you drove through you know it<br>literally was it was all farming you<br>just drove gr down Victoria Street and<br>out the other side but it's changed when<br>I first went there on the first Saturday<br>I went in there and there were cafes all<br>in the middle of town it had really<br>become quite<br>Metropolitan some winter days you saw<br>the sun from 2:00 in the afternoon till<br>3:00 in the afternoon yeah and there is<br>fog I mean when I us to do football you<br>go out to training and you literally<br>couldn't see the football coming to you<br>until it was about 3 yards away and I<br>never seen that before even with flood<br>lights they don't help you just get<br>reflection and that you get used to it<br>but it's very strange at the<br>start oh and this was um one of the<br>advertising Flyers this was my talk in<br>Prague in 2006 I remember it say this is<br>not so long long ago that you actually<br>did stuff on<br>blackboards but in 2006 if people were<br>very very very good memories there were<br>some problems with some planes flying<br>into Heath thr airport and I thought<br>there were some bombers on board<br>so I was flying into Heath well actually<br>I hadn't even got that far I was flying<br>into Doha and then onto Heath and we<br>stopped there and they took everything<br>off us and I mean everything so all your<br>hand luggage you lost you got to keep<br>your your wallet and your passport and<br>that's it you couldn't even keep your<br>jackets cuz I worried about bombs being<br>in jackets and things in your shoelaces<br>and all that sort of stuff so they took<br>it all away and it never arrived in time<br>for my lecture so when I was in Prague<br>um I actually had to just make up the<br>talk you know I sort of memorized it and<br>I just did on the<br>Blackboard um but I learned to listen<br>from that afterwards I always put my<br>talks on my web pages so even if you<br>lose all your stuff you can still access<br>it by the web that was that's back in<br>2006 so um yeah I looked younger there<br>too oh<br>was okay and some other stuff along the<br>way yeah I was already mentioned um and<br>along the way I got married um Serena is<br>my oldest and um she's now engineer and<br>Fraser now works for the Ministry of<br>Social<br>Development that's them when they were<br>young I don't know the exact ages<br>there's a story behind this photo I left<br>this photo behind at Y ketto and several<br>years later Steven Joe who someone Works<br>down there he he just brought it up and<br>I I didn't even know i' lost it so I<br>just took a photo of it and stuck it up<br>here my guess is it looks like he's a<br>year old maybe I don't know something<br>like that so that means Serena's about<br>four this is him a bit<br>older this one means something to me<br>this is Fraser's last day of primary<br>school so they do this crazy thing now<br>where you do graduation from primary<br>school like it's a thing<br>and so hey go and they do prizegiving<br>and all sorts of stuff so he got all<br>dressed up for that and that's Serena<br>she's got Wings on and I'm pretty sure<br>that's at my mother-in-law's place cuz<br>of the doors in the<br>background and this is everyone a bit<br>older that's<br>Serena how old is this STS about 3 years<br>yes about three years ago and that's<br>Fraser growing up and that's Julia and<br>that's me and this is down in our P<br>kariki I don't know if Johnny recognizes<br>it back on back here is pukarua Bay cuz<br>that's actually a place called fishing<br>table or just outside on the actually<br>just by the cliff<br>there must have got someone else to take<br>the photo okay along the way I met lots<br>of people and I mean a lot more than<br>this you know how do you summarize who<br>you're going to put in but there are<br>some people that I really had to put in<br>um this guy here yell out his name if<br>you know who it is you know I know who<br>that is Jo Chef yeah see he's old yeah<br>so this is Joel chef and hey he really<br>encouraged<br>me so he really encouraged me in my<br>meths so I had rather unusual study<br>patterns and I don't really publicize<br>this so for most people unless they<br>taught me this will been used to<br>them oh actually I've got some current<br>students here so don't listen to this so<br>assignments ever apart from once when I<br>did estro physics 270 and um Phil yach<br>came up to me and said do you realize<br>the Project's worth 40% compulsory I<br>mean no I don't so so I did on the<br>Hubble telescope and back when there was<br>a new thing<br>um ni will know how how long ago that<br>was unfortunately and um yeah so I<br>walked night and day Saturday Sunday<br>Monday and handed in and got an aage<br>grade but I wasn't lazy I used to go to<br>lectures and try to learn live in real<br>time people say it can't be done it can<br>I I know other people that did it but<br>the thing that made me slightly unusual<br>was I didn't even take notes so I really<br>Beed myself to learn stuff so for me<br>good lecturers really mattered if they<br>were I was in<br>trouble this guy was brilliant I could<br>literally learn alive in his lectures<br>and not even have to go away afterwards<br>and actually think about stuff there was<br>another guy but I couldn't find this uh<br>photo was a guy an American Guy taught<br>here is David Smith and he also licked<br>in a way that I could literally learn<br>this stuff in real time there were lots<br>of other good lectures I had i m and<br>taught me all I don't know about number<br>Theory but actually I quite liked this<br>lecturing style was also a style where I<br>could just learn live in the<br>lectures I don't recommend it it's high<br>risk a lot of courses had plused but not<br>all of them so you you're literally<br>giving up marks I personally and I don't<br>express this at meetings I don't like<br>the way we force people to jump through<br>hoops to get marks I think of at the end<br>of the course you can pass it the<br>material no matter what that's good<br>enough but that's sort of gone out of<br>fashion that style but we still have<br>plus which is quite good which still<br>encourages us and I never swatted the<br>first time I ever swatted was I had this<br>um girlfriend who was doing was like<br>third year Torx which by the way I never<br>did as a student and um and we were over<br>at her place we were using a book called<br>galdi so people would do discreet mess<br>know this and we just went through the<br>whole book in like two nights before the<br>exam I swear to God I could have done it<br>wasn't 326 it was like 315 or something<br>325 maybe I could have passed the course<br>just in those two days and it struck me<br>I thought actually there's something to<br>the swatting now this might sound really<br>stupid but hey occurred to me that you<br>could locally memorize stuff because it<br>was never a goal it was never my goal to<br>get grades I just went to I was really<br>idealistic I just wanted to know why<br>things worked that's why I did<br>physics I didn't turn up to get a grade<br>I just want to know why stuff worked if<br>people said stuff to me that wasn't<br>consistent and sometimes when physics is<br>taught at a low level you know they say<br>things that are strictly not<br>true I mean you know they haven't got<br>time or something<br>I try to never ever do that to my<br>students I never lie to them it's better<br>to say this is beyond what I can teach<br>in this course and and just stick to the<br>truth okay okay sorry I really got<br>distracted<br>there this is good because it's going to<br>minimize the amount of Ms okay so this<br>John Jo oops I went the wrong<br>whoops there we go say John JS my um PhD<br>supervisor that's from the 60s when he<br>first got a academic appointment at<br>newcast<br>um this is Scott Cipher he was um<br>probably my best friend in Mets he was<br>do a PhD at Newcastle and we still<br>friends and E still in well Mand if<br>anyone knows who that is um try and do<br>them in order uh this is John bne I did<br>my first post do with him we became<br>really close friends and up until he<br>died in<br>2017 and whenever I went to Canada I'd<br>always stay at his house and uh got to<br>know his family really really well so it<br>hurt quite a lot when he died he was<br>65 um he's probably a little bit<br>overweight at the time but you know<br>still was still quite shocking um that's<br>Peter Kinder off and the Bulgarian Ken<br>of Sciences he treated me really well<br>way better than anyone in New Zealand<br>ever treated me um<br>I I got to meet the prime minister of<br>Bulgaria wearing t-shirts and shorts and<br>all sorts of stuff he had quite a lot of<br>political Nails um one last time I went<br>over there in 2018 I got got quite sick<br>um he knew the guy in charge of the uh<br>the hospital in<br>Sophia and I just went in and I I got<br>treatment within about 10 minutes I just<br>quue jumped they were doing CAT scans<br>and um ultrasound on me within like 10<br>minutes of tuning out and um Peter said<br>that the guy was trying to get into<br>bulgan Academy of Sciences so you got to<br>be accredited to get in and and now P<br>pet involved in the accreditations but<br>it was just brilliant I wouldn't have<br>got that treatment in New Zealand even<br>with Southern Cross insurance or<br>whatever it just wouldn't have happened<br>it was literally I went straight into<br>the hospital they gave me all this<br>medication straight out back to the<br>academy again so it's very good um this<br>is the guy Isaac namioka who died a few<br>years ago he was a bit of an idol for me<br>because I like the way he wrote his<br>proofs he wrote things very elegantly he<br>would never survive in the current<br>climate because I think when he was<br>about 65 he'd only written like 30<br>papers or 35 he would not meet the<br>academic standards to become an<br>associate professor but of course every<br>paper he wrote had hundreds and hundreds<br>of citations was just a different era he<br>wasn't under pressured or published a<br>lot and he was really kind to me when I<br>was post stocking in Vancouver so John<br>bne does quite applied stuff<br>optimization and actually more applied<br>than what I do but this guy he was his<br>training was in algebra and then he he<br>learned topology with guy uh John Kelly<br>told him topology and then he sort of<br>swapped over to functional analysis but<br>he he was still very pure in the way he<br>thought and he used to read over my<br>handwritten man<br>manuscripts I he had nothing in it no<br>benefit for him and then he mailed them<br>back to me it's old school snail mail<br>and um so he supported me in a time when<br>was like my outlet cuz when I was Jo<br>he's a great guy but he was always<br>stuff okay this is hin<br>bki whoops said wrong um sorry to the<br>German people here it looks like you<br>would say it's hin bki but it's more<br>like hind Bel SCH something and who was<br>a student of John he was actually a PhD<br>student when I was a postto now he's a<br>professor at UBC uh he's supported me<br>over my career he's a really nice guy<br>and this guy here he was a student of<br>Ivan Riley and I can tell you the first<br>time I met him was in<br>1997 I was back I think my post stock<br>back here it almost finished and um Ian<br>arranged for us to meet each other we<br>worked on a paper um don't remember<br>exactly what it was but I remember I we<br>started working on topological games and<br>ever since we've always stayed in touch<br>and we were both looking for jobs at the<br>same time and<br>now he he's been a professor now for for<br>how many<br>years 10 so no maybe maybe slightly less<br>in there and so he's done quite well and<br>I've sort of been so everyone here's a<br>professor by the way oh no apart from<br>so okay now I really wanted to have my<br>phone with me and I'm not going to blame<br>Julia but okay<br>so so I'm not sure if this is readable<br>but we got some meths and it says dinner<br>miracle occurs it's but look like during<br>my lectures you just get to the tricky<br>but then America occurs so applications<br>of topology to analysis so over my<br>career I've actually worked in quite a<br>few different areas<br>um so geometry here's not what you think<br>this is actually geometry of Baro spaces<br>which is actually quite so they're all<br>somehow related to each other um conx<br>analysis A study of certain class of<br>functions their differentiability their<br>applications optimization on smooth<br>analysis is like a bigger class of<br>functions which includes convex<br>functions and you can you used to be<br>used a lot in<br>optimization and then there's<br>optimization Theory and then there's<br>variational analysis which is related to<br>optimization which is when if you can't<br>solve this really hard problem you<br>perturb it to a NE neighboring problem<br>that you can solve use the solutions of<br>that problem to solve the original<br>problem uh then I did topological groups<br>in fact things called semi topological<br>groups and paratopological groups and<br>quasy top olical which all all a lot of<br>them are related to what they call<br>topological Dynamics which is um you<br>know groups acting on phase spaces that<br>have certain<br>properties whoops not what I meant to do<br>uh then I de on General topology and<br>linear topology linear topology is just<br>general topology where you got addition<br>and scale of multiplication for those<br>that know what that is a little bit of<br>fix Point Theory but actually more when<br>you got families of fun function and you<br>want one point which is fixed by all the<br>functions or they call them coincidence<br>serums and um also the differentiability<br>of flip functions it's sort of more<br>technical<br>okay so what got say in this talk this<br>is what you love your lecture to do to<br>read the slide because he's forgotten<br>what he wrote and this all focus on a<br>topic that lies at the interface of<br>three of those topics okay so one of the<br>things so there's two types of people do<br>optimiz ation there are people that<br>really want to get results so I went to<br>a conference once with John B and this<br>is the point when I actually gave up<br>doing optimization I didn't tell John so<br>it's meant to be this crossover one<br>there were people from Bell Laboratories<br>and all these people from industry along<br>with all the really pure mathematicians<br>pretending to do<br>optimization and John was giving a talk<br>on something that I was helping with and<br>the guy from Bell laborator put up his<br>hand he said I've got a question he said<br>you know will you show that converg to<br>that<br>sequence um how quickly is it and John<br>told what do you mean he said is it like<br>quadratic convergence or is it linear<br>and uh sorry this is a joke that only M<br>people understand but John said actually<br>we no we showed a converter in the weak<br>topology cuz they wanted to know how<br>many iterations you actually had to do<br>to get a really good solution or a near<br>good solution and John didn't tell them<br>that he'd actually been running this<br>half cray computer for like a week or<br>two weeks I mean it's just it's just<br>struck me these people were using this<br>um re revised Simplex algorithm which is<br>just like linear stuff but with a big<br>machine and I'd run it half an hour or<br>an hour and it may not be even near the<br>best solution but it was a lot better<br>than what they had currently and that<br>that that's all they wanted so then I<br>realized well maybe I didn't realize but<br>I thought to myself I thought this is<br>really fake maths this is like pure<br>mathematicians looking because it was<br>all done on abstract B spaces they're<br>looking for a topic to apply this stuff<br>so ever since then I S sort of my<br>interest in optimization died away a bit<br>after that really directly changed my<br>feeling on these things so constrained<br>optimization what's that you're trying<br>to find the max or the minimum of some<br>function subject to some<br>constraints what you want you want you<br>want to know there is a best Sol<br>solution or a worst solution you know<br>Max or a Min you want to know it's<br>Unique there only one helps when you're<br>trying to describe it and you want to<br>know it's somehow robust so if you<br>perturb things a little bit or maybe if<br>it's built upon measurements there might<br>be slight inaccuracies in the<br>measurements you you want the max or the<br>men to more or less be the same whoops<br>and not trip over okay<br>so I can't really explain this stuff<br>because it's an infinite dimensional<br>Bano spaces but I can do a really<br>concrete example which is um everyone in<br>physics science they take experiment<br>experimental data sometimes you try to<br>find the best line that go through the<br>points linear regression there this is<br>actually an optimization problem and a<br>constrainted optimization problem why<br>the constraint is the fact that you're<br>only restricting yourself to linear maps<br>in a sense they all look like y = mx<br>plus C the variables here are the slope<br>and the constant they're the actual<br>variables in the problem I'm about to<br>show you okay and what we're trying to<br>do is we're trying to minimize the sum<br>of the squares of the<br>error so I remember the first time I<br>learned this stuff was I was in the 7th<br>form or year 13 as they call it<br>now and I thought like why do why are we<br>squaring the errors before we add them<br>up so what you do is if you got a line<br>going through here you're measuring this<br>number here here this number here this<br>number here this number here and so on<br>and you sum them all up but you don't<br>really do that you actually square that<br>distance you square it you square it so<br>if it's further one you square a number<br>it gets even bigger if it's less than<br>one you square it it gets smaller so<br>it's putting a certain what seemed like<br>to me an unnatural waiting on<br>it and what you're trying to do you so<br>you got a two dimensional<br>constraints the only things that you can<br>change are the m and the C so that's a<br>basically a two- dimensional problem and<br>the thing you're trying to minimize<br>is oh actually on the next side so but<br>the good thing about least squares is it<br>always<br>exists that's good if you want to find<br>the line of best fit to actually know<br>there is one and it's Unique that's good<br>but the really good thing is even if you<br>get your data point slightly wrong and<br>then some experimental error the actual<br>solution the m and the C don't change<br>much it's really robust under small<br>perturbations so my idea when I was at<br>um School actually and I never really<br>knew the answer to this until you know I<br>was actually after my PhD really so you<br>got some data points there's like three<br>ways to measure the error that top way<br>was the way I thought was natural whoops<br>there was that<br>me okay so this top way just says you<br>literally take this distance this<br>distance this distance this you add them<br>all up I mean if it goes down you make a<br>positive add them all up that seems like<br>a natural way to measure the distance<br>that corresponds to doing geometry and<br>what they call the L1 Norm so that is to<br>say if you have two points and you want<br>to find the distance between them you<br>don't go like that and use Pythagoras<br>Theorem you go vertically down you go<br>distance that's on the<br>recording<br>plus that distance there's no squaring<br>it's just that's that distance there<br>okay then this is Max one what that<br>saying what you're looking at is the<br>maximum error so if things you only look<br>at the worst case so in that case is<br>what you're saying is you're trying to<br>minimize the maximum of things and the<br>most complicated one is this one and<br>this is the one that you actually use<br>but the good thing is geometrically<br>that's just used using the idian norm<br>which literally is like Pythagoras you<br>want find the distance between<br>them you put a little right angle<br>Triangle Square that square that add it<br>together take square root or whatever<br>get that okay but formulaically it's the<br>most<br>difficult so blank<br>slide this is the part of the talk I was<br>most worried about so now I have to<br>convince you from something about<br>equations so if I was to draw this<br>optimization problem if you have in data<br>points you actually embed the problem in<br>RN and because you've only got two<br>variables let me go back the two<br>variables M and C the actual you're sort<br>of looking at the space spand Sorry for<br>using that word it's basically a two-<br>dimensional problem these are the only<br>things you get to control so what you<br>have is a two-dimensional Subspace and<br>IND dimensional space I can't really<br>draw that and you're trying to find the<br>nearest point to the<br>origin well here You' be using the L1<br>Norm that this this whichever one I drew<br>there<br>this is the ukian norm and this is<br>something called the max normal Infinity<br>Norm okay so now what does this look so<br>first of all see the big blue circle oh<br>actually that didn't come out okay so<br>this big blue circle that's everything<br>whose distance away from the zero is<br>four with respect to the ukan<br>norm it's light blue on the inside I'm<br>not sure if you can see that very well<br>they're all the points whose distance is<br>less than four and now we take a line so<br>everything outside the dark circle is<br>more than four away I look at this line<br>here it touches at a single point I mean<br>geometrically it should be a single<br>point comes out the other side so the<br>nearest point on this line is just one<br>point it's that point there everything<br>out here it's more than four away that<br>one point where it touches it's four<br>everywhere else it's more than four away<br>so it's got a unique nearest Point okay<br>as so I changed the line a bit now I<br>Chang it here change the slope a bit and<br>see it still touched actually this was<br>actually sort of drawn by hand so it<br>doesn't quite touch but let's suppose it<br>touches it would touch at one point and<br>the point where it touches is very<br>similar it's hardly moved at<br>all even for really quite big<br>changes what the hell is this okay so<br>this is now working the L1 Norm that guy<br>where we measure the distance this way<br>that distance plus that distance if I<br>always look at all this<br>Point whose distance away from the<br>origin is exactly four I get that dark<br>blue<br>line everything on the inside is less<br>than four away from the center<br>everything on the outside is more than<br>four away so I go along this line more<br>than four more than four more than four<br>oh four four four distance four four<br>four four four oh more than four more<br>than four more than four so everything<br>here is actually in nearest<br>Point there's lots of them okay that's<br>not good that's not the end of the world<br>though what if I perturb the line of<br>it oh look it's got one nearest Point<br>that's really good except it's way up<br>here now suppose I perturbed it a little<br>bit the other way whoops it's all the<br>way way down here now by blowing this<br>out and drawing the right line I can<br>make the distance from that to that to<br>be as big as I like that is not Cent<br>that's not what you're looking for so<br>two people could do the same experiment<br>same data well more or less the same<br>data and when they look for their line<br>of best fits that the m and the C<br>corresponded to that point and the m and<br>the C corresponded to that point I mean<br>this is abstract CU it's really two<br>dimensional IND dimensional space um<br>they're really miles apart though it<br>actually now with really completely<br>different lines so we don't really want<br>that so people then<br>decided um by the way this is called the<br>chiby chip set problem and it takes on<br>this guy's name but he didn't directly<br>Define these sets Okay but he he gave<br>examples of chiby chip<br>sets Okay so what do I look here what do<br>the actual sets look like where every<br>Point has a unique nearest point it says<br>outside the set but that's irrelevant<br>okay just every point this is the<br>property that we wanted for our least<br>squares okay well these sets later<br>became when I say later was named I<br>think about 1958 to<br>1963 two Russian mathematicians named it<br>so it's a long time after this Guy and<br>um well they they said<br>um basically these sets are all convi so<br>sorry if convi sit is a chiby chief sit<br>with the ukian norm if you use strange<br>Norms there really no results at all so<br>the question is what a convict sits look<br>like so well I didn't know I mean of<br>course I did in my PhD in convict sits<br>um so I looked up Wikipedia that's what<br>everybody else I Googled it oh it gives<br>you that picture so what does mean if<br>you take any two points you draw the<br>line segment literally with a pencil<br>between them it stays inside the<br>set okay what something that's not too<br>bad but not convex it looks like that of<br>course if you have any holes in your SE<br>of course you can go from one side to<br>the other and go outside the set out<br>there so there's lots of stuff is<br>excluded you can have<br>corners there's all sorts of things are<br>permitted but you get a sense that<br>they're like one block they're more than<br>connected they're sort of are connected<br>in a nice<br>way um and infinite Dimensions with ukan<br>Norm<br>um the answer is yes and arbitrary um<br>spaces when I say arbitary spaces just<br>with arbitary Norms different ways of<br>measuring distance and the answer is<br>no so this is what I got interested in<br>that this kon's uh hbert space or<br>separable hbert space if you want is it<br>true that you have a chiby chib set and<br>hit face you know so every Point has the<br>nearest Point must have sit be conx no<br>one knows the answer not even know a lot<br>of people<br>tried asplin was this um mathematician<br>unfortunately died quite young um but he<br>proved the following result now as a<br>lect you should never do this you're<br>thinking what the hell is uniquely<br>remoto well you don't know cuz I haven't<br>said but he proved to result said if<br>there is a non-c convict set you know if<br>there is then there should be a uniquely<br>remot<br>set that contains at least two points so<br>what does uniquely remot set well he<br>said if I take any point in the set then<br>there should be a unique okay if you<br>know about compactness it will be<br>farthest point but there should be a<br>unique farthest point there how do I<br>know that's the farthest point if I put<br>the ball around it or the sphere around<br>it the fact that this guy lies inside it<br>and that sphere means every point in<br>this brown shape is less than the<br>distance from P to that bit there it's<br>on the inside of the ball<br>so it's got a unique nearest point and<br>you take another point it's got a unique<br>farthest point<br>there okay that's fine um what does it<br>mean if it's not uniquely well you just<br>take negation if you're a mathematician<br>but it means you got a point like that<br>with there two farthest<br>points okay now these diagrams are not<br>accurate because we're about to see a<br>theorem it says I basically can't draw<br>these things so we're going to use brow<br>fix Point<br>theorem okay<br>Gary T is not here which is good so<br>people will immediately object to this<br>theorem I'm about to give being<br>attributed to Brower because um the form<br>that everybody quotes and uses is due to<br>Brower but actually it was done earlier<br>by other people but in slightly more<br>specific context and it said if you say<br>you stopped show with an O instead of<br>U he would have said that<br>too okay so let's see nonempty convex<br>set um let's not worry about close means<br>it's if you sort of no ST means includ<br>this boundary or something and this guy<br>is continuous the word continuous and<br>undefined but it means if you do small<br>perturbations in x f of x only does<br>small perturbations as well then there's<br>a thing called a fix point which just<br>means it maps to itself it doesn't move<br>it why the cup of tea and I do say tea<br>not coffee could be really weak coffee<br>um so the idea is if you take this spoon<br>here and you stew it around no matter<br>how long you waited and it keeps going<br>around and around there will always be a<br>point in that pot of tea or cup of tea<br>that's in the same place at least one<br>point that's under assumption to you<br>haven't like sliced through the water<br>and done crazy stuff but you know if you<br>gently Stir It Like That there always be<br>one point where that's in the original<br>place that it started from so that's a<br>common application people mention of<br>brow fix Point theorem well here is a<br>theorem um gav asks is there a proof yes<br>there is a<br>proof and finite Dimensions with<br>actually with any Norm there's only<br>uniquely remal sets that exist as<br>Singleton of course every Singleton is<br>uniquely remal because there's only one<br>point that can be possibly your farthest<br>point which is that one point the<br>question is is that all of them well the<br>reason I couldn't draw any was because<br>that is all of them and this this is not<br>the simplest proof by the way you don't<br>really need to use brow fix Point<br>theorem you can use conix analysis and<br>just the existence of a minimum of a<br>complex function on a complex set is all<br>you need but this is the easiest one to<br>describe so since for every X is a<br>unique farthest point let's call it<br>something and because we're<br>mathematicians we used like to put<br>brackets around stuff so it's r<br>ofx that mapping it takes X to its<br>farthest point is continuous so if you<br>move x a little bit R of X only moves a<br>little bit so you got a continuous um<br>function from a compact convex set into<br>a compact convex set so brows fix Point<br>theorem is it's got a fixed point so<br>that is to say the farthest point from X<br>in the set C is<br>itself well that set can't be very big<br>if I take any other point other than x<br>the distance to it will be bigger than<br>zero okay so if the farthest point is<br>itself the set can only consist of the<br>one point okay now if we go back to what<br>um and I'm not going to go back through<br>the slides but if we go back to what<br>asin's result was he said if there's a<br>non-convex uh trib a Sit then there's a<br>uniquely remotable sit with at least two<br>points well these things don't exist so<br>from esence result you actually know<br>with ukian norm and finite Dimensions<br>all tbtf sets are convex well the thing<br>we care about this is not the finite<br>dimensional<br>case because once you if you know the<br>sets convex once you know once it's<br>chibi chiv if it was conx You' get<br>robustness of the of the metric<br>projection or or the the nearest Point<br>map would for free be continuous it<br>wouldn't be an extra assumption you<br>would just get it for free so that's<br>sort of why people CED about<br>this now I'm going to blame Julie for<br>this CU then of my phone okay so what do<br>we<br>got you know I'm going to kick myself<br>out of the class if I haven't finished<br>oh could have gone that way if I haven't<br>finished in time<br>okay so did I simpli assist a simplified<br>version I just gave well I'm not going<br>to say<br>okay some thoughts on teaching well<br>sometimes when you teach you just got to<br>jump in you know you can talk about<br>stuff and play around with stuff and<br>talk and talk but you get nowhere you<br>got to try stuff and be honest about the<br>results and<br>um sometimes you regret what you<br>did<br>so this was after I'd done my<br>PhD you it's about two or three years<br>after I finished my PhD in Queenstown<br>there was um oh yeah<br>okay so this is the bit we will cut out<br>of the recording so incentives to teach<br>well well the university provides lots<br>of them the question is are they the<br>right incentives so you're going for<br>promotion to Professor the first thing<br>you look is how many PhD students should<br>I have does anyone know Jr eight<br>now let's think about this in some<br>professions that's probably fine what<br>does a PhD and pure maths do afterwards<br>apart from become unemployed which is<br>the which is the true for the majority<br>of them that we're training them to be<br>academics so the question is you're in a<br>city state how many mathematicians does<br>every mathematician have to create in<br>order to stay in a city state one okay<br>some are going to produce none so there<br>be some uce<br>more but eight you're that is a bizarre<br>incentive you're encouraging people to<br>do stuff it's not in the best interest<br>of the student it's a fact if we were to<br>go through and track everyone's PhD<br>students how many of them end up in<br>academic jobs very few I mean some do<br>but not many so it's a question of where<br>something we should really be aiming to<br>sit as a<br>goal increasing student enrollments<br>versus getting the student in the right<br>class I'll give a really good<br>example will I<br>so a long time ago let's say a land far<br>far away where no one's been accusative<br>of anyone but suppose you had a h it<br>said if your course graduate course has<br>less than four students you get no<br>credit for teaching but if it has five<br>then you get full credit that's a land<br>far far<br>away is it<br>so you're now got three people in your<br>class and it's like January there's<br>still lots of time to contact students<br>and convince them to do functional<br>analysis for<br>example should you do it well for you<br>personally it would be a really good<br>idea to do it but is it best for the<br>student well it may be or it may not but<br>that isn't what people are looking at<br>they're trying to get the numbers loc<br>it's not affecting the University<br>numbers they're already enrolled in a<br>program within the university it's not<br>affecting the faculty numbers it's just<br>affecting your own personal numbers but<br>the university is encouraging you to get<br>up to four or five students or whatever<br>the number is that they say so this<br>really changes people advice I remember<br>in this land far far away when no one<br>has a name that we can<br>remember I almost said we<br>so somebody talked to some R students<br>who had done meths in the<br>past in fact I can see some people<br>probably even know who I'm talking about<br>um because they've been just land far<br>far away and they convinced them to do<br>some graduate courses in P maths that<br>might have been the best thing for the<br>student but it probably wasn't it was<br>really about meeting these constraints<br>that the university puts Upon<br>Us popularity versus pushing students<br>outside the comfort zone now put up your<br>put up your hand if I push you outside<br>your comfort<br>zone oh good some people<br>didn't okay so my viewers I'm not there<br>to be your friend I'm there to teach you<br>maths full<br>stop okay I don't care if you like me or<br>not it's like the other staff members in<br>the domest department I don't care if<br>they like me my<br>job<br>which is just as well but so my my job<br>is I just remember I said to Alex I only<br>one joke but my job is to teach okay and<br>it's different it's like when you're a<br>parent you're not the friend of your<br>children you're not I me of course you<br>love them and you want what's best<br>that's all you want same when you teach<br>so I'm not always giving the students<br>reassurance of if it's not the best<br>thing for them so I did a c evaluation<br>early on and of course probably my C<br>evaluations aren't good in fact one year<br>back in the days of sisle I actually<br>organized have um wasn't set what do<br>they call them Jaws the all course<br>evaluation I did one after the exam I<br>just set it up myself and in that I got<br>really high approval but the actual one<br>that was done in week six or week seven<br>or whatever I had like 70% approval<br>actually but it wasn't because my goal<br>isn't to get high approval in the middle<br>of the course actually it was not my<br>goal to get high approval at the end of<br>the course actually my my goal was to<br>teach people math but what I believe<br>happened I can't prove it you never can<br>on education was that when people<br>actually saw the ex exam it wasn't as<br>hard as they<br>thought but students say that to me all<br>the time they say oh did you ease up in<br>the exam just no it's it's just no<br>harder than what you've been<br>doing okay keeping students happy versus<br>challenging them and permitting them to<br>fail before they succeed now this and<br>the current climate is dangerous you get<br>students to fail they might leave you<br>might be worried about how it<br>looks but is it really best in the long<br>run<br>certainly I can't imagine playing<br>football at my age any I probably die<br>but I played football for many years and<br>January comes and you know you're in<br> you're not going to see a football<br>for a long time you're going to be<br>running and running and running and<br>doing shuttles and more running and more<br>running but then later on in the season<br>when you need your Fitness you've got it<br>we need to adopt more in my modest<br>opinion more this approach we need to<br>look to see what the students really<br>need to be doing and do it without fear<br>of<br>consequences it's difficult I mean I'm<br>not saying this is easy I'm not even<br>saying people should do<br>this I tried to do this though<br>I really try to do what's best for<br>students I don't really care what's best<br>for<br>me okay a more recent thing so why do<br>students attend is it good if they<br>attend oh actually it reminds something<br>Andrew talk said before this talk<br>started okay student attendance should<br>we force them to come to class is<br>attending actually year a good<br>thing well the vertic a little bit out<br>on this I think a long time ago like<br>when I was a student I had to go to<br>lectures there were no recordings there<br>were no printed course notes remember I<br>didn't take notes I had to be there so<br>if I didn't go there would really<br>negative<br>consequences nowadays it's recorded<br>there's online books there's all sorts<br>of stuff you can still go to the<br>tutorials you still get to see the<br>assignments you still get to do the<br>tutorials it's really not clear if<br>attending in the class is actually<br>corresponds to engagement engagement you<br>can't really measure it's it's it's like<br>quantum mechanics soon as you're trying<br>to measure it you perturb the system and<br>you know you've lost whatever you're<br>trying to actually<br>measure I mean it's a difficulty of<br>Education Theory it's it's and it's<br>there's no easy solution to<br>it uh students being active versus<br>learning so this is my classic PQ<br>probably if they're learning they're<br>active even if it's only mentally okay<br>so q r p is true but do p r q so you<br>could be jumping up and down star jumps<br>and all sorts of you know writing on the<br>Blackboard and but whether you're<br>actually learning that's another matter<br>all together you may or may not be<br>learning but it's not guaranteed<br>activity in itself is not actually<br>engaging in the<br>material okay I'm not saying it's easy<br>to distinguish some things that I like<br>to be mindful of teaching<br>way so you want to teach in a way that<br>makes you feel good it's<br>natural but it may not be the best way<br>to teach people love it when students<br>come to their class and makes them feel<br>good they make jokes sometimes and you<br>laughs except when I make jokes I don't<br>laugh anyway okay so being honest in all<br>assessments it's so easy to cut Corners<br>you're aware the class isn't really<br>following what you're doing so you<br>readjust the assessment so they do well<br>anyway no one knows the students sure as<br>hell don't know you know no one outside<br>your course knows there's a real<br>encouragement in the system to do that<br>ultimately the students disadvantage<br>when they go to the next course now I<br>don't look what's best for the<br>University I don't look what's best for<br>the faculty or the department actually<br>ultimately we're responsible to the<br>society that we live in so when I teach<br>I'm trying to provide students that<br>Society might find<br>useful sometimes that's in keeping with<br>what the university wants and the<br>department and the faculty but not<br>always sometimes there slightly<br>different things but ultimately I think<br>we're responsible tax payers pay our<br>salary okay it's not the university they<br>just distribute the money oh and the<br>students pay as well okay so what do I<br>teaching not a lot um I'm not sure I'm<br>much better at teaching than when I<br>first taught one 121 oh it's different<br>so when I first taught to one I used to<br>make a lot of jokes I was basically a<br>student myself I was<br>um 20 years old or 21 years old so know<br>that so I was basically the same age as<br>a students but it was different I think<br>a lot more about my teaching so maybe<br>I'm not as entertaining in fact I'm<br>probably not entertaining at all but um<br>I do think a lot so I reflect I reflect<br>and I try to be humble and honest and<br>it's hard I got this a student that did<br>15 with me in 2018 which was a bit of a<br>train wreck of a course um when I was<br>applying for promotion I asked them to<br>give me an honest evaluation what he<br>thought of my teaching in<br>2018 some of was good I mean he he was<br>actually one of the few successful<br>students out of the course but he said<br>stuff that was really quite a learning<br>experience for me so you know you learn<br>more from your fails and your wins I<br>guess um yeah repeat reflect and<br>hopefully learn something from<br>it<br>um do what is right not what is easy<br>that's not easy to do you got to do it<br>within yourself there's no exteral<br>reward for doing the right thing try to<br>be honest with students in every<br>possible way I remember when they first<br>said there used to be a thing where you<br>you could post exam results through<br>cesil and then canvas where students<br>never got to see it until it came out on<br>SSO and I<br>remember uh my partner was then I think<br>associate Dean or something when they<br>changed over where you have to make it<br>public and everybody was scared saying<br>oh my God students are seeing what all<br>our internal calculations but then I<br>thought about it we've got nothing to<br>hide we're not doing anything dishonest<br>let's be just completely honest you know<br>if we moderate just tell them if we<br>scale which is slightly different to<br>moderation just tell them tell them how<br>we Mark if they find a mistake don't be<br>defensive just say that's a mistake or<br>do a change of grade form we just have<br>to be open and honest we we're honest<br>people we got nothing to<br>hide um the last one is this leads to<br>student dis satisfaction so a lot of<br>it's just<br>miscommunications students have a<br>different perception of what the purpose<br>of the course is and you can tell them<br>week oh my god when you get to my age<br>you lose your<br>concentration but it's not good enough<br>okay cuz they forget you have to re<br>reinforce and reinforce what you want is<br>different to what they want so what they<br>want is a high grade okay what you want<br>is for them to learn there's some<br>overlap but it's really quite distinct<br>outcomes and you have to say that well<br>actually if you're teaching a service<br>course it's hard to convince them they<br>should learn mathematics because what<br>they really want is to get a high grade<br>and G unfortunately it's not much I can<br>say you can do about those guys but for<br>people want to ma major in meths you can<br>say well you might get through this<br>course with an a class but it's not<br>going to help you much next year and<br>that's true so a Jr what the way they<br>should do the set of valuations it's the<br>year after they did the course so when<br>I'm teaching 120 and 130 they should<br>start monitoring the students in 250<br>about what they thought about 120 and<br>130 then and also measuring their grades<br>because there are studies that show<br>courses very high evaluations often the<br>students do poorly in the next course<br>and there's several possible reasons for<br>that one is maybe the students over<br>confidence one is maybe the teacher<br>changed he he was trying to optimize the<br>set<br>evaluations by the way what wasn't done<br>in Oakland uh see said try to do what's<br>best for the students regardless of well<br>I'm not going to say any more than that<br>and oh my God I'm overtime got to shoot<br>myself okay so that's<br>it<br>okay</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
