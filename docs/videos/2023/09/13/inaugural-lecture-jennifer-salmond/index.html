John hosking I'm<br>dean of science here at the University<br>of Auckland it's my great pleasure to<br>welcome you to the inaugural letter<br>lecture of Professor Jennifer salmon<br>as Jenny was promoted in the end of 2020<br>this lecture has been a long time coming<br>due to covert lockdowns but it is all<br>more welcome for it<br>Jenny completed an MA in geography at<br>Oxford and MSC in meteorology and<br>applied climatology at Birmingham and a<br>PhD in geography at British Columbia<br>before taking positions at UBC in<br>Birmingham<br>she then moved in to Auckland in 2007<br>where while juggling a new family she<br>has become an important member of the<br>environment school including leading the<br>geography discipline<br>Jenny's primary area of research is<br>atmospheric pollution<br>her work is notable for the<br>technological and methodological<br>advances that it makes and this is<br>reflected in her numerous invitations to<br>join International research consortia<br>and to give funded talks internationally<br>she's a prolific grant winner try saying<br>that uh<br>again having landed over 15 million<br>dollars of funding and she's a<br>productive researcher with more than 90<br>Publications<br>his citation record shows the strong<br>impact of her work in Academia while her<br>work as a policy advisor consultant and<br>expert witness demonstrates equivalent<br>societal impact<br>it's perhaps sad that a pollution<br>scientist is in so much demand<br>but I am thankful that there is someone<br>of Jenny's stature to meet that demand<br>Ginny's also an excellent educator well<br>received by students and with an<br>impressive list of successful curriculum<br>reforms and a fellowship from the UK<br>higher education Academy evidencing her<br>impact<br>she's also an excellent research<br>supervisor having supervised close to 50<br>Masters and PhD students to completion<br>to complete her record as a well-rounded<br>academic Ginny is an excellent<br>University citizen contributing in many<br>service roles at School faculty and<br>University level as well as to her<br>discipline internationally via editorial<br>board and Advisory Board memberships<br>that she has been promoted to Professor<br>comes as no surprise to those of us who<br>have seen her career blossom<br>despite being such a fine and upstanding<br>academic Ginny is going to talk tonight<br>about naughtiness<br>specifically doing science in a naughty<br>to begin I'd like to invite my daughter<br>now<br>foreign<br>tail<br>oh thank you so much for coming it's<br>amazing to see so many people in a room<br>and I think it's been since pre-covered<br>that I've had the opportunity to talk to<br>so many people at once and whilst it's<br>all very special it's also a little bit<br>daunting so please bear with me as I<br>so geographers have long sought to make<br>sense of the complex ecosocial worlds in<br>which we live<br>and if we look back to the early<br>pioneers of geomorphology we saw our<br>heroes sitting on landscapes describing<br>and painting pictures with their words<br>what they thought the underlying<br>processes might be doing<br>from that point through to other the<br>clever date escapes and the underlying<br>complex models that we create today<br>field observation and measurement has<br>been a fundamental part of geography<br>especially physical geography<br>and of course our measurements form the<br>building blocks of the models that we<br>like to create in our attempts to<br>predict and control or at least tame the<br>worlds around us<br>so why a naughty world<br>the term a naughty world was first<br>coined to my knowledge by Barbara<br>Kennedy in 1969<br>now Barbara Kennedy was one of the few<br>female lecturers that I had at the<br>University of Oxford<br>and she was responding to a period when<br>the popularity of Earth system science<br>was really running a riot<br>in her first line of her paper she's she<br>says the Hampshire Basin fails to<br>perform<br>which of course is a cheeky way of<br>actually flipping around the idea that<br>the models themselves aren't working<br>and what she was really trying to do in<br>that paper was to emphasize the role of<br>people in place of individuality over<br>the role of generalization and Universal<br>principles which Earth system science<br>sought really to promote and predict<br>now Barbara like all good teachers<br>sought to practice what she preached and<br>although I never had the joy of going on<br>a field trip with her I preferred fair<br>weather field work and the rivers guys<br>went out in the rain<br>so I never went with her but Legend had<br>it that when she went out to study her<br>river systems she would unexpectedly<br>launch herself straight into the river<br>fully closed with a tape measure<br>declaring that Rivers had to be<br>experienced as well as measured and<br>turning around and expecting all her<br>students to do the same thing can you<br>perhaps hearing her words over the years<br>echoing my head I too have sought to<br>have a field-based research program<br>and the photo that I've chosen for this<br>inaugural I think really reflects for me<br>some of the key parts or key components<br>of field science<br>the eagle-eyed among you will have<br>spotted that the photo is dated 1997.<br>this was the first year of my PhD pilot<br>studies for um for for the the PHD that<br>I was conducting at the University of<br>British Columbia<br>and no we're not popping large balloons<br>in a graveyard although we are working<br>in a graveyard because it turns out if<br>you want to fly a large helium balloon<br>which you can't actually see in this<br>photo a 15 meter cubed helium balloon<br>you need a nice big space in the city<br>what we're actually doing is marking the<br>line with large balloons as an aircraft<br>safety protocol so the balloon itself<br>isn't doesn't become a hazard in the<br>atmosphere it goes up about a kilometer<br>into the atmosphere what you can see in<br>the photograph is by supervisor Ian<br>McKendree and his little boy<br>and you can see that the slow pace of<br>the science the data was recorded line<br>by line onto a computer which we sat and<br>watched and it all ended up on a floppy<br>three-inch disc<br>the little boy in the photo is now what<br>by Daughter age three termed to be a<br>useful doctor not like you mummy<br>um is now a doctor of medicine at the<br>University at the hospital in Toronto<br>so the picture for me sums up the field<br>work of the time<br>now these types of instruments were<br>considered state of the art they no<br>longer are and my own PhD students have<br>an instrument which sits on the roof and<br>brings back the same amount of data<br>actually no that's not true a lot more<br>data in fact they can have profiles<br>going twice as high as my original<br>profile and they can have several times<br>in a minute what we could achieve over<br>the course of an hour<br>such data is dumped onto a desktop<br>computer which periodically overflows<br>and they don't sit there watching the<br>data come in<br>so clearly we've seen some very fairly<br>radical changes not only in the data we<br>collect but in the types of data that<br>so what I want to do today is to think<br>about the changes that we've seen that<br>I've seen over the course of the 25<br>years since this photo was taken and see<br>what kind of uh advances sell and to<br>celebrate those advances to look maybe<br>two of the things that we've lost as<br>part of this process and where we might<br>go in the future as geographers working<br>so while we've seen some step changes in<br>the research instruments that we use to<br>look at the three-dimensional<br>characteristics of the atmosphere<br>perhaps some of the most dramatic<br>changes that we've seen over the last 25<br>years is actually in the small cheap<br>portable robust and reliable low-cost<br>sensors which are now available for<br>measuring surface air quality or for<br>carrying around with you or perhaps even<br>for putting on balloons should you so<br>desire but these instruments are now<br>available and they're changing who it<br>has access to the data and they're<br>changing who can collect the data too so<br>once collecting air quality data was<br>just in the hands of the regulatory<br>science regulatory authorities and<br>research scientists usually well-funded<br>ones now it's possible as end users or<br>citizen scientists to get some really<br>good data in your home or perhaps even<br>transition really marked a new era in<br>the availability of air quality data and<br>when we combine that with new techniques<br>for storing data Telemetry and of course<br>modeling we suddenly have a condition<br>where we are in a position where we can<br>make some really big changes in the way<br>we process data the way we have the<br>information in front of us and we can<br>start thinking about new ways to analyze<br>air quality<br>indeed about halfway through my 25-year<br>period so around about 2013 Snyder and<br>others said conditions in a ripe now for<br>a paradigm change in air quality science<br>we now have all the tools that we need<br>but somehow we haven't seen those step<br>changes<br>we've got the new toys in the toolbox<br>we've got a wealth of data coming into<br>us but this new technology seems yet to<br>deliver on its promise of improved air<br>quality on its promise of improved<br>understanding of the worlds around us<br>indeed the World Health Authority said<br>in 2022 between four and nine million<br>people worldwide die from exposure to<br>air pollution well that doesn't sound<br>like a science that's in a healthy state<br>or a science that's benefited from a<br>paradigm change<br>indeed it sounds like a science it<br>doesn't really know what's going on<br>between four and nine million people<br>well that seems like a very big error<br>so what I'm going to do today is to try<br>and ask the question why why have we not<br>seen this step change in our ability to<br>manage the naughty or the complex worlds<br>that are around us what do we need to do<br>to convert the the new technologies and<br>the knowledge that we're collecting into<br>something perhaps that is more useful<br>well to do this I'm going to look at the<br>research or some of the research doing<br>why it's not all of it some of the<br>research that we've done over the last<br>25 years and we're going to look at it<br>in a new light and ask this time<br>how does the changing technology affect<br>the questions that we chose to ask how<br>we frame the problem<br>who we worked with and why we did those<br>that kind of research<br>I'm also going to think about the data<br>that we chose to collect what did we<br>measure and why when and where did we<br>make our measurements what data did we<br>include and exclude in our analysis<br>and what tools did we analyze the data<br>with<br>because it turns out that a lot of those<br>questions actually are very important in<br>determining the types of knowledge that<br>we produce<br>as we go along I'm also going to reflect<br>on some of the institutional and<br>disciplinary context of those decisions<br>where did the funding come from what was<br>the driver for the Publications what<br>kind of Publications were accepted and<br>which ones were rejected<br>and that of course also affects the<br>types of knowledge we produced<br>and then I'm going to try and ask<br>perhaps what is a very scary question<br>for air quality scientists<br>is an improved numerical mirror which is<br>essentially what a datascape is of the<br>worlds around us actually going to<br>improve our understanding of the<br>processes which shape it<br>and can it lead us to better<br>Environmental Management<br>now that's scary because it means that<br>science may not be the answer to the<br>questions that we're looking for when we<br>now to do this I'm going to draw on a<br>critical physical geography framework<br>now critical physical geography also<br>arose in the middle of my 25-year period<br>largely championed by Rebecca Love she's<br>someone who has been thinking about<br>these issues perhaps building on some of<br>the work from Barbara Kennedy and others<br>through from the 2000s onwards<br>and what critical physical geography<br>argues is that our worlds are so<br>complicated now that it's very difficult<br>to identify natural processes from<br>cultural processes if you like our<br>worlds or become totally ecosocial<br>and as a result we need eco-social<br>processes and and Frameworks to be in<br>order to analyze them<br>critical physical geography also argues<br>for the importance of thinking about who<br>is producing the knowledge who has the<br>authority to speak what data do we<br>collect and why and finally critical<br>physical geography also places emphasis<br>on recognizing the impact both intended<br>and unintended of the research that we<br>do<br>so just a small aim for the next<br>25 minutes<br>so I'm going to begin by asking why do<br>we need air pollution data now if we<br>think about the users of air pollution<br>data we've got our regulatory<br>authorities and it's actually in many<br>countries a legal requirement to measure<br>air quality and to compare it to<br>thresholds<br>regulatory scientists are also<br>interested in documenting change to work<br>out whether the policy changes have<br>actually resulted in any Improvement<br>as research scientists we're interested<br>in measuring air pollution to define the<br>problem as some pollutions are easy to<br>see or to smell other pollutions not so<br>much take carbon monoxide for example<br>so there's an element of using data to<br>make the invisible visible<br>as research scientists we're also<br>interested in improving our<br>understanding of the causes and<br>consequences of air pollution to try and<br>work out which changes we might need to<br>make the costs economic and socially<br>perhaps in order to improve our<br>environment<br>we build and run models for prediction<br>or mitigation<br>and we can run early warning systems or<br>provide the real data for end users such<br>as citizen scientists<br>but if you like all three of those user<br>groups policy makers the research<br>scientists and the individuals using the<br>data are using it to make decisions<br>policy makers how are we going to<br>control our air quality research<br>scientists what kind of data we can<br>collect and how do the systems work and<br>then of course our citizens how do we<br>change our Behavior either to avoid the<br>impacts of air pollution or how do we<br>change our Behavior to mitigate that air<br>so we can see this emphasis on<br>collecting good data<br>so what does good atmospheric data look<br>like<br>well if we're going to have a notion of<br>good data and poor data then perhaps<br>it's important to think about it in a<br>scientific context<br>so good data collection by which I mean<br>scientific data comes from measurement<br>the early geomorphologists and<br>Atmospheric scientists who painted<br>pictures of the Landscapes or the<br>atmosphere found that it was quite<br>frustrating in terms of telling a story<br>when everyone saw the story slightly<br>differently<br>so in order to get a data that was more<br>useful they thought they needed to have<br>objective data so it was a repeatable<br>measurement or a neutral observation so<br>it didn't matter who was doing the<br>measurement or who was observing the<br>environment we'd all see it in the same<br>way<br>now in order to achieve that you have to<br>have some rules as to how to make your<br>measurements and that is an entirely<br>different lecture but you have to agree<br>on your rules and then you have to have<br>precise and accurate data which<br>represents or mirrors the thing that<br>you're trying to study<br>what happens to the data well then it<br>gets classified used in ordering perhaps<br>or in modeling the world around us and<br>we use it to test ideas and the goal for<br>good scientific data is generalizable<br>rules or Universal principles<br>so this is still thinking about data in<br>a scientific sense<br>thinking too about the tools of the<br>trade well these are continually<br>changing but generally we have a problem<br>in that you can either measure well in<br>time or you can measure way well in<br>space and that becomes a problem when<br>you're thinking about environmental<br>problems like air pollution<br>and pretty much any way we go about<br>generating data all forms of data have<br>so when we come to think about data<br>collection in an environmental comp<br>context especially in a complex world we<br>see we hit a number of problems when we<br>try and collect good data in a<br>scientific context<br>for example it's very difficult to agree<br>on where to make measurements or when or<br>which tools to use or which measurements<br>are representative what data are real<br>and what are the spikes caused by an<br>electronic signal in the system<br>and it matters who made the who makes<br>the measurements not only do we see the<br>world differently but we might use these<br>instruments differently<br>and it really matters why the<br>measurements were made in the first<br>place are we collecting data for<br>regulatory purposes or are we collecting<br>data to answer some science questions<br>so you can see immediately this idea of<br>a neutral objective data collection<br>process doesn't really exist it's highly<br>subjective it's just that all those<br>decisions get hidden behind the number<br>that we end up getting collecting at the<br>end of the day<br>this is the work that King and tadaki<br>call the Little P or Pollock Little P<br>politics of data collection and it's<br>important<br>so we started our journey in the 1990s<br>and at that time we could argue that the<br>environmental scientists were feeling<br>quite frustrated and the atmospheric<br>scientists among them had the same<br>problem<br>walking down the corridors my co-phd<br>students and I were saying oh if only we<br>had more data from this site or that<br>time period or we could measure at this<br>scale and that scale and we could<br>measure this variable and that variable<br>then we'd be able to answer the question<br>then we'd answer the pro we answer the<br>process better we'd understand it better<br>we could model it better we'd have more<br>data for input and validation we'd<br>finally achieve the panicoa of<br>predicting managing and controlling the<br>systems we studied<br>but we were limited we were limited<br>financially in terms of resources and we<br>were limited by collecting either high<br>resolution data and time<br>so looking then at the atmospheric data<br>collection there were really two key<br>groups in the 90s one was this<br>regulatory monitoring system and the<br>other was the academic research groups<br>and Regulatory monitoring really<br>developed to be highly controlled we had<br>systems that were located in temperature<br>controlled cabins they were all<br>calibrated in the same way they're all<br>routinely calibrated pretty much every<br>day some for some pollutants we had<br>alley data you had no choice about what<br>height you were measuring and the aim<br>was was really threshold comparison for<br>legal purposes so every single rule had<br>to be followed<br>these measurements were Point<br>measurements and they were long term and<br>in the 90s we saw the first air quality<br>monitoring networks being set up in New<br>Zealand and elsewhere we saw air quality<br>monitoring networks becoming established<br>and adding more stations<br>so the academic research community that<br>I entered in the 90s was partly located<br>in atmospheric sciences and partly<br>located in geography<br>and depending on your maths and physics<br>capability you generally chose one or<br>the other departments I ended up in the<br>geography Department<br>and the research in the 90s was lightly<br>case study approaches and they were<br>trying to think about the<br>three-dimensional characteristics of the<br>atmosphere and a lot of the research<br>required expensive toys even the system<br>the balloon system that I showed you<br>required a significant amount of<br>investment<br>we were just starting to be able to<br>measure at higher temporal resolutions<br>but most of the work was being done as<br>part of large multinational and<br>well-organized field campaigns that took<br>place over the course of two or three<br>months<br>the emphasis was generally on<br>identifying the natural processes that<br>determine dispose dispersion and they<br>were really looking at the under the<br>ideal conditions so we were narrowing<br>things down to a controlled set of<br>conditions as far as was possible within<br>so my first case study is actually the<br>work that I did for my PhD<br>now I was a fully funded PhD student I<br>arrived in the department with funding<br>to do field work and I was lucky enough<br>to have a supervisor who also had<br>funding for an unspecified purpose<br>and over the course of the first which<br>we don't get today I thought over the<br>course of<br>um the first year that I was there I<br>became really curious about the spikes<br>in Ozone concentration which I observed<br>at night now ozone is a secondary<br>pollutant so it's formed in the<br>atmosphere and it's only supposed to be<br>able to be formed during the day and<br>that's the result of some complex<br>chemistry that David can explain right<br>and I would just say it's complex<br>chemistry for the purposes of today so<br>but ozone can't be formed at night and<br>yet we were seeing under some random<br>apparently conditions spikes at night<br>and we weren't the only people who were<br>observing this but to see it you had to<br>look at individual night's worth of data<br>because if you averaged over several<br>nights they disappeared they happened<br>randomly in terms of when they occurred<br>they happened in different magnitudes<br>but they were definitely there and as<br>far as we could make out they were real<br>but we couldn't see any process that<br>connected it to advection<br>and as far as we knew the concentration<br>the residual layer was supposed to be<br>pretty low and pretty homogeneous so why<br>were we seeing these spikes in<br>concentration<br>so as part of my pilot work we sat in in<br>this graveyard in in Vancouver and we<br>ran our balloons up and down and the<br>beauty of this work is you can only do<br>it on a sunny day so you had it and you<br>had these glorious sunny days and we sat<br>out and we enjoyed the sunshine except<br>for I had to do the work at night which<br>probably wasn't quite the right way<br>around for me but you know we tried and<br>we had a good time and we watched the<br>data come in and we looked for these<br>spikes and all summer long and we didn't<br>see a single one<br>and at this point I was ready to say<br>hang on a minute guys this is the wrong<br>project for me<br>but my supervisor convinced me to keep<br>trying<br>and so the following year for my actual<br>first field campaign we went up the<br>valley a bit further and this time we<br>did our work in a naval a base that was<br>located pretty much in the center of the<br>lower Fraser Valley<br>partly the relocation was to move us<br>away from the Vancouver International<br>airspace as the previous year we'd had a<br>little bit of an accident of our balloon<br>line that then shot the balloon up into<br>the airspace and again my children who<br>tell me that the 1990s was the Dark Ages<br>and before mobile phones it wasn't quite<br>before mobile phones because I remember<br>having a brick in my hand and calling<br>the airport authority to say I've lost<br>my balloon in your airspace which was<br>not something you really want to repeat<br>so we moved to the naval base and this<br>was where<br>um we actually were much more successful<br>in studying these ozone events and what<br>we saw For the First Time by studying in<br>three dimensions was that ozone<br>concentrations in the residual layer<br>were variable and we got these periods<br>where we had advection happening but it<br>was happening above the surface and so<br>we could see this ozone above the<br>surface but with our tethered balloons<br>which were going up and down over the<br>course of an hour we couldn't actually<br>see the ozone being connected from above<br>the surface down to the ground<br>so luckily at the same time we've we had<br>really gone at it with every single tool<br>we had we had some turbulence<br>instruments set up behind us and we were<br>looking to see whether the high<br>frequency analysis so now 21 times a<br>second so I started to get to what I<br>thought might be big data a lot of data<br>that's for sure and we were looking to<br>see whether we could see any of this<br>turbulent mixing that might happen at<br>night<br>now of course we were looking on the<br>beautiful still calm conditions I'm not<br>really expecting to find turbulence at<br>night because turbulence doesn't happen<br>when it's very stable and that was the<br>conditions we were looking at<br>but again what we found is if we looked<br>at the data itself rather than averaging<br>it we actually looked at the data we<br>could see the bursts of turbulent<br>activity and you could match these<br>bursts of turbulent activity with<br>changes in Ozone concentration<br>and lo and behold they happened at the<br>same time so we're starting to see by<br>looking at individual bits of data this<br>process that was happening that coupled<br>the Air Above Down to the surface<br>the problem was that all the theory said<br>there wasn't turbulence in the very<br>stable nocturnal boundary layer and all<br>the theory said in order to be able to<br>calculate the turbulent flux you had to<br>have a stationary turbulence signal and<br>you can see quite clearly this is<br>intermittent and not stationary so we<br>then had to come up with a whole series<br>of new tools to calculate the fluxes to<br>be able to prove that we had this<br>process operating<br>so it turned out that the very stable<br>nocturnal boundary layer was also quite<br>naughty<br>where I moved to thinking about<br>turbulence in more detail I was quite<br>captured by this idea that we could<br>generate so much to so much data and<br>that we could go up into the atmosphere<br>and look at these processes<br>and as during this period I was working<br>partly as an independent scientist at<br>the University of Birmingham and partly<br>as a postdoc for Tim Oak at the<br>University of British Columbia and as a<br>result I then had the opportunity to<br>take part in three large field campaigns<br>in urban areas the first one in<br>Marseille the second one in Basel and<br>the third one in Toulouse<br>and what we found was with these new<br>toys these were the first time these<br>instruments could have been used in an<br>urban area they were only just on the<br>market and they were quite fun to use<br>not only could we get masses of data but<br>if we went up high enough we could get<br>similar results to what people were<br>observing over tree canopies and again<br>with a bit of tweaking of the methods we<br>could come up with new ways of thinking<br>about how to calculate fluxes over urban<br>areas and what they meant<br>so as part of this work we learned about<br>the importance of quantifying Transport<br>differences from the the heat can the<br>street Canyon itself and from the roof<br>they behave quite differently they're<br>quite different turbulent signals and we<br>could see for the first time pollutant<br>being vented from the street level up<br>into the urban atmosphere at night<br>now the urban nocturnal atmosphere is<br>possibly even more naughty than the<br>stable Urban atmosphere the stable rural<br>atmosphere and so we had to do some<br>tweaking again with the theory<br>and as part of that we decided that<br>actually what we really needed to do was<br>to get a spatial measurement rather than<br>a point measurement so we could just<br>measure what the the flux look like over<br>the rooftop we would see a different<br>signal to if we pointed our uh<br>instrument looking across the top of the<br>street Canyon<br>now this this has never been done before<br>either and this is using some equipment<br>which hadn't been used in an urban<br>boundary layer as well<br>and it's interesting to think about the<br>implications of that research which<br>actually didn't work<br>but in 2005 if we look at the overall<br>publication which essentially just<br>introduced the field work that we did as<br>a team an international team it was<br>published soon after the the field<br>campaign and it got over the course of<br>20 odd years I guess we've had 450<br>citations of a paper which essentially<br>says this is what we did we set up a<br>flux Tower we measured it this is what<br>we saw<br>then Martius and I who were working on<br>how we could use these instruments in an<br>urban area and how you might line it up<br>and what kind of cereal you might use we<br>published a paper it took us much longer<br>but we got there because we could we<br>could we figured out how you could use<br>them we got 67 citations<br>and then finally when we try to actually<br>work out whether you could compare the<br>flux from the roof or the flat with the<br>flux from the canyon and said actually<br>no you can't we haven't got the right<br>Tools in fact we stated it's possible<br>that the site and measurement challenges<br>are too great to answer the question<br>posed and we also suggested it might be<br>helpful to study idealized cases and<br>whatever which we could have more<br>experimental control we only got 21<br>citations and that paper cost us a lot<br>more in terms of what we were trying to<br>Wrangle out of the data so a negative<br>answer doesn't always get you where you<br>want to be as a scientist even though<br>it's actually really important the<br>interesting thing also about that<br>research is even though we couldn't<br>measure it the modelers took it and it's<br>now forms the basis of the urban air<br>mixed results<br>from 2007 to 2015 I moved away from the<br>flux measurements partly because I moved<br>countries and came here and started<br>thinking about different ideas and<br>around about this time it was also the<br>early days of the low-cost sensors and<br>the low-cost sensor analysis and they<br>liked perhaps these are the years I like<br>to call my chaos years not least because<br>they were when my children were young I<br>was working part-time and these low-cost<br>sensors gave me ever such a lot of gray<br>hair<br>so the local sensors really I think<br>arose out of a variety of groups needing<br>to have more spatial data about what's<br>happening at the surface they're<br>recognizing that air quality is actually<br>way more complex spatially and<br>temporarily than we thought it's hard to<br>distinguish between different sources<br>working out the health relationship is<br>really challenging and we just needed<br>more information about what was<br>happening at the surface we're trying to<br>Grapple with what people were being<br>exposed to and when they were being<br>exposed to it so there's a need for<br>mobile sensors and there was a need for<br>much higher density<br>high resolution temporal data but also<br>high resolution spatial data and what<br>these low-cost census teas was this<br>ability to have both high resolution<br>time data and high resolution spatial<br>data which seemed to be what we needed<br>so it started off I had two sort of<br>aspects of research going on at the time<br>the first was thinking about portable<br>air quality monitoring technology<br>and different pollutants are easier to<br>measure using cheap equipment than<br>um so somewhere easier than others and<br>the the first cab off the rank if you<br>like were these Langan carbon monoxide<br>monitors which many of my students will<br>have very fond memories of I'm sure<br>now these these instruments we<br>discovered you could put on cars you<br>could put them in buses<br>um here we've got uh one of my higher<br>risk taking students uh using using<br>these on the bicycle<br>um another student who walked around<br>town looking at difference between uh<br>the exposure you got as an adult<br>compared to what you might see in a push<br>chair<br>and we did a lot of work especially work<br>with newer<br>um and this is work that Kim and I did<br>over the course of many years and really<br>the access to multiple low-cost sensors<br>spot all kinds of new different types of<br>projects and one of the things we were<br>really lucky to have early on was 13 of<br>these carbon monoxide sensors and that<br>meant that we could send an instrument<br>home with each of my 713 class and tell<br>them to measure their exposure as They<br>Carried around over the course of their<br>week and what we found was that actually<br>individuals were exposed to very<br>different concentrations of pollutants<br>depending on what they did<br>other students rode buses and were able<br>to show for the first time where the<br>spikes in air pollution occurred they<br>were to show different results about<br>which parts of the city were more<br>polluted than others<br>but the types of projects that we were<br>able to do with these low-cost sensors<br>were really quite different from any of<br>the previous work that we'd done the<br>low-cost sensors themselves whilst we um<br>correlated them with with them with with<br>themselves we didn't really spend a lot<br>of time correlating them with the um<br>actual regulatory style instruments<br>and when we looked at studies around the<br>world that have kicked off about all<br>about the same time in the early 2010s a<br>little bit before a little bit after you<br>can see that although there's been<br>absolute wealth of research there's<br>little consistency in the methodology<br>so we've got a variety of different<br>instruments that are being used in each<br>of the instruments are slightly<br>different the location of the study<br>isn't controlled no one really says for<br>example ambassadors where on the bus<br>they were sitting what type of bus or<br>whether the windows were open<br>how the data were averaged or the data<br>quality controls aren't always specified<br>the length of the trip the number of<br>repetitions the time of the day and you<br>can see it goes on that the control over<br>the type of experiment that was<br>undertaken and then our willingness to<br>compare what's happening between studies<br>was kind of there was a mismatch there<br>between what we were trying to do<br>and one of the things we really noticed<br>is in this period is that as we're<br>producing more and more numbers they all<br>appear to be the same actually they're<br>hiding a huge amount of variability in<br>how we collect the data so the numbers<br>are appearing and they all look the same<br>but actually what they hide is now<br>changed completely so when we had field<br>studies at the beginning it was all very<br>controlled we're all doing it the same<br>way or reporting it the same way and<br>that's suddenly we've got a lot more<br>data coming in but the thing that's<br>hiding underneath has changed quite<br>significantly<br>so that was the mobile work that we did<br>the other work that we've done has been<br>looking more at the the use of these<br>low-cost sensors in as a fixed sensor<br>and really this took off from 2016<br>onwards<br>and you can see if you look at the<br>literature now looking back that from<br>2016 onwards there actually seems to be<br>a a bifurcation but it's different to<br>the one that we had before where we had<br>the regulatory authorities and the<br>research driven scientists now we have<br>research driven scientists and a<br>different group of users these are the<br>commercial users and they often coincide<br>with citizen scientists<br>so I'm going to look first of all of the<br>types of research that the research<br>scientists are doing with the low-cost<br>sensors and then we can compare that<br>with what the commercial NGO groups are<br>so when we're working with low-cost<br>sensors we work very hard and with a<br>number of uh of different end users to<br>make sure that the quality of the data<br>that we were getting from these low-cost<br>sensors could approximate the kind of<br>data that we could see from the higher<br>end really expensive regulatory monitors<br>and we discovered that if we knew our<br>sensor and we knew its accuracy and<br>precision we knew it's calibration<br>limits and we knew how to calibrate it<br>and we knew the detection limits and<br>response time of the instrument then<br>actually we could come up with a pretty<br>good approximation for what was<br>happening what we could measure with the<br>regulatory instruments<br>but with all sensors they have their<br>limits and some of them were really<br>difficult to produce a good calibration<br>curve associated with them<br>the other thing that we found if you<br>look back at the literature is there's a<br>whole bunch of people testing different<br>low-cost sensors but again there's no<br>consistency in the methodology so if you<br>look at one set of results then they<br>they've compared it at one environment<br>and another set of results will all<br>compare them in the lab and so it's<br>again very difficult to work out how you<br>compare the models tested by one group<br>with the models tested by another<br>and all of these low-cost sensors are<br>infected are affected by environmental<br>parameters so it's really important to<br>know how it's going to be affected by<br>temperature of the presence of other<br>pollutants and even things like can we<br>find the presence of a spider web or<br>dust on our sensor can we identify these<br>kind of limitations<br>so we did a lot of work together with<br>aeroqual and mote and thinking about<br>these low-cost sensors and trying to<br>make them work for us as a in a way that<br>was as closely as proximated as these<br>regulatory style instruments but<br>genuinely cheaper<br>and the trouble with low-cost sensors is<br>you might be able to buy the sensor<br>relatively cheaply but then you get a<br>whole bunch of extra costs when you go<br>try and then calibrate it and deploy<br>them<br>so there's a huge there was a huge<br>amount of research that went on over<br>those years<br>and how do they compare to compliance<br>instruments well I just complained that<br>all the different models and the<br>different studies don't relate to each<br>other so I've just I've just chosen one<br>and I chose this one because they<br>actually compare<br>studies from cheap sensors so these are<br>easy and then we've got studies too from<br>our more expensive sensors and when we<br>look at it we can see that if we run<br>these in the lab pretty much they all<br>work the same so there's a pretty good<br>um so essentially the further to the<br>right they go the better they work and<br>the smaller the bar the better they work<br>and the ones that in the laboratory they<br>all pretty much work the same but when<br>we put them out in the field you can see<br>that both the low-cost sensors and the<br>high cost regulatory sensors have<br>problems and so choosing the right<br>instrument for the right location is<br>really important and one of the the<br>conclusions that we drew and others is<br>that field calibration so going out into<br>the field and calibrating our senses in<br>so our first go at running a network of<br>these low-cost sensors took place in<br>Vancouver and we did calibrate these in<br>the field and you can see them lined up<br>here alongside a regulatory monitoring<br>station in Vancouver Vancouver was<br>chosen because it already had a really<br>dense network of regulatory monitors in<br>the low Fraser Valley and this here is<br>the lower Fraser Valley regulatory<br>monitoring Network and the bar extends<br>over the time period of our study which<br>is about three months and you can see<br>that the regulator or sorry she's did a<br>really nice job at getting a very good<br>data set a continuous data set at all<br>their sites bar one through the entire<br>period<br>now we were operating roughly two and a<br>half times the number of sites using<br>these low-cost instruments and you can<br>see our data failures<br>so we were really struggling still<br>um and this is 2014 so it was early days<br>of these sensors to keep them running to<br>keep them calibrated we ran them in<br>duplicates but it still meant that we<br>had to go I didn't have to go the poor<br>field assistance had to go running<br>around the countryside sorting out these<br>sensors we had problems with instrument<br>housing with data storage with<br>transmission with power failures the<br>cost of running this network was still<br>so between 2016 and 2022 we started<br>finding solutions for this and this time<br>the solutions were driven mainly by the<br>maths and the statistics and the<br>correlations rather than by the actual<br>field measurements themselves and we had<br>a very a talented postdoc leaner Wizard<br>and a very talented PhD student who did<br>most of this work and what they<br>discovered was that actually the<br>measurements weren't asensitive to<br>specific location that we thought but<br>they correlated well with land use so<br>Place becomes really important we<br>discovered that co-location on site was<br>really helpful again place is important<br>and we discovered that statistical<br>models could be used to mineralize<br>minimize operational errors we could use<br>it for calibration we could use them to<br>detect when the instrument failed<br>um<br>but these these statistical models work<br>best when we connected them to land use<br>variables<br>and so over the course of those years we<br>spent time in Vancouver in Auckland and<br>in Southern California working with<br>these models and working with these<br>instruments as well to see how we could<br>make the low-cost sensors low costs in a<br>and the fundamental outcome I think<br>perhaps David and others would would<br>agree is that locations seem to be<br>really important if we could fuse our<br>models with our sensor sensor data and<br>fuse the models for the sensor<br>management with our data collection then<br>we could come up with a way that we<br>could make sense of the data and keep<br>the the instruments true to the worlds<br>in which they were measuring and land<br>use regression or land use models<br>actually turned out to be one of the<br>most successful ways that we could<br>control how these instruments were<br>performing in essentially a complex or a<br>naughty environment<br>interestingly we could feed these<br>results back into the modeling and our<br>land use bottles ended up showing us<br>other important things about the world<br>of air pollution for example land use<br>similarity was more important than site<br>proximity when we came to run our models<br>so if we came to run a model<br>um a statistical model for air pollution<br>if we use data from a meteorological<br>site that had very similar land use to<br>where we were modeling then it worked a<br>whole lot better than if we chose the<br>site which was nearest but perhaps quite<br>different in terms of land use<br>and so this is the work that one of<br>Kim's PhD students Anushka was doing<br>so we were starting to see the<br>importance of place being fed back to us<br>in terms of the modeling work that we<br>were doing using the data that we<br>collected using these high density<br>instruments<br>what's the words that I was occupied<br>with and and many of my colleagues<br>and I don't think many of us have really<br>ventured into this world of commercially<br>driven NGO crowdfunded largely well 30<br>of those projects have been crowdfunded<br>sensor collection using these cheap<br>sensors but you can see they're a highly<br>popular large numbers of people have<br>these instruments<br>um not many if any have been used with<br>any calibration not many have been used<br>with people who have experience of data<br>collection and you've got thousands of<br>monitors out there<br>but what we're seeing now towards the<br>end of that period is that some of the<br>research work that we and others have<br>been doing to improve the performance of<br>the the what the low-cost sensors in our<br>own research networks can be applied to<br>some of these low-cost sensor large data<br>Collections and purple air is one such<br>company that has been working hard on<br>this in this space<br>now as William as David said in 2019<br>actually this creates a problem because<br>we've got essentially two sorts of data<br>we've got the data from the regulatory<br>authorities and we've got the data from<br>low-cost instruments it appears the same<br>as a number but actually it's hiding two<br>quite different methods of data<br>collection and that results in issues of<br>trust and it it also starts to challenge<br>our notion of what's real what's really<br>mirroring the world out there as opposed<br>to what is um maybe perhaps just working<br>a bit like a random number generator<br>and so we're starting to to deal with<br>issues of trust and communication of<br>science which we didn't have before when<br>we were all thinking about the world in<br>now this has implications when we're<br>thinking about using the data that we've<br>collected for decision making and so far<br>a lot of the research that I've done<br>hadn't had a huge impact on the in the<br>regulatory space we had the odd success<br>so the work that Shannon did using buses<br>and fed directly into some of the<br>council's regulations around idling<br>buses we've had other successes where<br>we've shown some of the the distance<br>from bus stops and the way in traffic<br>flows around the city affects air<br>pollution and that too is fed back into<br>some of the management strategies<br>but if we look at a lot of the decision<br>making uh in and the successful<br>regulation of air quality historically<br>many of those uh success stories weren't<br>founded on lots of data we look at the<br>Clean Air acts in the 1950s they often<br>had very little data<br>um maybe just one site and maybe it was<br>just thinking about changes in color on<br>a filter paper or one measurement of<br>sulfur dioxide and yet they were able to<br>succeed in radical changes in air<br>quality over a shortish period of time<br>if we look at some of the work here in<br>Auckland we've seen significant<br>improvements in carbon monoxide and Lead<br>concentrations and again I don't think<br>that can be directly related to the<br>amount of data that was available<br>we can look to more recent examples of<br>the use of technology to see whether the<br>data itself might have an impact on<br>decision making<br>and some of the work that Hamish has<br>been doing here<br>in Auckland has been making use of the<br>of the covid-19 traffic flow reduction<br>associated with lockdowns<br>who former colleague of mine at<br>Birmingham<br>um did some work<br>um look really looked at how effective<br>traffic flow reductions were an air<br>pollution and essentially all you need<br>to do take away from this is if you've<br>got a blue color then you've got a a<br>large amount of air pollution reduction<br>if you've got a green color you've got<br>less you sort of go towards the pinks<br>and the purples and actually you're<br>seeing an increase in air pollution and<br>you can see just by looking at this is<br>data just from regulatory monitoring<br>stations from 63 cities and 25 countries<br>as a lot of data you can see that it's a<br>very mixed response it's a very complex<br>and naughty world out there when it<br>comes to relating traffic flow<br>reductions with changing levels of air<br>pollution<br>so that was the regulatory Network did<br>we see an added value from our low-cost<br>networks well yes in terms of the purple<br>air sensors they were able to be used<br>indoors as well as outdoors and so we<br>were able to see differences in exposure<br>experienced by people who were<br>essentially in lockdown at home compared<br>to their exposure in offices<br>so we were starting to be able to model<br>exposure much more effectively by having<br>these increased uh sensors which were<br>still corrected by mathematical<br>algorithms<br>and if we look at hamish's work we can<br>see that our higher resolution data was<br>really effective in helping us to<br>understand some of the spatial patterns<br>in our own City in terms of how much air<br>pollution was reduced associated with<br>lockdown and which areas were affected<br>more than others<br>for example on the face of it we look at<br>two different lockdowns the lockdown<br>level three where we saw a similar<br>traffic reduction in 2020 to 2021 that's<br>a typo and you can see that 21 was<br>reduced in 2020 and 20 in 2021 we saw a<br>64 reduction in Ultra fines essentially<br>the same reduction in traffic and yet a<br>completely different result<br>so what Hamish was able to do is point<br>towards things like changes in traffic<br>flow changes in meteorology changes in<br>the trucks and bus routines between the<br>two periods and show that using these<br>handheld instruments at high resolution<br>the importance of local knowledge<br>situated knowledge and the role of<br>people in terms of understanding our<br>so in summer we've undoubtedly changed<br>the way in which we collected air<br>quality data and the types of data we<br>produce we've gone from being relatively<br>data poor to data Rich from just good<br>quality data to a massive data still<br>numbers but of unknown quality we've<br>gone from specialist collecting the data<br>to a whole bunch of different end users<br>including citizen scientists<br>we've gone from small scale projects to<br>large-scale projects carefully plan to<br>opportunistic research projects and<br>government or research funded groups to<br>Commercial and citizen funded projects<br>now these are quite significant changes<br>in the way we do science as well as the<br>types of data that are available and the<br>people that information that data is<br>available to<br>so we might expect to have had that<br>radical change in in our ability then to<br>think about how we mitigate air<br>pollution science<br>for example we've seen we've come a<br>really long way in our ability to<br>describe the atmosphere in three<br>dimensions but also just at the surface<br>and I nearly didn't put in this figure<br>because this was my first attempt as an<br>MSC student in 1996 to draw a map from a<br>model now this particular map was<br>validated a single point it<br>um The Contours themselves that we've no<br>idea whether the model produced anything<br>that was even vaguely realistic and the<br>map you can say it's actually really<br>hard to interpret this was the best we<br>could do in 1996 and I nearly didn't put<br>it in it was anywhere in my examiners<br>form fell out of the inside of the<br>thesis and I read excellent thesis at<br>all maybe I should put it in because<br>this is what it was this was state of<br>the art in 1996 and if we compare this<br>to what zhi Ying did as he just finished<br>up his PhD and he was able to show<br>models in so much more detail at<br>multiple scales that had been validated<br>at multiple points within both the city<br>CBD and the area around it<br>it's so much easier to understand that<br>information than the information that I<br>was providing in 1996.<br>and even within the last uh 10 or 15<br>years we've seen advantages and things<br>uh like this was a piece of work that we<br>did<br>um that Nick Talbot and I did with Kim<br>in 2010 or 11 and we were looking at<br>these images of the Auckland Smog and<br>trying to work out where it was and when<br>it occurred and we did a very nice piece<br>of climatological analysis which<br>actually got used by the Met Service as<br>a way to forecast and when we get these<br>Haze events and Kim was able to show<br>there's a relationship between Hayes<br>events and Hospital analysis so we could<br>give you this sort of General well you<br>know when it's really cold and you've<br>got this kind of high pressure<br>conditions then we're likely to see the<br>haze type uh study um which worked very<br>nicely but even just 10 years after that<br>Hannah was able to use a celiometer to<br>get these really detailed fine images of<br>what was actually happening in the<br>atmosphere she could produce a much more<br>complex understanding of the role of sea<br>breezes the the layering of the<br>atmosphere and movement of pollutants in<br>and out of the city that explained the<br>haze in much better detail than the work<br>that we did with a failed Max doas at<br>the time 10 years prior<br>so the research toys have got easier to<br>you maybe easier to use you have to be<br>much better at math and than I did but<br>you've got and the research Choice are a<br>bit cheaper this one was on loan from<br>University of British Columbia<br>um so you know there have been changes<br>there we've got we've made progress but<br>Hannah's work has yet to work its way<br>back into the policy space and see<br>whether we can then forecast our Brown<br>Haze better the work the early work that<br>we did provided a a an easy statistical<br>route from for measuring and modeling<br>when we were expecting to see brown<br>Hayes<br>in some areas we haven't seen so much<br>change the the the technologies that I<br>was using in in Toulouse and Basel and<br>Marseille really haven't changed much<br>but what has changed is we've got a<br>whole lot more data measured in the same<br>way from a variety of different cities<br>and so now we can ask different<br>questions<br>for example Lena spent some time looking<br>at auckland's Carbon fluxes and was able<br>to show where it sat among a bunch of<br>other cities who are all measuring<br>carbon fluxes in the same way and that<br>gave us an idea of the role of<br>vegetation as an offset and how much of<br>our carbon fluxes we needed to to take<br>responsibility for when we're thinking<br>about carbon offsetting<br>so some things have changed but other<br>things haven't really changed the<br>methods that we as researchers are using<br>haven't really changed we still are<br>steeped in the standard research process<br>that involves scientific methods<br>scientific data collection the notion of<br>objective neutral fat collection<br>and we've just upscaled if you like the<br>amount of data that we've collected<br>which in itself I think is inadvertently<br>reinforced this idea of neutral<br>objective data that's this value free<br>data that's just been sitting there<br>the reason why more data hasn't resulted<br>in Step changes in theory could be<br>perhaps because this is a naughty world<br>and it's just really complicated but it<br>could also be that we're not actually<br>still asking the right questions<br>and whilst the quality of some of the<br>data of those low-cost instruments in<br>those big citizen science networks may<br>be somewhat questionable I think it<br>might be time now for us as research<br>scientists to engage with those<br>Community groups a bit better to ask the<br>questions that are relevant to them and<br>to think about how we can help to bring<br>and to upscale some of the research that<br>they've been doing and make it perhaps<br>similar or perhaps to ask different<br>questions to the work that we're doing<br>and this is the way that the error call<br>has been really successful in doing<br>thinking about how to enable Community<br>groups to collect low-cost data that is<br>actually more than a random number<br>but there's still also a large gap<br>between those of us doing research and<br>the policy and decision makers<br>so when it comes to answering the<br>question have we changed our Paradigm in<br>terms of air quality monitoring in the<br>way perhaps that Snyder envisage I think<br>the answer is no yes we've got expanded<br>use by communities and individuals but<br>I'm not sure we're yet there for new and<br>enhanced applications yes we've got<br>increased data availability and access<br>but again I don't think we've seen a<br>shift of radical shift as we would be<br>required for a paradigm shift in the way<br>in which we conduct our science<br>back in January we were sort of<br>semi-locked down and it was January so<br>what else have you got to do I counted<br>the number of papers that that used uh<br>Network and low-cost instrument in the<br>title and there were 700 of them<br>97 of those were from 2016 onwards<br>the earliest paper 2001. so you can see<br>the shift really has happened basically<br>in the last not even 10 years so we're<br>talking maybe six years there have been<br>17 Major Field campaigns in that time<br>but actually only 11 of those studies<br>mentioned applied research and if we<br>think about policy impact and evaluation<br>we're down to one percent<br>so the these sensors May yet still be in<br>their very nascent period in terms of<br>the impacts that we might expect to see<br>perhaps even in 10 years from now<br>but I think it's it's important for us<br>as scientists to think about what the<br>data<br>policy decision makers actually need<br>so there's a difference I think too<br>between what they think they need and<br>what we think they need and that might<br>also be part of the tension<br>suppose you makers need to describe the<br>atmosphere that's part of their legal<br>requirement they need to be able to<br>describe changes in time and space to<br>evaluate and justify their abatement<br>strategies<br>many of them also are required now to<br>produce forecasts or Hazard Warning<br>Systems<br>some will come to us and ask what should<br>we be measuring can we get co-benefits<br>from our data<br>but certainly the ones I've spoken to<br>are all after objective independent data<br>facts metrics numbers certainty what<br>they really want is certainty behind<br>their decision making they want to know<br>that if there's another person looks at<br>the same data they would make the same<br>decision as they had<br>and we've swung I think perhaps towards<br>justifying action or inaction based on<br>facts assuming that facts somehow not<br>subjective<br>but I would argue the facts do not speak<br>for themselves they always have a layer<br>of interpretation and what we've seen<br>behind them is that little p politics of<br>all those subjective little decisions<br>that go into creating that data set<br>so perhaps I could be bold and say what<br>do decision makers actually need moving<br>forward<br>well maybe we need to think move away<br>from thresholds and think about other<br>ways to to change Behavior<br>thresholds have limitations especially<br>when we actually don't know what the<br>safe threshold is for many pollutants<br>and for some pollutions we don't even<br>really know how to measure them so<br>having a threshold may not be the most<br>efficient approach<br>we certainly need to challenge the<br>notion that having more data reduces<br>uncertainty<br>and talking to some decision makers you<br>get the sense that the more<br>controversial the decision the more data<br>they need in order to be able to justify<br>the decision<br>I think we also need to think about new<br>decision makers so in the beginning I<br>said well we we have this citizens who<br>make decisions about their behavior we<br>have the research scientists who make<br>decisions about how to analyze the data<br>and how to understand the processes and<br>we have The Regulators making decisions<br>well I wonder whether if we emphasize<br>the role of citizens in making decisions<br>about how to change their own behavior<br>how to mitigate their own exposure how<br>to reduce the amounts of pollution that<br>they're putting into the atmosphere<br>whether that might be a more effective<br>way of managing air quality<br>and we can look at some of these<br>commercial providers like air quality AG<br>who've really gone into that space to<br>think about this this production of data<br>I think the last thing I want to say is<br>that how we frame our measurements as<br>scientists matters so when we're<br>communicating our science if we frame it<br>as an engineering problem<br>then we tend to promote management via<br>thresholds and limits it tends to move<br>us to more towards legal definitions and<br>requirements and the size of the error<br>that we're allowed if we Define it as a<br>research problem we can come up with a<br>different set of ways that we might<br>answer some of our questions<br>and if we Define it as a social problem<br>and include understanding Behavior<br>change then we start to enter the sort<br>of more uncomfortable space for<br>scientists like me but actually that<br>space I think is now ripe<br>together with the technology for for the<br>changes that we were looking for in<br>so would an improved numerical mirror of<br>our naughty worlds around us alone give<br>us the improvements that we were hoping<br>for in terms of Environmental Management<br>no I don't think so I think it's<br>unlikely just that numerical mirror<br>alone I don't think we're going to see<br>better Environmental Management we might<br>see some better understanding of the way<br>in which our ecosocial processes shape<br>the atmosphere but I don't think we're<br>going to see a significant Improvement<br>but if we can put the people back into<br>science if we can acknowledge all those<br>subjective choices the Little P politics<br>if we can acknowledge the art form that<br>goes within data collection model<br>selection interpretation all of those<br>value-based judgments that go into<br>knowledge generation<br>then we've given added value to our<br>numbers<br>and if we reevaluate the importance that<br>we allocate numerical data and we<br>communicate the errors and limitations<br>of our studies then we leave space for<br>other types of knowledge and those other<br>types of knowledge might be better at<br>helping us to change our behaviors<br>so with that I'd like to finish by<br>thanking all the people who've helped me<br>to get to where I am today and I realize<br>that that's actually probably a huge<br>challenge because I'm going to miss<br>people out<br>so I'd really like to say thank you to<br>my academic mentors and supervisors who<br>believed in me when I didn't believe in<br>me who were able to help me persevere<br>and persist with my uh science at times<br>when it really felt like I wasn't<br>getting anywhere<br>so I'd like to mention Elizabeth Turner<br>Glenn McGregor Doug Middleton in<br>McKendree and David Williams you've made<br>a huge impact on my life<br>um thank you I'd also like to thank my<br>colleagues especially Kim Dirks you made<br>data collection fun and without you it<br>wouldn't have been possible to keep<br>going because it made it fun to come to<br>work it made it fun to go out in the<br>field and yes we collected data on sunny<br>days but sometimes those mornings were<br>very cold so thank you Kim<br>I wouldn't be here without you I think<br>and then finally to say thank you to my<br>students um you guys have taught me more<br>than I've taught you and I really have<br>so enjoyed watching you gain in<br>confidence and in in knowledge<br>you each have taught me different things<br>and just at the end here I'd like to<br>acknowledge Woody who taught me the<br>importance of taking risks in research<br>who also taught me that actually<br>nothing's impossible you can make it<br>work if you really try<br>but who I could not teach the importance<br>of a calculated risk<br>so thank you to everybody<br>um without you I wouldn't be here<br>thank you Jenny when I started off my<br>PhD I was working in atmospheric science<br>as it happens before I became a computer<br>scientist<br>I think if Jenny was there telling me<br>the advice that she told herself to be a<br>fair weather data collector<br>and work during the day I might still be<br>a<br>atmospheric scientist instead I became<br>a physicist with the mathematics is who<br>is studying rainfall at night so maybe<br>that explains why I shifted Fields Jenny<br>thank you for for what you did I don't<br>know if we're running a little bit late<br>but I I'm sure you happy to take a few<br>questions<br>they're doing great talk to you he<br>really loved it<br>um I love the whole whole<br>Mystic breed for it the question I've<br>got for you is around and thinking about<br>the New Zealand situation and the<br>breadth of environmental challenges that<br>are before us and the challenge of Base<br>selling data<br>what can we do around Baseline data in<br>this country you post some really<br>interesting questions that have made you<br>stick to that as we're trying to<br>move forward in terms of perhaps<br>monitoring change Through Time<br>the old would be your advice for example<br>to the ministry for the environment<br>um<br>it's a challenge when I was doing the<br>reading for this and one of the things<br>I've really enjoyed about being a<br>sabbatical is a time to read I read that<br>geographers who who couldn't<br>um were unable to identify an underlying<br>process satisfied themselves with<br>studying change and those who couldn't<br>study the change could at least satisfy<br>themselves with stating the rate of<br>change and those who couldn't study the<br>rate of change resorted to statistics<br>um<br>harsh but there's possibly some truth in<br>that and and I wonder whether this<br>search for Baseline is back to the<br>search between what's natural and what's<br>cultural so what what was there before<br>we were there and what we created and I<br>think that might be an artificial<br>distinction and and I think that<br>actually what we need to do now is think<br>about what matters so if we're thinking<br>about a baseline as a natural a<br>naturally occurring substance that's<br>higher than what we think is safe then<br>we probably need to be controlling our<br>activities around that at the moment we<br>don't<br>um so that would be my advice to the uh<br>The Regulators in New Zealand is that<br>just because it's natural doesn't mean<br>it's safe<br>and and the other thing I would suggest<br>is this idea of remediation<br>um I<br>it requires us to understand what the<br>world looks like<br>before we were there and I'm not sure<br>that this is actually a helpful way of<br>thinking about the world itself maybe we<br>just need to be thinking about<br>how we work in harmony with the worlds<br>around us rather than trying to fight<br>them with how we work in harmony with<br>ourselves and share our resources<br>equitably and sustainably and so if we<br>reframe the questions not being about<br>thresholds or baselines but are being<br>about how we live responsibly and<br>ethically then we ask different<br>questions and we come up with different<br>answers so that might be where I go with<br>yeah great presentation I guess my<br>questions around kind of the focus on<br>policy almost versus<br>the use of local sentences I think I<br>understand that policy will have a<br>bigger effect but what is an important<br>Behavior change has to play in terms of<br>things<br>um having a local cities as well I do<br>not public to understand the evolution<br>of what they were exposed to change<br>behaviors to reduce<br>so I'm not convinced that policy will<br>have a bigger impact than Behavior<br>change I think the trouble with policy<br>is that it is political so you can end<br>up setting a threshold oh we're not<br>going to make the threshold we had all<br>these penalties that we were going to<br>put in place we'll give you an extra<br>year oh we'll give you an extra two<br>years or maybe we'll change the<br>threshold so I'm not sure the policy is<br>the solution<br>um I think the thing about low-cost<br>census is it's a direct reminder of what<br>you're doing and the consequence it has<br>so if you're driving to work and you're<br>seeing the pollution from the cars or<br>you're driving or sitting on a bus or<br>you're walking to work or you're looking<br>and you're sitting in front of your log<br>fire and you're seeing the smoke filling<br>your land your smells lovely but<br>actually you're seeing quite a lot of<br>particulates<br>um then I think you're more likely to<br>see action and reaction or cause and<br>effect and change your behavior<br>accordingly and I think some of your<br>your own work has shown that actually<br>using these low-cost sensors to educate<br>kids and their parents is a really<br>effective way way of moving forward in<br>terms of helping people to understand<br>why they need to change their behavior<br>um and and it's identified areas for us<br>in terms of research in the indoor<br>environment perhaps where we need to go<br>in the future that might help us to to<br>reduce individual exposure<br>so I think that's where I'd go with that<br>one<br>no other questions<br>okay in that case uh let's thank Jenny<br>I think you can see why she got promoted</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
