This presentation is part of the international events for the Italian Design Day 2023 and is organised by The Future Cities Research Hub in collaboration with the Embassy of Italy in Wellington and Studio Carolina Izzo, Auckland.<br><br>About the speaker:<br>Luca Bertacchi is an Italian architect, urban planner, photographer and globetrotter. Passionate about travel and the cultures in which his projects are located, his working approach allows for creating projects with identity, seeking solid and complete solutions based on complex parameters and a strong environmental approach. With particular attention to the aspects of use, design and organisation of space, Luca excels in maintaining a strong concept throughout the different phases of the project until the end of the construction. Luca joined Bechu + Associés in Paris in January 2015, becoming Associate Partner and Director of Architecture, working on a wide range of projects worldwide. Before moving to this appointment, Luca worked for ten years as Senior Architect at the internationally renowned firm Mario Cucinella Architects and co-founded the interior design firm Studio Battiferro in Italy. Luca has also been an official photographer of the Olympic and Paralympic Torch Relay at the 2006 Olympic Winter Games in Turin, Italy and, later, in 2009 and 2010, at the Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada.<br><br>Keep up to date with new #UoACreatives content and events here:<br>https://linktr.ee/uoacreatives</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>No transcript available</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
