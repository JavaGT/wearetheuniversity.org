Simon<br>Rosenbaum here with us today uh it's<br>it's our first one for tokori this is<br>something we're going to make a regular<br>feature so we hope to see all of you<br>again and more in the time ahead we<br>might even get to a point where we can<br>book a bigger lecture theater hopefully<br>but tokori is a is a center that's been<br>formed up at Victoria University as a<br>partnership between sport Museum and<br>and it's also a partnership between<br>tongue and Defender and tangiti uh in<br>that uh all our positions within the<br>center are duplicate roles uh<br>representing both sides of the treaty<br>our mission at hokkori is around driving<br>research and and Workforce Development<br>which fills the Gap that we see<br>currently in New Zealand but also<br>internationally in terms of physical<br>activity promotion<br>we're excited to finally welcome I'm<br>excited finally welcome Simon Rosenbaum<br>associate professor Simon Rosenbaum here<br>to Wellington thank you so much to Ruth<br>uh for getting him to New Zealand thank<br>you to Gregor for getting him to<br>Wellington and thank you also to Julie<br>and Nicola for their support for this<br>initiative and for this seminar series<br>from from here today from sport New<br>Zealand I've known Simon now for I think<br>we met each other in 2012 at a little<br>seminar<br>um and we hit it off then and in that<br>time he's definitely cemented himself as<br>the global expert uh the go-to person<br>when it comes to physical activity and<br>mental health I've watched on from afar<br>I've tried to keep up with him it's<br>Quite a feat I've watched on from afar<br>as he's just gone through done some<br>amazing stuff and I'm really excited<br>today he's just promised me on the walk<br>over here that he's presenting a whole<br>bunch of stuff that I've never seen<br>before so that's exciting for me<br>um and I'm looking forward to hearing<br>about some of the remarkable work that<br>he's done and what he's achieved is he<br>shares his thoughts with us today thanks<br>Simon<br>foreign<br>on I know it's a big deal when Justin's<br>wearing pants<br>um I'm not sure so yeah just just in<br>general<br>um okay look thanks so much for having<br>me<br>um I just I mean that welcome firstly<br>I'm from Australia I'm sure a lot of<br>people have been there it's not like I'm<br>far away<br>um it's really important that we<br>acknowledge of traditional custodians of<br>the land in which I come from that's the<br>the category digital people<br>and it's just being here I realize how<br>far Australia has to go and how sad it<br>actually is the the context at the<br>moment if you're following Australian<br>Politics the referendum that's taking<br>place it's gonna be an ugly War so I<br>think this is really important thank you<br>it's just really<br>um it's really<br>uh just motivating and to see what<br>what's happening here in New Zealand<br>um<br>talk about today<br>is a bunch of work that we're doing<br>focusing on workforces so I'll present a<br>little bit of evidence around why why is<br>physical activity so critical for mental<br>health apologies if there's any mental<br>health clinicians or Professionals in<br>the audience there's only one or two<br>slides of very basic mental health<br>related stuff and then we'll go into<br>sort of what's Happening going forward<br>um and I'll talk a bit about a Global<br>Perspective around how we're merging<br>these two workforces including in<br>humanitarian and conflict affected<br>settings and the sort of real<br>opportunities that there are for sport<br>physical activity and mental health<br>working together<br>so the first thing I think is really<br>important we sort of use this a lot is<br>just talking briefly about the<br>difference between mental health and<br>mental illness because they are<br>different things they exist on different<br>continuums and not to get them confused<br>so essentially on one axis we've got<br>mental health so the idea of optimal<br>mental health poor mental health at any<br>point in time we're somewhere on that<br>Spectrum I haven't slept on a bit jet<br>lag I do get quite anxious so you could<br>put me down here yeah I don't have a<br>mental illness but right now it's<br>stressed bit anxious yeah<br>likewise you could have someone with a<br>serious mental illness could be<br>schizophrenia bipolar disorder PTSD<br>whatever it is so they've got that<br>serious mental illness but they're in<br>treatment so it might be whatever that<br>treatment is for them talking based<br>therapy a combination talking based<br>therapy medication physical activity<br>what is it whatever it is that's<br>important for that person at that point<br>in time<br>now the important thing with this when<br>we think about physical activity is that<br>no matter where someone is no matter<br>which quadrant there is a role for<br>physical activity as part of treatment<br>okay so if we've got someone down here<br>that sort of serious quadrant with a<br>diagnosed mental illness experiencing<br>poor mental health they could be in a<br>hospital they might be in an intensive<br>care mental health Intensive Care Unit<br>there's still a role from physical<br>activity<br>but we just have to make sure that the<br>resources and the support that we<br>provide to people matches the need where<br>they are at that point in time and<br>that's where we're failing yeah likewise<br>all the way through to here where<br>someone optimal mental health no mental<br>illness General stress general anxiety<br>well-being Justin's done a lot of work<br>in that space physical activity has a<br>now I've got a whole lecture I do using<br>social media<br>social media slides or pictures and I<br>think this one just sums it up perfectly<br>for me someone just saying you know I'm<br>sick of people who don't have a mental<br>illness saying I should just exercise to<br>help my mood 97 of the time I don't have<br>the energy to shower or make food so how<br>the F am I going to exercise<br>just shut up and even yesterday I had an<br>interview with a journalist there was a<br>new review that's come out and they've<br>concluded that physical activity is 1.5<br>times more effective than medication I<br>don't know what that means but it's a<br>terrible message it's a dangerous<br>message that we send<br>and one of the reasons it's so dangerous<br>is the idea of Shame and guilt that it<br>lumps on to people who are already<br>experiencing these barriers these<br>challenges to get active<br>so I would say that this is not a<br>failure of that individual it's a<br>failure of the system and the support<br>that we're providing to support that<br>person to actually engage and to be<br>physically active<br>so with that idea in mind about matching<br>the resources to the level of need of<br>the person we're working with this is a<br>pyramid that we've been working on<br>together with Justin and a colleague<br>Anna farrello in the UK<br>and this is based on the humanitarian<br>mental health pyramid so I'll just<br>explain that briefly in Conflict<br>affected or humanitarian areas Mental<br>Health Care is divided into four layers<br>at the top of the pyramid is what we<br>call Specialized Care so that would be a<br>psychiatrist and down the bottom is<br>basic needs and so we're using that<br>pyramid but we've replicated that<br>thinking about physical activity yeah<br>but this applies not just in a refugee<br>context but also in places like New<br>Zealand and Australia<br>at the very bottom we're talking about<br>ensuring appropriate access to equipment<br>and infrastructure that's the bare<br>minimum yeah that's not going to work<br>for everyone but it's the bare minimum<br>that we need to be doing and there's<br>plenty of guidelines who<br>guidelines that recommend people living<br>with a mental illness at very least need<br>to be provided with supported access<br>yeah so this is level one<br>now level two we considered being<br>Community sport Community physical<br>activity programs<br>so that might be park run it might be a<br>local gym it might be working with a<br>national Olympic Committee through those<br>those sporting committees just general<br>programs that are for the general<br>population not targeted<br>okay what we need to keep in mind here<br>is that these you know there's this word<br>this idea of psychological safety<br>and that these programs are likely not<br>psychologically safe for many of the<br>people we're trying to interact with or<br>trying to support yeah so simply giving<br>a gym membership is not going to work<br>for a lot of people there's a lot of<br>barriers there<br>that's when we move up the idea of focus<br>non-specialized programs<br>and this is where we might have for<br>example coaches or physical activity<br>Advocates or or physios trained in<br>mental health first aid<br>or other programs like that you know<br>there's a good example of team up which<br>is an initiative out of Europe training<br>Sports coaches in in basic what they<br>call psychosocial programming so they<br>can create those environments to engage<br>people experiencing distress<br>or experiencing poor Mental Health<br>then at that top of the pyramid we'd see<br>specialized support so again that could<br>be physiotherapy exercise physiology<br>whatever it is but that could be someone<br>living with you know severe persistent<br>mental illness we can still help that<br>person yeah we just need the right<br>resources not everyone will need this<br>but we need to know it's there and we<br>need to acknowledge that people will<br>move through this pyramid in different<br>ways and we need to have methods that we<br>can catch them and filter them back in<br>yep now I've got a bunch of QR codes on<br>these slides but don't worry because I<br>can make them available for Justin as<br>well and if there are any questions as<br>all right what what do you see with this<br>picture<br>what's the first thing that kind of<br>so it's a separation for starters yeah<br>so we've got mind on buddy and I think<br>this is a really good analogy for the<br>health system in general we've got the<br>psychiatrist psychologist everyone down<br>here working on the mind<br>then we have this body cardiologist GP<br>endocrinologist<br>now the reason this is so important is<br>that people living with a mental illness<br>will die up to 25 years earlier than the<br>general population<br>now that gapping life expectancy is not<br>due to Suicide it's overwhelmingly due<br>to premature preventable cardiovascular<br>disease<br>okay so there is this enormous Gap in<br>life expectancy which has been<br>identified as a scandal and a human<br>rights issue and this idea that if that<br>was affecting another population that<br>didn't carry the same stigma as people<br>living with mental illness at the<br>outrage and we'd actually do something<br>about it<br>yeah<br>the other thing that you'll notice here<br>is that premature cardiovascular disease<br>and that obesity and I'll go through<br>that in terms of the evidence is very<br>very clear that if someone is living<br>with a mental illness<br>regardless of what that diagnosis is<br>they are likely to experience a<br>significantly higher risk of<br>experiencing cardiovascular disease<br>so the question that this asks is well<br>what is routine mental health care<br>and the important thing that I'll stress<br>today is I'm not saying that existing<br>mental health treatments don't work or<br>are not needed that's absolutely not the<br>message the message is is that given the<br>evidence we have and what we know the<br>role of physical activity is it should<br>be an embedded integrated component of<br>care that's what all the evidence tells<br>us<br>and so raise this question this is a<br>picture I took in in Bangladesh in in<br>the biggest refugee camp in the world<br>the rohingya refugee camps this is a<br>game called chinlon it's quite common in<br>Southeast Asia it's a crazy game it's<br>like volleyball with your feet it's one<br>of the most athletic things I've seen<br>um a question being that given the what<br>we know about things like this is this<br>routine part of care of mental health<br>care<br>um now I spent six months working with a<br>UN agency in Bangladesh as the mental<br>health officer so we had 24 staff who<br>were social workers psychologists and<br>when we audited what they were doing in<br>Camp about 30 percent of everything they<br>did was organized sport<br>but they've got no training no<br>understanding why they just know it<br>works and so they might have some balls<br>Chuck some balls and that's it get going<br>in that sport so this is already<br>happening it's already part of what<br>they're doing but it's not recognized by<br>funders in the same way and that's<br>slowly changing and it's not given the<br>the same level of resourcing that it<br>I'll just quickly run through again some<br>of the evidence around the poor physical<br>health and I'm sure everyone's familiar<br>with this another big four risk factors<br>CBD<br>um we can just cross out cardiovascular<br>disease and replace that with poor<br>Mental Health<br>and the evidence is very very strong<br>this was a review led by Joe Firth in<br>World Psychiatry a couple of years ago<br>looking at the relationship between<br>these risk factors<br>um and some of the common disorders so<br>ADHD anxiety depression bipolar and<br>psychotic disorders and this is is open<br>access the strongest relationship with<br>exercise and depression for exercise as<br>a risk factor but also smoking as well<br>which is unsurprising and increasingly<br>we're seeing interventions trying to<br>tackle these together you know things<br>like nutrition physical activity because<br>now this idea about the physical health<br>of people living with mental illness<br>it's such a<br>a critical International issue that<br>there was a landsat commission in 2019.<br>so for those unfamiliar with Lancet<br>commissions they're done on things that<br>are deemed of being on issues being<br>deemed as being International<br>significance so there's been commissions<br>on back pain climate change opioid<br>addiction you know really really<br>important stuff that affect people<br>globally and you can see that quote<br>protecting the physical health of people<br>with mental illness should be considered<br>an international priority for reducing<br>the personal social and economic burden<br>of mental health conditions<br>and I'll walk you through the commission<br>there's four key points<br>one any mental illness is associated<br>with cardiovascular disease up to twice<br>the risk okay so we used to these to be<br>this idea this was only things like<br>schizophrenia but it's actually not true<br>it's across the entire Spectrum<br>interestingly we know there's<br>disturbances in these risk factors from<br>illness onset<br>and in some instances there's some<br>exciting work happening from a<br>prevention point of view<br>um and there's a race on at the moment<br>among the Big Data companies Google for<br>example can your wearables detect that<br>you're going to have an episode of poor<br>mental health before you do<br>and that sounds a bit crazy but if you<br>think about what your phone knows<br>it's got your social interaction it's<br>got your sleep it's got your physical<br>activity levels it might have your<br>nutrition if you're feeding that it's<br>got all these things that we know are<br>Disturbed<br>um as soon as people are seeking care<br>and there's even some interesting stuff<br>coming out now looking at um<br>even at ultra high risk people that are<br>at high risk of mental illness there's<br>already disturbances in some of these<br>one of the strongest examples we have is<br>post-traumatic stress disorder and the<br>trajectory of the illness can follow<br>patterns of physical activity<br>so we see that withdrawal we see that<br>decline in activity and it raises a<br>question about a sort of safety net and<br>if we can detect changes in those things<br>and capture people early<br>and intervene before physical health<br>deteriorates what happens to the<br>trajectory of the illness now of course<br>it's not going to cure every episode or<br>every case that's not what we're saying<br>but it can make a significant difference<br>and for some people it may be enough<br>the other recommendation here and this<br>is section four which I know really well<br>because I've LED it so it's very very<br>clear the recommendations that Mental<br>Health Services should provide<br>sufficient access to supervised exercise<br>programs<br>and we're following up at the moment<br>where we're doing an update to the<br>commission being very clear about what<br>that actually means because that wasn't<br>articulated and that pyramid will be<br>used to say look if you just have a<br>cupboard in the hospital where you've<br>got someone you know with an elastic<br>band that's a great start but it's not<br>enough because it's not enough it's not<br>what's needed and it's not in line with<br>the evidence around what we need to do<br>to help people actually participate<br>and finally the idea that physical<br>health services need to be prevention<br>focused so physical health deteriorates<br>rapidly when people come in contact with<br>a mental health service and I'll give<br>you one example early psychosis which is<br>a really important issue young people<br>um experiencing early psychosis are<br>often prescribed medication<br>antipsychotic medication that is<br>important it absolutely is needed for a<br>mental health perspective but there is a<br>rapid dramatic effect of that medication<br>on physical health<br>to give you an idea on average young<br>people will put on somewhere between<br>seven and nine kilograms in 12 weeks<br>okay but if you just think about what<br>that actually means and if a young<br>person comes in contact with a mental<br>health service<br>they take these drugs that they<br>absolutely need but something they don't<br>recognize themselves in the mirror and<br>their physical health is rapidly<br>deteriorated<br>we've shown in in Sydney that if you<br>intervene at day one so at the point of<br>initiation as soon as that young person<br>comes in contact with the Health Service<br>you can prevent that weight gain from<br>happening and we published that data<br>which was then enough for the district<br>to reinvest about a million dollars of<br>recurrent funding and roll that out<br>across the entire District<br>so we can again this isn't a gap in our<br>knowledge we know what to do we just<br>have to Resource these things<br>appropriately<br>a quick summary of the the evidence just<br>focusing on depression here this was a<br>piece of the New York Times that was<br>covering a paper that Justin and I were<br>involved with it was a big review in<br>2016 led by Felipe shook in Brazil<br>um and this was the the article in New<br>York Times super problematic if you just<br>look at this maybe you'll see why this<br>is really common the messaging the way<br>the media talks about this<br>is not helpful so having a picture of a<br>beautiful model running into a new dawn<br>it just sends the message hey get out of<br>bed go for a run you're cured you're<br>fine yeah and that's obviously not the<br>case<br>so I've got to be really careful about<br>how we actually sell this this is<br>probably a safe audience so I can point<br>out top quote<br>um I've been in trouble before with that<br>in the US I had a room that just went<br>silent but again you can see that same<br>thing unable to get up in the first<br>place and there's always whenever<br>there's coverage of this people are just<br>saying piss off like this isn't helpful<br>um now this has been updated just two<br>weeks ago this came out this is another<br>meta-analysis in the British Journal of<br>sports medicine what's really<br>interesting since 2016 is that the<br>number of Trials has nearly doubled and<br>the effect sizes have remain constant so<br>in other words the the robustness of<br>this data is just getting better and<br>better yeah<br>likewise Felipe led a great review that<br>he published in the American Journal of<br>psychiatry in 2018 looking at physical<br>activity and prevention<br>and from a public health perspective<br>this is super interesting<br>what that show was that if we shifted<br>population levels of physical activity<br>by as little as 60 Minutes a week<br>now that's per week not in one chunk it<br>can be broken up so it's 60 Minutes a<br>week we would prevent somewhere between<br>12 and 17 percent of incident cases of<br>depression globally<br>yeah now that's an enormous if you think<br>about the burden of disease of<br>depression the impact there around<br>prevention and focusing on prevention<br>measures that include activity is<br>now this is probably not relevant for a<br>physical activity audience but I'll just<br>go through it quickly the four domains<br>of activity which everyone here will be<br>familiar with in case of mental health<br>professionals in the audience<br>what we've got is four different types<br>so we'll call this Leisure or<br>recreational physical activity<br>occupational physical activity<br>transport and I think this might be one<br>of Justin's photos<br>um household activity that's not me<br>either they're not all equally<br>associated with mental health outcomes<br>so when we're talking about promoting<br>mental health we've got to be really<br>aware of that<br>Leisure and transport are the ones that<br>we seem to see a bigger relationship<br>with now that's not a surprise and to me<br>that's related to privilege it's related<br>to having the social capital the<br>financial Capital living in a safe<br>environment having footpaths having<br>shoes not having caring responsibilities<br>so you've got free time to be able to<br>participate and engage in activity<br>so I don't think it's a surprise that<br>high levels of occupation or physical<br>activity don't have the same benefit<br>and so we just need to be aware of that<br>when we're talking about promoting<br>physical activity<br>and there's some also really fantastic<br>data locally here from New Zealand I<br>think Ollie's here somewhere who I<br>haven't actually met before but nice to<br>meet you so there's some great data here<br>in New Zealand looking at the idea about<br>these different types as well and the<br>impact of socioeconomic status and some<br>of those factors that we know are so<br>critical<br>now this is a really recent paper that<br>was led by Stuart Bella it only came out<br>a few weeks ago he's a academic in<br>Australia Wollongong University does a<br>lot of work up Skilling Sports<br>workforces around mental health and he<br>developed ahead of the game which is a<br>fantastic initiative<br>but this is a really important piece<br>that just goes a little bit deeper into<br>some of those questions when we're<br>talking about promoting activity<br>um the fact is what they're called the<br>contextual factors that are related to<br>mental health outcomes<br>so some of the things to consider is<br>what the type of exercise we're doing<br>when and why it's happening for those<br>domains where we've all heard of blue<br>gym green gym being outside being near<br>water if you're lucky enough to have<br>access<br>who you do it with so the social<br>interactions and then importantly how<br>it's delivered and we know this is so<br>critical<br>and how relates to really important work<br>that leads on to where I'm going to take<br>this that this was Justin's PhD work<br>which I'm sure hopefully people are<br>familiar with I think it's one of the<br>most important pieces of data we have in<br>terms of the mental health impacts of<br>sport programs particularly in low<br>resource contexts<br>um so this is Justin's work in Uganda<br>essentially evaluating a football<br>competition<br>retail given he's sitting there but<br>essentially what it showed was that<br>having untrained or poorly trained<br>coaches<br>actually led to mental health outcomes<br>being worse among the participants<br>and this is such critical information<br>because when we talk about sport<br>physical activity we can't just say hey<br>here's the ball go and do something<br>we've got to think about how do we<br>upskill those workforces and do it<br>together<br>now that's where I think there's there's<br>real opportunity and what I'll sort of<br>talk about where we're we're going with<br>so how can we actually first of all<br>there are any questions I'll take it any<br>yeah so it depends where they are oh<br>sorry so the question was if we people<br>living with serious mental illness<br>experience barriers and it might be hard<br>you know to get out of bed how do we<br>actually engage and motivate so it<br>depends on the context on where they are<br>so for example if you've got someone<br>hospitalized there are specialist mental<br>health physiotherapists working in<br>hospitals who are extremely well skilled<br>in actually providing those<br>interventions<br>um if you've got someone in the<br>community there's ways of engaging with<br>a community mental health Team so that<br>it's done together<br>so that there are ways that we can do<br>this yeah it's not it's it's actually<br>not very novel or exciting it's quite<br>simple It's Going Back to Basics but<br>ensuring that we can actually meet that<br>person where they're at and<br>understanding what their barriers are<br>and how we can overcome them yeah I can<br>send some some more specific stuff after<br>this<br>so in terms of these professionals what<br>do we need to do to bring them together<br>and what can happen and so there's two<br>ways that we're thinking about this one<br>is the mental health professionals yeah<br>so<br>physical activity is typically not part<br>of a psychiatric or psychology training<br>program yeah increasingly that's<br>changing and we're seeing you know great<br>examples in places like Scandinavia<br>where it is happening but things like<br>healthy eating physical activity basic<br>assessment and counseling<br>you know as a psychiatrist if they've<br>got 30 seconds to dedicate to this and<br>they can ask one question to assess is<br>that being done<br>so there's ways that we can do but that<br>needs additional training<br>the bilateral referral pathways are so<br>critical we need to make sure that the<br>mental health Workforce understands how<br>they can refer and get support from the<br>sport physical activity Workforce and<br>vice versa<br>on the other side of things<br>if we talk about sports coaches physical<br>activity professionals<br>they don't have training in mental<br>health yeah so if we want that to be<br>safe we need to find a way that they can<br>be upskilled as well<br>now there's two two courses there<br>one Mental Health First Aid<br>and the other PFA which is psychological<br>first aid now these are really practical<br>skills that provide really concrete<br>skills on how to navigate safely through<br>someone that might be experiencing<br>mental health issues or suicidality<br>the difference between those two is that<br>Mental Health First Aid is typically<br>focused on high income High resource<br>settings that's where it was developed<br>PFA is what's used in in humanitarian<br>low-income<br>settings but essentially it's the same<br>principles it's getting those lay people<br>and providing some basic skills around<br>mental health and well-being now this<br>work in the past sort of six months has<br>come a really long way so it's really<br>this is the first time I've actually<br>been able to speak about it which is<br>exciting so this has been led by the<br>Olympic Refuge Foundation together with<br>a colleague Dr Leslie Snyder who<br>developed PFA for who back in the late<br>90s<br>now in September we went to Paris and we<br>got a group of sports coaches working in<br>Paris and we ran what we called PFA<br>sport so that was essentially just<br>training them in psychological first aid<br>but it was adapted and tweaked for a<br>sporting context<br>yeah<br>then a few weeks ago we were in Moldova<br>doing the same thing but the following<br>day we had the mental health<br>professionals come in so that acronym<br>mental health psychosocial support<br>so that's just what's used for broad<br>mental health professionals in in<br>humanitarian contexts<br>so day one we did PFA so psychological<br>first aid for the sports coaches day two<br>we got the mental health professionals<br>in and at the end of the day we actually<br>put them together<br>and we said right who's doing what where<br>and how can you link up<br>and we found some really fantastic<br>initiatives for example the squash<br>foundation in Moldova was running<br>programs for Ukrainian refugees but they<br>had absolutely no knowledge of the<br>mental health Workforce how to refer how<br>to get help likewise we have the mental<br>health Workforce saying yeah we'd love<br>to have support with Sport and physical<br>activity but we don't know how to do<br>that and so actually putting them<br>together<br>the next step and this is what's even<br>more excited next week I'm heading to<br>Poland<br>what we've got in collaboration with who<br>is we have one sports coach a senior<br>sports coach and a senior psychologist<br>from every region in Poland so there's<br>16. they're coming together and we've<br>got a three-day training of trainers but<br>the idea being that we'll train the the<br>coaches and the mental health<br>professionals together build those<br>Pathways understand what's needed and<br>then they will go back into their<br>regions and we'll continue to provide<br>support<br>now some of the interesting stuff that's<br>come out as well that the physical<br>activity or sport Workforce doesn't have<br>the skills or the confidence but that's<br>where if you team them up with the<br>mental health Workforce they can get<br>ongoing support and development and<br>supervision<br>and likewise the mental health Workforce<br>can get ongoing support and supervision<br>from the physical activity Sports<br>so there's lots of opportunity there and<br>I think that this is not just relevant<br>in that context but actually can be<br>applied in Australia here in New Zealand<br>it's wonderful they were<br>hello Okay<br>um<br>it's a Polish example is it about<br>training up the mental health<br>professionals so they can deliver the<br>physical activity intervention or is it<br>more about so that they know where to<br>refer people onto yeah not them<br>delivering themselves good good question<br>I think what we have to start is<br>recognition that this is important yeah<br>so we have some mental health<br>professionals and this is the same in<br>Australia in hospitals in probably the<br>same here and we published data on this<br>looking at the relationship between<br>psychiatrists own Fitness their own<br>physical activity levels and their<br>willingness to refer patients so that<br>that culture aspect is so critical where<br>I think we need to start at the very<br>bottom which is for so that all staff<br>have some foundational knowledge and<br>recognition that this is important this<br>is part of their job<br>the way we're evaluating this is a<br>questionnaire we've developed one of the<br>items is uh<br>strongly or what is it I agree that<br>promoting physical activity is part of<br>my job and what's interesting is when I<br>do that with the mhpss staff we often at<br>the start they say no and then very<br>quickly they say okay yeah this is part<br>of our job so there are some that are<br>all over it and they do it there are<br>some that don't so we need to start a<br>foundation present the evidence show<br>this is why and then work through how do<br>we get from there<br>yeah so I think it's probably the answer<br>is both and we'll get to the point where<br>the ones that are really engaged will<br>want additional training<br>co-delivering interventions together you<br>know if you've got a psychologist social<br>worker whatever it is and the sports<br>physical activity person doing the<br>sessions together that's where we'll<br>ultimately get to<br>it's also a<br>traditional care<br>and what I mean by that that Ukrainian<br>is a great example there's really high<br>levels of stigma among that group<br>towards mental illness what we've heard<br>is that they're not accessing Services<br>they just won't come<br>um but they're turning up and playing<br>sport<br>apparently Moldova a lot of them are<br>sleeping inside their cars at the oval<br>that's just where they're camping<br>so why not instead of trying to get them<br>to Mental Health Services put them into<br>Health Services where they are and where<br>they're at<br>yeah so someone just to go along with<br>that<br>um the the uh is there any use in trying<br>to explain what physical activity is to<br>mental health professionals or do you<br>not bother with it no of course that's<br>part of the training we do like what I<br>did here a lot of it was some of this<br>stuff but really basic you know what<br>what is Sport what is physical activity<br>it's not just going for a run outside<br>yeah so that's a that's a big part of it<br>so we talk about getting mental health<br>literacy among these guys we need<br>um what's the role of life and describe<br>what physical activity is fun sorry the<br>role of fun and enjoyment is a way to<br>engage and you might have my next slide<br>um but but in case like in case I took<br>it out the absolutely like when I when<br>I'm talking to mental health<br>professionals and when we cover the<br>evidence the critical thing is enjoyment<br>it's the only thing that matters for<br>long-term adherence<br>um so we've absolutely got to make it<br>fun and think about<br>that is the critical part there's some<br>really interesting work in in Norway<br>they've got they've done some great<br>stuff around four minutes are there any<br>Norwegians in here just before I<br>um so there's they've got this thing<br>around four minute intervals that they<br>do and they're obsessed with it because<br>of course it improves Fitness better<br>than steady state exercise of course but<br>who cares if no one's gonna do it but<br>they have this really strong thing that<br>know the patience is that the psych<br>Hospital have to do that before they do<br>what they want<br>um which I just can't understand because<br>all the data we have and the importance<br>around autonomy self-determination<br>building that people exercising because<br>they feel it for themselves and they<br>want to that's the way we're going to<br>change Behavior long term so the<br>enjoyment piece is the probably when I'm<br>doing this part that the most important<br>um any mental health professionals in<br>the room this was a review that we<br>published uh recently led by Dr Grace<br>McEwen who's was one of my PhD students<br>really simple floater for psychiatrists<br>saying right if you've got one minute<br>here's a tool you can use physical<br>activity Vital sign if that's all you<br>want to use screen on that above or<br>below 150 minutes refer take steps if<br>someone is flagging that they're at risk<br>do something about it the same way you<br>would around blood pressure all the<br>other things that are being measured<br>um and then if you've got a bit longer<br>you know some psychiatrists are<br>interested in this they'll prioritize it<br>a bit more there's other tools that can<br>be used that take a bit of time<br>a couple of just key points before I'll<br>open up a discussion um this is again<br>from Grace's thesis<br>this is around the importance of peer<br>workers and lived experience and for me<br>this is probably the most exciting thing<br>evolving in this work going forward<br>um So Graceful PhD was with emergency<br>service workers with post-traumatic<br>stress disorder and we recruited a bunch<br>and their family member or partner so<br>they got to nominate one person<br>and we put them together in a private<br>Facebook group and we had peer workers<br>who had lived experience of both being<br>an emergency service worker<br>and of experiencing PTSD<br>and they were the like our health<br>coaches<br>and this was an infographic on a paper<br>that Grace published that we can't see<br>um looking at the difference between<br>that expertise by training which is us<br>and that expertise by lived experience<br>and ensuring that we absolutely<br>prioritize and value that lived<br>experience equally with the the<br>technical expertise<br>um this was super interesting on the<br>Facebook group people would post I'm<br>having a bad day and before we had a<br>chance on the peer workers the the<br>participants would jump in and they'd be<br>on the phone having chats with each<br>other now we've got to make sure that's<br>safe we need to look at the skills of<br>that peer Workforce and there's a lot of<br>work happening there but I think when it<br>comes to physical activity promotion<br>that lived experience is so critical<br>because they can say and do things that<br>we can't and in a language that we don't<br>have<br>so I think it's it's really really<br>important<br>enjoyment this comes to the enjoyment<br>Factor so these were two animations we<br>put together one in rohingya and these<br>are the English translations and one in<br>Arabic targeting Syrian refugees in<br>Lebanon based on some work that we've<br>done in those contexts<br>the story here and this was based on the<br>work we did in Bangladesh was a young<br>girl talking to a mum and a mum<br>describing how sometimes she feels sad<br>her daughter's saying there are you know<br>things that we can control things we<br>can't control and then talking through<br>and communicating some of the stuff that<br>we found when we did interviews with<br>with members of that community<br>um the interesting thing there was you<br>know we were trying to understand the<br>community's views around physical<br>activity mental health coping and this<br>word that kept coming up was tension<br>and it's a really common idiom of<br>distress in in other cultures this idea<br>of tension and time and time again both<br>men women would tell us that when they<br>were able to participate in in physical<br>activity in sport there would be this<br>sense of Mind fresh and I just really<br>loved that word and that way of sort of<br>describing it<br>um and so again we've used that to try<br>to Advocate within the mental health<br>funders in the camp how can we create<br>opportunities<br>very deliberately focusing on women and<br>children because they are often ignored<br>and not in the picture when it comes to<br>sport yeah the able-bodied young men are<br>going to play they're going to find a<br>way to do it we actually need active you<br>know assertive interventions to reach<br>so the way I sort of think about it is<br>how do we get physical activity embedded<br>as a Specialized Service so coming back<br>to that pyramid how do we get it through<br>every layer of that pyramid and that<br>applies not just in Bangladesh but here<br>in New Zealand in Australia as well and<br>there's three things that we've we've<br>written about<br>culture training and I've spoken a lot<br>about training and also infrastructure<br>now I won't play that video but this was<br>in in Bangladesh in Cox's Bazaar after<br>we did some training for the mental<br>health staff there and this was their<br>idea we had a drone and they we went out<br>onto the beach it's the longest sea<br>beach in the world they drew a brain in<br>the sand and then they were doing<br>push-ups in the brain as the Drone flew<br>over and that was entirely their idea it<br>was how they wanted to sort of remember<br>what they had taken and what they how<br>they had thought about this sort of what<br>we were doing<br>the infrastructure is so critical and<br>I'd also include referral Pathways in<br>that yeah and the opportunities for<br>those training you know without some<br>level of infrastructure we can't expect<br>much to happen you know walking groups<br>will get us so far<br>all right this brings us to the the<br>final<br>um point which you know I'm I'm really<br>excited to be able to talk about as well<br>um Addison Road Community Center<br>and has anyone been to Addie Rowe or<br>heard of Valley Road Justin has<br>okay Addison Road is this incredible<br>place in Sydney in marrickville it's a<br>community organization that provides<br>essentially what they mostly deal with<br>is food insecurity so they've got a food<br>pantry but they've got about 60 Social<br>Services on site<br>gender-based violence marrickville Legal<br>Center indigenous Health Services<br>you name it it's there yeah I've always<br>had this sort of dream I've spoken to<br>Justin plenty of times about a<br>not-for-profit gym or like an exercise<br>space that was safe welcoming Finance<br>wasn't a barrier we could support people<br>to come<br>Addie road is the perfect place to do<br>that because people are already there<br>that co-location of services<br>so in December<br>2021 they gave us a building at Aldi<br>road which was fantastic so a few months<br>later we had this idea we need a bit of<br>a launch and we need some artwork to go<br>in the back of the gym<br>now this is Moz AZ zimbatar who's a<br>Kurdish refugee<br>who was detained by the Australian<br>government for eight years he was locked<br>up without charge him and I the exact<br>same age there was I while I was<br>studying and doing my PhD he was locked<br>in a room he was then in the Park Hotel<br>made famous by Novak Djokovic when we<br>wouldn't let him play tennis<br>um and that brought a bit of<br>international attention to this issue<br>now Moz is an artist and he didn't have<br>access to any painting supplies while he<br>was in prison he's also an Archibald<br>finalist now which is amazing what he<br>did have though was a toothbrush and<br>coffee beans so that's how we used to<br>paint he used to do his artwork with the<br>toothbrush and coffee<br>um so that's Moz then we have Maura<br>Farhad and Fahad from Afghanistan they<br>fled the Taliban last year came to<br>Australia and of course ended up at<br>Eddie Road doing a lot of work there<br>because that's sort of the power of that<br>he wrote<br>so at the launch event they got together<br>and painted this mural with the<br>toothbrushes<br>and that's now in the back in the back<br>of our gym<br>so that's what it kind of looked like<br>that's Dr Grace McEwen who's been<br>working with us this I took a couple of<br>days ago<br>um is what it looks like now<br>now the past 12 months we've been there<br>we haven't seen a single person we<br>haven't provided exercise to a single<br>service user<br>because we've gone through this really<br>slow and deliberate co-design process<br>okay so we want this to focus on on<br>women and women from a refugee<br>background who don't have access<br>so it's entirely free<br>um what we've done is we've interviewed<br>service users and service providers for<br>12 months we filmed those interviews we<br>analyze the transcripts we then made a<br>movie out of those interviews played<br>that movie back to everyone involved to<br>make sure that we had captured<br>everything and now we're writing that up<br>as a paper but it's given us a very<br>clear road map around what we need to do<br>to make services like this work safe and<br>accessible for those groups we're trying<br>to reach<br>um the second phase of what we did and I<br>can't stress this enough was we've just<br>finished our staff intervention<br>and we did this first at Southeast<br>Sydney local health district and we<br>published this data with 212 staff from<br>the Mental Health Service in Sydney<br>and before we rolled out this exercise<br>lifestyle program to patients we took<br>again another year and we just provided<br>it for staff<br>with the idea of trying to change the<br>culture of the mental health Workforce<br>so they understood what it was that we<br>were doing why we were doing that we're<br>not just going in saying everyone's<br>overweight and do some exercise yeah it<br>was a terrible message<br>um<br>I'll give you a quick example of the<br>impact of that staff intervention I had<br>a male nurse who had been there for 30<br>years and he got really frustrated with<br>me being there talking about this stuff<br>and he used to just get quite angry and<br>say look piss off if I wanted to be a<br>personal trainer I would have been a<br>personal trainer like leave me alone I'm<br>a nurse<br>as part of it we gave staff fitbits and<br>so we took about four weeks before he<br>found up and say<br>can I can I have one of those fitbits<br>like yeah of course he can someone gave<br>him one so he wasn't formally included<br>in the data<br>by week 10 he was coming and showing The<br>dietitian what he made for lunch<br>yeah so everything had changed around<br>him and he was kind of forced to jump on<br>board he then started walking and<br>talking sessions with the clients he was<br>working with so it completely shifted<br>now we're not going to have any<br>sustainable change within Mental Health<br>Services and we've seen it time and time<br>again unless we change the culture<br>within the staff and beginning with the<br>staff so you know my advice is if you've<br>got access to a pilot or somewhere to<br>this is my last slide psychological<br>first aid has three principles look<br>listen link it's really simple<br>we've now adapted that for the physical<br>activity stuff so look little link for<br>physical health so this is what we how<br>we're training for mental health<br>professionals looking for signs of<br>declining physical health weight gain<br>excessive sensory Behavior<br>listen and assess the idea that what<br>gets measured gets done so if we're not<br>measuring this how can we expect<br>anything to happen<br>um there are tools available that have<br>been specifically developed and this one<br>was you know huge role from Justin<br>involved in that<br>and then linking with local Services<br>providing mental health professionals<br>should be providing lifestyle counseling<br>or at the very least knowing how they<br>get access to it and supporting that<br>referral yep<br>clean referral Pathways physios EP<br>sporting clubs teams across every level<br>thinking about peer support and<br>co-delivery alongside with people lived<br>experience<br>I'll leave it there really happy to take<br>any questions and thanks again for<br>presentation thanks Simon uh he touched<br>on a few differences you talked about<br>refugees talked about different gender I<br>would be interested in the life course<br>approach to<br>mental health using physical activity<br>are there any recommendations from you<br>and observations in regard to barriers<br>yeah I would assume they're probably<br>working with lessons is quite different<br>working with Village People are the<br>elderly retired people any work being<br>done there yeah absolutely so starting<br>with starting with elderly people<br>there's a lot of work now looking at<br>Falls prevention programs the mental<br>health impact of those Falls prevention<br>programs because essentially if we're<br>getting people moving looking at balance<br>training the social interaction all<br>those things that are related<br>um are really important the<br>the other aspect around that is strength<br>training we really underutilize<br>resistance training as a modality<br>particularly for women particularly for<br>older adults<br>um we're doing you know sort of power<br>lifting with refugees as a as a strategy<br>you know resistance training is hugely<br>empowering can have a really big impact<br>needs to be supervised needs to be safe<br>but it's really underutilized for older<br>adults<br>um you know there's also the other<br>benefits around bone mineral density<br>diabetes insulin resistance<br>um<br>in terms of evidence around mental<br>health and older adults again Felipe<br>who's sort of the king of reviews<br>published a great review on older adults<br>depression and mental health a big<br>meta-analysis so the evidence is clear<br>the effect sizes are the same<br>um I think where I'm you know my work<br>with older adults is work moving into<br>the online digital stuff so things like<br>Facebook they're well engaged with<br>Facebook we've just finished a trial we<br>still had 40 drop out but that's low for<br>online interventions but a significant<br>impact on psychological distress after<br>so<br>any more questions<br>um yeah I just wondered if you've done<br>it's a collectivity and certainly for<br>young people whether actually making it<br>more formalized turns people off yeah<br>absolutely I think the critical thing is<br>how do we get people in the door<br>so whether it's<br>formal informal<br>um and I guess what we also mean by that<br>the<br>the yeah so<br>different differently are you talking<br>clinical like sort of young people<br>experiencing mental illness or is think<br>yeah yeah so I guess the the key thing I<br>think they both work<br>both can be really useful but I think we<br>need options available so if we just<br>have group based then I think people<br>that may be at risk are less likely to<br>engage or they're going to need extra<br>support in order to feel comfortable to<br>engage I think there's a long way that<br>we can go to make the informal Sport and<br>physical activity sectors safer cultural<br>psychologically culturally safer for<br>people that would go a long way so<br>probably actually catching a lot<br>um if we just have that one-on-one you<br>know I think there is a risk of over<br>medicalizing and over complicating this<br>stuff coming back to the key thing of<br>enjoyment you know we've got to make it<br>funner if they're not going to come you<br>know I think definitely in Australia<br>we've made lots of progress with the<br>sort of clinical exercise physiology<br>approach it goes too farther when you've<br>got someone with a white jacket and a<br>clipboard standing in someone from on a<br>bike I mean that will work for some<br>people older adults that might be great<br>younger people we need to think of that<br>otherwise but that's where I think also<br>just trying to flip that idea about we<br>don't always need<br>for physical activity in Mental Health<br>Services we can put the mental health<br>services where these people are meet<br>nothing else<br>all right um thank you very much for<br>coming through it's uh awesome um before<br>I let you go though I'd like to uh just<br>say thanks very much to vinco for<br>organizing uh this because uh without<br>without having it professionally done<br>um it wouldn't have happened very well<br>so thank you very much minko I also like<br>to thank Justin for outing his romance<br>with Simon to bring him over so it's<br>wonderful to see<br>um but Simon that was fascinating<br>um don't forget everyone next month<br>we've got Adrian coming through too so<br>that's awesome<br>um I'll just close off with a karakia<br>more uh<br>uh my motto uh<br>or matofano<br>yoga<br>thank you thank you all right thanks a<br>lot</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
