second session this afternoon<br>which as I alluded to just before at the<br>end of that last session is um looking<br>at education so it's a shame that we<br>didn't quite get the chance to tie in<br>those those previous questions but I'm<br>looking forward to some active<br>conversations during the break and<br>perhaps some of them will come up in our<br>our session after the break which will<br>be on governance as well<br>um I think that um all of us in this<br>room would agree that education is an<br>absolutely key contributor to<br>sustainable growth and productivity and<br>well-being and I'm sure that we all<br>agree that but it's a big cost to<br>government as as well and it's difficult<br>to get right including for the diverse<br>and perhaps even evolving student<br>population that it's serving so what<br>we're doing in this session is we're<br>turning to put schools under the<br>microscope<br>um with a particular focus on how we<br>turn around any things that need turning<br>around in those schools our panelists<br>for this session we're great it's it's<br>great that we've got a wealth of<br>experience here we've got our first<br>speaker will be Francis Valentine uh<br>Francis is the founder and CEO of<br>Academy x uh the Mind lab and Tech<br>Futures lab you might also have heard of<br>uh our second speaker will be Arwin Paul<br>uh Alwyn is the co-founder and the lead<br>of innovative education consultants and<br>our third speaker is Susan um Hassell uh<br>Susan is the Headmaster of Hamilton boys<br>high school so she'll be known to a<br>number of us in the audience those of<br>you that have got sons that have been to<br>Hamilton boys high school will be<br>familiar with Susan and the work that<br>she's done for an extended period of<br>time at Hamilton boys high school so I'd<br>like to pass straight to you please<br>differences<br>talking about the subject that's so<br>close to my heart<br>okay I've got it hopefully you can hear<br>me<br>um look I just want to start by picking<br>up on the last conversation around<br>demographics my role is to look at the<br>future needs of a Workforce and so<br>there's very much my focus of my<br>research and my activity and also at my<br>graduate schools and when we think about<br>demographics and education we cannot go<br>away from that right now we have a<br>significant shift in the way we are<br>thinking about training we have to think<br>about the types of jobs and how often<br>people will need to go back into the<br>workforce sorry back into training but<br>also if we start thinking about the<br>Aging population and where we are having<br>growth infertility which is in our Maori<br>Pacific in our immigrant communities and<br>so just an example I'll start with Tita<br>tokoro so the Northland of New Zealand<br>is a great example of what happens it's<br>our fastest growing region in the<br>country it is predominantly been<br>populated by retired pakiha and we have<br>a very large youth-based Maori<br>population<br>so the work that I've been doing up<br>there is really starting to focus on<br>what are the challenges there in<br>achievement what are how is the success<br>looking in terms of relevancy context<br>and actually what happens if you get it<br>wrong<br>and so if we start looking at a region<br>that is Advanced on the rest of the<br>country both in terms of where we're<br>going to be in terms of our population<br>being older and white<br>and then we start looking at the<br>challenges of climate change it's<br>already been impacted significantly in<br>the region and then the number of people<br>aotearoa but to leave to Australia<br>so the skill sets that we need we need<br>to be equal across all our demographic<br>groups<br>right now in 2023 we have 283<br>000 people over the age of 65 working<br>versus 85 000 in 2010. we're going to<br>live longer so we need to train multiple<br>times and so we have to think about<br>education not in this sort of<br>pre-loading just in the school system<br>but actually how do we get smart people<br>making strategic decisions throughout<br>our entire country so we do need to make<br>sure we have people studying going into<br>University and being highly skilled<br>so when I think of education and having<br>taught<br>in both in the compulsory sector on the<br>outside of the formal sector and also<br>now in the postgraduate space what I<br>note more than anything is the low<br>participation room we have<br>in education<br>so I'll start by talking about the<br>number of people in a country who go<br>into postgraduate study at Masters level<br>is just five percent<br>which is one of the lowest in the<br>developed world<br>we rely heavily on immigrants for our<br>top jobs we often talk about immigrants<br>coming in to take away or take on our<br>some of our low skill jobs but you only<br>need to look at the demographics and the<br>statistics around the types of roles<br>they take on which are often at the top<br>end of town they're making the most<br>strategic decisions on behalf of our<br>country<br>so for me when we go backwards to the<br>source of where this comes from<br>first of all it's a small Advanced<br>economy we have the biggest employer<br>is the government<br>the second biggest employer is a sole<br>Trader<br>so we don't have the International<br>Investment that other nations have you<br>know we run small businesses for a small<br>economy<br>the competitive nature of education is<br>not part of our DNA we rely on<br>International talent and capability in<br>many parts of our labor workforce<br>and then we have to talk about why do we<br>not value education<br>it goes all the way back into our<br>schools<br>and our schools right now are seeing<br>some challenges around record<br>absenteeism<br>context and relevance challenges<br>and we're starting to see that in a way<br>that we can only take and extrapolate<br>from that that if we don't do something<br>significant that actually more and more<br>people will opt out of participating<br>fully in education and then all of the<br>compounded effects that we're already<br>experiencing through<br>become even greater<br>I'll start by using an example of a<br>library<br>if you think about a library as a place<br>that we all spend time growing up as a<br>source and in many cases the only source<br>of factual information<br>we've seen how much they've had to Pivot<br>and recreate reimagine what a library is<br>today and now they're often places where<br>there is community participation there<br>are often technology that you can access<br>there's ways of collaborating<br>I went today and looked at the number of<br>roles for a Liberian in New Zealand<br>right now<br>seven and one of those is for a toy<br>Library<br>I looked at data management<br>which is fundamentally what we're<br>talking about with libraries and we have<br>over 600 jobs<br>and so libraries have moved on a long<br>way and they're looking at context and<br>relevance all the time and yet for some<br>reason education we hold on as though we<br>have the problem with the school and<br>instead of saying schools under the<br>microscope I'd like to put out their<br>students under the microscope because if<br>we took a user-centric customer focus<br>design for the education system we'd<br>look at young people today and say what<br>would make school relevant to them still<br>keeping the focus on quality of literacy<br>and numeracy digital fluency but making<br>sure they understand where it's taking<br>them in a world that today more than<br>ever we understand the impact of<br>Technologies such as artificial<br>intelligence and automation<br>and so if we don't take a<br>student-centric design we will continue<br>to argue the relevance of schools<br>and schools are merely in my world<br>buildings that house people to do<br>amazing things<br>so I'd like to pass over um to Owen or<br>um and and just just to leave it on that<br>note but I really want to think about<br>what does a student today need<br>so that when they hit 30 50 80 and then<br>a hundred<br>that they continue to learn and<br>education continues to be relevant fit<br>um<br>I'm one of those lucky people that<br>consider that I've never worked a day in<br>my life because I fell into teaching and<br>have loved every moment of it the<br>importance of it I think is graphically<br>Illustrated even in my family my mother<br>was born in 1934 into a home with 11<br>siblings in a state house in aramaha<br>wanganui uh I never meet my birth father<br>but my father-in-law who passed away a<br>few years ago he spent six years of his<br>young life in Holland under Nazi<br>oppression<br>um when we think about children standing<br>on the shoulders their parents those two<br>if they were still alive could look now<br>and see three of their grandchildren<br>through my family one is a fabulous<br>chemical engineer at regeneron in Albany<br>New York State one is a degree qualified<br>firefighter although I might say if you<br>own a home in remuera I'd think about<br>shifting and one a daughter who is about<br>to complete her PhD and I was going to<br>ask Matt really about an honorary PhD<br>for myself<br>I had a conversation with Ben Stokes on<br>Monday night and on the basis that made<br>some Investments on Tuesday morning and<br>I've got enough money to make a fair<br>donation to the management School<br>um<br>a couple of anecdotes in terms of of<br>teaching and what makes it interesting<br>and keeps me in it one day I had Rodney<br>Hyde in my office as the minister or<br>assistant minister of education and of<br>course children didn't think of him as a<br>politician they saw them as a dancer<br>and so while we're sitting in the office<br>a young man called Alex who now works<br>for an organization called will and Abel<br>heavily autistic and he's out sweeping<br>the path and he looks through the window<br>and he sees Rodney<br>and he puts down the broom and I say to<br>Rodney I'm not responsible for what this<br>boy says and uh so I see Alex stump<br>around come through the front door<br>across the foyer<br>looks Rodney up and down and says you're<br>Rodney height<br>and Rodney graciously acknowledged that<br>fact and Alex says you're a lot fatter<br>than you look on TV<br>and turned around and walked out<br>uh and I had to apologize but Rodney was<br>a good sport<br>I've taught a lot of quirky kids and I<br>love them and they have to find their<br>place in our New Zealand education<br>system remember another little boy<br>called Harry was sitting at one of the<br>front desks and I looked over and he's<br>eating a glue stick<br>I said Harry donate the glue stick you<br>make yourself sick and he says Mr Paul<br>it says here non-toxic<br>and I said well okay but if you eat too<br>much of it it'll go right through your<br>digestive system and stick your butt<br>cheeks together<br>and he says no when I sit down I just<br>pull those butt cheeks apart and I'm<br>fine<br>and these kids are everywhere in our<br>system<br>but in fact of the 815 000 kids in our<br>system they're all different and they<br>needed to be treated differently I had<br>the privilege of teaching my own<br>children I think one of the the huge<br>Solutions in our system is that teachers<br>teach as if every child is theirs and<br>bring the same standards to the table<br>there is no doubt that our education<br>system is in trouble there are two<br>reports that I released earlier this<br>week and are on your tables<br>and they add to the body of evidence<br>successive governments our Ministry of<br>Education and other interventions are<br>utterly failing<br>you can look at this from the<br>perspective of ethnicity or<br>socioeconomics or the growing Divergence<br>between the achievement of girls as<br>opposed to boys<br>but in each case we need to understand<br>that the whole of society suffers<br>we've often looked at education from the<br>point that well my kids were right 75<br>percent of kids are all right it's less<br>than that now<br>but in fact the impact on those children<br>is massive a lot of them will never rent<br>a good home<br>they will never save to buy they'll<br>never take an OE they won't grow up to<br>support their own family it is a massive<br>societal problem<br>there are great schools so in one of the<br>reports I've highlighted some of them o<br>for awesome Orange<br>and just one example Saint Paul's and<br>ponsonby four years ago the university<br>entrance for levers was 54 they're a<br>school that has 95 Maori and Pacifica uh<br>and through the leadership of Kieran fui<br>in four years they took the yui to leave<br>us for right up to 84<br>uh an exceptional effort<br>to me though the glaring solution is<br>parenting that is not to blame parents<br>for every issue but that's to say that<br>we now know through neuroscience and all<br>sorts of advances exactly what should<br>happen during the time a child develops<br>within the womb<br>exactly what should happen in the first<br>zero to three uh then three to five<br>years<br>but we don't apply it and many of our<br>families don't know it so the heaviest<br>thing that I'm advocating for and<br>hearing good responses on is that we<br>need a crown entity for parenting<br>not one that tells people what to do and<br>enforces it but one that spreads the<br>information about what good parenting<br>practices are I have never met a parent<br>in my 30 years of education that doesn't<br>love the child and want good things for<br>their child<br>but I've met thousands who don't know<br>how<br>and it's no longer an excuse thank you<br>yes I am Susan Hassel and thank you very<br>very much for having me this afternoon<br>Alan made the typical teacher's mistake<br>of handing out the reading material<br>while he spoke so I can ask you now as a<br>typical teacher to put your reading<br>material down and listen very carefully<br>to me for the next two and a half<br>minutes that Ellen has left me to speak<br>in my allotted five minutes so thank you<br>very much Alan uh I was I will speak<br>quickly because I come to this<br>perspective this afternoon as a<br>practitioner as a person who has<br>invested 40 years in a school I've been<br>Headmaster for 23 years so I've seen<br>iterations of the educational Journey<br>where many many initiatives have<br>occurred and I've lived through them<br>seen the impact of them on on their<br>young men so it's a real pleasure to<br>have this opportunity to speak with two<br>people who have have looked at it<br>through a different lens or a different<br>microscope if you like but but do have a<br>lot of wisdom and what they're offering<br>but I'm coming to it from a pragmatic<br>perspective of what matters most to our<br>young people in education at the moment<br>and I acknowledge there is a genuine<br>problem in our education system it's not<br>the problem that you might see reflected<br>in that data because my first point<br>really is that data is easily<br>manipulated and it and it doesn't<br>necessarily show the reality but there<br>is a genuine problem that both of the<br>people up here with me this afternoon<br>have highlighted in those and those<br>those problems have been exaggerate<br>exacerbated by covert but really just<br>highlighted by covert they've been<br>growing problems in our Secondary School<br>sector for some time and and as a person<br>who loves these boys and they are boys<br>in my case you see the impact of it and<br>it really is a point that New Zealand<br>has reached in terms of its economic<br>future from your perspective but in<br>terms of our social future that we have<br>to stop and look and see what else we<br>can do what we can do better and what we<br>can do differently but when I say that I<br>also believe very very strongly that<br>things aren't broken that there is so<br>much good in our education system there<br>are so many schools doing a wonderful<br>job you'll see some of those in the data<br>but you'll also see schools out there<br>who are just doing things well for our<br>young men and young women and what I do<br>want the point I do want to make to you<br>today as a practitioner of 40 years is<br>that young people are absolutely<br>wonderful they're on our side they want<br>to be with us as we make those<br>differences to their lives it's not a<br>problem that we need to start from<br>scratch is a problem that we need to do<br>like the repair shop does and take a<br>very chatty old chair and turn it into<br>something wonderful we can do that with<br>our education system as long as we all<br>work together and the need is in the<br>state system of Education in New Zealand<br>and the problem as in where the money is<br>brought<br>and where the money is put in education<br>this is my first tangent but my only one<br>is inter-ministry officials and where<br>the money isn't put us into the schools<br>and and that's my little moment of<br>having a political moment here in case<br>there's anybody who can make a<br>difference but how but the real question<br>is how can we turn it round how can we<br>turn around and it comes back I think to<br>the CH the question it's it is almost<br>rhetorical of what is the key purpose of<br>Education in a New Zealand Secondary<br>School in the 21st century post covert<br>what's our key purpose and there's a<br>pendulum in education it swings from one<br>side to the other and one at one side is<br>to prepare people for the workforce and<br>I'm sure many of you would think that<br>that's the right side that it should be<br>on at the other end of the pendulum it's<br>it's to prepare young people to become<br>good citizens<br>and at Hamilton Police High School we're<br>on that end of the pendulum we really<br>are and and there are many schools like<br>Hamilton Boise score I'm not going to<br>brag about our school but but the young<br>men that we graduate are not young men<br>who we're proud of as young men of 18<br>but that we're proud of the fact that<br>when they're 40 they're going to be good<br>citizens and from that flows all of the<br>other needs that New Zealand's facing at<br>the moment from that from that flows<br>academic success the will to try the<br>will to attend school<br>because they've got that sense of<br>character character as a word that has<br>reduced in our language by 800 percent<br>over the last 10 years we don't say the<br>word character anymore and yet it's one<br>of the critical needs for us as<br>Educators to think about as our<br>responsibility in the years ahead as we<br>come through post covert as we enter a<br>different world I think the key question<br>for the New Zealand Educators<br>educational people who who make a<br>difference and Mr Bulger asked me at<br>lunchtime if you had power what would<br>you do and I said I think I'd look at<br>the good schools what do we need to look<br>at under the microscope are the good<br>schools the schools that are succeeding<br>I want to set it to<br>why are those schools succeeding if you<br>look at the data in Owen's booklet don't<br>look at the voice High one because he's<br>completely wrong on that one but the<br>other ones many of them are Catholic<br>schools why Catholic schools succeeding<br>because the parents of those young men<br>come with a will for those young men to<br>succeed and see secondly because they<br>have a vision for character and a good<br>man and our vision at Hamilton boys high<br>school is to craft good men<br>and that has to come before anything<br>else and when we realize that then I<br>think all of the other things will<br>definitely fall in pla into place I I<br>absolutely believe that I believe it<br>after 40 years of being involved I think<br>that there is a deficit model that's<br>very dangerous<br>if we keep talking about the below the<br>line realities we lose track of the<br>above the line Solutions and it's so<br>important that students don't buy into<br>the below the line deficit and start<br>believing in it I don't tell Boys At<br>boys high that boys in New Zealand are<br>underachieving by 12 percent are when<br>they're compared to girls because that<br>would just make them think there was no<br>hope it would make them think that it<br>was okay to fail boys are wonderful at<br>only doing the limit that they have to<br>do to pass so if they get a merit they<br>think that was a bit of waste of energy<br>because they've done too much to just<br>surpass and they're wonderful in that<br>sense but we have to be very very aware<br>of how much they are hopeful and they<br>remain optimistic and they are the<br>people that are going to be leading this<br>country in 2050 and we have to get it<br>right and that's my one point this<br>afternoon I think to a group of people<br>who can make a change and make a<br>difference this is a one chance Post<br>cover to get it right we have to have<br>the courage the government has to have<br>the courage to say let's stop reset and<br>and re-look it and the two people who<br>are here with me this afternoon are both<br>absolutely correct as well but in the<br>end when as people ask me why is<br>Hamilton boys high school a successful<br>School while your young men are<br>successful assets because we love them<br>so much and they love us so much it's a<br>really really simple formula it's not<br>what I came here to talk about this<br>afternoon it's not even in my notes but<br>but it's all about the connection<br>with our young people and working with<br>them to make a difference thank you very<br>much<br>thank you very much<br>thanks very much to our speakers and our<br>may want to stick up for The Men Who<br>achieved for who aim for more than a<br>merit at some stage is the only man<br>sitting on the stage at the moment you<br>can you can mention can I can I speak to<br>you straight away you can briefly one of<br>the most stunning moments in my whole<br>teaching career as a practitioner for 32<br>years in a principal 4at uh was sitting<br>in a boys school not Hamilton boys but<br>in a boys school staff room when the<br>academic results were being reviewed at<br>the beginning of the the year and the<br>head of science stood up and he said<br>well you know our academic results are<br>ahead of the national average and we're<br>very proud of them and and the students<br>have done well and the head of math<br>stood up and and said pretty much<br>exactly the same thing and a head of<br>English stood up and the heat of English<br>was a woman and she said well our<br>results are behind the national leverage<br>but you must remember we are teaching<br>boys<br>I thought I was being punked my jaw<br>dropped open and I thought if I was down<br>the road at the matching girls school<br>and I said our science results are below<br>National leverage but you've got to<br>remember we're teaching girls I would<br>have been lynched uh and and that that<br>attitude it's not at Hamilton boys but<br>it is pervasive throughout our society<br>that boys don't read as much they don't<br>like reading you couldn't believe that<br>Tolkien and Lewis wrote great novels or<br>or all sorts of others I think we need<br>to have incredibly High aspirations for<br>hahaha<br>so what I'd like to do is ask some<br>questions we will take questions from<br>the floor shortly but we're just sorting<br>out some mic issues so I'm going to take<br>a few questions from slido but please do<br>sort out those<br>um uh those those questions that you'd<br>like to store up and ask us I'd like to<br>ask a question about future Focus I<br>think it's something that came through<br>in each of your preliminary comments or<br>your initial remarks<br>the question is what does future Focus<br>really mean<br>and then how can we achieve this in a<br>practical sense in education Rachel if<br>you just hold it a little higher the<br>receivers on the bottom of the mic so if<br>you hold it a bit higher<br>uh so look I'll start the day with given<br>it's my all my body of work<br>um over the last 25 years thinking about<br>the future and and actually it's<br>interesting because we do talk about<br>education as post-covered world I think<br>we have to talk about just this is the<br>normal world you know for those who<br>lived in in Tamaki Makoto or in tadafati<br>in Hawke's Bay right now covert has a<br>long past and they're thinking about the<br>more emergent climate issues our<br>students have dealt with more adversity<br>in the last few years some of them<br>haven't been to school for years and<br>have missed a critical time in their<br>schooling I think we really have to<br>understand the future fit means really<br>being able to be highly adaptable to<br>change and the change is just starting<br>and for someone who trained as a<br>technologist and then moved into<br>education<br>the technology piece of it for me is<br>still underpins all of my research that<br>we we can't even imagine if you take a<br>business trip and you go into a<br>comparative business of similar size<br>offshore you'll probably see Automation<br>and technology that you can't even<br>imagine and actually if we want to be<br>playing on the global stage our students<br>need to be thinking about technology in<br>a in a completely different way not as a<br>kind of a core body of knowledge but as<br>a tool that is a necessity at any type<br>of role it doesn't matter if you're a<br>personal trainer a chef or you're going<br>into you know accountancy firm every one<br>of those sectors now all reliant on<br>multiple different platforms multiple<br>different types of Technologies and one<br>of the things that we see when we hire<br>graduates from University there's still<br>a sort of an idea that technology sits<br>as a side piece that it's only for<br>developers it's only people who do com<br>science when the reality is everything<br>sits on platforms most business are now<br>paperless and working digitally remotely<br>with workforces that are distributed and<br>so we start to think about what that<br>looks like going forward and our<br>students how do they stay motivated if<br>they're going into workforces where<br>they're going to only be connecting<br>potentially with clients customers<br>colleagues in a digital world and so we<br>have to build those skills and<br>capabilities so that they are core to<br>their understanding and there's still a<br>big divide between what we're learning<br>and teaching in the school environment<br>in the University environment and it's<br>really up to now the workforce and of<br>course it's a difficult when workforces<br>are always hitting the ground running to<br>take time out and bring people up to<br>that skill set so I would put a real<br>play into you know constantly putting<br>technology of our time at the Forefront<br>you know we're having all this debate I<br>cannot tell you how many conversations<br>I've had with media in the last few<br>weeks about chat GPT you know everyone's<br>suddenly jumping up and down you know if<br>I talk to the average I've got four<br>children have just gone through the<br>school system and the University student<br>system they've been using AI for<br>everything you think of grammarly we've<br>been using that for years we use it<br>across all of our production of anything<br>from videos to audio to transcripts to<br>language dubbing you know creation of<br>digital art these things have been<br>around for a long time whole sectors<br>have been massively disrupted and so we<br>just need to make sure that we are<br>thinking about the types of jobs that<br>are coming up because it's not going to<br>be technology it's not going to be<br>technology in its own sake everything is<br>technology enabled and adjacent and so<br>we have to understand that's part of the<br>um just very briefly for the next five<br>years for a practical from a practical<br>stance for schools the curriculum<br>refresh should be completely thrown out<br>uh it will be a huge distraction for<br>schools they'll concentrate on that<br>rather than the children in front of<br>them uh the curriculum needs to be<br>simplified there is so much put into our<br>Curriculum by ideologues that is really<br>not relevant to children we want our<br>children to grow up free creative<br>informed thinkers not people who are<br>conforming to some nefarious group of<br>adults's view of the world I think<br>that's incredibly important and then the<br>second thing practically for schools I<br>think particularly<br>unless we change very strongly what's<br>happening in year 789 and 10 for<br>literacy and numeracy that the new<br>credits for literacy and numeracy that<br>you cannot get level one without will<br>have a massive impact on Lower<br>socioeconomic Maori and Pacifica<br>students that's not to say that the<br>credit aren't important but it's to say<br>we must change our teaching practice for<br>those four years leading up to it to<br>and that leads nicely on to my point<br>which is I think our Focus has to be<br>right in the center developing<br>resilience in our young people because<br>they've lived in a world for the last<br>three years where University entrance<br>has been much easier to get and and I'm<br>on the University Council here and you<br>see the results of that that come<br>students are coming in with the easier<br>UE and they're and they're finding it<br>much more difficult to finish their<br>first year at University so they we need<br>to expect our students to be well<br>educated by the time they leave that we<br>need to train them not to expect easy<br>options schools need to stop offering<br>soft UE subjects so that students can<br>get UE an easy way because you can I<br>could get a hundred percent of our<br>students through UE if I offered soft<br>subjects and we remain we remain<br>committed to to sustaining academic<br>focus in our classrooms and that needs<br>to happen we need to allow students to<br>fail more and we need to allow them to<br>learn from that failure and because<br>otherwise when they get into the real<br>world it's going to be a very very<br>frightening place for them and students<br>are very protected in our schools I<br>think and we have protected them through<br>covert it's been a very challenging time<br>but what we can learn from that is that<br>students can cope<br>you know they they can cope with with<br>sometimes not having life easy and and<br>they've been amazing through covert<br>they've they've Co they've just managed<br>very very well we our attendance<br>statistics didn't change at all through<br>covert really apart from those who had<br>covert and half of our school had covert<br>uh but but students just kept on wanting<br>to do the best they could but I think we<br>have as a whole society in New Zealand<br>moved away from developing that sense of<br>failure being a good thing and failure<br>being a part of life and that's what we<br>need to focus on in the next five years<br>is have high expectations have high<br>expectations in our literacy and<br>University the fact that over half of<br>the students that did the literacy trial<br>failed uh is is something that is a<br>testament to the fact that we need to<br>expect more of our students right from<br>year seven onwards and don't get started<br>on what the primary school is doing<br>wrong because you know we always blame<br>the level below us our University is<br>blaming secondary schools too so it's<br>just exactly the same so so that is a<br>really important part of it thank you<br>and as Susan was talking there I was<br>thinking to a university course one of<br>my own daughters thought about taking<br>which was called learning to fail but<br>she dropped the course because it turned<br>out that the failure rate was really<br>hard really high in this paper and part<br>of the learning was to actually fail a<br>lot of these students<br>um so I was thinking about about that<br>um and we have to be very careful with<br>the sort of incentives and Arrangements<br>we set up there were so many Rich<br>threads that came through that<br>discussion including on technology and<br>Ai and of course in the University we're<br>fascinated by this and I can see<br>questions coming through there are<br>questions on broader policy settings and<br>so on but I am going to invite if<br>there's anyone who's got questions from<br>here again sorry<br>um I just wanted to if you want talking<br>about blaming the ones below you but<br>would you like to comment on the early<br>years being the most formative towards<br>the enthusiasm for curiosity and<br>exploration and Imagination creativity<br>and the global Trend towards drop and<br>run daycare if you wanted to comment on<br>them<br>um<br>these uh obviously in in New Zealand<br>Nathan Wallace and comet in Auckland and<br>others have been doing some wonderful<br>work about they they're calling it the<br>first Thousand Days uh I work a little<br>bit with Nathan and with Comet and<br>um I'm calling it project 5.75 that we<br>in New Zealand care for our as I said<br>before our unborn and our first five<br>years<br>um and and there are people like<br>um I forget his first name David<br>Eagleman from Stanford University<br>probably the world's best communicative<br>neuroscientist<br>and again this this is all well known<br>and we need to kind of get it out and<br>and pervasively into our community but<br>it moves on I I've been astounded at the<br>current government's response to what is<br>a crisis in attendance and Susan's right<br>there are some schools where it hasn't<br>dropped off at all<br>but but to have a select committee we<br>are only eight out of two and a half<br>thousand schools submitted on the basis<br>of no evidence at all because they<br>didn't go out into schools to find out<br>why why some schools children are<br>attending or some schools they aren't<br>they spent 84 million dollars they've<br>just spent another 74 on no further<br>Evidence uh just to put 80 truancy<br>officers out there and on no single<br>occasion have they mentioned teacher<br>quality and school quality and making it<br>really necessary that schools are<br>worthwhile coming to the best the<br>education Review Office would could do<br>was say make it a bit more fun<br>kids can have fun at home and that's<br>what they're doing and I was very<br>interested talking to a decile 10<br>student recently from a private school<br>in central Auckland and is it during<br>covert we worked out that we didn't need<br>many of our teachers we could do it<br>ourselves sitting around a coffee table<br>and and all of this sort of stuff and so<br>it's not just in the lower decile<br>schools so schools and I think you know<br>many of the ideas up here already this<br>afternoon schools need to become<br>worthwhile places by tapping into all of<br>the good things that are now available<br>I thank you for that question I think<br>it's a really interesting one because<br>when we think about in those early years<br>probably growing up and maybe if you've<br>got older children there is a huge<br>amount of active play you know there's a<br>real focus on activity collaboration<br>creativity and Innovation and there is a<br>downside of Technology as well that's<br>come in where it's very easy to give an<br>iPad to a child and to find some other<br>ways of entertaining and so I think<br>we've got studies that are coming<br>through right now where there is a<br>direct collation between the you know<br>the overuse in the very early years of<br>technology and instead of keeping that<br>focus on creativity and I really really<br>call out Finland as an example of you<br>know one of the best education systems<br>in the world you don't start school two<br>or seven you stay with the same teacher<br>as a cohort and actually the focus is<br>really on outdoor play indoor play and<br>then that collaborative piece I think<br>there's a lot to learn but we also have<br>a country where you know we've talked<br>today about productivity where people<br>are dropping a daycare because they have<br>no other option it really is a many<br>people the only way you can get that<br>support and so it comes back to the<br>first thousand days we know is critical<br>that they learn you know the idea with<br>words and and colors and form and and so<br>much of that comes from home and as we<br>distribute our families across the world<br>that gets harder so we have to really<br>seek it out and understand that and so I<br>think part of it is we're in an early<br>phase of knowing not knowing enough<br>about the effects I think we'll know a<br>lot more and we'll probably look back at<br>this time and wonder what we did for<br>some of this over overuse over<br>stimulation but I think also we do need<br>to kind of catch ourselves all of us<br>with our view across education because a<br>lot of the things we we hold on to we<br>know we forget the good things about the<br>past and we should bring some of those<br>through and we also forget to adopt the<br>good things in the future and so we need<br>that right across all parts of the<br>sector<br>you know I think if you turn that<br>question upside down it's really<br>important to retain that sense of awe<br>and wonder that our student our young<br>people have in those first thousand days<br>right through to the end of year 13 and<br>that's what uh it needs to be a goal<br>that our 18 year olds have the same<br>sense of awe and wonder that we should<br>be cultivating in young people right<br>from the start and that and we did that<br>then I think would be quite a different<br>Society quite a different world and<br>people would be so much happier and that<br>would bring all of the associated<br>benefits with it and let's not stop at<br>18 let's keep going we have to we have<br>to have the um these 18 year olds when<br>they move on to their next phase if<br>there's other questions in the room<br>University of Canterbury I first of all<br>would like to thank Spanish for a very<br>stimulating discussion<br>but I would like to add uh and ask for<br>it for a comments I I hear a lot of<br>about technology<br>from the panelists but you know during<br>class 100 200 years each generation was<br>living in a time of a new new technology<br>technology is<br>no more than another tool<br>and I would like to heard from the<br>panelists how the schools should address<br>the problems which young people face on<br>on a social social scene how schools<br>should build the attitudes so let's not<br>forget that<br>attitude builds the altitude<br>and<br>I have impression that you know<br>we all like to probably can agree here<br>that schools should teach how to remain<br>a learner for most of your life but how<br>the school should contribute to the<br>bills of attitudes which uh seems to be<br>missing in this discussion thank you<br>I'm sure season yes I I predicted the<br>microphone might go to you first<br>well I say it is a very important<br>question I think and everybody will<br>agree with me it's about educating<br>people to use the tools that we have<br>well just as have as we've been doing<br>since the stone ages really I mean we<br>just have different tools and they're<br>just as they're just as powerful if<br>we're talking about AI I have a fellow<br>Headmaster and another boys school who<br>uses chat GPD GP GPT to writers assembly<br>talks now yes so so he thinks it's<br>wonderful so uh and and and we do have<br>to use that as a tool we need to develop<br>an understanding of how we can use it as<br>a tool but it comes back to that sense<br>of crafting good citizens I mean I I<br>will sound repetitive because I think<br>it's an important point that we need to<br>craft citizens who understand how to use<br>the tool of their age you know and and<br>we have to also understand C.S Lewis's<br>notion of chronological snobbery that we<br>all in our own age think that our way is<br>the best way but sometimes we have to go<br>back and we have to look at at the best<br>of the past and and the best of the past<br>was to create a young man who had that<br>sense of RTA of being the best he could<br>be in all aspects of his life one of the<br>aspects is technology but there are all<br>the other things that matter so much uh<br>as well so it's about crafting from the<br>age of of two I have a two-year-old<br>grandson and he's only happy when he<br>watches Bluey which is a ghastly little<br>cartoon program that the rest of us<br>can't stand anymore because we see so<br>much of it what are we doing wrong we<br>know we're doing wrong but it's no<br>different from having one of those<br>little things on a crib that went round<br>and round 25 30 years ago we're still<br>doing it's all about stimulus it's all<br>about using the tools that we have in a<br>positive way and in a measured way does<br>that answer the question I'll pass on to<br>Alvin's I'll pass on to Alvin so he can<br>answer the question I've got another<br>question for you Owen so if you don't<br>want to answer this one you can pass to<br>Francis<br>I still like SpongeBob<br>um but one thing that we haven't mention<br>here is uh activity and uh sporting<br>activity physical activity every day for<br>children I do quite a lot of work with a<br>great New Zealander Rod Dixon it's 40<br>years since he won the New York Marathon<br>he's got a Kids Marathon program that we<br>put out into primary schools getting<br>kids out and and active every single day<br>competitive losing sometimes winning<br>sometimes I thought the English cricket<br>team as as you know keeping in mind I<br>made a lot of money off them I think<br>that their response to losing on Tuesday<br>was incredible<br>and you know that sort of character from<br>from physically competing is really<br>just back to the technology question in<br>terms of evolution of technology I think<br>what we need to be really mindful of is<br>how fast it's changing and I know it's<br>easy to say we've always have<br>technological advancement and we've gone<br>through different areas in Industrial<br>Age and moving into the digital age<br>I'll just use the example we've talked<br>about the gbt to get 100 million users<br>of a telephone the analog telephone that<br>said in our desk that we dialed took 75<br>years so from the time was first<br>invented we had to get lines and the<br>telephones and the technology and the<br>telephonus and the exchanges<br>to get to 100 million users on gbt took<br>24 days<br>and of those hundred million 25 million<br>of it use it daily<br>now so this is how fast it's changing if<br>we think about something like Pokemon go<br>which was the very first mainstream AR<br>tool that came out a few years ago and<br>you may have had family members chasing<br>Pikachus around the neighborhood the<br>same thing happened it happened with an<br>immediate adoption because they already<br>had the phone or the iPad the technology<br>existed it was an overlay and I think<br>this is where the distribution of<br>technology is so fast so just this uh<br>just this week has come out that now we<br>have 3.4 devices per person on the<br>planet<br>so just a few years ago it was less than<br>one and so at the speed of which the<br>internet is is now uh overtaking what we<br>can possibly do the advances are going<br>to be incredibly rapid we cannot pretend<br>that this stuff is not happening out<br>there the advances and the cognitive<br>advances as we support ourselves with<br>technology will change the future of our<br>workplaces and our jobs and our careers<br>and if we start looking today if what I<br>say with my graduate schools we we have<br>professionals who study with us we say<br>look at your job and now go to the<br>Silicon Valley work website<br>and find the same title and see if you<br>could do that look at the job<br>description and if you could do that job<br>and everyone gets horrified because they<br>realize what they're asking for for the<br>same role in a more advanced economy is<br>fundamentally different we have to look<br>at other countries we have to understand<br>the speed of which this is going to<br>change the way we we operate as a<br>country if we're going to stay globally<br>competitive<br>thanks Francis I'm going to ask a<br>question from slido but do keep waving<br>out if you've got questions from the<br>floor oh and I'll start with you on this<br>one and The Others May like to add to it<br>how can we best serve the needs of a<br>wide range of children including gifted<br>and neurodiverse<br>children I think this is something you<br>had an interest in well my Master's<br>Degree was in teaching gifted and<br>talented children and I've thrown most<br>of that theory out<br>for a whole range of very good reasons<br>but the main one being that first of all<br>two main ones first of all if you label<br>five percent of your population or<br>School population has been gifted you're<br>labeling 95 as being non-gifted and I<br>don't think that's acceptable and then<br>the second part of it is that there is<br>no longer a strongly held view that<br>human ability is a fixed construct in<br>fact when children come into the two<br>schools at South and West Auckland that<br>helped establish and we did ESL tests<br>and we would find an average they were<br>two years behind I would insist to my<br>staff members that they regard that<br>period of time that they need to catch<br>up that they would regard that they're<br>behind because of environmental reasons<br>not because of internal ability reasons<br>the second thing I mean neurodiverse<br>Learners I I just love us those<br>anecdotes I mean I remember having<br>another meeting and we were at that<br>stage building character and so we were<br>talking to the students about what they<br>do for their parents and I said to them<br>in the meeting this morning Monday<br>morning anyone put your hand up what did<br>you do for your parents on the weekend<br>that was just fantastic and an 11 year<br>old girl put a hand up Millie and she<br>said I'll let my mum go out cougaring on<br>Saturday night<br>and we all just looked and I said okay<br>end of the meeting off to class<br>um but one of the neat things in that<br>school environment was it wasn't one<br>rule for all each person was seen<br>individually and sometimes in a<br>classroom there needs to be a different<br>role for a child who sees the world in a<br>different way and one of the great<br>disappointments from a from a straight<br>professional perspective over uh three<br>years we asked the labor government to<br>allow us to establish a 480 student<br>school near a transport Hub in central<br>Auckland for neurodiverse Learners as a<br>designated character school and the<br>Ministry of Education say no and then<br>try and work out the reasons why and<br>it's simply not acceptable and those<br>children need that kind of service<br>Susan if I can tune<br>to season for a question please<br>um what's the role of vocational success<br>alongside academic success<br>of vocational well they're equally<br>important there are so many types of<br>success which are important<br>I'm not sure what the question really<br>means other than for me to say that it's<br>so obvious that they are that there used<br>to be a system you know we those of us<br>have been around a long time remember<br>the vocational schools vocational<br>Pathways schools and now schools are<br>expected to be all things to all people<br>and so it is a very real challenge for<br>us we we have students at Hamilton boys<br>high school doing level three music up<br>here at University and we have students<br>who are really working very very hard<br>over four years to get level one through<br>a vocational pathway so it's the<br>diversity of our Learners that really is<br>a key part of what we have to do and<br>we're setting our goals establishing our<br>goals vocational pathways are a key<br>aspect of ensuring that all students can<br>have success because that is their area<br>of strength first 15 rugby is an area<br>which is a vocational pathway now so the<br>whole notion of vocational Pathways has<br>changed over the years because people<br>can make their careers in such a wide<br>spectrum of ways from a young man who's<br>finishing his level three music at<br>University because he did his letters<br>when he was in year 9 out to a young man<br>who's going to work very very hard to<br>have the skills to be able to work on<br>the roads when he leaves school when<br>he's 17. the other thing about secondary<br>schools is that they used to be like a<br>triangle when I was at school you know<br>year 13 was a small group and now<br>they're a rectangle<br>students are staying at school longer<br>the needs of our students are changing<br>and and I come back to my point at the<br>very beginning that crafting good<br>citizens is what it's all about and and<br>ensuring that that they can have a<br>meaningful pathway all the way through<br>there are some wonderful programs to run<br>by the ministry Gateway trades academies<br>they're too small they're underfunded<br>everything is underfunded and and that's<br>the tragedy for these young women and<br>young men we we've got 80 people on a<br>Gateway program we could have 150 we<br>have a roll of 2 300 and and it could<br>easily be 200 150 to 200 young men in<br>those programs but we get what we're<br>funded to get and that's the end and<br>that's in that c and we use some of our<br>international student funding to ensure<br>that more young men who need vocational<br>Pathways get them<br>the covert has shown so dramatically<br>that schools cannot exist without<br>international student students and<br>that's another aspect of the<br>underfunding which is which is really<br>quite frightening for us and we're<br>looking in those Futures because the<br>needs as Owen says you know it's not<br>just your neurodiverse it's just the<br>broad range of young people's needs that<br>we do need to meet and the future and<br>when I talk about stepping back and<br>resetting what education is all about<br>then that's what those are the things we<br>need to consider of what's the best way<br>in which we as a very small country can<br>work it out so that we're doing the very<br>best we can for all of those diversities<br>thank you<br>we're almost out of time well I'm going<br>to ask one very brief question that<br>you're allowed 10 seconds to respond to<br>if money were no problem<br>what would you do different season do<br>you want to start with that one just a<br>you just talked about money in your last<br>uh yeah if money was no problem I'd<br>probably sack half of the people in<br>Ministry uh and and divert that so there<br>was even more money in schools uh if<br>money was was no problem I think we<br>would need to<br>um<br>really really look at the good schools<br>we would have the courage to get rid of<br>some of the schools that are really<br>struggling we would educate school<br>principals in genuine leadership and we<br>would<br>Pay Teachers what they deserve to be<br>paid so that we would get a stronger<br>teaching Workforce and if we had a<br>stronger teaching Workforce we'd have a<br>stronger economy and it's as simple as<br>that in the end teachers work very very<br>hard whatever you may think about us<br>that we get 14 weeks holiday a year that<br>we go home at 3 15. as it is genuinely<br>not true teachers work very very hard<br>and and they deserve to be paid a living<br>wage and that's the trouble when you've<br>got first year teachers still earning 56<br>000 and they've taken four or five years<br>to get their degree it's not good enough<br>thanks thanks Susan and Alwyn you can<br>see Susan's got a bit of a shopping list<br>there including some things she'd get<br>rid of but a brief uh what would you do<br>money's No Object 10 seconds because<br>we're over time I'm prepared to become<br>the secretary for Education uh I'm a man<br>of simple taste so I'll save the<br>education system uh 284 000 by doing it<br>at half the price uh of the current<br>employee<br>um and let's start<br>and I would make sure that all policy<br>makers are really well informed about<br>the big shifts that are happening in the<br>world starting with the demographics<br>here and what the impact will be into<br>the future<br>thank you very much well you know we've<br>had wonderful presentations from Francis<br>from Owen and from Susan a hugely Rich<br>insights during the discussion that<br>followed so thanks very much to our<br>panelists for uh wonderful presentation<br>sometime</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
