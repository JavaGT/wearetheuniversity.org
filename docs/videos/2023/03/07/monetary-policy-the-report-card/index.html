them very much for joining us our<br>first panelist has already been<br>mentioned by his boss this morning uh<br>Paul Conway is the chief Economist of<br>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand we've<br>then got Cameron bagri who is the<br>managing director and chief Economist at<br>Bagley economics Christina lung is the<br>principal Economist at New Zealand<br>Institute of economic research nzir many<br>of us know it it has and finally another<br>of my colleagues Professor Frank<br>scrimger from economics at waikato<br>management School<br>and with that we'll pass straight to you<br>please Paul five minutes info remarks<br>from everyone thank you<br>foreign<br>great conference so far I've been really<br>enjoying it even though the material<br>we're dealing with is uh we have many<br>issues in front of us<br>um so yeah I'm going to speak five<br>minutes on monetary policy we've already<br>heard from the governor so the session<br>monetary policy uh the report card it<br>kind of makes me feel a little bit like<br>I'm back at Southland boys high school<br>in the 80s uh getting my report card but<br>anyway it's cool to be here and I'm<br>really looking forward to hearing what<br>the other panelists have got to say and<br>what you've all got to say about our<br>review and assessment of the formulation<br>and implementation of monetary policy<br>which is a hefty 120 page document that<br>we put out at the end of last year that<br>reviewed monetary policy over the five<br>years to October uh last year now of<br>course a report card it's all about<br>looking back and assessing how we've<br>gone assessing performance so that we<br>are better placed to move forward and<br>that's exactly what raphampton we call<br>it reference for short is all about and<br>in fact the whakato on the cover of that<br>document translates into look back and<br>reflect so you can move forward that's<br>very much what I'm interested in here<br>today the Reserve Bank we're required by<br>legislation to review our monetary<br>policy actions every five years that's a<br>new review under the new act and rafam<br>is the first example of us fulfilling<br>that uh Mandate of course the bank has<br>done plenty of business cycle reviews uh<br>over the years but raphamp is far more<br>comprehensive and I do encourage you to<br>have a have a look at it it's it's a<br>document that we're quite uh proud of<br>and quite pleased with there are three<br>main sections to the report so the first<br>one provides context it covers changes<br>in the monetary policy framework that<br>occurred over the five years so this is<br>the Dual mandate the establishment of a<br>monetary policy committee etc etc<br>there's also a bit in there on economic<br>conditions are going into the review<br>period so falling neutral interest rates<br>so neutral interest rates interest rates<br>that are not contractionary or<br>expansionary and they've been declining<br>globally and in New Zealand heading into<br>that review period and also headline<br>inflation in the bottom half of the<br>target band does anyone remember those<br>days they're starting to feel like a<br>long time ago now the second section of<br>this review it looks at monetary policy<br>in real time so a big focus on the data<br>that's actually in front of the monetary<br>policy committee as decisions are being<br>made for me involved in the writing of<br>it it really brought back memories of<br>the the health and economic emergency<br>that we were all living through at that<br>time it was a pretty scary period and a<br>very fast-moving environment for all of<br>us monetary policy makers included over<br>that time I just want to say you know<br>Bank staff and many other people across<br>the public sector were working<br>um super hard out incredibly hard and<br>some people are still recovering from<br>that period now we draw lessons from<br>this real-time review of monetary policy<br>I'm just going to tick through some of<br>those first you know fiscal and monetary<br>actions averted worst case scenarios so<br>economic Armageddon which was widely<br>kind of predict projected or forecast at<br>the time at the time was avoided you<br>know economic growth it's been extremely<br>volatile but it's actually been<br>relatively strong over the pandemic a<br>little too strong as it happens another<br>lesson from that period is that a clear<br>understanding of fiscal policy is<br>critical for getting monetary policy<br>right so in 2020 new fiscal policy rules<br>were being designed and rolled out at<br>PACE and monetary policy had to be<br>across those so this is about a high<br>trust environment across Treasury and<br>The Reserve Bank which I think we've<br>largely got and also a good<br>understanding across number one and<br>number two the terrorists of course<br>without out compromising operational<br>Independence and not sort of conflating<br>the roles of monetary and fiscal policy<br>another lesson from this part of the<br>report is that additional monetary<br>policy tools amp tools so the LSAT<br>program in particular worked extremely<br>well in correcting Financial dysfunction<br>at this time that was incredibly<br>important then it would have been an<br>economic an even bigger economic<br>disaster if our debt markets had seized<br>up preventing governments and corporates<br>from borrowing another lesson from this<br>section of the paper is as the governor<br>alluded to this or spoke about this<br>morning is that monetary policy could<br>have been tightened earlier in 2021 in<br>which case we'd be dealing with a bit<br>less inflationary pressures now<br>now the third section of the report it<br>takes a step back and it looks at the<br>conduct of monetary policy over the<br>five-year period as a whole this<br>includes an initial assessment of the<br>broader effects of aemp tools and I say<br>initial because that story around QE<br>around quantitative easing it has a long<br>way to run and it's going to be the<br>subject of a great deal of scholarly<br>attention uh over coming years and<br>decades now again we draw a number of<br>important lessons from this part of the<br>paper I'm not going to go through them<br>all but just for example amp tools were<br>successful in providing monetary<br>stimulus so our best estimates are that<br>alsaps<br>lowered longer term interest rates to<br>the tune of 50 to 100 basis points and<br>also the funding for lending program the<br>flip also lowered interest rates by 20<br>basis points or more but it could have<br>been designed with more flexibility such<br>as an early termination clause<br>and by lowering interest rates amp tools<br>resulted in higher than otherwise<br>economic activity and inflation so they<br>were stimulatory but it's hard to<br>quantify the net economic benefits of<br>these tools whereas the mark to Market<br>costs or the accounting costs of holding<br>government bonds is straightforward to<br>measure and we publish it monthly in the<br>interest of transparency now let me<br>finish just by saying that that Lessons<br>Learned are only useful to the extent<br>that they lead to Future improvements in<br>monetary policy making looking back so<br>that we can move forward so we highlight<br>nine areas for improvement in rafimp<br>I'll summarize these<br>develop broader insights into the<br>impacts of Supply shocks on inflation so<br>this is get a better understanding of<br>the economic environment that monetary<br>policy is likely to be operating in in<br>future develop new sources of data for<br>economic monitoring as Dr Graham Scott<br>noted yesterday there's a data<br>Revolution going on and we need to be<br>right into that especially given that<br>our official data can be lagged and a<br>bit patchy develop better measures of<br>neutral interest rates so this is about<br>you know as crucial and understanding<br>the starts of monetary policy understand<br>the role of fiscal policy instruments in<br>managing economic shocks<br>um refine our measures of Maximum<br>sustainable employment so MSE we did a<br>survey it's not particularly well<br>understood so we need to improve that<br>and we need to communicate that better<br>use lsaps to mitigate Financial Market<br>dysfunction they work in that space but<br>be cautious about providing forward<br>guidance in uncertain times things can<br>change quickly almost by definition and<br>maintain the OCR as a preferred tool for<br>setting monetary policy but maintain<br>operational Readiness across amp tools<br>again as the governor mentioned this<br>morning we are looking or we are<br>building a research agenda around these<br>improvements uh which will determine<br>what we are working on over the next few<br>years and again as Adrian made clear<br>this morning we want to partner with the<br>academic Community uh anyone really uh<br>that can help with that both<br>domestically and internationally so I'm<br>planning on visiting all the<br>universities in our country over the<br>next few months speaking with staff and<br>students and putting that research<br>agenda in front of them and looking for<br>collaboration opportunities we're going<br>to get macro conferences back up and<br>running sponsored by The Reserve banker<br>and partners we're going to get<br>International Economist back visiting<br>New Zealand to give us their insights<br>and Reserve Bank staff are going to get<br>back to relevant International and<br>domestic conferences to present our work<br>and get feedback so in short and just to<br>finish we are back in business and look<br>forward to engaging with you all as we<br>move forward and let's get on with it<br>because you know as we've heard over the<br>last day and a bit we have some massive<br>challenges in front of us navigating<br>Heavy Seas indeed thank you<br>thank you very much Paul Cameron<br>uh where do I start<br>there was an article I read a couple of<br>weeks ago in a newspaper the journalist<br>will remain nameless but<br>the person thought that inflation the<br>cost of living would not be the key<br>election issue of 2023.<br>in the past 48 Hours we've received the<br>ipsos issues monitor<br>and guess what inflation the cost of<br>living is the key issue and it's the key<br>issue by an absolute country mile<br>65 percent of new zealanders put<br>inflation as a top three issue the next<br>most important issue is the second Equal<br>Housing at 33 percent and crime Law and<br>Order at 33 percent<br>rather frightening education is number<br>11 on the list and people are more<br>concerned about the cost of filling up<br>their car with petrol and the standard<br>of our education system I thought I'd<br>make four or five<br>this little broad points look number one<br>if you look at the thrust of what the<br>reserve being stunned over the past five<br>years and the conclusions of the review<br>they broadly got it right<br>that we really know where we were going<br>the answer was hell no you know so you<br>had to go and you had to go big and if<br>there's question marks that I think need<br>to be asked they're around<br>won the funding for lending program<br>and I just saw ASB expanded their<br>margins by 33 basis points in their last<br>Financial results which is one hell of<br>an expansion and two the enthusiasm for<br>negative interest rates from the rbnz<br>relative to a close peer such as the RBA<br>but that's it the other the broad thrust<br>and the recommendations that came out in<br>the review looked pretty Rock Solid our<br>point to avian talked about trade-offs<br>and we are going to head in the next two<br>years into an awkward period where those<br>trade-offs are going to come to Bear you<br>know the reserve banks predicting the<br>dreaded recession I like to call it a<br>reset because that's a little more<br>optimistic and less pessimistic but<br>still highlights challenges<br>at the same time inflation is still<br>going to be up around six percent<br>now that sort of leads me into point<br>three as we get into<br>these trade-offs<br>one of the things that you know I look<br>back at the past few years that I'm not<br>sure<br>The Reserve Bank included it<br>sufficiently within their discussions<br>and it's it's difficult yeah because<br>it's not part of your remit it's not<br>part of the Playbook etc etc but it's<br>the whole concept of your Social license<br>yeah and doing your job<br>you've still got to have Society on<br>board<br>and one of the things that worries me<br>globally at the moment is that as the<br>economic costs of containing inflation<br>come to beer<br>I a negative growth falling house prices<br>and unemployment going to I think you're<br>5.7 something like that<br>yeah that's an awful lot more people on<br>the job Seeker benefit and there's going<br>to be social consequences of that and I<br>think there's going to be pushback<br>yeah so the the path of least regret<br>might have been appropriate but there<br>was a risk<br>that that could create challenges on the<br>other side as Society I think is going<br>to start to point the finger<br>and I'm trying to think about how that<br>is going to get shaped the second point<br>or the second question I've got is one<br>that Central Bankers probably don't want<br>to talk about but do we have the right<br>inflation Target<br>there's one to three percent the right<br>number<br>yeah we we now live in a world of<br>repeating Supply shocks we're seeing big<br>structural changes across the labor<br>market around the globe<br>I suspect globally there is going to be<br>the temptation as the economic costs are<br>containing inflation increase<br>people are going to want to<br>perhaps move the goal posts uh the third<br>Point Adrian brought it up was that<br>about the importance of credit meet<br>intermediation this is what we call the<br>credit channel of monetary policy which<br>is a fancy word to get in the banking<br>system right<br>we're going to not going to make a<br>prosperous more affluent New Zealand by<br>selling more expensive houses to each<br>other<br>and there's some deep rooted structural<br>questions that need asked about the<br>process of financial intermediation<br>across New Zealand and Paul I see you<br>spoke up the other day about supporting<br>the Commerce Commission in regard to<br>driving more competitive pressure good<br>on you for for taking that view the<br>final question I have is this<br>interaction between monetary policy and<br>fiscal policy<br>yeah we know what fiscal policy<br>technically needs to do the Reserve Bank<br>needs mates well<br>the government of the day<br>is facing the reality of 30 years of<br>under investment across critical<br>infrastructure in New Zealand<br>so that's the long game addressing those<br>infrastructure needs through probably<br>one of the biggest investment booms<br>we're ever going to see versus the near<br>Team Challenge of tightening the belt<br>and monetary policy and fiscal policy<br>are going to go head-to-head uh 0.4<br>final one just some small suggestions in<br>regard to fine-tuning<br>there's some examples of fine tuning I<br>think a biggest belief why New Zealand<br>does not have a monthly CPI number the<br>biggest belief why we actually don't<br>know what the migration figures are in<br>New Zealand because we don't know until<br>people don't come back in 12 months so<br>at the moment it's pure guesswork and<br>the final thing is that you know and<br>Paul talked about this we need a better<br>understanding of fiscal policy<br>you know fiscal policy is a big game in<br>town for the next 10 years and I don't<br>see an awful lot of economic analysis<br>commentary on fiscal policy I see an<br>awful lot of commentary on monetary<br>policy thank you<br>thanks Cameron Christina<br>Kira thanks for having me here so um<br>when I was asked to talk about the in<br>five minutes<br>um what's been going on over the past<br>five years it really was like well<br>clearly we've been through some pretty<br>unprecedented um times with the covert<br>pandemic obviously and also more<br>recently the floods and the Cyclone<br>Gabrielle now in terms of thinking about<br>what that all means for monetary policy<br>certainly from the supply side it's<br>created a lot of changes prior to the<br>pandemic<br>um we've had prices but be I always in<br>economics we always talk about it always<br>comes back to supply and demand and<br>previously in normal times what you<br>would have is when there's been a sharp<br>increase in prices naturally that's an<br>indication for more resources to be<br>allocated to that area in which case<br>then to increase in Supply would lead to<br>an easing in inflation from that but<br>with the pandemic and the physical<br>constraints preventing the dose that<br>mobility of resources from happening in<br>that adjustment what that boiled down to<br>was very high inflation and then of<br>course added on top of that was that um<br>unprecedented stimulus which stimulated<br>demand which then created that perfect<br>storm for inflation now in terms of what<br>it means clearly in hindsight<br>um monetary policy was too loose for too<br>long but that's in very uncertain times<br>that's to be expected that for the<br>policy makers we were in times where we<br>a lot of decisions had to be made<br>quickly and that was what resulted also<br>looking at our nzie quarterly server<br>business opinion it really highlights<br>all the hitwinds that were facing the<br>economy even prior to the extreme<br>weather events that we've had business<br>conference at Rick lows with labor<br>shortages being the main concern for<br>many of the businesses so<br>certainly there were a lot of these um<br>things that were already challenging for<br>the New Zealand economy now on top of<br>that Fuller Reserve Bank a lot of the<br>challenges in that lagged transmission<br>of monetary policy which uh Governor or<br>commented on earlier this morning now<br>um the former U.S treasury secretary<br>Larry Summers he uses this analogy and I<br>think it's a great analogy and I wish I<br>came up with it of monetary policy being<br>like a wonky Hotel shower so here you<br>are in the shower trying to crank up the<br>Heat and the hot water is yet to come<br>through so you're just cranking up the<br>heat wanting that um and then finally<br>when it all arrives you get scolded now<br>for economies such as the US and New<br>Zealand we're a large proportion of<br>Mortgage Debt is on fixed term mortgage<br>rates this lag transmission of monetary<br>policy is particularly relevant because<br>you're having these um over a year on<br>from when the Reserve Bank first started<br>increasing the OCR we're yet to fully<br>feel the impact of that across many of<br>the borrowers over the coming year we're<br>going to have half of mortgages due for<br>repricing so many of these households<br>will be moving from fixed term mortgage<br>rates of two to three percent onto<br>something significantly higher of over<br>six to seven percent so that will mean a<br>significant increase in mortgage<br>repayments for many of these households<br>and we're all likely to see an<br>adjustment in spending as a result of<br>those mortgage payments crowding out<br>areas of discretionary spending now<br>um Adrian talked about earlier this<br>morning talked about the Central Bank<br>needing to be reactive to the<br>circumstances and certainly that's true<br>for a lot of the circumstances that are<br>beyond the central banks control the<br>unforeseen circumstances that we've seen<br>with the pandemic uh the extreme weather<br>events but there is also<br>um that need to be recognizing that in<br>terms of the monetary policy and the lag<br>transmission of that what that should<br>mean in terms of inflation pressures<br>later on and being mindful of the risk<br>of over correction on the way up as well<br>as on the way down now to be clear High<br>inflation is very damaging for the<br>economy and certainly from coming here<br>as a as an immigrant in the 1990 during<br>that time when inflation was very high<br>and having um see my parents with<br>savings and worrying about the<br>purchasing power of those savings being<br>eroded away over the years um certainly<br>I can see the damaging impact that high<br>inflation has on well-being but um also<br>being and also being mindful of the fact<br>that there's distributional impacts are<br>from loose monetary policy as well so<br>Adrian earlier this morning talked about<br>that new dimension that well-being<br>Dimension and certainly when we've seen<br>over the period when interest rates were<br>very uh monetary policy was very loose<br>for a long time we saw that most of that<br>um impact was for people uh really who<br>had the equity to make use of those low<br>borrowing costs for those that didn't<br>have that Equity um having the asset<br>prices keep increasing away and um<br>always<br>um that I struggle to catch up with that<br>rise and uh interest uh house prices in<br>order to be able to get into the housing<br>market certainly you can really see the<br>distributional impact that monetary<br>policy can have on across the economy so<br>those would be the key things I would um<br>take in terms of what we've seen even uh<br>both prior to the pandemic and then also<br>and more recently as we now adjust to a<br>new normal<br>thank you for the opportunity to share<br>this panel with my StreetWise colleagues<br>it's great to be here<br>um<br>I'll cut to the chase<br>score five out of 10.<br>it's not a school for effort<br>it's a score for<br>outcomes and it recognizes that there's<br>a lot of factors in play which influence<br>the outcomes Shocks come along which<br>make it a challenging job I'm not too<br>sure many of us would like to take up<br>the Governor's role<br>and also there's all the challenges<br>imposed by Her Majesty's government on<br>the fiscal side which make it all the<br>um<br>it's a pass mark<br>but it's a bit like the Chiefs drawing<br>with the hurricanes<br>not very satisfying<br>and it's not even against it's not even<br>a draw with the Crusaders<br>um<br>but we have this evaluation and the<br>question is you know are we thinking<br>about for the five years or are we<br>thinking about their performance at<br>particularly important times we're<br>decisive decisions<br>were made or are we thinking about<br>um<br>the state of the bank now you know we've<br>come through<br>where are we at are we ready for the<br>future<br>um<br>and the question is should it be the<br>Reserve Bank reporting on itself anyway<br>or should it be other people undertaking<br>a review of the bank and perhaps the<br>bank might be able to do quite a good<br>job of reviewing the fiscal policies<br>that they had to work with<br>so anyway I I would like to put on the<br>table three reasons for my<br>my passing grade which gives room for<br>improvement<br>first of all to me there's been a severe<br>loss of confidence in the bank amongst<br>the academic community in which I live<br>in amongst the borrowing community in<br>which I live<br>you know I may have a bad memory but<br>my memory is my colleagues and peers and<br>business associates had greater<br>confidence in the institution than they<br>do today<br>was that well I think many perceived the<br>bank as being like a learner driver over<br>the last few years<br>over correcting<br>um perhaps even destabilizing the<br>economy rather than helping us<br>move to Greater balance<br>um<br>a reluctance of the bank to<br>uh<br>publicly acknowledged when it got things<br>wrong<br>and so<br>um<br>in in choosing very<br>major analogies to say we avoided<br>Armageddon well<br>we didn't avoid a lot of Lissa<br>so that's that's the first concern is is<br>the perceptions there's the rebuilding<br>challenge there the second I I say<br>has there been sufficient preparation<br>for the future we had the conversation<br>about digital currencies this morning<br>really helpful but I think there's been<br>a lot happening around the world I don't<br>think we're as far forward as we should<br>be and ready for Central Bank<br>initiatives and for Central Bank<br>oversight the future is coming fast<br>and secondly I think I think as part of<br>that<br>future building I don't think we've got<br>our human capital right our our<br>academic capability and I'm I was really<br>excited to hear uh Paul's comments about<br>the potential for greater engagement by<br>the bank with the the thinking community<br>and<br>a uh<br>suggest to you that over the last five<br>years the banks breadth of interests has<br>increased but its depth of capability<br>has uh diminished and and so we we<br>haven't got the the mix optimal there<br>and thirdly I want to jump outside of<br>the monetary policy remit for a while<br>and then talk about fiduciary oversight<br>and Prudential regulation<br>um there's been a lot done in the last<br>uh few years but I suggest to you that<br>um<br>there's been a trend towards complexity<br>a lot of stuff happening and<br>um in that some of the most important<br>stuff hasn't been<br>occurring and I think it hasn't been<br>helped by the whole basal process I I I<br>think you know you<br>you get Auditors and technocrats into<br>certain kind of stuff they they get<br>locked into the detail and they<br>sometimes miss the most important stuff<br>which is essential for ensuring our<br>financial security so<br>Let's uh look forward to a higher score<br>next time around thank you<br>thanks uh Frank and I noticed that Paul<br>looked like he like he might like to ask<br>for a grade reconsideration from uh from<br>the current head of our school of<br>accounting but I did notice him nodding<br>his head in appreciation of some of the<br>comments that that were made<br>um I guess you know when while I was<br>listening to these panelists and the<br>insights that they were bringing it just<br>kept on reminding me that economics one<br>of our strengths and weaknesses of a<br>discipline is that we use models we make<br>assumptions and that's we're not just a<br>pure descriptive science but the way<br>that you can look forward is to is to<br>try to distill what's interesting and<br>what's important about a situation about<br>a problem and use that as a lens to try<br>to take us forward but of course our<br>panelists reminded us of a lot of the<br>problems with this we've got multiple<br>targets<br>and they threw in fiscal policy as well<br>as multiple monetary policy targets that<br>may be sometimes conflicting so we've<br>got multiple targets we've got other<br>things in the economy to to worry about<br>as well including what the fiscal policy<br>guys are doing Christina reminded us<br>about those lags and of course these are<br>the the bane of many macro economists um<br>lives that you know you might change<br>something in macro policy but you've got<br>12 18 months time period before it<br>really kicks in so I guess the first<br>question I'd like to start with and if<br>you've got questions from the floor<br>please do raise your hand so we get the<br>mic to you while while they're thinking<br>about this one but the first question<br>I'd like to address the panelists is on<br>this issue of multiple targets in a very<br>Dynamic difficult environment<br>um<br>it's all very well to do ex post<br>assessment and we understand the<br>difficulty of forecasting and also it<br>reminded me of that old joke that you<br>know the economists are there to make<br>the weather forecasters look good<br>um but I'd like you your insights into<br>these<br>conflicting sometimes policy targets<br>have we got too many targets<br>um have we got the right targets how do<br>we manage these multiple targets Paul do<br>you want to start with that one<br>weather forecasters have much better<br>data than economists what I would give<br>for continuous real-time data on where<br>the economy is at it would be incredibly<br>useful and as I said in my comments you<br>know I think we can go some way towards<br>that and that's part of our agenda going<br>forward in terms of multiple targets I<br>think you know the governor addressed<br>this issue uh this morning<br>personally I am indifferent about<br>whether we have maximum sustainable<br>employment in our remit it's actually in<br>the legislation so to get rid of it<br>would involve reopening the the ACT<br>um you know which is the government can<br>obviously do that and the reason I'm<br>indifferent about it is that um you know<br>often like more often than not our<br>inflation inflation and what's happening<br>in the labor market are correlated so<br>it's reasonably rare for us to have a<br>conflict there of course you know with<br>Supply shocks<br>um it's absolutely possible that we have<br>a conflict there and I think we need a<br>clear sort of guidance on what we<br>prioritize in that uh situation and<br>we're actually doing a remit review at<br>the moment we'll be giving advice to the<br>Minister of Finance uh in April that<br>does address<br>um some of these things and the last<br>thing I'll say is you know as Adrian<br>said this stuff is it's hard<br>um getting across<br>um you know just even in the monetary<br>policy space and then you go more<br>broadly across the bank and financial<br>stability uh and inclusion the other<br>sort of objectives we've been given and<br>then you sort of go broader again across<br>the public sector the regulatory system<br>what's happening uh in the fiscal space<br>but I think the challenges that we're<br>facing at the moment require all those<br>policy areas to be uh lined up I'm sort<br>of you know I'm aware you know what<br>Graham Dr Graham Scott said yesterday<br>about you know sometimes it's just good<br>to give someone a job and go away and do<br>that and you know I think that's true<br>but I think there's in some cases but I<br>think a lot of the issues we're facing<br>into require a whole of government<br>approach<br>Cameron did you want to make any<br>comments on this issue of targets<br>well<br>presumably<br>yeah if we do get that Clash<br>then we are going to get that clash<br>between the employment<br>and the inflation objective<br>the inflation ejector becomes sacrosanct<br>which that's the one that you go after<br>and I guess the bigger issue to me is<br>once again how does that Clash play out<br>because I think it's coming<br>yeah the reality is that<br>central banks inflation fighting for the<br>past 30 years has had a whole lot of<br>Dynamics and central banks favor whether<br>you look at globalization demographics<br>technology that there's a big list<br>and if you look at what they're facing<br>nowadays whether it be the world that is<br>onshoring<br>there's systems that are becoming just<br>in case as opposed to just in time big<br>shift in labor market rebalancing back<br>towards the employees versus employers<br>our demographics people are starting to<br>spend as opposed to saves that's eating<br>into the savings clock<br>yeah the way central banks or the pain<br>that central banks need to dish out now<br>to get the inflationary Thief back in<br>jail is going to be higher<br>and that's where I'm looking at how does<br>this pan out within a social sense<br>and I don't have answers to that at the<br>moment but it's one of my big concerns<br>thanks Cameron<br>my um concern is this morning I thought<br>the governor did a good job of<br>explaining the complexity that they face<br>but the very real risk is is that in<br>thinking about this complexity we create<br>confusion and it seems to me weird I<br>hear talk about multiple objective<br>functions I start to get really worried<br>you know what is the objective function<br>and what are the arguments in that<br>objective function and and how do we<br>bring these uh different issues together<br>in an appropriate manner giving<br>the right weight to this issue in a<br>different way to this other issue in a<br>different place so so I think<br>if we can reduce the confusion we<br>enhance the trust and we bring the best<br>out of our advisors and and others<br>yeah so all policy as we discussed<br>earlier this morning all policy<br>interventions will have trade-offs so<br>it's a matter of whether we make those<br>are they implicit or we make them<br>explicit<br>um I agree that in terms of priority uh<br>inflation from a credibility perspective<br>uh should be the priority into we making<br>policy<br>um and then it's all um it's then more<br>about taking into consideration what are<br>the side effects if you like from um<br>um you're just a respond to Frank like I<br>I take your caution uh that if we get to<br>sort of absorbed in this in this world<br>of multiple objectives with their own<br>set of trade-offs you know the danger is<br>that we end up with with mush kind of<br>thing so I think there is an argument<br>for saying we need to be very clear uh<br>on on certain things and I take camps<br>Point as well you know that inflation<br>should have uh Primacy when we get into<br>a situation of trade-offs we've got more<br>coming uh on that with our remit review<br>but I also say you know the world is<br>incredibly complex and in a sense this<br>challenge for policy makers just<br>reflects the world that we're operating<br>in and the world is getting more and<br>more complex so in a way we can't get<br>away from it<br>um but I do you know fully take the<br>point we need to understand these which<br>is now that that's our call like can we<br>work with academics like you know we've<br>got a lot of work to figure this stuff<br>out uh and you know we can go further<br>with it together<br>one of the interesting things in the<br>last<br>six to 12 months has been the<br>consistency and the messaging coming out<br>of the U.S federal reserve which is the<br>most powerful Central Bank around the<br>Globes so you need to listen yeah<br>they've been on script and it's been a<br>really consistent message and financial<br>markets didn't want to buy into that<br>script at the end of last year earlier<br>this year pushing the pivot interest<br>rates are coming back down while markets<br>in our airing back towards the fed's<br>view of the world we've got a tough job<br>ahead and rates might need to be higher<br>for longer so the message is starting to<br>get through but all fed members have<br>been singing from the same hitting book<br>it's been great to see<br>thanks can we get a mic to this table<br>thank you very much I I<br>was actually quite pleased to hear Frank<br>of the reserve Banker score of five out<br>of ten because that's about what I would<br>give them and I thought I was going to<br>be the extreme one here<br>um The Reserve Bank has admitted they<br>were a bit slow in moving away from<br>their low easing I think the biggest<br>problem was how far they went into that<br>low easing and they they don't seem to<br>take any responsibility for that uh Paul<br>has explained it that they avoided<br>economic Armageddon well you can't prove<br>that either way it's it's something that<br>is unprovable<br>um<br>Adrian Orr this morning said you've<br>always got to be conscious of the<br>trade-offs that your tools are limited<br>and there are long legs well I think you<br>forgot about all of those during that<br>period the trade-off was completely<br>forgotten you focused entirely on growth<br>and employment and forgot about<br>inflation you you ignored the trade-offs<br>you seem to forget the two tools are<br>limited you thought you could do<br>everything and all central banks did<br>that they lost their modesty and they<br>tried to take on everything<br>and the lags<br>I went down to the Reserve Bank in<br>November 2020 and said you're building<br>up asset price pressure you increase<br>risk in the financial sector and latent<br>inflation repressions they you couldn't<br>see all of them but they were going to<br>come because of your settings and you<br>forgot about the lags did you take any<br>of those things into account in 2020 and<br>early 2021 because it's not obvious to<br>um I I was an outsider at the time as<br>well<br>I've been on this job for about 10<br>months now which gives which gives me a<br>useful separation from actually what was<br>going on in the building uh at that time<br>I think it gives me perspective uh on<br>these challenges I think you know when I<br>get asked this question and I get asked<br>a lot I sort of say well uh cast your<br>minds back to where we were at uh at<br>that time and you know Joanna talked<br>about massive uncertainty uh during that<br>period uh the bank also took at least<br>regrets uh approach in terms of avoiding<br>uh deflation it was very focused uh on<br>doing that you know and I think with the<br>benefit of hindsight or another way of<br>putting that you know if we had if the<br>bank had perfect foresight uh at the<br>time then you know and that's exactly<br>what rafimp is about it's about looking<br>back to say well what could we have done<br>better so that we're better placed<br>um to to do it going forward you know<br>the housing market uh point is<br>interesting it sort of came up yesterday<br>as well around migration<br>um you know you need houses to house<br>migrants but you need migrants to build<br>houses you know I think if we're worried<br>about inflation and like yes house<br>prices are affected by interest rates<br>that's clear on the way up and the way<br>down we're seeing that currently but if<br>you if you want to avoid uh big swings<br>in house prices uh fix the housing<br>market build more houses it's not clear<br>to me that monetary policy should in<br>effect be constrained by sub-optimal<br>policy settings uh in in the housing<br>market<br>so yeah I I would argue that all of<br>those things you listed would have been<br>on the desk on around the table in<br>monetary policy committee meetings<br>um but you know I I totally respect the<br>view that you're putting forward yeah<br>thanks for that Paul thanks for linking<br>back to some of those other panels that<br>we've had and also reminding us we tend<br>to think about demand when we're<br>thinking about inflation but of course<br>it's it's the mismatch of supply and<br>demand and longer term I guess the hope<br>is if we can expand that supply and<br>economy we don't end up with an<br>inflation problem of course Paul you've<br>got a lot of experience in this area so<br>hopefully that will start to come<br>through in in The Reserve Bank<br>um we're focusing on<br>covert right but go back 10 15 years<br>we've really had a maxim it's whatever<br>it takes<br>yeah we're just going to flood the<br>system with liquidity we did it after<br>the GFC now a certain amount was<br>required because we were in the midst of<br>the the financial crisis but the the<br>playbook for what got unlocked over<br>covert has been in play for more than a<br>decade<br>okay we've got a very popular question<br>that's come through from slido um do you<br>think New Zealand could be well served<br>by 20 or 30-year fixed sorry fixed rate<br>mortgages similar to the US and Nordic<br>lending markets<br>I'm not sure which of you would care to<br>take first go at this one<br>given the the discussion about the lags<br>and monetary policy it would make it<br>even harder to conduct monetary policy I<br>would imagine given any changes to the<br>policy cash rate itself wouldn't really<br>translate through for a long time onto<br>the broader economy<br>um so I would say from a<br>effectiveness of monetary policy I would<br>it would probably make things a lot<br>harder thanks any other comments<br>like I'll just say that uh you know we<br>talk a lot about mortgages uh as a<br>channel for monetary policy transmission<br>uh to the real economy and you know it's<br>true it's a really important part of<br>that transmission mechanism but there<br>are there are other ones as well you<br>know we've talked about uh the influence<br>on asset prices uh and of course through<br>the exchange rate and the influence that<br>that has on exports and import import<br>prices and activity in that in that part<br>of the economy so you know my sort of<br>view on this yeah I think I think for<br>some mortgages the the sort of stability<br>of being able to lock in a mortgage for<br>that length of time would be uh<br>well-being enhancing I take Christina<br>Christina's point that that would even<br>sort of lengthen those lags for part of<br>the transmission system for for monetary<br>policy there are other sort of mechanism<br>or ways in which what we do with the OCR<br>transmits to the real side of the<br>economy<br>I'm not sure to be huge demand for the<br>product<br>now the reality is that most new<br>zealanders like the attractiveness of a<br>one and a two Euro<br>and Banks like to Max their assets with<br>their liabilities<br>yeah so that's where they tend to go<br>most aggressive in regard to pricing it<br>tends to be the better value for<br>customers<br>okay<br>um do wave out if you've got questions<br>from the floor and I'll watch out and<br>get the mic to you there's one at the<br>back please if we can get a mic<br>my name is Reza<br>um<br>I am a property developer I am a startup<br>owner in the tech space and I've had<br>countless<br>um nights of without the sleeps or the<br>past year because of the you know<br>turbulances in the market<br>I'm also a lecturer of finance and<br>economics<br>at Wayne Tech and so<br>um I I see a lot of cognitive biases<br>when it comes to when I look back at the<br>decision making you have this situation<br>where there is an influx of money<br>Supply money and you also have these<br>disruptions in<br>you know the supply chain which affects<br>production so the Reserve Bank<br>would know that there will be lower<br>production<br>and although it always takes this<br>passive position that things happen then<br>the Reserve Bank reacts and there's a<br>lag in the policy<br>um all of a sudden when it came to covet<br>it decided that it needs to be proactive<br>and cut the rates significantly at the<br>time<br>so what did we expect really in a<br>situation where you have lower<br>production a huge supply of money well<br>of course you would have inflation right<br>and it's not something that you can say<br>this is we can look at it in retrospect<br>or on the hind side in uh yes we could<br>do things differently as an economist or<br>you know many economists they would know<br>that that would happen right<br>so I don't really see that as an<br>acceptable thing coming from The Reserve<br>Bank<br>another thing is what is frightening me<br>at the moment<br>is that those cognitive biases like we<br>convince ourselves that the situation is<br>too complex to handle so it is okay to<br>make huge mistakes<br>and we I believe we panicked at the<br>outset we sort of The Reserve Bank<br>reduced the interest rates did the lsap<br>program on the other side the government<br>kept the spending and spending<br>and uh<br>what is is<br>frightening now is that<br>um we we have set a one to three percent<br>inflation Target and we're hoping to<br>achieve that by the mid uh by mid 2024 I<br>don't see that being a realistic Target<br>and I see that it is just they'll be<br>convincing ourselves again that that's<br>going to happen<br>and we know that the government is going<br>to keep spending right they will spend<br>and spend the and I think at the moment<br>the real interest rates are lower than<br>inflation as they're still fueling the<br>inflation really and at the end of the<br>day I I don't see a clear path forward<br>uh with with this mindset that doesn't<br>take it seriously enough and doesn't<br>take action in time let's let's open<br>this up to the panel we're very time<br>constrained here so if you want to make<br>any brief comments in response thanks<br>for that question yeah there's a a lot<br>in that<br>like you know we of course we take it<br>seriously like I totally push back uh on<br>on that we're a very dedicated motivator<br>but I don't need to tell you uh all of<br>that you know in the covert thing you<br>know like my recollection of what<br>commentators around the place were<br>saying most of the conversation was<br>about how do we get uh interest rates uh<br>negative sort of reflecting the severity<br>of the situation that we were in at the<br>time uh and yes with the benefit of<br>hindsight you know you can uh make you<br>can make those points but um<br>I think it's you know it's really<br>important to think about what was on the<br>table uh at the time with fatality rates<br>growing exponentially uh around the<br>world it was a very dramatic time also<br>you know the stuff on fiscal policy like<br>that was a really big fiscal response<br>the wage subsidy worked incredibly well<br>uh the fiscal authorities were very good<br>at getting that out the door and into<br>people's bank accounts uh you know<br>pretty much instantaneously and and and<br>it worked<br>um so yeah I I don't really know how to<br>address your other comments apart to say<br>you know we need to as I said we need to<br>learn more about how these tools uh<br>interact uh with each other we have got<br>a coffee break coming up so maybe you<br>can explore some of those during the<br>coffee break to be fair to the reserve<br>end there's been a lot going on like<br>Ukraine<br>yeah consistent problems across you know<br>China's supply chain with their extended<br>lockdown that sort of stuff so this<br>morphed Way Beyond<br>covert which made their problems more<br>diff the challenges more difficult that<br>said you know<br>The Omelette was overeat<br>and you know I come back to what I said<br>earlier on about the funding for lending<br>program I still struggle to get my head<br>around<br>in regard to why a crisis management<br>tool was ever put in place with the<br>banking system that was very well<br>financed and had no problems accessing<br>cash<br>and the enthusiasm for negative interest<br>rates I don't think was coming from the<br>private sector<br>and that was coming from within the<br>Reserve Bank and The Reserve Bank<br>clicked that for touch sorry The Reserve<br>Bank of Australia to see we're not going<br>there<br>we're almost out of time but Christine<br>and Frank if you would like to make any<br>final remarks so I think it within the<br>crisis or a demanding period large<br>proportions of the population in the<br>business Community want to get behind<br>our leaders they want stability they<br>want to know what's going on<br>but the challenge within that is that<br>sometimes it can create a certain kind<br>of group think and we we don't get the<br>alternative view or the alternative view<br>is not specified very clearly<br>um and and so I think part of the<br>challenge is to build into our<br>institutional design and our processes<br>how we hear those discordant voices even<br>when they are not quite right they're<br>usually on to a genuine irritant or a<br>genuine kind of matter and the<br>challenges for us to find mechanisms to<br>hear that but hear it appropriately<br>rather than just become reactionary<br>over the history tree of the survey<br>during times of high uncertainty is when<br>we see our business confidence at very<br>low levels so that just goes to show how<br>important it is to have some clarity<br>some sort of plan so that businesses and<br>households can plan around that I even<br>if it's knowing that the Outlook is<br>going to be Grim it's not so much about<br>what's going to happen over the coming<br>years it's like being able to plan<br>around the events as much as possible so<br>that's where having that transparency<br>that was talked about earlier this<br>morning is quite important so that<br>people know what they're in for and can<br>plan around those accordingly and I'm<br>sorry I know that Paul has more he wants<br>to add in here but I'm sorry I am going<br>to have to close this session I think we<br>we are moving to a break next but you<br>know this has been a great session it's<br>lots of linkages with other sessions<br>including you know Graham Scott I<br>suggested whether you know the Reserve<br>Bank board is the right sort of mix and<br>there's a question come through here<br>that we didn't have time to ask but it's<br>an interesting question is it possible<br>that that composition of the board with<br>limited expertise in this area is making<br>us prone to swings in um in swings in in<br>decisions that can be destabilizing so<br>there's lots and lots of room for<br>discussion I hope the discussion will be<br>ongoing during the break I'm going to<br>look to Matt now to advise us what time<br>we need to finish the coffee break<br>10 50 please we've got great sessions<br>coming up out of the break so please go<br>and enjoy some coffee and be back at 10<br>50. thank you very much oh sorry thank<br>sorry for that<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
