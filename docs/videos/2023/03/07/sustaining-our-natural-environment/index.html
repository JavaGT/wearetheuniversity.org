critical<br>discussion given the overall theme of<br>our Workshop arguably the greatest<br>challenge facing us<br>and one that affects everything else and<br>of course it's been even more in the<br>spotlight<br>given the extreme weather in recent<br>weeks so our panel on sustaining the<br>natural environment how do we navigate<br>and adapt on the path to Net Zero<br>that's going to be our Focus we've got a<br>wonderful set of speakers our first<br>speaker is going to be the honorable<br>Julianne genter joining us online from<br>Zoom thanks very much Julianne A Member<br>of Parliament for the Green Party<br>our second speaker will be Malcolm Johns<br>Malcolm is the CEO of Genesis energy<br>former CEO of Christchurch Airport and a<br>member of the climate leaders coalition<br>we've got Amanda Whiting very much in<br>the spotlight at the moment her position<br>CEO at iag New Zealand really important<br>insights I'm sure we'll get from Amanda<br>and our final speaker in this session<br>will be bringing us a wealth of<br>knowledge and experience tanira kingi<br>he's the principal consultant at kokori<br>research and Emeritus Professor sorry<br>Emeritus research scientist at Siam<br>with that we'll pass to you Julianne and<br>uh we'll have five minutes of intro up<br>to five minutes of of info remarks to<br>leave plenty of time for discussion<br>name Hotel<br>um<br>I'm gonna start just going a bit big<br>picture<br>um which is that we need nature and a<br>healthy ecosystems in order for us to<br>thrive and we absolutely can live in<br>harmony with nature but for many decades<br>it's been passed as a trade-off as if<br>protecting restoring and sustaining<br>natural ecosystems is a cost and that at<br>times we can't afford it<br>um as was referenced all of you know<br>in the last few weeks out Hero has been<br>hit really hard with severe weather<br>events and flooding and that's had<br>enormous impact on people's lives some<br>have lost homes some have lost their<br>livelihoods and even some lives have<br>been lost which is absolutely tragic<br>one thing that I've really noticed is<br>that in times of Crisis we also see the<br>very best of people we have seen<br>communities come together we've seen<br>people bravely face danger to help their<br>neighbors they've shared Kai and<br>we do this out of love and compassion<br>our human civilization has largely<br>progressed because of cooperation and I<br>think we all know that it feels good to<br>help other people we raise our children<br>out of love we look after our sick<br>relatives we make meals for friends we<br>volunteer<br>but our current economic system ignores<br>some of the most important Mahi that we<br>do<br>it only values commercial transactions<br>so it pretends the only things that<br>matter are those times when money is<br>changing hands<br>and it really cannot differentiate when<br>money is earned as the result of a<br>genuine contribution which many times<br>there is or whether it wealth is being<br>amassed through some exploitation<br>whether that be of people or of Natural<br>Resources<br>so just as an example globally we have<br>this outrageous situation where the<br>biggest oil companies the industry is<br>most responsible for some of our<br>ecological crises and the climate chaos<br>we're already starting to experience<br>made record profits last year in 2022.<br>we have a handful of people who are<br>supposedly worth thousands of times more<br>than our essential workers who actually<br>keep our economy going you know the<br>people who collect our rubbish midwives<br>nurses Early Childhood teachers and also<br>the people who stay home to raise<br>children and look after relatives and<br>community members<br>so I think in order to sustain our<br>natural environment we need to really<br>execute a big shift in how we approach<br>the economy<br>the reality is that everyone needs a<br>decent secure place to call home<br>nourishing Kai Health Care education and<br>when people have those needs met they're<br>able to bring their best selves and<br>we're going to need everyone because<br>humans are going to need to cooperate<br>like never before in order for us to<br>combat this climate crisis and adapt to<br>the warming that's already locked in<br>so that's the big picture<br>everyone can have a livable income and<br>live with dignity if we change some of<br>our tax settings to tax wealth and<br>excess profit of some of those<br>corporations that have been doing too<br>well<br>there's two other big important ideas<br>which I'll briefly touch upon so my<br>background before I got into politics<br>was Urban Regional planning and<br>transport planning there's a huge<br>opportunity to design our infrastructure<br>and our human settlements in a way that<br>works with nature rather than against it<br>and it's kind of a win-win but it does<br>mean doing things differently and so I<br>guess changing those institutions that<br>are usually responsible for delivering<br>that infrastructure helping people get<br>on board with new ways of doing things<br>and evolving more responsibility to<br>communities is how I think we're going<br>to facilitate that<br>and finally<br>um half Earth I don't know if there's a<br>wonderful book called half Earth and it<br>really stresses the importance of wild<br>places and humans part of how we respond<br>to climate change I think has to be just<br>allowing more land and more of our<br>oceans to be completely Untouched by<br>humans for a while so that life can<br>bounce back well actually probably in<br>perpetuity but um I think the current<br>focus on Net Zero maybe is a little<br>overly focused on accounting and we need<br>to just recognize we're not going to be<br>able to account for all the all the<br>things we just need to focus on more<br>land more of our oceans being protected<br>and conserved<br>thank you very much for those remarks<br>Julianne um with that we'll move on to<br>Malcolm please<br>uh<br>what I thought I'd do is just talk a<br>little bit about my practical<br>experiences in this area over the last<br>three or four years uh and in 2018 the<br>Prime Minister asked me if I would be<br>one of New Zealand's delegates to the AP<br>Business Council which I agreed to which<br>is made up of the 21 economies of the<br>Asia Pacific region and I was asked to<br>lead the climate change working group<br>and when I joined the council president<br>Trump was in office in the U.S and that<br>meant that we weren't allowed to use the<br>words climate change in our working<br>group and if we did the U.S delegation<br>had to leave the conversation thankfully<br>that changed to President Biden and the<br>U.S has moved into much more of an<br>aggressive stance in terms of that<br>there's a couple of learnings that I<br>took out of the the journey that I had<br>with that group of people first of all<br>before the Ukraine Invasion Russia was<br>part of the conversation and I had the<br>privilege of being lectured at length on<br>how green the Russian and petrochemical<br>industry was and how much it can<br>contribute to decarbonizing the world<br>but I also had the opportunity to hear<br>from 19 other economies in the region in<br>terms of how they viewed not only<br>climate change but New Zealand and it's<br>very interesting that there is no one<br>single view of what climate change means<br>some economies look at it through the<br>lens of potable water others through<br>Waste Management others through pure<br>Economic Opportunity but if I take New<br>Zealand's philosophy on climate change<br>we have about four other economies out<br>of 21 that line up with our personal or<br>our national view of climate change<br>the second thing that I learned is the<br>importance of sweeping your own backyard<br>first so during my time in the council<br>the things that I was tackled on was why<br>does New Zealand protect its<br>agricultural sector<br>why does New Zealand provide tax breaks<br>on fossil fuels and that was only two<br>weeks ago that I was tackled on there<br>uh you know things like why does New<br>Zealand protect its National Airline one<br>of the most protected airlines in the<br>world and those were things that really<br>surprised me because coming from New<br>Zealand out to the rest of the world<br>they were in perspectives that I held<br>but they are views from the outside<br>looking in now there are two things that<br>I think are really critical uh for this<br>forum to get its head around in terms of<br>sustainability and climate change the<br>first is there are irrefutable facts we<br>have one atmosphere it does not have a<br>variable denominator so if we're using<br>climate change models that have variable<br>denominators in our businesses in our<br>economies Etc then we're not actually<br>transitioning we're just extending the<br>status quo<br>the second non-negotiable is that for<br>any economy in the world whether they<br>are autocratic Democratic or any other<br>form is that energy security and food<br>security are non-negotiables when it<br>comes to dealing with climate change<br>for New Zealand there is a threat on the<br>horizon and that is that as geopolitics<br>comes to dominate trade policy<br>climate change could be weaponized for<br>trade protection and for geopolitical<br>convenience and that would be terrible<br>from dealing with climate change<br>perspective<br>the second is we have to sweep our own<br>backyard first so it's not for us to go<br>into the world in a highly moralistic<br>way and begin to tackle what is a global<br>a global issue we have to make sure that<br>we have our own house in order first<br>and what's happened in the last two<br>years is public sentiment has moved from<br>a focus on mitigation to an absolute<br>requirement on adaptation<br>and one of the challenges we have in<br>terms of critical infrastructure has<br>come to the fore over the last month or<br>so and that is that many of much of the<br>infrastructure that is critical to food<br>security to energy security to transport<br>Logistics Etc in New Zealand is built on<br>the ambition of a previous generation<br>it's not built on the ambition of a<br>current generation<br>and our ability to move that to a much<br>more resilient state is hampered<br>primarily by the consenting processes<br>that have to be followed in New Zealand<br>under the resource management act we<br>treat critical infrastructure under that<br>act the same way we treat building a<br>Burger King on a corner uh and we have<br>to ask ourselves really do we want up to<br>40 cents in every dollar invested over<br>the next 20 years going into a process<br>to get a consent to either add new<br>critical infrastructure to deal with<br>energy transition in New Zealand or to<br>move existing critical infrastructure to<br>new locations so that we can become more<br>resilient in events like Cyclone<br>Gabrielle so the two things that are<br>critical to New Zealand sweep our own<br>backyard first and understand the<br>non-negotiables of climate change from a<br>social perspective and make it easier<br>for businesses in New Zealand to invest<br>money in adaptation rather than in the<br>process for permission to begin this the<br>process of adaptation thank you<br>you're almost stole some of my thunder<br>there because you know we're in we're<br>right in a moment now<br>where we have a massive opportunity to<br>start thinking differently about how we<br>adapt<br>we've just experienced two major Peril<br>events in a space of two weeks and I'm I<br>I believe that's going to be the new<br>normal<br>so last year we saw our perilous events<br>double<br>almost double<br>um and I think that's going to be the<br>way the the way that we live here in New<br>Zealand<br>so<br>um just to give you a few statistics<br>around where we're at<br>there's been 78 000 claims lodged for<br>the last two events that's bigger than<br>kaikoura<br>um we've had an event in Auckland that<br>I've been in Insurance a long time and<br>I've I've never seen an event where<br>there is flash flooding in a city<br>it's pretty incredible<br>Cyclone Gabrielle has spread across the<br>whole North Island so we're no longer<br>talking about how we support a community<br>it supports support supporting multiple<br>communities<br>and I was in Hawke's Bay a couple of<br>days ago and talking to my team in the<br>afternoon and they said just give us<br>some words to describe what you've seen<br>and I said I actually can't because<br>there isn't a word big enough for me to<br>describe what has happened here in this<br>community<br>and I'm raising all of those things<br>because I think we have to step into the<br>and we definitely need to be thinking<br>about how reducing carbon emissions but<br>we also need to be focusing in on<br>adaptation<br>and as I said we've got a great<br>opportunity here where there are many<br>people that have been impacted their<br>homes their livelihoods we need to lean<br>into this and think very differently<br>about how we rebuild or build better<br>so with with that in mind<br>um you know we've got a national<br>adaptation plan I genuinely believe that<br>we can start very simply it's always<br>difficult when you look at these things<br>in big picture but my view is that we<br>can start really simply by just<br>identifying where these high risk areas<br>are and we've got the mapping government<br>have got the mapping other stakeholders<br>have got the mapping pull that all<br>together<br>and then move to stopping development in<br>those areas unless it is in a way that<br>actually mitigates any of the risk<br>and then lastly we start to invest<br>regularly in the communities that we<br>know have significant exposure and that<br>we can help them adapt<br>um<br>uh<br>Jason<br>good morning everyone I'm going to pick<br>up on the point raised earlier about the<br>protection of the of the Agricultural<br>sector<br>and my interests here is in the primary<br>sector's ability to be able to reach<br>The Net Zero targets of 2050 but also<br>the agricultural sector's ability to to<br>meet the<br>2030 domestic Target<br>of<br>reductions of 10 by 2030.<br>and in recent years we've had a number<br>of Christ from the sector to say that<br>uh the sector has never been under so<br>much pressure from from regulation but<br>at the other end of the spectrum we've<br>got uh commentators and uh and others<br>who are saying that it's long overdue<br>and the agricultural sector should have<br>gone into the ets a long a long time ago<br>but I want to look at that uh that the<br>positioning between regulation<br>and and Market demands Market<br>requirements<br>because right now we have a number of<br>our biggest buyers of our of our<br>products uh<br>such as Nestle dunon Mars<br>old lamb some of the biggest ingredient<br>in product buyers in the world<br>who are very very ambitious targets much<br>more ambitious targets than we have in<br>our domestic<br>domestic targets under the ccra<br>of reducing emissions by 50 by 2030.<br>and then going through to<br>um to Net Zero by 2050. donone has just<br>come out in 2023<br>ends and said that they want to see the<br>supply chain<br>of all of the milk that they produce<br>reducing by 30 percent<br>by 2030.<br>so we've got a we've got a target of 10<br>and there is resistance there what I<br>want to understand and this is a<br>question that I'll leave for the floor<br>is why do we have some of our biggest<br>processes and marketers in this country<br>that aren't setting gross emissions<br>reductions but carbon neutral<br>the second point I I want to make is<br>around the inertia<br>that's uh that has some parts of the<br>Agricultural sector has<br>uh in in opposing uh change and if we<br>look back at the history of of the<br>Agricultural sector and some would say<br>it started in 1814 when Samuel Marsden<br>brought over a number of uh of beef beef<br>and dairy kettles which which were the<br>start of the of the um the agricultural<br>industry in the country and if we look<br>at the timeline<br>from then through to 1871 when the first<br>when the first Cooperative was was<br>produced through to 1923 when the dairy<br>border was established a few years later<br>New Zealand's agricultural University<br>was set up now NASA University in 1926<br>and in 1927 we had Dairy Research<br>Institute that's all happened in the<br>last 100 years<br>so my question is you know have we got<br>the right institutions to drive the<br>change that's needed we've got Levy and<br>this is not a criticism against our<br>levy-funded organizations<br>but when their very existence relies on<br>on collecting levies from Farmers<br>that want the status quo to continue<br>we've got it we've got the question<br>whether we've got the right institutions<br>to drive the restructuring that's needed<br>my my final point<br>is around Maori agribusiness and Maori<br>agriculture<br>I'm picking on some of the points that<br>paracophia in in Jason uh talked about<br>uh around around the response of the<br>Maori sector to to both the the ccra<br>targets and also also all of the other<br>regulation that's going on around fresh<br>water and there are a couple of things<br>that we need to understand there firstly<br>that the the elected representatives of<br>these organizations are there is<br>are appointed by their family and hapu<br>representatives to make sure that that<br>land the water and the people are are<br>protected so their identity doesn't<br>doesn't depend on them being a Dairy<br>Farmer a sheep sheep and beef farmer or<br>a Forester it's about doing the right<br>thing so I might just leave it at that<br>thank you thank you very much wow what a<br>rich set of intro<br>remarks are coming from such a wide<br>range of experience and expertise it's<br>kind of difficult to know exactly where<br>to start but I will open it up to if<br>people would like to take the microphone<br>please wave out and we'll get a<br>microphone over to you<br>um otherwise I think partly because of<br>the nature of our panelists we're going<br>to end up with some rather specific<br>questions to the individual panelists so<br>I will tend to direct some of these<br>questions to particular panelists but of<br>course if somebody else has something<br>burning that they would like to jump in<br>but don't worry there's questions for<br>all of you I'm seeing coming through<br>here<br>um<br>okay do wave out on the floor if you've<br>got anything Julianne if you don't mind<br>I'll start with um you we've got a<br>question come through on slido<br>on electric car subsidies<br>uh it would be interesting to hear from<br>you<br>um how can the government handle the<br>inevitable inequity issues that would<br>accompany or that do accompany car<br>subsidies<br>that's really interesting so I when I<br>was associate minister of Transport last<br>term I worked on the clean car discount<br>and clean car standard and I assume that<br>the person asking the question is asking<br>about the clean car discount yes I think<br>so let's make it really clear it's not a<br>subsidy for cars it's a price incentive<br>within the market of cars coming to New<br>Zealand and that's a really important<br>distinction if we were to fund the<br>discount from the general Consolidated<br>fund from Education Health or money that<br>would other will otherwise be used for<br>other purposes it would I think be a<br>subsidy and I was really<br>very<br>determined not to do that that wouldn't<br>have made sense but New Zealand was<br>really far behind<br>um other oecd countries we had no fuel<br>economy standards we had no price<br>incentive for cleaner cars most of the<br>people who are buying new to New Zealand<br>cars<br>are actually corporations or you know<br>car rental companies businesses<br>and um and then there's a really small<br>percentage of New Zealand households<br>that buy new to New Zealand cars<br>and the most polluting cars like the<br>highest emissions ones were actually new<br>cars not secondhand<br>so um but most new zealanders Buy<br>second-hand vehicles within New Zealand<br>so the purpose of the clean car discount<br>was to provide both<br>the financial incentive for the<br>suppliers to bring in lower emissions<br>Vehicles including zero emissions<br>vehicles and then the standard kicks in<br>as well so those two policies work in<br>tandem to change the vehicles that are<br>being brought into the fleet and then<br>the more clean vehicles that we're<br>importing the more that will filter<br>through to the second hand market so<br>there's just there was no way to<br>influence the cars coming to New Zealand<br>without some without a standard and<br>without some sort of price incentive and<br>we can see there's been a really strong<br>response to that policy much faster<br>response than what was anticipated so<br>far more zero emissions and low<br>emissions vehicles coming in now than we<br>expected<br>uh so I think it's been successful from<br>that point of view and<br>um I mean ideally the fee part on the<br>more polluting Vehicles which are not<br>vehicles that are purchased by<br>low-income households they are Range<br>Rovers they are Land Cruisers and double<br>cab Utes that are being purchased either<br>by businesses or often individuals for<br>lifestyle purposes like um Towing boats<br>and Jet Skis and things like that so we<br>could show that the vast majority of the<br>feeds were going to be paid by<br>businesses and high income people but<br>there was an alternative which is they<br>could buy lower emitting vehicles and<br>indeed there were like double cab Utes<br>on the market in other countries that<br>had were lower emissions but because we<br>had no incentive until we put those<br>policies in place they weren't being<br>sold in New Zealand so<br>um I think the way to address inequity<br>in transport is to address inequity in<br>incomes and that's why I talked at the<br>beginning about Income Support<br>guaranteed minimum income when you have<br>less inequality than price signals<br>aren't such a big deal but if we don't<br>use price signals we tend to be actually<br>the majority of that benefit goes to the<br>highest income people for example the<br>cut to fuel excise and reducer charges<br>um the benefit to the richest households<br>is four or five times greater than to<br>the poorest households because the<br>richest households are more likely to<br>drive cars they drive further they buy<br>newer cars so I think<br>um yeah we have to address inequality in<br>society and we have to address emissions<br>in an effective way but we can't do that<br>by subsidizing<br>uh fuel use and and cars for the rich<br>people<br>or businesses thanks very much Julianne<br>and I guess we've also got these<br>interesting emerging issues of the<br>number of cars that have been written<br>off in in or will be written off um that<br>that's going to bring a whole well<br>perhaps Amanda might tell us it brings<br>some remarkable opportunities as well<br>but there's certainly some challenges<br>including in terms of equity<br>um for many people who's whose cars are<br>written off particularly those who are<br>not in short I might add I'll come back<br>to you in a moment Amanda but if I could<br>if I could address a question to you<br>tanira please<br>um we've got a question on what does Net<br>Zero mean for farmers and how do they<br>position themselves to be part of a net<br>zero value chain<br>is there a Maori sector perspective on<br>Net Zero some easy questions for you<br>all right so Net Zero is is better<br>understood if you see it if you see it<br>in in the full value chain or the supply<br>chain context<br>and so for net net zero at the farm<br>lever from the production level<br>um be able being able to get down to Net<br>Zero is difficult because of the<br>production system and that's why the the<br>agricultural sector has has split uh<br>carbon uh targets with methane 10<br>reduction by 2030 and then there's 36<br>average or 24 to 40 percent for our<br>2050. now the the the intention of Net<br>Zero is for is for those those Farmers<br>to be able to reduce the production<br>system through technology through Farm<br>systems and improvements and that'll get<br>you so far<br>beyond that there then relies on on land<br>use change or land use diversification<br>and it's not just from grass into exotic<br>Pines<br>it includes a raft of things so that's<br>Net Zero the other term that I used was<br>was carbon neutral<br>um oh sorry just going back to Net Zero<br>the idea about Net Zero is that you get<br>your system down you get the gross<br>emissions down as far as you as you can<br>without breaking the system and that<br>includes systems change as well as as<br>land use change and then and then<br>offsetting does play a part in it carbon<br>neutral is where offsetting is used to<br>maintain the status quo to maintain<br>productive output<br>but then to offset either using credits<br>or or sequestration<br>the Maori perspective on this and there<br>isn't a single Maori perspective I<br>should say but I work with I work with<br>dozens of of uh Maori land authorities<br>uh around the country<br>who are still grappling with<br>understanding the full implications of<br>of the of the regulations<br>um but in general<br>uh in the general statement many of them<br>are committed to doing the right thing<br>because they will be judged their<br>performance now will be judged by the<br>future generations and they want to be<br>on the right side of History being able<br>to drive and push change that will do<br>the right thing for their communities<br>for the land and the water and we can't<br>look at uh carbon regulations and and<br>carbon requirements reductions<br>requirements and isolation of of fresh<br>water because you may be able to have<br>changes in your farm system that reduce<br>greenhouse gas emissions but you're<br>still<br>sending far too many contaminants into<br>into water bodies or inside your<br>catchment<br>thanks very much wow that was I I<br>thought it was a tough question but as<br>you say there are multiple perspectives<br>just a little follow-up question on the<br>agriculture one to what extent should we<br>be focusing on this carbon neutrality or<br>or net emissions to what extent should<br>we be focusing just on New Zealand as<br>opposed to Global<br>emissions yeah so we've uh having having<br>signed up to the Paris agreement and and<br>also cop 27's commitments as well we do<br>need to play our part and this is one of<br>the reasons that I I talked about our<br>agricultural producers inside the<br>context of our International markets<br>they are going to be they're going to<br>have more influence on shaping New<br>Zealand's agricultural sector than<br>regulation<br>you know Farmers need to get the hit<br>around that when to known negotiates<br>with<br>fonterra<br>that their expectations are for gross<br>emissions not not carbon neutral status<br>but gross emissions to reduce beyond the<br>ten percent I'm not going to say this so<br>don't quote me that if that conversation<br>does happen it means that that the<br>signals need to go back very clearly to<br>the to the to the farmers and they need<br>to be supported to make those changes<br>the dairy sector there I'm not going to<br>say that they're in a in an inviable<br>position but for many of them they're on<br>they're on good land and they're also<br>inside<br>regions with with infrastructure for<br>hard Hill Country Farmers that are<br>isolated they don't have a lot of<br>options in terms of what they they could<br>do once they get to that point where<br>they've reduced their farming system as<br>far as they could go with technology and<br>improvements what then and if they're<br>looking at diversification forestry is<br>not going to cut it and when you can we<br>can see the damage from from poor Forest<br>regulations management now trees will<br>have a have a place in the future but<br>it's likely to be a higher mixture of of<br>of natives alongside Exotics I've got to<br>say that I'm I am a climate change<br>commissioner but a commissioner but<br>everything that I'm saying today is my<br>own is my own opinion it's my own<br>Viewpoint and I'm not and and this is<br>not the views of<br>um the climate change commission thanks<br>and I think Mel<br>just what a the comment that I made in<br>terms of you protecting agriculture was<br>a comment made to me not by me and it<br>was made from an economy that subsidizes<br>fishing uh and whose fish stocks are<br>going through the floor<br>um and so you know every economy has its<br>challenges what I'd say following on<br>um from those comments were one one one<br>non-negotiable is food security and so<br>no no economy in the Asia Pacific region<br>is going to sacrifice our food Security<br>in service of climate change and so<br>ultimately it is how do you position<br>your sector to be World leading because<br>if a dunon or if an economy has options<br>for purchasing food in to meet its food<br>security needs then it's clearly going<br>to go for the most efficient or uh or<br>thanks I'm going to move to a question<br>to Amanda first and then we'll take some<br>questions oh sorry Eva<br>yeah this is a question for everybody on<br>the panel a comment was made that we<br>might need new institutional structures<br>to address some of these issues I'd be<br>interested in the views of what that<br>might look like and how would it compare<br>with the drivers of some of the<br>commercial realities that we've talked<br>about I'm I you know how are we going to<br>get there quicker is that through these<br>new institutional structures or is it<br>through some of the commercial realities<br>that have been discussed on the panel<br>okay so that was in contrast to our<br>current institutional structures which<br>in some ways<br>I'm not going to say they're a barrier<br>but they're doing they're just doing<br>their job but their job has been shaped<br>over the last hundred years and we need<br>to we need to have structures in place<br>now that can facilitate change and and a<br>key component of that is to shape<br>the thinking in the in the in the mental<br>aptitude that's needed to face an<br>uncertain future<br>and that where we have come from as a<br>sector and I will just talk about the<br>agricultural or primary sector is that<br>we're very good at producing high volume<br>low to medium value products that go in<br>as ingredients into into other value<br>chain systems internationally we need to<br>be able to shift that if I go back to<br>the to the food security point which is<br>really valid that if if we don't<br>structure our systems in a way that we<br>can actually produce food not food<br>ingredients<br>we can we can do that but we also need<br>to be able to produce food domestically<br>for a a growing population in New<br>Zealand that we don't know the extent of<br>the next disaster that's going to that's<br>going to happen we've already had now<br>the Hawke's Bay and East Coast<br>agricultural farming Horticultural<br>sectors that have taken a hit if that<br>happens on a wider scale we need to be<br>able to design new infrastructure for<br>alternative processing and we I mean<br>right now we've got the we've got the<br>fundamentals there to be able to uh to<br>do that but it's around getting the<br>signals right getting the incentives and<br>the penalties in place that will drive<br>that change<br>I I completely agree with Dr what Dr<br>King has said but I would add that<br>a much bigger role for monofinoa and<br>tongata fanua<br>um and much favorable for<br>a more devolved level of governance for<br>some of the infrastructure that we need<br>to provide like the public<br>infrastructure whether that's transport<br>or power networks<br>um<br>and you know noting the points that were<br>made about the issues with our current<br>consenting system I think there's a way<br>to give more power to communities and to<br>monofinoa and properly resource<br>institutions at that level because I<br>think the very large kind of over<br>centralized ones<br>um just aren't going to serve us for the<br>transitions we need to make<br>thanks did you want to make it the only<br>thing I'd add is that clearly the way<br>institutions are set up at the moment is<br>in silos<br>and this<br>particular scenario that we're facing<br>into now cannot be dealt with by silos<br>it either has to be devolved and um and<br>lent into by communities<br>or we have to think differently about<br>how our institutions are constructed and<br>how we work together<br>all I'd say is you got you got three<br>buckets of people in these discussions<br>you've got activists Advocates and<br>actionists and the body politic will<br>always respond to the activists the<br>institutions at the moment are serving<br>The Advocates and that has to move to<br>enabling the actionists and whether<br>that's through Devolution or some other<br>form of of change in our institutional<br>structures we have to stop talking about<br>hopes and dreams and actually start<br>empowering real action that transitions<br>every part of our society Food Systems<br>Energy Systems to concrete outcomes<br>thanks we have another question from the<br>floor if I can ask for them to be fairly<br>brief in the response as well because<br>I've got lots down here as well but<br>please go ahead thank you for for the<br>talks so my question sort of returns to<br>the bigger picture so the talk is about<br>sustaining our natural environment<br>um so it's you know broader in the sense<br>than just carbon emissions and and<br>climate change you know we've got to<br>consider biodiversity and things like<br>that too so my question is how do we get<br>resources and how do we incentivize<br>people to restore our natural<br>environment because we're in a situation<br>where people do that but they're not you<br>know they're not uh they don't benefit<br>from doing so they don't get paid for<br>doing so<br>um so is it do we need something like<br>biodiversity credits or something like<br>that because I'm just thinking of the<br>example where it's five to ten times<br>more profitable to plant monoculture<br>Pines than it is to partner an<br>indigenous native forest and we know<br>that there are significant benefits from<br>planting that Forest the indigenous<br>forest in terms of The Wider ecosystem<br>system and the resilience of the<br>ecosystem so yeah because just how do we<br>shift that um yes<br>Julianne maybe we'll turn to you first<br>uh yeah spot on and I think biodiversity<br>credits could be a place to start but as<br>I mentioned in my opening comments I<br>think we need to have a bigger focus on<br>conservation of land and Marine areas<br>and that part of the economic transition<br>has to be supporting people<br>um so that<br>you know at the moment people who are<br>working in industries that are related<br>to environmental destruction or fossil<br>fuel consumption production you know<br>they they need to worry about their<br>livelihoods and it's just it's a symptom<br>of our economic system not working that<br>it's rewarding activities that extract<br>and pollute rather than rewarding<br>activities that restore and protect and<br>so I do think you know the donut<br>economics model is something you know<br>something we need to shift to um in an<br>aotearoa specific framework you know<br>that incorporates<br>world view and values<br>um so that's like a guaranteed minimum<br>standard of living for everyone and then<br>there's a boundary on what we do in<br>terms of not overly taking from the<br>earth because we can't afford to do that<br>forever<br>any other comments okay well I'm going<br>to move on to a question that's coming<br>from slido<br>um Amanda it's it's directed at um you<br>you did mention there were possibly some<br>remarkable<br>um opportunities but the question that<br>we've got is<br>um you know on this adaptation issue<br>um<br>what's this going to what's this going<br>to require what's the role of companies<br>like your own company<br>um how are we going to move forward with<br>this<br>um and um yeah what's it going to<br>require and I guess including with a<br>focus on these very recent events yeah<br>look I think that we've got multiple<br>round tables and task forces Etc<br>I think it's going to require a speed<br>we're going to need to make decisions<br>very quickly and in these scenarios we<br>know that we're not going to be able to<br>keep everyone happy but I think for us<br>not to move at speed at the moment we'll<br>really waste this opportunity and we'll<br>potentially be putting<br>customers and communities Back In Harm's<br>Way so I'd say it needs speed it also<br>needs it needs stakeholders around the<br>table that are prepared to do things<br>differently and and that is a challenge<br>I think<br>we can't continue to do the same thing<br>and expect a different outcome and those<br>stakeholders definitely need to be<br>coming in with very open minds around<br>how we might solve for things<br>um but it is it's just about it is about<br>leaning in we've got we've got<br>communities here who are in crisis and<br>we have an opportunity to make it make<br>it better and make it more sustainable<br>and how do you see the role of the<br>private sector the the companies such as<br>your own we've got I mean we've got an<br>awful lot of information available that<br>will actually assist government and<br>other other bodies to actually make<br>decisions<br>um so that's a good start<br>um and and then of course we'll we'll<br>have a seat at the table and we'll work<br>through different solutions so we're<br>absolutely committed to supporting<br>yeah thanks very much Jason uh can we<br>uh kyota this uh question is for Malcolm<br>uh just imagine just imagine if you were<br>tomorrow you became the prime minister<br>you became the Prime Minister now what<br>would you do to address those two points<br>that you made about<br>um you know Sweeping in our own backyard<br>and also dealing with the geopolitics<br>and its impact on our ability to address<br>climate changing climate adaptation<br>Gilda<br>um that's a hell of it that's more of a<br>nightmare than an imagination I have to<br>say<br>um<br>you know I think that uh um the first<br>thing uh in terms of sweeping our own<br>back yeah is let's be honest okay let's<br>be honest about what our own backyard<br>looks like<br>um and you know we too are a democracy<br>we too have real bottom lines<br>um uh you know the cost of living crisis<br>has shown that despite our commitment to<br>zero carbon 2050 we're prepared to offer<br>tax breaks on fuel uh fossil fuels okay<br>that's that's a reality so let's just be<br>honest about that stuff uh we live in a<br>democracy and that democracy is going to<br>shape our our ultimate response to<br>climate change in terms of food<br>production we should do everything we<br>possibly can to minimize the impact on<br>our environment from food production but<br>we should never eliminate the fact that<br>we're we're a food producer in the world<br>let's be honest about that let's just be<br>the best food producer that we can be<br>but we have low hanging fruit<br>particularly in transport and Industrial<br>heat and energy transition you can't<br>transition energy if you don't<br>transition assets okay if you've got a<br>combustion engine car you can't put<br>electricity into it so if you focus on<br>transitioning assets the energy<br>transition will occur naturally behind<br>that now to for both of those things to<br>happen you need access to Capital and<br>you need regulatory settings that enable<br>rapid asset transitions in your economy<br>uh you know you don't I I'm just<br>learning the new sector I'm going into<br>but everybody I talk to talks about how<br>hard it is to consent renewable energy<br>development how challenged we are from<br>moving electrons around our country and<br>when we do Distributing them around<br>around our cities Christchurch has an<br>electricity distribution system built to<br>5kva auckland's built to 2kva which city<br>is going to Electrify quicker than the<br>other one okay so those are those are<br>things that I would focus really heavily<br>and until the geopolitics<br>maintaining an independent foreign<br>policy is going to be our biggest asset<br>and our biggest challenge over the next<br>decade<br>well thank you very much I'm actually<br>going to close the questions now because<br>I can see the timer running down that's<br>that's a wonderful move into the next<br>session which of course um is going to<br>be focusing on China and the West so<br>we're taking us right up that<br>International level well I really do um<br>sincerely thank these these panelists um<br>Julianne on online uh our three<br>panelists in person I think we'll all<br>agree that the insights that they bought<br>were incredibly Rich quite diverse<br>insights we've got sectoral insights<br>we've got government insights uh we yeah<br>just the wealth of experience and<br>insights that you bought I think are<br>very much appreciated also appreciate<br>the questions that came through from the<br>audience so I'd like to thank our<br>panelists very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
