speaker Adrian Orr - Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand - Te PÅ«tea Matua.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>curating uh good morning all excellent<br>to see you bright and early I said<br>yesterday that we very rarely get fog in<br>the waikato these days<br>remarkable coincidence uh two in a row<br>um we're really looking forward to<br>today's program and thanks everybody for<br>a stunning day yesterday including the<br>dinner for those that could make it so<br>we're about to be joined by the governor<br>of The Reserve Bank Adrian Orr we will<br>then move into a session on governance<br>and populism<br>uh back then on to monetary policy the<br>report card looking at the review of The<br>Last Five Years brief break they keep<br>coming Crown Maori relations<br>sustaining our natural environments and<br>then finish up with our session on China<br>in the west so it's um it's a pretty<br>full program for the morning with the<br>governor in a moment he's going to make<br>some remarks we'll have a small amount<br>of time at the end for questions so as<br>yesterday or for new faces in the room<br>or on the live stream if you're on the<br>computer click the button for slido<br>otherwise there are details on your<br>table and please get questions coming<br>through slido or we'll have a roaming<br>mic on the floor and Adrian please<br>foreign<br>thank you very much for uh for the<br>invitation and to be here and it's<br>wonderful to be surrounded by the bulges<br>again so um a great honor and um and<br>everything I have to say we can blame<br>them and and things should be fine<br>wonderful to be back here also at<br>waikato University<br>um it has sent out some very fine<br>graduates and and me so um it's a<br>beautiful place it's beautiful to be<br>back here as well<br>before I start I also just want to note<br>we've got a couple of members from<br>tiputia matua The Reserve Bank in the<br>audience with you as well James Sergeant<br>um uh sitting over here and and Paul<br>Conway Paul will be up later on and I<br>note that because I'm very keen that um<br>you do get to chat with the bank<br>um we're open we want to collaborate<br>we're ready for business and so we are<br>here<br>uh I'd be wrong not to start the address<br>by acknowledging the extreme hardship<br>that many new zealanders in the upper<br>North Island are going through at the<br>moment<br>um Our Hearts and Thoughts uh with them<br>and it is a significant challenge we<br>have ahead<br>um for the short term and I'm really<br>pleased with the agenda uh Matt that<br>sustainability and and adaptation is all<br>part of The Courier as well over time so<br>we have really big issues<br>today my topic is around about how our<br>work at The Reserve Bank tiputia matuk<br>can best contribute to economic<br>well-being and prosperity I'm going to<br>be reasonably formal because there's a<br>written speech that goes on record for<br>those who didn't understand my mumbling<br>you can go and read later for a good<br>sleep therapy and it's all there<br>uh<br>in terms of contributing to our economic<br>well-being and prosperity<br>um that is our purpose our reason on<br>debt our reason for being and uh it is<br>uh the key opening line of our new<br>legislation that I'll talk you through<br>uh I'll chat through about our<br>legislation our policy remits and how<br>these commitments shape uh the very<br>broad work we manage at tiputi MR2 and<br>in particular the trade-offs that we<br>inevitably face from time to time so<br>it's going to be a lot about optimizing<br>subject too<br>throughout the speech uh I won't say as<br>you know because I'm not sure people do<br>know that we have actually three strands<br>main strands of work at the Central Bank<br>the first one of course is monetary<br>policy we are the proud Monopoly<br>supplier of the fiat currency the New<br>Zealand dollar and with that monetary<br>policy we aim to keep Consumer Price<br>inflation low and stable Through Time<br>it's our desire that the purchasing<br>power of our currency is strong and that<br>you know that the dollar meets the three<br>kind of criteria of a currency that it<br>is seen as a unit of account<br>a means of exchange and a store of value<br>otherwise it's not a currency<br>of course we are humble very humble in<br>our ability to achieve stable Consumer<br>Price inflation all of the time our<br>tools are suitably limited and they're<br>very long and uncertain lags between<br>what we do with interest rates and the<br>inflation outcomes that are achieved<br>meanwhile economic shocks are just that<br>for example in my time as governor and<br>every Governor has their own list the<br>shocks we've gone through we've endured<br>the covid-19 global meltdown uh the<br>impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine<br>and now of course the events impacting<br>the North Island through these severe<br>weather events these events by the way<br>are historically significant the<br>movements and output inflation<br>employment are historically significant<br>as we've gone through this period<br>we don't determine the context the<br>economic context we operate in instead<br>we're left to react to that context with<br>those long legs and we react with a very<br>clear purpose that we State strongly and<br>often which is aiming for Price<br>stability<br>and our role is to continue to build on<br>a reputation for delivering low and<br>stable inflation expectations<br>always for looking always thinking about<br>the context and reacting that that path<br>is well beaten the second strand of our<br>work of course is promoting Financial<br>stability<br>we aim to both lower the probability and<br>the impact of financial institutions and<br>insurers getting into trouble or failing<br>it's critical for a modern economy that<br>these institutions are able to<br>continuously Supply the services to<br>people they are built on trust and<br>critical to an economy<br>and then the third main strand of our<br>work is delivering all of the other<br>functions the Central Bank delivers<br>ensuring the supply of cash throughout<br>the economy<br>transactionally banking the banks<br>themselves and using overseeing and<br>operating all of the critical payment<br>and settlement systems so those latter<br>two roles are often overlooked because<br>of the excitement of the headlines of<br>what have we done with the official cash<br>rate<br>and delivering on these three strands of<br>work there is a lot of balancing and<br>trade-offs that we must always Undertake<br>and acknowledge<br>so there's plenty of judgment there's a<br>wide range of knowledge and inputs that<br>we look and seek for there's a lot of<br>conventional economic tools we have and<br>then of course we have our financial<br>capital and our people around the tools<br>and Frameworks to try to succeed through<br>all of this we aim to be transparent<br>and understood by the broad public so we<br>spend a lot of time around transparency<br>and that people can see what we're doing<br>and how we came to these decisions<br>looking ahead for us our big challenges<br>we want to shift you know and like<br>everyone does in the Jim Collins World<br>from good to great for us to be<br>exceptional what we're doing at the bank<br>is looking and working holistically<br>across all three aspects of that bank to<br>glean the best data the best insights<br>and to best be able to manage the<br>trade-offs which I'll talk about as we<br>can so I was thinking about it you know<br>in the in the world of algorithms when<br>Central Bankers are replaced by an<br>algorithm uh what are we trying to do<br>well we're trying to maximize several<br>objectives<br>um subject to taking no undue<br>operational Legal Financial reputation<br>risk I say no undue there is risk to<br>everything we take you need to have a<br>risk to get a reward but it's the undue<br>risk we try to avoid Through Time<br>so some of the examples around you know<br>that maximizing subject too uh very to<br>bring it tangible<br>we're asked to pursue low and stable<br>inflation and contribute to maximum<br>sustainable employment<br>but doing that without creating undue<br>volatility and output interest rates in<br>the exchange rate<br>so embedded in that simple statement is<br>already two significant balancing acts<br>we need to take we're asked to maximize<br>Financial system soundness<br>while also supporting efficiency<br>competition Innovation and financial<br>inclusion<br>we're asked to promote certainty of cash<br>availability while also promoting<br>Technology Innovation in payments and<br>settlement systems<br>we're asked to ensure we have robust<br>payment and settlement systems while<br>encouraging competition and innovation<br>and we're being asked to be the<br>liquidity provider you know in an<br>extreme financial event while also<br>trying to minimize moral hazard and<br>Market behavior and of course be prudent<br>with our own balance sheet so you can<br>see through those basic things there is<br>no one objective function there are many<br>and all of them come with subject two<br>subject to subject two so our task is<br>always to build a consistent coherent<br>transparent framework that we can<br>explain to the public our customers what<br>we're doing and why we're doing it<br>across all aspects of our work we need<br>to know what the objectives are what the<br>trade-offs are and what our risk<br>appetite is to achieving these<br>uh I'll put it now into what is our new<br>legislation and I think it's really<br>important that people do have a look<br>this is your back tiputia martyr our<br>Central Bank<br>um so in terms of the hierarchy of<br>objectives that we have<br>um which forms you know the basis of the<br>trade-offs and the criteria that we use<br>in our business at the top of that<br>pyramid who's the Reserve Bank act it's<br>given the authority to carry out the<br>tasks I just mentioned through new<br>legislation there's a new Reserve Bank<br>act 2021 that came in in two action mid<br>last year and it replaced the 1989 to 30<br>year old act a lot of the stuff is the<br>same but there are important nuances and<br>differences<br>this foundational legislation is is very<br>clear you know our purpose is to promote<br>prosperity and well-being of all new<br>zealanders and contribute to a<br>sustainable and productive economy that<br>is the opening Preamble and its explicit<br>recognition that you know the activities<br>we take undertake as a central bank are<br>a means to an end they're not the end in<br>themselves and so we always have to have<br>that connectedness back to society<br>around promoting a sustainable and<br>productive economy<br>underneath the legislation sits our<br>remits these are negotiated and agreed<br>and signed by the Minister of Finance<br>the agreements and while we have<br>statutory independence from the<br>government the remit documents<br>explicitly outline what the government<br>of the day wishes us to take into<br>account when undertaking our our three<br>main tasks we've got a new one a<br>financial policy remit and it states in<br>pursuing Financial stability the<br>government seeks strong institutions<br>that we have to act with proportionate<br>regulation<br>they want consistency of treatment<br>across across our regulated institutions<br>maintain competition and have<br>consideration for efficiency inclusion<br>Innovation and amongst all that have a<br>low incidence of failure of institutions<br>so we've got the legislation then we've<br>got this remit the monetary policy<br>agreement the one that has been around<br>for a long time now outlines the<br>government's desire for medium-term<br>Price stability and maximum sustainable<br>employment<br>but also ensuring soundness of the<br>financial system and avoiding<br>unnecessary instability and output<br>interest rates in the exchange rate<br>so<br>a clear objective function but lots of<br>secondary criteria that we need to have<br>regard to and be able to explain back to<br>the people how we are doing it<br>so the remits and the legislation are<br>our guiding North Star they give us a<br>very clear direction of where we have to<br>go but they don't tell us how to get<br>there that is left back inside tiputia<br>mature and with Ward there's one other<br>stage actually we also receive annually<br>a letter of expectations and again these<br>are public they're on our website and<br>it's another way of the government of<br>the day guiding what would be in our<br>statement of intent you know our five<br>year ahead and what they expect to see<br>us being measured against our statement<br>of performance<br>so we've got legislation we've got<br>remits and we've got letters of<br>expectations all of that comes together<br>in a hierarchical structure<br>with plenty and plenty of guidance but<br>what is critical to understand is<br>there's no single first best optimal<br>calibration of it all<br>instead we are optimizing various<br>outcomes so various time Horizons<br>subject to managing other specific risks<br>related to that Legal Financial<br>reputation operational aspects of our<br>work<br>so the algorithm is starting to look<br>quite complex isn't it not sure it's<br>even one algorithm we're maximizing aims<br>subject to no undue risk I'll bring it<br>into real-time issues now I'll start<br>with monetary policy you know the best<br>example of a trade-off in action here is<br>where we're required to keep inflation<br>within a Target band and support maximum<br>sustainable employment<br>while also having regard to these other<br>factors the efficiency soundness<br>unnecessary instability and discounting<br>transitory events looking through for<br>example at the moment the obvious one is<br>severe weather condition near-term price<br>spikes how do we look through that and<br>focus on generalized inflation rather<br>than jumping to relative price concerns<br>the first part of the trade-off relates<br>to this dual Mandate of low and stable<br>inflation and maximum sustainable<br>employment<br>uh mostly there is no trade-off when<br>inflation is high employment is strong<br>unemployment is low as it is now across<br>all those three variables<br>um it all points to raising interest<br>rates in an effort to slow domestic<br>spending to better match the supply<br>capacity of the economy so that's all<br>straightforward but of course there can<br>and will be trade-offs in the future if<br>we're faced with for example stagflation<br>I don't met in the audience here are<br>fortunately like myself old enough to<br>remember what that felt like where you<br>have a period of low growth you have<br>Rising unemployment but still high<br>inflation then what do we do do we raise<br>interest rates to slow inflation or do<br>we lower interest rates to to try to<br>maximize employment<br>so that's where these trade-offs begin<br>to bite I want to calm the audience<br>because it's without doubt across<br>Central Banking knowledge history<br>economic understanding that a Central<br>Bank in that situation has to be<br>Resolute to bring inflation down<br>and we need to bring inflation back to a<br>target range but of course we need to do<br>it over a reasonable Horizon<br>um so as not to unnecessarily crash the<br>economy and turn temporary slower growth<br>and do permanent unemployment so it's a<br>horizon challenge the second part of the<br>trade-off of course is how far and how<br>fast do we Reign inflation in without<br>creating that worse outcome overall<br>here we need to have regard to these<br>other issues around Financial stability<br>and unnecessary volatility<br>and that's where the balancing act gets<br>really hot<br>I do recall um I think it was Mervin<br>King who started a few next move with<br>the interest rate is really difficult to<br>to make it means you're probably in a<br>good position at the moment if your next<br>move is really obvious you're in the<br>wrong position<br>so I left in the official cash rate too<br>fast or too far can for example lead to<br>a severe downturn uh spending and<br>investment collapses and you end up with<br>a much higher exchange rate because<br>foreign exchange dealers chase the<br>higher yielding in the New Zealand<br>dollar and you crash the export sector<br>and all economies have been through that<br>before so there's that Balancing Act<br>between inflation expectations being<br>controlled but not going crazy and<br>crashing the economy<br>in the financial stability place we're<br>faced with very similar trade-offs our<br>remit says that the government wants a<br>financial system that is strong<br>efficient and inclusive as we know if<br>you want to make a bank strong you limit<br>the amount of risk taking they can have<br>undertake however by doing that of<br>course you undermine then the efficiency<br>of the financial system itself<br>um you know modern Banks and regulator I<br>say modern in the last 200 years realize<br>that Landing out deposits is a<br>manageable risk likewise borrowing short<br>term for The Banks deposit rates and<br>lending longer terms is also a<br>manageable risk but we have to accept<br>that risk and we have to be able to<br>manage that risk and accept that this is<br>not a zero failure situation<br>you know a very specific example and one<br>that caused a lot of challenge when it<br>was being implemented I wasn't Governor<br>at the time is the imposition of loan to<br>value<br>restrictions this limits the amount of<br>high risk low Equity loans that you can<br>make to um to their customers we don't<br>want too many people of course borrowing<br>with no equity to back it up because any<br>sudden drop in value suddenly puts<br>households in stress and if it's<br>widespread it puts the banking system<br>under danger and we can see that having<br>some kind of constraint on on loan to<br>value restrictions makes Financial<br>stability sense<br>but of course it can also significantly<br>impose inefficiency across the system if<br>you take anything too far you know a<br>first home buyer may not have the<br>hundred thousand dollars they need for a<br>deposit but they may have a steady job a<br>good salary good future income prospects<br>growing income and so they could easily<br>honor a mortgage commitment for them<br>borrowing would be restrictive if they<br>can't you know if you had that<br>restriction on the loan to value ratio<br>and so this is why<br>an example of our risk habitat at the<br>bank is we allow Banks to have some high<br>lvr lending and it's for banks to work<br>out who are the recipients of those High<br>lvr loans it's not at a zero position<br>um you know there's plenty of analogies<br>around speed limits on cars and so on<br>and so forth you know this is the lvr<br>situation uh banks are allowed to make<br>some of their loans but not all of their<br>loans<br>um is high risk activity Financial<br>inclusion<br>um this is a really interesting topic<br>and one that um is front and center for<br>us and our financial policy remit we all<br>know that Financial inclusion is a key<br>import or key component of economic<br>well-being it's also specifically<br>referenced as I said in in our financial<br>policy remit and letters of expectations<br>we have to have regard to it we are<br>actively playing a bigger part of our<br>role in financial inclusion it's<br>involving a lot of analysis<br>and work across places that we haven't<br>been too often to better ensure people<br>can access the financial system and<br>endure its benefits a lack of financial<br>inclusion is not good it leads to poor<br>availability and accessible safe<br>Financial Services<br>it restricts access to banking Insurance<br>all of the things that we believe are<br>critical for a modern economy and it<br>leads to many societal problems<br>um if you were forced to go to payday<br>loans with high interest rates and all<br>sorts of uh<br>heinous activities then you have<br>significant societal issues so we are<br>working with the finance sector and<br>other stakeholders to develop our<br>understanding of what what is meant by<br>Financial inclusion and really holding a<br>mirror up to ourselves around what are<br>our actions doing to increase or<br>decrease Financial inclusion<br>and our longer term aim is it just<br>becomes part of our DNA on the way<br>through<br>for example I would say you know it's<br>Financial inclusion is really obvious<br>for some parts of our work and less<br>obvious the links are harder I think<br>about access to cash Financial inclusion<br>is very critical to call considerations<br>around that whereas the link between<br>Financial inclusion and financial<br>stability uh more distant and we have to<br>think harder around you know you could<br>make an incredibly sound financial<br>system by excluding everyone and making<br>no loans but would that would that be<br>inclusive<br>uh so many examples across our<br>activities that we need to articulate as<br>particularly around our appetite for<br>actively addressing barriers to<br>inclusion and defining what the<br>trade-offs are currently in front of us<br>we've got significant work around our<br>new deposit takers legislation this has<br>been going through the house it'll soon<br>be an act and in that we have to assess<br>how we will use and operate that<br>legislation supervising all the deposit<br>takers and the choices we need to make<br>on on regulatory proportionality<br>by that we mean you can't have the one<br>rule for all because you would end up<br>excluding an enormous amount of<br>efficiency and Innovation going on uh<br>we're also thinking around Financial<br>inclusion with our new role around<br>stewarding within the Cash System<br>producing storing Distributing cash to<br>the public and we have to do that with a<br>wide range of participants the banks the<br>cash and Transit companies<br>a whole host of folk going on and<br>inclusion is one of the key principles<br>we're thinking about in our work at the<br>moment considering a central bank<br>digital currency<br>um so you can see inclusion is important<br>I'll bring it home<br>some communities for example rely very<br>heavily on cash and more heavily than<br>other people<br>um in their daily life<br>but ensuring wide access to cash and<br>it's making you sure it is accepted in<br>its use is very expensive for banks<br>businesses and customers<br>so how do you get that Financial<br>inclusion going at the expense of<br>alternative means of transaction there<br>is a trade-off<br>we are juggling that efficiency versus<br>inclusion I do have to say that you know<br>the recent severe weather events<br>throughout the North Island reminded us<br>again that when the power is off when<br>you have no telecommunications physical<br>cash becomes king once again and then<br>the absence of a means of exchange a<br>trusted means of exchange when it's<br>suddenly gone leads to almost immediate<br>social cohesion challenge<br>we've seen that globally and we've been<br>observing that in recent days here in<br>artery New Zealand we also want to make<br>a payment system that encourages and<br>enables Innovation this may be a central<br>bank digital currency we're working<br>through on that<br>um loved the idea because it Fosters<br>Innovation it can reduce costs and<br>banking it enables faster and more<br>secure payments and it encourages<br>greater competition all these beautiful<br>things but by doing so you're exposing<br>yourself to new risks operational risks<br>reputational risks because you've got<br>more and more Reliance on certain pinch<br>points around technology so again The<br>Innovation versus the inclusion versus<br>efficiency and soundness are all<br>balancing Acts what are the criteria for<br>doing all this well um our board our<br>newly empowered board I'm very proud of<br>it by the way the chair of the board of<br>course is also the vice Chancellor of<br>waikato University<br>Professor Neil Quigley they now have a<br>an appropriately empowered board as<br>opposed to an overseeing board they have<br>to own<br>the risk appetite and make the risk<br>appetite very clear to the public of New<br>Zealand and how they are going to accept<br>risks and manage the trade-offs uh they<br>have to understand what the economic<br>underpinnings are of all of our<br>activities and when we're standing on<br>what I would say<br>facts versus<br>well-held beliefs<br>beliefs around how economies work<br>um all the different economic models and<br>Frameworks what are those underpinnings<br>and how is that research giving us<br>confidence that those beliefs hold true<br>so we're working with the board around<br>Clarity of our objectives<br>the understanding of the hierarchy<br>involved across our legislation our<br>remits and all of these other<br>expectations are articulating our risk<br>appetite statements and and what it<br>means and implies across their<br>activities creating awareness of what<br>facts we stand on when we make decisions<br>but also building trust in the beliefs<br>that we hold in undertaking our business<br>and in those beliefs this is where you<br>know I look to the audience and<br>Incredibly well educated audience this<br>is where we need help continuously<br>around the research and the challenging<br>and testing around what is the academic<br>or empirical evidence around the beliefs<br>of the work we're doing<br>it's only then when the board you know<br>when the board has Clarity and<br>objectives hierarchies the risks uh<br>facts and beliefs it's only then a board<br>can sit back and say<br>um we have confidence in the activities<br>that we are doing and we are able to<br>assess the resources we need financial<br>and human resources people we need to<br>undertake the activities and we know<br>when we are being prudent with our<br>balance sheet so it's a wonderful<br>holistic opportunity that's coming<br>together through this legislation to<br>make all of this happen<br>of course<br>um all of these capabilities and<br>capacities will have to change through<br>time and again they change driven by<br>factors outside of our control<br>technology demographics societal<br>expectations are changing continuously<br>and that will change the types of<br>capabilities capacities Financial<br>Resources we need Central Banking is not<br>static it is dynamic<br>um of course bringing us all of this<br>together at the shop underpinning any<br>institution are our values and our<br>culture and we've been spending an<br>enormous amount of work on identifying<br>the values we need and the culture that<br>will work for us that we can operate<br>holistically as a central bank across<br>these groups this is why we introduced<br>the TR Maori framework into our<br>discussions and our work it's arturoa<br>homegrown it's a link between Prosperity<br>inclusion sustainability cohesion why<br>wouldn't you adopt a framework that is<br>ready and understood to be able to<br>explain what we're doing and work as a<br>holistic single unit<br>building our cultural capability also<br>recognizes the unique position of course<br>of rtro in New Zealand of tangata fenua<br>and the role of titurity or watangi so<br>you know these are uh both uh necessary<br>and and a critical part of the culture<br>and values and role that we play and<br>particularly helping us shift from that<br>good to great in in that Central Banking<br>uh building the cultural capability has<br>also provided some pretty amazing and<br>critical insights around an important<br>growing component of the Arturo economy<br>Maori economic activity the Renaissance<br>of Maori business and some of the unique<br>ownership structures and and<br>decision-making structures that go there<br>I have to say our recent work looking to<br>improve access to capital for Maori<br>business has been eye-opening<br>um surprisingly too much eye-opening for<br>financial institutions in New Zealand we<br>have to try harder we need to serve the<br>people of Arturo and New Zealand better<br>and so that is some of the Mahi that<br>we're involved in we're also growing our<br>climate risk expertise and again and<br>this is about understanding the<br>challenges and risks to the economy and<br>the financial system the risks to the<br>central bank and our role and the role<br>of the financial system in mitigation<br>edit and adaptation going forward the<br>Reserve Bank act makes it clear we have<br>to have this wider regard and we would<br>be foolish in any economic sense not to<br>have regard to this work<br>uh so looking ahead and just you know<br>kind of in conclusion and this is the<br>Widow that I'll put on the table this is<br>where we need help to collaborate and<br>work together with the wisdom that is<br>New Zealand's academic great<br>um many of whom are in this room and I<br>hope some who are online<br>um we have a long tradition of pursuing<br>policy relevant research<br>we are a full service Central Bank so<br>not all of our researchers around<br>monetary policy it is across all of the<br>aspects we just talked about the three<br>strands our recent review and I see it's<br>a topic du jour in an hour or so our the<br>review and assessment of the formulation<br>and impropriation of monetary policy<br>not hell of a mouthful we didn't come up<br>with that title um you know the recent<br>review has highlighted some really<br>critical lessons from the last five<br>years<br>at the moment we have research going on<br>around Supply driven shocks to inflation<br>demand-driven shocks to inflation and<br>climate related risks to inflation so<br>all of this work is going on and Paul<br>Conway is there I'm sure he'll touch on<br>bits of it later on this morning our<br>research work on financial stability is<br>also extensive I've already talked about<br>how we are going to be proportioning our<br>activity around the deposit takers act<br>but we're also working on what is an<br>optimal deposit compensation scheme look<br>like with you know we are now entering<br>the world of the hundred thousand dollar<br>maximum payout if a bank fails on on<br>your deposit so on so forth implementing<br>that working on developing and<br>understanding the macro Prudential tools<br>we have I've talked about the loan to<br>value ratio but we look at deposit to<br>income restrictions how do they<br>intersect with our normal Prudential<br>tools capital and liquidity and what is<br>the optimal calibration of these tools<br>together through a Financial cycle so it<br>is complex work and remember we're<br>balancing soundness efficiency and<br>inclusion<br>so we have to be optimizing across a lot<br>of activity our future of money program<br>which is well established now has seen<br>us engage very very broadly across New<br>Zealand and internationally and that's<br>better to better understand our money<br>and payments needs across the country<br>I've talked about the cash but what<br>about a central bank digital currency<br>how does that fit around inclusion<br>efficiency Innovation<br>so you know these are really really<br>important topics that we need your help<br>to understand and I've continued we're<br>continuing to work around improving<br>access to capital for small to<br>medium-sized Enterprises and for the<br>Maori economy that's really important<br>Mahi and I believe it will be a big part<br>of unlocking the potential of RTR a<br>broad range of climate change research<br>is going on and we're hanging with the<br>best in New Zealand we're relying on the<br>science from from the experts in this<br>field but we're bringing it into our Roy<br>and about how does it impact on<br>financial stability what are the roles<br>for the banks and insurers around<br>adaptation mitigation and how can we<br>provide stress tests quite morbidly last<br>year it was in the last year we ran<br>stress tests for the banks where we had<br>three floods back to back in Auckland<br>and to see what that would do for the<br>banking system unfortunately it turned<br>out to be quite fortuitous but it's all<br>about raising awareness capability<br>capacity within the banking system and<br>insurance activity to manage this stuff<br>and internationally we're engaged with<br>the network for Greening the financial<br>system a Global Network I think it's<br>well 120 plus central banks and other<br>financial institutions we're leading one<br>of the work streams around Central Bank<br>Net Zero we're leading that with the<br>bank of Italy and that's around<br>sustainable investment greeting our own<br>operations but most importantly<br>developing climate related disclosures<br>from financial institutions<br>so in summary I think you might have<br>gleaned at the world of Central Banking<br>comes with many many trade-offs to be<br>made and they're much Uncharted water<br>left out there that we have to get<br>through and I can't emphasize enough<br>that we are a learning institution we<br>seek input we want to collaborate and<br>you know that's the word or that I put<br>on please come and work alongside us we<br>need to be doing this on many topics as<br>per the conversations we've had<br>um I think probably the nicest<br>if you want to Pedal fast paddle alone<br>if you want to Pedal far<br>paddle together<br>thank you very much<br>yeah as long as the audience can suffer<br>them all right<br>that'll be quite a few questions have<br>come through and we won't go too long<br>but first thank you really<br>um fascinating oversight for many of us<br>who you're quite right we see the<br>announcements on the on the cash rate we<br>sometimes don't see the other parts of<br>the operations of the bank so some of<br>the questions that were coming through<br>picked up on your theme about the<br>trade-offs uh the the complexity of<br>managing those tensions<br>and one was given those trade-offs that<br>are inherently already there<br>can you provide some clarity on the Dual<br>mandate<br>the current mandate<br>given the question says that the poor<br>experience of other central banks<br>pursuing this policy and I guess I'll<br>extend that<br>given so many other trade-offs inherent<br>is it simpler to actually have the<br>single mandate<br>uh<br>no I think you know a single mandate has<br>the trade-offs that are expressed anyway<br>in the Dual mandate the history the<br>short history of New Zealand inflation<br>targeting was that we've always had to<br>have regard to avoiding unnecessary<br>instability and output interest rates<br>and the exchange rate and we've always<br>had to have regard to Where Do We<br>Believe employment is relative to its<br>maximum sustainable level that is called<br>potential output that is the potential<br>growth rate of an economy and through<br>that output Gap type framework it's<br>always there so whether you make it<br>explicit in the PTA or implicit that's<br>really a political decision in reality<br>it's there<br>thank you<br>I'll stay then on some of the trade-offs<br>we'll have a longer discussion with Paul<br>and others on the The Five-Year review<br>shortly one question that comes up is<br>uh obviously you identified quite a few<br>learnings in there Supply shocks and and<br>so on<br>given the increase in asset prices and<br>perhaps the unexpectedly small impact on<br>employment and jobs<br>was the discussion why wasn't there a<br>conclusion about there may have been too<br>much stimulus in the earlier parts of<br>the pandemic yeah I I would just invite<br>and Paul can go on that I would invite<br>people to actually go and read the<br>document<br>um because generally I get comments from<br>people who haven't actually read our<br>document and in that document we talk<br>about uh monetary policy whether the<br>impacts were different than anticipated<br>the answer is no the biggest surprise<br>was the continuous series of shocks All<br>in One Direction<br>from from covert from Ukraine and and<br>now more recently from the severe events<br>so it's not monetary policy remains<br>focused over the medium term around<br>price stability but when you're getting<br>hit with continuous shocks um welcome to<br>the world the real world we live in so<br>and then within that document we say<br>what are some of the lessons yes at the<br>margin we could have started tightening<br>sooner but even there within the<br>documents and we show even then rather<br>than the seven percent inflation it<br>would have been six point something<br>so again even tightening sooner didn't<br>really change the fact that we're well<br>outside of the inflation Target as is<br>every other over City Country because of<br>the nature of the economic shocks<br>um thank you can I um<br>there's a question here on composition<br>of monetary policy committee and I might<br>come to that in a moment<br>when you run us through that list of of<br>trade-offs that you're facing at an<br>operational level can you give us a<br>window into the Frameworks you and the<br>team use<br>to actually go through that number of<br>you know legislative remits other things<br>letters of expectation how do you an<br>operational level week to week<br>day-to-day run through those trade-offs<br>and analyze the impacts yeah I'll try<br>I'll try and so very<br>um simply the first thing of course is<br>uh not all committees are involved on<br>all the one topics you know so we have<br>dedicated efforts around Financial<br>stability committee the monetary policy<br>committee the payment and cash<br>settlement committees so very dedicated<br>Resources with their own with their own<br>objective functions<br>um with Clarity around the criteria they<br>must try and maximize those objective<br>functions around I'm sorry sounding so<br>Bland and increasingly a more explicit<br>awareness of the risks they have to<br>actively seek to achieve those outcomes<br>so once you've got that very clear it<br>doesn't become as complex as it sounds<br>if you aren't if you don't have those<br>clear then how do you know you're<br>optimizing and how can you truly explain<br>to the public what you're actually doing<br>and how do you know if you've got the<br>optimal resources the appropriate skills<br>the balance sheet Etc to achieve those<br>outcomes so that is the clarity that we<br>need in the Central Banking world that<br>Clarity has been long held in modern<br>times at least for monetary policy the<br>monetary policy committee the<br>projections The Horizon all of those<br>tools and things that people are used to<br>financial stability has been more<br>complex it's a far more supportive you<br>know it's a very heterogeneous topic<br>there's many different facets to it and<br>so bringing that under one type of<br>umbrella is a real important challenge<br>for the bank ongoing it's been a poor<br>cousin Prudential regulation it's now<br>holistically being thought about around<br>Financial sides and you know cash and<br>payment settlement systems I would say<br>at The Reserve Bank that was seen as the<br>folk that just shift trolleys around<br>down in the basement and um and do<br>physical cash<br>yet it's at the core of our Essence it's<br>the sap in in what we're doing so again<br>bringing that into that holistic picture<br>around a means of Exchange<br>how is that going to be able to enhance<br>societal Behavior okay that's a sorry<br>waffling but no it's a great one to go<br>into and I think um<br>uh next year we're looking at launching<br>a uh Bachelor of financial technology<br>fintech here at the University and at<br>the management school because it's such<br>a critical topic ranging from back<br>office Clearinghouse functions right<br>through to central bank digital<br>currencies the cbdc can you explain to<br>us a great illustration there when the<br>system goes down when the fbos doesn't<br>work when you need suppliers it's a<br>flooding situation this is just<br>happening last week can you talk to us<br>though what what might a central bank<br>digital currency look like I think for<br>some of us it's hard to actually<br>understand what that means we can<br>already pay with our phones what's what<br>would be different so I I just um start<br>on that first but resilience you know as<br>wood du jour around the world and<br>certainly here in Arturo and New Zealand<br>at the moment resilience was around<br>Supply chains falling apart during<br>covert uh resilience now is about about<br>um uh almost all activities in New<br>Zealand from the Cook Strait Ferry<br>through to getting cash out of an ATM we<br>are so thinly spread uh it's all just in<br>time there's no just in case mentality<br>going on in in corporate society and so<br>we need to build up that resilience we<br>need to have uh in the simple cash<br>management side yes you may not use it<br>day to day and all the time but when you<br>need it it has to be available and<br>immediately so so what are we doing<br>around increasing that resilience the<br>availability of cash the ability to<br>store cash across regions so and so<br>forth that is critical and a central<br>bank digital currency is not going to<br>remove the need for that resilience you<br>are going to have to be able to operate<br>without power without Communications and<br>without the law of the gun deciding who<br>gets the loaf of bread so so you know<br>that that is critical a central bank<br>digital currency meanwhile is simply an<br>electronic signal that sits in the<br>central bank that says uh IOU something<br>so it's no different to an electric<br>signal that sits in a retail bank except<br>this time it's with the central bank and<br>because it's with the central bank it's<br>narrow money it is the true fiat<br>currency rather than broader money money<br>created by the retail Banks themselves<br>you know through fractional banking so<br>it is a true it's the equivalent of<br>having a physical one dollar a physical<br>note you've got an electronic signal<br>with the same Insider high-powered<br>one-to-one relationship if you all we<br>all know this and I don't want to create<br>a sudden rush for the door if you're<br>just realizing it that if we all went to<br>try and take all of our deposits out<br>right now the banks wouldn't have it you<br>know they they lend out far more than<br>they physically Halt and that is that's<br>um<br>fractional banking but with the<br>one-to-one Central Bank digital currency<br>it's there it's backed by the crown the<br>crown balance sheet current and all<br>future taxpayers so that so that's the<br>idea<br>where who holds it<br>um uh electronic signal is the really<br>critical part<br>does a central bank hold it and Bank<br>everyone transactionally or does the<br>Central Bank allow retail Banks to hold<br>their electric signal and customers have<br>a choice between uh Bank a money or<br>Central Bank money on their accounts how<br>do they split those two so that is where<br>it gets important because the central<br>bank is not the risk allocator of<br>capital around that that is done through<br>the very important role of banks to<br>allocate that capital on a you know on a<br>risk-based manner so so that's so it's<br>so simple at the heart what makes it<br>different to a Bitcoin or to a um a<br>stable coin well it's the central banks<br>money it's not someone else's IOU or I<br>promise it's not Zuckerberg's promise or<br>around you'll all be good for it if you<br>ever need it back it's it is a fiat<br>currency promise thank you it's really<br>useful I'm just going to check if there<br>any questions from the floor yes we'll<br>this is probably the last one<br>better be good<br>no pressure<br>Adrian the answer yeah so um having<br>given that you've been talking about<br>digital currency and so we're looking at<br>the balance sheet of uh te puta matua<br>are you having any issues that the<br>Deutsche bundesbank is currently having<br>with a a very bad p l with all their<br>very low paying bonds that they're<br>holding is that something that's<br>emerging for tiputia matua well I notice<br>an emotion there<br>um what is the balance sheet of a<br>central bank<br>the central bank doesn't even need<br>Equity we print the stuff<br>so it's the world where accountants have<br>met the world of economics<br>and at the moment Central Bank Mark to<br>markets around the world are either<br>positive or negative it doesn't make any<br>difference to the actual Central Bank<br>Unless somehow their credibility is is<br>being attacked I.E you're printing money<br>with no sense of ever making it low<br>stable inflation through time so that's<br>the Venezuela or the Zimbabwe or the<br>Argentina meanwhile central banks who<br>are committed to low unstable inflation<br>and have that credibility the equity and<br>the balance sheet is is effectively<br>noise<br>so um but wow it looks different oh I<br>haven't seen that before and I was told<br>in accounting you know you must have<br>positive equity in this so it hurts the<br>brain<br>but you need to exercise that brain and<br>there's some wonderful reading around<br>central bank balance sheets the bis are<br>out on their public Mission at the<br>moment to explain to people calm down<br>it's okay I love the U.S federal<br>reserves balance sheet they are always<br>square at the end of the day because the<br>way they do it is their Equity is the<br>discounted future seniority that they<br>get and so magically it balances off<br>each day I'll let you think about that<br>so my point was actually more the p l<br>um I know the Deutsche bundes Bank was<br>um you know obviously pays out surpluses<br>and it pays deposits for its retail<br>Banks it's got into a position where in<br>fact the money that it's earning of its<br>portfolio is significantly less than the<br>deposit if money it's paying out I mean<br>again it could well be just an<br>accounting issue rather than a real<br>issue but it's certainly something<br>that's quite live okay it's making<br>headlines it's a reputational challenge<br>you know that's about about balancing<br>reputation operational Financial legal<br>risk reputational if you've set our<br>reputations based on us having positive<br>capital and then you don't well you've<br>got some explaining to do<br>um uh The Reserve Bank is quite unique<br>and I won't say optimal it's just unique<br>at how it is we were given a slugger<br>capital and we're told to pay dividends<br>anything over above or below that that<br>Capital<br>um but quite what that Capital means<br>um I'll leave it to<br>um the bis to explain to the public<br>thank you all right thank you Adrian<br>much appreciated</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
