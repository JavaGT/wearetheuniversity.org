Featuring Adrian Littlewood (former CEO of Auckland Airport), Rob Fyfe (Government liaison with business for Covid response), and Keriana Brooking (Partner at PWC, former CEO of Hawkes Bay DHB).</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>you know obviously<br>um Rob will be with us shortly but I<br>thought I might you know if we frame<br>this up a little bit between the two of<br>you and Rob you all obviously had<br>quite different roles going through the<br>covered experience kiriana you were<br>right in the center of it you were<br>outside for a while and then back in and<br>we might ask you to explain some of that<br>Adrian you were right at the front line<br>in one sense but probably a bit further<br>away from some of you know the the<br>centralized model and then Rob was a<br>bridge between the two so I'll hand over<br>to each of you to just I guess make the<br>the key points you want to for a few<br>minutes and then we'll open it up to the<br>discussion we'll start with you kid<br>again<br>even though I'm sitting the whakatoki is<br>it's on the heels of your feet where you<br>make your stand<br>um and the words of the Carpenters<br>covert sometimes seems long ago and oh<br>so far away<br>um but if we look at the latest figures<br>there are still<br>um around 1300 Active cases of covid in<br>aotearoa today<br>um just want to give you a little bit of<br>context about<br>um the health system at the time and a<br>lot of us you'll be familiar with so<br>2019 through to 2020<br>the health system responded to<br>five Emergency Management responses so<br>there was the Christchurch terrorist<br>attack<br>there was measles there was measles in<br>the Pacific island there was fakari<br>white Island and then there was covert<br>19. so all of those things had massive<br>impacts on a number of people but not<br>all at once and not everywhere in New<br>Zealand<br>I think the second thing is when covert<br>arrived globally<br>um there was so much about the science<br>that was not yet understood<br>and it sweeped globally and was on the<br>doorstep of New Zealand in quite a quick<br>Pace while the science was still being<br>worked through<br>um I worked in the Ministry of Health as<br>a deputy director General<br>um and in uh January of that year we<br>thought we were pretty amazing<br>just getting the people from Wuhan<br>um over to whangaparaoa and finding<br>enough motorhomes for them all to stay<br>in<br>and we kind of said wasn't that a great<br>job and let's be honest that was step<br>1.1.1.8 of what actually eventuated an<br>aotearoa in relation to covert<br>so I was asked by Ashley in February and<br>I remember it distinctly I was leaning<br>up on a wall outside the Emergency<br>Center some of you have heard this story<br>Ashley had gone down to invercargill to<br>watch his sons in the pipe band<br>competition he'd made a last minute<br>decision to go and the only beard he<br>could get was in a Backpackers in a<br>shared room<br>um he decided in that weekend that we<br>needed to really go big or go home on<br>how we were doing the setup for covert<br>and he rang me and asked me if I would<br>be the dce covered and that's the role<br>that I played from February 2020 to July<br>2020 and then I left to become the chief<br>executive of Hawke's Bay District Health<br>Board and so it was really interesting<br>for me I got to see the consequences of<br>decisions made and thought about in the<br>center<br>and the impact of that on a region like<br>Hawkes Bay a place where I still live<br>today<br>um I just want to remind you of some<br>things and they are things that you will<br>know and have probably just tucked into<br>the um back of your mind you know it was<br>late February when we have to 2020 when<br>it we had our first case and then very<br>quickly<br>we were going through as a country that<br>we were asking people to suffer isolate<br>we started closing the borders<br>um we very quickly introduced the levels<br>we went through a whole series of items<br>as a country and we got ourselves<br>through to June 2020 where we thought<br>yeah we're done pretty good<br>we were getting this rolling mole of<br>tinakoto Couture there are no cases in<br>New Zealand today<br>I've likened those 1pm stand-ups to when<br>um I used to ring my mother when<br>Coronation Street was on<br>she used to say coronation streets on<br>and then she'd hang up never rang anyone<br>in New Zealand during those stand-ups<br>and then we thought by 8th of June we've<br>done a not too bad job and then on the<br>11th of August 2024 cases in the<br>community were reported<br>um on the 11th of August uh 2020 is<br>actually the day that I was welcomed to<br>Hawkes Bay District Health Board<br>um we had Ashley in attendance<br>um I'm was the only uh wahine Maori<br>District Health Board chief executive in<br>the 21 years the health boards were in<br>existence so every Maori known to man<br>had turned out to my poor footage we had<br>probably about 400 people there Dr Nick<br>Jones that evening when they announced<br>we were going uh back into a level three<br>rung me in a panic that he thought we'd<br>created a super spreader event but that<br>was not to be<br>um I think the three things I just want<br>to um say in closing is you know what do<br>I reflect on for next time and for us<br>and Hawkes Bay it feels like we are in<br>next time<br>right now<br>um the thing for me about covert in<br>particular the reality of the way new<br>zealanders lived and worked here and<br>overseas was underappreciated or it was<br>an accepted risk<br>that is a consequence of immediate<br>public policy kicking into a gear people<br>got stuck on both sides of the closed<br>door<br>and the school base and the social<br>Fabric and the message the closed door<br>said still reverberates today<br>the second thing is that communities can<br>make it work if they have sufficient<br>resources and good infrastructure<br>and we saw some amazing examples of how<br>communities in covert<br>worked really well together and I think<br>about matakawa at the top of the East<br>Coast they were<br>um you know they<br>they treated the public policy as<br>guidance but they really worked out how<br>to make it work for them<br>we find ourselves at Hawkes Bay working<br>out how we're doing community resilience<br>with the lack of infrastructure<br>that we're experiencing right now so<br>these two kind of elements that have to<br>work in sync and what happens when they<br>get out of sync<br>and then I think the last thing is that<br>um in August 2021 we went back again<br>into alert level four<br>and did we really learn enough<br>between those two years<br>to lessen the blunt of blunt force of<br>public policy on economy and available<br>social license<br>and for those aucklanders in the room<br>and the long uh cold uh spring in summer<br>of 2021 will forever stay in their in<br>their minds and what lessons are<br>commonly agreed now that we don't<br>actually need a royal Commission of<br>inquiry to point them out<br>that would be my final comment tinakai<br>day<br>sure<br>thanks Matt um and endorse a lot of what<br>cariana said I thought I'd just start<br>with a quick quote um and if you excuse<br>the rather clumsy metaphor at the start<br>of this<br>um like hand sanitizer and a paper cut<br>covid-19 exposed the cracks in our<br>health social economic government and<br>political systems virus exacerbated<br>pre-existing vulnerabilities and the<br>pandemic impacted all of us but its<br>burden was not equally shared that's the<br>opening line from the Independent review<br>into Australia's covert response but I<br>think those words are equally relevant<br>to here and I think it is right and<br>proper to both acknowledge what went<br>well uh in the early stage of the<br>pandemic response and carry I touched on<br>that but also recognize there are things<br>that we need to learn for next time and<br>we must do better and I feel really<br>strongly about this I think we owe it to<br>our kids and our grandkids that we must<br>not let these things pass from our<br>memory and they pass very quickly we<br>write them down we learn from them and<br>get them done better next time because<br>this will come again<br>um and and so foreign when I was at<br>Auckland Airport as Matt said we were<br>obviously a private organization but we<br>were at the the front line along with<br>our border agencies and Airlines for the<br>entire period of covert so we had covert<br>in our business every day from day one<br>um so I remember sitting in uh Grant<br>Robinson's office with Kelvin Davis<br>giving them a briefing on what was<br>happening in China in January<br>of 2020<br>and in a cascaded from there Italy Iran<br>shut down China shut down repatriation<br>then into the entire border being shut<br>down so we lived with it every day in<br>our organization and learned to adapt<br>quite quickly and so I think we can all<br>see those early phases of the covert<br>response uh as a period of classic<br>crisis management you know you're<br>dealing with imperfect information<br>you're responding quickly you are trying<br>to Marshal resources and I think those<br>early days we got those things broadly<br>right and there was some scratchy ages<br>around it naturally it's going to happen<br>but I think the thing that really sticks<br>with me looking back on it uh was the<br>sense of stasis that sort of occurred<br>over time<br>I can recount many times being on calls<br>with people in Wellington with<br>politicians with others where<br>my sense of frustration grew over time<br>is this sense of the things we are<br>sharing with you it doesn't feel like<br>you're listening hearing or responding<br>to in a way that is helping us to<br>continue to be better and yes things are<br>always Dynamic and changing but uh when<br>you can see things occurring uh which<br>were known months ago being repeated<br>over and over again and this increasing<br>separation between as Katiana touched on<br>the separation between what was<br>happening in Wellington and what we're<br>seeing around the country particularly<br>in Auckland I think was<br>disheartening at the same time there was<br>a feeling that many of us could help to<br>play a stronger role and it got to the<br>point where that frustration sort of<br>tripped over into a sense of we have to<br>take some of these actions on our own to<br>get things happening<br>um and I can I can reflect on<br>mini exam beer experience and resources<br>that we had that were not easily<br>available to Wellington or found to be<br>very hard for the health establishment<br>or the response to do and I'll just pick<br>up a couple of those examples so<br>um I think the park and ride vaccination<br>site we ended up setting up the largest<br>vaccination site in New Zealand in New<br>Zealand we did that through a bit of<br>bloody mindedness uh as well as some<br>incredible uh Health people on the<br>ground who just decided that they were<br>going to lead it and make it happen<br>um we did that with the door-to-door<br>proposal we gather together experts from<br>New Zealand and Auckland businesses who<br>had experience in going door-to-door<br>with sales experience and Mish targeting<br>around who was most at risk in the<br>community and we offered buses up and we<br>had unique buses and I say buses in the<br>real sense of these uh Park and Ride<br>buses that are specially built for<br>passengers with Luggage So are open and<br>really suited vaccination status and<br>when I rang the health people and said<br>you know why aren't we using the buses<br>and going to Dorado I said well we can't<br>get the buses available because they're<br>all passenger buses but we have six<br>buses and drivers that can be deployed<br>tomorrow and they said oh that's great<br>let's do it and that happened instantly<br>we had it available<br>right down to the rat tests and if you<br>remember back and I'll ask you to<br>remember back to the almost<br>um<br>I really don't understand the difference<br>between what happened on testing but uh<br>on rat testing again through sheer<br>bloody mindedness we gathered together<br>20 odd 30 odd New Zealand companies who<br>just said we will commit to ordering rat<br>test I rang the head of ebos and said<br>can you go and get us a couple hundred<br>thousand reps he said yeah I can have<br>them next week<br>uh but we had to have<br>highly committed people in Wellington uh<br>walk their decision through the<br>Wellington bureaucracy to get that<br>signed off because there was a real<br>resistance to getting those tests into<br>the place and my argument was always we<br>are running a business every day with<br>covert an hour in our business we need<br>to keep our staff safe we need to have<br>tools that are available that aren't<br>relying on a a 24 hour wait for a PCR<br>result<br>and so those are just some small<br>vignettes about where I think<br>um taking a whole of New Zealand<br>response to these kind of crises is<br>really important um you cannot I don't<br>believe manage the scale of a covert or<br>a pandemic like that through the lens of<br>a narrow lens that lens needs to keep<br>widening and and classic crisis Incident<br>Management response tells you and it's<br>in the in the documentation is you must<br>be adaptable flexible and maintain the<br>trust and confidence of the community<br>and I think you can only do that through<br>getting the whole of country response<br>because the government is not the whole<br>of the country<br>uh and and I think those responses uh in<br>the future will be far better and I'm<br>heartened and carry on and I were<br>talking about this in terms of the<br>immediate response to what's happening<br>in the Hawkes Bay is there is I heard an<br>immediate response I say we need to get<br>business involved in response uh and I<br>think that took too long to come about<br>and I'm sure when Rob gets here he'll be<br>able to talk to that given he was at<br>that eight or that intersect between<br>government and business I think it is a<br>critical point for that future<br>sort of thinks Adrian and uh nice segue<br>because over your shoulder uh Rob has<br>arrived so welcoming uh Rob Fife to the<br>stage killer and uh as we know rob you<br>played a critical role Bridging the<br>worlds of government-led response and<br>the business Community we talked a<br>little bit about you know kittiana's<br>background having been in inside<br>Wellington then then outside Adrian<br>really at the front line from January<br>onwards<br>um tell us a little bit about your<br>experience in in your points before we<br>get into the questions which I see some<br>coming through already now<br>uh yeah I kind of look back actually<br>and I got involved<br>ultimately because I was a protagonist<br>outside government making quite a bit of<br>noise back in<br>early March 2020 that I thought the<br>government wasn't moving fast enough<br>um<br>and found myself in a conversation with<br>a number of business people<br>and the Prime Minister<br>um<br>discussing that very issue<br>I kind of got nominated as a<br>spokesperson I think I was the poorest<br>person in the room<br>conversation<br>and at the end of that call their prime<br>minister said well how about one of you<br>come down to Wellington and actors that<br>go between<br>between the government and business as<br>we tackle this challenge<br>and there's Stony silence on the phone<br>call<br>and I guess for me I've always tried to<br>stay pretty clear of government to be<br>honest<br>um<br>I've kind of felt the further removed<br>you are the more you can get on and run<br>your business with minimal interference<br>and I guess interaction<br>so I don't really understand how<br>Wellington worked and in fact<br>two weeks into being down there I spent<br>nine weeks I went down there two days<br>before the first lockdown and spent the<br>lock down in Wellington<br>a couple of weeks into it<br>I rang uh John Key<br>and I see John can you please try and<br>help me understand how you get anything<br>done in this place<br>and we spent about an hour on the phone<br>and after an hour as none the wiser<br>um<br>which probably summed up a lot of my<br>experience actually I relied on people<br>like kiriana to be my navigator at<br>um<br>ambivalent<br>I just positioned those five issues up<br>front because I think they'll stimulate<br>quite a bit of conversation<br>one of the big issues for me<br>degree to which misinformation<br>I mean the number of times I had<br>untrue and accurate and the momentum of<br>which that gathered steam is a pandemic<br>progressed<br>just put me completely off guard<br>and I think you know the number one<br>issue for me as I look to the future if<br>we had another another of these events<br>is that information management and how<br>you build genuine<br>independent trusted sources of the truth<br>it's it's critical to guiding our way<br>through this<br>we ended up with an incredibly<br>centralized decision-making<br>infrastructure everything<br>uh was centralized pretty much into the<br>Ministry of Health in Wellington<br>I think it<br>well that organization grew<br>to be several thousand uh<br>took what was a relatively small<br>small policy shop in the minister of<br>Health<br>and turned it into this All-Seeing all<br>controlling all commanding<br>organization that ran both policy<br>critical decision-making operations<br>and actually in the process became a<br>massive<br>also need for decision making she<br>excluded a lot of people from that<br>decision-making process because it was<br>um<br>I think also and and I heard Adrian<br>touching on it<br>you know because of<br>that centralized decision-making process<br>we ultimately lacked agility<br>we did a tremendous job I think early on<br>I mean covert<br>this is a classic story right had a<br>beginning a middle and an end<br>I think we did the beginning really well<br>we're in the Inn now which is living<br>with covert which was ultimately<br>probably predictable where we would<br>uh where we would end up<br>but the middle the transition between<br>is that better right awesome<br>um and and ultimately through that uh<br>process of lack of agility<br>the virus evolved and we didn't and we<br>became trapped in a strategy that I<br>guess progressively became less and less<br>uh fit for purpose<br>uh two other points I just wanted to<br>um<br>I guess the other uh the other issue and<br>I've experienced this myself being<br>involved in in managing uh crises<br>as we became very very consumed by the<br>the daily operational Vortex of the<br>crisis<br>case numbers this vexing numbers the<br>waitlist and miq everyone right up to<br>the very very highest levels of<br>government was all fixated on the on the<br>daily operational issues<br>and as a consequence<br>the effort that was going into the<br>longer term planning and the strategy<br>and where the off-ramp was out of our<br>elimination strategy and so on uh we<br>probably were<br>allocating far less resource to that<br>forward planning than we were to just<br>and then finally uh you know the point<br>we pride ourselves I think on a nation<br>of as a nation on being very kind of can<br>do<br>uh and I think in covert we became very<br>can't do<br>ultimately and we were constantly<br>finding reasons not to do things our<br>elimination strategy made us inherently<br>very very risk-averse because the idea<br>was we had to trap every possible Vector<br>of the virus coming in to protect the<br>community to maintain this position of<br>elimination<br>that Force us to become so risk-averse<br>as I say everything became a reason why<br>we shouldn't do things rather than<br>looking for ways to get things done<br>so I just sort of position up front they<br>were my kind of five as I looked to the<br>question that was posed this this panel<br>of saying what can we learn for a future<br>such event I think there's a lot of<br>discovery that needs to happen in those<br>five areas where we could do a lot lot<br>better next time around<br>Jordan thanks Rob and thinks I'm seeing<br>some<br>some very interesting questions coming<br>through I'll get to the one on liberal<br>I might start here actually with you rob<br>to keep going one of the big things that<br>came out of that discussion was about<br>evolution of the response can you talk<br>to us about<br>it's just what you touched on in the end<br>how did it evolve or didn't it evolve<br>and for those of us most in this room<br>they were a lot further removed<br>what part of the organization was<br>working on the response rather than in<br>the response was there a constant sense<br>of review of how it was evolving<br>he<br>you know if I look at the various uh<br>layers<br>um there is a lot of pushing from<br>uh outside the Ministry of Health to<br>constantly look at evolving our um our<br>approach<br>and that was coming from the Prime<br>Minister and cabinet it's coming from<br>the business Community it was coming<br>from the Maori community in ewe it was<br>coming from the Pacific Island community<br>we became ultimately<br>and this is my view and as I say this is<br>partly a retrospective it wasn't always<br>visible at the time but<br>we became a prisoner to our elimination<br>strategy what ostensibly happened we<br>were pursuing the strategy we were one<br>of the very few countries in the world<br>that was pursuing that strategy and I<br>think we convinced ourselves that a lot<br>of the learnings internationally<br>went relevant to us because they weren't<br>pursuing the same strategy we were<br>pursuing so it wasn't easy to directly<br>transfer and translate those learnings<br>and those insights I mean rat test was a<br>classic example you know the view was<br>we needed a testing regime that would<br>pick up every single instance of the<br>virus rat tests weren't as accurate<br>therefore they weren't really relevant<br>to an elimination strategy because you<br>couldn't afford any single Vector for<br>the virus to come in so so we shut down<br>a lot of sources of potential Innovation<br>and evolution because we defined our our<br>approach to dealing with the virus is<br>relatively novel therefore we had to<br>develop our own our own insights in our<br>own Solutions so we became very<br>introspective<br>as a country certainly within the<br>ministry in terms of looking at how we<br>could we could adapt and I think<br>ultimately<br>you know that that was a limitation for<br>us you know I look at saliva testing it<br>was proven in an operation kind of 18<br>months before we were allowed to use it<br>in New Zealand and then we hamstrung the<br>capability<br>rat testing was the same a number of the<br>decisions at the border were the same<br>and you know Adrian can talk to that<br>very eloquently<br>uh I I think our mindset became one of<br>you know we have to chart our own path<br>through this and if I look from a<br>business perspective you know all our<br>best Innovations and our learnings<br>always come from looking at what others<br>are doing and trying to import that into<br>our organization and we lost that<br>opportunity somehow in this process yeah<br>great it's a nice bill on that because I<br>think that Devolution point is important<br>but uh that sort of sense of the<br>mortgage on ideas coming from the center<br>was really you know shut up many places<br>but I remember one example where I was<br>briefing a senior a very senior Minister<br>about the work we were doing across<br>actually government and private sector<br>uh led by customs and MIT and so what we<br>were looking at was the future border<br>model uh in a risk-adjusted way<br>reflecting New Zealand's elimination<br>strategy it was sitting in that Minister<br>and given the briefing and saying look<br>we've got a great model here you know<br>cross-government business<br>um<br>and his comment to me was uh yeah we<br>need we need to go and think about that<br>or I need to go and think about that and<br>it really struck me which is when I see<br>something actually you don't need to<br>worry about it give us the problem we'll<br>go and work on it and come back to you<br>as the decision maker uh with a proposal<br>and you can decide but you don't need to<br>work it out so I think that sort of<br>sense of centralization which was<br>accommodation I think of risk and the<br>sort of sense of New Zealand's<br>elimination strategy was so unique that<br>the ideas could only come from One<br>Source I think did limit us and it<br>stopped us sort of dealing in a sensible<br>way for some of the things I think could<br>have been dealt with in the 21 year<br>um that took much longer than it should<br>have to resolve it's really interesting<br>for those if anybody's got a question uh<br>just please raise your hand but do wait<br>for the microphone to come to you just<br>for those on the live stream so if<br>anybody has got a question please please<br>raise and I'll keep going for now<br>um staying with you Adrian because<br>obviously you're at the<br>you're at the front door of New Zealand<br>and so inherently connected to responses<br>all around the world<br>what were you seeing happening on the<br>international scene that you thought we<br>should have learned from earlier or<br>maybe examples where we did and we we<br>did adopt those things well I think Rob<br>touching this testing was was a really<br>obvious one we just and I won't go over<br>there too much again but that was a<br>clear example uh I think there were<br>other issues around risk-based approach<br>to managing the movement of people from<br>different destinations or uh uh origin<br>points<br>and in the sort of sense that there was<br>no other answer than the<br>eliminate and and put through miq and I<br>think<br>um so so there were plenty of examples<br>like that and that that frustrated I<br>think a lot uh and it also had very high<br>personal costs I think uh you know I<br>think we could have and probably know<br>more about this than me but I think we<br>could have moderated or modulated our<br>miq response in a different way based on<br>a more risk-adjusted approach would have<br>which would have lessened the the social<br>cost of some of those measures<br>maturely than it otherwise had<br>um and so I think picking the best as<br>Rob said from around the world and<br>applying it to our local context I think<br>is the right thing to do and it just it<br>was a little bit like wading through<br>treacle to get people to listen to<br>reflect on and sort of say yes that<br>sounds like a great idea let's go and<br>work on it but we're working it by<br>asking the you know the private sector<br>as well as the public sector to work<br>together on what those answers might be<br>that that was felt like a real<br>resistance um<br>jump in there a perfect contrast for me<br>is um in the March 2020 alert level four<br>I left the Ministry of Health building<br>the day we went into lockdown<br>um I had a apartment in Hill Street so<br>two blocks away and I walked and um I<br>was dark there were no cars and there<br>were no other people on the street so I<br>was going up Hill Street and a homeless<br>person popped out of the pathway from<br>the back of parliament onto Hill Street<br>and we both gave each other a fright<br>um because we were the only two people<br>um it felt like in thorndon on the<br>street at that time and she said what's<br>happening<br>and I said what's up she goes what's<br>happening I said we're in lockdown about<br>what<br>and so we had a a wee chat and I said to<br>her have you got somewhere to go tonight<br>she said yeah I'm sorted I'm sorted she<br>said it's a bit weird eh not having<br>anybody around I said yeah that's true<br>that's true uh August the 12th I wake up<br>in Hawke's Bay and I drive myself from<br>Hawke's Bay to Hastings Hospital and we<br>have determined in Hawke's Bay that<br>everybody's an essential worker<br>because we've got so much going on in<br>Hawke's Bay that means our economy needs<br>to thrive that I probably only saw 20<br>less people on the road than I did<br>um than I did the day before<br>so we had worked through what it meant<br>in Hawke's Bay<br>to live within the parameters of a<br>lockdown but make sure that we could<br>still grow grapes and pick apples<br>um it's really interesting Kitty and I'm<br>going to stay with you because really<br>interesting question now from the the<br>health background<br>in retrospect do you think due<br>consideration was given to some of the<br>health trade-offs so obviously there's<br>economic there's there's social but uh<br>impact of delaying elective surgeries<br>treatments impact on mental health and<br>even can you give us a picture into some<br>of those discussions that were happening<br>around us obviously it would have been<br>discussed<br>yeah so I think<br>um<br>it was clear to everybody that there is<br>a Primacy around the public health<br>policy and there was kind of layering<br>within the health policy so Public<br>Health policy what that meant for us<br>through a respond to a public health<br>matter<br>um and then based on a number of the<br>incredibly alarming uh stories we saw in<br>other parts of the world around their<br>health response to people who had<br>covered it was quite<br>um concerning about our ability as a<br>health system to be able to push that<br>many people through Primary Care push<br>that many people through hospitals<br>um and so that was the second layer of<br>if you remember at the start everyone<br>was worried and we still counted how<br>many ventilators we had in New Zealand<br>and how many ICU beds everyone talked<br>about the tip but we really needed to<br>talk about the base<br>um equally as much and there was<br>um there was a and then the next layer<br>then was what were we missing out on and<br>preventative care because equally there<br>were<br>um uh acute sorry there was a planned<br>care that could be down hips and knees<br>but they're a woman who haven't had<br>cervical smears there are children that<br>haven't had immunizations so I get that<br>the plan care is important to<br>um a lot of new zealanders and it<br>affects a lot of whanau but there's a<br>very massive base of preventative health<br>care that also we will spend I think a<br>Generation<br>Um catching up on<br>um what I what I would say<br>um is those things consider were<br>considered but Public Health policy took<br>Primacy<br>um and<br>um if I just speak with my uh former<br>Hawke's Bay District Health Board<br>head-on<br>um and went to 2021 we had a respiratory<br>presentation to Hospital Winter like<br>we'd never seen before<br>um and so it actually wasn't covered<br>that was putting pressure on our<br>hospital we<br>um uh we are a hospital that was built<br>for 90 000 people of Hawkes Bay and we<br>now have 180 000 people we had an<br>emergency department that was built for<br>60 people to be in it and we see 180<br>people a day<br>so the the for for us<br>um we didn't even get to think about<br>covert because there were other things<br>uh that were in front of us so I think<br>that people accepted that there was only<br>so much could be managed through the<br>pipe and we were going to have to live<br>with the consequences of that and I<br>think for everybody in this room they<br>will know that the consequences of that<br>faux completely differently across<br>different demographics of New Zealand<br>and it will be poor people and it will<br>be brown people that will be facing the<br>consequences of that for far longer than<br>the I'll just check no one in the room<br>all right well I've got a lot so we'll<br>keep going the um<br>rob you said something really<br>interesting earlier about Information<br>Management you know people that seemed<br>solid suddenly felt like they'd gone<br>down a conspiracy hole and so on<br>um at different times the covert<br>response was criticized for maybe over<br>managing information and so on what do<br>you think could have been better in that<br>space what what were the gaps what did<br>we get right and and what could have<br>been better because many sectors of the<br>world<br>talk about that as actually one of the<br>strongest parts of the New Zealand<br>response relative to how it played out<br>elsewhere<br>I think this issue falls into the<br>category of this lack of adaptation and<br>Agility I think we did really well on<br>communication early on I think<br>um<br>the Prime Minister and Ashley built real<br>trust and confidence<br>through that probably 2020 period And I<br>mean<br>evidenced by the election result right<br>you know as a population we're very<br>supportive of what the government was<br>doing the direction we were heading in<br>uh<br>I think as soon as we got into the<br>vaccine phase there are a whole bunch of<br>unexpected issues emerged you know we we<br>clearly there's a lot of criticism<br>because the uh vaccine was perceived to<br>be late arriving in New Zealand there<br>are a lot of issues<br>around the process of in the information<br>around the vaccine and so on<br>and we're under pressure to get it<br>rolled out because vaccine was seen as<br>as a critical foundation stone to being<br>able to move to a different state I<br>guess<br>and I think it's when we got into that<br>phase<br>and there started to be a few chinks in<br>the armor and there were certain certain<br>segments of the population that believe<br>the government wasn't being full and<br>Frank or the Prime Minister wasn't or<br>actually wasn't about vaccine and and<br>the consequences of it and<br>the justification for why it seemed to<br>be arriving late and so on and I think<br>it was from that stage onwards that we<br>saw<br>trust start to give away a little bit<br>and with trust is connected to social<br>license and so on and you just sort of<br>saw a few things fraying at the seams<br>and then ultimately I think there was a<br>fatigue element that that set in as well<br>when you got to August 2021 and you had<br>the the Delta outbreak in the Auckland<br>lockdown<br>I think that really started to test<br>people's<br>I I guess commitment again and Trust in<br>the government<br>uh and it all started unraveling pretty<br>quickly looking forward from there<br>so if you go back and say well what<br>would you do differently it's a it's a<br>hard question I mean you know there's<br>clearly no substitute for<br>absolute honesty and and truthfulness<br>and transparency and<br>whilst I don't think there was ever any<br>dishonesty I think you've got to be<br>really careful when you're a<br>communicator that you don't try and<br>become too clever in terms of how you<br>position<br>your arguments and and position your<br>language and I think and this is not<br>directed into any individual but I think<br>collectively<br>there was too much message management<br>rather than thinking how do we get<br>really really precise clear accurate<br>confident sound bites out that people<br>can understand<br>and I think the Spin Doctors<br>progressively got involved in and that<br>started to undermine trust it does make<br>me wonder<br>whether through a process like this you<br>need some<br>independent Authority that sits outside<br>of the decision making that can validate<br>the kind of the the source of the truth<br>if you like that's not politicized<br>that's not involved in the core decision<br>making where they're having to justify<br>their own decisions and so on which you<br>could say is true of the Ministry of<br>Health you look at the Prime Minister<br>ultimately it has to become politicized<br>right through their political lens and I<br>wonder whether you can have an<br>independent Authority that runs<br>alongside and gives people reassurance<br>of of the messaging that is is making<br>its way through because I think this<br>issue is only going to get bigger I mean<br>you look at real time so global social<br>media I mean Tick Tock Trends die they<br>arrive and they die in the space of a<br>couple of days you know it's it's and so<br>we've never we've never experienced a<br>crisis with that level of real-time<br>social media before and certainly not an<br>extended like this pandemic I'm going to<br>put a pin in there I'm going to come<br>back to that notion of the independent<br>side because I think there are some<br>questions here about looking forward<br>preparing I'm just going to check here<br>obviously we're looking at things that<br>maybe were gaps that's appropriate<br>because we're trying to learn also what<br>went well what should we be most proud<br>of what what are the things that we need<br>to ensure that we do<br>again or build upon for the next Crisis<br>spear at a pandemic or something else<br>I was just building on sorry on what Rob<br>said I think if you look around the<br>world I think the the research is<br>starting to suggest those countries that<br>did the best<br>started with strong trust in<br>institutions<br>um and and I think we have that in New<br>Zealand we're probably in a better<br>position than other countries<br>um but I think it has been eroded<br>through what we saw in covert so I think<br>there is a real need to look at our<br>system of government system of<br>Engagement with the community and how we<br>work with Community to make sure those<br>that trust is rebuilt so some of the<br>things that Rob mentioned I think are<br>critical I'd add to that<br>how to get transparency and and trust is<br>contestability of ideas I think there<br>was a sense of<br>closed uh closed<br>that that meant that different ideas<br>were not welcome and information was not<br>open so we we several times over the<br>course of the pandemic<br>asked for access to the models that were<br>guiding decision making<br>the metrics the outcomes and in fact<br>publicly called five chairs of major New<br>Zealand companies call for tell us what<br>you're solving for yet it was not shared<br>and so I think that that lack of<br>contestability or openness to different<br>views I think does erode Trust<br>both with individual citizens but also<br>other organizations that work with<br>government so I think building<br>rebuilding trust and institutions I<br>think will be one of the most important<br>things and then Rod mentioned a few<br>other things a CDC style model you know<br>surveillance for the future I mean there<br>is no question and what we have and I<br>keep saying this for years we have<br>animal biosecurity at the border and<br>have had for decades and we're one of<br>the few countries in the world that<br>already have that so we know how to do<br>this human health security at the border<br>is something we have to have and there<br>are different ways you can do it but it<br>can't be ignorant of the realities of<br>running a border<br>itself so it can't be derived in<br>Wellington and then cooked up and<br>delivered it must be built with Airlines<br>water agencies airports and others so<br>trust institutions I think and looking<br>at the ways that we manage for the<br>future pandemic through building the<br>institutions that we need for the future<br>will be important<br>I actually thought we did in our<br>references earlier I thought we did a<br>really good job of the first phase<br>you know the decisions that we made and<br>you have when you remember back then<br>there was so much we didn't know so<br>we're having to make decisions on very<br>very limited information<br>and I thought we did a really good job<br>through the first phase and it's<br>fascinating<br>um<br>you know kiriana talked about we went<br>into lockdown most of Wellington went<br>home it's amazing how well that place<br>works when there's no one there I mean<br>quite quite seriously that that's right<br>kerryana didn't feed me all these lines<br>just to say because she can't say them<br>but<br>um<br>the reality is you know when when all<br>the bureaucracy was cleared out of the<br>way and there is a very very small<br>number of people making decisions it did<br>actually work really really well<br>and a lot of what we're talking about is<br>when these large kind of bureaucratic<br>monolithic things re-establish<br>themselves and you know the Ministry of<br>Health tenfold the size that it<br>previously had been then of course<br>everything slowed down I mean and it's<br>it's it's<br>just human nature you know if you have<br>10 people in a room trying to make a<br>decision it'll take twice as long as you<br>have five people in the room it probably<br>takes four times as long actually<br>um so one of one of the learnings for me<br>is to say it works so well and we're<br>making really really good decisions when<br>we had a very very limited number of<br>people involved how do you protect that<br>as you move forward and try and<br>constrain the bureaucracy from<br>re-establishing itself and slowing the<br>around the early days with Rob as the<br>rose amongst the Thorns because there<br>was Rob myself Mike Bush Brendan Boyle<br>there was a small group of people in the<br>Operations Command Center who met every<br>day<br>um and I came and um it was a translator<br>um in a navigator<br>of what was going on in the in the<br>ministry and we would land<br>sensible forward movement<br>um in a way that really really made<br>sense I mean I think for me uh the<br>um the things that went well and then<br>I'm not sure if we adapted as well as we<br>could<br>um at some stage we needed to convert<br>the Sim structure the Emergency<br>Management approach response to what<br>happens when the response lasts two<br>years and and and how do you evolve that<br>because a lot of that was quite well<br>understood and well protected but as Bob<br>says as you add more layers and people<br>um you really get the you really lose I<br>suppose the ability to make decisions as<br>quickly as you can<br>um<br>uh AJ and I were talking before this<br>about the um the appointment of a public<br>sector private sector task force to<br>manage their<br>um Cyclone Gabriel<br>um response from the start I think has<br>also<br>um a lesson well learned<br>um and I think that's that's good and<br>that's a lesson that is<br>um folding into each um a region<br>um you know when I talk about Hawke's<br>Bay we've got<br>um uh four District councils we've got a<br>Regional Council we've got 14 post<br>treaty sentiment groups we've got large<br>primary industry it's the beauty of<br>democracy and the games of thrones all<br>at the same time and so you've got to be<br>able to make sure that everybody is<br>there because these are Big tasks to<br>tackle<br>um so I think that is something we need<br>to<br>um we need to work on I think the the<br>last thing which I think was a beautiful<br>thing and again I'll use the Hawkes Bay<br>example<br>um our Maori providers in our taiphenua<br>were the lead for the whole population<br>for our care in the community<br>uh and for our vaccination program<br>um and um you know in Hawke's Bay we can<br>be a little bit Plymouth Rock<br>um and sometimes there are people who<br>would have not even have known that<br>Maori providers existed<br>um and yet everybody's experience was as<br>positive as it could be and I think it<br>was a real measure of what's good for<br>Maori is good for everybody<br>um and uh covert allowed that<br>opportunity to shine and so I think<br>that's an increased incredibly positive<br>thing that came out of our experience of<br>the tale of covert thank you and I'm<br>just got a question from the floor here<br>and we've got about six minutes or so<br>and then we'll go into close please<br>Pagani here great discussion guys thank<br>you I just want to ask what do you think<br>do you have any confidence that the<br>Royal commission will address any of the<br>uh<br>uh that's an interesting question I'm<br>really hopeful that it does<br>um I think the Royal commission is<br>critical I mean you look<br>so much of our response was developed on<br>the fly it wasn't predetermined and<br>already you know the key leaders that<br>have all that learning in their in their<br>heads actually has gone to a different<br>role the prime ministers no longer in<br>her role<br>none of the three of us are in our roles<br>you know the world moves on really<br>really quickly so I think the Royal<br>commission is critical<br>to capture the learnings I I think the<br>chair of that commission coming from<br>offshore will be a really good<br>perspective from the outside<br>um in so I think that Independence is<br>really valuable and I think it's<br>absolutely critical we did get some<br>things uh right you know and it's the<br>nature of the session kind is designed<br>to look for improvement opportunities we<br>got a lot right but there's a lot we<br>could do so much better and I think<br>actually next time around it'll be even<br>tougher I mean this this misinformation<br>issue I think is you know one of the<br>biggest issues facing our generation is<br>and is going to keep growing<br>I'd certainly like to see the terms of<br>reference broadened I think they are too<br>narrow and I think when you've got a an<br>event like this it affects almost all<br>parts of our country<br>Society culture economy so I think it's<br>it's too narrow so I I'd like to hope<br>maybe a new prime minister might be<br>willing to open that up a little bit<br>more<br>um I also and this is not a comment on<br>Tony Blakely but I would have preferred<br>someone a bit more distant from the New<br>Zealand response cheering it I think<br>it's a little bit too close to home you<br>know we engage with Tony and a few<br>things throughout the pandemic response<br>from our point of view and I know he was<br>involved in other things so I I think<br>distant sort of reflection on what we<br>did pick up both the good and the things<br>that we work on would be great but it is<br>what it is but a broader reference I<br>think would be great<br>I think the broader reference will<br>potentially get Force because as soon as<br>you open the lines of inquiry people<br>bring whatever it is that they want to<br>bring to the table<br>and as a former public server server and<br>all right I'm going to go to the closing<br>question this is uh uh the goal of<br>learning so one that's come through<br>if you were designing a pandemic<br>response agency what personnel do you<br>think it's broader and management need<br>how do we set ourselves up better for<br>the next one and we'll just go a quick<br>fire through the team<br>um I think it needs to be probably a<br>little bit more United Colors of benefit<br>which is my point about we need to be<br>making sure that we've we've got private<br>we've got public we've got people that<br>really understand responses we've got<br>we've got Maori and that we think about<br>that purposefully from the start<br>um and not make it look like it's<br>something we thought about later or were<br>pushed we're pushed to think about after<br>we went live<br>thank you I'd simply like to apply the<br>standard crosses management response and<br>it's been touched on by both these guys<br>as well which is in the way we ran at<br>the airport I'm sure the same in New<br>Zealand which is you have your immediate<br>response team you have your recovery<br>team who look ahead to how do we get out<br>the back of this and then you have your<br>strategy team who look very long term<br>and all of those have to operate at the<br>same time and then<br>in doing so you then draw on the whole<br>of the country all the expertise all the<br>knowledge and are open and agile and how<br>you respond I think that would yeah and<br>that's an evolution of what we did do<br>but I think that would help make the<br>next time better<br>and we write it down we must write down<br>what we learned thank you<br>there's a couple of key principles for<br>me around how you go about designing a<br>future pandemic response the first is<br>that all your best knowledge is always<br>out on the front lines right so you have<br>to figure out how you can have<br>distributed access to new insights that<br>are occurring whether that's from<br>business as a say different Community<br>groups from Maori and so on so<br>having those insights able to be<br>absorbed by the decision makers<br>absolutely key number one<br>second for me as as open-mindedness you<br>know one of the fascinating things about<br>this pandemic things that I believed<br>a month then were often proven to be no<br>longer true three months in or six<br>months in you have to be able to walk<br>away from absolute truths that you<br>believe and accept new realities as they<br>emerge it's it's really easy to get<br>trapped into a mindset of Defending a<br>previously held belief when it's no<br>longer true and I think that was really<br>evident so you need a principle of<br>open-mindedness you need a principle of<br>being able to access and Source insights<br>globally from the best practice we had<br>countries that were experiencing things<br>well ahead of us because they were<br>pursuing different strategies and we<br>went uh adapting adapting their<br>learnings and then the third piece of me<br>so as I say you need this<br>Independence<br>in to be able to build confidence and<br>what is the the truth transparency and<br>honesty as you move and so I think the<br>CDC and uh<br>and and the leadership there was a<br>global role model that we could we could<br>learn from and we could adapt here as<br>well<br>thank you look we're at times so I'll<br>call it for this session uh there are a<br>lot of questions that came through that<br>we didn't get to that's the uh those<br>happen in the foyer some of them are<br>probably best expressed on a smaller<br>stage as well<br>um but kittiana Adrian Rob thank you so<br>much for this I know that uh covert for<br>some as you said seems a long time ago<br>but we are still living with so many of<br>the other impacts and we don't know what<br>is around the corner and some of these<br>things in fact we're right right in the<br>middle of when we brought in the<br>definition of the responses we need so<br>we all really appreciate it and we'll<br>put our hands together thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
