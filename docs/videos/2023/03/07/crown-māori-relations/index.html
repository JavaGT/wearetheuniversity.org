School).</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we've got a fantastic panel with us here<br>today first we have Christopher<br>Finlayson<br>returns to his career in law now but we<br>all probably know him a little better as<br>former Attorney General and minister of<br>Treaty of waitangi negotiations we have<br>parakafia McLean chair for whakati Tenga<br>or waikato CEO of the criminal cases<br>review commission and somebody who in a<br>variety of roles you'll see in the<br>biography in your book has been an<br>active participant and leader within<br>Crown Maori relations in in different<br>capacities for many years we also have<br>Jason Mika Jason is an associate<br>professor of Maori business here at Taro<br>Papa waikato management school and<br>really a leading thinker on the<br>intersection between tiamari and the<br>commercial and business world and and a<br>leader in the research space for that as<br>well so very much looking forward to<br>this question I'll ask each of you to<br>make some opening comments three to five<br>minutes otherwise that that cough that<br>conspicuous cough will be your warning<br>and then we'll open up to questions<br>please from the floor and on slido and<br>let's get into it so I might ask for you<br>oh on on here I'll come down<br>um Christopher please you're up there<br>and as I acknowledge you intellectual<br>and Civic leaders what I've said also as<br>I acknowledge those who have passed and<br>I particularly want to mention two of my<br>former colleagues Chester borrows whom<br>we buried yesterday<br>with the the love the aroha of Nati<br>ruanui and naruahine and also one of my<br>predecessors as attorney general Paul<br>East who died after a very long and<br>courageous struggle with Parkinson's and<br>I know Jim bulges here and he'd want me<br>to say that as well can I also<br>acknowledge tainui<br>the great eweed not only of waikato as<br>some people think but also all the way<br>through to Tamaki and of course one of<br>the Kings used to have his Summer Palace<br>on the grounds of what is now the<br>Auckland War Memorial Museum and there<br>are some interesting discussions that<br>will go on about boundaries as between<br>Nadi fatua and waikato tainui and I very<br>much look forward to observing those<br>having been the minister dealing with<br>them for many years can I tell you a<br>story a couple of weeks ago<br>the wife of the United States Ambassador<br>here asked me a question she said you<br>know the stuff about co-governance are<br>you talking about treaty-based<br>Partnerships<br>and I said well yes I am and she said<br>I'll send you some material and she sent<br>me some stuff about<br>an area of 1.3 million acres in southern<br>Utah called the beers ears Monument<br>and it was set aside by President Obama<br>the great toxic narcissist of Mar-A-Lago<br>reduced it to about five acres and then<br>President Biden extended it back out to<br>1.3 million acres and it is co-managed<br>by the United States Bureau of Land<br>Management and five First Nations groups<br>including the Navajo and the Pueblo<br>and it's one of a number of examples in<br>the United States of treaty-based<br>co-management and that's what we're<br>talking about or I have to I'm talking<br>about and I worked with Stephen Joyce<br>and others on when I was in government<br>from 2008 2017.<br>uh now that he's passed away I can<br>probably blame Michael Cullen for<br>introducing the term co-governance which<br>has developed a life of its own because<br>some people are conflating co-governance<br>and co-government but that's not what<br>it's about<br>it was about treaty-based<br>co-management of Natural Resources<br>normally reached but not always through<br>treaty settlements<br>and the first one I had to deal with was<br>over the Great waikato River after I<br>became the minister and I worked with<br>Tarawa and tufaritoa and the and<br>natimaniapoto bring the waipar into that<br>Arrangement and that has been very<br>successful and I acknowledge the late<br>John Luxton who worked with Tucker<br>Morgan on that as co-chairs and there<br>have been other examples that I<br>introduced when I was a minister for<br>Treaty of waitangi negotiations so<br>that's the Genesis of<br>treaty-based co-management expunge<br>co-governance from your Lexicon because<br>it's confusing and mischievous talk<br>about treaty-based co-management of<br>natural resources and there you have<br>something which I believe is extremely<br>positive<br>and good for the country<br>and there's nothing new Under the Sun so<br>I'll leave it there I'm tempted to say<br>if you want further material on the<br>background you should uh this sounds<br>awfully arrogant but I'll say it anyway<br>go to my book<br>um<br>and the other thing you may do if you<br>can't be bothered helping me with<br>royalties is go to The Listener of a<br>couple of weeks ago where there is an<br>article by me on that now there's going<br>to be debate about article 3 and<br>co-governance maybe we could explore<br>and look I just had to bring<br>Christopher's book along<br>given we were talking about this very<br>important<br>but really it is an honor to be here<br>alongside both Christopher and um<br>uh Jason today this is a Culpepper that<br>is dear to my heart Crown Mighty<br>relations and<br>um like Christopher I'm going to share<br>with you a personal story I've also<br>brought along notes because my day roll<br>is as a CEO of a crown entity and given<br>the events of the week I need to be very<br>careful about what I say given the media<br>here and others as well so look it is a<br>privilege I've had the privilege of<br>almost 12 years being in a leadership<br>role with waikato's autonary and so I'm<br>going to share some of the insights and<br>experiences that I've had before I talk<br>about the co-governance co-managements<br>arrangements however from the waikato<br>river settlement it is really important<br>first to acknowledge that 28 years ago<br>in 1995 through the leadership of the<br>and we have in the presence the prime<br>minister at that time tar surgeon Bulger<br>here who signed our ropatu land<br>settlement<br>I was in the states at that time but my<br>parents were present at turangaway Marae<br>and if you imagine in those days we<br>didn't have the opportunity your ability<br>to text to Instagram or to Facebook or<br>Tick Tock uh real-time action instead my<br>mother wrote a beautiful letter<br>describing in detail that day<br>and described what really resonated with<br>me was the reason why here and Dad<br>supported the Mahi at that time of the<br>late Sir Robert mahuta and the<br>settlement and that was despite<br>the her cousin the very ferocious and<br>formidable<br>um Eva Rickard and her whanau protesting<br>outside tudong Huawei that day and what<br>she said in her letter to me was that<br>to<br>really have the opportunity to determine<br>for ourselves our future<br>and so she was very much about<br>supporting and building the prosperity<br>of our ewe<br>um I have that little store and whenever<br>I read it I'm very emotional about it I<br>was emotional at the time because I<br>wasn't back here in aotearoa New Zealand<br>and I'm emotional about it now because<br>both my parents have now passed on and<br>it is one of the reasons I guess one of<br>the drivers for me personally as to why<br>I involve myself in the day-to-day lives<br>in the leadership of our ewe there are<br>two other points that I wanted to make<br>about that particular settlement that<br>opatu settlement the first is around the<br>statement that or the our narrative from<br>waikato<br>as land was taken at that time so it<br>should be returned the other point<br>within the Preamble of that act and that<br>settlement refers to this being a<br>process of healing and the new age of<br>cooperation between the crown<br>the kingitunga in waikato and that's a<br>nice segue into our second historical<br>settlement and that of the waikato river<br>claim and Christopher is correct when he<br>draws on and the references of<br>co-management within our settlement<br>however from an ewe perspective from a<br>waikato perspective what is also is a<br>what is also important uh some of the<br>kupu and the references to te Mana or<br>tawa The Prestige<br>of the river the river is a tupuna we<br>consider her to be our ancestor<br>Heidi which is referencing The Authority<br>not just waikato but the other River ewe<br>have in terms of the management and<br>access to the river and her resources<br>and the final point is really fine which<br>is a reference to the vision and<br>strategy of our settlement which is all<br>about<br>uh restoring and protecting the health<br>and well-being of the waikato river for<br>future generations and that is something<br>that is an interest to many others not<br>just to the ewe so when I was appointed<br>the CEO of waikato's autonomy in 2010<br>one of my accountabilities was to work<br>with a diverse group of organizations<br>central government local authorities<br>many other stakeholder and interest<br>groups to how do we give effect to that<br>vision and strategy and it's embodied<br>very much in the waikato river Authority<br>that Christopher has mentioned which was<br>co-chaired at the Time by The Honorable<br>John Luxton and tuku Morgan my fellow<br>tribal leader<br>recently I read a news Hub seats at the<br>table series around co-governance and<br>they describe the arrangement with the<br>waikato river Authority as shockingly<br>time no assets have been stolen these no<br>powers have been grabbed it's a bunch of<br>people sitting around a board table<br>doing board stuff<br>and making decisions and sharing the<br>accountability for financing and<br>outcomes probably the distinguishing<br>feature however is that they're doing it<br>on the consensus basis<br>so they keep talking it through until<br>they reach a consensus<br>um I think I'm going to leave it there I<br>will make some other comments throughout<br>this discussion I do want to share<br>another story though when I I had a<br>meeting with the CEO who will remain<br>anonymous who seriously thought that<br>co-management meant having a cup of tea<br>with me<br>every six months uh he got the message<br>very quickly because we never ever had a<br>cup of tea again<br>instead that was replaced with a<br>decision-making committee with equal<br>numbers of counselors representing our<br>communities central government officials<br>and of course waikato River ewe leaders<br>so from a wakot's autonomy perspective<br>the relationships that we've forged over<br>time will continue to endure and the<br>benefits gained from this Arrangement<br>are for current and future generations<br>to enjoy I want to leave this with a<br>comment from my fellow tribal leader<br>tuku Morgan and I'm going to be much<br>more diplomatic he's much more harder<br>hitting in straight to the point but he<br>also says what is good for waikato is<br>good for the region and great for our<br>nation<br>thank you<br>Jason<br>um<br>foreign<br>to be here in the company of greatness I<br>think we've got uh former Minister here<br>he's had a lot to do with my iwi<br>who settled with uh with the crown on<br>the 3D settlements some years ago and<br>also parikhafia when I was a policy<br>analyst and tapune cookery in the 1990s<br>parikhafia was at the department of<br>prime minister and cabinet that we used<br>to look up to parikhafia I used to take<br>advice from parikhafia when I was<br>writing our cabinet papers and whatnot<br>so I had a lot of fun in those days but<br>um my cope upper Now is really all about<br>supporting indigenous Economic<br>Development and Entrepreneurship so<br>Dakota around co-governance and this<br>forum the suspicious occasion is really<br>how can we Foster and grow Maori<br>Economic Development Maori Enterprise<br>development through whatever it is we we<br>are talking about today<br>and so on the cope up of co-governance I<br>guess I've got five points to make in my<br>two minutes probably now the first one<br>is that when we're thinking about<br>co-governance and co-management and<br>co-editing we have a model<br>a model to follow and it's to tell it to<br>your weight than the Treaty of waitangi<br>and so if we're unsure about what<br>co-governance actually looks like you<br>know read the Treaty of waitangi just<br>read the document read whatever our<br>ancestors<br>ancestors wrote there and why they wrote<br>it and what it means for us today<br>and it's about partnership it's about<br>working together it's about including<br>each other's views each other's<br>knowledges each other's aspirations and<br>what is best for our nation for our<br>country<br>and inside that uh that treaty there's a<br>kaupapa called uh<br>is all about tribal autonomy<br>is about the tribe deciding what is best<br>for its people<br>and their fenua their lands their Waters<br>not just for themselves but for all of<br>us<br>all of us and El iwi it's called papa is<br>nothing else<br>why is that important<br>Because unless we decide what's<br>important and what is best then someone<br>else would decide for us<br>so co-governance starts with<br>acknowledging<br>the treaty partner coming together to<br>offer the best not just for Maori but<br>so the other thing that I wanted to say<br>as examples where does this happen and I<br>was going to talk about tuhi but<br>Christopher reminded me<br>you know tuhui governments is actually<br>you know it's not co-governance it's<br>it's still hori governance so we can<br>park that one<br>um uh what I wanted to talk about is two<br>examples one is called a group that you<br>by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and trade<br>and Maori who have an interest in trade<br>around the time that New Zealand hosted<br>epic 2021<br>it was a partnership body co-governance<br>Institute you know co-governance<br>organization although Jane Kelsey<br>counseled me and she said don't call it<br>co-governance it's a structure of<br>partnership Jason okay go to Jane thank<br>you and uh and I was also counseled by<br>uh Pizza tip and here anyone know Pizza<br>Tiffany very formidable man and<br>Jane and uh and pitcher and Moana and<br>others who are involved in that group<br>and also to tomata very clearly said<br>that<br>you know it's treaty partnership<br>we have our contribution to make and the<br>government has its contribution to make<br>to achieve best outcomes from apic 2021<br>and if you want to look at what<br>co-governance looks like read the<br>principles of that agreement they took<br>six months to negotiate so a lot of uh<br>tough conversations<br>you can imagine with pizza you know it's<br>going to hold the line so that's an<br>example for us to look at as to<br>co-governance and how it influences<br>policy the other one that again we may<br>not have heard of but some of you may be<br>participating in it either you know or<br>you don't know but it is our churches<br>you take any church in this country and<br>you look at the structure<br>the way in which they operate and they<br>have uh you know they have their Maori<br>Synod they have their pancakes in it<br>they've got Fijian tolerance in it<br>whether it's the methodists the<br>Catholics anglicans Presbyterians they<br>all acknowledge tertility await them<br>they acknowledge matauranga Maori they<br>acknowledge Maori<br>and their ways of being as part of the<br>church structure the way that they make<br>decisions said policy provide for their<br>churches look after assets together<br>may not always be harmonious<br>you know but they have an example for us<br>to look at<br>and then the the other thing that I just<br>wanted to say briefly<br>tribal autonomy and and these sorts of<br>things it's evidence-based it works<br>it's not just evidence<br>you go to Harvard<br>they've been studying this for 30 years<br>self-determination for tribal peoples<br>results in the best possible outcomes<br>better than any government Department<br>could produce better than any other<br>private Corporation<br>so it works so when you hand and you<br>acknowledge<br>self-determination of tribal peoples<br>best possible economic outcomes result<br>so in short<br>basically if we want uh Economic<br>Development among tribal people among<br>Maori whether that's entrepreneurs or<br>businesses what we need to be talking<br>about is how do we give effective<br>how do we grab it and support it and<br>enable it because the best possible<br>outcomes result from it and we get a<br>treaty partner who is geared up and<br>ready to do business and to make the<br>best possible decisions for our people<br>Jason<br>fantastic openings all three so thank<br>you all right I'm going to dive into<br>there are a lot of questions have come<br>through here from the audience and will<br>give an opportunity directly as well I'm<br>going to start on co-governance I won't<br>stay only on co-governance this is a<br>broader discussion but uh Christopher<br>your article and The Listener recently I<br>can wholeheartedly recommend that to the<br>uh to the group here you talked about<br>co-management and I think you've just<br>told us to expunge the governance term<br>from this and we've applied it very<br>clearly there to co-management of<br>resources we have examples the waikato<br>river and so on can you explain to us<br>how that might work or whether it should<br>work in your view across areas that are<br>not natural resource based because I<br>think in the last uh six to 12 months<br>some of the reasons that co-governance<br>has become a flash point in discussions<br>have been about understandings or<br>misunderstandings around application<br>through broader areas of policy sure<br>well in my experience let me take you to<br>my time as Minister for arts and culture<br>because I was dealing with a number of<br>bodies<br>for example what was once known as the<br>historic places trust it's now Heritage<br>New Zealand and also the Arts Council<br>and there were on within the structure<br>of those organizations there were<br>particular Maori bodies so for example<br>for years we've had the Maori Heritage<br>Council as part of what is now Heritage<br>New Zealand and with the Arts Council<br>since Doug Graham's reforms in the early<br>1990s<br>when creative New Zealand was was born<br>we've had to walk a toy so these sorts<br>of bodies are not unknown the whether or<br>not they are co-governance I don't think<br>they are but there are specific bodies<br>within organizations what you are asking<br>is the extent to which this principle of<br>that I outlined in relation to Natural<br>Resources<br>should also be applied in other areas of<br>government Administration and that's<br>where there is a debate and it will come<br>as no surprise to you I inclined to the<br>views of Mr luxon who said that<br>co-governance as a means by which<br>service can be provided in all instances<br>may not be the right approach that what<br>we need to do is focus heavily on<br>provide ensuring that there are top<br>quality services which<br>are available for everyone but that's<br>the area of contemporary debate and<br>we're in an election season where<br>presumably some of those themes will<br>emerge I think the real problem in all<br>this has come from the and I I don't<br>think there's some kind of jesuitical<br>plan out there but I I think an<br>inability to articulate what<br>co-governance<br>means<br>beyond what I've been talking about and<br>into the more article 3 issues<br>thank you I might go to parakathia and<br>very genuinely feel free to pass on<br>questions I'm conscious of your uh your<br>your mandate as a as a leader within the<br>public sector as well so<br>building on what Christopher's just said<br>can you talk to us what's your take on<br>the applications of co-management<br>co-governance the incorporation of tell<br>Maori and the crown into delivery of<br>other services we've obviously you look<br>at education<br>could a cope up a very long-term model<br>health is a big topic now how do you see<br>that working and how do you believe that<br>should work<br>yeah look that's a really important<br>question and um<br>I'll tell you what is not co-governance<br>maybe if I start there and I'll use the<br>whole order reforms as an example<br>um the mighty health authority<br>is not I believe a representation of<br>co-governance and why I say that if<br>if I look at the waikato river Authority<br>where you have equal membership of crown<br>appointments appointees and River ewe<br>appointees as well as and there's a mix<br>on the crown side you've got local<br>government leaders and so on the Maori<br>health authority<br>they were appointed by ministers under<br>the pay order Act<br>they are a statutory entity<br>similarly as tifati water so I think<br>it's really important to make that's<br>that really clear that because that that<br>keeps coming up I think in that public<br>debate what is co-governance from a a<br>social policy perspective so certainly<br>in my view anyway the Maori health<br>authority is not a co-governance<br>Arrangement the question however is how<br>do you improve or how do you address the<br>what is the mechanism to address Health<br>inequities for significant population<br>our Maori communities and Pacific<br>peoples you look at the evidence you<br>look at it the epidemiological evidence<br>and you know it's been like this for the<br>six a number of generations<br>that is a response there's one response<br>that has come out of the pay order<br>legislation but it's not the only<br>response<br>if I think about the response to covert<br>the real change happened on the ground<br>in terms of vaccination with<br>the many providers including hoariam<br>Maori providers Pacific providers our<br>phos mainstream providers we're joined<br>up together and responded really I<br>believe<br>um<br>in some cases they didn't need to be<br>told by Wellington in fact that's the<br>thing you don't need to be given a<br>mandate from Wellington to know what you<br>need to do in the case of covert people<br>got out there and did what they had to<br>do pulled together to respond so that's<br>sort of that's my opening comment there<br>around<br>co-governance and Arrangements like that<br>thank you for social policy I'm going to<br>go into a question here that's come<br>through and it's one that um<br>if you if you if you if you stray on<br>your radio dial when you're driving into<br>the world of TalkBack radio this is the<br>one where you'll get people really<br>diving in and so on so but I'm really<br>interested in your views as thought<br>leaders in this space are there<br>circumstances where<br>people who are Maori should have<br>different decision-making rights based<br>on Anderson Street when it comes to<br>provision of Public Services<br>if you're thinking about<br>you know when when organizations<br>institutions<br>want to incorporate<br>in what they do whether that's a<br>university<br>or a health Ministry or a business a<br>large firm that deals with and works<br>with Maori<br>a lot of organizations now are sort of<br>saying well how do we incorporate<br>into our organization and what it is we<br>do so we get better outcomes for people<br>whether that's health or education or<br>anything else<br>the the problem you strike in that<br>situation is who is the treaty partner<br>and how do we recognize them who do we<br>talk to<br>who as the treating partner<br>for instance if an organization like a<br>university I won't pick on this one<br>because I work for this one now I pick<br>on the one I used to work for<br>now if a university says we want to be<br>utility-led we want to incorporate<br>tutility or waitangi and everything we<br>do that's wonderful<br>who is the treaty partner you've got a<br>vice Chancellor you've got a council<br>they have all the money<br>and the managers have all the money the<br>resources the delegation and so when you<br>want to incorporate fertility or<br>waitangi in any organization who do we<br>talk to do you talk to your Maori staff<br>do you talk to manafinua on who's fenua<br>these organizations these businesses are<br>based Do You Talk to an Advisory Group<br>set up alongside a council<br>and ask them are you the treaty pattern<br>should I be talking to you<br>so when we talk about well who is the<br>treaty partner yes whakapapa does matter<br> up what what that says is who you<br>are where you come from<br>where are your people buried<br>where were you brought up who do you<br> up atsu so yes Anne's history is<br>really important when it comes to my<br>right to speak my right to stand my<br>right to express my view on what is best<br>for our people and not just for Maori<br>again for all of us<br>so that's all I have to say on that<br>Kilda thank you Jason<br>yep I'm going to respond to this<br>um I and I acknowledge the comments that<br>if you are listening to radio all the<br>time<br>um I don't buy into that<br>um argument about uh it's based on<br>Ancestry at all I think policy<br>intervention must be led by evidence and<br>there's very clear evidence around<br>inequity in aotearo New Zealand and the<br>impact that has had particularly on our<br>Maori population and Pacifica people and<br>younger our younger generation too so<br>it's purely from a policy perspective<br>and intervening on improving outcomes<br>for<br>whanau for households for businesses<br>well I mentioned to wakatoi because if<br>Circa theater or Fortune theater can't<br>apply for funding to wakatoi it's Maori<br>for Maori and so we've had these sorts<br>of bodies before the issue for debate is<br>the extent to which those sorts of<br>principles should apply to other areas<br>of government Administration and that's<br>where the debate is at the moment but do<br>not believe that these things have never<br>happened before because they have<br>thank you I'm going to pick up on a<br>point you raised in your response there<br>Jason and take it in a different<br>direction about who is the the treaty<br>party partner in this discussion the<br>title is Crown Modi relations<br>um just looking to the crown side<br>the<br>how do we reconcile the the bicultural<br>system that's inherent in their name and<br>some of these discussions with a society<br>that's visibly and obviously<br>Multicultural where people have come<br>from many different Corners over many<br>different times and may feel an<br>affiliation with the crown or may not<br>for other for other reasons do you want<br>to unpack a little bit of how we might<br>reconcile those two<br>yes uh I guess the question of are we a<br>bicultural nation or a multicultural<br>Nation does come up<br>um my view on that is that we're both<br>We're a bicultural nation in terms of<br>how we were founded it wasn't uh France<br>who were you know our ancestors were<br>doing a deal with uh it was it was<br>England and uh and and Queen Victoria<br>and and so forth and what we have<br>um from that occasion uh from tutility<br>or waitangi is a you know a coming<br>together of two cultures of two peoples<br>of two Sovereign Nations who wanted to<br>engage uh in what the future would of<br>alteoda would look like so in that sense<br>We're a bicultural nation but we also<br>Multicultural demographics tells you<br>that you know I've got Tongan and Maori<br>kids so you know there's a lot of uh you<br>know our whanau out here that sort of<br>tell us that look you know we're from<br>all over the world and we need to<br>acknowledge that and under the utility<br>of waiting there's a place for everyone<br>you know when you think about the<br>purpose of tutility or waitangi it was a<br>uh and to look after them now Maori had<br>a big sense of responsibility whenever<br>someone comes to a Maori home<br>you monarchy that person that visitor so<br>when people are coming to aotearo you<br>monarchy them you have a responsibility<br>for their well-being and you do it to<br>the very best of your ability<br>not minimal you don't give them a ginger<br>nut cookie you put the pot on and you<br>make sure they're well fit and they're<br>so full they don't want to leave but you<br>know you've got to say you know kindly<br>please you know I gotta gotta get back<br>to my job<br>so look you know<br>um<br>we're both we're both and I'm you know<br>so pleased that to say that we are both<br>uh have we got some things to work out<br>yeah we've got a few things to work out<br>and how we work together which is the<br>quarter for for our our day today<br>anybody else like to comment on that<br>oh here we go<br>I'm going to look out are there any<br>questions from yes can we get a<br>microphone to Josie<br>thank you for such a stimulating<br>conversation<br>um so uh I wondered you mentioned about<br>um<br>the Maori health authority it seems to<br>me like that's a real centralized model<br>it's it's another kind of big<br>centralized model just changing you know<br>making giving it a Maori name<br>um and then I look at the Kura model and<br>I think well Kuroko papa is is<br>Devolution so I I wonder if our whole<br>debate around co-governance is kind of<br>moved us away from a debate around<br>Devolution which feels far more<br>substantive and radical to me in terms<br>of devolution of resources and decision<br>making so which is it which which one<br>should we be going for<br>I think if you ask this question<br>um and put this apartheid to the late<br>Sir Robert mahute in fact he said it he<br>was an advocate for devolving resources<br>decision making fully to the treaty<br>partner to ewe clearly that's not where<br>we're at we're in a an environment and a<br>time as we should be and picking up on<br>the comedy that Jason made That We're a<br>nation that allows for all<br>and so we have a variety of Institutions<br>I think that's a I think that's an<br>excellent question and one of the great<br>debates that we're going to have this<br>year is whether the central Centra<br>petal tendency of this government is a<br>good thing or a bad thing I'm a<br>centrifugalist I'm a great believer in<br>Devolution because having been a<br>minister for nine years I believe the<br>institutional state<br>simply cannot do what is necessary and<br>as a matter of principle you devolve so<br>much as is possible to local communities<br>because you will achieve better outcomes<br>that's some people would say that's<br>reaganism I would say it's good solid<br>Common Sense the central government<br>there is a belief in Wellington and it's<br>a genuine belief and I'm sure it's a<br>noble belief but it's a crazy belief<br>that the state can through Wellington<br>can solve problems it can't The<br>Institute and and I know for that that<br>you know when poto Williams recently<br>said that Kelvin had said to her that<br>good luck sister everyone hates Doc and<br>that you apply that across the board<br>because the institutional State doesn't<br>understand ewe<br>um<br>I'm going to stay with you for a moment<br>Christopher there's a question come<br>through specifically<br>to you in your time as as Minister uh<br>more than 50 treaty settlements where to<br>next for the treaty settlement process<br>and then of interested in other views<br>well<br>um thank you for asking that question<br>whoever it was<br>um it wasn't 50 it was 60. and<br>I was recently at something where<br>someone said oh well you know we're on<br>to the uh we're on to the difficult<br>settlements now as if tuhui was a sort<br>of a jog in the park<br>um so I think that's a way of<br>rationalizing the citation Pace that<br>we've had in the last little period so I<br>think that there will be a period where<br>uh hopeful and hopefully final<br>settlements will be achieved I make no<br>apologies for the fact that I<br>um was very keen to see treaty<br>settlements if you want a good read the<br>Taylor Diagon and Barry report on ewe<br>achievement obviously waikato tainui is<br>an outstanding success but one that I<br>need to mention to you is natitoa with<br>whom Stephen and I settled in the early<br>2010s and we settled for about 90<br>million dollars and the TDP report says<br>they're worth about 800 million now a<br>bit of gearing because of all that<br>wonderful Housing Development around<br>Kenner Peru but they've got on with it<br>and I want other ewe to enjoy that but<br>then you ask the the next question where<br>to from there<br>I am adamant<br>that if the institutional State doesn't<br>honor<br>the commitments that were made by the<br>political state<br>then we'll be back to the drawing boards<br>again because we say that they're full<br>and final and yet there are many<br>undertakings<br>that have not been honored by the crowd<br>so it's the again it's the state has to<br>get its act in order recognize that<br>these are not commercial deals which are<br>done and dusted and you can move on to<br>something else they are I believe that<br>constitutional agreements<br>and that there is a real obligation on<br>the part of the state to ensure that<br>these are honored and more than that<br>that uh<br>if I can use Pentecost Sunday we've got<br>to breathe the spirit into these<br>agreements on a regular basis because<br>they are not dry commercial agreements<br>and if they are treated like that then<br>folks they're going to fail and the next<br>generation will be back to the drawing<br>board<br>thank you any other comments on there I<br>mean Christopher's made some very<br>powerful statements and I certainly<br>support them as a as an ewe leader I'm<br>often asked and invited to meet with ewe<br>who've just settled and one of the<br>couple of things that I say to them<br>first of all to get yourself through<br>negotiating a a claim requires quite a<br>different set of skills and expertise<br>for actually driving through an agenda<br>of building the prosperity of an ewe<br>they're very different set of skill sets<br>and so I say to ewe that have just set<br>or really invest in your strategic plan<br>going forward but also identify the key<br>capability skill sets that you require<br>to drive your drive the future forward<br>for your people and thirdly there's no<br>such thing as over communication you've<br>got to get out there and talk it to your<br>people but also to The Wider public<br>about what you are doing natitor is an<br>excellent example that is operating<br>under the radar and in a very short<br>space of time you know they're they're<br>at the they're almost a billion dollar<br>entity<br>um<br>we were the first ones off the rank but<br>there were a number of others coming as<br>well<br>Napoli I'm going to acknowledge Napoli<br>because that is the the claim that store<br>has to be resolved and I'm having got an<br>apple here whanau and friends I hope<br>that that can be achieved certainly in<br>my lifetime<br>the daughter we are close to time but I<br>I might ask one question Jim<br>father<br>fascinating discussion<br>but my question cuts to the chase I<br>think having been involved with treaty<br>settlements from the beginning in the<br>thank you tainui I've said it many many<br>times Having the courage to go first<br>somebody had to break the mold<br>and it's certainly not our friends not<br>probably up the north ever a bit more if<br>we go down just make that observation<br>and passing<br>um and of course I worked with Chris on<br>tuhoi and that was remarkable when we<br>reached the decision and it was in the<br>office with Chris finlinson and his team<br>that rather than dividing ourselves<br>Forever on who owned the land<br>we declared the land owned itself and<br>that is<br>a dramatic shift in the normal approach<br>to everything it is an owner somebody<br>has to be the owner<br>this we turned around<br>and said no<br>the land owns itself<br>we are just say to look after to manage<br>it and when you think about that that of<br>course fits entirely into the whole<br>environmental in in conservation debate<br>and whatever we're doing and and fits in<br>very well and it's good but that wasn't<br>my question I got so stranger<br>my question is we'll bring out the cough<br>soon my my question is the much more<br>serious one<br>most new zealanders see co-governments<br>as giving preference to one part of New<br>Zealand over another I'm sorry I they<br>half them seemed to approach me because<br>somehow that I'm responsible for them no<br>idea why but and ask me what we're going<br>to do about it and I'd like the panel to<br>how do we move people I can't accept<br>what Chris and paragraphy have been<br>saying in terms of what we should be<br>talking about<br>but we're not as a society as a<br>community we're not how do we move the<br>community to that space so they have<br>that what I describe as a broader<br>understanding of what we're talking<br>about one based on the treaty because<br>I'm somewhat fearful if we don't we have<br>one political party who looks like<br>they're going to be influential wants to<br>have a referendum on what the treaty<br>means could you think of anything more<br>divisive<br>in New Zealand than that but that's a<br>serious proposition and and it's been<br>said it will be part of the requirement<br>to go into a coalition<br>to possibly form the next government<br>so we have some big issues not just<br>being Keen to get the view of the panel<br>thank you thank you<br>Jason I might start at your ends and<br>then uh we won't go too long on this<br>because I'm conscious we um as you said<br>with uh Theodore and the tuhoi I think<br>this that discussion does lead directly<br>into our next panel around taking care<br>of the environment but Jason you're<br>taking them we'll go quickly through<br>thank you for the question<br>um<br>I guess um the future just just briefly<br>um I think that the what we could do is<br>to model<br>the process of having a debate on what<br>uh in Partnership under tutility or<br>waitangi looks like on what we hope it<br>to be or what we want it to be so uh<br>that everyone sort of has a feel like<br>they can be part of the conversation<br>part of the debate and share their views<br>but model it on what we you know what<br>what the what the treaty sort of says<br>around partnership so basically a<br>partnership-based approach it's not once<br>I'd say well we're going to define it<br>it's not the other saying well we're<br>already there it's actually how do we<br>bring both parties together and have a<br>have a meaningful discussion about the<br>future uh and just lastly uh you know<br>waitangi settlements treaty settlements<br>is not the end it's just the beginning<br>correct it's the beginning of our<br>relationship together and it sets out<br>some rules some values and some things<br>that we've got to do towards one another<br>and if we follow them<br>would be okay<br>um oh gosh this is probably a session uh<br>on its own to be honest Matt but um from<br>my perspective it is doing what uh Jason<br>has recommended and also you know we've<br>got to get more of the communications<br>and have more conversations like this<br>but I also wonder too whether we need to<br>engage more proactively with the Next<br>Generation because they uh and I and I<br>think of my children<br>um and my mokopuna they have quite a<br>different take on us as a nation and<br>they're more exposed to the Maori Del<br>Pacifica to other cultures and<br>um and I think that's where the effort<br>in energy has to be put to be honest I<br>think we have to accept there will<br>always be a part of our population that<br>will never and will are not interested<br>in engaging on matters to do with the<br>tariti but I don't believe and this is<br>me being the person that I am that that<br>is the same with our younger generation<br>where we've got this introduced into the<br>very quickly I think there are two limbs<br>to it it's first know what you're<br>talking about<br>uh and that's the responsibility of the<br>political class to have clarity about<br>what they're talking about and the<br>reason why we have some unfortunate<br>outbursts about co-governances because<br>the<br>the the the the concept is muddled and<br>It's upsetting otherwise good people I<br>agree with paracafia you're always going<br>to have the<br>Douglas heard called them the SAR right<br>you know they hate homosexuals hate Jews<br>the walks we're going to kill a you're<br>always going to have those people but<br>the vast majority of people uh have good<br>intentions and are well spirited but<br>they need to know what you're talking<br>about and it's muddled at the moment so<br>I can understand why there's some fear<br>and so clarity about are we moving<br>beyond what<br>I negotiated in my nine years into new<br>territory of co-governs if we are why<br>are we doing it and what do we mean by<br>it and the second thing is once you have<br>Clarity explain and explain and explain<br>uh John Key took me to one side during<br>the foreshore and seabed debate and see<br>get out there and explain what you're<br>doing in words of one syllable and stop<br>talking like a lawyer uh and um it was<br>Sound Advice just constant repetition<br>and he used to say to us didn't he<br>Stephen you may get bored yourself I<br>don't care if you get bored your job is<br>to communicate the message so having a<br>message<br>that's not muddled and communicating it<br>repetitively and carefully does matter<br>and<br>also read Mr Finley okay I direct you to<br>chapter eight<br>all right um look a fantastic discussion<br>and also an important discussion I once<br>acknowledge uh all three of you for your<br>contributions today but also your<br>contributions to this outside of this<br>room very much appreciated and let's put<br>our hands together and then move on to</p></main><footer
