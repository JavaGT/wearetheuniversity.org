McKinnon who may be sitting closest<br>to me John McKinnon uh the former New<br>Zealand Diplomat and Senior public<br>servant uh Fran O'Sullivan will be known<br>to many and editorial Director of<br>Business for nzme and Charles Finney<br>partner at Sanders unsworth and former<br>New Zealand Diplomat and you can when<br>you read their biographies and the<br>program you'll see that they all have<br>significant experience here we are<br>somewhat compressed on time so we'll<br>jump straight into this I'm going to<br>start with you John you first went to<br>China or maybe greater China Hong Kong I<br>believe in the early 1970s<br>mid-1970s right correction noted um but<br>do you want to kick off with your your<br>brief comments and then we'll get into<br>the discussion well well thank you Matt<br>Kia oratato and it's a great pleasure to<br>be here and to have a chance to talk<br>about uh well China mostly but obviously<br>the city is broader than that as matters<br>so sensitively reminded me I did first<br>go to China in the mid-1970s some of you<br>may remember that period of time some of<br>you may not but I want to take you back<br>just a little bit further which is to<br>December 1972 50 years ago in December<br>which was where New Zealand established<br>diplomatic relations with the People's<br>Republic of China and I think that it's<br>fair to say that in doing that there was<br>a recognition that it was very hard for<br>New Zealand to operate in the Asia<br>Pacific Regional the indo-pacific region<br>as we often now call it without having<br>some sort of direct relationship with<br>the people in Beijing which had in fact<br>been the fact where there had been no<br>such relationship between 1949 and 19<br>1972. so that was a big part of it now<br>obviously there was also New Zealand<br>being New Zealand a desire that we would<br>benefit economically from that<br>relationship now there were people in<br>Europe who would say if only I could<br>sell one sock to China you know one<br>soccer every person in China I'd be<br>doing well I don't know why they never<br>say two socks but anyway it always seems<br>to be one sock the New Zealand<br>equivalent of that was the person in the<br>1940s who said if owning we could sell<br>one Pat of butter to each person in<br>China we'd be doing really well well<br>we've come actually quite close to that<br>but that was not the case in 1972 1973<br>uh in fact it took a while for the<br>economical commercial benefits of that<br>relationship to make themselves felt and<br>the point I want to make is that at the<br>end of the day it was about the need to<br>have a political relationship with China<br>which drove that decision in 1972 And I<br>think that's still a very valid point<br>now<br>now rolling the clock forward to when I<br>was in Beijing which was in 1978 to 80<br>1978 the end of 1978 was when Deng<br>Xiaoping returned to power in China for<br>about the third or fourth time and he<br>started a new policy a new external<br>policy for China because China had been<br>very conscious over the past 100 years<br>or so that it had been somehow<br>outsmarted by a lot of other countries<br>and it had experimented with many<br>different ways of trying to deal with<br>this but basically dung Xiaoping said<br>well the only way we can deal with this<br>is to integrate China with the rest of<br>the world economically and he set on a<br>path of doing that and that is what we<br>are now seeing today the fruits of that<br>decision which was taken in December<br>1978 although I doubt that even dung<br>Xiaoping himself really realized what<br>this was all going to lead to but one<br>thing it was very clear he did not see<br>it leading to was political<br>liberalization so shortly after the what<br>was called at that time the third plenum<br>which set the new path for China there<br>were demonstrations in Beijing calling<br>for the fifth modernization so the other<br>four modernizations were I think<br>agriculture Industries science<br>technology National Defense the fifth<br>one was to be democracy and Deng<br>Xiaoping made it very clear that he was<br>not interested in that in other words he<br>was not interested in modifying the<br>overarching position that the Communist<br>Party of China has in that polity and<br>it's worth bearing that in mind because<br>that has also continued to be very much<br>a part of what China's been all about<br>since that period of the 1970s but but<br>even before<br>uh dung's policies of course produced an<br>enormous increase in wealth in China<br>people argue now about whether you know<br>basically how many people were lifted<br>out of poverty maybe at 600 million<br>maybe it's 700 million they argue about<br>how many people are in the middle class<br>in China is it 200 million is it 300<br>million well if you're not very sure<br>whether it's 200 or 300 all you do know<br>is it's a lot of people when we think of<br>our own country and our own population<br>it's sort of rather dwarfs it from our<br>point of view the significance of that<br>was that a lot of these people were<br>interested in purchasing the goods and<br>services that this country produces so<br>well and to cap that off in 2008 uh we<br>we had the free trade agreement with<br>China which was upgraded last year and<br>it's just about to reach its final<br>conclusion uh on the 1st of January next<br>year and that has also led to a massive<br>increase in the Chinese economic<br>interaction with New Zealand so in 2023<br>we're in a very different world from the<br>world that we started off in in 1972 and<br>one of the other of course huge<br>differences in 2023 compared with 1972<br>as a change in the geopolitics<br>so in 1972 of course this was in the<br>wake of the Nixon Kissinger opening to<br>China A lot of it was about a collective<br>few that other countries including the<br>United States and China wanted to check<br>the Soviet Union<br>now whatever we may say about a<br>situation now it is certainly not that<br>and there are a lot of reasons why<br>things have changed and I don't want to<br>go into those but what I will say is<br>that for a country such as ours it is<br>really very challenging to have a<br>circumstance in which two of our major<br>partner countries the United States and<br>China have limited if not zero trust in<br>each other which means that anything<br>which happens and I'm not an expert on<br>balloons and I don't want to talk about<br>balloons but for anything which happens<br>it's interpreted in the most negative<br>way possible and that I have to say<br>applies on both sides so this is a very<br>tricky situation for a country such as<br>New Zealand because our interests lie in<br>both those places and it's often said<br>that you know we have an economic<br>relationship with China and a security<br>political relationship with the United<br>States I would say it's a little more<br>complicated than that because on the one<br>hand we actually the United States is a<br>big market for us we sell a lot of<br>things there we do very well there on<br>the other hand the Chinese certainly<br>expect a economic relationship to be<br>built on a very sound Foundation of a<br>political relationship so the two are<br>not exactly contrasting if anything they<br>have elements in of similar kind with<br>one another we have to find a way of<br>working through that and it was just<br>alluded to at the end to the previous<br>session that you know navigating well<br>this is the theme isn't it navigating is<br>is the way we have to go ahead but let's<br>not imagine it's going to be easy and<br>let's not imagine that it's going to uh<br>finish anytime soon I think the<br>circumstance we are looking at<br>geopolitically now is probably going to<br>be with us for a couple of decades at<br>least and we will have to constantly be<br>thinking about how how we manage those<br>things and in terms of our relationship<br>with China there are pluses obviously<br>China is a big big voice in the world<br>and on the region it's a it's a massive<br>market for us there's a big Chinese<br>presence now in New Zealand but they're<br>also obviously areas where we disagree<br>very much uh whether that's things which<br>happen domestically in China or things<br>would happen internationally so finding<br>our way through that is not going to be<br>straightforward but it's a task that we<br>will have to deliver on and we will have<br>to continue doing so for quite some<br>years thank you and a great<br>I guess Zoom back into some of the<br>historical recent historical context as<br>well as the current moment thank you<br>friend<br>yeah I'm going to um it's a real Cascade<br>of Records over over today much of which<br>also impinges on China<br>um I want to talk about what I perceive<br>right now as sort of an era of new<br>pragmatism in China and we've had you<br>know the period of covert we've had<br>china kind of withdrawing from the world<br>um Xi Jinping who did an amazing amount<br>of international trips as president uh<br>basically stayed home for the best part<br>of three years<br>but now you know at the end of last year<br>once you didn't been in door spy the<br>National Congress he'd put in place a<br>clean sweeper the Pollock Bureau brought<br>on to the polyp Bureau people like one<br>year the foreign affairs minister who is<br>now kind of a super Diplomat right at<br>the center of international Affairs in<br>China and he went ahead he signaled<br>covert was going to be all restrictions<br>lifted the borders were going to come<br>down and thus after a very very<br>painstaking period of a very sheltered<br>China it was actually quite a shock at<br>how quickly it has actually moved and<br>we've seen this period with massive<br>acceleration of Interest by investment<br>bankers all sorts of people the Asia<br>Financial Forum up in Hong Kong this<br>year was was deeply deeply optimistic in<br>January about what late<br>but you know what what lied ahead after<br>um you know the period of negativity<br>around China<br>um in our immediate backyard Penny Penny<br>Wong the Foreign Affairs uh Diplomat as<br>from um sorry in October Minister from<br>Australia she managed to get a meeting<br>uh with one year you saw the Albanese<br>government and Beijing start to take<br>very small steps but towards getting to<br>a period where the coercive measures<br>China had taken against Australia and<br>and largely from a really ridiculous<br>um<br>comment made by Maurice Payne wanting to<br>have a an inquiry into the origins of<br>covert Rush at the time when China was<br>just grappling with the bug itself and<br>so she was the foreign minister things<br>you know became very very uh difficult<br>New Zealand managed to um stir its way<br>around that without getting too far<br>embroiled and so I think we've seen some<br>positives there but it comes against a<br>period uh when in fact if you look at<br>the United States patience has run out<br>with China so at the same time China is<br>starting to tone back the wolf Warrior<br>rhetoric trying to get back out into the<br>world and you know get some sort of<br>resumption of a new normal it's at a<br>time when Ukraine is happening uh you<br>know comments about what's happening<br>with with China's role with Russia and a<br>whole pile of potentially really major<br>retaliatory moves to come out of the<br>United States against China on top of<br>the ones that have already been taken I<br>mean we cozy up to the United States and<br>we talk about the us as being one of the<br>major authors of um you know the peace<br>dividend of the last 30 40 50 years and<br>the international institutions<br>that have um you know kind of surrounded<br>that but the United States has been a<br>real recalcitrant and we need the United<br>States to step up but at the moment it's<br>not doing that and we have a situation<br>where you know right now it's looking at<br>imposing sanctions more sanctions on<br>China but this time in relation to steps<br>which have yet to be proven about<br>China's role with Russia in Ukraine and<br>the intelligence has not been on that<br>but this I was in<br>um Washington in October and I was<br>absolutely staggered at the depth of<br>emotion and feeling against China far<br>more so since January 2020 which was the<br>last time I was there pre-covered and at<br>that stage they'd done the inflation<br>reduction act underway the trips act<br>underway you know the barriers were<br>coming up U.S was becoming much more<br>industrial policy in its own country but<br>at the same time you go and talk to<br>organizations like the U.S Chamber of<br>Commerce and they said well that's only<br>part of what's likely to happen because<br>they had been briefed by the White House<br>that other sanctions would be considered<br>later and this poses a bit of an issue<br>for New Zealand because the sanctions<br>that we signed up to with Russia were<br>were pretty much cookie cutter sanctions<br>um you know right off the back of the<br>U.S treasury I do not believe that we<br>had the intelligence of this country and<br>capability uh to come up with that list<br>of names and all the um all the issues<br>where they were perceived to have<br>breached various Norms internationally<br>and you know the oligarchs and so forth<br>but if it goes to<br>expansion to be against China and you<br>know where the US goes out and rallies<br>the troops with the G7 then it becomes a<br>question where do we sit and all of that<br>and I think that's a big question and I<br>have no idea what the answer is but it's<br>it scares me frankly<br>thank you friend Charles<br>have a good afternoon and thanks thanks<br>for having me<br>um maybe the best place to begin is just<br>a word of warning uh I have never felt<br>so uncertain about our future in my<br>adult lifetime so normally by now I'd be<br>telling my clients who's going to win<br>the New Zealand election I would be<br>pretty confident knowing where where the<br>U.S politics was heading<br>um I would understand the operation of<br>global financial markets I understand<br>nothing right now nothing is behaving<br>the way it should and we're in a period<br>of real change in terms of major power<br>relations friends already alluded to<br>Australia trying to improve relations<br>with China actually I think the Biden<br>Administration wants to improve<br>relations with China too and China wants<br>to improve relations with the Biden<br>Administration but no one knows quite<br>how to do it uh so it's it's a really<br>challenging time to be thinking about<br>the New Zealand China relationship but<br>just on the United States it's amazing<br>that probably the world's most divided<br>politics agrees on one thing absolutely<br>and that is that China is is bad and and<br>um uh that uh China is the threat uh<br>that really complicates life uh for us<br>enormously there are some things that<br>are pretty obvious China is going to<br>remain our Major Market for many years<br>it's interesting uh listening to John's<br>uh reference to the the the uh a pad of<br>butter when I first served in Beijing in<br>1992 it was impossible to get the dairy<br>board interested in the China Market at<br>that point The View was Chinese did not<br>really like dairy products it was never<br>going to be a major Market that had<br>changed actually by the time I'd left<br>China but it was a real Apple battle and<br>the meat industry said all Chinese<br>people don't like eating sheet meat well<br>in both cases China is by far our<br>biggest dairy market and cheap meat<br>market now so it's very very important<br>to to keep challenge those perceptions<br>and on the services side of the equation<br>I think we will see quite a substantial<br>return to International students I just<br>wanted to people be very pleased with<br>that review and and and tourists from<br>from from China I think the challenge is<br>actually going to be our immigration uh<br>settings and letting letting those<br>students uh back in but we also should<br>be realistic China is not going to be<br>growing as an economy as quickly as we<br>have been used to over the last 20 years<br>its population has begun an inevitable<br>Decline and over the next 50 or 60 years<br>it's going to have<br>uh it's probably going to be in per<br>capita terms become much more wealthy<br>but but you know if you're a producer of<br>infant powder and expect a straight line<br>upwards you've got a problem<br>um<br>the um uh Chinese government is also<br>making increasingly loud noises that the<br>Chinese<br>economy needs to be more self-sufficient<br>in the production of a number of<br>products that we are very good at<br>producing and exporting to China and<br>there are some real structural<br>challenges in the Chinese economy we've<br>got a very inefficient soe sector still<br>and there's a property bubble that needs<br>to be addressed<br>we need also to set our relationship<br>settings in the context of those of our<br>major other friends and partners around<br>the world the United States we've been<br>talking about but there's actually very<br>strong views growing in the EU about<br>China that we need to be mindful of UK<br>uh we need to be mindful of and Japan is<br>becoming increasingly independent and<br>assertive in its views and sees China as<br>as a problem needs to be addressed and<br>in China too don't forget that politics<br>is not quite as stable as they would<br>like us to believe but it's very<br>interesting now that Xi Jinping has<br>secured another five years we are seeing<br>a noticeable change in Attitude a slight<br>easing of some of the rhetoric towards<br>the rest of the world and a desire to<br>get out there and and be a bit more open<br>to dialogue with some that they had not<br>been prepared to uh talk to<br>I am really very worried though about<br>this<br>view that's formed in the United States<br>and the view that is growing uh in in<br>significance in other parts of the world<br>about China be being a a real threat and<br>it's all seems to be coming to a head<br>right now around Taiwan and the<br>cross-straight relationships actually<br>that's one thing I'm not really worried<br>about because there is no way China is<br>wanting to invade Taiwan at present and<br>they don't have the capability to do<br>that and they'd be very very worried<br>about the consequences of that act I<br>think that one of the problems we face<br>is that the Chinese have<br>kicked out a whole lot of journalists<br>from China<br>from the US from the UK and in Australia<br>and guess where they've turned up Taipei<br>they're not needing to produce copy and<br>the easiest thing to write about is the<br>crosstalk tensions as we're seeing much<br>more of this in our media and<br>unfortunately we still don't have New<br>Zealand media operating in that<br>critically important part of the world<br>for us we're very much getting a a view<br>which is derived from others in that<br>space a lot of the tension you're seeing<br>between China and Taiwan right now is<br>actually not about China and Taiwan it's<br>about China and the Democratic<br>uh Progressive Party in in Taiwan which<br>is in power you're seeing already a<br>dialogue between the kmt leadership and<br>the Chinese government if there's a<br>change of president in in Taiwan in a<br>year and a half's time you'll see a<br>noticeable uh Cooling and in um in the<br>rhetoric and and<br>um uh a change posturing don't forget<br>that China and Taiwan as recently as<br>2012 were negotiating their own Free<br>Trade Agreement uh fell down because of<br>of people flows and services regulations<br>but but they they were doing uh things<br>that people previously thought would be<br>Unthinkable so look we we need to as<br>John has been indicating have as good a<br>possible relationship<br>um and broadly a broad relationship with<br>China that extends Beyond economics and<br>trade The View that we can just ignore<br>um<br>things we don't like and just focus on<br>trade and and investment unfortunately<br>is naive and I don't think can be the<br>way we operate in the future but there<br>are things that that we agree on and<br>there will be things we disagree on we<br>need to have a mature relationship um if<br>we disagree with something or we can say<br>it uh if China disagrees with something<br>we do they they can tell us<br>um and we should get used to those<br>differences but we really need to be<br>putting a lot of effort<br>um into<br>looking for those opportunities where we<br>are on the same page I think climate<br>change actually is one where we can work<br>very closely uh together and actually<br>even though they they have broken a few<br>International rules recently in the<br>trade space I think China at the end of<br>the day does believe in the rules<br>rules-based International order and we<br>can uh we can work with them on<br>strengthening that<br>I do worry what would happen if Trump<br>comes back because he is already talking<br>about even more tariffs than he had<br>before and goodness knows what that's<br>going to mean for our situation so as<br>New Zealand business people if there are<br>still some in the room<br>um please<br>take a really close look at what's going<br>on but be very sophisticated in in your<br>analysis it's not a binary thing uh I<br>either or there's a lot of nuance try<br>and understand it and I do think we can<br>navigate our way through by investing a<br>lot more in the relationship<br>Toyota Charles thank you<br>um<br>I'm reflecting on the last couple of<br>days and then the session if you were to<br>have sat in this room as a visitor to<br>New Zealand and you were trying to<br>understand New Zealand's position facing<br>out into the world you would quickly<br>realize well actually a lot of politics<br>is domestic and so some of the things we<br>project out into the world are a<br>reflection of the realities many of us<br>have<br>a surface level understanding of China<br>some have a very deep understanding but<br>John I'm going to go to you and then<br>I've got other other questions I'll<br>bring back to Charles and Fran<br>what are we maybe not seeing that's<br>happening within China<br>that would help explain their role in<br>the world they will be less obvious to<br>an audience that understands some<br>Dynamics reads you know where it's a<br>well-informed audience but if we're not<br>close to China Watchers what's actually<br>happening on the inside that leads to<br>those projections so should I give an<br>hour lecture or just<br>um I mean I think it it is challenging<br>but uh and and Charles actually alluded<br>to some of the challenges which China<br>faces which are demographic which are<br>environmental which are also economic so<br>in some ways getting a realization that<br>uh China is not immune from the sort of<br>challenges that our societies face is<br>quite important secondly scale I mean<br>you talked about the fact that the<br>population is going to have well it will<br>still be even if it halves and I'm not<br>sure we'll have as traumatically as that<br>but it would still be 600 million people<br>or possibly 700 million I mean you're<br>still talking about a lot of people and<br>that's possibly something which is<br>rather hard for us to grasp I I used to<br>get into well not trouble in China but<br>uh those of you who've studied Asian<br>languages will know they use the unit of<br>10 000 as the means of counting which<br>means to translate from debt into our<br>form of counting always creates problems<br>so I used to say we have 4.5 million<br>people which we did then and you could<br>see people not he actually means 45<br>million and then I would say and we have<br>27 million sheep and he would say you'd<br>say he means 2.7 million uh because they<br>couldn't comprehend a country which had<br>4.5 million people and 27 million sheep<br>I mean maybe we can't comprehend it<br>either but but so there are those those<br>differences which are extremely<br>um uh sort of self-evident if you're<br>living in China but not so evident if<br>you're coming from here the final one I<br>would simply mention is the is the role<br>of the of the Communist party I mean we<br>we've as been talked about a lot in the<br>course of the last two days we live in a<br>liberal democracy we have free speech we<br>have freedom of religion we have freedom<br>of all sorts of things it's a very<br>different proposition in China and this<br>is not making a commentary about you<br>know which system is good which isn't it<br>it's just it's part of the reality of<br>China that that party controls uh what<br>happens in that country and it has done<br>so since 1949 so this is not some sort<br>of Flesh in the pan this is something<br>which is deeply embedded in the way<br>China operates and that's an important<br>thing for people to bear in mind when<br>they uh when they move to China and do<br>business there thank you thank you I'm<br>going to um there have been quite a few<br>questions that<br>are coming in that relate to our<br>relationship with China China's<br>relationship with the West which is the<br>center here in our relationship with<br>others I might start with you friend<br>you've just been in the States you<br>talked about that<br>um how realistic is it for us to<br>navigate an independent foreign policy<br>as separate from traditional Airlines oh<br>I think it's absolutely essential I<br>think when you see the two elephants<br>play you never know when they're going<br>to make up and you can get on the wrong<br>side of things and we have even seen<br>with Australia I think we were quite<br>wise not to go too far down into the<br>Australia you know attempt to fight back<br>against China's coercion because in some<br>ways given the nature of the Beast they<br>kind of provoked it anyway and they had<br>missteps which the current prime<br>minister has acknowledged carefully and<br>that that's you know kind of getting<br>back on the road again I've got to be I<br>think we've got to be careful not to go<br>to a party to which we're not really<br>invited and we need to be very careful<br>about that but at the same time I think<br>we still have to stand up for<br>uh democratic ideals um so if there are<br>issues within our own country where<br>we've seen<br>um you know Chinese media uh coming<br>under pressure Chinese<br>um population here we need to stand up<br>for that not to happen and so you know<br>there's there's tension there but but<br>it's interesting I mean I had a very<br>long conversation with two people who<br>came back from China this year having<br>gone back during covert not being able<br>to get back having had aging relatives<br>and in China that they wanted to um you<br>know pay attention to look after out in<br>the provinces and and it was sort of<br>essentially around what are the<br>conversations around China that aren't<br>necessarily at the top of the CCP and<br>all of that but you know in terms of<br>Taiwan which Charles mentioned like what<br>do Chinese really feel about going to<br>war do they really want to lose a<br>million people or so if they go into a<br>war to which they're not military<br>prepared for so people are talking about<br>this uh new maoism do they really want<br>Jay casting the role of a modern mouth<br>you know the kind of invisible hand of<br>the market Guided by the visible hand of<br>government and that that kind of you<br>know syndrome there young people to they<br>want a democratic future or do they want<br>to have a more nationalistic future and<br>the other one uh that same theme that<br>seemed to come through was about<br>business innovators can they actually<br>build a future in China now or will they<br>have to go offshore and the case was<br>made about Jack ma who's been holding<br>out in um in Tokyo because things are<br>not comfortable for him at the moment<br>and he's the founder of Alibaba who had<br>the world's largest IPO pulled by the<br>Chinese government because it was a<br>threat to the financial system so um you<br>know the the boundaries have gone out<br>and some of their business people when<br>you look at<br>um<br>some of the studies coming out of China<br>and the US I mean they are leapfrogging<br>in some elements of Technology the<br>United States and this would have been<br>seen Unthinkable a few years ago so you<br>know there's this Rising power is um is<br>kind of<br>pressing out there but I think we have<br>to treat China with respect I think we<br>have to treat the United States with<br>respect and I would I would hope that as<br>we normalize by getting out into the<br>world seeing each other again you know<br>business missions going back into China<br>from the US as well as New Zealand and<br>everywhere else that we can establish<br>some Norms that take down<br>you know the tension a little bit and I<br>think that's really important<br>thank you I'm going to come to you now<br>Charles is a question that's come<br>through and it was it was General but<br>it's I think particularly applicable<br>you started your comments by saying look<br>it's very hard to know what's going on<br>and yet people come to you for advice on<br>some of these matters what advice do you<br>give given that uncertainty because it's<br>a theme of this conference the world is<br>the world is complex you know saying<br>it's too complex isn't really an option<br>what what advice would you give either<br>to policy makers and politicians or to<br>businesses and how to think about China<br>at this time<br>well in terms of the business business<br>um uh I actually was asked to<br>um talk to a quite major International<br>board that was meeting in Auckland uh<br>recently and they were really interested<br>in New Zealand China relations their big<br>question was you know is New Zealand<br>going to be treated the same way<br>Australia has been treated by China are<br>we going to fall into that trap and my<br>advice was I'd be very surprised I think<br>there's a huge difference between uh our<br>settings and Australian settings there's<br>no you can't discount the possibility<br>that some politician will say something<br>that China really doesn't like and then<br>they'll whack us around the ears and<br>using Traders as their mechanism but I<br>I'm reasonably confident that will not<br>not not be the case<br>um<br>and we've talked a lot about<br>um actually the fact that you New<br>Zealand<br>policy makers can't make decisions<br>independent from what's going on<br>um in in The Wider region and and<br>globally and so it's really putting<br>probably much more uh effort into<br>understanding those geopolitical uh<br>tensions uh then we probably are used to<br>as New Zealand boards<br>um and if you can't do it in-house and I<br>think you can actually do a lot in-house<br>get that expertise in every six months<br>or every year when you're having your<br>strategy sessions build geopolitics into<br>your into your<br>discussion and and make sure you have a<br>really good<br>risk policy as as a board and you're<br>taking decisions with<br>um a full understanding of the risks<br>you're taking I'm pretty comfortable<br>overall with our level of<br>trade dependency on on China but there<br>are certain industries that are very<br>dependent I Hope they've got a plan B<br>and a plan C<br>um<br>one of the plan B plan C options has<br>come through in a question<br>around if uh if China were to align more<br>closely with Russia<br>what then so<br>to any of you would anybody like to<br>greet weight you go you go friend first<br>um and I think and I think the first<br>thing is do we think that's likely let's<br>not you know completely you know well I<br>think China is playing very carefully at<br>the moment because<br>um you know if you look at just uh the<br>rhetoric over the last few days the<br>meeting with the Belarus president and<br>so forth and so on and some sort of<br>indication of wanting to see not quite a<br>peace plan but the first steps toward it<br>and the us obviously feels that doesn't<br>go far enough and they may well be right<br>but um you know but China is sort of not<br>really come out on this issue until<br>about now it doesn't go as far as where<br>politicians like Jacinda ardern<br>um you know had remonstrated with XI at<br>Apec last year about you know use your<br>influence at um in the UN and Elsewhere<br>on this<br>um you know and they have been allies<br>over a long time so so it's difficult<br>but um you know we'll just have to wait<br>really to see how it how it plays out<br>but I think just um you know I don't I<br>well all bits are off hunted if they um<br>if they do seriously get into bed<br>together<br>then it does come into that question<br>about if it's a major challenge to World<br>Peace where do we search and you know as<br>one cynic said to me the other day and<br>it might even have been me<br>um<br>that um in some ways you need to have a<br>war to create the new peace dividend and<br>that's a terrible way of looking at it<br>but this is also a view that um you know<br>you kind of here in the United States<br>and some of the think tanks around the<br>hill you hear an element of that coming<br>through on China side as well and<br>Chinese people particularly I think<br>within the Realms of the party uh you<br>know when you talk to people who are On<br>The Fringe of all of that I mean they do<br>actually see this as a potential that<br>there may be you know a major dust up of<br>some sort and then after that the new<br>bones of a new world order might emerge<br>and jump in on this one<br>um I I think that China<br>initially misplayed their position over<br>what Russia was going to do to Ukraine<br>and suddenly realized that they'd made a<br>mistake and have become much more much<br>more careful I think the Chinese view<br>was that the West Was impossibly<br>fractured wouldn't come together uh and<br>that Russia would ROM poem and and take<br>a lot of Ukraine real fast and that<br>hasn't happened and they've learned a<br>lot from that and both in terms of wider<br>diplomacy and international structures<br>but also militarily they're learning<br>lessons all the time I think New Zealand<br>business should be watching what's<br>happening very closely because<br>at the end of the day I I see huge<br>potential for China to be benefiting<br>enormously<br>um from the fact that they're still<br>they're not sectioning they've still got<br>a commercial relationship with Russia<br>they will be investing more in Russia<br>and due course and Russia's got an awful<br>lot of dairy product an awful lot of<br>meat and an awful lot of tree and fish<br>so so we could see China coming out of<br>this with um a very interesting dividend<br>not necessarily peace dividend but a<br>commercial dividend and it wouldn't be<br>necessarily aligning with the interests<br>well I'm going to take refuge on the<br>politicians thing which is I don't<br>answer a hypothetical question brilliant<br>but uh but no I mean I think what we I<br>would agree with Fran I think China war<br>is acting very carefully I think this is<br>alluded to earlier in the earlier today<br>and I would imagine it's got very<br>mindful it's a set of equities with all<br>sorts of countries over the world<br>including Russia<br>can I zoom right back maybe a for a look<br>at time here the<br>somebody earlier today mentioned the<br>sort of Francis fukuyama there was a<br>view of end of history that most<br>countries are moving towards democracy<br>capitalism this was the drift Samuel<br>Huntington same same time releases Clash<br>of civilizations that no this is not<br>going to work out<br>um Huntington wins for Kiama says yup<br>got it wrong is there is the the simple<br>synthesis but are we looking<br>it actually returned to Norms where<br>we've been in an unusual period of calm<br>Tim grosser at this forum last year<br>talked about Pax Americana there's been<br>a liberal ideology that<br>um has been able system maybe that's<br>been supported by America's wealth and<br>Military might and actually this is more<br>a normal situation where there are<br>vastly different views of the world<br>between superpowers and we should expect<br>that and as a smaller country will be<br>wedged between those elephants at some<br>time<br>join any views well I think I think<br>you've got to be a bit careful not to<br>conflate the current state of affairs<br>with a more permanent shift because<br>there is the world operates differently<br>now from what it did say before World<br>War one I mean we just for instance had<br>the G20 foreign Minister's meeting in<br>Delhi I think it was a few days ago now<br>that that sort of thing you know which<br>put you know is slightly obviously<br>uncomfortable you know interaction<br>between the Russian and the American<br>foreign ministers that could not have<br>happened before and the fact that you've<br>got those sort of Institutions and those<br>sort of Arrangements means that whatever<br>is going on internationally is in a very<br>different space a very different<br>framework from what it was<br>on the on the other point you know about<br>you know where are things hitting I mean<br>this is perhaps slightly parenthetical<br>to your to your question Matt but I<br>think whatever is going to happen in<br>China will happen because Chinese people<br>want it to happen it won't happen<br>because somebody outside says well we<br>think you're hitting in such and such a<br>direction and therefore in due course<br>you know your political system will<br>catch up with your economic system I<br>just don't think that that's the way<br>it's going to be which is not to say<br>there mightn't be changes but there'll<br>be changes which will be generated<br>internally rather than externally thank<br>you any other views<br>now keep going there are several<br>questions here around<br>trade relationships and one question was<br>that there are obvious you know a common<br>refrain and board risk sessions and so<br>on as around diversification and there<br>are some obvious limits to that at the<br>at the trade level or downsides and<br>trade-offs and that how might businesses<br>and organizations think about<br>diversification partnership but also<br>maintaining strong and respectful<br>relationships with China can I answer<br>that because I'm going to have to catch<br>another plane in a few seconds<br>um I'll give the upload anyway<br>um I I think the problem is not<br>diversification in the markets we can<br>sell everything we want to sell it's the<br>price that we are receiving and then the<br>problem we face which is a good problem<br>to have right now is that China is<br>prepared to pay top dollar and and we<br>can't match that but it was very<br>interesting in the early stages of<br>covert when we did lose the Chinese<br>market for six weeks or so for certain<br>products we were able to shift pretty<br>quickly Indonesia some other markets uh<br>Sri Lanka took took a lot of dairy<br>unfortunately it's not able to afford<br>that right now if we have to do it again<br>but but<br>um there are other markets there the<br>problem is is is is price which is why<br>New Zealand companies should be doing<br>the sensible thing which is trying to<br>maximize returns<br>um but but always have a view to what<br>happens if things go wrong and it's not<br>just a political risk it can be an<br>economic risk risk and there could be<br>another covert<br>so and and John mentioned uh water<br>before there's a huge problem in China<br>Sometimes some years of a drought<br>um and um that's got much wider<br>implications anyway I'm sorry I have to<br>go thank you very much no no thank you<br>Charles any last comments before we wrap<br>up<br>pick up on the trade point one of the<br>things that is quite interesting in July<br>New Zealand will host the cptpp<br>commission and that is you know kind of<br>the regulatory body of ministers who get<br>together annually and make sure the<br>comprehensive whatever and whatever the<br>old TPP it was that that's operating<br>um professionally now the United Kingdom<br>is just ready to join that and China and<br>Taipei are also in the queue and so one<br>of the Strategic decisions we have to<br>make is<br>will we as chair help to facilitate that<br>or not and it's really interesting that<br>China is choosing to try and become part<br>of that whereas the US which was one of<br>the originated countries has not done so<br>at the moment Japan which is a bit of a<br>proxy for the us and this debate is<br>basically saying um you know they're not<br>so keen on their uh prime minister Lee<br>in Singapore is Keen on that he sees it<br>as a way of kind of enveloping uh China<br>in a new kind of you know basically<br>keeping them in the tent and you have to<br>remember also with the regional economic<br>comprehensive partnership China is also<br>part of that so in some ways it is in<br>subclubs and then there's the potential<br>to bring it into another club it also<br>like the United States wants to be part<br>of setting the rules of business for the<br>next little while so there are issues<br>there there's obviously data a whole<br>range of issues but they had the ndrc<br>out here a couple of years ago and they<br>were basically studying what would be<br>the preconditions for China to come into<br>this and would it be an element of<br>modernizing its own economy so you know<br>there's things there which are actually<br>potentially optimistic in the long run<br>I was about to end on exactly that note<br>the word optimism so<br>a last question to both of you before we<br>we close what do you see is the greatest<br>opportunities for us in this<br>relationship is we never get it forward<br>well I think the the greatest<br>opportunity is simply that uh there is<br>going to be continue to be a large group<br>of people in China it may not be quite<br>as large as we thought but a large group<br>of people in China who are interested in<br>purchasing what we want to what we<br>Supply whether that's food whether<br>that's scenery whether that's English<br>language education or whatever<br>and I think that is going to continue to<br>be a key ingredient in New Zealand's<br>economic future now it won't only be<br>China though you know every other<br>country in the world is sort of in this<br>business as well but I would see that as<br>being a place where we should put some<br>effort and by doing so we do need to<br>have a robust political relationship<br>with China at the same time but I think<br>I think we can manage that I mean I said<br>earlier this is going to be a difficult<br>challenge but I do think we can respond<br>um look I I think it is New Zealand<br>continuing to have a voice at the table<br>to develop people-to-people uh<br>connections further than we do and<br>particularly as we are now coming out of<br>covert uh I think the Maori business<br>Community shows extraordinary leadership<br>in this regard<br>um often you know the question comes up<br>and various people Paul Morgan and<br>others are quite vocal of you know kind<br>of asked about what might be happening<br>on human rights in China and says well<br>guys look closer to home in New Zealand<br>what happened to our human rights trade<br>is a great equalizer and I think it's a<br>great way of connecting and when you<br>have um you know commerce between<br>countries it helps to set up the<br>preconditions for peace in my view yeah<br>I agree<br>all right look I will leave it there<br>because I'm conscious that we uh we<br>promised we would get people out at 1 30<br>and so I'm just gonna thank you both and<br>Charles and extension for a um you know<br>Hamilton airport Waits for No One and uh<br>for a fantastic session I really<br>appreciate your insights</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
