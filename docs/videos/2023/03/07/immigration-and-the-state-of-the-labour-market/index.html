School).</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>as Matt mentioned we've already been<br>talking about immigration or had it<br>covered a little this morning and I<br>think that focusing on issues that may<br>pose particular constraints on the<br>economy is really crucial to this 2023<br>discussion of sustainable growth<br>productivity and well-being while we're<br>navigating these Heavy Seas so I think<br>the session is really crucial to what<br>we're talking about in this forum and we<br>are turning now of course to immigration<br>the state of the labor market and we'll<br>be considering whether this might be the<br>greatest handbrake to New Zealand and<br>the New Zealand economy at the moment<br>our three speakers that we have with us<br>today we've got speaking first will be<br>John mccaskill Smith John is the chief<br>Network officer of tend Health Limited<br>our second speaker will be Rachel<br>Simpson Rachel is the manager for<br>Education skills<br>at business New Zealand thanks Rachel<br>and the third speaker is my colleague<br>professor John Gibson he's in the<br>economics Department here with me at<br>waikato management School<br>so I'd like to hand straight over to our<br>first speaker<br>John<br>Fiona thank you<br>um yeah my name is John mccaskill Smith<br>I'm I'm kind of here as the result of<br>the apology that was made before about<br>someone not being able to be here so I<br>apologize uh in advance<br>um I'm not an immigration uh expert I'm<br>I'm from the health sector so there'll<br>be a little bit of a carry-on from I<br>guess the session um this morning around<br>some of the the struggles around the<br>impact of immigration on the health<br>sector from my kind of perspective but<br>there was just a couple of comments that<br>I really wanted to kind of touch on I<br>think um and and I guess continuing on<br>from some of the themes that came out of<br>the session this morning as well<br>I think that the health sector is<br>complex like um any any industry that we<br>have operating<br>but um it's confused because it's often<br>seen as the public health sector and so<br>therefore there's a sense that it needs<br>to be run by Wellington and run by the<br>government but in actual fact um all of<br>us live at home uh and our home can mean<br>different things for different people<br>but 99.9 of the time we look after<br>ourselves and that's really what the<br>health sector is<br>when we do need care the bulk of care<br>actually takes place in the community so<br>it's outside of the infrastructure<br>that's owned by the government and<br>really off the balance sheet in terms of<br>infrastructure so that's general<br>practice it's primary care it's<br>Community Care it's ewe providers uh<br>it's NGO kind of sector so not not<br>government-owned government funded and<br>often linked to policy but that's where<br>the bulk of care takes place and then at<br>the kind of very Downstream point is the<br>hospital system where<br>um we can see the pressures that are on<br>there now and I I'd really like to put<br>up the the proposition that a lot of<br>pressure we're seeing on the hospital<br>system is a result of you know the poor<br>immigration and uh poor thinking about<br>um the Upstream infrastructure that<br>really looks after most of us in terms<br>of our our health<br>now we did a piece of work back in 2006<br>with the University of waikato where we<br>um we pulled the demographics in so we<br>looked at you know uh the organization I<br>was working for then we had about half a<br>million new zealanders enrolled with us<br>um across what was then five dhb uh dhbs<br>across the middle part of the north<br>island and um we aged that population we<br>took the disease burden and we aged that<br>and then we put it up against our supply<br>side which was actually our ability to<br>provide care in the community<br>now this is this is 2006 and we forecast<br>then that by 2027 would be 1.5 million<br>GP consult short<br>now at the time we were providing about<br>a million GP consults a year uh in the<br>same kind of sector so the sense that we<br>had to double the size of our capacity<br>our supply to meet the coming need that<br>was kind of coming through so that was<br>pretty clear and we worked quite closely<br>with<br>um the end of the labor government<br>moving into the key government then<br>around the modeling around there and to<br>try and get the investment but I guess<br>it just stopped there and like the other<br>thing that's occurred over the same kind<br>of period of time is that the workforce<br>demographics have changed significantly<br>so back then we relied heavily 66<br>percent of the GPS in the Midland kind<br>of area their base medical degree was<br>offshore so we were really really<br>heavily reliant on a Workforce that was<br>not from New Zealand and that's actually<br>got worse not better the other thing<br>that we've seen that's changed is back<br>then 88 of the GPS and this cohort uh<br>had some stake in the game so they were<br>owner operators or they owned a part of<br>the business they operated in Now by<br>2018 that had completely flipped we'd<br>moved to only 26 percent of the<br>workforce had any ownership Stakes so<br>the bulk of the workforce had moved to<br>either contracted sessional workers or<br>salaried workers<br>there'd also been a major gender shift<br>um in the primary community so we saw a<br>flip as well to a heavily uh feminized<br>Workforce and we moved from one ft<br>doctor being roughly one doctor to 150<br>doctor requiring 2.7 doctors to make up<br>that FTE because people were choosing<br>not to work uh in the same way that they<br>were before now the consequence of all<br>these things kind combined together<br>um Dr Janet Skeets who was working with<br>us at the time you know she described it<br>as the perfect storm so aging Baby<br>Boomers entering into retirement with<br>longer term more complex care that you<br>know requires more to happen Hospital<br>systems that were not kind of being<br>resized and refocused um the balance<br>sheet and health really being dhbs and<br>hospitals so the Crown's kind of focus<br>was always on the struggle in the<br>hospitals there'd been a capping of<br>funding into the primary and Community<br>sector through a capitation kind of<br>model which you know essentially<br>resulted in we'll leave that alone we<br>don't need to worry about it and the<br>health system just kind of missed the<br>whole point of what was going on with<br>that perfect storm so the the point you<br>come back to the immigration point is we<br>simply we're not training enough uh in<br>the health sector to meet your your<br>needs as you age and I look around and I<br>think you know the demographics and here<br>are uh you're sliding into that age<br>category where you're going to need more<br>and more Health Services<br>I say that respectfully<br>um but the reality is<br>um they're not going to be there or<br>you're going to have long Waits and also<br>to highlight that fact that we've got a<br>health system outside and inside of the<br>hospitals that relies heavily on foreign<br>trained doctors and nurses and others<br>I'm using sort of doctors as a proxy for<br>this and I think this the strategy and I<br>was just talking with my colleague here<br>it's um unfathomable from the house City<br>we have no idea what the government's<br>trying to do with immigration um we also<br>run immigration uh medical services and<br>we can't even forecast the volumes that<br>will begin coming through not just for<br>the health sector but for anybody else<br>it's like we're running blind so this<br>perfect storm is going to affect every<br>single one of you because you're all<br>going to need health services as you age<br>and the health services are going to be<br>harder and harder to find so<br>um I've got lots lots and lots of<br>questions about the immigration point<br>and I've got lots of other kind of<br>examples but that's just a bit of an<br>intruder get us going great thanks<br>something like a perfect storm to get us<br>going huh Rachel can we pass along yeah<br>yeah everybody looks very young and<br>healthy in this room for me that's what<br>I think yeah yeah<br>um so the short answer to the question<br>is immigration our biggest handbrake to<br>the economy is yes<br>um the long answer to that is and I'm<br>going to take the lead here from some of<br>our speakers this morning is reflecting<br>on the fact that we've just been through<br>the experiment of what two years of no<br>immigration looks like and what we know<br>from that is during that period more new<br>zealanders and international people left<br>the country than came into it we have<br>one of the highest outbound rates of<br>people of any developed country so<br>actually that is some of the stuff that<br>that drives our alliance on immigration<br>and it's not the fault of the migrants<br>that we haven't planned or coordinated<br>infrastructure for the last 30 years to<br>be able to meet that growth because<br>actually when you look at the history of<br>immigration in New Zealand it has<br>roughly followed the flows of the labor<br>market when we have an extraordinarily<br>tight labor market immigration is up and<br>people looking for economic<br>opportunities won't come here if the<br>jobs aren't here so<br>um uh overall our immigration system has<br>actually served New Zealand<br>extraordinarily well and I think what we<br>see now is skill shortages across every<br>industry every region and every level<br>so when we look at the the current<br>policies and what we've gone through to<br>get to the point where we can open the<br>border and welcome immigration back<br>again<br>um unfortunately it's it's a lot harder<br>to turn everything back on than it was<br>to turn it off<br>um and we're seeing that now in terms of<br>thinking about how competitive is New<br>Zealand internationally on attracting<br>those skills because all of the<br>countries that we compare ourselves to<br>have gone out there and said immigration<br>is a key pillar of our economic recovery<br>and if they've gone out there with with<br>big offers right Canada has set up one<br>and a half million people in the next<br>three years will be given permanent<br>residency<br>we are still trying to work out what<br>those Pathways to residency look like in<br>New Zealand so we've got to make sure<br>that we can be internationally<br>competitive to be able to treat the kind<br>thanks Rachel oh thanks very much it<br>wouldn't be much of a panel if we agreed<br>so actually my short answer to the<br>subtitle of this panel is immigration<br>the biggest handbreak is actually a no<br>it's a no four weeks ago and it's still<br>a no now despite the new labor demands<br>that you know a recent tragic events<br>have brought along uh it's worth<br>pointing out and if I could have that I<br>have one one and only slide and so if<br>that slide could go up uh for me thanks<br>that<br>well if you're responsible for me to say<br>no and then to say well what is the<br>biggest handbrake and of course the<br>biggest handbrake is a persistently poor<br>productivity performance and so this is<br>the last four sentences of the last four<br>censuses and the um the colors at least<br>the first two bars are self-explanatory<br>we're black uh friends Across The Tasman<br>are in green uh and then the other three<br>bars are small oecd less than four<br>million less than six million or less<br>than 10 million okay so all of these are<br>are comparators for what might New<br>Zealand<br>um be in a different uh universe as it<br>were so New Zealand went from 18 foreign<br>born at the 2001 census to 26 foreign<br>born and so we were increasing the<br>foreign-born share at Double the rate of<br>Australia so we've already experienced<br>with large-scale immigration we're now<br>about 140 percent of the foreign-born<br>share that the other small oecd<br>countries have compared to you know<br>they've stated about 10 12 roughly no<br>Trend in those countries now what<br>happened whilst uh we we ran that<br>experiment of very large-scale<br>immigration uh well if you divide the<br>economy into the part which is is<br>tradable it's subject to International<br>competition so there's people producing<br>for export but there's also local firms<br>competing against Imports then in Real<br>GDP per capita terms the tradable sector<br>of the economy is no larger than it was<br>two decades ago all of the growth in the<br>New Zealand economy by and large has<br>occurred in the non-traded sector is<br>this a coincidence with the immigration<br>story is it causally related I can think<br>of well-respected economists formerly at<br>the IMF uh sorry and at the IMF and at<br>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the<br>treasury who would argue it is causally<br>related I'll leave others to to delve<br>into that but it's clearly the case that<br>this large-scale experiment of of<br>massive immigration by historic<br>standards and by the standards of air<br>comparative countries uh didn't yield a<br>productivity miracle for us at all<br>um and whether it will going forward is<br>is um is an open question and people<br>might say well you know why do we worry<br>about the fact that the economy is<br>increasingly skewed to the non-traded<br>part of the economy rather than to the<br>traded part well if I'm a consumer in<br>New Zealand and I'm thinking about<br>consuming a tradable good and I don't<br>like the New Zealand product because I<br>don't think the the supplier has been<br>keeping up with with the latest designs<br>or haven't been responsible by needs I<br>can I can go on to Amazon I can go onto<br>eBay and I can import it okay there's<br>some pressure onto the the supplier and<br>that's true for goods and services<br>certainly true for us in the in the<br>education business<br>um likewise the consumer overseas who<br>likes or doesn't like the New Zealand<br>export product has got a bunch of<br>Alternatives but if I'm trying to build<br>a house if I'm trying to get a resource<br>consent and I don't like the local<br>product I can't go on to Amazon and dial<br>it up even if I can go to Ikea and get a<br>flat pack house I can't import the land<br>okay and so the<br>supplier of non-traded goods and<br>services which is the vast majority of<br>the New Zealand economy is just under<br>much less competitive pressure much less<br>Innovative pressure and so we've seen<br>increasingly you know low productivity<br>because there isn't the pressure on<br>these and whilst we globalized on the<br>people front shown exactly by these<br>Rising black bars here shown exactly by<br>the sort of more micro stories from from<br>my two panelists we de-globalized on the<br>trades front and so all of these other<br>countries in this but that lie Behind<br>These Bars in this graph we're greatly<br>increasing their share of trade to GDP<br>Australia is below us but it's<br>increasing at much faster rate all of<br>the other small oecd countries are much<br>more tradable so we became less good at<br>trade and goods and services even as we<br>became better at importing people again<br>are they causally related time will tell<br>the second thing to note is that<br>immigration can often<br>paper over serious cracks so the obvious<br>question and perhaps the next panel is<br>going to answer this is well why has the<br>New Zealand education system not<br>delivered the the workforce which is<br>required why are we needing to go to<br>um there now obviously a self-interested<br>plug why do we have two medical schools<br>not three medical schools if we're so<br>short of doctors right but I'll tell you<br>another one and and and this one is is I<br>think very concerning<br>um<br>normally when the labor force survey<br>comes out of New Zealand it's only<br>quarterly it comes out if you know so<br>we've got the December household labor<br>force survey came out a few few weeks<br>ago only once per year in the June<br>quarter so we get the data in August<br>thereabouts we get the figures on<br>disability okay and so you may or may<br>not be aware that um from June 2019 to<br>June 2022 the working age population<br>that's non-disabled so working age<br>population 15 to 64 I think it is<br>um Rose by three percent so we didn't<br>have much population growth because the<br>Big Driver of population growth in New<br>Zealand in the short term is is<br>immigration of course and that was<br>largely closed off from the start of<br>2020.<br>the disabled population in the household<br>labor force survey grew by 13 and a half<br>percent so why are working age new<br>zealanders suddenly so much sicker okay<br>and this is not because of population<br>aging because we're staying within the<br>same time time range okay<br>um now well<br>um so and and and and and why does this<br>matter well if we look at the employment<br>rate and this is the employment over the<br>population rate so it rolls together<br>both the labor force participation rate<br>and the unemployment rate then the<br>employment rate for non-disabled in the<br>household labor force survey is 71 so 29<br>of working age population are either not<br>in the labor force or or are unemployed<br>okay and that's really that's a really<br>high rate right it's hard to get much<br>more participation than that but the<br>employment rate for the disabled uh<br>population is 25 so as we move people<br>from non-disabled into disabled for<br>whatever reason and and there are lots<br>of reasons for why it may be and I may<br>mention one depending on if I want to<br>get invited back next year<br>um then we see a basically a negative<br>shock to labor productivity the ability<br>of the economy to produce goods and<br>services goes down because we've got<br>this huge fall in in employment rates<br>from 71 to 25 but there's another Factor<br>too given our our approach to funding<br>health and disability it's very likely<br>that as we have more and more disabled<br>people that's going to be more Health<br>expenditure whereas if we have for<br>example and and that's a problem which<br>is unlikely to shift from New Zealand<br>most other countries are are generally<br>employing some health related tests<br>which would make it relatively hard for<br>someone with a disability which stops<br>them from from participating in<br>employment to also move somewhere else<br>and so this is a problem which we've got<br>for the expected lifetime of of this<br>group now you know what's causing it you<br>know long covert perhaps okay it was<br>already happening in 2021 too this is<br>not just specific to New Zealand the US<br>is seeing huge rise in disabilities in<br>the U.S at least and wherever this<br>occurs in New Zealand I don't know it's<br>up for others to to research it but at<br>the U.S at least there's pretty strong<br>evidence of some vaccine injury okay and<br>so again because we're not able to talk<br>about certain topics openly in New<br>Zealand then and the people who may be<br>affected by this are probably being I<br>believe the term is gaslit into saying<br>oh there isn't something wrong with you<br>it's in your head I don't know if that's<br>true or false but using variety of<br>different approaches in the US they're<br>getting up to figures of six or seven<br>percent uh of people who are suffering<br>uh serious adverse reactions which in<br>many cases are hampering their Workforce<br>participation right and so this is not<br>restricted to us and of course now<br>healthcare workers become more and more<br>important if we've got a a population<br>which is becoming less and less healthy<br>and so I think we've got to look just<br>first of all understand well what's<br>driving what's making new zealanders so<br>much less well than they were before and<br>maybe it's simple maybe it's just a<br>pandemic okay but but as I said the<br>timing and the positioning and the<br>similarity into other sectors means is<br>potentially something else going on as<br>well and so we can't rely I think on<br>immigration to to paper over these more<br>fundamental cracks okay and then the<br>other thing I was going to say too are<br>going back to the slide and the slide<br>can go in a moment we probably had the<br>worst possible combination we had<br>permissive immigration settings and very<br>restrictive land land<br>conversion or Urban Land Supply settings<br>and so that of course drove really high<br>house prices but it also drove home<br>ownership rates of the native born down<br>significantly and not just in the places<br>where immigrants were settling in high<br>proportion so not just in Queenstown<br>lakes or in parts of Auckland but<br>spilling over into the neighboring areas<br>as people can compete with the rising<br>house prices new zealanders or native<br>born were moving elsewhere putting more<br>pressure on there and so our home<br>ownership rates fell well if I'm no<br>longer owning a home in New Zealand I'm<br>much more likely to to move abroad you<br>know one of the main constraints to<br>moving is the fact you own a home and<br>it's a lot harder to do and if we<br>believe that home ownership is important<br>it's rare to find any politician who<br>would get up and say I don't think home<br>ownership's important and so if we<br>believe that then we had permissive<br>immigration restricted land use Supply<br>we could have been permissive and<br>permissive so Texas for example<br>permissive immigration permissive land<br>Supply and it manages to keep housing<br>prices at about three times incomes we<br>could have been really restrictive on<br>both perhaps Japan really hard to move<br>to and settle in Japan really hard to<br>release land but we had a particular<br>combination for weather luck or or not<br>uh which gave us what is essentially a<br>really large housing crisis which then<br>moves into a migration crisis because of<br>young new zealanders don't think they're<br>going to own a house then Australia<br>suddenly looks quite a lot more<br>attractive<br>thank you very much for uh those<br>comments from each of our three<br>panelists we've got lots of questions<br>that are coming through on the slido app<br>and of course it's a very rich<br>conversation with um with a range of<br>different insights that we can drill<br>into here if people have got questions<br>from the floor please do raise your hand<br>and we'll get a mic brought out for you<br>and I'll watch out for anyone waving if<br>you can give me a little wave too to let<br>me know that'd be good but I'm going to<br>start with a question that's come<br>through from online and perhaps I'll<br>address it Rachel to to you to begin<br>with but um both of the Johns may want<br>to to chip in as well particularly on<br>the healthcare aspect we've seen this<br>tightening in these changes in<br>the question is is it time for a<br>national conversation on what the ideal<br>setting should be and how would you see<br>us moving forward best on changing<br>immigration settings I guess more the<br>structure of those settings and the<br>precise nature of those settings so how<br>do we get the structure of those savings<br>improved yeah absolutely and I think<br>it's time to have that discussion<br>um and<br>luckily in an election year and these<br>discussions frequently come up so<br>um the settings around New Zealand's<br>immigration policy I mean we have some<br>natural advantages we're a small island<br>at the bottom of the world so actually<br>we we control our immigration flows<br>through our policy settings<br>um now I think you know part of the<br>heart of the argument and why it's good<br>to do disagree with our colleagues as a<br>uh I'd be interested in your thoughts<br>for example around where monetary policy<br>sits in our housing market and and those<br>kind of factors as well<br>um I think that touching on what are the<br>policies that are that are going to work<br>we do need to keep in mind that there<br>are people at the end of this policy<br>system<br>um what we see in touching on your<br>comments about increased disability in<br>the workforce is we're seeing Workforce<br>that's burnt out because they're working<br>more hours they're working harder just<br>to try and keep their heads above water<br>it's incredibly challenging right now to<br>be a small business owner in New Zealand<br>and the line from The Horizon was um was<br>coming out of covert and actually now<br>we've got a whole bunch of other other<br>challenges now part of the relief of<br>that is allowing people in in bringing<br>those skills in and reconnecting with<br>the world so I think that discussion<br>will happen this year in in an election<br>year<br>um<br>trying to move that to a sensible<br>long-term immigration discussion in a<br>away from what is often a polarizing<br>discussion is I think one of the really<br>big challenges but we have a wealth of<br>evidence and information out there about<br>immigration I think obviously we can<br>have the spirit of debate and the<br>ability to to uh to thresh these things<br>out<br>but we do need to keep in mind that the<br>people on the other end of this<br>including those who choose to contribute<br>to New Zealand and bring their<br>international skills here we haven't<br>always treated them very nicely and part<br>of the answer to this is making sure<br>that our immigration system is effective<br>it's efficient it's predictable<br>and ideally not subject to change every<br>three years<br>thanks John did you want to add anything<br>on the health implications I I from my<br>perspective I think um Nicolette has<br>done it before I think it's an and<br>um you know from a Workforce perspective<br>we need to train more we need to<br>increase our productivity because I<br>think some of the training that we<br>deliver from an industry perspective<br>doesn't deliver productivity it's<br>delivering a product that's misaligned<br>with what the industry is needing so<br>that's um one kind of component to it<br>but I also think there's a bigger kind<br>of discussion that needs to be had about<br>the commander control kind of piece you<br>know the role of government in this<br>about should it be all about control and<br>flicking levers or should it be about<br>empowerment to allow industry uh to get<br>on with innovating because often it<br>feels so hard to innovate uh you know<br>examples of bringing an alternative<br>clinicians or others to complement the<br>more traditional you can't get them<br>registered you know you've got colleges<br>you've got professional bodies and you<br>you also have government who get quite<br>confronted with that but I think also<br>really importantly it's the models in<br>which we run our traditional health<br>system on um you know covert was often<br>talked about as a way of digitalizing<br>and moving here out of a out of a room<br>with a clinician and moving some of it<br>online<br>but what we've seen is that shrunk back<br>or you know roared back to the more<br>traditional approach much more quickly<br>than people thought it was going to<br>happen but look what we find that we we<br>have new zealanders who are registered<br>who work for us and the company I work<br>for now who live all over the world<br>um and they're great because they can<br>work for us in the middle of their night<br>which is the middle of our day or vice<br>versa and that's that's that's<br>um provides uh different um options for<br>them uh we have people who say well<br>actually over winter I want to do<br>cross-country skiing and I want to live<br>in Wanaka but I still want to be a<br>doctor for the community that I am we<br>allow them to live in in Wanaka do the<br>cross-country skiing in the morning have<br>a wee nap and then work for us from two<br>to eight online but the public system<br>doesn't kind of behave like that it's<br>very traditional in the sense that you<br>come to work<br>um you know we have these shifts and<br>it's all very facility based which is<br>also really Capital intense so I think<br>there needs to be a bigger debate about<br>uh what are what do our modern Public<br>Health Services look like and how can we<br>ensure that we've got a Workforce<br>available to us through both the<br>training systems and skin games but also<br>that we can import and bring in through<br>immigration to to create greater<br>productivity I mean it's such an<br>interesting point isn't it because we<br>think covert had sped up so many trends<br>that we'd been seeing across all sorts<br>of economies worldwide and of course<br>moving things online was one of those<br>things that was starting to happen<br>before covert and covert sped it up so<br>in healthcare it's a really interesting<br>situation where you might have that<br>possibility to substitute online<br>services in some cases is for in-person<br>services or indeed in the example you<br>gave complementary because there's<br>people who are willing to look overnight<br>and and view scans or whatever it is<br>overnight and feedback that information<br>sorry Rachel did you were you waiting to<br>jump in there oh no just to actually<br>wildly agree for once yeah as you're<br>saying it's a nand end right yeah we<br>need to look at immigration I agree with<br>you we need to think about the training<br>system and uh you know we have seen some<br>really big ships in that over the last<br>couple of years in terms of the number<br>of apprenticeships that have come into<br>the system so our pipeline and at the<br>moment is actually looking more positive<br>than it has for a number of years but<br>um and we also need good active life<br>Market policies in terms of thinking<br>about how do you how do you help get<br>people into work<br>and if I can make one other comment one<br>of my other jobs as I chair one of New<br>Zealand's largest private schools and we<br>are full it's literally enroll your<br>child with a midwife<br>um to get in and I think that's<br>reflective also of concern of you know<br>what the education system is delivering<br>um to some new zealanders or not<br>delivering and you know why you know we<br>we thought well some of this is driven<br>by covert people's choices have changed<br>they're choosing to invest in um earlier<br>education in a different kind of way but<br>those Trends are not buttoning off<br>um in fact the demand seems to be going<br>the other way so it goes back to your<br>point um around productivity we need<br>greater productivity across a lot of our<br>public services so how does government<br>facilitate that without overcooking it<br>and then we need to be able to enable<br>other Industries to get on with that so<br>get out of it enable it<br>um in a really different way which is<br>really similar to I think some of the<br>discussions that were coming up this<br>morning<br>just just one one small point on uh the<br>issue as to the control we have yes as<br>you know said we've got a we've got a<br>huge moat so it's a long way to swim so<br>we don't have major problems of illegals<br>but it's not as easily controllable as<br>as might first be seen unless we're<br>going to return to the uh frankly<br>shameful circumstances where New Zealand<br>citizens were not able to return and it<br>took grounded kiwis to you know take the<br>government to court and so forth because<br>we've got you know close to a million<br>new zealanders who have the right to<br>return who are living overseas I've<br>forgotten Jack poeters right here he<br>might remind me there was a paper from<br>Motu which I think argued it was the<br>returning new zealanders who were<br>putting more impact on house prices than<br>the than the the brand new migrants and<br>on the other end with the trans-tasman<br>travel Arrangement then also we have uh<br>considerable fluidity across there and<br>similarly Australia cannot really run an<br>independent migration policy at least<br>with respect to the Pacific Islanders so<br>there's far more Polynesians in<br>Australia than we're would be expected<br>when we would expect more melanesians<br>given Australia's closeness and that<br>because partly because Australia doesn't<br>have control once once well under<br>current Visa settings at least once<br>people establish New Zealand citizenship<br>then they've got free rights have moved<br>there so it's actually not quite as as<br>easy for some Central policy maker to<br>you know turn the wheel a little bit<br>this and this because people have a lot<br>of freedoms or and a rights well again<br>unless we are going to abrogate those<br>rights as happened in the past which<br>hopefully we don't ever see again<br>and quite a few of those comments from<br>from our panelists actually touched on<br>some of the questions that are coming<br>through in terms of things like<br>regulation and also the macro impacts of<br>of immigration so we'll hopefully we'll<br>we'll get to some of those as well but<br>just a little bit of a follow-up<br>question on is this immigration settings<br>I mean do we really need to focus on<br>skilled or unskilled I mean we've got<br>the telecommuters but we've also got a<br>lot of Need for unskilled workers um and<br>I think some of the the scenes around<br>the country in in recent weeks is really<br>reminded us of the importance of having<br>a lot of unskilled labor available to<br>assist with all of those sorts of things<br>so<br>um John peps we'll start with you on on<br>this one<br>um okay so so very quickly over for over<br>a decade um a colleague a New Zealander<br>at the World Bank in Washington DC and I<br>uh looked at basically three parts of<br>the Pacific to New Zealand migration so<br>highly skilled people uh and new<br>zealanders going people coming from the<br>Pacific coming people chosen by random<br>ballot which solves a lot of technical<br>issues there's a specific access code<br>motor and some Oakwood and then the uh<br>recognized seasonal employment uh RSE<br>workers who many people call unskilled I<br>wouldn't call it unskilled it's skilled<br>in a particular way and I think it's<br>work that the vast majority of us would<br>not like did I grew up on a farm I know<br>a few people grew up on farms nearby and<br>it's really hard work and indeed we saw<br>that return workers had a premium so<br>there was some skill component and<br>employers wanted to get them and what we<br>find is that<br>um<br>they tend to be complementary so if if<br>you attract skill if you've got a let's<br>say a point space system which is trying<br>to attract skilled workers well that<br>actually creates the demand also for for<br>Less skilled Walkers people with less<br>formal skills in it and so again the<br>sort of ability that we can we can fine<br>tune and we can just turn up this dial a<br>little bit and this one down a little<br>bit I think is is a bit misleading um<br>people have a desire for Freedom people<br>have a desire to see their own<br>circumstances and their children's<br>circumstances improve and they will move<br>when the constraints are restricted when<br>the constraints are removed to do that<br>and so we see that but I do think we can<br>learn something from from looking at<br>some of the persevering countries if you<br>know that you're going to have a very<br>mobile population then it changes some<br>of the settings you may not want to have<br>a tax base which is highly reliant on a<br>very narrow mobile group of the<br>population because you you you you you<br>pluck the pluck the goose too much and<br>the goose is going to go somewhere else<br>and so um you might want to have a<br>pretty broad base tax you might want to<br>be based on the assumption that people<br>might be sending remittances we don't<br>know how much people send remittances to<br>New Zealand new zealanders who have been<br>successful gone overseas earning a lot<br>of money and what we were showing is<br>that for the skilled people there was a<br>frontier of about a hundred thousand us<br>per year wasn't didn't matter if you're<br>coming from the Pacific to New Zealand<br>going from New Zealand to Europe or<br>Australia or to the US highly skilled<br>people were basically those who chose to<br>return or come back we're leaving that<br>much on the table and the things which<br>were causing them do it were again<br>almost nothing that governments could<br>alter it was desire to see um elderly<br>parents desire for children to have the<br>experience that these adults themselves<br>had when they were children and almost<br>none of it was the little you know<br>um fine-tuning that that government<br>immigration departments might try to do<br>to incentivize them to come back or<br>something which is which is perhaps a<br>little bit too nihilistic<br>um but you've just got to make it a nice<br>a nice place to live in a sense and<br>allow people to then sort and settle so<br>yeah<br>I<br>I Guild and it's an unfortunate yeah is<br>agriculture often you know in the<br>international data sets unskilled<br>generally go into the agricultural<br>sector but I don't know that that's at<br>all the case for our city no and this<br>has been a very ongoing argument in<br>sectors like aged care for example and<br>the carers who come in who I think do an<br>amazing job<br>um I think that we do need to look at<br>our immigration system and totality and<br>we need to take a broader view of this<br>stuff because it's not just work visas<br>that come into the country it's<br>investors it's entrepreneurs and<br>obviously the family connections which<br>has been a massive driver<br>um what we do need is Visa labor market<br>data to be able to understand how that<br>stuff is Shifting and to understand are<br>we actually<br>utilizing the skills as effectively as<br>we can because as much as we talk about<br>immigration<br>um yeah we don't talk as much about<br>occupational licensing and how do we<br>accelerate that process because you<br>could get your visa and wait another 10<br>months to still get into the country we<br>don't talk about recognition of<br>international qualifications very<br>it's another big bit of the system and<br>how do we recognize prior learning and<br>the skills that come to the country that<br>maybe don't come from a country where we<br>recognize their qualification so there's<br>a lot that we can do in terms of<br>thinking about that broader View and<br>getting the planning right I think is<br>critically important<br>um because if you think about the<br>critical workers for example<br>um who who are at the front line during<br>covert Supermarket workers making sure<br>that we all had toilet paper those<br>people wouldn't get through our<br>immigration settings now we gave them<br>residency the The Residency Visa 2021<br>and the forecast on that was it would be<br>65 000 people it's turned out to be 209<br>000. so you know we've we've got to be a<br>lot sharper at being able to understand<br>what the shifts in the labor market are<br>doing and provide the flexibility and<br>Agility in that labor market for<br>companies to respond<br>and thanks also for that that point<br>distinguishing between skilled and<br>unskilled it's an unfortunate<br>categorization and I guess in in your<br>sector as well you see this John you'd<br>probably think of lower skilled and<br>higher skilled than unskilled and and<br>skilled wouldn't you partially but I<br>think you know we've got some really sad<br>stories of the de-skilling that the<br>legislation does so you know I think of<br>one clinic in central Auckland that<br>we've got we've got seven foreign<br>trained doctors whose qualifications are<br>not recognized in New Zealand and so the<br>operating as Health Center assistance on<br>28 an hour now<br>um<br>that's that's not right uh they're the<br>most incredibly you know a couple of<br>them are Specialists they're not not<br>just generalists<br>um and the way that our system is<br>configured there's just not enough<br>positions in the dhbs or the hospitals<br>to put them through the the kind of<br>catch-up kind of training program so you<br>often hear about the taxi drivers or the<br>others that are kind of sitting there<br>these people have made the choice to<br>come to New Zealand they've come with<br>families they've come with partners and<br>they're contributing and yet we are kind<br>of constraining the level of<br>contribution they can make because of<br>Bureau bureaucratic process and I you<br>know that that struggle with the other<br>comment I'll make is you know we've got<br>to remember demographics and all of this<br>I can't remember the actual figure so I<br>don't want to make it up but the the<br>number of 85 year olds is is is doubling<br>at a rate that it's never doubled at<br>before and with that comes a significant<br>increase in the in the type of<br>um care that we need to provide to keep<br>people at home uh with their family<br>funnel out of out of hospitals<br>um and we don't and can't find that<br>Workforce either and if you look at a<br>community like giraffity I know looking<br>at our health stats and uh sorry our<br>demographic stats on there you know it<br>swung for the first time ever the the<br>smallest portion of the population is<br>the working age group and young people<br>and retirees<br>um you know make up uh the bulk of the<br>population so from an economic from a<br>Workforce from a whole lot of<br>perspective it just doesn't work anymore<br>so you know how do we stack that up and<br>how do we make sure throw on top of that<br>a cyclone and um you crash a whole lot<br>of the economic contributors into that<br>as well it just seems complex so there's<br>lots of discussion I think we need to<br>have here isn't it and those regulatory<br>issues and these sorts of things would<br>also impact other sectors now some of<br>the issues that you talked about are<br>quite specific to the health sector but<br>I wonder when we're thinking about these<br>settings how much we can do at a general<br>level and how much has to be done at<br>that sectoral level John you know and<br>what I guess the question is in what<br>sense are the constraints<br>peculiar to the health sector<br>differentiated from other sectors and to<br>to what extent are those constraints and<br>the potential Solutions which I hope you<br>might um provide a couple of brief<br>insights on<br>um to what extent would they be specific<br>to the housing sector or more<br>generalizable yeah and and I think if<br>you take it back to the education sector<br>I think there's other interesting things<br>starting to occur there now I'm sitting<br>in a university I've got a couple of<br>degrees from here but<br>um actually micro credentialing online<br>through the likes AWS and Microsoft are<br>probably going to give young people<br>quicker and better earning kind of<br>outcomes in the short term than the<br>traditional path of going through a<br>tertiary education now I say that and<br>there's a kind of shiver I think because<br>the traditional model of what education<br>should and look like but if you think<br>about the capital cost and stuff that we<br>have caught up in this whereas we could<br>be fast tracking productivity into the<br>system using um you know some of those<br>other opportunities you know how do we<br>adapt which I think was a theme that<br>came through this morning as well<br>thanks I think we've got a question from<br>the floor is there ah yeah thank you<br>Naomi pocock University of wakato uh<br>just taking it back to the stage of the<br>labor market I'm interested in if any of<br>you have a comment on abatement rates on<br>beneficiaries which<br>disincentivizes work past about six to<br>foreign<br>I see a couple of people here who are<br>currently or formally in the treasury uh<br>who I think it the the interface between<br>between the benefit system and and<br>Market work and that is devilishly<br>complex uh is all I'll say<br>um and so I I don't I'm not going to<br>give you an answer I'm going to<br>Sidetrack it but but that's the sort of<br>thing which which treasury has experts<br>on in terms of abatements<br>um and yes we know the problem the<br>problem is that people can be trapped<br>okay it can be the case that uh things<br>to to which in other circumstances would<br>make someone uh better off by working<br>more hours or something like that can<br>actually make them worse off and and the<br>designers and the implementers<br>understand that but there is no there is<br>no perfect benefit system<br>um that's been yet developed for dealing<br>with that<br>uh<br>you can keep commenting we'll get the<br>microphone over to the front please go<br>ahead Rachel no I was just going to say<br>the the uh I touched on active labor<br>market programs in terms of the<br>abatement rates is something that would<br>need to be looked at within that context<br>because we do know that uh there are a<br>number of barriers to work for people<br>that has nothing to do with the jobs not<br>being available so the question is what<br>is the social interventions that you you<br>wrap around that that enables people to<br>be able to step into that and what is<br>effective<br>um and no country gets the active labor<br>market policy stuff right but things<br>like things like apprenticeships that<br>allow people to to take on skills as<br>they enter the workforce and making sure<br>there's a balance there in terms of the<br>other factors that make it accessible as<br>we just got a slight word on demography<br>I mean I'm amazed that we can talk about<br>immigration and population and don't<br>talk about the massive change that's<br>occurring with demography in other words<br>pure babies have been born and we've got<br>a very aging societies just about this<br>whole room will be on the pension in 20<br>years<br>but I mean that's reality we're going to<br>double the number over 65.<br>nobody's doing any work to say we can<br>afford that<br>and that's the brightnessable bastards<br>like me taking the age at up to 65 from<br>60 which was considered a disaster I<br>mean what we have to really concentrate<br>I encourage our panel is to what's the<br>impact of demography this very rapidly<br>declining birth rate really across the<br>world but we're just talking about New<br>Zealand and occasionally you'll see an<br>article about China but it's not China<br>China certainly has that problem we're<br>at large Japan's even further advice but<br>we're there now and this has enormous<br>implications for immigration policy and<br>Workforce and where they kind of come<br>from<br>thanks for that and maybe I'll also wrap<br>in a question there's quite a few<br>questions coming through on New<br>Zealand's International competitiveness<br>and that has that ties in with this<br>demography issue so perhaps a panelist<br>would like to um respond to the the<br>question and also on competitiveness<br>um well very very I'm going to be in<br>South Korea next month which has the<br>world's lowest it's 0.78<br>um<br>live births per per<br>um fertile woman of except exactly how<br>the definition is<br>um so so the Hope in some other<br>countries and I don't know if that's the<br>case in New Zealand or not is<br>robotization uh obviously it is is<br>immigrants too but people are competing<br>for the same same pool of immigrants<br>um the other aspect of it though too is<br>it's not homogeneous and so if we divide<br>this by ethnic group then we see vast<br>differences in not only age structure<br>but related to age structure fertility<br>and so it's also changing the<br>composition of countries as well<br>um dramatically and again which requires<br>you know program more adult<br>conversations than have been done to<br>date see ya<br>I'll just say I completely agree the<br>demographics of our country is a massive<br>Challenge and we've got to pretty<br>quickly grapple with with how it's going<br>to look and how we're going to pay for<br>it um I think when you look at the<br>outbound flows it is Young skilled new<br>zealanders that leave when you look at<br>our inbound foes by and large it is<br>working age population<br>and part of what we need to look at<br>within the immigration discussion is how<br>we welcome families now there's a<br>there's a policy change coming into<br>effect shortly which will work test<br>Partners<br>um which I think will will have a bit of<br>a chilling effect on on families that<br>want to come and contribute to New<br>Zealand and settle and that's what we<br>need to be honest<br>I I absolutely agree<br>um it's a massive Challenge and I think<br>the other thing that we need to think<br>about is that the evidence is really<br>clear that outside of you know<br>procedural work having your hip replaced<br>or your knee replaced uh in healthcare<br>you get much better outcome if you<br>receive health support from someone<br>similar to yourself so the other thing<br>that we need to really consider is that<br>our ethnic mixes can is changing<br>considerably across New Zealand and so<br>you know if you look at Auckland uh you<br>look at a large urban area or you look<br>at the regions<br>um what we have today is not what's<br>going to be there tomorrow so when it<br>comes to Workforce and immigration and<br>productivity and building capability we<br>need to keep that in the back of our<br>mind particularly from a health<br>perspective<br>um you respond better to someone you<br>feel comfortable with and you feel like<br>you can establish a relationship with<br>and that's not what our health Workforce<br>looks like the health workers will be<br>have today is not right for the<br>population that's emerging for New<br>Zealand for tomorrow so that's an<br>additional kind of challenge that we<br>need to kind of build in there and how<br>do we train for that you know that's a<br>local local partially a local thing but<br>it's also recognizing that immigration<br>is changing the the ethnic mix as well<br>so<br>um yeah lots in there thanks and we had<br>lots of questions I'm sorry we are going<br>to have to stop the questions now<br>because we're out of time but we've got<br>lots of questions also on International<br>Education that I would love to ask<br>because we're leading into the next<br>panel which of course is focusing on<br>education but I do encourage people<br>during the break which we'll have<br>afterwards to pick up those<br>conversations thank you so much to our<br>panelists for those rich and diverse<br>insights into immigration and Associated<br>issues</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
