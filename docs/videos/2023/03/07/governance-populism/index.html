us have been particularly<br>looking forward to of course<br>it's got a focus on governance and<br>populism<br>particularly the implications of<br>democracy in a digital age we've got<br>four speakers our first speakers will be<br>Professor Al Gillespie he is here at the<br>law school of the University of waikato<br>our second speaker is Josie Pagani Josie<br>is a public affairs consultant and a<br>media commentator Pagani agency<br>our third speaker is Ben Goran he is<br>based in London so there he is<br>morning or evening or whatever it is for<br>you Ben<br>and our fourth speaker was Patrick we<br>knew that there was a little bit of a<br>risk with his flight so we did Place him<br>at the end of the panel but it was a bit<br>more of a risk than we'd anticipated and<br>of course Patrick is joining us by Zoom<br>as well so with that welcome to the<br>panelists very excited to hear what what<br>insights they're going to bring and<br>please do store up your questions as<br>well because we will take questions from<br>the floor and from slido following the<br>initial remarks of up to five minutes<br>each<br>I'm going to just speak for five minutes<br>about the the international environment<br>that we're currently in and it's I've<br>been thinking a lot about it lately but<br>the person I really miss right now is<br>Monica Lewinsky<br>and that's um that's an age-appropriate<br>joke but there was there wasn't a time<br>when<br>international issues were about the<br>mistakes of a president and we were in a<br>utopian point where we thought<br>everything was getting better and had I<br>gone to someone who had a crystal ball<br>at that time and said what what's the<br>future hold and they said well there's a<br>global pandemic there's<br>um<br>there's there's a war on terror<br>there's terrorism in New Zealand I say I<br>want my money back I don't believe it<br>this can't be true and I was trying to<br>explain this to my students the other<br>day that there's been certain points<br>where everything changed and I said like<br>one of them was September the 11th 2001.<br>it's one of those days you will always<br>remember where you were<br>and they looked at me and I couldn't<br>work out what was going on until I<br>realized that half of them hadn't been<br>born<br>and and the world has changed so much in<br>this time and then when you get to the<br>point where we are today and the major<br>concern I have is the unsustainable<br>nature of the war in the Ukraine because<br>what we're seeing is over one year is a<br>continual escalation<br>Putin is not going to run out of bullets<br>he is not going to run out of money but<br>what he may run out of is men he has now<br>lost over 100 000 soldiers and the<br>problem that Putin faces is what the<br>Americans faced in Vietnam if the<br>Russian wives and the Russian mothers<br>love their children as much as the<br>Americans did then the greatest enemy is<br>not the external one it's the internal<br>one and this means that there will be<br>pressure for him to do something<br>different<br>we're at a point where International<br>arms control and security control is in<br>free fall we have lost nine major<br>agreements since 2001. not all of it is<br>the Russian fault some of it is the<br>American fault some of the mistakes that<br>were made were learned by each other<br>but right now you're in a point which is<br>very similar to the Spanish Civil War<br>where the Ukraine has become a proxy<br>Battleground between two sides<br>this is not just a military risk it is<br>an economic risk because what you're<br>seeing is a move back to<br>self-sufficiency globalization is<br>beginning to fracture and for Temptation<br>for countries to act in a unilateral<br>manner is unprecedented in the last 20<br>years<br>the big thing that's changed recently is<br>that China is now on the cusp and that<br>remarkable panda bear has done an<br>incredible job balancing on a very thin<br>wall for one year over which way it's<br>going to go but discussion now is<br>whether China will become a non-neutral<br>state and start providing weapons to<br>Russia<br>the only restraint on China is the arms<br>trade treaty and American pressure the<br>arms trade treaty says you cannot<br>provide weapons to a country if it's<br>going to undermine peace and security or<br>cause crimes against humanity<br>The Tipping Point is China at the same<br>point has now put on a peace proposal<br>onto the table last night they've called<br>for a ceasefire on the major belligerent<br>involved in the conflict<br>my expectation is that if the peace plan<br>of China does not succeed then you will<br>see them move to a non-neutral position<br>which would be very similar to where New<br>Zealand is right now<br>the challenge that creates for us is<br>huge because the United States will have<br>two options option one you will increase<br>the flow of material and support for the<br>Ukraine option two you sanction China in<br>a much more direct way than we currently<br>have and if this happened they would<br>expect us to behave in a like-minded way<br>here's the good news the Chinese peace<br>proposal the 12 points is a good idea<br>it's better than the Russian approach<br>the Russians don't do peace proposals<br>the Russians expect their opponents to<br>surrender you can think of Georgia you<br>can think of chechnya you can think of<br>Syria they don't normally negotiate<br>there's Hawks on the west and the Hawks<br>on the west want Russia completely out<br>of the Ukraine they want criminals to be<br>brought to account they want restoration<br>and there's no middle ground there<br>zielinski put up his peace plan at the<br>end of last year and the Chinese peace<br>plan is quite similar<br>the good thing is that they support<br>territorial Integrity the role of the<br>United Nations and the importance of<br>international law<br>they're calling for a rethink on<br>military alliances like with NATO and<br>we've done this once before we did this<br>in 1991 we built up that framework and<br>we can do it again<br>but where it's Unique is that the<br>Chinese have said we've got to focus<br>more on unilateral sanctions and the<br>importance of Global Supply chains and<br>this is their concern because they're<br>worried that the international market is<br>no longer stable<br>so<br>to put it into some kind of context<br>where does this mean that we go now as a<br>country I've got three suggestions that<br>I think are worthy of debate first thing<br>give peace a chance if the Chinese have<br>put up a peace proposal on the table<br>it's not perfect there's a long way to<br>go but we need to be supportive of any<br>efforts to try to get away out of this<br>unsustainable War<br>two what do we do with the Ukraine first<br>keep up the good diplomatic work support<br>international law that is working<br>we need to consider also to do more with<br>regards to refugees and I would argue<br>that New Zealand has a particular<br>responsibility for any conflict which we<br>are involved in and this is above and<br>beyond our normal ethical<br>responsibilities three keep providing<br>military assistance and that at the<br>moment we are disproportionate to what<br>we give compared to our friends and<br>allies we don't have the same Tech when<br>they have discussions about tanks and<br>fighter planes we just look kind of<br>blank because we can't do that but we<br>can do certain things with like armored<br>vehicles and we can listen to what they<br>need the main thing they need is money<br>and it's important to support them and<br>then we have to think about us and this<br>is where it gets really hard because<br>it's not just the Ukraine we have to<br>think about our alliances we are facing<br>once in a generation questions right now<br>these are things that we went to sleep<br>in 1991 and we thought we were going to<br>live happily ever after and Monica<br>Lewinsky was where it was going to be<br>but now we've woken up and the world is<br>different we have to think about what we<br>stand for and who we stand with anzus is<br>Frozen it's not dead it's frozen<br>but the problem we have is that it's not<br>anzas we wouldn't fight for America but<br>we would fight for Australia and we are<br>linked by a treaty in 1944 if Australia<br>gets into a fight we get into a fight<br>but we have to think where do we sit<br>what do we stand for second thing how<br>much are we going to spend<br>right now there's an arms race in the<br>world going on we spend 1.5 percent of<br>our GDP on the military the NATO average<br>is now two percent and it's escalating<br>this is a difficult choice because every<br>dollar you spend has got opportunity<br>cost and so if you spend a dollar on a<br>frigate that's a dollar that's not going<br>to be spent on social housing<br>but we have to start working out are we<br>going to pay more<br>three we have to think about the types<br>of the military that we have Warfare in<br>the future as you can see in the Ukraine<br>is not what it was in the 20th century<br>the technology has changed it's<br>artificial intelligence it's Hypersonic<br>it's a completely different platform if<br>we're going to send our woman and our<br>men and the New Zealand military forces<br>into any combat zone they need to have<br>the best equipment<br>this all comes down to one large<br>question it's about our identity do we<br>see ourselves as a regional police<br>officer or do we see ourselves as part<br>of a much larger deterrent against a<br>emerging Force which may need to be<br>confronted<br>that's it thank you very much Al wow<br>right bleak<br>but interesting I'm going to make a<br>prediction about the future of liberal<br>democracies like ours which is a<br>complete Fool's game I know<br>um and in fact as I was coming here this<br>morning I found an anecdote which<br>perfectly<br>illustrates the um Fool's game of trying<br>to do forecasts Noble Laureate Economist<br>Kenneth Arrow I'm sure many of you know<br>in the second world war<br>um he he was given a a duty as a weather<br>forecaster for the U.S army this is<br>during World War II He was ordered to<br>evaluate the mathematical models for<br>predicting the weather a month in<br>advance found out that they were<br>completely useless informed of this his<br>superiors sent back another order the<br>Commanding General is well aware that<br>the forecasts are no good however he<br>needs them for his planning<br>so yeah what I'm about to say may be<br>completely useless and ill-informed but<br>um<br>here goes my my experience uh I guess is<br>is across working in politics working<br>for Global think tanks Global progress<br>Tony Blair Institute and others and also<br>doing media commentary as well I'm<br>working in Aid in development in the<br>Pacific in particular<br>um and I think liberal democracy is in<br>real trouble uh the last couple of years<br>we've seen I think the the worst drop in<br>the lowest levels of democracy seen in<br>30 years so there are fewer democracies<br>and fewer Democratic processes within<br>countries we may well have lived through<br>the end of a brief interlude in history<br>of liberal democracy and and of the<br>Rises of democracies and<br>anti-colonialism that we've seen since<br>the second world war in the second half<br>of this of the 20th century defined the<br>second half of that Century its collapse<br>could be the defining trend of the 21st<br>century I think we're in real trouble<br>unless we fight back and and of course<br>I'm suggesting we fight back and and I'm<br>probably a little bit more muscular than<br>Al<br>um give peace a chance well uh you know<br>I look at Ukraine because where are the<br>attacks on liberal democracy coming from<br>let's start with Ukraine I look at<br>Ukraine and go well uh not no war in<br>Ukraine means no fighting for the<br>Russians it means no Ukraine for the<br>ukrainians and and let's be absolutely<br>clear that Putin was triggered not by an<br>expansion of NATO but by an expansion of<br>democracy so this is our fight and they<br>are us<br>and I and I look at what we've done well<br>first of all I look at the the Ukrainian<br>version of nationalism which is<br>amazingly hopeful actually in this fight<br>for Liberal democracy it's a very Civic<br>nationalism you know it's not ethnic<br>nationalism that the Ukrainian sense of<br>being Ukrainian<br>incorporates Russian speakers Ukrainian<br>speakers migrants it's a Civic kind of<br>nationalism which is wonderful and not<br>an ethnic nationalism and they take huge<br>pride in in fighting for the values that<br>we hold dear the L has outlined uh you<br>know tolerance liberal democracy<br>Democratic processes freedom of speech I<br>think it's appalling that the Russian<br>Ambassador is sitting in his comfortable<br>office in mazine Street in Wellington<br>with a yellow highlighter highlighting<br>the names of new zealanders who have<br>become enemies of the state of Russia<br>for for calling out and standing up for<br>Liberal democracy<br>so the second I suppose strand of this<br>debate is the is uh the attacks on<br>liberal values from populism the rise of<br>populist movements on the left and the<br>right<br>uh and we've talked yesterday the theme<br>that came through was this sort of<br>decline in the trust of Institutions the<br>trust of governments it's interesting we<br>talk about populism as if it's a bad<br>thing I mean the word populist I mean<br>some of the best uh changes in history<br>have been populist movements<br>anti-slavery Civil Rights Movement votes<br>for women these are all populist<br>movements you know polite people don't<br>change the world<br>so I think we have to look at the appeal<br>of populism rather than just going you<br>know this is a very negative thing what<br>are the what's the appeal the appeal is<br>that it's so optimistic it's optimistic<br>it promises transformation we're going<br>to make your life better you've been<br>left behind we're going to stand up for<br>you it's incredibly optimistic and we we<br>kind of don't recognize that when we're<br>so sort of uh terrified of the populist<br>movement<br>so what do we do about the negative rise<br>of of populism well I think we need to<br>move away from what I call the the<br>mingvas politicians we need fewer<br>mingvas politicians I.E politicians who<br>kind of you know behave like they're<br>walking on a polished floor holding a<br>Priceless mingvars and they're afraid of<br>you know dropping it you know we need<br>politicians who are prepared to take<br>risks who are you know on a moral<br>crusade to stand up for Liberal values<br>and I was trying to think what's the<br>opposite of a mingvas politician what do<br>I actually mean maybe it's a I don't<br>know politician with a tray of drinks<br>walking across a crowded Dance Floor you<br>know I want politicians like that and<br>these are the kinds of politicians I<br>think or and it doesn't have to be in<br>politics I mean you know political<br>leaders can come from all sorts of<br>centers of of power but take back the<br>optimism of populism promise the<br>transformation that populism promises<br>deliver more of a share of the economy<br>to people who feel left behind and<br>that's how you deal with optimism not<br>othering them not excommunicating people<br>and I think in New Zealand the left and<br>the right have made populism worse and<br>and the sort of nascent rise of it in<br>New Zealand those on the right need to<br>realize that yes free markets capitalism<br>have lifted more people out of poverty<br>than anything in history it's been a<br>huge success<br>but the rising tide didn't lift all<br>boats some sank and no one in a small<br>New Zealand Town said well I've lost my<br>job but at least aggregate wages have<br>gone up<br>so the right has to have something to<br>say about inequality it's a little bit<br>like only Nixon could go to China I mean<br>you imagine of Tomorrow Christopher<br>luxon gets up and talks about inequality<br>uses the word even and God forbid even<br>redistribution<br>and then on the left the left in New<br>Zealand need to stop trying to make us<br>better people and go back to trying to<br>make us better off<br>you know there's a there's a sort of<br>tilted head of compassion approach a<br>friend of mine in the UK once said Tony<br>Blair political advisor and he said you<br>know it used to be that people joined<br>the labor party to make their lives<br>better off in their Community now they<br>join the labor party to make somebody<br>else's life better off<br>so somehow that that diversity of voices<br>in our politics has gone and it's<br>leading to the kind of populism we're<br>seeing and how I would class that is<br>that we're divided now in our politics<br>between the knowledge class those who<br>who have knowledge capital and those who<br>have property and and wealth and own<br>houses and at the property class<br>um or if you like the Haves and the Have<br>yachts<br>what's missing in that division is the<br>rise that the strong voice of working<br>new zealanders of of working class new<br>zealanders and funnily enough it's only<br>middle class people who ask me to Define<br>working class but here's a stat because<br>Brad said if you can have a stat you'll<br>impress anybody so here's the state 40<br>of new zealanders have no Capital at all<br>so that's no tertiary<br>degrees or knowledge capital and no<br>property but Parliament over 90 percent<br>of people in Parliament have a tertiary<br>degree and have knowledge or property<br>and probably both so our politics has<br>become far less representative that has<br>to change and social media hasn't it<br>caused the populism that we're seeing in<br>the world today it's exacerbated it and<br>I and I look forward to talking more<br>about how we can manage that not by<br>Banning hate speech incidentally there<br>are other things we can do more<br>effectively but to finally end back to<br>Ukraine where um I agree with you Al<br>there's a lot more that we should and<br>could be doing what we've done is pretty<br>pathetic we've sanctioned oligarchs<br>associated with Putin which is a bit<br>like canceling a lunch date with you<br>know the cartel drug cartel it's like<br>it's the least we can do it's not happen<br>for lunch and I think new zealanders<br>have shown what it's like and often<br>again populist movement if you like New<br>Zealand has shown what it's like to<br>fight a muscular<br>optimistic<br>courageous fight for Liberal values and<br>principles and democracy when people<br>like myself and probably some of you in<br>this room were personally sanctioned by<br>Putin we did what any good fighting kiwi<br>should do our response was pretty<br>unified we basically said Russian<br>warship go yourself<br>so that's the kind of politics I think<br>we need to fight for Liberal democracy<br>thank you<br>there's some interesting and pretty deep<br>themes that are coming through already<br>so um we'll go straight over to you<br>though Ben if that's um okay and we'll<br>pick up the questions after you and<br>Patrick<br>brilliant thanks very much thank you<br>Alan Josie for giving us a you know<br>really interesting<br>um backdrop to this discussion by<br>looking at the international position<br>particularly with the war in Ukraine and<br>also the you know effect on now domestic<br>politics by factors like populism and<br>you know I think what's most interesting<br>about you know having a discussion like<br>this is thinking about where does it<br>come from and what's making it worse you<br>know the big question for me is what<br>impact is the rise and you know changes<br>in digital media consumption having on<br>our democracies and I say our<br>democracies because these things can<br>have quite different effects uh in New<br>Zealand to here in the UK to another<br>developing markets as well and that's<br>something that you know I think is<br>really interesting to talk about it's<br>also a really fascinating time to have<br>this discussion because over the last<br>few years there have been you know an<br>enormous number of um uh it's a really<br>healthy debates around the challenges of<br>fake news around hate speech the role of<br>Echo Chambers and in the way that our<br>personally curated media environments on<br>social media are so different to the<br>days of everyone getting their news from<br>newspapers TBN radio where we all had<br>pretty consistent news diets and we know<br>there's been so much research done into<br>this that when you have Echo Chambers on<br>social media that leads to polarization<br>it leads to radicalization and all the<br>negative effects that come with that and<br>so these factors have mainly come about<br>over the last few years by the rise of<br>follower-based platforms on social media<br>like Facebook like Twitter like<br>Instagram and on platforms like this the<br>people that you follow whether pages of<br>celebrities all your friends and family<br>dictate the type of news and content<br>that you get and that's some of the most<br>important factors that decide you know<br>how you see the content you see on these<br>platforms but what we've seen in the<br>last few years is the rise of tech talk<br>and the flow-on effect that's had on the<br>digital ecosystem increasingly the time<br>that people are spending online is with<br>platforms with a Content that they're<br>being shown isn't related to who they<br>follow it's related to their personal<br>preferences and algorithmic<br>recommendations based off what people or<br>your likely Trends and consumption<br>behaviors and this exacerbates a lot of<br>these challenges that we're talking<br>about in digital media and it also opens<br>up some new ones for example in a tick<br>tock have you know tried to win some new<br>press in the last few days by<br>introducing a 60-minute time limit on on<br>teenagers I mean you know for any<br>teenagers or parents or teenagers in the<br>room I mean good luck you know hoping<br>that that's going to be enough to you<br>know you know Tech talk addiction from<br>young people<br>well that comes into response to a lot<br>of criticism that tick tock's been<br>having around number one you know the<br>general addictive nature of their<br>product you know which which it is you<br>know more addictive than meth basically<br>but secondly is there are much broader<br>concerns with tech talk around the data<br>that they collect a lot of that debate<br>has been around people's personal data<br>being exposed to Tech talk that's why<br>it's been banned<br>um uh you know the app's been banned in<br>the US among Federal um federal<br>government employees there's been a<br>greater New Zealand around whether the<br>same could apply here but the real<br>challenge I think isn't just about the<br>Chinese government potentially having<br>access to your individual data the real<br>challenge is what the Chinese government<br>could have access to do with that data<br>at a really aggregate level because the<br>real Battleground on digital media over<br>the next decade isn't going to be about<br>tech talk or Instagram or Facebook it's<br>going to be about which AI platforms are<br>most pervasive and which in which<br>institutions are shaping those platforms<br>we've all already seen the rise of chat<br>GPT and other AI platforms that are<br>accessible to you know individuals and<br>businesses to help change the way we<br>work and communicate well the Chinese<br>government has access through the 2021<br>data security law to any corporate data<br>of any Chinese firm any firm operating<br>in China or Chinese firm operating<br>overseas that means they have access to<br>the largest potential data set into<br>human behavior what motivates us what<br>makes us watch things what makes us clip<br>things what sort of products do we like<br>to buy everything that we do within the<br>tech talk ecosystem has the risk of<br>being shaped into an AI that has you<br>know the Chinese government have access<br>to that's the really scary stuff that I<br>think we're going to be facing in the<br>coming years but back to the issues at<br>hand now because we've got more than<br>enough for now play there's a study<br>published in nature in 2021 that looked<br>at around 500 different studies into the<br>linkages between this is a meta study<br>between digital media and and and<br>democracy it pulled out a few factors it<br>said that digital media leads to<br>increased political participation and<br>increased information consumption and<br>these are widely accepted to be good<br>things it also pulled out that it leads<br>to declining trust and institutions that<br>Jose has spoken about increased populism<br>which is Jose as you said can be a good<br>or a bad thing and growing polarization<br>and these last three tend to be<br>detrimental especially in established<br>democracies<br>um and and you know I think there's um<br>there's a really interesting theme<br>coming through that in emerging<br>democracies the balance of the effective<br>digital media tends to be positive<br>because it puts more pressure on<br>authoritarian leaders it opens up<br>information for debate and it can be<br>really complementary to the news media<br>which is often a mature Rolex the<br>respect lets the networks and and sort<br>of trust to be able to take up through<br>but in established democracies digital<br>media can be a much greater threat<br>and that comes through in another study<br>that came out last year by Pew research<br>the 19 different countries and asked the<br>question do you think social media is a<br>Force for good or a force for bad and<br>overall 57 of the people in these<br>countries believed it was a Force for<br>good but in countries like the us there<br>was only 34 whereas in Poland and<br>Hungary and other emerging democracies<br>that number was Far higher at 65 percent<br>or higher what that tells us is that<br>when we talk about the effect between<br>digital media and democracy there are<br>very different stories playing out in<br>different corners of the globe and<br>that's something that we need to be<br>aware of it's not as binary as just<br>Facebook's bad or you know increasing<br>political participation is good it's a<br>nuanced discussion that is very<br>conditional on the context of where<br>we're talking and that's why I think<br>it's really interesting you know because<br>as you're saying about the populism<br>debate the rise of populism isn't just<br>down to digital media it's down to a<br>range of factors but it often cases is<br>replacing and the inability of Centrist<br>politicians to connect and deliver a<br>relatable message to to the public and<br>that shows that we've got a democracy<br>deficit that political leaders need to<br>step up to and find ways to get their<br>message to cut through and I'll end with<br>one example of this where we've done it<br>here in the UK which is you know the<br>question of brexit has been a polarizing<br>political deadlock in this country from<br>the referendum day up until up until you<br>know prison days and it led to a<br>stagnation in Parliament chaos and delay<br>as your legislation wasn't getting<br>through and it led to the collapse of<br>Theresa May's government<br>when Boris Johnson came in as as prime<br>minister and sort of was lumped the you<br>know rather sort of difficult task of<br>trying to get this whole brexit thing<br>out of the way it was yes a populist<br>message that helps to achieve that the<br>tagline of get brexit done<br>appealed to Broad Streets of the<br>population and led to a historic 80<br>majority for a very simple reason it<br>presented a unifying proposition to both<br>leave voters who wanted brexit to happen<br>but also people that didn't vote for<br>brexit at all that just wanted the<br>deadlock And Delay to be over with and<br>what that tells us is that there's an<br>opportunity to find Common Ground even<br>in a polarized political environment and<br>through using simple effective messaging<br>to cut through and these are the sorts<br>of things that can help improve the<br>state of our democracies but there's<br>plenty more work to be done and many<br>bigger challenges on the horizon cheers<br>thank you I'm coming to you from<br>Tauranga airport as you know with an<br>unstable internet connection so please<br>excuse me if there's any leg or a drop<br>out and up until recently I was age for<br>20 years most recently eight years as<br>the editorial editor-in-chief of Staff<br>last year I spent three months at<br>Cambridge University where I was<br>researching past an engine again so it's<br>particularly focused on news media but I<br>think a lot of what I learned was<br>broadly applicable Beyond journalism to<br>other mainstream institutions so I<br>approached today's topic<br>um from the point of view of media and<br>through a limb of stuff and I wanted to<br>make Four Points by way of uh opening<br>remarks the first point is that our<br>information ecosystem is unhealthy it's<br>an interesting London School of<br>Economics Report from a few years ago<br>that talks about five information evils<br>that are prevalent in our era confusion<br>cynicism fragmentation irresponsibility<br>and empathy and cumulatively they add up<br>to a situation where citizens often<br>aren't sure what's true we're consensus<br>and agreed facts are harder to come by<br>and where a lot of the power of the flow<br>of information is held by organizations<br>that lack ethics or accountability which<br>connects to the point they're being made<br>earlier about a big issue in the coming<br>decade being who controls those AI<br>platforms<br>um and also a situation where citizens<br>disengage with or lose faith in the<br>structures of society<br>point two is that trust matters for good<br>governance and it's absences it's<br>relevant to connected to a factor in the<br>have written about democracy requiring<br>vertical trust when the government<br>apparatus and the families are Governor<br>but also horizontal trust between the<br>people and society and that you need<br>both of those for democracy to function<br>in a robust and healthy way and that<br>when those trust links deteriorate in a<br>very significant consequences and that's<br>relevant because as I get it has been<br>discussed previously trust and keys<br>but<br>I take a slightly contrary view on trust<br>being in crisis because I also think<br>that the data tends to show that chronic<br>low trust is not any new thing<br>it might be something that we are uh<br>newly conscious of<br>um and that is more apparent with a the<br>flowering of the forces that has been<br>seen in digital media but trust in the<br>government and the politician and and<br>the media is actually perennially low in<br>my circumference<br>so point four is that that suggested to<br>me that it's while it's important to<br>address the health of our information<br>ecosystem that's not enough by itself<br>um and that we have to look at the<br>fundamentals of trust one of the things<br>from my research that really captured my<br>attention is that there are four traits<br>that are required for a robust trust<br>relationship to form you need competence<br>reliability integrity and benevolence so<br>that's like uh can you do the job<br>will you actually do the job will you<br>deal with me honestly and are you acting<br>in my best interests and if we look at<br>some of the disengage the disenfranchise<br>groups in our society and the events<br>that were significant to the<br>deterioration of trust solution you can<br>often see that from their point of view<br>there's been a failing in one or more of<br>those points<br>trust is hard to build hard to maintain<br>very easy to lose<br>um but public actors who want to<br>maintain trust you should actively shape<br>their behavior not just their their<br>messaging or the rhetoric but their<br>actual Behavior to demonstrate that<br>competence and reliability and integrity<br>thank you and I thank you thank you<br>thank you very much Patrick thank you<br>very much to all of our panelists for<br>those um starting comments those Rich<br>insights and and I'm looking forward to<br>questions please wave out if you've got<br>questions from the floor that you would<br>like to raise and we'll get a mic over<br>thank you I've got two points or two one<br>is I agree with Jerry that trust and<br>um politicians have always exaggerated<br>and they've always made the odd<br>misstatement now and again but we've<br>actually seen in Western democracies<br>politicians who have lied openly now<br>Donald Trump has declare example but<br>brexit was one on the basis of Lies and<br>those politicians are still in politics<br>now when you see speeches from Biden<br>even in an American they fact check the<br>speeches so it's become a fact that<br>people almost expected politicians to<br>lie and I think that is a big change we<br>we never we we sort of trusted<br>politicians to exaggerate but not to lie<br>but now they've been lying and that and<br>we shouldn't be surprised that people<br>have lost trust in their political<br>institutions the other institution you<br>you haven't mentioned uh that's quite<br>important is the legal system<br>um I've worked for a long time in<br>Eastern Europe where people don't trust<br>a legal system going to court is like<br>going to a casino you have no idea<br>what's going to happen it totally<br>changes the way people behave and what<br>the way business operates I think in New<br>Zealand we still basically have trust in<br>the legal system I would say I'd never<br>been to court but I was pretty confident<br>that if I did it would be fair it would<br>be relatively quick and the outcome<br>would be based on facts but in countries<br>where that doesn't exist you really have<br>a major problem<br>I'm going to suggest thanks for that I'm<br>going to suggest maybe Al if you want to<br>make some brief comments on legal system<br>and trusts and then uh Patrick you might<br>want to comment on trusts and Josie and<br>Ben if you want to afterwards I'm<br>suggesting that order thank you uh the<br>world Justice project does an analysis<br>every year of legal systems around the<br>world and it's an extensive collection<br>New Zealand comes in consistently for<br>the last three years at seventh the best<br>in the world and and we should be very<br>proud about this and to actually build a<br>system that has that kind of integrity<br>and robustness requires a lot of<br>legislation and a lot of trust in it as<br>well but but your pointer to create the<br>system is good in New Zealand the<br>challenge is maintaining it but that's<br>not just with the Judiciary that's also<br>with the police and ensuring that the<br>public and they generally do trust it<br>but that always requires having<br>independent oversight and having steps<br>available to make sure that when there<br>are mistakes made that they can be<br>up jumping<br>um I I at the record being too simpler<br>um I would also make the point that if<br>we're thinking about trust in a New<br>Zealand context we should look at the<br>New Zealand content and it's important<br>to not take too many cues from uh<br>overseas jurisdiction particularly<br>America America leans really large and<br>all sorts of conversations and political<br>discourse and international Affairs and<br>discussions about journalism and media<br>but America isn't a representative<br>example America is a unique case in in<br>almost all indexes of performance<br>America is a a real outlier and Trust in<br>the news in particular it's a real<br>outlier it's at the very bottom of<br>almost all of the countries surveys so<br>it certainly um possible that New<br>Zealand picked up Echoes of trends that<br>start in America but usually not when<br>you're in the air and pronounce<br>um as the phenomenon is happening in<br>America so I think we also have to be a<br>little bit cautious about looking at<br>those International examples and<br>assuming the same points hold through<br>New Zealand<br>thanks Patrick Joseph did you want to go<br>yeah I saw some uh data I think this<br>week maybe it's the one stuff you're<br>referring to Patrick of uh drop and<br>message drop and trust with media<br>globally and New Zealand wasn't in the<br>in the data but it's pretty alarming and<br>I think uh fukuyama describes the<br>institutions of liberal democracies as<br>as the canary in the mine that when you<br>when people start to lose trust in the<br>institutions whether it's the public<br>sector whether it's uh you know MB<br>whether it's Parliament whether it's<br>slick committees you know or whether<br>it's it's the apparatus of Courts and<br>the police and so on<br>um it's a quick step from that to losing<br>trust in the political system and then<br>trust in democracy and an alarming<br>statistic I came across last year uh<br>when I was in the UK the Tony Blair<br>Institute had done this data 30 of<br>British people that's 14 million by the<br>way would rather have a strong leader<br>who could get things done get brexit<br>done Ben then then go through a<br>parliamentary process of you know<br>processing slowing it down and getting<br>things like 14 million people in the UK<br>would rather bypass Parliament so I<br>think this is where I think we're in<br>real trouble that's salami I grew up in<br>England and<br>um that's that's pretty shocking data<br>the other thing I would say about<br>growing up in England too with brexit is<br>that um you know I went to a local state<br>school comprehensive school then I went<br>to University everyone I went to school<br>with very working class Community I grew<br>up including my brother all voted brexit<br>everyone I went to University with voted<br>remain and so again it comes to this<br>division in politics that if if we're if<br>we're simply saying that people we<br>disagree with parliamentary protests and<br>so I kind of we demonize them we're<br>going to end up with a growing lack of<br>trust I think in the institutions and<br>therefore in in democracy liberal<br>democracy generally and we we can't do<br>that we're too small country to<br>excommunicate people who start to lose<br>trust because we're related to half of<br>them unfortunately so<br>then was there anything that you wanted<br>to add in from your position in the UK<br>yeah look I think it's um it's really<br>easy to say oh gosh you know trust in<br>institutions is failing it's probably<br>social media's fault<br>um if people didn't face as much<br>everyone would all be happier but you<br>know what our political leaders globally<br>and our institutions have failed on many<br>issues we've failed to do enough about<br>climate change in New Zealand we've<br>failed to fix the housing crisis we've<br>failed to build the infrastructure that<br>we need we've failed on so many ways we<br>have for Generations unlike multiple<br>sides of politics it's a systematic<br>issue that does actually need to be<br>addressed my generation are the first<br>generation in a century who are going to<br>have a lower standard of living than<br>their parents my generation are less<br>likely to own their own homes we don't<br>expect our retirement savings to be<br>guaranteed by the government because we<br>just assume that the economy will be<br>completely by then and half of us have<br>depression because we think that the<br>world's going to burn to a crisp in 10<br>years like I exaggerate but these are<br>really serious issues and then you<br>wonder why we have low trusts and<br>institutions social media video sure it<br>doesn't help some aspects of this but<br>there are very real challenges that<br>haven't been addressed by our<br>institutions and our leaders that need<br>to be and until they are we're going to<br>see the situation getting worse but you<br>know what social media can and should be<br>part of the solution the survey I<br>mentioned earlier about a surveying 19<br>countries do you think social media is a<br>Force for good or bad for democracy and<br>every single country surveyed young<br>people believe that social media was a<br>positive factor for democracy it leads<br>to explaining things in ways that appeal<br>to young people it leads to building<br>communities and causes that young people<br>care about whether it's me too or<br>climate change or anything else and what<br>it tells us is that politicians<br>political institutions parliaments<br>libraries you know Ministries<br>journalists need to show up and do<br>prison on these platforms where people<br>are and with some fantastic work for<br>many in the media community and<br>journalists about being proactive on<br>social media and engaging you see<br>piecemeal exam samples from governments<br>around the world this is my challenge<br>like get out there and get on these<br>platforms where people are communicating<br>and start taking responsibility for the<br>issues that our political leaders need<br>to be dealing with<br>thanks Ben and that<br>um takes me nicely into a question that<br>I've got through from online the digital<br>world that we find ourselves in<br>currently is a huge challenge but also<br>an enabler and you've talked about some<br>of those enabling factors how can we<br>manage this tension to ensure that<br>democracy is able to thrive and you've<br>given us a few ideas there Ben so I<br>don't know if you'd like to start an ad<br>anymore before we turn to the other<br>panelists but how can we um yep how can<br>we make sure democracy look I think the<br>best place to start is to split out what<br>are actually some of the different<br>nuanced uh problems here because it's<br>very easy to lump everything into oh<br>that's a digital issue but if you look<br>at the things that you do on a day<br>everything's digital you know when<br>you're without your smartphone you know<br>every business that you interact with<br>has an online presence you know we<br>talked we heard earlier about<br>cryptocurrencies for the central bank<br>and what does it matter we pay for<br>everything with our phones anyway you<br>know if what we're doing is digital<br>explain to me what isn't digital so we<br>need to get better at using vocabulary<br>to break down the different types of<br>challenges that exist within the digital<br>media environment so we've got a few<br>right you know we've talked a lot about<br>trust and institutions some you know one<br>of the places we can start by doing that<br>is by institutions really putting in<br>more effort to turn up and communicate<br>and take action another issue is around<br>populism and populism represents a lack<br>of Engagement from political Leaders<br>with issues that people are concerned<br>about and there are all sorts of<br>structural vectors that are outside the<br>scope of this panel about why politics<br>is moving in different places but what<br>it means is that when there's a gap for<br>a populist movement that other political<br>leaders need to respond and actually<br>listen to what these people are getting<br>upset about you know when working class<br>voters in the midwest voted for Trump<br>they did so because they felt like the<br>Democratic party had left them behind on<br>values and policies that's why they<br>voted Trump right and so the you know<br>political leaders need to respond to<br>that so those are a couple of examples<br>of how you know we can actually by<br>splitting up these challenges respond to<br>them in separate ways a lot of people<br>say well actually if we just bend and<br>regulate ban or regulated these digital<br>platforms then our problems would go<br>away well it's not that simple you know<br>we it might be easier to say oh look<br>maybe we should just separate Facebook<br>apps so they don't own Facebook and<br>Instagram but the bigger threat out<br>there is Tick Tock and if you break that<br>up if you regulate that something else<br>will come along we actually need to take<br>responsibility as a society as<br>individuals and institutions for one<br>putting in more good than bad because<br>all social media does is reflect back to<br>us what we put into it so we all need to<br>look at look at our own behavior and you<br>know the comments that we make online<br>and everything and ask if we can do<br>better and secondly start taking<br>seriously these issues that are being<br>accentuated by social media so if social<br>media is telling us that there's a rise<br>of populism don't blame it on the<br>algorithm look at what social problems<br>this is pulling out and reflecting back<br>at us<br>thanks Ben Jason yeah that's so true Ben<br>and I think um you know if people are<br>losing trust in institutions then they<br>might have a point so that's the first<br>place to start isn't it<br>um and you know I look at<br>um I was at another conference this year<br>about or last year about uh social media<br>and what to do about it and the general<br>consensus and this was from a lot of<br>countries was that banning hate speech<br>or trying to ban content on social media<br>is not the right way to go about it you<br>know first of all just deal with the<br>basics authenticate users you know if<br>you look at Banks Banks can't just take<br>sackfuls of money from Anonymous people<br>they have to confirm that you're a real<br>person so you know there's a great<br>phrase of freedom of speech but not for<br>bots so you can ban the bots off social<br>media by authenticating real people and<br>then you can tweet anonymously but you<br>have to be a real person initially right<br>um the second one is is confirming age<br>so you can do that by authenticating<br>real people um and then content<br>moderation can happen I know Pinterest<br>and YouTube do it really effectively<br>that when something goes viral I think<br>it Ben will correct me but it's<br>something like more than 300 shares or<br>something like that<br>um then that's they go oh something's<br>happening here so we need a human to<br>come in and look at this content are we<br>live streaming murder here then we're<br>going to stop it right it's illegal so<br>you don't actually need hate speech<br>legislation to do that and the final<br>thing I would say on that is that again<br>you know populist movements can be a<br>force for good in New Zealand the New<br>Zealand population was way ahead of the<br>government on supporting Ukraine they<br>could see very clearly what the issues<br>were here and it took the government you<br>know a bunch of focus groups and so on<br>to work out that oh and perhaps we<br>should be doing something a bit more<br>kind of muscular here and even in the EU<br>this week I saw a poll out which said<br>that the majority of people across the<br>European Union<br>don't see this as a war in Europe they<br>see it as a war on Europe<br>so even after a year you know people are<br>supporting<br>um you know a muscular response to<br>it's on you know this issue of trust and<br>ensuring that democracy is able to<br>thrive<br>I might answer a slightly different part<br>of the question<br>because one of the um one of the parts<br>of the digital environment that I think<br>is really interesting to me is that<br>um is the challenge for government and<br>regulators and policy makers<br>pooping much more normal and much faster<br>than they have been and I don't<br>necessarily say that to call for<br>regulation or to suggest that<br>regulations the way to approach some of<br>the issues that would say with with big<br>tech companies but<br>the development of social media<br>platforms or of the algorithms that<br>power so much of the big ticket<br>companies services<br>moves so much faster than our public<br>victories everywhere and Google and<br>Facebook have made<br>um many billions of dollars by uh<br>breaking rules and moving faster than<br>the people who would enforce those<br>um so there's a real challenge for<br>government policymakers Regulators on<br>how to speed up how to be able to get to<br>grits with fast moving technology so<br>that they're not always turning up to a<br>race that's already finished by the time<br>it gets yeah<br>um and I think that is becoming more<br>pronounced not less<br>um as we've seen over the last four<br>months or so there's a current boom and<br>generative uh artificial intelligence uh<br>that's happening at the moment with chat<br>GPT and the other services that can<br>respond to the user prompts and create<br>content seemingly out of linear actually<br>I think large training databases but uh<br>technology like that is uh it's it's<br>that race that the government's already<br>tuned up late to like now all the<br>runners who have long finished were on<br>steroids as well<br>thanks<br>we've got one question from the floor<br>uh Adrian here I just wanted to pick up<br>on that thing Patrick because and Jesse<br>and I were talking about this before<br>which is it's pretty clear in our<br>society the you know the business and<br>economic machine of our of Our Lives the<br>social and cultural Machines of our<br>lives have been digitized over the last<br>20 or 30 years and we got used to<br>responsiveness dynamism immediacy uh<br>from that but governing in politics in<br>its broader sense has not uh digitized<br>in the same way and so we've got this<br>big deficit with our beliefs and and<br>expectations of our entire world has not<br>been matched by the process of governing<br>or delivering services to our community<br>in a material way so if we are to build<br>trusted institutions to pick up your<br>point you just made it feels to me a<br>digital revolution has to travel through<br>all of government and the way that it<br>serves the community so I wondered if<br>you could maybe comment on that<br>which doesn't mean MP's doing really<br>boring tweets and and you know making us<br>lose the will to live yeah<br>um I mean I think you're absolutely<br>right and if you look at Tick Tock I<br>mean Ben you know I I don't whether you<br>agree but I mean Tick Tock is about the<br>only place where you really hear<br>authentic working-class voices in New<br>Zealand so you know it comes with all<br>these flaws absolutely but so there's<br>some way in which<br>um<br>you're right I think it's it there's<br>kind of a divide between you know people<br>live and live on social media government<br>and institutions live in another another<br>parallel universe and every now and then<br>they bore us rigid with their sound<br>bites on Twitter<br>um so yeah I I think it comes to that<br>Democratic deficit much more it's part<br>of it but it's also part of kind of<br>moving away from the so-called mingvas<br>politicians where they're so risk-averse<br>that um you know 50 shades of beige and<br>I wonder also if it's um goes back to<br>the to the era even though I'm a you<br>know<br>um supporter a member of Tony Blair's<br>Institute but Tony Blair Bill Clinton<br>the professionalism of the politician<br>um and you know somehow it kind of<br>rubbed sandpapered off some of the moral<br>Crusade of politics and the kind of<br>rough edges and I think there's a<br>craving for kind of authenticity which<br>um those politicians that can do that<br>whether on social media or or just you<br>know in forums like this or out in the<br>community that that they will succeed<br>thanks Josie and I'm sorry uh we have<br>run into time here we've got the<br>mandatory policy panel waiting in the<br>sidelines ready to come through so what<br>I'm going to do is is thank the policy<br>the panelists very much but also<br>acknowledge that some of the points for<br>example you raised Al uh we've got a<br>session on China coming up so hopefully<br>you'll be able to stick around for that<br>session as well because as we've seen<br>these these panels are often linking and<br>interweaving with great issues that are<br>going to emerge in subsequent patterns<br>as well maybe I'll I'll end with Josie's<br>point you know polite people don't<br>change the world I hope that we are<br>polite in this forum but very much the<br>aim is to promote rigorous discussion<br>even where we don't agree so hopefully<br>we can be reasonably polite about it but<br>naughty kind but naughty okay maybe<br>that'll be our catchphrase and Matt what<br>do you think well thank you very much<br>again to our four panelists including uh<br>Patrick for making those last minute<br>contingency plans been from zooming in<br>in Britain and our two
