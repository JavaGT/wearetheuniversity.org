Featuring Tania Tapsell (Mayor of Rotorua District Council), Brad Olsen (CEO & Principal Economist, Infometrics), Simon Bridges (CEO of Auckland Business Chamber), and Chris Meehan (CEO of Winton property development firm).</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I am reflecting back on a couple of the<br>other economics forums we've run and I<br>was particularly interested in that<br>session because when we're talking about<br>this we're often talking about issues of<br>policy and so the way that our public<br>sector is set up at a central and local<br>government level the interaction between<br>the political uh and the officials the<br>political elements and the officials and<br>advice is so fundamental to the way that<br>everything else we're talking about<br>works so now coming out from how the<br>system works to one part of it next<br>session on infrastructure Housing and<br>Development<br>um like many of our topics it's<br>essentially never been so topical and we<br>have an excellent panel so I welcome the<br>it's a tight it's tight when we've got<br>all right so we have uh with us Simon<br>Bridges a well-known face to everybody<br>in New Zealand now leading the Auckland<br>business chamber and who has recently<br>along with his uh<br>co-chairs of the chambers of waikato and<br>Bay of Plenty who are both in the room<br>met Cowley and Don good launched the an<br>infrastructure Forum further top of the<br>North Island we also have Chris Meehan<br>uh CEO and chair of Winton Property<br>Group one of New Zealand's largest<br>property development groups we have<br>Tanya tapsel the mayor of Rotorua lakes<br>and also with the background and<br>resource planning and we have Brad Olson<br>the CEO principal Economist of<br>infametrics so a fantastic panel with a<br>broad range of views I will hand over to<br>you I'm going to start on this side<br>Simon I'm going to set the time warning<br>three to five minutes otherwise I give a<br>conspicuous cough and we're in your<br>hands hi well thanks very much um Matt<br>you hear me and thank you for what you<br>do on your leadership here at waikato<br>and of course they're putting on things<br>like this which is hugely important I<br>mean I think um the first thing to say<br>is when we think infrastructure on<br>um enthusiastic immature when it comes<br>to transport really more than some of<br>the other areas and things have<br>absolutely changed uh I think as a<br>result of what's happened in the last<br>month or so once in Cyclone and we hear<br>the situation at the moment that you<br>know as well as I do we are key<br>communities the more uh Gisborne Tire<br>Rafferty uh the Hawkes Bay coromandel<br>are cut off in the key routes in and out<br>that both to be communities but also<br>their Freight and supply chain are cut<br>off I mean I've been thinking about this<br>it seems to me what's really important<br>it's about to short-term and the<br>long-term around this and what can<br>happen is that different groups can make<br>the mistake of focusing only on one<br>politicians obviously sometimes focus on<br>short term but I think what's also true<br>is think tanks in groups that are in<br>this space often focus on the long-term<br>expensive children the short term is<br>really important and I know you've got<br>Adrian all here I met uh tomorrow and he<br>said well you know um because of the<br>inflation it really either we have<br>detects more or spend uh less<br>um the logic of that is there our city<br>don't want to see more taxes I think uh<br>we we've got an economic environment<br>where that would be<br>um that would that would be fraud when<br>it comes to spending this look obviously<br>it's about priorities but what I would<br>say here is it's not as a an investing<br>in our infrastructure and our roading it<br>works we're wasting money we are<br>investing in our future and into<br>generational Investments so it seems to<br>me at a level it has to happen I also<br>think in reality we're talking about an<br>environment that's got low uh public<br>debt at New Zealand relative to other<br>countries and so in the end as I say<br>we've sort of got to get on and do it I<br>was interested in what Ann was saying at<br>the last one I think what's really<br>important here in rebuilding these<br>networks is<br>um I was involved in quite cool<br>earthquakes and the the rebuild there<br>and what happened there was Parliament<br>came together that almost unanimously<br>gotten tidy unanimously but um it passed<br>for more to do it with pace and that was<br>an important prioritization is also<br>really important and I think government<br>should be really quickly identifying<br>which routes need to be done first and<br>getting on with those and having those<br>second tier ones there<br>um you know for later in the sense I<br>think I think the other thing that's<br>really interesting in all of this is the<br>level of service that new zealanders<br>expect and the reality is<br>um you know if your central Auckland<br>that the level of service you get in<br>transport<br>requirements older lead trips our gifts<br>and some of the the back blocks<br>um but I think we have to be really<br>careful that when we're talking about<br>um managed Retreat we accept that<br>actually communities oftentimes even if<br>it is at a gravel road level do require<br>a level of service and and be cautious<br>about sort of saying well no we're not<br>going to do that anymore because of this<br>that and the other thing clearly when we<br>build back better things will change and<br>there'll be different routes in the like<br>but actually that shouldn't be excuse<br>for actually a bit of ambition around<br>what we need to do in New Zealand over<br>the next year or so there's probably<br>enough of a soapbox for me I think I was<br>feeling a tickle but I'm all good so<br>interesting discussion and flows on<br>really nicely from the previous panel I<br>really come to this panel with the<br>whether that says the new mayor of which<br>I spent nine years as the local<br>counselor as well or my time on the New<br>Zealand community board so you've heard<br>already there's 78 councils across New<br>Zealand 110 Community boards across the<br>country and when you take that in a<br>perspective we are the people that are<br>also looking after our provincial in our<br>rural areas of which New Zealand is<br>predominantly made up of so I know in<br>these discussions we tend to focus on<br>the big cities on Auckland on Wellington<br>in a way on Hamilton as well but we<br>can't forget that New Zealand Ultra at<br>all we think about it there are many<br>many communities out there so how do we<br>make sure that we keep that local voice<br>and infrastructure that is our job as<br>councils infrastructure is one of the<br>biggest expenditure items but you're<br>here today as well that centralization<br>sorry I'll just keep talking and<br>hopefully you can hear me that we are a<br>the expenditure that we spend in New<br>Zealand<br>uh washer the three Waters currently<br>to say<br>within our local community as well if<br>the decision making can be local now to<br>put that 90 into the perspective if we<br>look at what other countries do Courier<br>40 USA 50<br>Australia 60 so why is New Zealand so so<br>centralized at 90 percent of public<br>expenditure being made by decision<br>makers in government and Parliament so<br>is the future for us on unlocking<br>infrastructure providing quality<br>infrastructure but also remembering that<br>that unlocks the Housing and Development<br>that we need will we be better served by<br>further centralizing and I'm going to<br>say it the three Waters and other key<br>decision-making abilities when it's our<br>local communities in New Zealand that<br>need to make sure that they not only<br>keep their local voice but are able to<br>continue to be thriving in a way that<br>best suits them as well<br>I know we've seen across the country<br>some criticisms of council I know we've<br>had things like Commissioners come into<br>place but remember it is your role and<br>your opportunity every three years to<br>vote so the big question that I always<br>put out is why is voter turnout so low<br>as well why is there only four out of<br>ten people voting for councils so when<br>we put that into perspective those are<br>the facts and figures that's what we're<br>dealing with infrastructure is a really<br>crucial part but I wanted to touch<br>briefly because we do have a solution as<br>well and I want to give an example of<br>how we help to unlock housing now in<br>Joshua we did partner between our local<br>Council the government and also local<br>ewe to create a housing Accord so we<br>have infrastructure in place we know<br>where we need it but we need to unlock<br>housing and we also need to stop which<br>unfortunately you probably have heard of<br>the emergency housing motels in<br>Rochester and actually across the<br>country as well that was only a symptom<br>of a failed investment and<br>infrastructure to unlock the housing and<br>unlock affordable housing across the<br>country so the solution that we came up<br>with and believe it or not we are<br>working together in good faith and we're<br>getting good progress with the<br>government as well so we signed a<br>housing Accord shortly after being<br>elected what that does is we've got a<br>few shared outcomes but we actually<br>share resources as well so I know<br>there's a lot of Doom and Gloom these<br>all the things that are wrong but we<br>have already seen such great progress<br>through that housing Accord that those<br>emergency housing motels have not only<br>halved but we have gone from about 350<br>families to now 152 families in there<br>because they are also progressing into<br>the houses that are now there because we<br>fast-tracked that development and that<br>growth as well so that's probably my<br>comments for now but happy to contribute<br>later as well I was itching to go but<br>thank you Tanya and it's great to have<br>for the session some of the the<br>positives as well okay Chris thanks Matt<br>so<br>I guess I come from this to this<br>discussion from the perspective of a<br>bloke that goes to work every day with a<br>super talented team of people and a fair<br>bit of resource<br>and all we want to do is build more and<br>more and more houses and and you would<br>think when you you Google the words<br>housing crisis in New Zealand and you<br>get about a hundred thousand articles<br>come up in your face<br>you would think that's fairly<br>straightforward proposition<br>but unfortunately the the reality for us<br>is we we spend most of our time and most<br>of our resource battling bureaucracy to<br>get it done<br>now you take a wider View and you say<br>okay here's this great country of New<br>Zealand that we all love so much<br>and you look at the Urban Land content<br>of New Zealand the Urban Land<br>constitutes less than one percent of our<br>land mass so you say to yourself well<br>why is there a housing crisis we're not<br>short of land we're not short of reasons<br>we're not sure of smart people to build<br>them<br>why are we short of houses<br>so you know when we break it down in<br>cost terms it's purely a problem of our<br>own making the regulatory environment<br>that we operate in mostly under the RMA<br>is such that we've put this<br>artificial constraint on the supply of<br>houses in New Zealand and that make no<br>mistake that is what has caused the<br>housing crisis<br>so we've Bentley our way through this<br>regulation every day of Our Lives we and<br>if some of you might find this<br>remarkable but we genuinely do spend<br>more money on bureaucracy and legal<br>cases and and just general regulatory<br>navigation than we do on physically<br>building a section and that is<br>ridiculous it's not good for anyone<br>so you then look at the sort of the<br>social costs of of this shortage of<br>houses and the regulatory cost that the<br>consumer the house owner ends up paying<br>and the social costs are enormous you're<br>seeing you know kids that are<br>transferred from school to school and<br>your truancy rates are higher because<br>they never get settled and you're seeing<br>people living in garages and cars and<br>all the health problems and the social<br>problem and the crime that comes out the<br>back of it and it's a huge social cost<br>and one that I think that New Zealand's<br>going to Bear the bundle for many many<br>years<br>so why do we do this to ourselves I mean<br>if you've made an analogy<br>and and bear with me on this a little<br>bit but if you write an analogy with the<br>the housing market and the the RMA<br>regulatory reform and and the health of<br>new zealanders you wouldn't find the<br>government<br>putting some sort of additive in the<br>water to make us all sick and then spend<br>billions of dollars making us better<br>again in housing the government<br>regulates that we can't have any houses<br>then spends billions of dollars<br>dealing with the problem and that's just<br>not all<br>so I guess where I see it is we've just<br>got into this regulatory Maya that's<br>very tough to get out of<br>and we're not moving forward I mean I'm<br>sorry to say the new RMA is diabolical<br>and there are many many<br>very practiced practitioners very<br>experienced practitioners who were just<br>leaving the industry because they they<br>can't be as sort of dealing with it for<br>another 10 years<br>and then you've got the UDA which is no<br>secret that we're battling with the<br>government to<br>get access to that but you know you've<br>got all this regulatory<br>stuff coming down the pipeline that<br>honestly from a practitioner's point of<br>view from someone that just as I said<br>wants to get out of bed and go and build<br>some houses it's just getting worse and<br>worse and worse so when you Google the<br>words housing crisis 10 years from now<br>instead of a hundred thousand hits<br>you're going to see a million hits and<br>that's a really sad thing to New Zealand<br>and I think the solution<br>which we should address<br>is really you need a big stick from<br>government somewhere you've got to break<br>the cycle and you've got to have<br>somewhere from government say okay you<br>know what rather than spend half the<br>money of a section it's cost on<br>paperwork and the other half I'm<br>building it let's take that half and let<br>the developer go and do their own<br>infrastructure because we can do it<br>cheaper than most that we can open up<br>huge big slides of land but just give us<br>the go ahead to do it stop stop saying<br>no let's let's become a country that<br>wants to address this housing crisis by<br>starting to say yes a bit more often<br>Chris thank you and to Brad<br>well I feel<br>I feel see if I can get the mic to work<br>will be the first one<br>um was that working yet no I don't think<br>it is I'll grab that one<br>um I I think I mean you've invited an<br>economist to the economics forum and uh<br>you know as the Dismal science I think<br>it's always dangerous<br>um but I'll sort of go with where Tanya<br>went as well in terms of more of a<br>bouquet than a brick bet and that's to<br>note that despite all the challenges and<br>gosh I'm looking forward to talking<br>about them there are some good things<br>that have been going on at the end of<br>last year or into September rather the<br>amount of other construction uh going on<br>in the country so Network infrastructure<br>was at its highest proportion of the<br>economy since 2010 at 3.62 if you strip<br>out mining it's the highest since the<br>70s so we are starting to move in a<br>better place there's still hundreds of<br>billions of dollars worth of<br>infrastructure still to be deployed but<br>I think it's worthwhile highlighting<br>that we're starting to at least move in<br>a better Direction<br>the two things that get me and and again<br>um this is an economics Forum as well as<br>all the other conversations we've been<br>having the first one is around<br>incentives and I really don't think that<br>we've got them very well aligned and<br>importantly I don't think that they<br>function uh or or uh at any point being<br>discussed when we talk about the big<br>issues if we think of water for example<br>which as a wellingtonian um I'm quite<br>Keen to get some pipes that will bring<br>me water uh at the right time not in a<br>puddle out in the street and we'll take<br>the water that I don't want away from my<br>house without it ending up also on the<br>street<br>um is that when we think about the<br>incentives if if I'm a council if I'm uh<br>you know an over and Tauranga and<br>Fontana down and Rotorua uh if I want to<br>build a road I get 50 on that from nzta<br>if I want to build a pipe I'm paying for<br>that fully myself and so it's pretty<br>clear that over time and more<br>importantly you can see the road and<br>people talk about it and like it the<br>pipes underground are no one season<br>Until It Breaks so I feel like the<br>incentives are a bit warped financially<br>and we've got to think about addressing<br>that you know where is the a<br>conversation about the national land<br>transport fund but for water where's the<br>conversation around some of the water<br>metering and charges that we might be<br>doing better because we don't fund it<br>properly the same when it comes to<br>housing I mean we just you heard from<br>Chris how difficult it is when he has to<br>deal with all of the uh you know the<br>Council planning rules and similar if I<br>go into a council building and say I<br>want to build a house I reckon you<br>should get a bottle of champagne these<br>days you you're doing a good job but<br>correct me if I'm wrong but if you do<br>that at the moment they're going gosh<br>that's more work that I now have to fund<br>from somewhere and so I think the<br>difficulty again is that where's the<br>incentive if I'm a council I've got to<br>do more work and I get less money for it<br>got to figure out of my ltp where I put<br>the next amount of infrastructure how<br>many DC's I charge and every other<br>acronym Under the Sun but I don't get<br>paid anything so where is that thought<br>around actually where that Revenue comes<br>from so that it can support the right<br>incentives it's not just about the money<br>itself it's about putting the right<br>conditions economically for people to go<br>yeah I like that that does well for me<br>because I get paid to do it<br>the second bit and and a wider Point uh<br>that is going to come into sharp relief<br>with uh what's happened with the Cyclone<br>recently is prioritization we do not<br>have the materials we do not have the<br>people to do everything we want to do<br>right here and now and we're seeing that<br>all the time and and for everyone who<br>says oh yeah but we managed to get away<br>with it well given how crumbling some of<br>our infrastructure seems to be it I I'd<br>submit that probably not uh might be the<br>case I'm a northlander at the moment the<br>brand new ones are stuffed uh that is<br>the major transport Network into the<br>entire Northern Region the fastest<br>growing population Zone in the country<br>and we've said you know what guys sorry<br>your holiday Highway means that you can<br>get cut off that's disgusting and I<br>would suggest that we need to have a<br>much better conversation around what are<br>the priorities now that's a difficult<br>discussion but when it comes to<br>infrastructure I am worried that we seem<br>to think that we can do everything all<br>the time no matter what it is and the<br>simple fact of the matter is we can't if<br>we're going to get serious about the uh<br>sort of infrastructure that we want to<br>build in this country we are going to<br>have to to make tough decisions about<br>not only what gets funded but also what<br>doesn't and what we are willing and able<br>to put on the back burner because there<br>has to be stuff that comes first if you<br>don't the market works very well at<br>telling you that the stuff you already<br>started happens and the stuff that you<br>didn't start but really desperately<br>wanted to well it goes and goes and goes<br>further and further down the line so I<br>think we do have to have a really<br>serious conversation about that<br>prioritization what that looks like<br>across the country but also how we<br>integrate that because increasingly<br>we're not doing uh the sort of Linked UP<br>infrastructure that we need to every<br>single acronym Under the Sun in<br>Wellington has a different idea of where<br>the next bit of infrastructure needs to<br>go which means that you've got people in<br>the construction sector running around<br>like mad cats trying to get to the next<br>site because we're never joined up so I<br>think we've got a lot of work to do<br>around prioritization we've got to sit<br>the right incentives and the right<br>funding to get into a better position<br>but I am at least grateful that we are<br>building more infrastructure now than we<br>have done before<br>brilliant no coffee either<br>and we will come back to prioritization<br>a little bit later look there's a lot of<br>that a lot in there and there are some<br>good questions coming through I'm<br>actually going to start one with You<br>Chris and you don't all need to comment<br>on every issue there'll be different<br>things that um that spark your interests<br>more<br>so there's huge amounts of bureaucracies<br>you've said there's the cost of that<br>it's costing more to get through that<br>side than to actually put up the house<br>if we were at a different Forum one of<br>the discussions would probably be about<br>might be about RMA or its Replacements<br>saying but it hasn't worked for the<br>other reasons maybe we need more because<br>obviously some of the environmental<br>outcomes haven't been what we've wanted<br>how do we get that mix right between<br>what the regulation is trying to achieve<br>make things simpler easier but also get<br>to good outcomes<br>without it costing more than it'll<br>actually cost to do the work and I'm<br>really interested in your view on that<br>and this is something of course others<br>might have a view and Simon of course<br>you've been on the other side of um some<br>of those ministerial roles around uh<br>Ministry of Transport and so on as well<br>but I think you know as I said the<br>default position from most councils and<br>in our running fee from government<br>generally to more housing Supply their<br>default position is no and often the no<br>is because they don't want to pay for<br>the infrastructure and then I go and<br>spend more money fighting against that<br>no than it would have otherwise spent in<br>doing the infrastructure myself which is<br>ridiculous<br>um<br>so I think how do you fix it I think I<br>think the first thing is<br>you need to break the cycle so I think<br>if if we're and Brad might argue to<br>pitch and toss but any any Economist<br>seems to put the number currently at<br>somewhere between 50 and 100 000 houses<br>that we're short today you might argue<br>anyway I think it's in that region<br>there's a lot there's a lot yeah<br>um but I think if you're going to just<br>break the cycle quickly and then deal<br>with the regulatory reform which will no<br>doubt take some time I think you need a<br>big stick from the government that says<br>okay<br>Mr developer whoever it might be we'll<br>give you this patch of land you get off<br>and do the infrastructure yourself we<br>won't bug you down in regulation you<br>build five or ten thousand houses over<br>there and we'll leave you to it I think<br>that would break the the cycle while you<br>didn't figure out how to get the RMA<br>back into check I think one of the the<br>the balancing things they are in my set<br>out to do was to balance the the urban<br>outcome with the environmental outcome<br>but as I said we occupy one percent of<br>the landmass if we occupied one point<br>one percent of the land mass this<br>problem goes away so I think we surely<br>can figure a way to do that and not<br>offend the environmental outcomes that<br>the RMA seeks to positive<br>great did anybody else want to jump in<br>on that or otherwise I can I've got a<br>lot here<br>I mean just just to the to the point<br>around funding how do I hold this so it<br>works<br>um is is I think that exact point around<br>you've also like I say you've got to<br>give the different options right I mean<br>we talked any good panel has a briefing<br>uh beforehand we talked about the likes<br>of ppps as well and sort of getting uh<br>the ability for the private sector to<br>get more involved I think there is a big<br>part in that<br>um but but a lot of the time I think we<br>talk a lot about you know where does the<br>money come from and actually there's<br>huge amounts of money out there if only<br>we're willing to do it there is I think<br>a nervousness sometimes to get the<br>infrastructure done<br>um I would perfectly submit that both<br>sides of the coin public and private<br>sector have done bad things before and<br>things have gone wrong<br>um if that's the case for both then sort<br>of no one is blameless and I feel like<br>we've got to find a Better Way Forward<br>rather than saying well you can't do it<br>well you can't either so therefore it<br>doesn't get done that that is an awful<br>place for us to get to as a country<br>given how much we need to do<br>um<br>all right Brad earlier<br>in to pre-warn this as a question coming<br>to you Tanya but it's something that's<br>been sparked by your comment spread the<br>incentives you know somebody wants to<br>build a house wants to build a road all<br>of those things from where you sit<br>you've talked about some really good<br>things happening<br>what's either working with the<br>incentives that you've got in play now<br>or how could those incentives be<br>improved so that some of the things that<br>seem obvious can actually start<br>happening<br>I think to answer that question um and<br>something that's been on the back of my<br>mind now stepping into this role is mere<br>is we get so focused on making change<br>when actually we just need to make it<br>count so when we only have a limited uh<br>time and limited money available and by<br>us we're very limited because our only<br>income is rates how do we ensure that<br>any dollar that we are spending will get<br>the return on investment but also<br>tangible practical outcomes for our<br>community where they can have confidence<br>so I think it goes back to being really<br>clear right from the start what are we<br>trying to achieve and then actually<br>sitting that direction clearly because I<br>think where we get a lot of the round<br>and circles and a lot of the delays is<br>we as politicians sit this is our<br>10-year plan this is our annual plan<br>this is what we want to do but we don't<br>give clear Direction on how when and why<br>and the how actually becomes really<br>important when it comes to delivering<br>which is why I'm so passionate about<br>localism because we can say yes we want<br>to save money here yes we want to build<br>more but how do we make that practical<br>in terms of do we actually have the<br>skills and resources in this District to<br>be able to do it when we bring the<br>skilled people in where they're going to<br>live where they're going to stay and<br>then how do we make and I think actually<br>antoli touched on this really well as<br>well in terms of when you see writing<br>projects and are we doing efficiently<br>enough so I think to answer that<br>question it's not necessarily about<br>um the change that's needed it is just<br>making that limited resource that we<br>have count and holding ourselves as<br>politicians and decision makers to<br>account more than just continuously<br>blaming it on the people who are only<br>there and this is a lot of our staff<br>they're delivering on what we ask them<br>to do in the first place<br>great thank you<br>um Simon I'm going to come to you there<br>was a very very direct question and I<br>don't know if this is placing you in a<br>position but I know you're well skilled<br>at that but I'll answer the question I<br>want so don't worry<br>that's right can you hear me<br>so<br>Light Rail Auckland getting a lot of<br>media now I think there's a big<br>discussion here that we're going to<br>spend a bit more time on around<br>prioritization<br>what do you think should happen what is<br>happening yeah I mean look now I'm out<br>of Polish I try me a little bit careful<br>about um particular projects that the<br>truth of the light rail one is you know<br>um I've always been deeply skeptical<br>um I know some of the people on the uh<br>the board and like rail.codones yeah<br>I've got a great deal of time for them I<br>think you know if any of them can kind<br>of anyone can deliver it that they they<br>could<br>um and they present quite a compelling<br>case around what it means in terms of<br>City shaping and urban transformation<br>these wonderful things I think you still<br>have to come back to the fact though<br>when you're thinking about light rail it<br>is such a big projects it it quite<br>literally is the funding for everything<br>else in war and so it comes to that<br>question of prioritization<br>um I think if they would have put<br>forward the case for one discrete<br>portion of it with the benefit and cost<br>of that laid out that there is a case to<br>be made for that and it could be a<br>debate on that but I think the overall<br>thing is so big uh that that's uh that<br>that's a real issue and it will be<br>susceptible and I put no blame kind of<br>on anyone I will be specific<br>schools with that given that this is a<br>you know 20 30 thing a 30-year thing<br>if if not longer thank you anybody else<br>and that is around funny I also tried to<br>make it cool throated kind of case in my<br>open remarks that actually funding isn't<br>the real issue that's not something<br>about it Money Matters borrowing matters<br>all of these things<br>um that's not suggest either that the<br>public model isn't broken our national<br>land transport fund at the moment has<br>been asked to fund rail ever grow public<br>transport subsidy and the Roads<br>Maintenance and and Improvement now all<br>of those things are good things but but<br>it's doing more than it ever kind of<br>could the biggest issue though on<br>infrastructure today and I think Brad<br>touched on this I I hope you'd agree but<br>it's capacity and capability namely that<br>the firms and the workers to do it and I<br>let's go there right now and we've got<br>people in the in the room on this let's<br>say we can money's unlimited you know 18<br>months ago that felt like it was true<br>um<br>we do have relatively low public debt we<br>can go out and Source funds if we want<br>we've already had discussions on<br>immigration a bit earlier in the day and<br>lots of different views but let's say we<br>had the money we went big<br>can we actually deliver with the skills<br>that we've got here now because this<br>isn't just people digging holes or not<br>just there's that there's a hell of a<br>lot of geotechnical work there's a hell<br>of a lot of project management do we<br>actually have the skills in the country<br>to deliver what we want I'm going to<br>start with You Chris 100 I mean if you<br>look at all of the the big civil<br>projects in the Middle East and and you<br>know some in Europe I mean the the Kiwi<br>engineer the Kiwi planner the Kiwi uh<br>construction manager is the most widely<br>sought after on the planet we 100<br>definitely have the skills<br>um and I think<br>that's not going to go away anytime soon<br>yeah I mean I just totally disagree<br>um<br>I mean um right now uh<br>on on a variety of kind of boards and<br>things online you've got a waste<br>management sector there's your rubbish<br>they need several thousand workers so<br>their workers are working overtime it's<br>just not remotely sustainable<br>same is true in the National Road<br>carriers for a Monon and the many<br>hundreds of truck drivers they need not<br>tomorrow not the second time right now<br>but they don't have so the the system is<br>just not sustainable you add to that the<br>fact that we've got a rebuild to do<br>that's going to require hundreds if not<br>thousands of workers and it's a really<br>big issue um<br>what the government said is good and I<br>give them that you know I give them a<br>tick they've announced a recovery Visa<br>but the issue with the recovery Visa is<br>it is explicitly short term I don't know<br>if you saw where Australia was at um<br>just last week but yeah um labor party<br>uh home office I think they call it uh<br>Minister Claire Claire O'Neill I think<br>your name is she sick quite clearly<br>they're going more pro-business there is<br>no short term every immigrant that comes<br>to New Zealand will shortly have a<br>pathway to Residence and the problem<br>with immigration is good isn't good<br>enough it has to be better in our case<br>if Australia has a better Pathway to<br>residency that's where the Filipino<br>truck driver or the Indian contractor<br>will go so look I I ate a liver might<br>take Chris's point that there are skills<br>that could come back but a rural<br>physical terms we're going to need a<br>whole lot more migrants and that's got<br>to downplay the issues around housing<br>that they'll have and so on and they're<br>just not here at the moment and sorry<br>I'll differentiate the two things we<br>have the skill set<br>and the brain power we don't have the<br>Manpower which I think are two distinct<br>things<br>good thank you I think as well I mean<br>you look at all of the large<br>infrastructure projects that we're<br>currently doing and ask if we can even<br>do I know that I see that infrastructure<br>levels are as high as I've been which is<br>true but I'm worried that they won't go<br>a whole lot further how's Dunedin<br>Hospital going at the moment how's the<br>manawatu gorge replacement going that's<br>what nearly 10 years uh so far<br>um I'm not convinced that we have the<br>ability to deliver the large projects<br>that we've currently got on the cards at<br>the moment I was at whangarei hospital<br>last year as my grandfather passed away<br>and the windows were falling out of the<br>goddamn place like no I I don't think<br>that we've got the planning the people<br>all the resources to necessarily do this<br>sort of stuff at the moment more<br>importantly the panel uh earlier when it<br>will feel the panels earlier we heard<br>about education we heard about the likes<br>of um immigration I know that in some<br>parts of the country there are three<br>times as many people leaving the<br>workforce in the next 10 years as there<br>are coming in that's going to make it<br>even more difficult we don't have enough<br>water technicians at the moment you've<br>got government departments that are<br>paying over the tops to find building<br>control offices and stealing them from<br>councils I'm I feel like we're playing a<br>little bit of musical chairs at the<br>moment um so I'm not convinced that we<br>have the the skills the people the<br>resources Simon's point is right around<br>the money in a sense that yes we could<br>go out tomorrow and the government could<br>borrow hundreds of billions of dollars<br>what are we gonna do with it who's going<br>to spend it we're going to spend it on<br>even more expensive stuff and probably<br>deliver less for it so I'm not convinced<br>I know that's pessimistic and I but I<br>feel like in the sense it's also<br>realistic it says that we do need to get<br>back to basics but we've got to have a<br>pretty clear plan what are we trying to<br>do with the resources that we've got uh<br>we know the order is broken we know that<br>our health care System needs more<br>investment we know that parts of<br>Education need the same thing there is<br>no plan in this country that says what<br>we're going to do next on infrastructure<br>councils have got half of the solution<br>they've got where some of the network<br>infrastructure is and after that we<br>leave it to every individual department<br>and government to come up with what<br>they're doing next there is no<br>integrated Asset Management plan<br>everyone was surprised the other year<br>when there was poo running down the<br>walls at middlemore and there was you<br>know mold in a classroom in Upper Hutt<br>or in the Hut I think it was why were we<br>surprised no one had ever thought about<br>you know ensuring that those assets were<br>renewed we just hope that they go over<br>and then when they fall over we go oh<br>damn it'll be 10 years before we get to<br>that again if we're so bad at actually<br>planning the uh the past and the present<br>I'm a little bit worried about the<br>future<br>and it's too right but I think this is<br>where that making it counts really<br>important because yes we do have the<br>skill set and yes we don't have enough<br>people so what do we do the solution is<br>actually making those tough decisions<br>now there are a lot of councils going<br>through our annual plan process right at<br>the moment what politicians have never<br>been good at is actually delivering on<br>their Promises of stopping the spend so<br>now we have to get really real really<br>serious because our people are not<br>getting paid any more money to be paying<br>any more rates for all of that<br>additional infrastructure that we need<br>and we have a really critical<br>crisis where a lot of our engineers and<br>councils if not already our retirement<br>age are approaching retirement age and<br>we do not have a succession plan of them<br>coming through now that's pretty serious<br>when you think about Waters and<br>infrastructure as well so again what can<br>we do with what we have make the most of<br>it make those hard decisions prioritize<br>that the people that we do have on the<br>ground can actually deliver<br>I mean two really brief comments and<br>then I'm going to be well behaved but I<br>just you know I'm not suggesting that<br>there is a bottomless don't no one's<br>suggesting that but what worries me is I<br>don't want to see<br>um the funding issue become an excuse<br>when you take State Highway 1 and to<br>Northland for example for doing a proper<br>job the reality of that road is pretty<br>simple the first part that's four lanes<br>stood up perfectly no issues whatsoever<br>fundamentally but the risk that having<br>had the resiliency factors built in is a<br>shambles and we still can't use it<br>properly so we do need to plan do those<br>and there's plenty of funding ways<br>whether ppps or loans<br>intergenerationally to make that happen<br>that we could sort of do that so I think<br>that's<br>um that that's a pretty important point<br>Thank You Simon uh one question from<br>Adrian sort of a a question and a<br>statement having a bit of knowledge on<br>large-scale infrastructure development I<br>wanted to endorse the comments about the<br>lack of capacity in the country it is<br>really real and the reason for that is<br>that almost every developed economy<br>around the world is going through a 50<br>and 100 Year replacement of Civic and<br>National Assets of the same nature that<br>we're trying to deal with so the skills<br>for those kind of projects are in sharp<br>demand everywhere so uh that's number<br>one number two is that the large-scale<br>companies DaVinci's the the all those<br>big companies you know of the Spanish<br>the French<br>Etc even the Aussies<br>um we'll always still rely on the local<br>capacity to deliver those bits of<br>infrastructure so they'll fly in the big<br>big guys uh he'll come and and tell you<br>that they can do it then they'll turn<br>around and call on a local capacity to<br>build it now I don't think we've got<br>enough capacity to look after what we've<br>got let alone do the big jobs that need<br>to be done so I think we've got to be<br>real about that it comes back to the<br>immigration story again<br>and so I think one of the most important<br>things we can do and this is something<br>that Simon and I sort of worked on a<br>while ago years ago was we need to get<br>in behind the infrastructure commission<br>30-year Pipeline and we need to look<br>across both New Zealand and Australia<br>and try to build scale across those<br>things and I'll give you some examples<br>airports is one but tunnel boring is a<br>great example so watercare has a tunnel<br>Boring Machine drilling the tunnel<br>through Auckland we need to have the<br>next tunnels lined up right behind it so<br>that team of Specialists can stay in the<br>country can continue on to the next<br>tunnel and the one after that one after<br>that we need to have that 30-year plan<br>with triggers against each of those<br>projects in a bipartisan way that says<br>we know what needs to happen and we know<br>what the triggers will be for each of<br>those projects and give that signal to<br>the market so the market can start to<br>scale up get the skills in the country<br>and start to plan and predict when those<br>those projects will get underway and to<br>me that is one of the most critical<br>things that collectively all of us can<br>should get in behind for the next 50<br>years of infrastructure development and<br>then immigration everything else needs<br>to follow behind that as well there are<br>answers and we know what the answers are<br>we're just going to do it<br>can can I just um I mean you're<br>absolutely right but just one thing to<br>to respond with it I think<br>um we can come up with all the pipelines<br>in the world and the 30-year plans and<br>so on but if they're not integrated I am<br>worried that they don't go any further I<br>mean put it this way I I've I've<br>literally gone through uh over the last<br>decade every long-term plan from all<br>what was it 78 Council councils across<br>the country and pulled out their<br>infrastructure spend I've done the same<br>for all of the um other major providers<br>if it's a big Excel list of all of these<br>these are all the things we want to do<br>that's one thing but I do wonder if<br>actually we need to give infracom more<br>powers to be more directional instead of<br>saying hey you know look if you're a<br>government Department send me a plan<br>about what you want to do and I'll track<br>it on a spreadsheet which that's not to<br>denigrate what inficom does but I think<br>they actually needed a bit of an ability<br>to say actually look no we've got the<br>taranaki uh Hospital rebuild coming up<br>we need to put these other services<br>alongside it there's going to be a new<br>housing development in this area it<br>needs some sort of social provision<br>coming in as well we need to make sure<br>there's good electricity connections and<br>similar to the region I don't think<br>we've got that level of integration at<br>the moment I think that's even if we<br>solve all the other issues you<br>effectively have what you have in a<br>number of parts of the country where you<br>go from a four-lane highway to a<br>two-lane road and all of a sudden<br>everyone wonders why there's roadblocks<br>and similar we we don't seem to sequence<br>stuff properly it's the same as the<br>tunnel boring example I'm sure there are<br>some tunnel boring machines that New<br>Zealand has bought and then sold and<br>then re-bought again because we needed<br>it five years later so so that has to<br>come with not only the money the<br>resources of people but actually a a bit<br>more of a directional function not the<br>old town planning if you will of<br>yesteryear but an ability to say no not<br>your individual view counts but actually<br>here's a collective view of how we're<br>going to integrate infrastructure and<br>get everything going at once because at<br>the moment it seems to be hugely<br>haphazard<br>if one of them was a party that wasn't<br>in favor of the thing I think<br>considering what I thought at the time<br>though was that it would be a more<br>authoritative body that would be giving<br>us a sense that pipeline plan not not<br>exactly<br>um as we all knew it'd be room for a bit<br>I think unfortunately it just hasn't<br>quite moved out that way and that's not<br>to denigrate the infrastructure<br>commission I think the chief and seeking<br>importer you know excellent people and<br>they are doing some good good ports and<br>good work it's just there's not quite<br>doing<br>um what we thought uh is going to<br>I'm going to shift to housing now there<br>are two or three questions that have<br>come through<br>um<br>in the sort of the nature of housing<br>that is being built so there are<br>questions about whether we have a<br>genuine housing shortage or whether we<br>have a shortage of affordable homes<br>um do we expect much for what we can<br>afford to pay are we building two bigger<br>homes in some places are we gold plating<br>everything Chris I'm going to start<br>again with you but others please jump in<br>okay well the most cost effective<br>housing you can build<br>and I think this goes for the<br>infrastructure that goes with it is is<br>Greenfield small lot single story single<br>dwelling homes<br>and I think you have a lot of<br>politicians who look at the<br>the planning Roger even say oh no no<br>let's not do that let's densify or<br>intensify the areas that are already<br>urbanized and the problem there is the<br>infrastructure current code the pipes<br>don't cope with what's there now and<br>we've seen that pretty wholeheartedly in<br>the last two or three weeks and to<br>upgrade the infrastructure in those<br>areas means digging up the old pubs and<br>putting new ones in which is at least<br>double the cost of building Greenfield<br>and then just the share cost of building<br>a building up and in a condensed<br>area is about almost double or more than<br>double the cost of building single story<br>Greenfield homes so if you really want<br>to make it affordable unfortunately<br>people don't always like this but the<br>fact of the matter is you have to build<br>green field and you have to build single<br>story then you have to build small<br>smallish Lots with smaller houses on<br>them I think you know we got very used<br>to big houses and big backyards in New<br>Zealand but the the whole thing just got<br>too unaffordable so if you're really<br>going to make it affordable to everybody<br>you know you'd be surprised what you can<br>accomplish in 100 120 square meter house<br>and if you put some good Central Parks<br>and Central Recreation infrastructure in<br>you'd be surprised how happy your family<br>can be on a lot between two or three<br>hundred square meters inside<br>Tanya and I think to give some more<br>practical examples of how this housing<br>Accord is working really well for us is<br>we now have the aspirations of ewe who<br>are significant landowners<br>um you couple that with the<br>infrastructure acceleration fund from<br>the government that helps to support the<br>council's infrastructure and all of a<br>sudden we're all working together so<br>instead of it just being a hope and a<br>dream of private investors or ewe to<br>build homes we're actually saying okay<br>what's the infrastructure that Council<br>has planned for needs to plan for can<br>and can't afford and in government<br>please come to the table because we are<br>ready and waiting we just don't quite<br>have enough money and we've already seen<br>the progress on that and another example<br>is some of the land that Council may<br>have that is severely underutilized and<br>actually costs a lot to maintain how do<br>we use that better as well so if it's<br>not appropriate for a playground or a<br>reserve then is it appropriate to look<br>at for helping with housing as well so I<br>think um if you put together again<br>making it count all of the shared<br>operations and actually what we're about<br>to do in adult Studio as well as a<br>future development strategy which we<br>have 30-year infrastructure strategies<br>but then how do we couple that with<br>infrastructure with housing and then<br>with General Community growth we are the<br>new schools in hospitals or even<br>cemeteries going to go in the future and<br>I think that by working together because<br>we've heard it for years and years and<br>years and we hear it with government<br>agencies we all work in silos and we<br>don't talk with each other now the<br>housing according Tortura has been a<br>perfect example where we're breaking<br>through those barriers we're saying we<br>don't have an option anymore we need to<br>and we're actually starting to see a<br>ripple effect through Council agencies<br>but also government too I'm seeing a<br>guest lecture on the housing Accord for<br>Rotorua coming at the waikato management<br>I I think it's important not to write<br>off the the level of attached dwelling<br>Zone in the country because um if you<br>discount them then apparently half of<br>the new builds in this country aren't<br>happening you know that's just not true<br>so attached dwellings are very important<br>the literature is quite clear on on how<br>much the densification uh is is<br>contributing across the country so I I<br>think it's important to to have that on<br>on record I think I mean in terms of a<br>part of the question I think Matt was<br>you know what is the actual shortage<br>well you only have to go as far as to<br>seeing social housing waitlist to get a<br>clear example of the absolute bare<br>minimum if you will across the country<br>but one one one thing that does come<br>through in this that I think is is<br>worthwhile noting for the future because<br>part of this is about the future<br>considerations that we have is what do<br>we do in the future when we have by 20<br>uh 68 another million over 65 year olds<br>but only 600 000 odd 15 or 64 year olds<br>we know that people as they age require<br>housing in a different way I'm and I<br>don't have any particular answers of<br>this but I think one question we need to<br>grab with as a country probably globally<br>needs to be how does our housing evolve<br>over time to go from bigger houses to<br>smaller houses you know because<br>increasingly we're building uh we've got<br>a lot of houses across the country but<br>increasingly I don't know if we're<br>building the right stuff in the right<br>places that's probably more the question<br>that comes forward you know in in the<br>future how do you transform a four<br>bedroom home into a one-bedroom is that<br>possible uh and and because increasingly<br>we are going to see that people are<br>living uh in different ways of living<br>longer they're going to require a<br>different level of service so there's a<br>question over not only what we're<br>building right now and do we have enough<br>but do we have the right sort of housing<br>stock for the future is an open question<br>that I'm not going to answer here but I<br>think it is something we've got to<br>Grapple with<br>thank you<br>so I just want to add a small point<br>which is really valuable because I think<br>we've been talking big scale but if you<br>actually look at little scale mum and<br>dad or first home buyer and what we can<br>help to what we can do to help assist<br>them as well and the medium density<br>changes that actually came in<br>um enabled us for people who have the<br>traditional kiwi big house on a really<br>big section that can actually use the<br>limited assets that they do have that<br>land to either subdivide and put on up<br>to three dwellings on that one section<br>now or actually what we're seeing many<br>of the consents coming through it or<br>shoulder council at the moment if people<br>are now putting a minor dwelling on for<br>their child or for their parents so that<br>they can actually afford to have an<br>affordable home as well so I think we<br>need to be smart about<br>um how our families practically do it<br>but how we can support those people with<br>limited investment and assets to<br>on housing why don't we invest in<br>modular housing in New Zealand the<br>Scandinavian countries who topped the<br>list of everything that happens in the<br>world just about 87 percent of their<br>houses are modular homes<br>we insist on building every house<br>separately and more expensively why is<br>it that the industry hasn't moved to<br>what is a cheaper option but a perfectly<br>equal option in terms of a home and<br>they're just absolutely surprises me on<br>that but the other point I just want to<br>support Brad on we just are not still it<br>goes back to my earlier point we're not<br>looking at the future of society and<br>what the housing needs are of tomorrow's<br>society and tomorrow's Society is not<br>that far away that we will need and I<br>think that right keep it up because that<br>needs to be done but go back to modular<br>you can't believe that you won't have<br>um the short answer is we don't have<br>enough scale here in New Zealand to<br>build it efficiently and and<br>they are but they can they can have<br>factories that can deliver all over<br>Europe if they're cost effectively we<br>don't have a market beyond our own and I<br>think I think many people have tried and<br>we've certainly tried<br>um the transport cost is very high here<br>the transport difficulties are high just<br>the logistics of getting these things<br>around the place but but moreover I<br>think the foreign companies and some of<br>them have been Scandinavian that have<br>come here have tried but they<br>they sort of end up going back home and<br>saying well there's just not an export<br>Market the local market isn't big enough<br>and there's no export Market to tap into<br>so it just doesn't quite support the<br>infrastructure you need to make it work<br>which I think is a great shame because<br>ultimately when I've been up there and I<br>have done it a couple of times and<br>looked at the way these factories work<br>and the efficiency with which they build<br>houses and then you come back home and<br>you see the bloke in the back of the Ute<br>and his dog in a nail bag and then a few<br>bucks puffing on a cigarette and<br>drinking a coffee it's it's like a two<br>out of ten versus a nine and a half and<br>it's a real shame but I just I'd love to<br>think that flitches are trying it and<br>I'd love to think they could make it<br>work but I I I've seen others try and go<br>back with their tails between your legs<br>it just doesn't seem and Chris does have<br>a Scandinavian wife so he has been alive<br>yeah yeah yeah I have done a few times<br>all right I'm going to go<br>I think when you remember as well that<br>um we need to think uh what's the big<br>picture where's the supply chain and<br>when we are surrounded by forests here<br>in New Zealand I know we've got plenty<br>in the Central North Island but then we<br>go and cut down that wood send it all<br>the way overseas get it back once it's<br>processed at a really expensive price we<br>need to look at word processing plants<br>just as much as we need to be looking at<br>the people who build it yeah I couldn't<br>agree more yeah all right we have just<br>come through<br>horrendous weather events and it's<br>obviously Hawke's Bay it's up through<br>Auckland it's Northland it's West Coast<br>has been enormous uh impact<br>there are questions here about managed<br>Retreat Nicola Willis touched on that<br>earlier the questions about green cities<br>but what changes now what changes post<br>the cyclone and what changes as we go<br>into an expectation of Greater extreme<br>weather events what do we need to do<br>differently that maybe wasn't on our<br>radar even a few weeks ago around the<br>durability and resilience of our<br>infrastructure<br>to come<br>because um<br>effects were interesting ones about the<br>the infrastructure investment and that<br>were in a high I'm I'm sure that at a<br>level is absolutely right in terms of<br>the dollars being spent but I think you<br>know let's be<br>um a little bit cynical in as much as<br>um a whole lot of that would have gone<br>on the likes of public transport subsidy<br>on consultancy and so on not the actual<br>bitumen and Tara and so on that we so<br>you take our transport investment New<br>Zealand the reality orbiters yes it's<br>increased year on year for a long time<br>we spend as much more as we ever had but<br>what we're spending physically isn't<br>I certainly accept you know as much as<br>it's a it's a nice catchphrase when you<br>read something behind this bill that<br>better you know I think the vast<br>majority of us wanted to<br>influence colleagues accepted<br>um except that there's a climate change<br>thing and there's these various other<br>issues that are that are that are going<br>on that that are contributing to this<br>and so there will be changed routes<br>there will be different designs but but<br>I think in the end it doesn't mean<br>Senior Transport perspective radical<br>change from what best practice was I've<br>already given you the example of State<br>Highway 1 to the north look actually if<br>you built them well it best sort of<br>practice today they will hold up very<br>well to changing weather patterns it's<br>the old dungas that we knew were old<br>dungas that happen and so I think kind<br>of just types of speculate position<br>where you know I think we've got to<br>think long term build these roads really<br>well<br>for a hundred years albeit we know that<br>we are 100 years cut has come so much<br>more quickly than it used to and I think<br>going uh back to my point around that<br>public expenditure and the reality is<br>the people that will be cleaning up the<br>impacts of the Cyclone are the local<br>councils in the local communities so<br>when we are at the whim of central<br>government hoping that they'll bail us<br>out for critical infrastructure to get<br>our roads open to get our water working<br>again I think that that's where we get<br>to a really risky situation in New<br>Zealand where again we prioritize<br>usually based on population so what are<br>our provincial areas like tight after<br>tea in the East Coast or like far north<br>how can we guarantee that they'll be<br>better off we can do that by making sure<br>that councils are funded to do the job<br>can I understand I mean I think I I was<br>interested after that the Cyclone came<br>through uh some photos that one of the<br>teams showed me of I think it was esque<br>Valley back in 1939 or 38 or some of the<br>very similar scenes in a sense so I<br>guess um I think a lot to the kapiti<br>coast where you know um there were<br>conversations around putting details on<br>them so that we know about uh what's<br>going to happen uh and and that was<br>ruled illegal and there was all sorts of<br>money being spent and similar I'm I'm<br>worried that unless the government makes<br>a very Swift and decisive call on what<br>the framework and parameters are around<br>you know manage Retreat even at a small<br>scale there<br>um we're we're just going to be destined<br>to sort of everyone doing their own<br>thing and and having no sort of<br>coordination that that's very difficult<br>because it sort of means that at some<br>point people will go back and do things<br>again and again I mean if you look even<br>at how people choose housing at the<br>moment they will look more at where<br>their school zone is than what their<br>flood zone is in<br>um that sort of information isn't well<br>utilized it isn't well understood and<br>it's certainly not put out there<br>proactively it's probably the most<br>difficult thing that people can find so<br>unless we have a decision made on it now<br>I get the risks of doing that quickly I<br>trust me I do but I think that there are<br>greater risks of just letting everyone<br>do their own thing there are people's<br>lives at stake at the moment and<br>livelihoods who are going do I actually<br>start the rebuild or not they are in<br>limbo until those decisions are made<br>they make the wrong call now and<br>government changes the rules on them<br>tomorrow they are in a very difficult<br>place so that has to be quick and I<br>think it does have to come down to the<br>those regions we'll talk about there is<br>simply no excuse for not moving very<br>quickly<br>the government has to move quickly<br>because the reality is there are<br>communities there are practical purposes<br>yet they they have very long circuitous<br>back routes they can take for practical<br>purposes those communities have had off<br>in their their Freight and uh supply<br>chain there's practically speaking um if<br>not cut off certainly very much<br>diminished and so yeah I think what I<br>think is it's short-term long term but<br>there is a real case for urgency on this<br>like now that that goes to the<br>prioritization right like State Highway<br>one through the brynduins that should be<br>absolutely the top of the priority list<br>that should be drop tools on other stuff<br>that might be maintenance but but that<br>one needs to be repaired the Northland<br>is cut off you know and you imagine if<br>if we did the same to other regions so I<br>think we've that has to be someone has<br>to draw up a list and it does have to<br>include by picking winners there you<br>will have to pick losers but if we've<br>only got x amount of resource of time<br>and money in a year to do something<br>we've got to be pretty strict at the<br>moment with this has to happen first and<br>unfortunately that means that other<br>things have to go on the back burner<br>that's the whole point of Economics is<br>the trade-offs of scarcity we this stuff<br>is scarce and we have to make a decision<br>if we don't the decision will be and is<br>being made for us all right we're going<br>to wrap up with a quick fire round<br>um and it does actually come to the core<br>of what you've touched on there this is<br>an economics Forum we're looking at<br>trade-offs and I said I'd come back to<br>prioritization<br>from your point of view in Australia<br>you're in Simon and move across um<br>what would be your priority and then two<br>lenses one what would be the project you<br>would most like to see go ahead be at<br>infrastructure energy housing and also<br>what would be the system change priority<br>you would most like to see go ahead for<br>a longer term uh I was trying to be<br>really quick look in energy and<br>Communications actually off in the free<br>market New Zealand Works incredibly well<br>government sets the setting there's more<br>than enough Capital they get on do it<br>I'm not worried about those sectors and<br>by the way they'll they'll produce the<br>right environmental and so on<br>outcomes if they're left to it and<br>they're not interfered with too much I<br>in the end yeah housing I'll let these<br>guys deal with that that's a big one<br>obviously important and transport I<br>think right now there's literally five<br>State highways that need to be fixed in<br>the upper North Island the government<br>needs to get on with that and then<br>outside of that look there'll be a a<br>scarcity prioritization process that<br>needs to be gone through I would hope<br>that actually the medical class and the<br>likes of the infrastructure commission<br>could kind of get together and not have<br>come by yeah but kind of get on and do<br>that great thank you mine's quite simple<br>it will be storm water I think we've<br>seen the impacts um with flooding and<br>not only the impact of the Cyclone but<br>stormwater is actually crucial for<br>ensuring that we can develop those new<br>homes so despite the increased weather<br>events that we do know are occurring to<br>unlock our Greenfield development for<br>the more housing for our growing<br>population we do need stormwater<br>councils cannot do that alone if we were<br>expected to fund that which we always<br>criticize for not funding it it would be<br>things like your public facilities your<br>pools your roads that would have to cut<br>off just to put those pipes to the<br>ground that you can't even see so storm<br>water please<br>Chris I think the one thing we've all<br>agreed on is there's not enough people<br>here to to do the infrastructure work<br>itself so<br>from my perspective and I deal with it<br>every day until you build more houses<br>you can't get the people here to fix the<br>infrastructure so it's a it's a very<br>circular argument so I would say you<br>know let us get rid of some of the<br>bureaucracy let us spend some of that<br>150 Grand a block that we waste on<br>paperwork to do our own infrastructure<br>and build some more houses then you can<br>immigrate enough people to actually get<br>on and fix the trunk infrastructure of<br>it so<br>desperately needed to be done but until<br>you can house them you're still going<br>nowhere<br>thank you Chris spread all of that my my<br>three if I if I if I had you know<br>unlimited uh Power one give infracom<br>more directive power so that they can<br>make those prioritization decisions and<br>and start put things forward two have<br>proper Asset Management plans across all<br>of our major infrastructure so that it's<br>not a surprise when they break<br>um and three where's the national skills<br>plan so that we've got enough water<br>technicians we've got enough building<br>Control Officers we've got those sort of<br>people I mean I can't tell you at the<br>moment how many nurses were down but I<br>know it's Lots I can't tell you how many<br>water technicians we're down but I know<br>it's lots and use that information to<br>then fund places pay people to go and<br>become water technicians because it<br>trust me if you told me when I went to<br>University that I could pay my own way<br>and become an economist or get paid to<br>become a water technician I would have<br>the second option incentives matter here<br>and if you put people down that path uh<br>you will get the results that you want<br>if you let people do whatever they want<br>without that direction without the<br>incentives you will get a smorgasbord<br>that might not be the exact mix that you<br>need I suspect that all the water<br>technicians watching the live stream<br>will be contacting info metrics about<br>job job swaps all right um I'll uh bring<br>this panel to a close um let's just put<br>our hands together for a fantastic<br>reception<br>that's right thanks for that hey thank<br>you<br>oh</p></main><footer
