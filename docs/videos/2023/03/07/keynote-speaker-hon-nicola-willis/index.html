style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I would uh now welcome to the stage<br>we've got one session before we move<br>into a lunch break where you can ask the<br>uh the other questions about the vaccine<br>procurement strategy uh but I will now<br>welcome to the stage Nicola Willis the<br>uh spokes opposition spokesperson for<br>finance and also Deputy leader of the<br>opposition welcome Nicola<br>good morning everyone I'm delighted to<br>be here at the New Zealand economics<br>Forum with you today<br>to discuss the challenges facing our<br>economy and to share Nationals plans for<br>reducing the cost of living and lifting<br>incomes for all<br>let me acknowledge the esteemed guests<br>in the room uh the right honorable Jim<br>Bulger former prime minister of New<br>Zealand I think here in that capacity<br>but also as a great dad to his son the<br>head of the waikato management school<br>and my former fonterra colleague Matt<br>Bulger of course Vice Chancellor<br>Professor Neil Quigley economists<br>Business Leaders experts students all of<br>you<br>I'm very impressed by the qualifications<br>the expertise and the experience<br>assembled at this forum<br>and so let me be candid I don't share<br>anything like the depth of formal<br>economics training that many in this<br>room today have<br>I first learned about small business<br>economics<br>and global trade not from textbooks but<br>by observing the efficiency of the<br>commercial kitchen at the Holy Bagel<br>Cafe where I worked in the early 2000s<br>through my successful and unsuccessful<br>adventures and upselling at the Wallace<br>rose clothing boutique<br>and by comparing stock lists sales<br>volumes and price points at the<br>Timberland shoe shop I once helped<br>manage<br>and I learned about what economics means<br>for households through juggling our<br>first mortgage and the child care costs<br>of our four kids<br>and by being invited into the lives of<br>new zealanders from all walks of life<br>who have had the generosity to share<br>their stories and their hopes with me<br>and I learned what matters for our<br>exporters by talking with the team at a<br>factory in Colombo Turning New Zealand<br>milk into branded consumer products<br>by watching closely as my senior<br>managers negotiated deals with global<br>food producers in Shanghai<br>and by listening to Farmers while gazing<br>out over muddy paddocks right here in<br>the waikato<br>and experiences like these have left<br>their mark on me and many of my National<br>Party colleagues<br>our team holds our economic policies to<br>the Practical tests of everyday life<br>if it won't make a meaningful positive<br>difference to shop owners and workers to<br>Everyday families and exporters then we<br>won't pursue it<br>National knows that stronger and a more<br>productive economy is ultimately driven<br>Along by people taking action by people<br>choosing to put in extra effort knowing<br>they'll be rewarded for it<br>by people applying greater skill to the<br>tasks at hand so they can be done<br>quicker and with less expense<br>by people innovating better ways to do<br>things dreaming up and delivering new<br>ideas new products new Services by<br>people making better use of the<br>resources geography and history has<br>granted us and by people selling more to<br>the world beyond our Shores<br>and as we meet here today there are many<br>practical challenges standing in the way<br>of that effort and that innovation<br>the destruction and Devastation caused<br>by Cyclone Gabriel in North Island<br>flooding are immense and I want to share<br>your recognition I'm sure of the people<br>so badly affected today<br>we owe those affected a swift recovery<br>and rebuild<br>and we owe all new zealanders the<br>assurance that we will apply the lessons<br>learned<br>at the same time the cost of living is<br>higher than it's ever been inflation has<br>now been out of the Reserve Bank target<br>range for 21 months and it isn't<br>forecast to come back down to Target for<br>another year<br>with the thief of inflation comes Rising<br>interest rates not in the effect not in<br>the history of the official cash rate<br>have new zealanders experienced such a<br>fast and Dramatic Lift in interest rates<br>such as occurred since October 2021<br>the result is that many homeowners will<br>be left scrambling this year when their<br>mortgages come up for refixing and they<br>switch from a rate with a two or a three<br>in front of it to something with a six<br>in front of it for many new zealanders<br>that difference is worth hundreds of<br>dollars a fortnight<br>the average hourly wage may be nominally<br>higher but for many people it hasn't<br>kept up with Rising prices meaning each<br>fortnight's pay gets stretched thinner<br>than the last<br>worker shortages are persisting and<br>slowing activity down from the wait for<br>your coffee to the building of New Roads<br>to the filing and filling of exporters<br>order books<br>inflation and fiscal drag have pushed<br>New Zealand workers into higher tax<br>brackets meaning typical income earners<br>are paying more tax<br>government spending has leapt up to 35<br>percent of GDP higher than it's been in<br>17 years yet look around and it's<br>difficult to find solid evidence<br>that the performance of key Frontline<br>Public Services be they hospitals or<br>schools has actually improved<br>so as we plan for the future New Zealand<br>must simultaneously fix these problems<br>end rise to Growing Global challenges<br>decarbonizing our economy<br>adapting to the more frequent severe<br>weather events that climate change is<br>bringing<br>and maintaining a secure footing in a<br>world of less stable Foreign Affairs of<br>de-globalization and growing<br>protectionism<br>so how will we do it<br>today I want to take this opportunity to<br>set out Nationals plans for fighting<br>inflation growing our economy and<br>building resilience for the future<br>we see the growing cost of living as the<br>number one economic issue for New<br>Zealand<br>people are really hurting across all<br>walks of life<br>debt areas are up queues for food banks<br>are longer anxiety about household<br>finances is rising<br>National maintains the Orthodox view<br>that the independent Reserve Bank must<br>play a leading role in this fight<br>we will return the bank to a single<br>Mandate of delivering price stability<br>with a one to three percent inflation<br>Target band<br>we will also commission an independent<br>review of the bank's performance over<br>the period 2020 to 2022 when<br>extraordinary monetary policy decisions<br>were taken<br>including a volume of quantitative<br>easing that proportionate to the size of<br>our economy put us amongst the top<br>handful of covert money printers in the<br>world<br>second<br>National well and block major supply<br>side constraints to proactive growth<br>starting by addressing worker shortages<br>we will cut through the holdups and the<br>immigration system so that businesses<br>and hospitals by the way can get the<br>workers that they need<br>now if you want to think of the human<br>face of what our immigration policies<br>have meant in recent times let me tell<br>you the story of the nurse who came<br>running up to my car and knocked on the<br>window as I waited to pick my girls up<br>from their dance class recently<br>once she'd got over the fact that I<br>don't look as good as the nice picture<br>of me on the car when I don't have my<br>makeup on on a Saturday morning and she<br>realized it was in fact me she said<br>Nicola Nicola I just want to let you<br>know I'll be voting for National for the<br>first time ever and I said well why is<br>that she said I'm a nurse<br>and we need to bring more nurses into<br>the country and you're the only ones<br>who've stood up for the green list<br>process and I said well yeah it must be<br>so hard for you having to work all those<br>extra shifts she said nope that's not it<br>I I happily do that because I started<br>nursing because I want to care for<br>people the problem is too many nights I<br>spend in tears thinking of the patients<br>who didn't get the care they deserved<br>because there's not enough of us on the<br>ward<br>third we will stop the tidal wave of new<br>costs and regulations that have added<br>more price pressure to everything from<br>food to rent case in point<br>changing the tax treatment of rental<br>properties<br>officials warned that a beehive proposal<br>to check change the tax treatment of<br>rental properties could increase rents<br>and churn for renters that is exactly<br>what has happened<br>National will back tenants and reduce<br>pressure on rents by restoring interest<br>deductibility for rental properties and<br>taking the brightline test back to two<br>years<br>while we're at it we'll also remove the<br>UT tax the Auckland Regional fuel tax<br>and the proposed aptex that increase the<br>prices people pay for vehicles petrol<br>and soon the Airbnb and Uber Eats too<br>fourth National well-restored discipline<br>to government spending<br>this will help ease the pressure on<br>inflation in interest rates that has<br>been exacerbated by loose for school<br>policy it will increase the focus on<br>results for money spent and it will<br>allow our government to reduce the tax<br>burden on new zealanders<br>I want to spend some time on this point<br>of disciplined spending because it is<br>very important<br>government spending is up a billion<br>dollars a week since labor took office<br>in 2017.<br>in the last Financial year government's<br>been encrypt up to 35 percent of our<br>economic output a higher level than<br>we've seen in at least 17 years<br>worse new zealanders simply aren't being<br>delivered value for the dollars taxed<br>and spent<br>from elective surgery to emergency care<br>to social housing waiting lists are<br>bigger and waiting times longer<br>whether it's the stalled Auckland Light<br>Rail Project the excruciatingly slow<br>Dunedin Hospital build<br>or the 100 in 76 supposedly shovel ready<br>projects began with covert mini yet<br>still not completed<br>infrastructure is not getting built in a<br>timely way<br>and the Minister of Finance chose 2022 a<br>year when inflation ran at a 30-year<br>high as the time to introduce the<br>biggest spending budget in New Zealand<br>history<br>National sees plenty of evidence that<br>this large yes has enabled an<br>ill-disciplined approach to government<br>spending here's a few examples I think<br>of<br>the huge growth and the core Public<br>Service it's not the front line workers<br>the teachers and the nurses but those<br>are in the back room roles with ten<br>thousand plus additional public servants<br>being hired into non-frontline roles<br>such as policy advice HR and<br>Communications<br>even while at the same time consultancy<br>fees and I'm sure there's some wonderful<br>people from Deloitte and PWC and such<br>here today<br>but those fees have leapt to around<br>1.7 billion dollars a year<br>Millions upon Millions have been spent<br>on projects such as the tvnzr NZ merger<br>the failed tepukingha reforms and the<br>social insurance scheme proposal<br>only for some of those projects to be<br>put on ice as the political temperature<br>has heated up<br>I think of the decision to forge ahead<br>with a 30 billion dollar Auckland Light<br>Rail Project even while hundreds of<br>kilometers of uh Regional roads need<br>urgent repairs and as Helen Clark so<br>rightly pointed out on Twitter recently<br>even while we know that the thing would<br>that would best enable lower carbon<br>transport are for many aucklanders is in<br>fact a more reliable and frequent bus<br>service<br>and I think of the willingness to fund<br>hundreds of millions of dollars and<br>frankly corporate welfare for large<br>firms using funds raised by the<br>emissions trading scheme and ultimately<br>paid for by everyday taxpayers<br>so National's commitment is to deliver<br>more value for government spending by<br>prioritizing beta seating clear Public<br>Service targets and holding government<br>agencies accountable for their results<br>well we're at it we'll cut through the<br>complexity of government Social Services<br>provision with a social investment<br>approach that will drive more<br>responsibility to the community<br>organizations whose work has just been<br>applauded by that panel on stage this<br>morning<br>finally our part of National's approach<br>to the cost of living is to reduce the<br>rising tax burden that has made it<br>harder for new zealanders to keep up<br>with Rising prices<br>tax revenue has jumped an eye-watering<br>43 billion dollars a year over the past<br>five years helped Along by rampant<br>inflation it's handmaiden fiscal drag<br>and a clutch of new taxes<br>that extra tax take and I know you're<br>mostly numbers people in this room but<br>43 billion dollars doesn't make much<br>sense to the average person but that<br>extra take tax tag is equivalent to 17<br>500 per household<br>and despite the claims of prime minister<br>Hipkins core Crown tax revenue is now a<br>higher proportion of the economy than it<br>has been for many years exceeding 30<br>percent of GDP and the last Financial<br>year a level not reached since labor was<br>last in office<br>in the past few years as I say rampant<br>inflation has acted as a secret tax hike<br>on every New Zealander paying income tax<br>with higher nominal incomes pushing<br>even while the purchasing power has<br>dragged behind so last year our national<br>party leader Chris luxon put out a fully<br>costed specific proposal to adjust tax<br>brackets<br>the changes he proposed would increase<br>the income level at which the 17.5<br>percent 30 percent and 33 tax rates<br>would kick in<br>the proposed changes will deliver<br>someone in the median wage on the median<br>wage of fifty five thousand dollars a<br>year eight hundred dollars a year in tax<br>relief someone on the average wage would<br>be better off by 870 a year while anyone<br>earning seventy eight thousand dollars<br>uh or more would benefit from around uh<br>well from exactly one thousand and forty<br>three dollars a year<br>supernutants would also benefit super is<br>indexed to the average after tax wage<br>and because our tax changes will<br>increase average after tax wages super<br>payments for a couple would increase by<br>around 500 or 540 a year<br>now National can afford these tax<br>commitments because of our commitment to<br>disciplined government spending and we<br>do hope to deliver more tax reduction<br>Beyond this but only if fiscal and<br>economic conditions permit<br>our fiscal strategy will balance the<br>need to invest in resilient<br>future-proofed infrastructure and to<br>chart a path back to Surplus and debt<br>reduction<br>it is possible to do this without adding<br>new taxes<br>I think of the example of John key in<br>Bill English and the work they did to<br>get New Zealand's books back in order<br>after the GFC and the Canterbury quakes<br>their government rightly increased<br>borrowing to support people through the<br>hard times ensuring a strong social<br>safety net for people who lost their<br>jobs when the global economy tanked<br>increasing funding for health and<br>education even while tax revenues fell<br>and investing carefully in the<br>Canterbury rebuild<br>if National is elected to lead the<br>government this year we will honor our<br>party's Legacy of strong economic<br>management<br>ultimately I believe<br>that the best way to increase<br>Investments on the front line Public<br>Services New zealanders need and deserve<br>is to provide resilience and to provide<br>growth productive sustainable low<br>inflation growth doesn't just happen<br>it isn't created by government task<br>forces and committees no matter how well<br>intentioned they are<br>instead government policy must create<br>the conditions that will maximize the<br>contribution each individual New<br>Zealander can make and will choose to<br>make<br>so Nationals prescription for stronger<br>economic growth can be summer summarized<br>in five key areas number one<br>it starts with education<br>education is the greatest equalizer the<br>state can bestow the most reliable<br>ticket to a better future and a strong<br>predictor of the quality of life a child<br>will have access to<br>and in a world of challenging<br>demographics of Greater automation of AI<br>and competitive Global labor markets New<br>Zealand simply must do better at<br>ensuring our own citizens have the<br>greatest skills and knowledge needed to<br>do the jobs of today and tomorrow<br>and it should be of grave concern to<br>everyone in this room<br>that by many measures New Zealand school<br>students today are less numerate<br>and less literate than they once were<br>and that's not only relative to students<br>from many of the countries we like to<br>compare ourselves with but even more<br>worryingly that's compared to New<br>Zealand students of past decades<br>rather than doing better for the next<br>Generation we are doing worse<br>that is a moral failure it is a social<br>failure and it is a future economic<br>disaster<br>so National will get back to basics in<br>our schools we will sit and report on<br>clear achievement expectations and we<br>will cut the bureaucracy to put<br>employers back at the center of Applied<br>training<br>second we will deliver the<br>infrastructure that New Zealand needs to<br>support future growth resilience and<br>zero carbon connectivity<br>that means working much more effectively<br>with the private sector viewing them as<br>our friends not our enemies<br>offering more flexibility in the way<br>that we Finance big projects and<br>sequencing those projects with greater<br>coordination and foresight<br>crucially it means getting our<br>consenting regime right we are concerned<br>that the government's proposed Resource<br>Management act Replacements May in fact<br>be worse than the status quo with one<br>submitter confirming the changes would<br>make it harder not easier to consent<br>wind farms that cannot stand<br>third we will Turbo Charge The<br>Innovation engine backing firms to<br>embrace productivity enhancing<br>technology<br>easing access to global Capital that<br>will allow new Ventures to expand and<br>flourish and remaining open to the<br>talent and skills immigrants can bring<br>fourth we will stop the tidal wave of<br>mostly well-meaning But ultimately<br>destructive regulation that has come to<br>smother too many business owners from<br>the triple CFA which has strangled<br>access to credit particularly for low<br>income and low wealth individuals<br>to the so-called Fair pay legislation<br>which is set to tie hundreds of<br>otherwise productive people down and<br>negotiating rooms even when many of the<br>employees don't want to be part of it<br>to the prescriptive farming regulations<br>that defy practicality and ignore<br>Regional reality<br>sometimes I'm asked how can you quantify<br>New Zealand's growing regulatory burden<br>what's your proof point<br>and they're hard to find but perhaps the<br>best measure is the hours that small<br>business owners tell me they now spend<br>at their kitchen table with the lamp on<br>responding to the latest compliance<br>email from a government Department<br>those hours at night spent on compliance<br>are not spent working on the business<br>they are hours not spent nabbing a new<br>customer hours not spent with family<br>those are the hours that the national<br>government will work hard to give back<br>finally National will keep strengthening<br>our connections to the World building on<br>existing trading Partnerships and easing<br>the door open to new ones<br>our view is that New Zealand must<br>diversify the places we sell to and<br>extract more value for the selling that<br>we do and New Zealand must not be Inward<br>and insular we must be outward looking<br>and globally minded and that means<br>continually seeking to compete with the<br>rest of the world<br>by that measure we are currently<br>slipping last year New Zealand suffered<br>the biggest drop in rankings among 63<br>countries compared on measures of their<br>competitiveness including technology<br>science and business productivity<br>I see that as a warning Bell and if<br>policy makers don't react then we are<br>accepting a slide backwards for our<br>country and its people<br>let me close the speech by saying what<br>makes me fundamentally optimistic about<br>New Zealand's prospects<br>that's because the strengths that we<br>have as an economy are almost exactly<br>the strengths countries will need to<br>succeed in the changing world of coming<br>decades<br>in a world of growing food and security<br>we already feed 40 million people and we<br>have huge opportunities to get more<br>value for the sustainable carbon<br>efficient nutritious food we produce<br>and a world Desperately Seeking to<br>transition away from fossil fuels and<br>towards renewable energy we already<br>depend on largely renewable electricity<br>and with the right approach to<br>consenting we have the ability to<br>produce much more abundant renewable<br>energy we have the resources to<br>Electrify New Zealand<br>and in a world increasingly nervous<br>about conflict and Border disputes we<br>remain an independent nation committed<br>to the rules-based international order<br>and quite simply our country has the<br>best people in the world hard-working<br>community-minded Innovative<br>entrepreneurial<br>new zealanders are our economies magic<br>ingredient<br>so Nationals economic management<br>approach and closing will back all those<br>kiwis working hard all those people<br>doing double shifts early mornings late<br>nights and weekends<br>we will back the new zealanders fueled<br>by our shared determination to provide<br>for their families and do well by their<br>kids and we will stand with all the new<br>zealanders who want to get ahead under<br>their own steam people are at the heart<br>of Nationals policies and I know that<br>they will be at the heart of the<br>discussions here today<br>as the university says I wish you well<br>for the Forum I thank you again for this<br>audience and I look forward to your<br>questions<br>thank you so as before there are roaming<br>mics if you'd like to ask a question<br>please just raise a hand one of the team<br>will bring a microphone to you and I've<br>got some here I see one question here<br>and then I'll go to the slido so I can<br>Gilda Nicola Peter rice from clearpoint<br>advisors I'm actually a London firm<br>um possibly that's why we have a little<br>more red tape these days I think there's<br>probably too many British advisors<br>coming over from previous governments<br>um Nicola look I I liked what you were<br>saying but I'd really like to hear more<br>about an industrial strategy about r d<br>all these sorts of things and we've I<br>did a report with a group of others five<br>six years ago New Zealand was in well<br>into relative decline already<br>how are you actually going to reverse<br>that because that I think is our biggest<br>issue and maybe an example is that and I<br>live in a farming community so I love my<br>Farmer neighbors but you know you look<br>at the export revenues coming out of<br>tech and services and maybe we don't<br>have to feed 40 million people maybe we<br>can just work on selling services which<br>are much friendlier to our environment<br>and we can still enjoy<br>night they came here because they wanted<br>something better and I agree it's much<br>better here<br>um<br>wellingtonian<br>sometimes as a<br>but I'm really proud that our city is<br>the home to zero to trade me to multiple<br>software as a service firms that have<br>shown that we can export world-leading<br>technology and Innovation and create<br>jobs and incomes out of it<br>equally When I visit our Farms<br>the most successful and productive<br>farmers are applying world-class<br>Innovation research and Technology you<br>know the reason zesbury's exports are in<br>such demand is because we've had the<br>best plant breeding program and we're<br>offering Innovative fruit to the world<br>so long may that continue<br>when it comes to our Innovation and<br>research and Technology policies we've<br>set a woman known for her feistiness and<br>tenacity onto the task one Judith<br>Collins and look she has been hugely<br>energized by going and talking to those<br>involved in the tech world and if I were<br>to summarize the thoughts that she's<br>bringing to us that will inform the<br>policy will announce uh shortly in fact<br>we we know that there can be a lot of<br>discussion about the government science<br>system and The Innovation architecture<br>that's a top-down approach we need to<br>instead have a bottom-up approach that<br>says what will enable that small<br>employer that farmer that small exporter<br>to take up the technology that will make<br>them more productive how do we ensure<br>they are able to make those Capital<br>Investments able to access the capital<br>have access to an innovation system<br>that's actually delivering to their real<br>needs we see a lot of potential to do<br>better so I look forward to discussing<br>it more with you<br>Toyota thank you and I'll go to the<br>screen now but please keep any other<br>questions coming so we're just a few<br>weeks out we're fresh in the recovery<br>from extreme weather events uh<br>how would a national-led government make<br>New Zealand more resilient to more<br>extreme weather events and what role do<br>you see or does the party see for<br>central government in discussions of<br>managed retreat<br>thank you for the question because I<br>think these are issues that are top of<br>Mind across the country today and as we<br>look at the terrible of events that have<br>unfolded in Auckland and Gisborne and<br>Northland and Hawkes Bay and elsewhere<br>coromandel uh I think there's a few<br>elements the first is we do I think need<br>to take another look at our emergency<br>response mechanisms<br>of course we're still focused on that<br>response but there is going to need to<br>be a review of where things weren't<br>ready whether that's the river<br>monitoring whether that's flood warnings<br>whether that's a communication systems<br>and how they operate when there's no<br>electricity all of that needs to be<br>re-evaluated and we need to do a better<br>job there<br>second bit is about where we build and<br>what infrastructure we have connecting<br>our communities and our people and<br>National looks at that in two ways the<br>First on that question of where we build<br>where we exclude from building due to<br>Natural Hazard risk or where we<br>discourage building because of natural<br>Hazard risks we realize there's one of<br>those very nutty problems where you have<br>both the potential moral hazard of<br>stepping in where insurers already have<br>a critical role you also have potential<br>issues of fairness and that any decision<br>made in one locality must be widely<br>applicable across the country<br>and it's because of that nuttiness and<br>the need for these to be uh<br>decisions that cross multiple<br>governments that we have supported Todd<br>Muller to engage in discussions uh with<br>James Shaw our climate change<br>spokesperson with the climate change<br>minister to look at those questions of<br>managed retreat the second part is how<br>do we deliver infrastructure because I<br>put to you the discussion about climate<br>change adaptation and resilience should<br>not be one about who has the bigger<br>checkbook because checkbooks aren't<br>actually the barrier it's about who's<br>got the plan to deliver it and it's our<br>view that New Zealand needs to be much<br>smarter about both prioritizing our<br>infrastructure Investments committing to<br>a long-term timeline and sequencing<br>those building projects so that firms<br>workers experts want to come and commit<br>themselves to being part of our<br>long-term infrastructure pipeline so our<br>infrastructure spokesperson Chris Bishop<br>is working very hard on that<br>Christians just uh<br>come in related to cost of living so did<br>you not consider a tax threshold or<br>perhaps removing GST on food is better<br>to help with the cost of living crisis<br>given median income here is fifty five<br>thousand dollars<br>uh look um I can't go to a public<br>meeting in New Zealand without<br>considering that question uh because<br>it's certainly something that occurs to<br>people because the most obvious cost of<br>living crunch is when you go to the<br>supermarket and you look at the price of<br>broccoli or cabbage and I'll really<br>admit it's eye watering and really<br>difficult for many families<br>the challenge with doing a GST change of<br>that sort is twofold first there's no<br>guarantee that all of the GST reduction<br>will be passed on to the Shopper or the<br>consumer so there is a real risk there<br>the second issue of course is that in a<br>sense it's quite a regressive way of<br>addressing tax and that those who buy<br>more vegetables at the high Market<br>um you know more Wilsons and the like<br>are going to end up getting more tax<br>reduction than lower income people and<br>finally the tax purists here will<br>understand that New Zealand's commitment<br>to a broad-based GST system with the<br>minimum of exclusions technicality and<br>complexity has served us quite well as<br>the Australians with their books full of<br>whether it's a cooked chicken or an<br>uncooked chicken and what the tax<br>treatment should be would attest<br>uh so we are very conscious uh that food<br>is a massive cost of living pressure and<br>that's one of the reasons why Todd<br>Muller our agricultural spokesperson is<br>on a mission to identify those<br>regulations that have added to the cost<br>burden on our farmers in recent years<br>such that those costs are being passed<br>on to New Zealand shoppers<br>thank you and<br>um<br>referencing another area of costs there<br>are a couple of questions I'll put<br>together here so one is that you focused<br>on fiscal discipline in your speech but<br>didn't reference Cyclone recovery how<br>would National think about funding that<br>but there's also a question around water<br>infrastructure very topical uh we hear<br>rates won't increase but there'll be use<br>of debt how would that be funded and of<br>course those two things might be the<br>same<br>uh well I may have spoken too fast but I<br>certainly did reference Cyclone recovery<br>we see that as a critical part of both<br>the immediate uh spending priorities for<br>New Zealand but also the medium-term<br>infrastructure uh building that's going<br>to have to go on we see Cyclone recovery<br>as being both the immediate response to<br>get communities and families back on<br>their feet but also about restoring<br>those connections whether it's the 15<br>bridges that are down whether it's<br>making sure that telecommunications are<br>more resilient in the future so as I set<br>out our viewers that if we are being<br>disciplined about our books elsewhere<br>then there is a case for borrowing for<br>those long-term Investments so long as<br>we pl chart a path back to Surplus<br>certainly that is the approach that key<br>in English took after the Canterbury<br>Quakes and I think what they<br>demonstrated was it is possible to be<br>very careful about those rebuild<br>Investments while also charting a path<br>back to Surplus second question is about<br>water infrastructure<br>and some of you will have seen that we<br>have announced our alternative approach<br>to the government's proposed three<br>Waters reforms<br>our approach acknowledges uh that New<br>Zealand is underdone on our water<br>infrastructure investment that we need<br>to do much better in the future we see<br>the way forward not as taking control<br>and ownership away from local<br>communities who don't wish to give that<br>control and ownership away and not to be<br>creating new centralized Mega<br>bureaucracies with complex co-governance<br>structures around them<br>but instead to say we want from<br>henceforth have a water regulator in<br>fact we accept the government's model<br>there that will set quality standards we<br>will also have an economic regulator<br>that will require councils to<br>demonstrate they have a 30-year plan for<br>investing in their water infrastructure<br>and that they have a finance plan for<br>raising the revenue to support those<br>Investments<br>we've put forward a structure which<br>would allow councils to more readily<br>work together to put those plans<br>together with regional controlled<br>organizations in which no council has<br>more than 50 percent share it will be<br>much more possible for councils to<br>access the long-term funding and finance<br>that they have lacked access to in the<br>past and that has stopped many of them<br>from making these longer-term<br>Investments<br>thank you question Adrian Nicola thank<br>you for those comments I wondered if I<br>could just broaden out a little bit and<br>pick up on your last comment about<br>30-year view because I think if we if we<br>look around the world there's a strong<br>sense that demography is Destiny for<br>many countries and uh superpowers of<br>many countries around the world as being<br>a place where skilled migrants want to<br>come and work if I then pick up on your<br>themes around the need to invest in<br>these critical bits of infrastructure<br>which I totally agree with how do we<br>start to have a a more open discussion<br>about what is our strategy for New<br>Zealand for a population point of view<br>how do we get the right people here and<br>how big do we want to be in the future I<br>note that in Australia it's quite an<br>open discussion between political<br>parties left and right<br>but it seems to be the unspoken topic<br>here but if we were able to have that<br>conversation about the right kind of<br>migrants that we wanted on a yield by<br>year basis business could start to build<br>up the scale could respond on an annual<br>basis we could get the houses built in<br>the right way and then we could have the<br>infrastructure we truly want in a<br>country that's long and thin in the<br>future so could you just talk a little<br>bit more about a longer term view on<br>immigration and how that's important for<br>this<br>yeah um thanks for the question because<br>I agree demography is one of the major<br>challenges for New Zealand many<br>countries around the world over the<br>coming decades<br>and when I think about that issue it's<br>just abundantly clear to me that we are<br>going to have to<br>include in our plans welcoming people<br>with the skills and talent we need from<br>other countries uh in the world<br>and I think it's a great shame that in<br>these past couple of years while other<br>countries such as Canada or in Australia<br>and others have been rolling out the<br>welcome mat to Skilled foreigners New<br>Zealand has been putting up the stop<br>sign<br>and that seems a very bad message<br>in our view is that it's going to get<br>harder not easier to attract skilled<br>workers in the future<br>so the conversation we want to have is<br>this isn't in either or it's not train<br>and educate your own people or import<br>from overseas it has to be both<br>because when we allow more skilled<br>workers to fill the gaps in our own<br>businesses and public services we're<br>then able to better educate our own<br>people and provide them more<br>opportunities so the discussion we would<br>like to have is about what New Zealand<br>needs to have the industries the growth<br>and the services that new zealanders<br>expect and the conversation we would<br>like to have is one that stops these<br>tropes that immigrants are somehow<br>taking from us<br>when actually all of the evidence and<br>research says they give to us<br>and I want to thank business New Zealand<br>for their work which has highlighted<br>these demographic issues and their<br>recent publication and I want to say<br>just for the record that I think<br>immigrants are important not only in an<br>economic sense but I believe that<br>successive waves of immigration have<br>enriched our society our communities and<br>who we are as a country<br>thank you I will do my brief plug for<br>welcoming International students back<br>into the country it's brilliant to have<br>them here and on that it'll be our last<br>question but I'm going to stay on<br>education you started<br>your discussion on plans for growth with<br>education<br>this is a university if you walk out<br>over lunch you'll see a lot of bright<br>young people with amazing Futures in<br>front of them you've touched on some of<br>those points but what would we expect to<br>see<br>is the outcomes after uh take a period<br>take three years what outcomes do you<br>want to see change and how would<br>National achieve those outcomes in<br>education<br>look this is an area I'm passionate<br>about and Chris luxon and I spend lots<br>of hours talking about because he's very<br>passionate about it too you know the the<br>first time I interviewed for a job uh<br>with the national party I was asked<br>which portfolio are you interested in<br>researching I said education because if<br>the state gets education right that is<br>the tool that will allow us to liberate<br>people from circumstances of<br>disadvantage so there's actually a great<br>Duty for the state to ensure that when<br>it is providing public education that is<br>doing a good job of it<br>and so the outcome that I see<br>is that we will actually address this<br>growing gap between students who go to<br>schools of lower socioeconomic<br>communities and students who go to<br>schools and higher socioeconomic<br>opportunity communities because if you<br>look at the stats today<br>actually it's middle class and upper<br>class kids who are hoovering up<br>interest-free student loans because<br>they're the ones who have the<br>qualifications to enter tertiary<br>institutions<br>we're still doing a huge disservice to<br>many children who don't leave school<br>with the Reading Writing or math skills<br>needed to even access the most basic<br>apprenticeship<br>so I would measure our performance on<br>education by how many more children are<br>achieving Reading Writing and math<br>skills that allow them to participate in<br>the modern world and are we closing the<br>Gap so that we can truly say that the<br>State education system is providing for<br>people no matter their background<br>thank you all right<br>um we will close it there and move on<br>into lunch so first why don't we just</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
