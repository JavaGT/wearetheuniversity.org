Featuring Sir Maarten Wevers (former NZ diplomat and public servant), Anne Tolley (Commissioner for Tauranga City Council), and Graham Scott (Director at Sapere Research Group; former public servant).</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>but where we're moving to now is is<br>public sector and of course a robust and<br>well-functioning public sector is<br>something that often we don't notice<br>that when things are going well and I<br>think<br>um it's when things go wrong that we<br>really notice the importance of this<br>robust<br>um and um transparent public sector so<br>this session is going to be taking a<br>look at the public sector in New Zealand<br>including the extent to which we are<br>still world class<br>um we've got three great panelists who<br>all know each other and and have been<br>having lots of conversations so we'll<br>direct those conversations to our our<br>audience now our first panelists will be<br>sir Martin Weaver's delighted to have<br>him along uh here former New Zealand<br>Diplomat and Senior public servant<br>bringing a wealth of experience from<br>those roles then we have Graham Scott<br>former secretary to the treasury former<br>New Zealand productivity commissioner<br>and antoli a commissioner for Tauranga<br>City Council former MP and government<br>minister so all names that are known<br>quite well to many of us so with that<br>please<br>um great pleasure to be here and to<br>share the platform with uh Graham and<br>Anne<br>um I found it all a bit depressing so<br>far so um when I mentioned that uh to<br>Anna she said are you going to live and<br>up and make it more positive I said well<br>no but you know when lots of problems<br>are put in front of you you know the the<br>natural solutions to say well the<br>natural question is to say well how can<br>these be fixed and that's a really<br>really good uh question to ask<br>um<br>the session is a robust public sector<br>are we still world class<br>the inference that it seems to me we're<br>being invited to draw of course at some<br>stage in the past we did have a<br>world-class public sector<br>I don't think personally I don't know<br>what the other thing that that was ever<br>true uh certainly not across the board<br>but there were certain periods in our<br>past and I was just saying to the Graeme<br>if you go back to the 1890s with uh<br>labor market and then uh<br>1930s with welfare state there were<br>areas where New Zealand was really<br>innovative<br>and earned a reputation and delivered on<br>significant social or economic reforms<br>that then were emulated and have been<br>vetted in and have been very successful<br>the question is are we still in that<br>sort of space or not what I'd like to<br>say is it's quite important here to<br>distinguish between our Democratic<br>systems and our Public public sector<br>although they're closely linked because<br>it's certainly true uh that in New<br>Zealand we enjoy one of the most stable<br>and long-standing open uh and<br>unchallenged democracies globally and<br>that's something to be really really uh<br>grateful for our national institutions<br>are broadly stable they run by the rule<br>of law we have an independent Judiciary<br>by and large we have a very trusted<br>police force which is true in very few<br>places in the world<br>and we have regular and uninterrupted<br>and peaceful transfers of democratic<br>power so you know a lot of people would<br>give everything to get that sort of<br>package if they could<br>and some areas we work very well I think<br>of the office of the auditor general<br>which is a very robust and long-standing<br>office<br>um<br>and as chair I think of Transparency<br>International New Zealand<br>um I think this year we're second in the<br>world we have been first for a number of<br>years<br>um that's independently<br>um done and there are a number of other<br>measures like that about trust in<br>government and government institutions a<br>very high compared internationally and<br>it's also true that apparently a lot of<br>the democracies at the moment are under<br>pressure and Trust in government has<br>diminished quite sharply uh over the<br>covert period around democracies uh I<br>think it's probably a little too early<br>to say what the score is with trust and<br>government in New Zealand because the<br>data is probably not out but certainly<br>there are a lot of positives in our<br>system<br>but it seems to me that the organizers<br>imposing this question<br>um<br>suggest that they're worried about the<br>nature and the quality of advice<br>that's going from officials of which<br>Graham and I were both long-standing<br>officials giving to ministers and in<br>cabinet processes or perhaps the nature<br>and the quality and the direction of<br>decisions being taken by ministers and<br>the executive or agency Chief Executives<br>of the boards of state and Enterprise or<br>crown entities I think it's really<br>important also to distinguish between<br>the robust institutions I've talked<br>about which I think<br>you know they're by and large good they<br>can all be improved with the board level<br>or you know you'll have ministers who<br>are better than others and chief<br>executives are better than others and<br>all that sort of stuff but taking that<br>all are the worst the systems operate<br>reasonably strongly<br>um but the question is<br>um<br>what can we do uh to improve that and<br>how do you do that now the the peak<br>bodies for dealing with our public<br>sector uh uh and guiding it of course uh<br>the National Institution of is the<br>National Institution of the parliament<br>and from the parliament<br>um the team that becomes the cabinet<br>because they enjoy the confidence of the<br>house they are charged with trying to<br>coordinate all of the aspects of the<br>State uh in this country which is the<br>broad term of the public sector so and<br>that's literally hundreds of<br>organizations I mean we all know we've<br>got two and a half thousand secondary<br>schools or schools but there are<br>organizations Ministries departments<br>departmental agencies<br>a range of diverse service providers<br>locally we've got local government of<br>course we've got Regulatory Agencies<br>and essential Democratic and judicial<br>institutions<br>finding alignment cohesion and as<br>current solar Forest Secretary of the uh<br>Ministry of Education just to say her<br>job in the education department<br>is to keep the herd moving roughly West<br>and I always rather like that expression<br>because it's not quite like herding cats<br>but it's not far off it and that's<br>really I'm sure the role that Jim Bolger<br>and others of his colleagues have when<br>they were sitting at the cabinet table<br>this is a beer moth and it's really<br>quite difficult and extremely daunting<br>to work out what to address and when so<br>it seems to me from the time that I've<br>spent working<br>just over 10 years in the Beehive and<br>seeing and Advising ministers and prime<br>ministers at very close quarters<br>um<br>and as Graham I'm sure will notice that<br>focusing on some key planks and doing<br>them well and consistently over years<br>really paid dividends the taxation<br>reforms of the 80s<br>the state-owned Enterprise reforms uh<br>the whole liberation of Agriculture from<br>the regular regulations that they had to<br>make them<br>um you know responsive and live on their<br>own wits and with Africa very important<br>and improved part of our economic life<br>and that really devolved from a decision<br>strategically to look at agriculture<br>completely differently so those sorts of<br>big things are big multiplier so<br>thinking of the conversation we've had<br>today if somehow through the agencies<br>that have responsibility for the<br>education system the immigration system<br>and the fiscal system which are<br>conversations that have come up already<br>today if we could get those humming a<br>lot of other things would fall into<br>place naturally so the challenge for uh<br>the the leaders in the public sector<br>which are essentially the cabinet<br>uh how to work out which of those issues<br>to pick and what advice they should<br>receive and then what decisions they<br>should make and there's a big difference<br>between provision of policy advice which<br>was our domain and making the decisions<br>which were the domain that Jim and Anne<br>were in and they often get conflated in<br>the public mind<br>um<br>I'd make the point that the way in which<br>the Westminster system operates in New<br>Zealand I think it's it's now quite<br>different from the way it originally<br>started in the UK and certainly the way<br>it runs now<br>um so Jim bulge would be horrified at<br>the way they run the British cabinet<br>system<br>um and as we saw the Prime Minister of<br>Australia recently in secret appointed<br>himself to several portfolios without<br>telling anybody I don't know how the<br>cabinet secretary there could sleep at<br>night or uh in any others and the<br>Canadians have a very strange view of<br>the way these things run so it's pretty<br>tight the New Zealand cabinet runs with<br>only cabinet ministers in the in the<br>room<br>um when there's meeting in full<br>with one official who was somebody who<br>worked in the department I used to hit<br>the cabinet secretary and that's there<br>to act as a sort of a as a corporate<br>secretary for the process<br>um but it's politicians alone who are<br>making the decisions that's quite<br>unusual in the Westminster system<br>bringing officials into those<br>conversations all the time changes the<br>dynamic and changes the responsibility<br>for taking the tough calls that's a<br>great strength in our system but the<br>issues are hard<br>it's not an easy job in fact it's an<br>extremely difficult job being the Prime<br>Minister even of this country most of<br>the issues that we have are the same<br>that bigger countries with bigger<br>resources uh also have to Grapple with<br>we don't have the military heft or the<br>economic heft or the scientific heft<br>that others have because of our scale<br>and we have wonderful attributes because<br>of the place we live in but they're also<br>as we know things from the turinive<br>distance so the challenges are real and<br>they Bubble Up and then things happen<br>like Cyclones like earthquakes like<br>recessions and those they all put<br>pressure on the institutions and they<br>divert the public sector from what they<br>thought was their day job into<br>responding to a to a crisis so uh in<br>terms of are we still world class as<br>I've said I don't think we ever were<br>across the system there are some areas<br>where we did really well but then we go<br>off the boil of it so it's time to get<br>things back on the boil the questions<br>would be which<br>um<br>for my mind I think there's been a lack<br>of a reduction of focus<br>I think the the butter has been spread<br>too thinly that there's been a lack of<br>focus on the things that really matter<br>the ones that would have big multiplier<br>effects and I think again education<br>immigration are two that have already<br>come up today<br>um I think there's a lack of urgency<br>uh<br>in the way in which a lot of the public<br>sector agencies uh respond to changes of<br>circumstances uh I was<br>I was at dpmc when we had the Canterbury<br>earthquake so I was leading the<br>emergency response from The Beehive<br>bunker literally for days on end and<br>hearing<br>um Rob talk today about the um the<br>inability or the growing inability of<br>the health system to listen to and<br>respond to offers<br>which were well-grounded of enormous<br>Goodwill from the community and the<br>business Community to try and help with<br>the covert response I found deeply<br>disheartening<br>I think there's a general issue<br>that openness to external voices<br>is not as strong as it should be<br>um in the system that is providing<br>advice and that can be improved I think<br>we have far too many uh portfolios<br>far too many public service<br>organizations in the in the state sector<br>I think in the local government area we<br>still have too many small councils<br>numerous councils with only ten thousand<br>rate payers and critical mass is really<br>lacking there is of course a legitimate<br>political economy discussion about the<br>level of representation<br>between<br>over centralization in one hand and too<br>many small entities on the other and<br>that's that's a really difficult thing<br>but I remember the time before the 1986<br>I think it was local government reforms<br>when we had 300 local councils in New<br>Zealand I Come From The Wider upper<br>there were separate councils for<br>greytown for martinborough for<br>featherston and for masterton<br>um now they're down to three but it's<br>only one down and they should probably<br>only have one so we're not as bad as we<br>used to be but we certainly have great<br>scope for improving further so<br>um I think I'd just leave it there there<br>were a lot of things that um came to<br>mind in those discussions uh the role in<br>the public sector offered us to deal<br>with a strange combinations of I would<br>say mundane but I don't want to devalue<br>them regular day-to-day Services which<br>support the lives of citizens whether<br>it's about paying taxes<br>or providing uh regular services for<br>everything that everybody does all the<br>time including infrastructure<br>electricity all that sort of stuff<br>things that we just expect to happen and<br>generally in this country they do happen<br>um then there are all the pressures for<br>when there are crises and I think we've<br>seen again in Hawke's Bay uh and<br>certainly in Canterbury and in other<br>occasions when this community still does<br>have a lot of social capital and it can<br>pull together and then we see a lot of<br>people who are employed in the public<br>sector at local or Central level<br>um going well above and beyond and<br>delivering to their communities as we<br>all expect them to do and that's<br>something for which we're all eternally<br>grateful<br>but making sure that those entities are<br>designed appropriately and resourced<br>appropriately to handle both the regular<br>stuff and continuous Improvement and new<br>technology and all that sort of stuff<br>and being ready for Ben the big wave<br>comes across which is normally<br>unexpected it doesn't happen where you<br>think<br>um it's a really tricky balance and of<br>course the whole thing which I haven't<br>even mentioned comes with cost and then<br>the really big question about value for<br>money and I think there's a real<br>question to be asked now about how much<br>value are we getting for a lot of the<br>services that are being undertaken in<br>our name<br>where does the balance lie between<br>policy advice the crown entities the<br>ministers and how proposals for<br>improvement are made and how decisions<br>are taken I mean we could have several<br>more sessions on that but it's not easy<br>to leave with that rhetorical and we'll<br>pass that over let's pass it over to<br>Graham and see how um see how Graham<br>comes up with Solutions yeah well look<br>thank you I agree with Martin that<br>there's a lot to be pleased about with<br>the New Zealand public sector by<br>comparison with its peers but frankly<br>that's not saying much these days<br>um it's um there is a lot and you can<br>see a recitation of this and the work<br>that the Public Service Commission<br>published in December which recites a<br>lot of positive things about the public<br>service but this topic sets a higher bar<br>than that are we world class and I would<br>agree with Martin that we have been in<br>some places at some times which means<br>are we there today and the places we<br>ought to be and I'll resist the<br>temptation to make wild generalizations<br>because I only look at the public sector<br>from the outside these days so talk<br>about three things I know something<br>about and see if there is a<br>generalization from that well my three<br>topics are policy capability fiscal<br>institutions and the use of data<br>on policy capability I suggest we lack<br>deep continuing and productive policy<br>analysis on some of the major problems<br>that New Zealand faces<br>there's a risk of group think which I<br>see some of around the public service<br>there seems to be a lack of creative<br>tension people are so busy being polite<br>to each other they don't argue much<br>anymore it seems whereas the public<br>service I remember was actually a pretty<br>hard school and that had its downsides<br>but you didn't go into a meeting if you<br>hadn't done your homework or if you did<br>you didn't say anything<br>there's been a loss of a kind of<br>skepticism something I loved about the<br>old public sector was there was a bit of<br>a sort of prison camp ethic you all were<br>out trying to persuade politicians to do<br>you what you thought the right thing<br>you'd come back with half marks and get<br>together and have a bit of a session<br>with your with your friends in the<br>department and and say things that you<br>would never say in front of ministers to<br>get it off your chest<br>um and I sort of missed that I wonder if<br>there is this sort of sense there any<br>longer<br>besides the missing or inadequate policy<br>advice that I can see there's a lack of<br>careful institution analysis about how<br>to deliver Services which has been<br>crippling for the present government in<br>my view because there's a natural bias<br>in the central government towards<br>centralization it's in the incentives<br>some people say that's politicization<br>for me as an economist I say well if<br>people are employed by the public sector<br>and they're working for ministers who<br>are ambitious to improve their careers<br>and so on there's a tendency for this<br>whole thing to get bigger and bigger<br>because every solution looks like<br>another opportunity to accrete something<br>which is exactly what you've heard<br>for Martin<br>I think the centralization has gone far<br>too far in education and in the public<br>service as well and is damaging some<br>very successful collaborations and<br>health and the Curious Thing in the the<br>health reform is being done with a a<br>thick rhetoric about empowerment of<br>local people empowering local voice and<br>so on but when you stand back and look<br>at it it's a gigantic Crown entity with<br>something like 82 000 employees probably<br>the biggest sort of organization in that<br>sense in in New Zealand and working with<br>the Capital District Council to try and<br>put together a locality Health Network<br>you find you're talking to somebody on<br>the fourth working for the fourth level<br>of management inside this giant and the<br>answer is don't um don't call us we'll<br>call you we're not ready to talk to you<br>yet so there's a there's a kind of I<br>think non-cognitive dissonance in there<br>about<br>um working with communities supporting<br>people but when it gets to the Practical<br>reality there's still a lot of<br>traditional bureaucratic behavior and<br>you shouldn't expect a big bureaucracy<br>to behave as if it's not so in some ways<br>talking about agile bureaucracies is an<br>oxymoron<br>there's a mistrust of sector specialists<br>in the culture today I don't know how<br>widespread it is but it seems to me that<br>the engineers got kicked out of planning<br>years ago and they should come back when<br>I listened to a really difficult debates<br>about monetary policy today it troubles<br>me that if you want to make a have an<br>opinion on monetary policy which is well<br>founded you'd better have studied<br>monetary Theory at graduate level worked<br>in the area for a few years and maybe<br>done some research<br>it's the same with the regulation of a<br>lot of Industries this isn't for<br>amateurs you've got to be good at this<br>stuff or you make really damaging<br>mistakes so I wonder if there's been a<br>downgrading of of technical skill<br>almost 10 years ago the department of<br>prime minister and cabinet started a<br>framework for training public policy<br>analysts which is world class and is<br>used in other countries and is mentioned<br>in the Public Services Commission report<br>but my sense overall is that it's uh<br>it's lying in the shadow a bit these<br>days it's a brilliant tool it needs to<br>be resuscitated and used much more<br>aggressively than it is secondly on<br>fiscal institutions and what I mean by<br>that are the rules of the game the<br>practices the culture the flows of data<br>the decision rights that sit in the<br>fiscal system not the particular<br>decisions although New Zealand financial<br>reporting system is still the best in<br>the world because it's the most<br>integrated in the world and it's<br>something to be very pleased about but I<br>think there's been a steady erosion of<br>the teeth it once had so we're now at a<br>point where you've got government<br>agencies with multi-category multi-year<br>Appropriations in other words it's a<br>bucket of money money and how you work<br>out what that's been spent on and what<br>you've got for it can be a problem<br>the government largely ignored the<br>requirements and the Public Finance act<br>for fiscal responsibility when covert<br>hit and I can understand that and<br>practical sense God knows it must have<br>been awful being on the treasure at that<br>time but these Clauses were simply<br>ignored and they need to be worked on<br>further to bring them back to a sense of<br>bipartisan agreement and have the<br>parliament taking them seriously which<br>it's not been doing<br>the troubles to me that the long-term<br>fiscal Outlook which Jim Bulger talked<br>about earlier we'd been looking at that<br>demographic fiscal bomb since the<br>mid-90s and we still don't have a<br>coherent and well put together framework<br>for what options you might use to to do<br>something about it<br>I think while the cost-benefit analysis<br>systems in the treasury have been tuned<br>up by the living standards framework<br>I've got to say I'm skeptical of the<br>value of large dashboards covered in<br>well-being indications when I don't know<br>what you do with them to make decisions<br>and a report from Simon Upton<br>parliamentary commissioner for the<br>environment recently is quite blistering<br>in that regard and says MPS can't see<br>any longer what they spent money on and<br>what they got for it and I think it's<br>it's high time to have a good look and<br>see if all of that's producing what you<br>wanted<br>I'm also troubled at Monetary and fiscal<br>policy has got blurred again with the<br>consequence that the Reserve Bank lost<br>nine billion dollars over the covert<br>monetary policy and people of my age<br>remember that the reason we separated in<br>the first place was of course the Robert<br>Muldoon got the Reserve Bank to lose an<br>amount of money which would be several<br>billion today intervening in the foreign<br>exchange markets and so I think that's a<br>mistake that's been made that needs<br>sorting out look there's a lot more to<br>be said about that but that's my second<br>thing let's tune up the fiscal<br>institutions finally on data<br>I don't think the public sector is on<br>the frontiers of data science in areas<br>I'm familiar with and there's a lot of<br>lot that can be done particularly if a<br>social investment comes back in as a<br>government policy there's a lot that can<br>be used there people are obviously aware<br>that the so-called web 3.0 wave of<br>Innovations is hitting all over the<br>world at the moment it'll be 10 years<br>for it to mature but for us to take<br>advantage of this there are four things<br>that have to happen data sovereignty<br>data standards data interoperability and<br>trusted storage now if these<br>developments can take place and we're<br>doing some things with them but if they<br>pushed much harder then I would hope<br>would get an explosion of impact<br>investment doing all sorts of innovative<br>things and social policy Environmental<br>Policy regenerative agriculture and so<br>on which simply can't happen at the<br>moment without free-flowing data running<br>across the system and I think the public<br>sector has to get used to the idea that<br>it won't be in control of all of this it<br>would be a player in it that will no<br>longer run it the IDI will be coming a<br>smaller portion of the total so let me<br>let me leave it there if there's a theme<br>for me it's that we've got too many<br>centralized Solutions and that we lack<br>real skill in the institutional analysis<br>which is very painstaking work to be<br>able to unpack these Delivery Systems<br>and make the best use of modern data<br>however accurate<br>and good afternoon everyone look I've<br>worked in the public sector in both<br>local and central government for more<br>years than I care to remember so that's<br>where I'm going to focus today<br>and my first question on the top comment<br>on my question is<br>have we ever been world class and in my<br>view the answer is no in many respects I<br>think we're probably going backwards<br>uh so I think our public sector is<br>justifiably held in high regard as<br>Martin<br>referred to I am chair of Transparency<br>International and for probity and<br>transparency we are world class<br>uh I do have some doubts about the<br>growing power of the executive but<br>that's another topic for another day<br>but if if if we're talking about making<br>a judgment and our overall standing in<br>the world we have to base that on the<br>results the outcomes that we achieve and<br>I think that there all too often we've<br>we've fall very short of world class<br>the relationship between local<br>government and central government is<br>fraught with conflict and frustration<br>and there's a huge disconnect between<br>governance policy and implementation<br>responsibilities which causes that<br>conflict and endless processes talk<br>about bureaucracy that's where it is at<br>its best<br>public sector has a focus a huge focus<br>on planning which is appropriate it's<br>something we do have to we do need to do<br>but it all seems to Fall to Pieces when<br>it comes to the delivery<br>the source of ongoing frustration is the<br>lack of joined up decision making<br>between government departments and<br>ministers have to take responsibility<br>for that and between our 78 authorities<br>territorial Authority authorities<br>particularly as it refers to<br>infrastructure funding and delivery<br>and the funding is often available lots<br>of it but it sometimes feels like the<br>various Government funding pots<br>available are designed more to apply oil<br>to the squeaky wheel or as has already<br>been referred to announcements by<br>ministers then to ensure sound Urban<br>growth economic growth and prosperity<br>and system-wide infrastructure<br>and the result is that on local<br>government we have parts of funding<br>Stacks required to make any sort of<br>progress but not in the time frame that<br>we need it and with contributions that<br>are contingent on funding agreements<br>from other arms of government and the<br>example of that I would give is<br>wakakotahi who it's a hypothecated fund<br>so it only ever confirmed what it can<br>afford not what is needed it can only<br>commit to funding for three years and<br>yet local government is required to do<br>infrastructure planning and financial<br>planning over 10 years<br>and those two are not even aligned so<br>that when local government comes to do<br>its 10-year plan that knows what the<br>three-year funding commitment from<br>wakakote is how on Earth can you plan<br>infrastructure was that sort of that's<br>where the conflict and the frustration<br>comes however I have to say that in a<br>crisis somehow we managed to pull it all<br>together<br>um and all the crown agencies come to<br>the table with their dollars we get Tang<br>at a fenua sitting at the table often<br>with their dollars and we get local<br>governments sitting there with their<br>dollars and the examples of that<br>um are all too recent so if you look at<br>what happened in Christchurch following<br>the earthquake we got thousands of<br>hectares of land opened up for building<br>and yet you try and do that today you're<br>talking a 10-year process that might end<br>up in the courts<br>we got the crown commissing two major<br>infrastructure building in the CBD in<br>order to give confidence to the private<br>sector to reinvest<br>and then if you look at that magnificent<br>kaikodo to Christchurch Highway that was<br>built following the kaikoura earthquakes<br>built in half the time<br>on budget<br>planned in a tenth of the time that it<br>takes nowadays to get a highway<br>what we have is magnificent that is<br>truly world class we have amenity values<br>for both commute commuters and and for<br>visitors we have<br>a good environmental outcomes and we had<br>monofinoa co-design that is looking at<br>at world-class public service<br>so I'm absolutely positive when we look<br>at uh Cyclone ravaged areas like<br>titafati and Hawke's Bay that the<br>dollars on the table and the clear<br>expectations as to what is what is to be<br>achieved I have no doubt that they'll<br>that that will all work my question is<br>why can't it always be like that because<br>that would certainly be world-class<br>well thank you very much to our<br>panelists for um really getting us to<br>think through these issues and Link them<br>back to a lot of the discussions that<br>have been going on earlier<br>um this morning and the encouragement<br>also to have very Frank conversations I<br>think we should take on on board<br>um if there are questions from the floor<br>please do wave out and we'll get a<br>microphone over to um you otherwise um I<br>think I'm going to make a start on on<br>um<br>or the question you know you all made<br>this comment that where we may be maybe<br>used to be world-class or maybe our<br>world class in some areas but there are<br>certainly other areas where we're far<br>from world class<br>how would we go about getting world<br>class would we look to other countries<br>are there particular other countries<br>that we would look to where would we<br>look to to inform this moving towards<br>it's actually for all of you so you may<br>decide who look in in the areas that I<br>um spoke about<br>it's clear that the outer edges of the<br>dark use of data is in the United States<br>they're so far it I mean the fact that<br>there's all sorts of bad things going on<br>there as well there's also a lot of very<br>good things and I'm I'm presently<br>working for one of the blockchain<br>foundations in the United States I'm<br>just astonished really at the skills<br>that are in the generation of new<br>zealanders who have all these contacts<br>deep into Silicon Valley and so on what<br>they're able to bring here<br>but they're all frustrated that they<br>they can't get things done I mean take<br>something really simple like the<br>anti-money laundering requirements if<br>you're going to launch what they call a<br>digital autonomous organization which<br>muddles up the role of being a<br>shareholder or director or a manager of<br>course our regulatory systems are all<br>based on the idea it's a company with a<br>shareholder and directory or somebody to<br>hold accountable well with a digital<br>autonomous organization that's all a<br>blur and so you know what we're trying<br>to work on is how would you have a<br>regulatory system because these things<br>are Financial products you're asking<br>people to put money in how do you adapt<br>the regulatory system to allow this to<br>happen and I think as I mentioned<br>earlier this could release a huge amount<br>of energy to get this right but where is<br>the energy that's around saying well<br>hang on let's think about how we do<br>regulate these kinds of things so<br>actually getting funded from another<br>I think um<br>we could look<br>very closely at experience of our own<br>communities it's not all offshore<br>but there is stuff offshore I mean<br>um<br>my my son is working in the energy<br>sector in the UK he says that lovely<br>there are things they'd love to do with<br>their energy firm in New Zealand but the<br>regulatory environment simply doesn't<br>permit it and that this wonderful<br>organization here is filled with<br>ambitious people who are making their<br>lives offshore at the moment a lot of<br>people want to come home or might may<br>want to assist in some way<br>um I think part of that is just opening<br>up some of those windows that Rob was<br>talking about before to the private<br>sector and others expatriates or new new<br>migrants I mean you know the great thing<br>about a a liberal and open democracy<br>with open Information Systems is that<br>all voices can be heard you know there's<br>no magic Holy Grail to this thing but<br>you know if you look at world's best<br>practice that any number of four that<br>enable world best practice to be shared<br>but we don't have a methodical system<br>and often in the policy design stage<br>um I know it was different at your time<br>Graham in the in the 80s because it was<br>a real crisis you were well informed<br>about what was going on I'm sure I don't<br>see that as a regular part of the policy<br>process now<br>that people say where is this being done<br>really well uh there's a there's a<br>reluctance I think to be open to that<br>sort of not invented here type of thing<br>I think that's we're quite defensive<br>about it has to be invented here<br>otherwise although you did say we should<br>look in the local communities it's not<br>it's not either or you look at look you<br>look at all of them and you test it and<br>you throw it out there you know and you<br>do it with some speed and alacrity and<br>don't take three or four years you know<br>and so I think I think it's a<br>ministerial level<br>um certainly from a you do look overseas<br>you do look to see where it's being done<br>well and and before covert you'd go and<br>have a look and I'd do that on a number<br>of occasions<br>but you've always got to be careful at<br>what you see in another country is not<br>necessarily be able to be replicated in<br>New Zealand and the classic is probably<br>the most recent one is the three Waters<br>based on what happened in Scotland now<br>there's there's certain advantages in<br>the systems but you've got to put it<br>into the local<br>situation and you've got you've got to<br>put it into the local population you've<br>got you you've you've you've got to make<br>sure it's going to work in New Zealand<br>and that's often where I think we fail<br>is that we try and pick up something<br>from overseas and put it into New<br>Zealand without that different lens on<br>it and I and I agree with Martin within<br>our communities there's enormous<br>resourcefulness and that willingness to<br>do things just to get it done and that's<br>the character of new zealanders isn't it<br>we're the number eight wire type people<br>but we're stifled by regulation<br>um you know we we're just making it so<br>difficult for ourselves<br>uh and and if you talk to anyone on<br>infrastructure at the moment and<br>construction prices are going through<br>the through the roof at sort of 20 to 30<br>percent increases and then when you<br>drive along a road where is Road Works<br>happening we're down to one lane and<br>we're 50 meters away from where a digger<br>might be<br>sometimes I drive hard to find where a<br>person on that Digger is but you know<br>and we don't work 24 hours if you go to<br>Japan and they're putting an<br>infrastructure they're working 24 hours<br>they have to get it done we don't do<br>that it's hugely costly so we just pile<br>regulation and bureaucracy on top of it<br>until it just all takes so long it's so<br>hard and and our Innovative people end<br>up going overseas<br>finding somewhere else where it's a bit<br>easier<br>I'm sorry we need some more solutions<br>can we take a question from the floor<br>please<br>theme earlier today is sort of a spread<br>through all the conversation so far has<br>been about the Central and local<br>government as a provider of service to<br>our community<br>companies businesses social economic<br>organizations and the hurdles that that<br>government sometimes can provide I<br>wanted to just pick up on the thing with<br>data and metrics and outcomes and ask<br>the panel whether you can see parallels<br>from the economic regulation of other<br>Monopoly providers of services in New<br>Zealand whether it's electricity<br>airports Telco and are there any lessons<br>we should take from that which might<br>start to Focus the government agencies<br>on the right outcomes because in my<br>experience there's nothing more powerful<br>than the sunlight of information to<br>cause those who are accountable for<br>those things to change behavior and do<br>I mentioned data um yeah I mean I think<br>if they bring back in some version<br>the some of the techniques that were<br>used in social investment there was a<br>still a Carter of data analysts around<br>the Ministries but they don't seem to<br>have access to leadership positions or<br>decision making but they would be able<br>to do exactly what you're talking about<br>I mean then to just to give you simple<br>examples<br>the analysis has been done that knows<br>what you<br>potentially save by kids who who are<br>taken into this state Care One Way or<br>Another and the condition that they're<br>in at the time they arrive having used<br>historical data and then saying the<br>probability of people who arrive like<br>this<br>having a certain life outcome with<br>obviously a distribution of things<br>around that and not only the cost of<br>that the lives of these people have is<br>simply enormous<br>and we've known that those experiments<br>started in 2005 and I think you had<br>something to do with them<br>but somehow rather that still hasn't<br>become embedded as a core<br>decision-making tool right in the places<br>at ought to be and I think you could<br>bring it all back in about six months<br>frankly<br>and you get into a bit of Politics on<br>that so sorry I'd be picking up on that<br>because because<br>um I tried to do a lot of work with<br>those vulnerable children but but the<br>politics you know why would we call them<br>vulnerable we got rid of the word<br>vulnerable actually they are the most<br>vulnerable in our communities they<br>should be top but they still have to go<br>through all the different Hoops of all<br>the different criteria that all the<br>different government departments have<br>and that's mirrored in infrastructure<br>which you and I were just talking about<br>earlier<br>um that wakakotahi when it is deciding<br>on whether to build a particular road is<br>only looking at the benefits of<br>transport<br>it doesn't take into account what's<br>happening on either side of that<br>transport and whether there's any<br>housing that's released or commercial<br>activity that's released that would<br>account for the value so when we when we<br>come to those individual government<br>departments and you know we tried hard<br>as ministers and I know um there's a<br>there's efforts to try and amalgamate<br>some of that so do you look at things in<br>the hole and<br>all falls short I don't I don't<br>understand why but some maybe it's<br>something in our structure that we all<br>go back into our departments and all of<br>you go back into your departments and<br>the ministers all go back into theirs<br>and get on with that individual piece of<br>work it just seems hard to bring that<br>all together<br>whether it's in social social welfare or<br>whether it's in in infrastructure<br>I think I think just to add in support<br>of that last comment of ends you know we<br>do have a vertical structure between<br>ministers with portfolio<br>responsibilities which are legislated<br>for one of the things I forgot to<br>mention is we are<br>you know quite unusual and being pretty<br>good about operating within the rule of<br>law in New Zealand and that is a really<br>valuable thing<br>um and I remember talking to both of his<br>prime ministers I work closely with the<br>thing you know if any ministers think<br>it's good to Corners you go and have a<br>look at the record of judicial review<br>against ministers decisions and it's the<br>Court's 100 ministers one you know so<br>it's not a path they want to go down<br>um but<br>the collaboration stuff is really hard<br>and it takes time and there's a lot of<br>inertia and sometimes you can sort it<br>out occasionally quite well at officials<br>level and then it gets the cabinet level<br>and it gets unpicked a bit or you know<br>then you've got legislation through the<br>house and there's more unpicking so<br>there are you know<br>there were a lot of voices that are<br>willing to be raised about why things<br>shouldn't be done you know and that's<br>really quite grinding both for ministers<br>and for officials and sometimes you can<br>find yourselves a year later back in the<br>same position so that's really<br>frustrating so you know it needs a bit<br>of a shake-up I mean that's the sort of<br>I'm Kiana I'm Anna woods from the<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and trade<br>um just maybe a comment more than a<br>question but um there was a reference to<br>you know the importance of New Zealand<br>learning from overseas<br>um and just a little bit of a good news<br>story<br>um I ran a couple of streams um in the<br>economic division one of them is policy<br>insights where we task our posts<br>overseas and we work as domestic<br>agencies on policies that they're<br>interested in bringing in a New Zealand<br>or<br>changing so a recent one was we worked<br>with the ministry for the environment on<br>there on New Zealand's nationally<br>determined contribution strategy and<br>they went out to our posts around the<br>network went out and spoke to experts<br>and partner governments who had worked<br>on NDC strategies and learned about what<br>went well<br>um you know what which what were<br>challenges<br>um with the intention of bringing that<br>back to help with New Zealand's strategy<br>that we're working on<br>um another one is the small advanced<br>economies initiative so that's<br>initiative New Zealand leads with fellow<br>small advanced economies of Singapore<br>Switzerland Ireland Denmark Finland<br>Israel and again it's an opportunity for<br>officials to get together learn from<br>each other about what policies have<br>worked which have which haven't to do<br>that really key information sharing and<br>so we're not just tinkering away in the<br>garage in New Zealand we're learning<br>from what has been you know world world<br>class overseas and of course there's our<br>work in the oecd which again is those<br>policy leads getting together and really<br>working on best practice so it is<br>happening<br>well it's nice to have a positive story<br>if you've got any it was more of a<br>comment but if you wanted to respond you<br>may could we have a mic up to this table<br>please<br>um but so picking up on just picking up<br>on them and going back to the previous<br>session on education and we were always<br>I think for the last 20 30 years have<br>been looking at Finland and the<br>education system in Finland who always<br>beat us at the in the in the in the<br>international<br>um results but<br>we know what what is good about the<br>finished system and that is that they<br>train their teachers well extremely well<br>right through to Master's level and then<br>they pay them extremely well and they're<br>highly regarded in their Community I<br>think in New Zealand our teachers are<br>highly regarded but I don't think we<br>train them to that level and of course<br>there's always the the question that<br>Susan raised of how much we paid them so<br>we attract the very best people why<br>would a young scientist go into teaching<br>and earn half the money that they could<br>if they went into industry so you know<br>we we we're always we're all we might<br>know what's best practice and and<br>internationally but we're not always<br>willing to pay the price of that best<br>practice<br>almost to reverse it I actually worked<br>overseas for 20 years as a central<br>Banker both as an act of one and as an<br>advisor throughout most of that period<br>the IMF and most other advisors in the<br>area were using New Zealand as a role<br>model for best practice and not just in<br>targets but in things like governance<br>accountability all those nitty-gritty<br>issues of Central Banking but at the<br>same time as New Zealand was being used<br>as a role model almost everywhere I<br>worked New Zealand was reviewing what<br>they were doing we seemed to lose<br>confidence in our own ability where we<br>were regarded as a world leader by<br>almost everybody else<br>I'll comment on that I<br>um<br>Peter I mean your experience with this<br>has been astonishing really what you've<br>done with your career but I<br>look I see it this way what happened was<br>that because of the crisis in the 80s it<br>called for bold measures they were<br>developed and implemented and like any<br>such thing some of it works better than<br>others you get left with having it left<br>behind a wake of other second round<br>effects that you've triggered off and<br>things were happening in the bit you<br>weren't focusing on while you were<br>concentrating on the crisis so nothing<br>lasts forever there's in a democracy<br>it's always being adjusted now what<br>happened in New Zealand and my viewers<br>instead of<br>the policies that were introduced at<br>that time<br>being comprehensively and intelligently<br>critiqued to the point of saying here is<br>a well-defined better idea to apply to<br>this or that or the other thing what you<br>got was a cacophony of<br>academics who don't publish in March and<br>refereed International journals if you<br>see what I mean<br>uh just with a mantra saying well this<br>is all about outputs we've got to do<br>outcomes as you know bumper stickers<br>like that which have a strong grain of<br>Truth in them but they never said well<br>actually if we did want to do outcomes<br>better how would we do it now the<br>consequence of that<br>is that you've now had 35 years of<br>steady erosion at the margins it's not<br>that you've gone from A system that was<br>designed to deal with a particular<br>situation and now you've got another one<br>so you do it again is just you keep<br>filing the edges off the one that that<br>you inherited and I think that's what's<br>happened which has ended up with you<br>know me and a few others thinking it's<br>time to have another review of our<br>fiscal opportunities and institutions<br>you might not want to go back to those<br>something new in fact I'd argue<br>seriously it should be new but it's got<br>to have teeth<br>and it was kind of lost the teeth it's<br>sorry I thought there was a question at<br>the back<br>um okay let me let me go with one of the<br>online questions that we've got then<br>um that's that's um that's come through<br>and<br>um you know we've got this very sort of<br>big beast I think is a term I heard<br>Martin use at one stage of of different<br>parts of the public sector how do we<br>succeed in optimizing it and getting<br>these different outcomes it's such a big<br>problem now a short answer would be good<br>and I know you're better at finding the<br>identifying their problems and the<br>solutions but I'm going to put you on a<br>spot and ask you what do we do with this<br>big beast Martin how do how do we how do<br>we make progress<br>when we were doing prep for this last<br>week I said that Helen Clark used to say<br>to me several times a year trouble with<br>officials Martin I said the officials<br>are really good at pointing out the<br>problems they're not so good at offering<br>the answers<br>um so I think you've come back to haunt<br>me on that I've come back<br>um you're not a public official well I<br>think optimizing the um the public<br>sector I think is um you know an<br>unattainable Nirvana<br>um to get it all right you know you've<br>got to have<br>good data you know you start from that<br>so good situational awareness then good<br>analysis which requires you know people<br>who are well schooled and trained and<br>got good experience and are going to<br>apply the intellect to to interpreting<br>what they see and then coming up with<br>some options for policy choices then<br>being able to well present them<br>persuasively and get ministers to<br>understand and get in collaboration from<br>other agencies that's really powerful<br>around the cabinet table<br>um and then you've got to go have the<br>right decision made and timeliness is<br>always important<br>um and then of course there's the whole<br>question of implementation<br>um that Anne talked about and then<br>evaluation to see what works so that<br>process is a really long thing<br>um it may be I mean normally quite a<br>number of years before you really see<br>stuff but those elements should appear<br>and everything but the question is where<br>do you apply it because the sector is so<br>enormous I mean I don't think we<br>probably would agree we don't need to<br>have I'm sure they're going to<br>improvements that can be made to the<br>judicial system but<br>upending the the legal system and the<br>courts now is probably not the biggest<br>priority so I think selecting some of<br>the really big elements that are going<br>to have bigger Downstream effects as I<br>mentioned before about the agricultural<br>reforms similarly with the tax reforms<br>really strong bold positions and and the<br>the fiscal and monetary policy settings<br>once those were right lots of other<br>things started to fall into place<br>so I think some some attention to as a<br>step towards optimization which I don't<br>think you could ever achieve is to have<br>a sense about what are the really<br>critical<br>um you know<br>few areas where we need to we need to<br>embark on a journey of refreshing and<br>reinvigorating and as as mentioned<br>earlier today making sure that we're<br>competitive and also I think the<br>attractive to a migrant thing I mean I<br>think that's one of the one of the<br>casualties of uh of the cover thing is<br>that as someone said earlier than where<br>the others are putting the welcome mat<br>up we're putting up a hand of saying No<br>thank you very much that can be<br>devastating uh in the medium and long<br>term and I think there are there are<br>some areas like that which really would<br>would be useful to look at in quite an<br>intense and wide way straight away get a<br>cluster of really big issues that you<br>think are going to make a difference and<br>try and start moving the dial on those<br>you can't do everything at once it's a<br>bit like local government you can't<br>take on the whole of local government<br>once it's a bit tricky but if you do<br>bite-sized chunks you might get some<br>change<br>it's really hard and ask you about this<br>these linkages between the local and<br>central government you know the<br>dysfunctions and how do we how do we<br>improve those dysfunctions that might<br>exist between those different layers I I<br>think the first thing we should do is go<br>to a four-year term for both of them<br>um because that would allow much better<br>analysis and<br>give better time for for implementation<br>and seeing what works so I think that's<br>the first thing three years turnover and<br>you think of the last we've had<br>literally two government two different<br>governments in in the last of the three<br>three years and so you start all over<br>again your public service changes your<br>ministers change and so your policies<br>change<br>um<br>the relationship between it's trying to<br>align uh well first of all there has to<br>be a trust between the two so all too<br>often central government doesn't trust<br>local government to to do the job so<br>they put more rules and regulations on<br>them they also put over to local<br>government the jobs they don't really<br>want to tackle or can't tackle<br>politically and you look at things like<br>local alcohol policies and gambling all<br>of that's been put out to local<br>government<br>in order to get local decision making<br>which is good but they are difficult<br>issues to deal with at the political<br>level but no funding comes with that no<br>support comes with that so all it does<br>is make local government it just affects<br>that relationship between the two and<br>that's really at the core of it is how<br>those two<br>essential parts of our Public Service<br>actually work together understand one<br>another and work to create a good place<br>for people for new zealanders to live in<br>and and a great country and<br>I mean I've you know I've got lots of<br>I've got lots of suggestions but we<br>haven't got time<br>please wave out for a microphone<br>otherwise I'm going to turn to a comment<br>that Rob Fife made this morning and he<br>talked about it was much easier to get<br>decisions through if you've got a small<br>number of people making those decisions<br>and I'm curious about your views on on<br>this we've talked about how we might<br>find Solutions is one solution to move<br>to much smaller groups of people making<br>decisions and what are the implications<br>for democracy when we do these sorts of<br>things so I'm curious about your your<br>views on whether that's a way forward or<br>it's the question of collaboration I<br>mean<br>Jenny Shipley made a very important<br>speech in 1997 when she was minister of<br>State services and she said we've done<br>what we're going to do with all that<br>economy stuff the new agenda of social<br>policy and the rules have got to be<br>different because all of these things<br>interact and you need collaborative<br>processes and ministers sick of hearing<br>public servants arguing with each other<br>in the cabinet and she was right<br>because these social policy problems<br>inherently need Integrated Solutions and<br>they're much harder to get<br>but I've got a thought I'll Express it's<br>a bit risky but I I think collaboration<br>is expensive it leads to<br>interdepartmental committee meetings<br>with you know 30 people at them and if<br>you're lucky and a bit more attention do<br>we need to collaborate about this can't<br>we just say look this is your issue go<br>fix it because if you look at some of<br>the most heroic things that's happened<br>in New Zealand like maybe the management<br>of the second world world war history<br>says it was done by a small hand full of<br>people who actually did a very good job<br>didn't set up a interdepartmental<br>Coordinating Committee to figure out how<br>to prosecute the war so I think a lot<br>more care about where you need to get<br>complex and expensive collaborations and<br>when you can just delegate the job to<br>commissioner with four Commissioners in<br>place from a council of I think it was<br>um and you do you do have to be careful<br>that you are getting a diversity of<br>thought around the table because I mean<br>when I first started in local government<br>in the Napier city council and I think<br>they were 12 councilors and if we all<br>agreed on something<br>um I'd often think have we asked enough<br>questions and this isn't right if you if<br>the community never all agrees on<br>something<br>um so so you do need to make sure that<br>you get a variety of skills and a<br>variety of views around your decision<br>decision-making tables I get really<br>worried when we start saying we need to<br>have diversity and actually we're not<br>talking diversity of schools or thought<br>we're talking diversity about different<br>groups of people whether it's um from<br>different backgrounds from different<br>ethnicities from different genders uh<br>Etc and and the key to decision making<br>is having I think a reasonable number of<br>people well versed in the topic having<br>done their homework<br>and prepared to make a decision because<br>in the end governance requires decisions<br>and all too often both at Central and<br>local levels we see governance that is<br>not prepared to make the hard decisions<br>it is tough to go out it's going to be<br>tough to go out and say to some<br>communities I'm sorry but we're not<br>going to rebuild in that place ever<br>again<br>that's going to be a really tough<br>decision that we're going to have to be<br>saying right across the country<br>sorry but we're not going to allow you<br>to to rebuild or to build in that place<br>because it is not safe<br>um so so you know really strong decision<br>makers have have those skills that I've<br>just outlined what the numbers are I I I<br>don't know I don't think four is enough<br>to run the fifth largest city in in New<br>Zealand I think you do need more than<br>that to get that diversity of thought<br>particularly but I agree I mean I I went<br>to meetings where there would be an army<br>of officials<br>and and set with the with my cabinet<br>colleagues and you were dying to get<br>some really good hard hissing advice I<br>always said I wanted The Good the Bad<br>and the Ugly but you can't win this sort<br>of 40 odd people sitting in a room no<br>one's going to give no one's going to<br>put their head above the water to do it<br>then so too much collaboration is<br>overwhelming and doesn't produce good<br>results but but<br>you do need you do need to be working<br>across some of those portfolios<br>and and working together as a group of<br>ministers and a group of of officials<br>and then I'm with graham then just get<br>on delegate it to someone get on and<br>deliver it and trust them<br>so the right numbers of people the right<br>types of people and that willingness to<br>to make decisions as part of the<br>governance is a strong message it came<br>through and I think that's part of a<br>solution isn't it where we're certainly<br>ending up at the solution Martin any<br>last comment from well I was just<br>thinking of um<br>what Anne was saying there you know I<br>think our cabinet system with the<br>Committees actually works pretty well<br>I've had hundreds of those cabinet<br>committee meetings and there are you<br>know most cabinet committees are 10 or<br>12 people and there's a you know sitting<br>from the foot of the table as I always<br>was there's the PM and the senior<br>ministers who've you know got a bit more<br>gray hair and experienced a few step<br>marks on their back and they and then<br>the ones who are learning the ropes a<br>bit more but when they come together<br>it's very powerful and pretty impressive<br>to see and this the clarity of thinking<br>and the willingness to take a decision<br>and the fact that you don't have<br>hundreds of officials in those rooms or<br>all of the back benches or the whole of<br>the caucus is a really really good thing<br>because and that's I think one of the<br>the enduring benefits of out the way New<br>Zealand prime ministers have always<br>continued to run our cabinet system<br>which is that it's ministers only and<br>long may that last I was advised by some<br>of our Central agency colleagues when a<br>certain government came into power that<br>we should make a strong bid that the<br>head of the prime minister's Department<br>should also sit in the cabinet office in<br>the cabinet meeting and I said I'm not<br>going to do that and I will not propose<br>it and that's it it's a ministerial and<br>political space and they need to have<br>the full Authority and they need to take<br>responsibility for it and they take the<br>advice and stuff so that works well but<br>you know<br>um concentrating the decision making in<br>that sort of way I think is really<br>beneficial and I think ending on that<br>Authority and responsibility is actually<br>quite a nice way to end that the<br>government's on isn't it<br>um we're out of time now we our next<br>panel coming up is infrastructure<br>Housing and Development so Matt will be<br>taking over so you can see there are<br>strong linkages between all of these<br>panels but what a wonderful set of<br>insights we've had from our three<br>speakers today I thank them all very<br>much for their insights and sometimes<br>from a little bit of distance that<br>you've had from the decisions that<br>you're involved with in the past they<br>were able to really bring a wealth of<br>experience and insights to us so thank<br>you very much to all of you</p></main><footer
