you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>curate team uh uh good morning all<br>excellent to see you bright and early I<br>said yesterday that we very rarely get<br>fog in the waikato these days<br>remarkable coincidence uh two in a row<br>um we're really looking forward to<br>today's program and thanks everybody for<br>a stunning day yesterday including uh<br>the dinner for those that could make it<br>so we're about to be joined by the<br>governor of The Reserve Bank Adrian Orr<br>we will then move into the session on<br>governance and populism<br>uh back then on to monetary policy the<br>report card looking at the review of The<br>Last Five Years brief break they keep<br>coming Crown Maori relations<br>sustaining our natural environments and<br>then finish up with our session on China<br>in the west so it's um it's a pretty<br>full program for the morning with the<br>governor in a moment he's going to make<br>some remarks we'll have a small amount<br>of time at the end for questions so as<br>yesterday or for new faces in the room<br>or on the live stream if you're on the<br>computer click the button for slido<br>otherwise there are details on your<br>table and please get questions coming<br>through slido or we'll have a roaming<br>mic on the floor and Adrian please<br>whoa kiorano<br>tattoo<br>um thank you very much for uh for the<br>invitation and to be here and it's<br>wonderful to be surrounded by the bulges<br>again so um a great honor and um and<br>everything I have to say<br>um we can blame them and uh and things<br>should be fine wonderful to be back here<br>also at waikato University<br>um it has sent out some very fine<br>graduates and and me so um it's a<br>beautiful place it's beautiful to be<br>back here as well uh before I start I<br>also just want to note we've got a<br>couple of members from tiputia matua The<br>Reserve Bank in the audience with you as<br>well James Sergeant<br>um uh sitting over here and and Paul<br>Conway Paul will be up later on and I<br>note that because I'm very keen that um<br>you do get to chat with the bank<br>um we're open we want to collaborate<br>we're ready for business and so we are<br>here<br>uh I'd be wrong not to start the address<br>by acknowledging the extreme hardship<br>that many new zealanders in the upper<br>North Island are going through at the<br>moment<br>um Our Hearts and Thoughts uh with them<br>and it is a significant challenge we<br>have ahead<br>um for the short term and I'm really<br>pleased with the agenda Matt that<br>sustainability and and adaptation is all<br>part of the kurora as well over time so<br>we have really big issues<br>today my topic is around about how our<br>work at The Reserve Bank tiputia matua<br>can best contribute to economic<br>well-being and prosperity I'm going to<br>be reasonably formal because there's a<br>written speech that goes on record for<br>those who didn't understand my mumbling<br>you can go and read later very good<br>sleep therapy and it's all there<br>uh<br>in terms of contributing to our economic<br>well-being and prosperity<br>um that is our purpose our reason on<br>debt our reason for being and uh it is<br>uh the key opening line of our new<br>legislation that I'll talk you through<br>uh I'll chat through about our<br>legislation our policy remits and how<br>these commitments shape uh the very<br>broad work we manage at tiputi MR2 and<br>in particular the trade-offs that we<br>inevitably face from time to time so<br>it's going to be a lot about optimizing<br>subject too<br>throughout the speech uh I won't say as<br>you know because I'm not sure people do<br>know that we have actually three strands<br>main strands of work at the Central Bank<br>the first one of course is monetary<br>policy we are the proud Monopoly<br>supplier of the fiat currency the New<br>Zealand dollar and with that monetary<br>policy we aim to keep Consumer Price<br>inflation low and stable Through Time<br>it's our desire that the purchasing<br>power of our currency is strong and that<br>you know that the dollar meets the three<br>kind of criteria of a currency that it<br>is seen as a unit of account<br>a means of exchange and a store of value<br>otherwise it's not a currency<br>of course we are humble very humble in<br>our ability to achieve stable Consumer<br>Price inflation all of the time our<br>tools are suitably limited and they're<br>very long and uncertain lags between<br>what we do with interest rates and the<br>inflation outcomes that are achieved<br>meanwhile economic shocks are just that<br>for example in my time as governor and<br>every Governor has their own list the<br>shocks we've gone through we've endured<br>the covid-19 global meltdown uh the<br>impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine<br>and now of course the events impacting<br>the North Island through these severe<br>weather events these events by the way<br>are historically significant the<br>movements and output inflation<br>employment are historically significant<br>as we've gone through this period<br>we don't determine the context the<br>economic context we operate in instead<br>we're left to react to that context with<br>those long legs and we react with a very<br>clear purpose that we State strongly and<br>often which is aiming for Price<br>stability<br>and our role is to continue to build on<br>a reputation for delivering low and<br>stable inflation expectations<br>always for looking always thinking about<br>the context and reacting that that path<br>is well beaten the second strand of our<br>work of course is promoting Financial<br>stability<br>we aim to both lower the probability and<br>the impact of financial institutions and<br>insurers getting into trouble or failing<br>it's critical for a modern economy that<br>these institutions are able to<br>continuously Supply the services to<br>people they are built on trust and<br>critical to an economy<br>and then the third main strand of our<br>work is delivering all of the other<br>functions the Central Bank delivers<br>ensuring the supply of cash throughout<br>the economy<br>transactionally banking the banks<br>themselves and using overseeing and<br>operating all of the critical payment<br>and settlement systems so those latitude<br>roles are often overlooked because of<br>the excitement of the headlines of what<br>have we done with the official cash rate<br>and delivering on these three strands of<br>work there is a lot of balancing and<br>trade-offs that we must always Undertake<br>and acknowledge<br>so there's plenty of judgment there's a<br>wide range of knowledge and inputs that<br>we look and seek for there's a lot of<br>conventional economic tools we have and<br>then of course we have our financial<br>capital and our people around the tools<br>and Frameworks to try to succeed through<br>all of this we aim to be transparent<br>and understood by the broad public so we<br>spend a lot of time around transparency<br>and that people can see what we're doing<br>and how we came to these decisions<br>looking ahead for us our big challenges<br>we want to shift you know and like<br>everyone does in the Jim Collins World<br>from good to great for us to be<br>exceptional what we're doing at the bank<br>is looking and working holistically<br>across all three aspects of that bank to<br>glean the best data the best insights<br>and to best be able to manage the<br>trade-offs which I'll talk about as we<br>can so I was thinking about it you know<br>in the in the world of algorithms when<br>Central Bankers are replaced by an<br>algorithm uh what are we trying to do<br>well we're trying to maximize several<br>objectives<br>um subject to taking no undue<br>operational Legal Financial reputation<br>risk I say no undue there is risk to<br>everything we take you need to have a<br>risk to get a reward but it's the undue<br>risk we try to avoid Through Time<br>so some of the examples around you know<br>that maximizing subject two uh very to<br>bring it tangible<br>we're asked to pursue low and stable<br>inflation and contribute to maximum<br>sustainable employment<br>but doing that without creating undue<br>volatility and output interest rates in<br>the exchange rate<br>so embedded in that simple statement is<br>already two significant balancing acts<br>we need to take we're asked to maximize<br>Financial system soundness<br>while also supporting efficiency<br>competition Innovation and financial<br>inclusion<br>we're asked to promote certainty of cash<br>availability while also promoting<br>Technology Innovation in payments and<br>settlement systems<br>we're asked to ensure we have robust<br>payment and settlement systems while<br>encouraging competition and innovation<br>and we're being asked to be the<br>liquidity provider you know in an<br>extreme financial event while also<br>trying to minimize moral hazard and<br>Market behavior and of course be prudent<br>with our own balance sheet so you can<br>see through those basic things there is<br>no one objective function there are many<br>and all of them come with subject two<br>subject to subject two so our task is<br>always to build a consistent coherent<br>transparent framework that we can<br>explain to the public our customers what<br>we're doing and why we're doing it<br>across all aspects of our work we need<br>to know what the objectives are what the<br>trade-offs are and what our risk<br>appetite is to achieving these<br>uh I'll put it now into what is our new<br>legislation and I think it's really<br>important that people do have a look<br>this is your back tiputia martyr our<br>Central Bank<br>um so in terms of the hierarchy of<br>objectives that we have<br>um which forms you know the basis of the<br>trade-offs and the criteria that we use<br>in our business at the top of that<br>pyramid who's the Reserve Bank act it's<br>given the authority to carry out the<br>tasks I just mentioned through new<br>legislation there's a new Reserve Bank<br>act 2021 that came in in to action mid<br>last year and it replaced the 1989 to 30<br>year old act a lot of the stuff is the<br>same but there are important nuances and<br>differences uh this foundational<br>legislation is um is very clear you know<br>our purpose is to promote prosperity and<br>well-being of all new zealanders and<br>contribute to a sustainable and<br>productive economy that is the opening<br>Preamble and its explicit recognition<br>that you know the activities we take<br>undertake as a central bank are a means<br>to an end they're not the end in<br>themselves and so we always have to have<br>that connectedness back to society<br>around promoting a sustainable and<br>productive economy underneath the<br>legislation sits our remits these are<br>negotiated and agreed and signed by the<br>Minister of Finance the agreements and<br>while we have statutory independence<br>from the government the remit documents<br>explicitly outline what the government<br>of the day wishes us to take in into<br>account when undertaking our our three<br>main tasks we've got a new one a<br>financial policy remit and it states in<br>pursuing Financial stability the<br>government seeks strong institutions<br>that we have to act with proportionate<br>regulation<br>they want consistency of treatment<br>across our across our regulated<br>institutions maintain competition and<br>have consideration for efficiency<br>inclusion Innovation and amongst all<br>that have a low incidence of failure of<br>institutions<br>so we've got the legislation then we've<br>got this remit the monetary policy<br>agreement the one that has been around<br>for a long time now outlines the<br>government's desire for medium-term<br>Price stability and maximum sustainable<br>employment<br>but also ensuring soundness of the<br>financial system and avoiding<br>unnecessary instability and output<br>interest rates in the exchange rate<br>so<br>a clear objective function but lots of<br>secondary criteria that we need to have<br>regard to and be able to explain back to<br>the people how we are doing it<br>so the remits and the legislation are<br>our guiding North Star they give us a<br>very clear direction of where we have to<br>go but they don't tell us how to get<br>there that is left back inside tiputia<br>mature and with Ward there's one other<br>stage actually we also receive annually<br>a letter of expectations and again these<br>are public they're on our website and<br>it's another way of the government of<br>the day guiding what would be in our<br>statement of intent you know our five<br>year ahead and what they expect to see<br>us being measured against our statement<br>of performance<br>so we've got legislation we've got<br>remits and we've got letters of<br>expectations all of that comes together<br>in a hierarchical structure<br>with plenty and plenty of guidance but<br>what is critical to understand is<br>there's no single first best optimal<br>calibration of it all instead we are<br>optimizing various outcomes over various<br>time Horizons subject to managing other<br>specific risks related to that Legal<br>Financial reputation operational aspects<br>of our work<br>and so the algorithm has started to look<br>quite complex isn't it I'm not sure it's<br>even one algorithm we're maximizing our<br>aims subject to note and due risk I'll<br>bring it into real-time issues now I'll<br>start with monetary policy you know the<br>best example of a trade-off in action<br>here is where we're required to keep<br>inflation within a Target band and<br>support maximum sustainable employment<br>while also having regard for these other<br>factors the efficiency soundness<br>unnecessary and stability and<br>discounting transitory events looking<br>through for example at the moment the<br>obvious one is severe weather condition<br>near 10 price spikes how do we look<br>through that and focus on generalized<br>inflation rather than jumping to<br>relative price concerns<br>the first part of the trade-off relates<br>to this dual Mandate of low and stable<br>inflation and maximum sustainable<br>employment<br>uh mostly there is no trade-off when<br>inflation is high employment is strong<br>unemployment is low as it is now across<br>all those three variables<br>um it all points to raising interest<br>rates in an effort to slow domestic<br>spending to better match the supply<br>capacity of the economy so that's all<br>straightforward but of course there can<br>and will be trade-offs in the future if<br>we're faced with for example stagflation<br>I don't met in the audience here are<br>fortunately like myself old enough to<br>remember what that felt like where you<br>have a period of low growth you have<br>Rising unemployment but still high<br>inflation then what do we do do we raise<br>interest rates to slow inflation or do<br>we lower interest rates to to try to<br>maximize employment<br>so that's where these trade-offs begin<br>to bite I want to calm the audience<br>because it's without doubt across<br>Central Banking knowledge history<br>economic understanding that a Central<br>Bank in that situation has to be<br>Resolute to bring inflation down<br>and we need to bring inflation back to a<br>target range but of course we need to do<br>it over a reasonable Horizon<br>um so as not to unnecessarily crash the<br>economy and turn temporary slower growth<br>and do permanent unemployment so it's a<br>horizon challenge the second part of the<br>trade-off of course is how far and how<br>fast do we Reign inflation in without<br>creating that worse outcome overall<br>here we need to have regard to these<br>other issues around Financial stability<br>and unnecessary volatility<br>and that's where the balancing act gets<br>really hot<br>I do recall um I think it was Mervin<br>King who started a few next move with<br>the interest rate is really difficult to<br>to make it means you're probably in a<br>good position at the moment if your next<br>move is really obvious you're in the<br>wrong position<br>so I left in the official cash rate too<br>fast or too far can for example lead to<br>a severe downturn uh spending and<br>investment collapses and you end up with<br>a much higher exchange rate because<br>foreign exchange dealers chase the<br>higher yielding in the New Zealand<br>dollar and you crash the export sector<br>and all economies have been through that<br>before so there's that Balancing Act<br>between inflation expectations being<br>controlled but not going crazy and<br>crashing the economy<br>in the financial stability place we're<br>faced with very similar trade-offs our<br>remit says that the government wants a<br>financial system that is strong<br>efficient and inclusive as we know if<br>you want to make a bank strong you limit<br>the amount of risk taking they can have<br>undertake however by doing that of<br>course you undermine then the efficiency<br>of the financial system itself<br>um you know modern Banks and regulator I<br>say modern in the last 200 years realize<br>that lending out deposits is a<br>manageable risk likewise borrowing short<br>term for The Banks deposit rates and<br>lending longer terms is also a<br>manageable risk but we have to accept<br>that risk and we have to be able to<br>manage that risk and accept that this is<br>not a zero failure situation you know a<br>very specific example and one that<br>caused a lot of um challenge when it was<br>being implemented I wasn't Governor at<br>the time is the imposition of loan to<br>value<br>restrictions this limits the amount of<br>high risk low Equity loans that you can<br>make to um to their customers we don't<br>want too many people of course borrowing<br>with no equity to back it up because any<br>sudden drop in value suddenly puts<br>households in stress and if it's<br>widespread it puts the banking system<br>under danger and we can see that having<br>some kind of constraint on on loan to<br>value restrictions makes Financial<br>stability sense<br>but of course it can also significantly<br>impose inefficiency across the system if<br>you take anything too far you know a<br>first home buyer may not have the<br>hundred thousand dollars they need for a<br>deposit but they may have a steady job a<br>good salary good future income prospects<br>growing income and so they could easily<br>honor a mortgage commitment for them<br>borrowing would be restrictive if they<br>can't you know if you had that<br>restriction on the loan to value ratio<br>and so this is why<br>an example of our risk appetite at the<br>bank is we allow Banks to have some high<br>lvr lending and it's for banks to work<br>out who are the recipients of those High<br>lvr loans it's not at a zero position<br>um you know there's plenty of analogies<br>around speed limits on cars and so on<br>and so forth you know this is the lvr<br>situation uh banks are allowed to make<br>some of their loans but not all of their<br>loans<br>um is high risk activity Financial<br>inclusion<br>um this is a really interesting topic<br>and one that um is front and center for<br>us and our financial policy remit we all<br>know that Financial inclusion is a key<br>import or key component of economic<br>well-being it's also specifically<br>reference as I said in in our financial<br>policy remit and letters of expectations<br>we have to have regard to it we are<br>actively playing a bigger part of our<br>role in financial inclusion it's<br>involving a lot of analysis<br>and work across places that we haven't<br>been too often to better ensure people<br>can access the financial system and<br>endure its benefits a lack of financial<br>inclusion is not good it leads to poor<br>availability and accessible safe<br>Financial Services<br>it restricts access to banking Insurance<br>all of the things that we believe are<br>critical for a modern economy and it<br>leads to many societal problems<br>um if you were forced to go to payday<br>loans with high interest rates and all<br>sorts of uh<br>heinous activities then you have<br>significant societal issues so we are<br>working with the finance sector and<br>other stakeholders to develop our<br>understanding of what what is meant by<br>Financial inclusion and really holding a<br>mirror up to ourselves around what are<br>our actions doing to increase or<br>decrease Financial inclusion<br>and our longer term aim is it just<br>becomes part of our DNA on the way<br>through<br>for example I would say you know it's<br>Financial inclusion is really obvious<br>for some parts of our work and less<br>obvious the links are harder I think<br>about access to cash Financial inclusion<br>is very critical to call considerations<br>around that whereas the link between<br>Financial inclusion and financial<br>stability uh more distant and we have to<br>think harder around you know you could<br>make an incredibly sound financial<br>system by excluding everyone and making<br>no loans but would that would that be<br>inclusive<br>uh so many examples across our<br>activities that we need to articulate as<br>particularly around our appetite for<br>actively addressing barriers to<br>inclusion and defining what the<br>trade-offs are currently in front of us<br>we've got significant work around our<br>new deposit takers legislation this has<br>been going through the house it'll soon<br>be an act and in that we have to assess<br>how we will use and operate that<br>legislation supervising all the deposit<br>takers and the choices we need to make<br>on on regulatory proportionality<br>by that we mean you can't have the one<br>rule for all because you would end up<br>excluding an enormous amount of<br>efficiency and Innovation going on<br>uh we're also thinking around Financial<br>inclusion with our new role around<br>stewarding within the Cash System<br>producing storing Distributing cash to<br>the public and we have to do that with a<br>wide range of participants the banks the<br>cash and Transit companies<br>a whole host of folk going on and<br>inclusion is one of the key principles<br>we're thinking about in our work at the<br>moment considering a central bank<br>digital currency<br>um so you can see inclusion is important<br>I'll bring it home<br>some communities for example rely very<br>heavily on cash and more heavily than<br>other people<br>um in their daily life but ensuring wide<br>access to cash and it's making sure it<br>is accepted in its use is very expensive<br>for banks businesses and customers<br>so how do you get that Financial<br>inclusion going at the expense of<br>alternative means of transaction there<br>is a trade-off<br>we are juggling that efficiency versus<br>inclusion I do have to say that you know<br>the recent severe weather events<br>throughout the North Island reminded us<br>again that when the power's off when you<br>have no telecommunications physical cash<br>becomes king once again and then the<br>absence of a means of exchange a trusted<br>means of exchange when it's suddenly<br>gone leads to almost immediate social<br>cohesion challenge<br>we've seen that globally and we've been<br>observing that in recent days here in<br>artery New Zealand we also want to make<br>a payment system that encourages and<br>enables Innovation this may be a central<br>bank digital currency we're working<br>through on that<br>um loved the idea because it Fosters<br>Innovation it can reduce costs and<br>banking it enables faster and more<br>secure payments and it encourages<br>greater competition all these beautiful<br>things but by doing so you're exposing<br>yourself to new risks operational risks<br>reputational risks because you've got<br>more and more Reliance on certain pinch<br>points around technology so again The<br>Innovation versus the inclusion versus<br>efficiency and soundness are all<br>balancing Acts<br>what are the criteria for doing all this<br>well um our board our newly empowered<br>board I'm very proud of it by the way<br>the chair of the board of course is also<br>the vice Chancellor of waikato<br>University<br>Professor Neil Quigley they now have uh<br>an appropriately empowered board as<br>opposed to an overseeing board they have<br>to own<br>the risk appetite and make the risk<br>appetite very clear to the public of New<br>Zealand and how they are going to accept<br>risks and manage the trade-offs uh they<br>have to understand what the economic<br>underpinnings are of all of our<br>activities and when we're standing on<br>what I would say<br>facts versus<br>well-held beliefs<br>beliefs around how economies work<br>um all the different economic models and<br>Frameworks what are those underpinnings<br>and how is that research giving us<br>confidence that those beliefs hold true<br>so we're working with the board around<br>Clarity of our objectives<br>the understanding of the hierarchy<br>involved across our legislation our<br>remits and all of these other<br>expectations are articulating our risk<br>appetite statements and and what it<br>means and implies across their<br>activities creating awareness of what<br>facts we stand on when we make decisions<br>but also building trust in the beliefs<br>that we hold in undertaking our business<br>and in those beliefs this is where you<br>know I look to the audience and<br>Incredibly well educated audience this<br>is where we need help continuously<br>around the research and the challenging<br>and testing around what is the academic<br>or empirical evidence around the beliefs<br>of the work we're doing<br>it's only then when the board you know<br>when the board has Clarity and<br>objectives hierarchies the risks uh<br>facts and beliefs it's only then a board<br>can sit back and say<br>um we have confidence in the activities<br>that we are doing and we are able to<br>assess the resources we need financial<br>and human resources people we need to<br>undertake the activities and we know<br>when we are being prudent with our<br>balance sheet so it's a wonderful<br>holistic opportunity that's coming<br>together through this legislation to<br>make all of this happen<br>of course<br>um all of these capabilities and<br>capacities will have to change through<br>time and again they change driven by<br>factors outside of our control<br>technology demographics societal<br>expectations are changing continuously<br>and that will change the types of<br>capabilities capacities Financial<br>Resources we need Central Banking is not<br>static it is dynamic<br>um of course bringing us all of this<br>together at the shop underpinning any<br>institution are our values and our<br>culture and we've been spending an<br>enormous amount of work on identifying<br>the values we need and the culture that<br>will work for us that we can operate<br>holistically as a central bank across<br>these groups this is why we introduced<br>the TR Maori framework into our<br>discussions and our work it's arturoa<br>homegrown it's a link between Prosperity<br>inclusion sustainability cohesion why<br>wouldn't you adopt a framework that is<br>ready and understood to be able to<br>explain what we're doing and work as a<br>holistic single unit<br>building our cultural capability also<br>recognizes the unique position of course<br>of rtro in New Zealand of tangada fenua<br>and the role of titurity or waitangi so<br>you know these are uh both uh necessary<br>and and a critical part of the culture<br>and values and role that we play and<br>particularly helping us shift from that<br>good to great in in that Central Banking<br>uh building the cultural capability has<br>also provided some pretty amazing and<br>critical insights around an important<br>growing component of the rtro economy<br>Maori economic activity the Renaissance<br>of Maori business and some of the unique<br>ownership structures and and<br>decision-making structures that go there<br>I have to say our recent work looking to<br>improve access to capital for Maori<br>business has been eye-opening<br>um surprisingly too much eye-opening<br>poor financial institutions in New<br>Zealand we have to try harder we need to<br>serve the people of Arturo and New<br>Zealand better and so that is some of<br>the Mahi that we're involved in we're<br>also growing our climate risk expertise<br>and again and this is about<br>understanding the challenges and risks<br>to the economy and the financial system<br>the risks to the central bank and our<br>role and the role of the financial<br>system in mitigation edit and adaptation<br>going forward the Reserve Bank act makes<br>it clear we have to have this wider<br>regard and we would be foolish in any<br>economic sense not to have regard to<br>this work<br>uh so looking ahead and just you know<br>kind of in conclusion and this is the<br>Widow that I'll put on the table this is<br>where we need help to collaborate and<br>work together with the wisdom that is<br>New Zealand's academic great<br>um many of whom are in this room and I<br>hope some who are online<br>we have a long tradition of pursuing<br>policy relevant research<br>we are a full service Central Bank so<br>not all of our researchers around<br>monetary policy it is across all of the<br>aspects we just talked about the three<br>strands our recent review and I see it's<br>a topic du jour in an hour or so our the<br>review and assessment of the formulation<br>and impropation of monetary policy<br>not hell of a mouthful we didn't come up<br>with that title um you know the recent<br>review has highlighted some really<br>critical lessons from the last five<br>years<br>at the moment we have research going on<br>around Supply driven shocks to inflation<br>demand-driven shocks to inflation and<br>climate related risks to inflation so<br>all of this work is going on and Paul<br>Conway is there I'm sure he'll touch on<br>bits of it later on this morning uh our<br>research work on financial stability is<br>also extensive I've already talked about<br>how we're going to be proportioning our<br>activity around the deposit takers act<br>but we're also working on what is an<br>optimal deposit compensation scheme look<br>like with you know we are now entering<br>the world of the hundred thousand dollar<br>maximum payout if a bank fails on on<br>your deposit so on so forth implementing<br>that working on developing and<br>understanding the macro Prudential tools<br>we have I've talked about the loan to<br>value ratio but we look at deposit to<br>income restrictions how do they<br>intersect with our normal Prudential<br>tools capital and liquidity and what is<br>the optimal calibration of these tools<br>together through a Financial cycle so it<br>is complex work and remember we're<br>balancing soundness efficiency and<br>inclusion<br>so we have to be optimizing across a lot<br>of activity our future of money program<br>which is well established now has seen<br>us engage very very broadly across New<br>Zealand and internationally and that's<br>better to better understand our money<br>and payments needs across the country<br>I've talked about the cash but what<br>about a central bank digital currency<br>how does that fit around inclusion<br>efficiency Innovation<br>so you know these are really really<br>important topics that we need your help<br>to understand and I've continued we're<br>continuing to work around improving<br>access to capital for small to<br>medium-sized Enterprises and for the<br>Maori economy that's really important<br>Mahi and I believe it will be a big part<br>of unlocking the potential of RTR a<br>broad range of climate change research<br>is going on and we're hanging with the<br>best in New Zealand we're relying on the<br>science from from the experts in this<br>field but we're bringing it into our Roy<br>and about how does it impact on<br>financial stability what are the roles<br>for the banks and insurers around<br>adaptation mitigation and how can we<br>provide stress tests quite morbidly last<br>year it was in the last year we ran<br>stress tests for the banks where we had<br>three floods back to back in Auckland<br>and to see what that would do for the<br>banking system unfortunately it turned<br>out to be quite fortuitous but it's all<br>about raising awareness capability<br>capacity within the banking system and<br>insurance activity to manage this stuff<br>and internationally we're engaged with<br>the network for Greening the financial<br>system a Global Network I think it's<br>well 120 plus central banks another<br>financial institutions we're leading one<br>of the work streams around Central Bank<br>Net Zero we're leading that with the<br>bank of Italy and that's around<br>sustainable investment greeting our own<br>operations but most importantly<br>developing climate related disclosures<br>from financial institutions<br>so in summary I think you might have<br>gleaned at the world of Central Banking<br>comes with many many trade-offs to be<br>made and they're much Uncharted water<br>left out there that we have to get<br>through and I can't emphasize enough<br>that we are a learning institution we<br>seek input we want to collaborate and<br>you know that's the word or that I put<br>on please come and work alongside us we<br>need to be doing this on many topics as<br>per the conversations we've had<br>um I think probably the nicest<br>if you want to Pedal fast paddle alone<br>if you want to paddle far<br>paddle together<br>thank you very much<br>yeah as long as the audience can suffer<br>them all right<br>um that'll make quite a few questions<br>have come through and we won't go too<br>long but first thank you really<br>um fascinating oversight for many of us<br>who you're quite right we see the<br>announcements on the on the cash rate we<br>sometimes don't see the other parts of<br>the operations of the bank so some of<br>the questions that were coming through<br>picked up on your theme about the<br>trade-offs uh the the complexity of<br>managing those tensions<br>and one was given those trade-offs that<br>are inherently already there<br>can you provide some clarity on the Dual<br>mandate<br>the current mandate<br>given the question sees the the poor<br>experience of other central banks<br>pursuing this policy and I guess I'll<br>extend that<br>given so many other trade-offs inherent<br>is it simpler to actually have the<br>single mandate<br>uh<br>no I think you know a single mandate has<br>the trade-offs that are expressed anyway<br>in the Dual mandate the history the<br>short history of New Zealand inflation<br>targeting was that we've always had to<br>have regard to avoiding unnecessary<br>instability and output interest rates<br>and the exchange rate and we've always<br>had to have regard to Where Do We<br>Believe employment is relative to its<br>maximum sustainable level that is called<br>potential output that is the potential<br>growth rate of an economy and through<br>that output Gap type framework it's<br>always there so whether you make it<br>explicit in the PTA or implicit that's<br>really a political decision in reality<br>it's there<br>thank you<br>I'll stay then on some of the trade-offs<br>we'll have a longer discussion with Paul<br>and others on the The Five-Year review<br>shortly one question that comes up is<br>obviously you identified quite a few<br>learnings in there Supply shocks and and<br>so on<br>given the increase in asset prices and<br>perhaps the unexpectedly small impact on<br>employment and jobs<br>was the discussion of why wasn't there a<br>conclusion about there may have been too<br>much stimulus in the earlier parts of<br>the pandemic yeah I would just invite<br>and Paul can go on that I would invite<br>people to actually go and read the<br>document<br>um because generally I get comments from<br>people who haven't actually read our<br>document and in that document we talk<br>about uh monetary policy whether the<br>impacts were different than anticipated<br>the answer is no the biggest surprise<br>was the continuous series of shocks All<br>in One Direction<br>from from covert from Ukraine and now<br>more recently from the severe events so<br>it's not monetary policy remains focused<br>over the medium term around price<br>stability but when you're getting hit<br>with continuous shocks um welcome to the<br>world the real world we live in so and<br>then within that document we say what<br>are some of the lessons yes at the<br>margin we could have started tightening<br>sooner but even there within the<br>documents and we show even then rather<br>than the seven percent inflation it<br>would have been six point something so<br>again even tightening sooner didn't<br>really change the fact that we're well<br>outside of the inflation Target as is<br>every other over City Country because of<br>the nature of the economic shocks<br>um thank you can I um<br>there's a question here on composition<br>of monetary policy committee and I might<br>come to that in a moment<br>when you run us through that list of of<br>trade-offs that you're facing at an<br>operational level can you give us a<br>window into the Frameworks you and the<br>team use<br>to actually go through that number of<br>you know legislative remits other things<br>letters of expectation how do you an<br>operational level week-to-week<br>day-to-day run through those trade-offs<br>and analyze the impacts yeah I'll try<br>I'll try and start very<br>um simply the first thing of course is<br>uh not all committees are involved on<br>all the one topics you know so we have<br>dedicated efforts to around Financial<br>stability committee the monetary policy<br>committee the payment and and Care<br>settlement committees so very dedicated<br>Resources with their own with their own<br>objective functions<br>um with Clarity around the criteria they<br>must try and maximize those objective<br>functions around I'm sorry sounding so<br>Bland and increasingly a more explicit<br>awareness of the risks they have to<br>actively seek to achieve those outcomes<br>so once you've got that very clear it<br>doesn't become as complex as it sounds<br>if you aren't if you don't have those<br>clear then how do you know you're<br>optimizing and how can you truly explain<br>to the public what you're actually doing<br>and how do you know if you've got the<br>optimal resources the appropriate skills<br>the balance sheet Etc to achieve those<br>outcomes so that is the clarity that we<br>need in the Central Banking world that<br>Clarity has been long held in modern<br>times at least for monetary policy the<br>monetary policy committee the<br>projections The Horizon all of those<br>tools and things that people are used to<br>financial stability has been more<br>complex it's a far more supportive you<br>know it's a very heterogeneous topic<br>there's many different facets to it and<br>so bringing that under one type of<br>umbrella is a real important challenge<br>for the bank ongoing it's been a poor<br>cousin Prudential regulation it's now<br>holistically being thought about around<br>Financial sides and you know cash and<br>payment assailment systems I would say<br>at The Reserve Bank that was seen as the<br>folk that just shift trolleys around<br>down in the basement and um and do<br>physical cash<br>yet it's at the core of our Essence it's<br>the sap in in what we're doing so again<br>bringing that into that holistic picture<br>around a means of Exchange<br>how is that going to be able to enhance<br>societal Behavior okay that's a sorry<br>waffling but no it's a great one to go<br>into and I think um<br>uh next year we're looking at launching<br>a uh Bachelor of financial technology<br>fintech here at the University and at<br>the management school because it's such<br>a critical topic ranging from back<br>office Clearinghouse functions right<br>through to central bank digital<br>currencies the cbdc can you explain to<br>us a great illustration there when the<br>system goes down when the fbos doesn't<br>work when you need suppliers it's a<br>flooding situation this is just<br>happening last week can you talk to us<br>though what what might a central bank<br>digital currency look like I think for<br>some of us it's hard to actually<br>understand what that means we can<br>already pay with our phones what's what<br>would be different so I I just um start<br>on that first but resilience you know as<br>wood du jour around the world and<br>certainly here in Arturo and New Zealand<br>at the moment resilience was around<br>Supply chains falling apart during<br>covert uh resilience now is about about<br>um uh almost all activities in New<br>Zealand from the Cook Strait Ferry<br>through to getting cash out of an ATM we<br>are so thinly spread uh it's all just in<br>time there's no just in case mentality<br>going on in in corporate society and so<br>we need to build up that resilience we<br>need to have uh in the simple cash<br>management side yes you may not use it<br>day to day and all the time but when you<br>need it it has to be available and<br>immediately so so what are we doing<br>around increasing that resilience the<br>availability of cash the ability to<br>store cash across regions so and so<br>forth that is critical and a central<br>bank digital currency is not going to<br>remove the need for that resilience you<br>are going to have to be able to operate<br>without power without Communications and<br>without the law of the gun deciding who<br>gets the loaf of bread so so you know<br>that that is critical a central bank<br>digital currency meanwhile is simply an<br>electronic signal that sits in the<br>central bank that says uh IOU something<br>so it's no different to an electric<br>signal that sits in a retail bank except<br>this time it's with the central bank and<br>because it's with the central bank it's<br>narrow money it is the true fiat<br>currency rather than broader money money<br>created by the retail Banks themselves<br>you know through fractional banking so<br>it is a true it's the equivalent of<br>having a physical one dollar a physical<br>note you've got an electronic signal<br>with the same Insider high-powered<br>one-to-one relationship if you all we<br>all know this and I don't want to create<br>a sudden rush for the door if you're<br>just realizing it that if we all went to<br>try and take all of our deposits out<br>right now the banks wouldn't have it you<br>know they they lend out far more than<br>they physically Halt and that is that's<br>um<br>fractional banking but with the<br>one-to-one Central Bank digital currency<br>it's there it's backed by the crown the<br>crown balance sheet current and all<br>future taxpayers so that so that's the<br>idea<br>we're who holds it<br>um uh electronic signal is the really<br>critical part<br>does a central bank holder and Bank<br>everyone transactionally or does the<br>Central Bank allow retail Banks to hold<br>that electric signal and customers have<br>a choice between uh Bank a money or<br>Central Bank money on their accounts how<br>do they split those two so that is where<br>it gets important because the central<br>bank is not the risk allocator of<br>capital around that that is done it's a<br>very important role of banks to allocate<br>that capital on a you know on a<br>risk-based manner so so that's so it's<br>so simple at the heart what makes it<br>different to a Bitcoin or to a um a<br>stable coin well it's the central banks<br>money it's not someone else's IOU or I<br>promise it's not Zuckerberg's promise or<br>around you'll all be good for it if you<br>ever need it back it's it is a fiat<br>currency promise thank you that's really<br>useful I'm just going to check if there<br>are any questions from the floor yes<br>this is probably the last one<br>better be good<br>no pressure<br>Adrian the answer yeah so um given that<br>you've been talking about digital<br>currency and so we're looking at the<br>balance sheet of uh tepute are you<br>having any issues that the Deutsche<br>blunders bank is currently having with<br>uh a very bad p l with all their very<br>low paying bonds that they're holding is<br>that something that's emerging for<br>tiputia matua well I notice an emotion<br>there<br>um what is the balance sheet of a<br>central bank<br>the central bank doesn't even need<br>Equity we print the stuff<br>so it's the world where accountants have<br>met the world of economics<br>and at the moment Central Bank Mark to<br>markets around the world are either<br>positive or negative it doesn't make any<br>difference to the actual Central Bank<br>Unless somehow their credibility is is<br>being attacked I.E you're printing money<br>with no sense of ever making it low<br>stable inflation through time so that's<br>the Venezuela or the Zimbabwe or the<br>Argentina meanwhile central banks who<br>are committed to low and stable<br>inflation and have that credibility the<br>equity and the balance sheet is is<br>effectively noise<br>so um but wow it looks different oh I<br>haven't seen that before and I was told<br>in accounting you know you must have<br>positive equity in this so it hurts the<br>brain<br>but you need to exercise that brain and<br>there's some wonderful reading around<br>central bank balance sheets the bis are<br>out on their public Mission at the<br>moment to explain to people calm down<br>it's okay I love the U.S federal<br>reserves balance sheet they are always<br>square at the end of the day because the<br>way they do it is their Equity is the<br>discounted future senior Rich that they<br>get and so magically it balances off<br>each day I'll let you think about that<br>so my point was actually more the p l<br>um I know the Deutsche bundes Bank was<br>um you know obviously pays out surpluses<br>and it pays deposits for its retail<br>Banks it's got into a position where in<br>fact the money that it's earning of its<br>portfolio is significantly less than the<br>deposit if money it's paying out I mean<br>again it could well be just an<br>accounting issue rather than a real<br>issue but it's certainly something<br>that's quite live okay it's making<br>headlines it's a reputational challenge<br>you know that's about about balancing<br>reputation operational Financial legal<br>risk reputational if you've said our<br>reputations based on us having positive<br>capital and then you don't well you've<br>got some explaining to do<br>um uh The Reserve Bank is quite unique<br>and I won't say optimal it's just unique<br>at how it is we were given a slugger<br>capital and we're told to pay dividends<br>anything over above or below that that<br>Capital<br>um but quite what that Capital means<br>um I'll leave it to<br>um the bis to explain to the public<br>thank you all right thank you Adrian<br>much appreciated<br>thank you<br>excellent thanks again I should say uh<br>special note Adrian I think you've<br>spoken here for the last three years you<br>mentioned uh Mata being a learning<br>organization we certainly appreciate<br>your participation in your team's<br>participation and openness to these<br>discussions so Kia Ora thank you for<br>being here we are moving now to a<br>session uh that's in some senses is<br>underpinned of many of our other<br>discussions over the last day or so<br>which is about governance and populism<br>how does democracy work in a digital age<br>a work welcome back up Anna strut just a<br>note the extremely rare fog situation in<br>the waikato has meant that one of our<br>speakers flight has been diverted so<br>he'll be coming in over zoom and another<br>of our speakers is based in London so<br>we'll have a couple on Zoom for this<br>session but I'll hand over to you now<br>Anna<br>foreign<br>well thank you very much<br>um for that session this morning we're<br>looking forward to coming back to<br>monetary policy after this session but<br>we're going to take a little bit of a<br>break from monetary policy at the moment<br>and this first panel this morning is one<br>many of us have been particularly<br>looking forward to of course<br>it's got to focus on governance and<br>populism<br>particularly the implications of<br>democracy in a digital age<br>we've got four speakers our first<br>speakers will be Professor Al Gillespie<br>he is here at the law school of the<br>University of waikato our second speaker<br>is Josie Pagani Josie is a public<br>affairs consultant and a media<br>commentator Pagani agency<br>um our third speaker is Ben garan he is<br>based in London so oh there he is<br>morning or evening or whatever it is for<br>you Ben<br>and our fourth speaker was Patrick we<br>knew that there was a little bit of a<br>risk with his flight so we did Place him<br>at the end of the panel but it was a bit<br>more of a risk than we'd anticipated and<br>of course Patrick is joining us by Zoom<br>as well so with that welcome to the<br>panelists very excited to hear what what<br>insights they're going to bring and<br>please do store up your questions as<br>well because we will take questions from<br>the floor and from slido following the<br>initial remarks of up to five minutes<br>each<br>completely up to you most of them are<br>spoken here but if you prefer sleeping<br>Okay Marina<br>um kiratato I'm Al Gillespie I'm going<br>to just speak for five minutes about the<br>the international environment that we're<br>currently in and it I've been thinking a<br>lot about it lately but the person I<br>really miss right now is Monica Lewinsky<br>and that's um that's an age-appropriate<br>joke but there was there wasn't a time<br>when<br>international issues were about the<br>mistakes of the president and we were in<br>a utopian point where we thought<br>everything was getting better and had I<br>gone to someone who had a crystal ball<br>at that time and said what what's the<br>future hold and they said well there's a<br>global pandemic there's<br>um<br>there's there's a war on terror<br>there's terrorism in New Zealand I say I<br>want my money back I don't believe it<br>this can't be true and I was trying to<br>explain this to my students the other<br>day that there's been certain points<br>where everything changed and I said like<br>one of them was September the 11th 2001<br>it's one of those days you will always<br>remember where you were and they looked<br>at me and I couldn't work out what was<br>going on until I realized that half of<br>them hadn't been born and and the world<br>has changed so much in this time and<br>then when you get to the point where we<br>are today and the major concern I have<br>is the unsustainable nature of the war<br>in the Ukraine because what we're seeing<br>is over one year is a continual<br>escalation<br>Putin is not going to run out of bullets<br>he is not going to run out of money but<br>what he may run out of is men he has now<br>lost over 100 000 soldiers and the<br>problem that Putin faces is what the<br>Americans faced in Vietnam if the<br>Russian wives and the Russian mothers<br>love their children as much as the<br>Americans did then the greatest enemy is<br>not the external one it's the internal<br>one and this means that there will be<br>pressure for him to do something<br>different<br>we're at a point where International<br>arms control and security control is in<br>free fall we have lost nine major<br>agreements since 2001. not all of it is<br>the Russian fault some of it is the<br>American fault some of the mistakes that<br>were made were learned by each other<br>but right now you're in a point which is<br>very similar to the Spanish Civil War<br>where the Ukraine has become a proxy<br>Battleground between two sides this is<br>not just a military risk it is an<br>economic risk because what you're seeing<br>is a move back to self-sufficiency<br>globalization is beginning to fracture<br>and the Temptation for countries to act<br>in a unilateral manner is unprecedented<br>in the last 20 years<br>the big thing that's changed recently is<br>that China is now on the cusp and that<br>remarkable panda bear has done an<br>incredible job balancing on a very thin<br>wall for one year over which way it's<br>going to go but discussion now is<br>whether China will become a non-neutral<br>state and start providing weapons to<br>Russia<br>the only restraint on China is the arms<br>trade treaty and American pressure the<br>arms trade treaty says you cannot<br>provide weapons to a country if it's<br>going to undermine peace and security or<br>cause crimes against humanity<br>The Tipping Point is China at the same<br>point has now put on a peace proposal<br>onto the table last night they've called<br>for a ceasefire on the major belligerent<br>involved in the conflict<br>my expectation is that if the peace plan<br>of China does not succeed then you will<br>see them move to a non-neutral position<br>which would be very similar to where New<br>Zealand is right now<br>the challenge that creates for us is<br>huge because the United States will have<br>two options option one you will increase<br>the flow of material and support for the<br>Ukraine option two you sanction China in<br>a much more direct way than we currently<br>have and if this happened they would<br>expect us to behave in a like-minded way<br>here's the good news the Chinese peace<br>proposal the 12 points is a good idea<br>it's better than the Russian approach<br>the Russians don't do peace proposals<br>the Russians expect their opponents to<br>surrender you can think of Georgia you<br>can think of chechnya you can think of<br>Syria they don't normally negotiate<br>there's Hawks on the west and the Hawks<br>on the west want Russia completely out<br>of the Ukraine they want criminals to be<br>brought to account they want restoration<br>and there's no middle ground there<br>zielinski put up his peace plan at the<br>end of last year and the Chinese peace<br>plan is quite similar<br>the good thing is that they support<br>territorial Integrity the role of the<br>United Nations and the importance of<br>international law<br>they're calling for a rethink on<br>military alliances like with NATO and<br>we've done this once before we did this<br>in 1991 we built up that framework and<br>we can do it again<br>but where it's Unique is that the<br>Chinese have said we've got to focus<br>more on unilateral sanctions and the<br>importance of Global Supply chains and<br>this is their concern because they're<br>worried that the international market is<br>no longer stable<br>so<br>to put it into some kind of context<br>where does this mean that we go now as a<br>country I've got three suggestions that<br>I think are worthy of debate first thing<br>give peace a chance if the Chinese have<br>put up a peace proposal on the table<br>it's not perfect there's a long way to<br>go but we need to be supportive of any<br>efforts to try to get away out of this<br>unsustainable War<br>two what do we do with the Ukraine first<br>keep up the good diplomatic work support<br>international law that is working<br>we need to consider also to do more with<br>regards to refugees and I would argue<br>that New Zealand has a particular<br>responsibility for any conflict which we<br>are involved in and this is above and<br>beyond our normal ethical<br>responsibilities three keep providing<br>military assistance and that at the<br>moment we are disproportionate to what<br>we give compared to our friends and<br>allies we don't have the same Tech when<br>they have discussions about tanks and<br>fighter planes we just look kind of<br>blank because we can't do that but we<br>can do certain things with like armored<br>vehicles and we can listen to what they<br>need the main thing they need is money<br>and it's important to support them and<br>then we have to think about us and this<br>is where it gets really hard because<br>it's not just the Ukraine we have to<br>think about our alliances we are facing<br>once in a generation questions right now<br>these are things that we went to sleep<br>in 1991 and we thought we were going to<br>live happily ever after and Monica<br>Lewinsky was where it was going to be<br>but now we've woken up and the world is<br>different we have to think about what we<br>stand for and who we stand with anzus is<br>Frozen it's not dead it's frozen<br>but the problem we have is that it's not<br>anzas we wouldn't fight for America but<br>we would fight for Australia and we are<br>linked by a treaty in 1944 if Australia<br>gets into a fight we get into a fight<br>but we have to think where do we sit<br>what do we stand for second thing how<br>much are we going to spend right now<br>there's an arms race in the world going<br>on we spend 1.5 percent of our GDP on<br>the military the NATO average is now two<br>percent and it's escalating<br>this is a difficult choice because every<br>dollar you spend has got opportunity<br>cost and so if you spend a dollar on a<br>frigate that's a dollar that's not going<br>to be spent on social housing<br>but we have to start working out are we<br>going to pay more<br>three we have to think about the types<br>of the military that we have Warfare in<br>the future as you can see in the Ukraine<br>is not what it was in the 20th century<br>the technology has changed it's<br>artificial intelligence it's Hypersonic<br>it's a completely different platform if<br>we're going to send our woman and our<br>men and the New Zealand military forces<br>into any combat zone they need to have<br>the best equipment<br>this all comes down to one large<br>question it's about our identity do we<br>see ourselves as a regional police<br>officer or do we see ourselves as part<br>of a much larger deterrent against a<br>emerging Force which may need to be<br>confronted<br>that's it thank you very much Al wow<br>bleak<br>but interesting I'm going to make a<br>prediction about the future of liberal<br>democracies like ours which is a<br>complete Fool's game I know<br>um and in fact as I was coming here this<br>morning I found an anecdote which<br>perfectly uh illustrates the um Fool's<br>game of trying to do forecasts Noble<br>Laureate Economist Kenneth Arrow I'm<br>sure many of you know in the second<br>world war<br>um he he was given a a duty as a weather<br>forecaster for the U.S army this is<br>during World War II He was ordered to<br>evaluate the mathematical models for<br>predicting the weather a month in<br>advance found out that they were<br>completely useless informed of this his<br>superiors sent back another order the<br>Commanding General is well aware that<br>the forecasts are no good however he<br>needs them for his planning<br>so yeah what I'm about to say may be<br>completely useless and ill-informed but<br>um<br>here goes my experience uh I guess is is<br>across working in politics working for<br>Global think tanks Global progress Tony<br>Blair Institute and others and also<br>doing media commentary as well I'm<br>working in Aid in development in the<br>Pacific in particular<br>um and I think liberal democracy is in<br>real trouble uh the last couple of years<br>we've seen I think the the worst drop in<br>the lowest levels of democracy seen in<br>30 years so there are fewer democracies<br>and fewer Democratic processes within<br>countries we may well have lived through<br>the end of a brief interlude in history<br>of liberal democracy and and of the<br>Rises of democracies and<br>anti-colonialism that we've seen since<br>the second world war in the second half<br>of this of the 20th century defined the<br>second half of that Century its collapse<br>could be the defining trend of the 21st<br>century I think we're in real trouble<br>unless we fight back and and of course<br>I'm suggesting we fight back and and I'm<br>probably a little bit more muscular than<br>Al Give Peace a chance well uh you know<br>I look at Ukraine because where are the<br>attacks on liberal democracy coming from<br>let's start with Ukraine I look at<br>Ukraine and go well uh not no war in<br>Ukraine means no fighting for the<br>Russians it means no Ukraine for the<br>ukrainians and and let's be absolutely<br>clear that Putin was triggered not by an<br>expansion of NATO but by an expansion of<br>democracy so this is our fight and they<br>are us<br>and I and I look at what we've done well<br>first of all I look at the the Ukrainian<br>version of nationalism which is<br>amazingly hopeful actually in this fight<br>for Liberal democracy it's a very Civic<br>nationalism you know it's not ethnic<br>nationalism that the Ukrainian sense of<br>being Ukrainian<br>incorporates Russian speakers Ukrainian<br>speakers migrants it's a Civic kind of<br>nationalism which is wonderful and not<br>an ethnic nationalism and they take huge<br>pride in in fighting for the values that<br>we hold dear the L has outlined uh you<br>know tolerance liberal democracy<br>Democratic processes freedom of speech I<br>think it's appalling that the Russian<br>Ambassador is sitting in his comfortable<br>office in mazine Street in Wellington<br>with a yellow highlighter highlighting<br>the names of new zealanders who have<br>become enemies of the state of Russia<br>for for calling out and standing up for<br>Liberal democracy<br>so the second I suppose strand of this<br>debate is the is uh the attacks on<br>liberal values from populism the rise of<br>populist movements on the left and the<br>right<br>and we've talked yesterday the theme<br>that came through was the sort of<br>decline in the trust of Institutions the<br>trust of governments it's interesting we<br>talk about populism as if it's a bad<br>thing I mean the word populist I mean<br>some of the best uh changes in history<br>have been populist movements<br>anti-slavery Civil Rights Movement votes<br>for women these are all populist<br>movements you know polite people don't<br>change the world<br>so I think we have to look at the appeal<br>of populism rather than just going you<br>know this is a very negative thing what<br>are the what's the appeal the appeal is<br>that it's so optimistic it's optimistic<br>it promises transformation we're going<br>to make your life better you've been<br>left behind we're going to stand up for<br>you it's incredibly optimistic and we we<br>kind of don't recognize that when we're<br>so sort of uh terrified of the populist<br>movement<br>so what do we do about the negative rise<br>of of populism well I think we need to<br>move away from what I call the the<br>mingvas politicians we need fewer<br>mingvas politicians I.E politicians who<br>kind of you know behave like they're<br>walking on a polished floor holding a<br>Priceless mingvars and they're afraid of<br>you know dropping it you know we need<br>politicians who are prepared to take<br>risks who are you know on a moral<br>crusade to stand up for Liberal values<br>and I was trying to think what's the<br>opposite of a mingvas politician what do<br>I actually mean maybe it's a I don't<br>know politician with a tray of drinks<br>walking across a crowded Dance Floor you<br>know I want politicians like that and<br>these are the kinds of politicians I<br>think or and it doesn't have to be in<br>politics I mean you know political<br>leaders can come from all sorts of<br>centers of of power but take back the<br>optimism of populism promise the<br>transformation that populism promises<br>deliver more of a share of the economy<br>to people who feel left behind and<br>that's how you deal with optimism not<br>othering them not excommunicating people<br>and I think in New Zealand the left and<br>the right have made populism worse and<br>and the sort of nascent rise of it in<br>New Zealand those on the right need to<br>realize that yes free markets capitalism<br>have lifted more people out of poverty<br>than anything in history it's been a<br>huge success<br>but the rising tide didn't lift all<br>boats some sank and no one in a small<br>New Zealand Town said well I've lost my<br>job but at least aggregate wages have<br>gone up<br>so the right has to have something to<br>say about inequality it's a little bit<br>like only Nixon could go to China I mean<br>you imagine of Tomorrow Christopher<br>luxon gets up and talks about inequality<br>uses the word even and God forbid even<br>redistribution<br>and then on the left the left in New<br>Zealand need to stop trying to make us<br>better people and go back to trying to<br>make us better off you know there's a<br>there's a sort of tilted head of<br>compassion approach a friend of mine in<br>the UK once said Tony Blair political<br>advisor and he said you know it used to<br>be that people joined the labor party to<br>make their lives better off in their<br>Community now they join the labor party<br>to make somebody else's life better off<br>so somehow that that diversity of voices<br>in our politics has gone and it's<br>leading to the kind of populism we're<br>seeing and how I would class that is<br>that we're divided now in our politics<br>between the knowledge class those who<br>who have knowledge capital and those who<br>have property and and wealth and own<br>houses and at the property class<br>um or if you like the Haves and the Have<br>yachts<br>what's missing in that division is the<br>rise that the strong voice of working<br>new zealanders of of working class new<br>zealanders and funnily enough it's only<br>middle class people who ask me to Define<br>working class but here's a stat because<br>Brad said if you can have a stat you'll<br>impress anybody so here's the stats<br>um 40 of new zealanders have no Capital<br>at all so that's no tertiary<br>degrees or knowledge capital and no<br>property but Parliament over 90 percent<br>of people in Parliament have a tertiary<br>degree and have knowledge or property<br>and probably both so our politics has<br>become far less representative that has<br>to change and social media hasn't it<br>caused the populism that we're seeing in<br>the world today it's exacerbated it and<br>I and I look forward to talking more<br>about how we can manage that not by<br>Banning hate speech incidentally there<br>are other things we can do more<br>effectively but to finally end back to<br>Ukraine where um I agree with you Al<br>there's a lot more that we should and<br>could be doing what we've done is pretty<br>pathetic we've sanctioned oligarchs<br>associated with Putin which is a bit<br>like canceling a lunch date with you<br>know the cartel drug cartel it's like<br>it's the least we can do it's not happen<br>for lunch and I think new zealanders<br>have shown what it's like and often<br>again populist movement if you like New<br>Zealand has shown what it's like to<br>fight a muscular<br>optimistic<br>courageous fight for Liberal values and<br>principles and democracy when people<br>like myself and probably some of you in<br>this room were personally sanctioned by<br>Putin we did what any good fighting kiwi<br>should do our response was pretty<br>unified we basically said Russian<br>warship go yourself<br>so that's the kind of politics I think<br>we need to fight for Liberal democracy<br>thank you<br>there's some interesting and pretty deep<br>themes that are coming through already<br>so um we'll go straight over to you<br>though Ben if that's um okay and we'll<br>pick up the questions after you and<br>Patrick<br>brilliant thanks very much thank you<br>Alan Josie for giving us a you know<br>really interesting<br>um backdrop to this discussion by<br>looking at the international position<br>particularly with the war in Ukraine and<br>also the you know effect on now domestic<br>politics by factors like populism and<br>you know I think what's most interesting<br>about you know having a discussion like<br>this is thinking about where does it<br>come from and what's making it worse you<br>know the big question for me is what<br>impact is the rise and you know changes<br>in digital media consumption having on<br>our democracies and I say our<br>democracies because these things can<br>have quite different effects uh in New<br>Zealand to here in the UK to another<br>developing markets as well and that's<br>something that you know I think is<br>really interesting to talk about it's<br>also a really fascinating time to have<br>this discussion<br>years there have been in you know an<br>enormous number of um uh it's a really<br>healthy debates around the challenges of<br>fake news around hate speech the role of<br>echo Chambers and the in the way that<br>our personally curated media<br>environments on social media are so<br>different to the days of everyone<br>getting the news from newspapers TV and<br>radio where we all had pretty consistent<br>news diets and we know there's been so<br>much research done into this that when<br>you have Echo Chambers on social media<br>that leads to polarization it leads to<br>radicalization and all the negative<br>effects that come with that and so these<br>factors have mainly come about over the<br>last few years by the rise of<br>follower-based platforms on social media<br>like Facebook like Twitter like<br>Instagram and on platforms like this the<br>people that you follow with the pages or<br>celebrities all your friends and family<br>dictate the type of news and content<br>that you get and that's some of the most<br>important factors that decide you know<br>how you see the content you see on these<br>platforms but what we've seen in the<br>last few years is the rise of tech talk<br>and the flow I want to think that that's<br>had on the digital ecosystem<br>increasingly the time that people are<br>spending online is with platforms with<br>the content that they're being shown<br>isn't related to who they follow it's<br>related to their personal preferences<br>and algorithmic recommendations based<br>off what people you know likely Trends<br>and consumption behaviors and this<br>exacerbates a lot of these challenges<br>that we're talking about in digital<br>media and it also opens up some new ones<br>for example you know Tick Tock have you<br>know tried to win some new press in the<br>last few days by introducing a 60 Minute<br>time limit on on teenagers I mean you<br>know for any teenagers or parents or<br>teenagers in the room I mean good luck<br>you know hoping that that's going to be<br>enough to you know you know Tick Tock<br>addiction from young people<br>well that comes into response to a lot<br>of criticism that tick tock's been<br>having around number one you know the<br>general addictive nature of their<br>product you know which which it is you<br>know more addictive than meth basically<br>but secondly is there are much broader<br>concerns with tech talk around the data<br>that they collect a lot of that debate<br>has been around people's personal data<br>being exposed to Tech talk that's why<br>it's been banned<br>um uh you know the app's been banned in<br>the US among Federal um uh federal<br>government employees there's been a<br>threat in New Zealand around whether the<br>same could apply here but the real<br>challenge I think isn't just about the<br>Chinese government potentially having<br>access to your individual data the real<br>challenge is what the Chinese government<br>could have access to do with that data<br>at a really aggregate level because the<br>real Battleground on digital media over<br>the next decade isn't going to be about<br>tech talk or Instagram or Facebook it's<br>going to be about which AI platforms are<br>most pervasive and which in which<br>institutions are shaping those platforms<br>we've all already seen the rise of chat<br>GPT and other AI platforms that are<br>accessible to you know individuals and<br>businesses to help change the way we<br>work and communicate well the Chinese<br>government has access through the 2021<br>data security law to any corporate data<br>of any Chinese firm any firm operating<br>in China or Chinese firm operating<br>overseas that means they have access to<br>the largest potential data set into<br>human behavior what motivates us what<br>makes us watch things what makes us<br>click things what sort of products do we<br>like to buy everything that we do within<br>the tech talk ecosystem has the risk of<br>being shaped into an AI that has you<br>know the Chinese government have access<br>to that's the really scary stuff that I<br>think we're going to be facing in the<br>coming years but back to the issues at<br>hand now because we've got more than<br>enough on our plate there's a study<br>published in nature in 2021 that looked<br>at around 500 different studies into the<br>linkages between this is a meta study<br>between digital media and and and<br>democracy it pulled out a few factors it<br>said that digital media leads to<br>increased political participation and<br>increased information consumption and<br>these are widely accepted to be good<br>things it also pulled out that it leads<br>to declining trust and institutions that<br>shows you've spoken about increased<br>populism which is Jose as you said can<br>be a good or a bad thing and growing<br>polarization and these last three tend<br>to be detrimental especially in<br>established democracies<br>um and and you know I think there's um<br>there's a really interesting theme<br>coming through that in emerging<br>democracies the balance of the effective<br>digital media tends to be positive<br>because it puts more pressure on<br>authoritarian leaders it opens up<br>information for debate and it can be<br>really complementary to the news media<br>which is often a mature or Alexa respect<br>or that lets the networks and and sort<br>of trust to be able to cut through but<br>in established democracies digital media<br>can be a much greater threat<br>and that comes through in another study<br>that came out last year by Pew research<br>the 19 different countries and asked the<br>question do you think social media is a<br>Force for good or a force for bad and<br>overall 57 of the people in these<br>countries believed it was a Force for<br>good but in countries like the us there<br>was only 34 whereas in Poland and<br>Hungary and other emerging democracies<br>that number was Far higher at 65 percent<br>or higher what that tells us is that<br>when we talk about the effect between<br>digital media and democracy there are<br>very different stories playing out in<br>different corners of the globe and<br>that's something that we need to be<br>aware of it's not as binary as just<br>Facebook's bad or you know increasing<br>political participation is good it's a<br>nuanced discussion that is very<br>conditional on the context of where<br>we're talking and that's why I think<br>it's really interesting you know because<br>as you're saying about the populism<br>debate the rise of populism isn't just<br>down to digital media it's down to a<br>range of factors but it often cases is<br>replacing and the inability of Centrist<br>politicians to connect and deliver a<br>relatable message to to the public and<br>that shows that we've got a democracy<br>deficit that political leaders need to<br>step up to and find ways to get their<br>message to cut through and I'll end with<br>one example of this where we've done it<br>here in the UK which is you know the<br>question of brexit has been a polarizing<br>political deadlock in this country from<br>the referendum day up until up until you<br>know prison days and it led to a<br>stagnation in Parliament chaos and delay<br>as your legislation wasn't getting<br>through and it led to the collapse of<br>Theresa May's government<br>when Boris Johnson came in as as prime<br>minister and sort of was lumped the you<br>know rather sort of difficult task of<br>trying to get this whole brexit thing<br>out of the way it was yes a populist<br>message that helps to achieve that the<br>tagline of get brexit done<br>appealed to Broad Streets of the<br>population and led to a historic 80<br>majority for a very simple reason it<br>presented a unifying proposition to both<br>leave voters who wanted brexit to happen<br>but also people that didn't vote for<br>brexit at all that just wanted the<br>deadlock And Delay to be over with and<br>what that tells us is that there's an<br>opportunity to find Common Ground even<br>in a polarized political environment and<br>through using simple effective messaging<br>to cut through and these are the sorts<br>of things that can help improve the<br>state of our democracies but there's<br>plenty more work to be done and many<br>bigger challenges on the horizon cheers<br>thank you uh I'm coming to you from<br>Tauranga airport as you know with an<br>unstable internet connection so please<br>excuse me if there's any leg or a drop<br>out and up until recently I was age for<br>20 years<br>um most recently eight years as the<br>editorial editor-in-chief club and stuff<br>last year I spent three months at<br>Cambridge University where I was<br>researching faster I need to begin so I<br>was particularly focused on news media<br>but I think a lot of what I learned was<br>broadly applicable Beyond journalism to<br>other mainstream institutions so I<br>approached today's topic<br>um from the point of view of Earth media<br>and through a lens of stuff and I wanted<br>to make Four Points by way of uh opening<br>remarks the first point is that our<br>information ecosystem is unhealthy it's<br>an interesting London School of<br>Economics Report from a few years ago<br>that talked about five information evils<br>that are prevalent in our era confusion<br>cynicism fragmentation irresponsibility<br>and empathy and cumulatively they add up<br>to a situation where citizens often<br>aren't sure what's true where consensus<br>and agreed facts are harder to come by<br>and where a lot of the power of the flow<br>of information is held by organizations<br>that lack ethics or accountability which<br>connects to the point they're being made<br>earlier about a big issue in the coming<br>decade being who controls those AI<br>platforms<br>um and also a situation where citizens<br>disengage with or lose faith in the<br>structures of society<br>point two is that trust matters or good<br>government and its absences it's<br>relevant to connected to a factor in the<br>have written about democracy requiring<br>vertical trust when the government<br>apparatus and the uh the families are<br>Governor but also horizontal trust<br>between the people and society and that<br>you need both of those for democracy to<br>function in a robust and healthy way and<br>that when those trust links deteriorate<br>in a very significant consequences and<br>that's relevant because as I gather has<br>been discussed previously trust and keys<br>but<br>I take a slightly contrary view on trust<br>being in crisis because I also think<br>that the data tends to show that chronic<br>low trust is not any new thing<br>it might be something that we are uh<br>newly conscious of<br>um and that is more apparent with a the<br>flowering of the forces that has been<br>sent into physical media but trust in<br>the government and the politician and<br>and the media is actually perennially<br>low in most comfortable<br>so point four is that that suggested to<br>me that it's while it's important to<br>address the health of our information<br>ecosystem that's not enough by itself<br>um and that we have to look at the<br>fundamentals of trust one of the things<br>from my research that really captured my<br>attention is that there are four traits<br>that are required for a robust trust<br>relationship to form you need competence<br>reliability integrity and benevolence so<br>that's like uh can you do the job<br>will you actually do the job will you<br>deal with me honestly and are you acting<br>in my best interests and if we look at<br>some of the disengages different<br>franchise groups in our society and the<br>events that were significant to the<br>deterioration across for them you can<br>often see that from their point of view<br>there's been a failing and one in War of<br>those points<br>trust is hard to build hard to maintain<br>very easy to lose<br>um but public actors who want to<br>maintain trust you should actively shape<br>their behavior not just their their<br>messaging or the rhetoric but their<br>actual Behavior to demonstrate that<br>competence and reliability as an<br>thank you Anna thank you thank you thank<br>you very much Patrick thank you very<br>much to all of our panelists for those<br>um starting comments those Rich insights<br>and and I'm looking forward to questions<br>please wave out if you've got questions<br>from the floor that you would like to<br>thank you I've got two points or two one<br>is I agree with Jerry that trust and<br>um<br>politicians have always exaggerated and<br>they've always made the odd misstatement<br>now and again but we've actually seen in<br>Western democracies politicians who have<br>lied openly now Donald Trump is the<br>clear example but brexit was one on the<br>basis of Lies and those politicians are<br>still in politics<br>and now when you see speeches from Biden<br>even in on American they fact check the<br>speeches<br>so it's become a fact that people almost<br>expected politicians to lie and I think<br>that is a big change we we never we we<br>sort of trusted politicians to<br>exaggerate but not to lie but now<br>they've been lying and that and we<br>shouldn't be surprised that people have<br>lost trust in their political<br>institutions the other institution you<br>you haven't mentioned uh that's quite<br>important is the legal system<br>um I've worked for a long time in<br>Eastern Europe where people don't trust<br>a legal system going to court is like<br>going to a casino you have no idea<br>what's going to happen it totally<br>changes the way people behave and what<br>the way business operates I think in New<br>Zealand we still basically have trust in<br>the legal system I would say I'd never<br>been to court<br>but I was pretty confident that if I did<br>it would be fair it would be relatively<br>quick and the outcome would be based on<br>facts but in countries where that<br>doesn't exist you really have a major<br>problem<br>I'm going to suggest thanks for that I'm<br>going to suggest maybe Al if you want to<br>make some brief comments on legal system<br>and trusts and then uh Patrick you might<br>want to comment on trusts and Josie and<br>Ben if you want to afterwards I'm<br>suggesting that order thank you uh the<br>world Justice project and as an analysis<br>every year of legal systems around the<br>world and it's an extensive collection<br>New Zealand comes in consistently for<br>the last three years at seventh the best<br>in the world and and we should be very<br>proud about this and to actually build a<br>system that has that kind of integrity<br>and robustness requires a lot of<br>legislation and a lot of trust in it as<br>well but but your pointer to create the<br>system is good in New Zealand the<br>challenge is maintaining it but that's<br>not just with the Judiciary that's also<br>with the police and ensuring that the<br>public and they generally do trust it<br>but that always requires having<br>independent oversight and having steps<br>available to make sure that when there<br>are mistakes made that they can be<br>up jumping<br>um I I at the record being too simpler<br>um I would also make the point that if<br>we're thinking about trust in a New<br>Zealand context we should look at the<br>New Zealand content and it's important<br>to not take too many cues from uh<br>overseas jurisdiction particularly<br>America America leans really large and<br>all sorts of conversations and political<br>discourse and international ideas and<br>discussions about journalism and media<br>but America isn't a representative<br>example America is a unique case in in<br>almost all indexes of performance<br>America is a a real outlier and Trust in<br>the news in particular it's a real<br>outlier it's at the very bottom of<br>almost all of the countries surveys so<br>it certainly um possible that New<br>Zealand picked up Echoes of trends that<br>start in America but usually not when<br>using the air and pronounce<br>um as the phenomenon is happening in<br>America so I think we also have to be a<br>little bit cautious about looking at<br>those International examples and<br>assuming the same points hold through<br>New Zealand<br>thanks Patrick Joseph did you want to go<br>yeah I saw some uh data I think this<br>week maybe it's the one stuff you're<br>referring to Patrick of a drop in<br>message drop and trust with media<br>globally and New Zealand wasn't in the<br>in the data but it's pretty alarming and<br>I think uh fukuyama describes the<br>institutions of liberal democracies as<br>as the canary in the mine that when you<br>when people start to lose trust in the<br>institutions whether it's the public<br>sector whether it's uh you know MB<br>whether it's Parliament whether it's<br>slick committees you know or whether<br>it's it's the apparatus of Courts and<br>the police and so on<br>um it's a quick step from that to losing<br>trust in the political system and then<br>trusting democracy and an alarming<br>statistic I came across last year uh<br>when I was in the UK the Tony Blair<br>Institute had done this data 30 of<br>British people that's 14 million by the<br>way would rather have a strong leader<br>who could get things done get brexit<br>done Ben then go through a parliamentary<br>process of you know processing slowing<br>it down and getting things like 14<br>million people in the UK would rather<br>bypass Parliament so I think this is<br>where I think we're in real trouble<br>that's salami I grew up in England and<br>um that's that's pretty shocking data<br>the other thing I would say about<br>growing up in England too with brexit is<br>that you know I went to a local state<br>school comprehensive school then I went<br>to University everyone I went to school<br>with very working class Community I grew<br>up in cleaning my brother all voted<br>brexit everyone I went to University<br>with voted remain and so again it comes<br>to this division in politics that if if<br>we're if we're simply saying that people<br>we disagree with parliamentary protests<br>and so I kind of we demonize them we're<br>going to end up with a growing lack of<br>trust I think in the institutions and<br>therefore in in democracy liberal<br>democracy generally and we we can't do<br>that we're too small country to<br>excommunicate people who start to lose<br>trust because we're related to half of<br>them unfortunately so<br>then was there anything that you wanted<br>to add in from your position in the UK<br>yeah look I think it's um it's really<br>easy to say oh gosh you know trust in<br>institutions is failing it's probably<br>social media's fault<br>um if people didn't face as much<br>everyone would all be happier but you<br>know what our political leaders globally<br>and our institutions have failed on many<br>issues we've failed to do enough about<br>climate change in New Zealand we've<br>failed to fix the housing crisis we've<br>failed to build the infrastructure that<br>we need we've failed on so many ways we<br>have for Generations unlike multiple<br>sides of politics it's a systematic<br>issue that does actually need to be<br>addressed my generation are the first<br>generation in a century who are going to<br>have a lower standard of living than<br>their parents my generation are less<br>likely to own their own homes we don't<br>expect our retirement savings to be<br>guaranteed by the government because we<br>just assume that the economy will be<br>completely by then and half of us have<br>depression because we think that the<br>world's going to burn to a crisp in 10<br>years like I exaggerate but these are<br>really serious issues and then you<br>wonder why we have low trusts and<br>institutions social media video sure it<br>doesn't help some aspects of this but<br>there are very real challenges that<br>haven't been addressed by our<br>institutions and our leaders that need<br>to be and until they are we're going to<br>see the situation getting worse but you<br>know what social media can and should be<br>part of the solution the survey I<br>mentioned earlier about a surveying 19<br>countries do you think social media is a<br>Force for good or bad for democracy and<br>every single country surveyed young<br>people believe that social media was a<br>positive factor for democracy it leads<br>to explaining things in ways that appeal<br>to young people it leads to building<br>communities and causes that young people<br>care about whether it's me too or<br>climate change or anything else and what<br>it tells us is that politicians<br>political institutions parliaments<br>libraries you know Ministries<br>journalists need to show up and do<br>prison on these platforms where people<br>are and we seems some fantastic work for<br>many in the media community and<br>journalists about being proactive on<br>social media and engaging you see<br>piecemeal samples from governments<br>around the world this is my challenge<br>like get out there and get on these<br>platforms where people are communicating<br>and start taking responsibility for the<br>issues that our political leaders need<br>to be dealing with<br>thanks Ben and that um takes me nicely<br>into a question that I've got through<br>from online the digital world that we<br>find ourselves in currently is a huge<br>challenge but also an enabler and you've<br>talked about some of those enabling<br>factors how can we manage this tension<br>to ensure that democracy is able to<br>thrive and you've given us a few ideas<br>there Ben so I don't know if you'd like<br>to start an ad anymore before we turn to<br>the other panelists but how can we um<br>yep how can we make sure democracy look<br>I think the best place to start is to<br>split out what are actually some of the<br>different nuanced uh problems here<br>because it's very easy to lump<br>everything into oh that's a digital<br>issue but if you look at the things that<br>you do on a day everything's digital you<br>know when you're without your smartphone<br>you know every business that you<br>interact with has an online presence you<br>know we talked we heard earlier about<br>cryptocurrencies for the central bank<br>and what does it matter we pay for<br>everything with our phones anyway you<br>know if what we're doing is digital<br>explain to me what isn't digital so we<br>need to get better at using vocabulary<br>to break down the different types of<br>challenges that exist within the digital<br>media environment so we've got a few<br>right you know we've talked a lot about<br>trust and institutions some you know one<br>of the places we can start by doing that<br>is by institutions really putting in<br>more effort to turn up and communicate<br>and take action another issue is around<br>populism and populism represents a lack<br>of Engagement from political Leaders<br>with issues that people are concerned<br>about and there are all sorts of<br>structural vectors that are outside the<br>scope of this panel about why politics<br>is moving in different places but what<br>it means is that when there's a gap for<br>a populist movement that other political<br>leaders need to respond and actually<br>listen to what these people are getting<br>upset about you know when working class<br>voters in the midwest voted for Trump<br>they did so because they felt like the<br>Democratic party had left them behind on<br>values and policies that's why they<br>voted Trump right and so the you know<br>political leaders need to respond to<br>that so those are a couple of examples<br>of how you know we can actually by<br>splitting up these challenges respond to<br>them in separate ways a lot of people<br>say well actually if we just bend and<br>regulate ban or regulated these digital<br>platforms then our problems would go<br>away well it's not that simple you know<br>we it might be easier to say oh look<br>maybe we should just separate Facebook<br>app so they don't own Facebook and<br>Instagram but the bigger threat out<br>there is Tick Tock and if you break that<br>up if you regulate that something else<br>will come along we actually need to take<br>responsibility as a society as<br>individuals and institutions for one<br>putting in more good than bad because<br>all social media does is reflect back to<br>us what we put into it so we all need to<br>look at look at our own behavior and you<br>know the comments that we make online<br>and everything and ask if we can do<br>better and secondly start taking<br>seriously these issues that are being<br>accentuated by social media so if social<br>media is telling us that there's a rise<br>of populism don't blame it on the<br>algorithm look at what social problems<br>this is pulling out and reflecting back<br>at us<br>thanks Ben Jason yeah that's so true Ben<br>and I think um you know if people are<br>losing trust in institutions then they<br>might have a point so that's the first<br>place to start isn't it<br>um and you know I look at<br>um I was at another conference this year<br>about or last year about uh social media<br>and what to do about it and the general<br>consensus and this was from a lot of<br>countries was that banning hate speech<br>or trying to ban content on social media<br>is not the right way to go about it you<br>know first of all just deal with the<br>basics authenticate users you know if<br>you look at Banks Banks can't just take<br>sackfuls of money from Anonymous people<br>they have to confirm that you're a real<br>person so you know there's a great<br>phrase of freedom of speech but not for<br>bots so you can ban the bots off social<br>media by authenticating real people and<br>then you can tweet anonymously but you<br>have to be a real person initially right<br>um the second one is is confirming age<br>so you can do that by authenticating<br>real people um and then content<br>moderation can happen I know Pinterest<br>and YouTube do it really effectively<br>that when something goes viral I think<br>it Ben will correct me but it's<br>something like more than 300 shares or<br>something like that<br>um then that's they go oh something's<br>happening here so we need a human to<br>come in and look at this content are we<br>live streaming murder here then we're<br>going to stop it right it's illegal so<br>you don't actually need hate speech<br>legislation to do that and the final<br>thing I would say on that is that again<br>you know populist movements can be a<br>force for good in New Zealand the New<br>Zealand population was way ahead of the<br>government on supporting Ukraine they<br>could see very clearly what the issues<br>were here and it took the government you<br>know a bunch of focus groups and so on<br>to work out that oh and perhaps we<br>should be doing something a bit more<br>kind of muscular here and even in the EU<br>this week I saw a poll out which said<br>that the majority of people across the<br>European Union<br>don't see this as a war in Europe they<br>see it as a war on Europe<br>so even after a year you know people are<br>supporting<br>you know a muscular response to<br>it's on you know this issue of trust and<br>ensuring that democracy is able to<br>thrive<br>I might answer a slightly different part<br>of the question<br>because one of the um one of the parts<br>of the digital environment that I think<br>is really interesting to me is that<br>um is the challenge for government and<br>regulators and policy makers<br>pooping much more Nimble and much faster<br>than they have been and I don't<br>necessarily say that to call for<br>regulation or to suggest that<br>regulations the way to approach some of<br>the issues that would say with with big<br>tech companies but<br>the development of social media<br>platforms or of the algorithms that<br>power so much of the big ticket<br>companies services<br>moves so much faster than our public<br>Victor so not just an idea everywhere<br>and Google and Facebook has made<br>um many billions of dollars by uh<br>breaking rules and moving faster than<br>the people who would enforce those<br>um so there's a real challenge for<br>government policymakers Regulators on<br>how to speed up how to be able to get to<br>progress with fast moving technology so<br>that they're not always turning up to a<br>race that's already finished by the time<br>it gets yeah<br>um and I think that is becoming more<br>pronounced not less<br>um as we've seen over the last four<br>months or so there's a current boom and<br>generative uh artificial intelligence uh<br>that's happening at the moment with chat<br>GPT and the other services that can<br>respond to the user prompts and create<br>content seemingly out of linear actually<br>I think large training databases but uh<br>technology like that is uh it's it's<br>that race that the government's already<br>tuned up late to like now all the<br>runners who have long finished were on<br>steroids as well<br>we've got one question from the floor<br>uh Adrian here I just wanted to pick up<br>on that thing Patrick because and Jesse<br>and I were talking about this before<br>which is it's pretty clear in our<br>society the you know the business and<br>economic machine of our of Our Lives the<br>social and cultural Machines of our<br>lives have been digitized over the last<br>20 or 30 years and we got used to<br>responsiveness dynamism immediacy uh<br>from that but governing in politics in<br>its broader sense has not uh digitized<br>in the same way and so we've got this<br>big deficit with our beliefs and and<br>expectations of our entire world has not<br>been matched by the process of governing<br>or delivering services to our community<br>in a material way so if we are to build<br>trusted institutions to pick up your<br>point you just made it feels to me a<br>digital revolution has to travel through<br>all of government and the way that it<br>serves the community so I wondered if<br>you could maybe comment on that<br>which doesn't mean MP's doing really<br>boring tweets and and you know making us<br>lose the will to live yeah<br>um I mean I think you're absolutely<br>right and if you look at Tick Tock I<br>mean Ben you know I I don't whether you<br>agree but I mean Tick Tock is about the<br>only place where you really hear<br>authentic working-class voices in New<br>Zealand so you know it comes with all<br>these flaws absolutely but so there's<br>some way in which<br>um<br>you're right I think it's there's kind<br>of a divide between you know people live<br>and live on social media government and<br>institutions live in another another<br>parallel universe and every now and then<br>they bore us rigid with their sound<br>bites on Twitter<br>um so yeah I I think it comes to that<br>Democratic deficit much more it's part<br>of it but it's also part of kind of<br>moving away from the so-called mingvas<br>politicians where they're so risk-averse<br>that um you know 50 shades of beige and<br>I wonder also if it's um goes back to<br>the to the era even though I'm a you<br>know<br>um supporter a member of Tony Blair's<br>Institute but Tony Blair Bill Clinton<br>the professionalism of the politician<br>um and you know somehow it kind of<br>rubbed sandpapered off some of the moral<br>Crusade of politics and the kind of<br>rough edges and I think there's a<br>craving for kind of authenticity which<br>um those politicians that can do that<br>whether on social media or or just you<br>know in forums like this or out in the<br>community that that they will succeed<br>thanks Josie and I'm sorry uh we have<br>run into time here we've got the<br>mandatory policy panel waiting in the<br>sidelines ready to come through so what<br>I'm going to do is is thank the policy<br>the panelists very much but also<br>acknowledge that some of the points for<br>example you raised Al uh we've got a<br>session on China coming up so hopefully<br>you'll be able to stick around for that<br>session as well because as we've seen<br>these these panels are often linking and<br>interweaving with great issues that are<br>going to emerge in subsequent patterns<br>as well maybe I'll I'll end with Josie's<br>point you know polite people don't<br>change the world I hope that we are<br>polite in this forum but very much the<br>aim is to promote rigorous discussion<br>even where we don't agree so hopefully<br>we can be reasonably polite about it but<br>naughty kind but naughty okay maybe<br>that'll be our catchphrase and Matt what<br>do you think well thank you very much<br>again to our four panelists including uh<br>Patrick for making those last minute<br>contingency plans been from zooming in<br>in Britain and our two that were able to<br>hi hey how are you quick<br>nice to see you<br>but<br>well done<br>thank you<br>and ahead you might want to come round<br>hi Cameron sorry we didn't get a chance<br>for a pre-panel meeting but you know the<br>deal five minutes at the beginning for<br>no worries no worries<br>well thank you um<br>thanks very much<br>um we had the keynote presentation from<br>Adrian Orr this morning we've had a<br>little bit of a break from macro policy<br>although they were Fair it was a fairly<br>heavy thinking break from macro policy<br>but we're going back to the relative<br>lightness in a way of macro policy now<br>monetary policy<br>um and uh<br>but at times it doesn't feel that light<br>at the moment in New Zealand does it you<br>know with inflation rearing its head in<br>ways that we haven't seen for a few uh<br>decades monetary policy is suddenly<br>seeming particularly relevant to many<br>people's lives including those of us<br>with mortgages at the moment so you know<br>our session does follow on very very<br>well from Adrian Orr's keynote as well<br>as a workshop on monetary policy that we<br>hosted here at waikato management school<br>on Wednesday afternoon so some of those<br>threads may also come up in in our panel<br>discussions I'd like to introduce our<br>panelists thank them very much for<br>joining us our first panelist has<br>already been mentioned by his boss this<br>morning Paul Conway is the chief<br>Economist of The Reserve Bank of New<br>Zealand we've then got Cameron bagri who<br>is the managing director and chief<br>Economist at Bagley economics Christina<br>lung is the principal Economist at New<br>Zealand Institute of economic research<br>nzir many of us know it it has and<br>finally another of my colleagues<br>Professor Frank scrimger from economics<br>at waikato management School<br>and with that we'll pass straight to you<br>please Paul five minutes info remarks<br>great conference so far I've been really<br>enjoying it even though the material<br>we're dealing with is uh we have many<br>issues in front of us<br>um so yeah I'm going to speak five<br>minutes on monetary policy we've already<br>heard from the governor so the session<br>monetary policy uh the report card it<br>kind of makes me feel a little bit like<br>I'm back at Southland boys high school<br>in the 80s getting my report card but<br>anyway it's cool to be here and I'm<br>really looking forward to hearing what<br>the other panelists have got to say and<br>what you've all got to say about our<br>review and assessment of the formulation<br>and implementation of monetary policy<br>which is a hefty 120 page document that<br>we put out at the end of last year that<br>reviewed monetary policy over the five<br>years to October uh last year now of<br>course a report card it's all about<br>looking back and assessing how we've<br>gone assessing performance so that we<br>are better placed to move forward and<br>that's exactly what raphamp we call it<br>ref for short is all about and in fact<br>the whakato on the cover of that<br>document translates into look back and<br>reflect so you can move forward that's<br>very much what I'm interested in here<br>today the Reserve Bank we're required by<br>legislation to review our monetary<br>policy actions every five years that's a<br>new review under the new act and Rapha<br>is the first example of us fulfilling<br>that uh Mandate of course the bank has<br>done plenty of business cycle reviews<br>over the years but raphamp is far more<br>comprehensive and I do encourage you to<br>have a have a look at it it's it's a<br>document that we're quite uh proud of<br>and quite pleased with there are three<br>main sections to the report so the first<br>one provides context it covers changes<br>in the monetary policy framework that<br>occurred over the five years so this is<br>the Dual mandate the establishment of a<br>monetary policy committee etc etc<br>there's also a bit in there on economic<br>conditions going into the review period<br>so falling neutral interest rates so<br>neutral interest rates interest rates<br>that are not contractionary or<br>expansionary and they've been declining<br>uh globally and uh in New Zealand<br>heading into that review period and also<br>headline inflation in the bottom half of<br>the target band does anyone remember<br>those days they're starting to feel like<br>a long time ago now the second section<br>of this review it looks at monetary<br>policy in real time so a big focus on<br>the data that's actually in front of the<br>monetary policy committee as decisions<br>are being made for me involved in the<br>writing of it it really brought back<br>memories of the the health and economic<br>emergency that we were all living<br>through at that time it was a pretty<br>scary period and a very fast-moving<br>environment for all of us monetary<br>policy makers included over that time I<br>just want to say you know Bank staff and<br>many other people across the public<br>sector we're working super hard out<br>incredibly hard and some people are<br>still recovering from that period now we<br>draw lessons from this real-time review<br>of monetary policy I'm just going to<br>tick through some of those first you<br>know fiscal and monetary actions averted<br>worst case scenarios so economic<br>Armageddon which was widely kind of<br>predict projected or forecasted at the<br>time at the time was avoided you know<br>economic growth it's been extremely<br>volatile but it's actually been<br>relatively strong over the pandemic a<br>little too strong as it happens another<br>lesson from that period is that a clear<br>understanding of fiscal policy is<br>critical for getting monetary policy<br>right so in 2020 new fiscal policy rules<br>were being designed and rolled out at<br>PACE and monetary policy had to be<br>across those so this is about a high<br>trust environment across Treasury and<br>The Reserve Bank which I think we've<br>largely got and also a good<br>understanding across number one and<br>number two the Terrace of course without<br>compromising operational Independence<br>and not sort of conflating the roles of<br>monetary and fiscal policy another<br>lesson from this part of the report is<br>that additional monetary policy tools<br>amp tools so the LSAT program in<br>particular worked extremely well in<br>correcting Financial dysfunction at this<br>time that was incredibly important then<br>it would have been an economic an even<br>bigger economic disaster if our debt<br>markets had seized up preventing<br>governments and corporates from<br>borrowing another lesson from this<br>section of the paper is as the governor<br>alluded to this or spoke about this<br>morning is that monetary policy could<br>have been tightened earlier in 2021 in<br>which case we'd be dealing with a bit<br>less inflationary pressures now<br>now the third section of the report it<br>takes a step back and it looks at the<br>conduct of monetary policy over the<br>five-year period as a whole this<br>includes an initial assessment of the<br>broader effects of aemp tools and I say<br>initial because that story around QE<br>around quantitative easing it has a long<br>way to run and it's going to be the<br>subject of a great deal of scholarly<br>attention uh over coming years and<br>decades now again we draw a number of<br>important lessons from this part of the<br>paper I'm not going to go through them<br>all but just for example amp tools were<br>successful in providing monetary<br>stimulus so our best estimates are that<br>alsaps<br>lowered longer term interest rates to<br>the tune of 50 to 100 basis points and<br>also the funding for lending program the<br>flip also lowered interest rates by 20<br>basis points or more but it could have<br>been designed with more flexibility such<br>as an early termination clause and by<br>lowering interest rates amp tools<br>resulted in higher than otherwise<br>economic activity and inflation so they<br>were stimulatory but it's hard to<br>quantify the net economic benefits of<br>these tools whereas the mark to Market<br>costs or the accounting costs of holding<br>government bonds is straightforward to<br>measure and we publish it monthly in the<br>interest of transparency now let me<br>finish just by saying that that Lessons<br>Learned are only useful to the extent<br>that they lead to Future improvements in<br>monetary policy making looking back so<br>that we can move forward so we highlight<br>nine areas for improvement in rafimp<br>I'll summarize these<br>develop broader insights into the<br>impacts of Supply shocks on inflation so<br>this is get a better understanding of<br>the economic environment that monetary<br>policy is likely to be operating in in<br>future develop new sources of data for<br>economic monitoring as Dr Graham Scott<br>noted yesterday there's a data<br>Revolution going on and we need to be<br>right into that especially given that<br>our official data can be lagged and a<br>bit patchy develop better measures of<br>neutral interest rates so this is about<br>you know as crucial in understanding The<br>Stance of monetary policy understand the<br>role of fiscal policy instruments in<br>managing economic shocks<br>um refine our measures of Maximum<br>sustainable employment so MSE we did a<br>survey it's not particularly well<br>understood so we need to improve that<br>and we need to communicate that better<br>use lsaps to mitigate Financial Market<br>dysfunction they work in that space but<br>be cautious about providing forward<br>guidance in uncertain times things can<br>change quickly almost by definition and<br>maintain the OCR as a preferred tool for<br>setting monetary policy but maintain<br>operational Readiness across amp tools<br>again as the governor mentioned this<br>morning we are looking or we are<br>building a research agenda around these<br>improvements uh which will determine<br>what we are working on over the next few<br>years and again as Adrian made clear<br>this morning we want to partner with the<br>academic Community uh anyone really that<br>can help with that both domestically and<br>internationally so I'm planning on<br>visiting all the universities in our<br>country over the next few months<br>speaking with staff and students and<br>putting that research agenda in front of<br>them and looking for collaboration<br>opportunities we're going to get macro<br>conferences back up and running<br>sponsored by The Reserve banker and<br>partners we're going to get<br>International Economist back visiting<br>New Zealand to give us their insights<br>and Reserve Bank staff are going to get<br>back to relevant International and<br>domestic conferences to present our work<br>and get feedback so in short and just to<br>finish we are back in business and look<br>forward to engaging with you all as we<br>move forward and let's get on with it<br>because you know as we've heard over the<br>last day and a bit we have some massive<br>challenges in front of us navigating<br>Heavy Seas indeed thank you<br>thank you very much Paul Cameron<br>uh where do I start<br>there was an article I read a couple of<br>weeks ago in a newspaper the journalist<br>will remain nameless but the person<br>thought that inflation the cost of<br>living would not be the key election<br>issue of 2023.<br>in the past 48 Hours we've received the<br>ipsos issues monitor<br>and guess what inflation the cost of<br>living is the key issue and it's the key<br>issue by an absolute country mile<br>65 percent of new zealanders put<br>inflation as a top three issue the next<br>most important issues is second Equal<br>Housing at 33 and crime Law and Order at<br>33 percent<br>rather frightening education is number<br>11 on the list and people more concerned<br>about the cost of filling up their car<br>with petrol and the standard of our<br>education system I thought I'd make four<br>or five<br>sort of broad points look number one if<br>you look at the thrust of what the<br>reserve being stunned over the past five<br>years and the conclusions of the review<br>they broadly got it right<br>that we really know where we were going<br>the answer was hell no you know so you<br>had to go and you had to go big and if<br>there's question marks that I think need<br>to be asked they're around<br>won the funding for lending program<br>and I just saw ASB expanded their<br>margins by 33 basis points in their last<br>Financial results which is one hell of<br>an expansion and two the enthusiasm for<br>negative interest rates from the rbnz<br>relative to a close peer such as the RBA<br>but that's it the other the broad thrust<br>and the recommendations that came out in<br>the review looked pretty Rock Solid our<br>point to avian talked about trade-offs<br>and we are going to head in the next two<br>years into an awkward period where those<br>trade-offs are going to come to bear and<br>the reserve banks predicting the dreaded<br>recession I like to call it a reset<br>because that's a little more optimistic<br>and less pessimistic but still<br>highlights challenges<br>at the same time inflation is still<br>going to be up around six percent<br>now that sort of leads me into point<br>three as we get into<br>these trade-offs<br>one of the things that you know I look<br>back at the past few years that I'm not<br>sure<br>The Reserve Bank included it<br>sufficiently within their discussions<br>and it's it's difficult yeah because<br>it's not part of the remit it's not part<br>of the Playbook etc etc but it's the<br>whole concept of your Social license<br>yeah and doing your job<br>you've still got to have Society on<br>board<br>and one of the things that worries me<br>globally at the moment is that as the<br>economic costs of containing inflation<br>come to beer<br>I a negative growth falling house prices<br>and unemployment going to I think you're<br>5.7 something like that<br>yeah that's an awful lot more people on<br>the job Seeker benefit and there's going<br>to be social consequences of that and I<br>think there's going to be pushback<br>yeah so the the path of least regret<br>might have been appropriate but there<br>was a risk<br>that that could create challenges on the<br>other side as Society I think is going<br>to start to point the finger<br>and I'm trying to think about how that<br>is going to get shaped the second point<br>or the second question I've got is one<br>that Central Bankers probably don't want<br>to talk about but do we have the right<br>inflation Target<br>there's one to three percent the right<br>number<br>yeah we we now live in a world of<br>repeating supply shops we're seeing big<br>structural changes across the labor<br>market around the globe<br>I suspect globally there is going to be<br>the temptation as the economic costs are<br>containing inflation increase<br>people are going to want to<br>perhaps move the goal posts uh the third<br>point and Adrian brought it up was that<br>about the importance of credit meet<br>intermediation this is what we call the<br>credit channel of monetary policy which<br>is a fancy way of to get in the banking<br>system right<br>we're going to not going to make a<br>prosperous more affluent New Zealand by<br>selling more expensive houses to each<br>other<br>and there's some deep rooted structural<br>questions that need ask about the<br>process of financial intermediation<br>across New Zealand and Paul I see you<br>spoke up the other day about supporting<br>the Commerce Commission in regard to<br>driving more competitive pressure good<br>on you for for taking that view the<br>final question I have is this<br>interaction between monetary policy and<br>fiscal policy<br>yeah we know what fiscal policy<br>technically needs to do the Reserve Bank<br>needs mates well<br>the government of the day<br>is facing the reality of 30 years of<br>under investment across critical<br>infrastructure in New Zealand<br>so that's the long game addressing those<br>infrastructure needs through probably<br>one of the biggest investment booms<br>we're ever going to see versus the near<br>Team Challenge of tightening the belt<br>and monetary policy and fiscal policy<br>are going to go head-to-head uh 0.4<br>final one just some small suggestions in<br>regard to fine-tuning<br>and some examples of fine tuning I think<br>a biggest belief why New Zealand does<br>not have a monthly CPI number the<br>biggest belief why we actually don't<br>know what the migration figures are in<br>New Zealand because we don't know until<br>people don't come back in 12 months so<br>at the moment it's pure guesswork and<br>the final thing is that you know and<br>Paul talked about this we need a better<br>understanding of fiscal policy<br>you know fiscal policy is a big game in<br>town for the next 10 years and I don't<br>see an awful lot of economic analysis<br>commentary on fiscal policy I see an<br>awful lot of commentary on monetary<br>policy thank you<br>thanks Cameron Christina<br>Ross thanks for having me here so um<br>when I was asked to talk about the in<br>five minutes<br>um what's been going on over the past<br>five years it really was like well<br>clearly we've been through some pretty<br>unprecedented um times with the covert<br>pandemic obviously and also more<br>recently the floods and the cycling<br>Gabriel now in terms of thinking about<br>what that all means for monetary policy<br>certainly from the supply side it's<br>created a lot of changes prior to the<br>pandemic we've had prices but be I<br>always in economics we always talk about<br>it always comes back to supply and<br>demand and previously in normal times<br>what you would have is when there's been<br>um a sharp increase in prices naturally<br>that's an indication for more resources<br>to be allocated to that area in which<br>case then the increase in Supply would<br>lead to an easing in inflation from that<br>but with the pandemic and the physical<br>constraints preventing the those that<br>mobility of resources from happening in<br>that adjustment what that boiled down to<br>was very high inflation and then of<br>course added on top of that was that um<br>unprecedented stimulus which stimulated<br>demand which then created that perfect<br>storm for inflation now in terms of what<br>it means clearly in hindsight<br>um monetary policy was too loose for too<br>long but that's in very uncertain times<br>that's to be expected that for the<br>policy makers we were in times where we<br>a lot of decisions had to be made<br>quickly and that was what resulted also<br>looking at our nzie our quarterly server<br>business opinion it really highlights<br>all the hitwinds that were facing the<br>economy even prior to the extreme<br>weather events that we've had business<br>confidence at Rick lows with labor<br>shortages being the main concern for<br>many of the businesses so<br>certainly there were a lot of these um<br>things that were already challenging for<br>the New Zealand economy now on top of<br>that Fuller Reserve Bank a lot of the<br>challenges in that lagged transmission<br>of monetary policy which uh Governor or<br>commented on earlier this morning now<br>um the former U.S treasury secretary<br>Larry Summers he uses this analogy and I<br>think it's a great analogy and I wish I<br>came up with it of monetary policy being<br>like a wonky Hotel shower so here you<br>are in the shower trying to crank up the<br>Heat and the hot water is yet to come<br>through so you're just cranking up the<br>heat wanting that um and then finally<br>when it all arrives you get scolded now<br>for economies such as the US and New<br>Zealand we're a large proportion of<br>Mortgage Debt is on fixed term mortgage<br>rates this lag transmission of monetary<br>policy is particularly relevant because<br>you're having these um over a year on<br>from when the Reserve Bank first started<br>increasing the OCR we're yet to fully<br>feel the impact of that across many of<br>the borrowers over the coming year we're<br>going to have half of mortgages due for<br>repricing so many of these households<br>will be moving from fixed term mortgage<br>rates of two to three percent onto<br>something significantly higher of over<br>six to seven percent so that will mean a<br>significant increase in mortgage<br>repayments for many of these households<br>and we're all likely to see an<br>adjustment in spending as a result of<br>those mortgage payments crowding out<br>areas of discretionary spending now<br>um Adrian talked about earlier this<br>morning talked about the Central Bank<br>needing to be reactive to the<br>circumstances and certainly that's true<br>for a lot of the circumstances that are<br>beyond the central banks control the<br>unforeseen circumstances that we've seen<br>with the pandemic uh the extreme weather<br>events but there is also um that need to<br>be recognizing that in terms of the<br>monetary policy and the lag transmission<br>of that what that should mean in terms<br>of inflation pressures later on and<br>being mindful of the risk of over<br>correction on the way up as well as on<br>the way down now to be clear High<br>inflation is very damaging for the<br>economy and certainly from coming here<br>as a as an immigrant in the 1990 during<br>that time when inflation was very high<br>and having seen my parents with savings<br>and worrying about the purchasing power<br>of those savings being eroded away over<br>the years um certainly I can see the<br>damaging impact that high inflation has<br>on well-being but um also being and also<br>being mindful of the fact that there's<br>distributional impacts are from loose<br>monetary policy as well so Adrian<br>earlier this morning talked about that<br>new dimension that well-being Dimension<br>and certainly when we've seen over the<br>period when interest rates were very uh<br>monetary policy was very loose for a<br>long time we saw that most of that um<br>impact was for people really who had the<br>equity to make use of those low<br>borrowing costs for those that didn't<br>have that Equity um having the asset<br>prices keep increasing away and<br>um always<br>um that I struggle to catch up with that<br>rise and uh interest uh house prices in<br>order to be able to get into the housing<br>market certainly you can really see the<br>distributional impact that monetary<br>policy can have on across the economy so<br>those would be the key things I would um<br>take in terms of what we've seen even uh<br>both prior to the pandemic and then also<br>and more recently as we now adjust to a<br>new normal<br>thank you for the opportunity to share<br>this panel with my StreetWise colleagues<br>it's great to be here um<br>I'll cut to the chase<br>score five out of 10.<br>um it's not a school for effort<br>it's a score for<br>outcomes and it recognizes that there's<br>a lot of factors in play which influence<br>the outcomes Shocks come along which<br>make it a challenging job I'm not too<br>sure many of us would like to take up<br>the Governor's role<br>um and also there's all the challenges<br>imposed by Her Majesty's government on<br>the fiscal side which make it all the<br>um<br>it's a pass mark<br>but it's a bit like the Chiefs drawing<br>with the hurricanes<br>not very satisfying<br>and it's not even against it's not even<br>a draw with the Crusaders<br>um<br>but we have this evaluation and the<br>question is you know are we thinking<br>about for the five years or are we<br>thinking about their performance at<br>particularly important times where<br>decisive decisions<br>were made or are we thinking about<br>um<br>the state of the bank now you know we've<br>come through<br>where are we at are we ready for the<br>future<br>um<br>and the question is should it be the<br>Reserve Bank reporting on itself anyway<br>or should it be other people undertaking<br>a review of the bank and perhaps the<br>bank might be able to do quite a good<br>job of reviewing the fiscal policies<br>that they had to work with<br>so anyway I I would like to put on the<br>table three reasons for my<br>my passing grade which gives room for<br>improvement<br>first of all to me there's been a severe<br>loss of confidence in the bank amongst<br>the academic community in which I live<br>in amongst the borrowing community in<br>which I live<br>you know I may have a bad memory but<br>my memory is my colleagues and peers and<br>business associates had greater<br>confidence in the institution than they<br>do today<br>was that well I think many perceived the<br>bank as being like a learner driver over<br>the last few years<br>over correcting<br>um perhaps even destabilizing the<br>economy rather than helping this<br>move to Greater balance<br>um<br>a reluctance of the bank to<br>uh<br>publicly acknowledge when it got things<br>wrong<br>and so um<br>in in choosing uh very<br>major analogies to say we avoided<br>Armageddon well<br>we didn't avoid a lot of Lissa<br>so that's that's the first concern is is<br>the perceptions there's the rebuilding<br>challenge there the second I I say<br>has there been sufficient preparation<br>for the future we had uh the<br>conversation about digital currencies<br>this morning really helpful but I think<br>there's been a lot happening around the<br>world I don't think we're as far forward<br>as we should be and ready for Central<br>Bank initiatives and for Central Bank<br>oversight the future is coming fast<br>and secondly I think I think as part of<br>that<br>future building I don't think we've got<br>our human capital right our our<br>academic capability and I'm I was really<br>excited to hear uh Paul's comments about<br>the potential for greater engagement by<br>the bank with the the thinking community<br>and<br>a uh<br>suggest to you that over the last five<br>years the banks breadth of interests has<br>increased but its depth of capability<br>has uh diminished and and so we we<br>haven't got the the mix optimal there<br>and thirdly I want to jump outside of<br>the monetary policy remit for a while<br>and then talk about fiduciary oversight<br>and Prudential regulation<br>um there's been a lot done in the last<br>uh few years but I suggest to you that<br>um<br>there's been a trend towards complexity<br>a lot of stuff happening and<br>um in that some of the most important<br>stuff hasn't been<br>occurring and I think it hasn't been<br>helped by the whole basal process I I I<br>think you know you you get Auditors and<br>technocrats into certain kind of stuff<br>they they get locked into the detail and<br>they sometimes miss the most important<br>stuff which is essential for ensuring<br>our financial security so<br>Let's uh look forward to a higher score<br>next time around thank you<br>thanks uh Frank and I noticed that Paul<br>looked like he like he might like to ask<br>for a grade reconsideration from uh from<br>the current head of our school of<br>accounting but I did notice him nodding<br>his head in appreciation of some of the<br>comments that that were made<br>um I guess you know when while I was<br>listening to these panelists and the<br>insights that they were bringing it just<br>kept on reminding me that economics one<br>of our strengths and weaknesses of a<br>discipline is that we use models we make<br>assumptions and that's we're not just a<br>pure descriptive science but the way<br>that you can look forward is to is to<br>try to distill what's interesting and<br>what's important about a situation about<br>a problem and use that as a lens to try<br>to take us forward but of course our<br>panelists reminded us of a lot of the<br>problems with this we've got multiple<br>targets<br>and they threw in fiscal policy as well<br>as multiple monetary policy targets that<br>may be sometimes conflicting so we've<br>got multiple targets we've got other<br>things in the economy to to worry about<br>as well including what the fiscal policy<br>guys are doing Christina reminded us<br>about those lags and of course these are<br>the the bane of many macro economists um<br>lives that you know you might change<br>something in macro policy but you've got<br>12 18 months time period before it<br>really kicks in so I guess the first<br>question I'd like to start with and if<br>you've got questions from the floor<br>please do raise your hand so we get the<br>mic to while they're thinking about this<br>one but the first question I'd like to<br>address the panelists is on this issue<br>of multiple targets in a very Dynamic<br>difficult environment<br>um<br>it's all very well to do ex post<br>assessment and we understand the<br>difficulty of forecasting and also it<br>reminded me of that old joke that you<br>know the economists are there to make<br>the weather forecasters look good<br>um but I'd like you your insights into<br>these<br>conflicting sometimes policy targets<br>have we got too many targets<br>um have we got the right targets how do<br>we manage these multiple targets Paul do<br>you want to start with that one<br>weather forecasters have much better<br>data than economists what I would give<br>for continuous uh real-time data on<br>where the economy is at it would be<br>incredibly useful and as I said in my<br>comments you know I think we can go some<br>way towards that and that's part of our<br>agenda going forward in terms of<br>multiple targets I think you know the<br>governor addressed this issue uh this<br>morning<br>personally I am indifferent about<br>whether we have maximum sustainable<br>employment in our remit it's actually in<br>the legislation so to get rid of it<br>would involve reopening the the ACT<br>um you know which is the government can<br>obviously do that and the reason I'm<br>indifferent about it is that um you know<br>often like more often than not our<br>inflation inflation and what's happening<br>in the labor market are correlated so<br>it's reasonably rare for us to have a<br>conflict there of course you know with<br>Supply shocks<br>um it's absolutely possible that we have<br>a conflict there and I think we need a<br>clear sort of guidance on what we<br>prioritize in that uh situation and<br>we're actually doing a remit review at<br>the moment we'll be giving advice to the<br>Minister of Finance uh in April that<br>does address<br>um some of these things and the last<br>thing I'll say is you know as Adrian<br>said this stuff is it's hard<br>um getting across<br>um you know just even in the monetary<br>policy space and then you go more<br>broadly across the bank and financial<br>stability uh and inclusion the other<br>sort of objectives we've been given and<br>then you sort of go broader again across<br>the public sector the regulatory system<br>what's happening uh in the fiscal space<br>but I think the challenges that we're<br>facing at the moment require all those<br>policy areas to be uh lined up I'm sort<br>of you know I'm aware you know what<br>Graham Dr Graham Scott said yesterday<br>about you know sometimes it's just good<br>to give someone a job and go away and do<br>that and you know I think that's true<br>but I think there's in some cases but I<br>think a lot of the issues we're facing<br>into require a whole of government<br>approach<br>Cameron did you want to make any<br>comments on this issue of targets<br>well<br>presumably<br>yeah if we do get that Clash<br>then we are going to get that clash<br>between the employment<br>and the inflation objective<br>the inflation ejector becomes sacrosanct<br>which that's the one that you go after<br>and I guess the bigger issue to me is<br>once again how does that Clash play out<br>because I think it's coming<br>yeah the reality is that<br>central banks are inflation fighting for<br>the past 30 years has had a whole lot of<br>Dynamics and central banks favor whether<br>you look at globalization demographics<br>technology that there's a big list<br>if you look at what they're facing<br>nowadays whether it be the world that is<br>onshoring<br>there's systems that are recovering just<br>in case as opposed to just in time big<br>shift in labor market rebalancing back<br>towards the employees versus employers<br>our demographics people are starting to<br>spend as opposed to saves that's eating<br>into the savings clock<br>yeah the way central banks or the pain<br>that central banks need to dish out now<br>to get the inflationary Thief back in<br>jail is going to be higher<br>and that's where I'm looking at how does<br>this pan out within a social sense<br>and I don't have answers to that at the<br>moment but it's one of my big concerns<br>thanks Cameron<br>my um concern is this morning I thought<br>the governor did a good job of<br>explaining the complexity that they face<br>but the very real risk is is that in<br>thinking about this complexity we create<br>confusion and it seems to me weird I<br>hear talk about multiple objective<br>functions I start to get really worried<br>you know what is the objective function<br>and what are the arguments in that<br>objective function and and how do we<br>bring these uh different issues together<br>in an appropriate manner giving<br>the right weight to this issue in a<br>different way to this other issue in a<br>different place so so I think<br>if we can reduce the confusion we<br>enhance the trust and we bring the best<br>out of our advisors and and others<br>yeah so all policy as we discussed<br>earlier this morning all policy<br>interventions will have trade-offs so<br>it's a matter of whether we make those<br>are they implicit or we make them<br>explicit<br>um I agree that in terms of priority uh<br>inflation from a credibility perspective<br>uh should be the priority into we making<br>policy<br>um and then it's all um it's then more<br>about taking into consideration what are<br>the side effects if you like from um<br>um you're just a respond to Frank like I<br>I take your caution uh that if we get<br>too sort of absorbed in this in this<br>world of multiple objectives with their<br>own set of trade-offs you know the<br>danger is that we end up with with mush<br>kind of thing so I think there is an<br>argument for saying we need to be very<br>clear uh on on certain things and I take<br>camps Point as well you know that<br>inflation should have uh Primacy when we<br>get into a situation of trade-offs we've<br>got more coming uh on that with our<br>remit review but I also say you know the<br>world is incredibly complex and in a<br>sense<br>um this challenge for policy makers just<br>reflects the world that we're operating<br>in and the world is getting more and<br>more complex so in a way we can't get<br>away from it but I do you know fully<br>take the point we need to understand<br>these which is now that that's our call<br>like can we work with academics like you<br>know we've got a lot of work to figure<br>this stuff out uh and you know we can go<br>further with it together<br>one of the interesting things in the<br>last<br>six to 12 months has been the<br>consistency and the messaging coming out<br>of the U.S federal reserve which is the<br>most powerful Central Bank around the<br>guibes so you need to listen yeah<br>they've been on script and it's been a<br>really consistent message and financial<br>markets didn't want to buy into that<br>script at the end of last year earlier<br>this year pushing the pivot interest<br>rates are coming back down well markets<br>in our airing back towards the fed's<br>view of the world you know we've got a<br>tough job ahead and rates might need to<br>be higher for longer so that the message<br>is starting to get through but all fed<br>members have been singing from the same<br>hitting book it's been great to see<br>thanks can we get a mic to this table<br>thank you very much I I<br>was actually quite pleased to hear Frank<br>of the reserve Banker score of five out<br>of ten because that's about what I would<br>give them and I thought I was going to<br>be the extreme one here<br>um The Reserve Bank has admitted they<br>were a bit slow in moving away from<br>their low easing I think the biggest<br>problem was how far they went into that<br>low eating and they they don't seem to<br>take any responsibility for that uh Paul<br>has explained it that they avoided<br>economic Armageddon well you can't prove<br>that either way<br>something that is unprovable<br>um<br>Adrian Orr this morning said you've<br>always got to be conscious of the<br>trade-offs that your tools are limited<br>and there are long legs well I think you<br>forgot about all of those during that<br>period the trade-off was completely<br>forgotten you focused entirely on growth<br>and employment and forgot about<br>inflation you you ignored the trade-offs<br>you seem to forget that your tools are<br>limited you thought you could do<br>everything and all central banks did<br>that they lost their modesty and they<br>tried to take on everything<br>and the lags<br>I went down to the Reserve Bank in<br>November 2020 and said you're building<br>up asset price pressure you increase<br>risk in the financial sector and latent<br>inflation represses they won't they you<br>couldn't see all of them but they were<br>going to come because of your settings<br>and you forgot about the lags did you<br>take any of those things into account in<br>2020 and early 2021 because it's not<br>um I I was an outsider at the time as<br>well<br>I've been in this job for about 10<br>months now which gives which gives me a<br>useful separation from actually what was<br>going on in the building uh at that time<br>I think it gives me perspective uh on<br>these challenges I think you know when I<br>get asked this question and I get asked<br>a lot I sort of say well uh cast your<br>minds back to where we were at uh at<br>that time and you know Joanna talked<br>about massive uncertainty uh during that<br>period uh the bank also took at least<br>regrets uh approach in terms of avoiding<br>uh deflation it was very focused uh on<br>doing that you know and I think with the<br>benefit of hindsight or another way of<br>putting that you know if we had if the<br>bank had perfect foresight uh at the<br>time then you know and that's exactly<br>what raphamp is about it's about looking<br>back to say well what could we have done<br>better so that we're better placed<br>um to to do it going forward you know<br>the housing market uh point is<br>interesting it sort of came up yesterday<br>as well around migration<br>um you know you need houses to house<br>migrants but you migrants to build<br>houses you know I think if we're worried<br>about inflation in like yes house prices<br>are affected by interest rates that's<br>clear on the way up and the way down<br>we're seeing that currently but if you<br>if you want to avoid uh big swings in<br>house prices uh fix the housing market<br>build more houses it's not clear to me<br>that monetary policy should in effect be<br>constrained by sub-optimal policy<br>settings uh in in the housing market<br>so yeah I I would argue that all of<br>those things you listed would have been<br>on the desk on around the table in<br>monetary policy committee meetings<br>um but you know I I totally respect the<br>view that you're putting forward yeah<br>yeah thanks for that Paul thanks for<br>linking back to some of those other<br>panels that we've had and also reminding<br>us we tend to think about demand when<br>we're thinking about inflation but of<br>course it's it's the mismatch of supply<br>and demand and longer term I guess the<br>hope is if we can expand that supply and<br>economy we don't end up with an<br>inflation problem of course Paul you've<br>got a lot of experience in this area so<br>hopefully that will start to come<br>through in in The Reserve Bank<br>um we're focusing on<br>covert right but go back 10 15 years<br>we've really had a maxim it's whatever<br>it takes<br>yeah we're just going to flood the<br>system with liquidity we did it after<br>the GFC now a certain amount was<br>required because we were in the midst of<br>the the financial crisis but the the<br>playbook for what got unlocked over<br>covert has been in play for more than a<br>decade<br>okay we've got a very popular question<br>that's come through from slido um do you<br>think New Zealand could be well served<br>by 20 or 30-year fixed sorry fixed rate<br>mortgages similar to the US and Nordic<br>lending markets<br>I'm not sure which of you would care to<br>take first go at this one<br>given the the discussion about the lags<br>and monetary policy it would make it<br>even harder to conduct monetary policy I<br>would imagine given any changes to the<br>policy cash rate itself wouldn't really<br>translate through for a long time onto<br>the broader economy<br>um so I would say from a<br>effectiveness of monetary policy I would<br>it would probably make things a lot<br>harder thanks any other comments<br>like I'll just say that uh you know we<br>talk a lot about mortgages uh as a<br>channel for monetary policy transmission<br>uh to the real economy and you know it's<br>true it's a really important part of<br>that transmission mechanism but there<br>are there are other ones as well you<br>know we've talked about uh the influence<br>on asset prices uh and of course through<br>the exchange rate and the influence that<br>that has on exports and import import<br>prices and activity in that in that part<br>of the economy so you know my sort of<br>view on this yeah I think I think for<br>some mortgages the the sort of stability<br>of being able to lock in a mortgage for<br>that length of time would be uh<br>well-being enhancing I take Christina<br>Christina's point that that would even<br>sort of lengthen those lags for part of<br>the transmission system for monetary<br>policy there are other sort of mechanism<br>or ways in which what we do with the OCR<br>transmits to the real side of the<br>economy<br>I'm not sure to be huge demand for the<br>product<br>you know the reality is that most new<br>zealanders like the attractiveness of a<br>one and a two Euro<br>and Banks like to Max their assets with<br>their liabilities<br>yeah so that's where they tend to go<br>most aggressive in regard to pricing it<br>tends to be the better value for<br>customers<br>okay<br>um do wave out if you've got questions<br>from the floor and I'll watch out and<br>get the mic to you there's one at the<br>back please if we can get a mic<br>my name is Reza<br>um<br>I am a property developer I am a startup<br>owner in the tech space and I've had<br>countless um<br>nights of without the sleeps or the past<br>year because of the you know turbulances<br>in the market<br>I'm also a lecturer of finance and<br>economics<br>at wintech and<br>um<br>so<br>um I I see a lot of cognitive biases<br>when it comes to when I look back at the<br>decision making you have this situation<br>where there is an influx of money<br>Supply money and you also have these<br>disruptions in<br>um you know the supply chain<br>which affects production so the Reserve<br>Bank<br>would know that there will be lower<br>production<br>and although it always takes this<br>passive position that things happen then<br>the Reserve Bank reacts and there's a<br>lag in the policy<br>all of a sudden when it came to covet it<br>decided that it needs to be proactive<br>and cut the rates significantly at the<br>time<br>so what did we expect really in a<br>situation where you have lower<br>production a huge supply of money well<br>of course you would have inflation right<br>and it's not something that you can say<br>this is we can look at it in retrospect<br>or on the hind side in uh yes we could<br>do things differently as an economist or<br>you know many economists they would know<br>that that would happen right<br>so um I don't really see that as an<br>acceptable thing coming from The Reserve<br>Bank<br>another thing is what is frightening me<br>at the moment<br>is that those cognitive biases like we<br>convince ourselves that the situation is<br>too complex to handle so it is okay to<br>make huge mistakes<br>um and we I believe we panicked uh at<br>the outset we sort of uh The the Reserve<br>Bank reduced the interest rates did the<br>lsap program on the other side the<br>government kept the spending and<br>spending<br>and um<br>what is is frightening now is that<br>um we we have set a one to three percent<br>inflation Target and we're hoping to<br>achieve that by the mid by mid 2024 I<br>don't see that being a realistic Target<br>and I see that it is just to be<br>convincing ourselves again that that's<br>going to happen<br>and we know that the government is going<br>to keep spending right they will spend<br>and spend they and I think at the moment<br>the real interest rates are lower than<br>inflation as they're still fueling the<br>inflation really and at the end of the<br>day I I don't see a clear path forward<br>uh with with this mindset that doesn't<br>take it seriously enough and doesn't<br>take action in time let's let's open<br>this up to the panel know we're very<br>time constrained here so if you want to<br>make any brief comments and response<br>thanks for that question yeah there's a<br>lot in that<br>um<br>like you know we of course we take it<br>seriously like I totally push back uh on<br>on that we're a very dedicated motivator<br>but I don't need to tell you uh all of<br>that you know in the covert thing you<br>know like my recollection of what<br>commentators around the place were<br>saying most of the conversation was<br>about how do we get uh interest rates uh<br>negative sort of reflecting the severity<br>of the situation that we were in at the<br>time uh and yes with the benefit of<br>hindsight you know you can uh make you<br>can make those points but um<br>I think it's you know it's really<br>important to think about what was on the<br>table uh at the time with fatality rates<br>growing exponentially uh around the<br>world it was a very dramatic time also<br>you know the stuff on fiscal policy like<br>that was a really big fiscal response<br>the wage subsidy worked incredibly well<br>uh the fiscal authorities were very good<br>at getting that out the door and into<br>people's bank accounts uh you know<br>pretty much instantaneously and and and<br>it worked<br>um so yeah I I don't really know how to<br>address your other comments apart to say<br>you know we need to as I said we need to<br>learn more about how these tools uh<br>interact uh with each other we have got<br>a coffee break coming up so maybe you<br>can explore some of those during the<br>coffee break to be fair to the reserve<br>end there's been a lot going on like<br>Ukraine<br>yeah consistent problems across you know<br>China's supply chain with their extended<br>lockdown that sort of stuff so this<br>morphed Way Beyond<br>covert which made their problems more<br>diff the challenge is more difficult<br>that said you know<br>The Omelette was overeat<br>and you know I come back to what I said<br>earlier on about the funding for lending<br>program I still struggle to get my head<br>around in regard to why a crisis<br>management tool was ever put in place<br>with the banking system that was very<br>well financed and had no problems<br>accessing cash<br>and the enthusiasm for negative interest<br>rates I don't think was coming from the<br>private sector<br>and that was coming from within the<br>Reserve Bank and The Reserve Bank<br>clicked that for touch sorry The Reserve<br>Bank of Australia to see we're not going<br>there<br>we're almost out of time but Christine<br>and Frank if you would like to make any<br>final remarks so I think it within the<br>crisis or a demanding period large<br>proportions of the population in the<br>business Community want to get behind<br>our leaders they want stability they<br>want to know what's going on<br>but the challenge within that is that<br>sometimes it can create a certain kind<br>of group think and we we don't get the<br>alternative view or the alternative view<br>is not specified very clearly<br>um and and so I think part of the<br>challenge is to build into our<br>institutional design and our processes<br>how we hear those discordant voices even<br>when they are not quite right they're<br>usually on to a genuine irritant or a<br>genuine kind of matter and the<br>challenges for us to find mechanisms to<br>hear that but hear it appropriately<br>rather than just become reactionary<br>sir Frank talks about the importance<br>of NZ of our business opinion we see<br>that over the history of the survey<br>during times of high uncertainty is when<br>we see our business confidence at very<br>low levels so that just goes to show how<br>important it is to have some clarity<br>some sort of plan so that businesses and<br>households can plan around that like<br>even if it's knowing that the Outlook is<br>going to be Grim it's not so much about<br>what's going to happen over the coming<br>years it's like being able to plan<br>around the events as much as possible so<br>that's where having that transparency<br>that was talked about earlier this<br>morning is quite important so that<br>people know what they're in for and can<br>plan around those accordingly and I'm<br>sorry I know that Paul has more he wants<br>to add in here but I'm sorry I am going<br>to have to close this session I think we<br>we are moving to a break next but you<br>know this has been a great session it's<br>lots of linkages with other sessions<br>including you know Graham Scott I'll<br>suggested whether you know the Reserve<br>Bank board is the right sort of mix and<br>there's a question come through here<br>that we didn't have time to ask but it's<br>an interesting question is it possible<br>that composition of the board with<br>limited expertise in this area is making<br>us prone to swings in um in swings in in<br>decisions that can be destabilizing so<br>there's lots and lots of room for<br>discussion I hope the discussion will be<br>ongoing during the break I'm going to<br>look to Matt now to advise us what time<br>we need to finish the coffee break<br>10 50 please we've got uh great sessions<br>coming up out of the break so please go<br>and enjoy some coffee and be back at 10<br>50. thank you very much oh sorry thank<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>can I uh I'm not sure if it's going yes<br>can I please welcome people to come back<br>in<br>um it was a apologies a short break for<br>a little bit uh squeezed this morning<br>and I know it's fantastic to have the<br>time to catch up but people welcome back<br>into the room uh we've got uh three<br>sessions remaining and they're all<br>they're some of the heaviest hitting I'm<br>a big believer in Daniel kahneman's work<br>about Peak end experience and you need<br>to end strong and so we're going now<br>into a session on Crown Maori relations<br>a co-governance but also what next for a<br>very long relationship then a session on<br>environment transitioning the navigating<br>the path to Net Zero and<br>decision on China and the West so as<br>people come back in I'll just introduce<br>the panel and then we will get into it<br>so thank you we've got a fantastic panel<br>with us here today uh first we have<br>Christopher Finlayson uh returns to his<br>career in law now but we all probably<br>know him a little better as former<br>Attorney General and minister of Treaty<br>of waitangi negotiations we have<br>parakafia McLean chair for whakati Tenga<br>or waikato CEO of the criminal cases<br>review commission and somebody who in a<br>variety of roles you'll see in the<br>biography in your book has been an<br>active participant and leader within<br>Crown Maori relations in in different<br>capacities for many years we also have<br>Jason meaker Jason is an associate<br>professor of Maori business here at Taro<br>Papa waikato management school and<br>really a leading thinker on the<br>intersection between tiamari and the<br>commercial and business world and and a<br>leader in the research space for that as<br>well so very much looking forward to<br>this question I'll ask each of you to<br>make some opening comments three to five<br>minutes otherwise that that cough that<br>conspicuous cough will be your warning<br>and then we'll open up to questions<br>please from the floor and on slido and<br>let's get into it so I might ask for you<br>um oh on on here I'll come down<br>um Christopher please you're up there<br>and<br>and as I acknowledge you intellectual<br>and Civic leaders what I've said also as<br>I acknowledge those who have passed and<br>I particularly want to mention two of my<br>former colleagues Chester boroughs whom<br>we buried yesterday<br>with the the love the aroha of Nati<br>ruanui and naruahine and also one of my<br>predecessors as attorney general Paul<br>East who died after a very long and<br>courageous struggle with Parkinson's and<br>I know Jim bulges here and he'd want me<br>to say that as well can I also<br>acknowledge tainui the great ewe not<br>only of waikato as some people think but<br>also all the way through to Tamaki and<br>of course one of the Kings used to have<br>his Summer Palace on the grounds of what<br>is now the Auckland War Memorial Museum<br>and there are some interesting<br>discussions that will go on about<br>boundaries as between Nadi fatua and<br>waikato tainui and I very much look<br>forward to observing those having been<br>the minister dealing with them for many<br>years<br>can I tell you a story a couple of weeks<br>ago<br>the wife of the United States Ambassador<br>here asked me a question she said you<br>know the stuff about co-governance are<br>you talking about treaty-based<br>Partnerships<br>and I said well yes I am and she said<br>I'll send you some material and she sent<br>me some stuff about<br>an area of 1.3 million acres in southern<br>Utah called the beers ears Monument<br>and it was set aside by President Obama<br>the great toxic narcissist of Mar-A-Lago<br>reduced it to about five acres and then<br>President Biden extended it back out to<br>1.3 million acres and it is co-managed<br>by the United States Bureau of Land<br>Management and five First Nations groups<br>including the Navajo and the Pueblo<br>and it's one of a number of examples in<br>the United States of treaty-based<br>co-management and that's what we're<br>talking about or I have to I'm talking<br>about and I worked with Stephen Joyce<br>and others on when I was in government<br>from 2008 to 2017.<br>uh now that he's passed away I can<br>probably blame Michael Cullen for<br>introducing the term co-governance which<br>has developed a life of its own because<br>some people are conflating co-governance<br>and co-government but that's not what<br>it's about<br>it was about treaty-based<br>co-management of Natural Resources<br>normally reached but not always through<br>treaty settlements and the first one I<br>had to deal with was over the Great<br>waikato River after I became the<br>minister and I worked with te Arawa and<br>tufaritoa and the and natimaniapoto to<br>bring the waipar into that Arrangement<br>and that has been very successful and I<br>acknowledge the late John Luxton who<br>worked with Tucker Morgan on that as<br>co-chairs and there have been other<br>examples that I introduced when I was a<br>minister for Treaty of waitangi<br>negotiations so that's the Genesis of<br>treaty-based co-management expunge<br>co-governance from your Lexicon because<br>it's confusing and mischievous talk<br>about treaty-based co-management of<br>natural resources and there you have<br>something which I believe is extremely<br>positive<br>and good for the country<br>and there's nothing new Under the Sun so<br>I'll leave it there I'm tempted to say<br>if you want further material on the<br>background you should<br>this sounds awfully arrogant but I'll<br>say it anyway go to my book<br>and the other thing you may do if you<br>can't be bothered helping me with<br>royalties is go to The Listener of a<br>couple of weeks ago where there is an<br>article by me on that now there's going<br>to be debate about article 3 and<br>co-governance maybe we could explore<br>and look I just had to bring<br>Christopher's book along<br>given we were talking about this very<br>important<br>but really it is an honor to be here<br>alongside both Christopher and um<br>uh Jason today this is a Culpepper that<br>is dear to my heart Crown Mighty<br>relations and<br>um like Christopher I'm going to share<br>with you a personal story I've also<br>brought along notes because my day roll<br>is as a CEO of a crown entity and given<br>the events of the week I need to be very<br>careful about what I say given the media<br>here and others as well so look it is a<br>privilege I've had the privilege of<br>almost 12 years being in a leadership<br>role with waikato's autonary and so I'm<br>going to share some of the insights and<br>experiences that I've had before I talk<br>about the co-governance co-managements<br>arrangements however from the waikato<br>river settlement it is really important<br>first to acknowledge that 28 years ago<br>in 1995 through the leadership of the<br>and we have in the presence the prime<br>minister at that time tar surgeon Bulger<br>here who signed our ropatu land<br>settlement<br>I was in the states at that time but my<br>parents were present at turangaway Marae<br>and if you imagine in those days we<br>didn't have the opportunity your ability<br>to text to Instagram or to Facebook or<br>Tick Tock uh real-time action instead my<br>mother wrote a beautiful letter<br>describing in detail that day<br>and described what really resonated with<br>me was the reason why here and Dad<br>supported the Mahi at that time of the<br>late Sir Robert mahuta and the<br>settlement and that was despite<br>the her cousin the very ferocious and<br>formidable<br>um Eva Rickard and her whanau protesting<br>outside tudong Huawei that day and what<br>she said in her letter to me was that<br>to<br>really have the opportunity to determine<br>for ourselves our future<br>and so she was very much about<br>supporting and building the prosperity<br>of our ewe<br>um I have that little store and whenever<br>I read it I'm very emotional about it I<br>was emotional at the time because I<br>wasn't back here in aotearoa New Zealand<br>and I'm emotional about it now because<br>both my parents have now passed on and<br>it is one of the reasons I guess one of<br>the drivers for me personally as to why<br>I involve myself in the day-to-day lives<br>in the leadership of our ewe there are<br>two other points that I wanted to make<br>about that particular settlement that<br>opatu settlement the first is around the<br>statement that or the our narrative from<br>waikato<br>as land was taken at that time so it<br>should be returned the other point<br>within the Preamble of that act and that<br>settlement refers to this being a<br>process of healing and the new age of<br>and that's a nice segue into our second<br>historical settlement and that of the<br>waikato river claim and Christopher is<br>correct when he draws on and the<br>references of co-management within our<br>settlement however from an ewe<br>perspective from a waikato perspective<br>what is also is a what is also important<br>uh some of the kupu and the references<br>to te Mana or tawa The Prestige<br>of the river the river is a tupuna we<br>consider here to be our ancestor<br>heide which is referencing The Authority<br>not just waikato but the other River ewe<br>have in terms of the management and<br>access to the river and her resources<br>and the final point is really teture<br>faimana which is a reference to the<br>vision and strategy of our settlement<br>which is all about<br>uh restoring and protecting the health<br>and well-being of the waikato river for<br>future generations and that is something<br>that is an interest to many others not<br>just to the ewe so when I was appointed<br>the CEO of waikato's autonomy in 2010<br>one of my accountabilities was to work<br>with a diverse group of organizations<br>central government local authorities<br>many other stakeholder and interest<br>groups to how do we give effect to that<br>vision and strategy and it's embodied<br>very much in the waikato river Authority<br>that Christopher has mentioned which was<br>co-chaired at the Time by The Honorable<br>John Luxton and tuku Morgan my fellow<br>tribal leader<br>recently I read a news Hub seat set the<br>table series around co-governance and<br>they describe the arrangement with the<br>waikato river Authority as shockingly<br>time no assets have been stolen these no<br>powers have been grabbed it's a bunch of<br>people sitting around a board table<br>doing board stuff<br>and making decisions decisions and<br>sharing the accountability for financing<br>and outcomes<br>probably the distinguishing feature<br>however is that they're doing it on the<br>consensus basis so they keep talking it<br>through until they reach a consensus<br>um I think I'm going to leave it there I<br>will make some other comments<br>um throughout this discussion I do want<br>to share another story though when I I<br>had a meeting with the CEO who will<br>remain anonymous who seriously thought<br>that co-management meant having a cup of<br>tea with me every six months uh he got<br>the message very quickly because we<br>never ever had a cup of tea again<br>instead that was replaced with a<br>decision-making committee with equal<br>numbers of counselors representing our<br>communities central government officials<br>and of course waikato River ewe leaders<br>so from a waka's autonomy perspective<br>the relationships that we've forged over<br>time will continue to endure and the<br>benefits gained from this Arrangement<br>are for current and future generations<br>to enjoy I want to leave this with a<br>comment from my fellow tribal leader<br>tuku Morgan and I'm going to be much<br>more diplomatic he's much more harder<br>hitting in straight to the point but he<br>also says what is good for waikato is<br>good for the region and great for our<br>nation<br>thank you<br>Jason<br>um<br>foreign<br>to be here in the company of greatness I<br>think we've got uh former Minister here<br>he's had a lot to do with my iwi<br>who settled with uh with the crown on<br>the 3D settlements some years ago and<br>also parikhafia when I was a policy<br>analyst and to Pune cookery in the 1990s<br>parikhafia was at the department of<br>prime minister and cabinet that we used<br>to look up to parikhafia I used to take<br>advice from<br>when I was writing our cabinet papers<br>and whatnot so I had a lot of fun in<br>those days but um my cope upper Now is<br>really all about supporting indigenous<br>Economic Development and<br>Entrepreneurship so Dakota around<br>co-governance and this forum the<br>suspicious occasion is really how can we<br>Foster and grow Maori Economic<br>Development Maori Enterprise development<br>through whatever it is we we are talking<br>about today<br>and so on the cope up of co-governance I<br>guess I've got five points to make in my<br>two minutes probably now the first one<br>is that when we're thinking about<br>co-governance and co-management and<br>co-editing we have a model<br>a model to follow and it's<br>the Treaty of waitangi and so if we're<br>unsure about what co-governance actually<br>looks like you know read the Treaty of<br>waitangi just read the document read our<br>ancestors Maori ancestors wrote there<br>and why they wrote it and what it means<br>for us today<br>and it's about partnership it's about<br>working together it's about including<br>each other's views each other's<br>knowledges each other's aspirations and<br>what is best for our nation for our<br>country<br>and inside that uh that treaty there's a<br>kaupapa called<br>is all about tribal autonomy<br>is about the tribe deciding what is best<br>for its people<br>and their fenua their lands their Waters<br>not just for themselves but for all of<br>us<br>all of us and our<br>it's called papa is nothing else<br>why is that important Because unless we<br>decide what's important and what is best<br>then someone else will decide for us<br>so co-governance starts with<br>acknowledging<br>the treaty partner coming together to<br>offer the best not just for Maori but<br>so the other thing that I wanted to say<br>as examples where does this happen and I<br>was going to talk about tuhui but<br>Christopher reminded me<br>you know tuhui governance is actually<br>you know it's not co-governance it's<br>it's duhui governance over do the<br>weather so we can park that one<br>um uh what I wanted to talk about is two<br>examples one is called a group that you<br>by a Ministry of Foreign Affairs and<br>trade and Maori who have an interest in<br>trade around the time that New Zealand<br>hosted epic 2021<br>it was a partnership body co-governance<br>Institute you know co-governance<br>organization although Jane Kelsey<br>counseled me and she said don't call it<br>co-governance it's a structure of<br>partnership Jason okay go to Jane thank<br>you and uh and I was also counseled by<br>uh Pizza tip and here anyone know Pizza<br>Tiffany very formidable man and<br>Jane and uh and pitcher and Moana and<br>others who are involved in that group<br>and also to tomata very clearly said<br>that<br>you know it's treaty partnership<br>we have our contribution to make and the<br>government has its contribution to make<br>to achieve best outcomes from apic 2021<br>and if you want to look at what<br>co-governance looks like read the<br>principles of that agreement they took<br>six months to negotiate so a lot of uh<br>tough conversations<br>you can imagine with pizza you know it's<br>going to hold the line so that's an<br>example for us to look at as to<br>co-governance and how it influences<br>policy the other one that again we may<br>not have heard of but some of you may be<br>participating in it either you know or<br>you don't know but as it is our churches<br>you take any church in this country and<br>you look at the structure<br>the way in which they operate and they<br>have uh you know they have their Maori<br>Synod they have their pancakes in it<br>they've got Fijian tolerance in it<br>whether it's the methodists the<br>Catholics anglicans Presbyterians they<br>all acknowledge tertility await them<br>they acknowledge mataranga Maori they<br>acknowledge Maori<br>and their ways of being as part of the<br>church structure the way that they make<br>decisions said policy provide for their<br>churches look after assets together<br>may not always be harmonious<br>you know but they have an example for us<br>to look at<br>and then the the other thing that I just<br>wanted to say briefly<br>tribal autonomy and and these sorts of<br>things it's evidence-based it works<br>it's not just evidence<br>you go to Harvard<br>they've been studying this for 30 years<br>self-determination for tribal peoples<br>results in the best possible outcomes<br>better than any government Department<br>could produce better than any other<br>private Corporation<br>so it works so when you hand and you<br>acknowledge<br>self-determination of tribal peoples<br>best possible economic outcomes result<br>so in short<br>basically if we want uh Economic<br>Development among tribal people among<br>Maori whether that's entrepreneurs or<br>businesses what we need to be talking<br>about is how do we give effective<br>how do we grab it and support it and<br>enable it because the best possible<br>outcomes result from it and we get a<br>treaty partner who is geared up and<br>ready to do business and to make the<br>best possible decisions for our people<br>Jason<br>fantastic openings all three so thank<br>you all right I'm going to dive into<br>there are a lot of questions have come<br>through here from the audience and will<br>give an opportunity directly as well I'm<br>going to start on co-governance I won't<br>stay only on co-governance this is a<br>broader discussion but uh Christopher<br>your article and The Listener recently I<br>can wholeheartedly recommend that to the<br>uh to the group here you talked about<br>co-management and I think you've just<br>told us to expunge the governance term<br>from this and you've applied it very<br>clearly there to co-management of<br>resources we have examples the waikato<br>river and so on can you explain to us<br>how that might work or whether it should<br>work in your view across areas that are<br>not natural resource based because I<br>think in the last<br>six to 12 months some of the reasons<br>that co-governance has became a flash<br>point in discussions have been about<br>understandings or misunderstandings<br>around application through broader areas<br>of policy sure well in my experience let<br>me take you to my time as Minister for<br>arts and culture because I was dealing<br>with a number of bodies<br>for example what was once known as the<br>historic places trust it's now Heritage<br>New Zealand and also the Arts Council<br>and there were on within the structure<br>of those organizations there were<br>particular Maori bodies so for example<br>for years we've had the Maori Heritage<br>Council as part of what is now Heritage<br>New Zealand and with the Arts Council<br>since Doug Graham's reforms in the early<br>1990s<br>when creative New Zealand was was born<br>we've had to walk a toy so these sorts<br>of bodies are not unknown the whether or<br>not they are co-governance I don't think<br>they are but there are specific bodies<br>within organizations what you are asking<br>is the extent to which this principle of<br>that I outlined in relation to Natural<br>Resources<br>should also be applied in other areas of<br>government Administration and that's<br>where there is a debate and it will come<br>as no surprise to you I inclined to the<br>views of Mr luxon who said that<br>co-governance as a means by which<br>service can be provided in all instances<br>may not be the right approach that what<br>we need to do is focus heavily on<br>provide ensuring that there are top<br>quality services which<br>are available for everyone but that's<br>the area of contemporary debate and<br>we're in an election season where<br>presumably some of those themes will<br>emerge I think the real problem in all<br>this has come from the and I I don't<br>think there's some kind of jesuitical<br>plan out there but I I think an<br>inability to articulate what<br>co-governance<br>means<br>beyond what I've been talking about and<br>into the more article 3 issues thank you<br>I might go to patakathia and very<br>genuinely feel free to pass on questions<br>I'm conscious of your uh your your<br>mandate as a as a leader within the<br>public sector as well so<br>building on what Christopher's just said<br>can you talk to us what's your take on<br>the applications of co-management<br>co-governance the incorporation of tell<br>Maori and the crown into delivery of<br>other services we've obviously you look<br>at education<br>a very long-term model health is a big<br>topic now how do you see that working<br>and how do you believe that should work<br>yeah look that's a that's a really<br>important question and um<br>I'll tell you what is not co-governance<br>maybe if I start there and I'll use the<br>whole order reforms as an example<br>um the mighty health authority is not I<br>believe a representation of<br>co-governance and why I say that if<br>if I look at the waikato river Authority<br>where you have equal membership of crown<br>appointments appointees and River ewe<br>appointees as well as and there's a mix<br>on the crown side you've got local<br>government leaders and so on the Maori<br>health authority<br>they were appointed by ministers under<br>the pay order Act<br>they are a statutory entertain<br>similarly as tiffati water so I think<br>it's really important to make that's<br>that really clear that because that that<br>keeps coming up I think in that public<br>debate what is co-governance from a a<br>social policy perspective so certainly<br>in my view anyway the mighty health<br>authority is not a co-governance<br>Arrangement the question however is how<br>do you improve or how do you address the<br>what is the mechanism to address Health<br>inequities for a significant population<br>our Maori communities and Pacific<br>peoples you look at the evidence you<br>look at it the epidemiological evidence<br>and you know it's been like this for the<br>six a number of generations<br>that is a response there's one response<br>that has come out of the pay order<br>legislation but it's not the only<br>response if I think about the response<br>to covert<br>the real change happened on the ground<br>in terms of vaccination with the many<br>providers including hoora Maori<br>providers Pacific providers our pho's<br>mainstream providers were joined up<br>together and responded really I Believe<br>In some cases they didn't need to be<br>told by Wellington in fact that's the<br>thing you don't need to be given a<br>mandate from Wellington to know what you<br>need to do in the case of covert people<br>got out there and did what they had to<br>do pulled together to respond so that's<br>sort of that's my opening comment there<br>around<br>co-governance and Arrangements like that<br>thank you for social policy I'm going to<br>go into a question here that's come<br>through and it's one that um<br>if you if you if you if you stray on<br>your radio dial when you're driving into<br>the world of TalkBack radio this is the<br>one where you'll get people really<br>diving in and so on so but I'm really<br>interested in your views as thought<br>leaders in this space are there<br>circumstances where<br>people who are Maori should have<br>different decision making rights based<br>on Anderson Street when it comes to<br>provision of Public Services<br>Jason<br>well<br>if you're thinking about<br>you know when when organizations<br>institutions<br>uh want to incorporate<br>in what they do whether that's a<br>university<br>or a health Ministry or a business a<br>large firm that deals with and works<br>with Maori<br>a lot of organizations now are sort of<br>saying well how do we incorporate them<br>into our organization and what it is we<br>do so we get better outcomes for people<br>whether that's health or education or<br>anything else<br>the the problem you strike in that<br>situation is who is the treaty partner<br>and how do we recognize them who do we<br>talk to<br>who as the treating partner<br>for instance if an organization like a<br>university I won't pick on this one<br>because I work for this one now I pick<br>on the one I used to work for<br>now if a university says we want to be<br>utility lit we want to incorporate or<br>waitangi and everything we do that's<br>wonderful<br>who is the treaty partner you've got a<br>vice Chancellor you've got a council<br>they have all the money<br>and the managers have all the money the<br>resources the delegation<br>and so when you want to incorporate<br>utility or waiting in any organization<br>who did we talk to do you talk to your<br>Maori staff do you talk to manafinua on<br>who's fenua these organizations these<br>businesses are based Do You Talk to an<br>Advisory Group set up alongside a<br>council<br>and ask them are you the treaty partner<br>should I be talking to you<br>so when we talk about well who is the<br>treaty partner yes whakapapa does matter<br>because<br>what what that says is who you are where<br>you come from<br>where are your people buried<br>where were you brought up who do you<br> a puppets to so yes ancestry is<br>really important when it comes to my<br>right to speak my right to stand my<br>right to express my view on what is best<br>for our people and not just for Maori<br>again for all of us<br>uh so that's all I have to say on that<br>Kilda thank you Jason<br>yep I'm going to respond to this<br>um I and I I acknowledge the comments<br>that if you are listening to radio all<br>the time<br>um I don't buy into that<br>um argument about that's based on<br>Ancestry at all I think policy<br>intervention must be led by evidence and<br>there's very clear evidence around<br>inequity in Altera or New Zealand and<br>the impact that has had particularly on<br>our Maori population and Pacifica people<br>and younger our younger generation too<br>so it's purely from a policy perspective<br>and intervening on improving outcomes<br>for<br>whanau for households for businesses<br>well I mentioned to wakatoi because if<br>Circa theater or Fortune theater can't<br>apply for funding to wakatoi it's Maori<br>for Maori and so we've had these sorts<br>of bodies before the issue for debate is<br>the extent to which those sorts of<br>principles should apply to other areas<br>of government Administration and that's<br>where the debate is at the moment but do<br>not believe that these things have never<br>happened before because they have<br>thank you I'm going to pick up on a<br>point you raised in your response there<br>Jason and take it in a different<br>direction about who is the the treaty<br>party partner in this discussion the<br>title is Crown Modi relations<br>um just looking to the crown side<br>the<br>how do we reconcile the the bicultural<br>system that's inherent in that name and<br>some of these discussions with a society<br>that's visibly and obviously<br>Multicultural where people have come<br>from many different Corners over many<br>different times and may feel an<br>affiliation with the crown or may not<br>for other for other reasons do you want<br>to unpack a little bit of how we might<br>reconcile those two<br>yes uh I guess the question of are we a<br>bicultural nation or a multicultural<br>Nation does come up<br>um my view on that is that we're both<br>We're a bicultural nation in terms of<br>how we were founded it wasn't uh France<br>who were you know our ancestors were<br>doing a deal with uh it was it was<br>England and uh and and Queen Victoria<br>and and so forth and what we have<br>um from that occasion uh from tutility<br>or waitangi is a you know a coming<br>together of two cultures of two peoples<br>of two Sovereign Nations who wanted to<br>engage uh in what the future would of<br>alteoda would look like so in that sense<br>We're a bicultural nation but we also<br>Multicultural demographics tells you<br>that you know I've got Tongan and Maori<br>kids so you know there's a lot of uh you<br>know alfano out here that sort of tell<br>us that look you know we're from all<br>over the world and we need to<br>acknowledge that and under the utility<br>or waitangi there's a place for everyone<br>you know when you think about the<br>purpose of tutility or waitangi it was a<br>uh and to look after them now Maori had<br>a big sense of responsibility whenever<br>someone comes to a Maori home<br>you monarchy that person that visitor so<br>when people are coming to aotearoa you<br>monarchy them you have a responsibility<br>for their well-being and you do it to<br>the very best of your ability<br>not minimal you don't give them a ginger<br>nut cookie you put the pot on and you<br>make sure they're well fit and they're<br>so full they don't want to leave but you<br>know you just got to say you know kindly<br>please you know I gotta gotta get back<br>to my job<br>so look you know<br>um<br>we're both we're both and I'm you know<br>so pleased that to say that we are both<br>uh have we got some things to work out<br>yeah we've got a few things to work out<br>and how we work together which is the<br>quarterdal for for our our day today<br>anybody else like to comment on this one<br>oh here we go<br>I'm going to look out are there any<br>questions from yes can we get a<br>microphone to Josie<br>thank you for such a stimulating<br>conversation<br>um so uh I wondered you mentioned about<br>um<br>the Maori health authority it seems to<br>me like that's a real centralized model<br>it's it's another kind of big<br>centralized model just changing you know<br>making giving it a Maori name<br>um and then I look at the Kura model and<br>I think well kurokopapa is is Devolution<br>so I I wonder if our whole debate around<br>co-governance is kind of moved us away<br>from a debate around Devolution which<br>feels far more substantive and radical<br>to me in terms of devolution of<br>resources and decision making so which<br>is it which which one should we be going<br>for<br>I think if you ask this question<br>um and put this apartheid to the late<br>Sir Robert mahuta in fact he said it he<br>was an advocate for devolving resources<br>decision making fully to the treaty<br>partner to ewe clearly that's not where<br>we're at we're in a an environment and a<br>time as we should be and picking up on<br>the comedy that Jason made That We're a<br>nation that allows for all<br>and so we have a variety of Institutions<br>I think that's a I think that's an<br>excellent question and one of the great<br>debates that we're going to have this<br>year is whether the centralized Centra<br>petal tendency of this government is a<br>good thing or a bad thing I'm a<br>centrifugalist I'm a great believer in<br>Devolution because having been a<br>minister for nine years I believe the<br>institutional state<br>simply cannot do what is necessary and<br>as a matter of principle you devolve so<br>much as is possible to local communities<br>because you will achieve better outcomes<br>that's some people would say that's<br>reaganism I would say it's good solid<br>Common Sense the central government<br>there is a belief in Wellington and it's<br>a genuine belief and I'm sure it's a<br>noble belief but it's a crazy belief<br>that the state can through Wellington<br>can solve problems it can't The<br>Institute and and I know for that that<br>you know when poto Williams recently<br>said that Kelvin had said to her that<br>good luck sister everyone hates Doc and<br>that you apply that across the board<br>because the institutional State doesn't<br>understand ewe<br>um<br>I'm going to stay with you for a moment<br>Christopher there's a question come<br>through specifically<br>to you in your time as as Minister uh<br>more than 50 treaty settlements where to<br>next for the treaty settlement process<br>and then of interested in other views<br>well um thank you for asking that<br>question whoever it was<br>um it wasn't 50 it was 60. and<br>I was recently at something where<br>someone said oh well you know we're on<br>to the uh we're on to the difficult<br>settlements now as if two hoi was a sort<br>of a dog in the park<br>um so I think that's a way of<br>rationalizing the citation Pace that<br>we've had in the last little period so I<br>think that there will be a period where<br>uh hopeful and hopefully final<br>settlements will be achieved I make no<br>apologies for the fact that I<br>um was very keen to see treaty<br>settlements if you want a good read the<br>Taylor Diagon and Barry report on ewe<br>achievement obviously waikato tainui is<br>an outstanding success but one that I<br>need to mention to you is natitoa with<br>whom Stephen and I settled in the early<br>2010s and we settled for about 90<br>million dollars and the TDP report says<br>they're worth about 800 million now a<br>bit of gearing because of all that<br>wonderful Housing Development around<br>Kenner Peru but they've got on with it<br>and I want other ewe to enjoy that but<br>then you ask the the next question where<br>to from there<br>I am adamant<br>that if the institutional State doesn't<br>honor the commitments that were made by<br>the political state<br>then we'll be back to the drawing boards<br>again because we say that they're full<br>and final and yet there are many<br>undertakings<br>that have not been honored by the crowd<br>so it's the again it's the state has to<br>get its act in order recognize that<br>these are not commercial deals which are<br>done and dusted and you can move on to<br>something else they are I believe that<br>constitutional agreements<br>and that there is a real obligation on<br>the part of the state to ensure that<br>these are honored and more than that<br>that uh<br>if I can use Pentecost Sunday we've got<br>to breathe the spirit into these<br>agreements on a regular basis because<br>they are not dry commercial agreements<br>and if they are treated like that then<br>folks they're going to fail and the next<br>generation will be back to the drawing<br>board<br>thank you any other comments on there I<br>mean Christopher's made some very<br>powerful statements and I certainly<br>support them as a as an ewe leader I'm<br>often asked and invited to meet with ewe<br>who've just settled and one of the<br>couple of things that I say to them<br>first of all to get yourself through<br>negotiating a a claim requires quite a<br>different set of skills and expertise<br>for actually driving through an agenda<br>of building the prosperity of an ewe<br>they're very different set of skill sets<br>and so I say to ewe that have just set<br>or really invest in your strategic plan<br>going forward but also identify the key<br>capability skill sets that you require<br>to drive your drive the future forward<br>for your people and thirdly there's no<br>such thing as over communication you've<br>got to get out there and talk it to your<br>people but also to The Wider public<br>about what you are doing natitor is an<br>excellent example that is operating<br>under the radar and in a very short<br>space of time you know they're at the<br>they're almost a billion dollar entity<br>um<br>we were the first ones off the rank but<br>there were a number of others coming as<br>well<br>Napoli I'm going to acknowledge because<br>that is the the claim that store has to<br>be resolved and I'm having got an apple<br>here whanau and friends I hope that that<br>can be achieved certainly in my lifetime<br>Builder we are close to time but I I<br>might ask one question Jim<br>father<br>fascinating discussion<br>but my question cuts to the chase I<br>think having been involved with treaty<br>settlements from the beginning in the<br>thank you tainui I've said to many many<br>times Having the courage to go first<br>somebody had to break the mold<br>and it's certainly not our friends not<br>really up the north ever a bit more if<br>we go down just make that observation<br>and passing<br>um and of course I worked with Chris on<br>tuhoi and that was remarkable when we<br>reached the decision and it was in the<br>office with Chris finlinson and his team<br>that rather than dividing ourselves<br>Forever on who owned the land<br>we declared the land owned itself and<br>that is<br>a dramatic shift in the normal approach<br>to everything it is no no somebody has<br>to be the owner<br>and this we turned around<br>and said no<br>the land owns itself<br>we are just say to look after to manage<br>it and when you think about that that of<br>course fits entirely into the whole<br>environmental in in conservation debate<br>and whatever we're doing and and fits in<br>very well and it's good but that wasn't<br>my question I got so stranger<br>my question is we'll bring out the cough<br>soon my my question is the much more<br>serious one<br>most new zealanders see co-governments<br>as giving preference to one part of New<br>Zealand over another I'm sorry I they<br>half them are presumed to approach me<br>because somehow although I'm responsible<br>for I have no idea why but and ask me<br>what we're going to do about it and I'd<br>like the panel to how do we move people<br>I couldn't accept what Chris and<br>paragraphy have been saying in terms of<br>what we should be talking about<br>but we're not as a society as a<br>community we're not how do we move the<br>community to that space so they have<br>that what I describe as a broader<br>understanding of what we're talking<br>about one based on the treaty because<br>I'm somewhat fearful if we don't we have<br>one political party who looks like<br>they're going to be influential wants to<br>have a referendum on what the treaty<br>means could you think of anything more<br>divisive<br>in New Zealand than that but that's a<br>serious proposition and and it's been<br>said it will be part of the requirement<br>to go into a coalition<br>to possibly form the next government<br>so we have some big issues not just<br>being Keen to get the view of the panel<br>thank you thank you<br>Jason I might start at your ends and<br>then uh we won't go too long on this<br>because I'm conscious we um as you said<br>with uh Theodore and the tuhui I think<br>this that discussion does lead directly<br>into our next panel around taking care<br>of the environment but Jason you're<br>taking we'll go quickly through<br>thank you for the question<br>um<br>I guess um the future just just briefly<br>um I think the the what we could do is<br>to model<br>the process of having a debate on what<br>uh in Partnership under<br>looks like on what we hope it to be or<br>what we want it to be so uh that<br>everyone sort of has a feel like they<br>can be part of the conversation part of<br>the debate and share their views but<br>model it on what we you know what what<br>the what the treaty sort of says around<br>partnership so basically a partnership<br>based approach it's not once I'd say<br>well we're going to define it<br>it's not the other saying well we're<br>already there it's actually how do we<br>bring both parties together and have a<br>have a meaningful discussion about the<br>future and just lastly uh you know<br>tutility or waitangi settlements treaty<br>settlements is not the end it's just the<br>beginning correct it's the beginning of<br>our relationship together and it sets<br>out some rules some values and some<br>things that we've got to do towards one<br>another and if we follow them<br>would be okay<br>um oh gosh this is probably a session on<br>its own to be honest Matt but um from my<br>perspective it is doing what uh Jason<br>has recommended and also you know we've<br>got to get more of the communications<br>and have more conversations like this<br>but I also wonder too whether we need to<br>engage more proactively with the Next<br>Generation because they uh and I and I<br>think of my children<br>um am I mokopuna they have quite a<br>different take on us as a nation and<br>they're more exposed to the Maori Del<br>Pacifica to other cultures and<br>um and I think that's where the effort<br>in energy has to be put to be honest I<br>think we have to accept there will<br>always be a part of our population that<br>will never and will are not interested<br>in engaging on matters to do with the<br>tariti but I don't believe and this is<br>me being the person that I am that that<br>is the same with our younger generation<br>where we've got this introduced into the<br>very quickly I think there are two limbs<br>to it it's first know what you're<br>talking about and that's the<br>responsibility of the political class to<br>have clarity about what they're talking<br>about and the reason why we have some<br>unfortunate outbursts about<br>co-governance is because the<br>the the concept is muddled and It's<br>upsetting otherwise good people I agree<br>with paracafia you're always going to<br>have the<br>Douglas heard called them the SAR right<br>you know they hate homosexuals hate Jews<br>the walks we're going to cut out you're<br>always going to have those people but<br>the vast majority of people uh have good<br>intentions and are well-spirited but<br>they need to know what you're talking<br>about and it's muddled at the moment so<br>I can understand why there's some fear<br>and so clarity about are we moving<br>beyond what<br>I negotiated in my nine years into new<br>territory<br>of co-governs if we are why are we doing<br>it and what do we mean by it and the<br>second thing is once you have Clarity<br>explain and explain and explain uh John<br>Key took me to one side during the<br>foreshore and seabed debate and said get<br>out there and explain what you're doing<br>in words of one syllable and stop<br>talking like a lawyer and it was Sound<br>Advice just constant repetition and he<br>used to say to us didn't he Stephen you<br>may get bored yourself I don't care if<br>you get bored your job is to communicate<br>the message so having a message<br>that's not muddled and communicating it<br>repetitively and carefully does matter<br>and<br>read Mr Finley<br>to chapter eight<br>all right um look a fantastic discussion<br>and also an important discussion I want<br>to acknowledge uh all three of you for<br>your contributions today but also your<br>contributions to this outside of this<br>room uh very much appreciated and let's<br>put our hands together and then move on<br>foreign<br>well that's a very hard act to follow<br>what a fantastic session that was<br>um but the the final question of course<br>did lead us really nicely and naturally<br>into this um into this session uh this<br>session is<br>it's really a critical discussion given<br>the overall theme of our Workshop<br>arguably the greatest challenge facing<br>us<br>and one that affects everything else and<br>of course it's been even more in the<br>spotlight<br>given the extreme weather in recent<br>weeks so our panel on sustaining the<br>natural environment how do we navigate<br>and adapt on the path to Net Zero<br>that's going to be our Focus we've got a<br>wonderful set of speakers our first<br>speaker is going to be the honorable<br>Julianne genter joining us online from<br>Zoom thanks very much Julianne A Member<br>of Parliament for the Green Party<br>our second speaker will be Malcolm Johns<br>Malcolm is the CEO of Genesis energy<br>former CEO of Christchurch Airport and a<br>member of the climate leaders coalition<br>we've got Amanda Whiting very much in<br>the spotlight at the moment her position<br>CEO at iag New Zealand uh really<br>important insights I'm sure we'll get<br>from Amanda and our final speaker in<br>this session will be bringing us a<br>wealth of knowledge and experience<br>tanira kingi he's the principal<br>consultant at kukuri research and<br>Emeritus Professor sorry Emeritus<br>research scientist at Scion<br>with that we'll pass to you Julianne and<br>uh we'll have five minutes of intro up<br>to five minutes of of info remarks to<br>leave plenty of time for discussion<br>um<br>I'm going to start just going a bit big<br>picture<br>um which is that we need nature and a<br>healthy ecosystems in order for us to<br>thrive and we absolutely can live in<br>harmony with nature but for many decades<br>it's been passed as a trade-off as if<br>protecting restoring and sustaining<br>natural ecosystems is a cost and that at<br>times we can't afford it as was<br>referenced all of you know<br>in the last few weeks out heroa has been<br>hit really hard with severe weather<br>events and flooding and that's had<br>enormous impact on people's lives some<br>have lost homes some have lost their<br>livelihoods and even some lives have<br>been lost which is absolutely tragic<br>one thing that I've really noticed is<br>that in times of Crisis we also see the<br>very best of people we have seen<br>communities come together we've seen<br>people bravely face danger to help their<br>neighbors they've shared Kai and<br>we do this out of love and compassion<br>our human civilization has largely<br>progressed because of cooperation and I<br>think we all know that it feels good to<br>help other people we raise our children<br>out of love we look after our sick<br>relatives we make meals for friends we<br>volunteer<br>but our current economic system ignores<br>some of the most important Mahi that we<br>do<br>it only values commercial transactions<br>so it pretends the only things that<br>matter are those times when money is<br>changing hands<br>and it really cannot differentiate when<br>money is earned as the result of a<br>genuine contribution which many times it<br>is or whether it wealth as being amassed<br>through some exploitation whether that<br>be of people or of Natural Resources<br>so just as an example globally we have<br>this outrageous situation where the<br>biggest oil companies the industry is<br>most responsible for some of our<br>ecological crises and the climate chaos<br>we're already starting to experience<br>made record profits last year in 2022.<br>we have a handful of people who are<br>supposedly worth thousands of times more<br>than our essential workers who actually<br>keep our economy going you know the<br>people who collect our rubbish midwives<br>nurses Early Childhood teachers and also<br>the people who stay home to raise<br>children and look after relatives and<br>community members<br>so I think in order to sustain our<br>natural environment we need to really<br>execute a big shift in how we approach<br>the economy<br>the reality is that everyone needs a<br>decent secure place to call home<br>nourishing Kai Health Care education and<br>when people have those needs met they're<br>able to bring their best selves and<br>we're going to need everyone because<br>humans are going to need to cooperate<br>like never before in order for us to<br>combat this climate crisis and adapt to<br>the warming that's already locked in<br>so that's the big picture<br>um everyone can have a livable income<br>and live with dignity if we change some<br>of our tax settings uh to tax wealth and<br>excess profit of some of those uh<br>corporations that have been doing too<br>well<br>there's two other big important ideas<br>which I'll briefly touch upon so my<br>background before I got into politics<br>was Urban Regional planning and<br>transport planning there's a huge<br>opportunity to design our infrastructure<br>and our human settlements in a way that<br>works with nature rather than against it<br>and it's kind of a win-win but it does<br>mean doing things differently and so I<br>guess changing those institutions that<br>are usually responsible for delivering<br>that infrastructure helping people get<br>on board with new ways of doing things<br>and evolving more responsibility to<br>communities is how I think we're going<br>to facilitate that and finally um half<br>Earth I don't know if there's a<br>wonderful book called half Earth and it<br>really stresses the importance of wild<br>places and humans part of how we respond<br>to climate change I think has to be just<br>allowing more land and more of our<br>oceans to be completely Untouched by<br>humans for a while so that life can<br>bounce back well actually probably in<br>perpetuity but um I think the current<br>focus on Net Zero maybe is a little<br>overly focused on accounting and we need<br>to just recognize we're not going to be<br>able to account for all the all the<br>things we just need to focus on more<br>land more of our oceans being protected<br>and conserved<br>very much for those remarks Julianne um<br>with that we'll move on to Malcolm<br>please<br>what I thought I'd do is just talk a<br>little bit about my practical<br>experiences in this area over the last<br>three or four years and in 2018 the<br>Prime Minister asked me if I would be<br>one of New Zealand's delegates to the<br>Apec Business Council which I agreed to<br>which is made up of the 21 economies of<br>the Asia Pacific region and I was asked<br>to lead the climate change working group<br>and when I joined the council president<br>Trump was in office in the U.S and that<br>meant that we weren't allowed to use the<br>words climate change in our working<br>group and if we did the U.S delegation<br>had to leave the conversation thankfully<br>that changed to President Biden and the<br>U.S has moved into much more of an<br>aggressive aggressive stance in terms of<br>that there's a couple of learnings that<br>I took out of the the journey that I had<br>with that group of people first of all<br>before the Ukraine Invasion Russia was<br>part of the conversation and I had the<br>privilege of being lectured at length on<br>how green the Russian petrochemical<br>industry was and how much it could<br>contribute to decarbonizing the world<br>but I also had the opportunity to hear<br>from 19 other economies in the region in<br>terms of how they viewed not only<br>climate change but New Zealand and it's<br>very interesting that there is no one<br>single view of what climate change means<br>some economies look at it through the<br>lens of potable water others through<br>Waste Management others through pure<br>Economic Opportunity but if I take New<br>Zealand's philosophy on climate change<br>we have about four other economies out<br>of 21 that line up with our personal or<br>our national view of climate change<br>the second thing that I learned is the<br>importance of sweeping your own backyard<br>first<br>so during my time in the council the<br>things that I was tackled on was why<br>does New Zealand protect its<br>agricultural sector<br>why does New Zealand provide tax breaks<br>on fossil fuels and that was only two<br>weeks ago that I was tackled on there uh<br>you know things like why does New<br>Zealand protect its National Airline one<br>of the most protected airlines in the<br>world and those were things that really<br>surprised me because coming from New<br>Zealand out to the rest of the world<br>they were in perspectives that I held<br>but they are views from the outside<br>looking in now there are two things that<br>I think are really critical uh for this<br>forum to get its head around in terms of<br>sustainability and climate change the<br>first is there are irrefutable facts we<br>have one atmosphere it does not have a<br>variable denominator so if we're using<br>climate change models that have variable<br>denominators in our businesses in our<br>economies Etc then we're not actually<br>transitioning we're just extending the<br>status quo<br>the second non-negotiable is that for<br>any economy in the world whether they<br>are autocratic Democratic or any other<br>form is that energy security and food<br>security are non-negotiables when it<br>comes to dealing with climate change<br>for New Zealand there is a threat on the<br>horizon and that is that as geopolitics<br>comes to dominate trade policy<br>climate change could be weaponized for<br>trade protection and for geopolitical<br>convenience and that would be terrible<br>from a dealing with climate change<br>perspective<br>the second is we have to sweep our own<br>backyard first so it's not for us to go<br>into the world in a highly moralistic<br>way and begin to tackle what is a global<br>a global issue we have to make sure that<br>we have our own house in order first<br>and what's happened in the last two<br>years is public sentiment has moved from<br>a focus on mitigation to an absolute<br>requirement on adaptation<br>and one of the challenges we have in<br>terms of critical infrastructure has<br>come to the fore over the last month or<br>so and that is that many of much of the<br>infrastructure that is critical to food<br>security to energy security to transport<br>Logistics Etc in New Zealand is built on<br>the ambition of a previous generation<br>it's not built on the ambition of a<br>current generation<br>and our ability to move that to a much<br>more resilient state is hampered<br>primarily by the consenting processes<br>that have to be followed in New Zealand<br>under the resource management act we<br>treat critical infrastructure under that<br>act the same way we treat building a<br>Burger King on a corner uh and we have<br>to ask ourselves really do we want up to<br>40 cents in every dollar invested over<br>the next 20 years going into a process<br>to get a consent to either add new<br>critical infrastructure to deal with<br>energy transition in New Zealand or to<br>move existing critical infrastructure to<br>new locations so that we can become more<br>resilient in events like Cyclone<br>Gabrielle so the two things that are<br>critical to New Zealand sweep our own<br>backyard first and understand the<br>non-negotiables of climate change from a<br>social perspective and make it easier<br>for businesses in New Zealand to invest<br>money in adaptation rather than in the<br>process for permission to begin this the<br>process of adaptation thank you<br>Malcolm<br>welcome you're almost stole some of my<br>thunder there because you know we're in<br>we're right in a moment now<br>where we have a massive opportunity to<br>start thinking differently about how we<br>adapt<br>we've just experienced two major Peril<br>events in a space of two weeks and I'm I<br>I believe that's going to be the new<br>normal<br>so last year we saw our perilous events<br>double<br>almost double<br>um and I think that's going to be the<br>way the the way that we live here in New<br>Zealand<br>so<br>um just to give you a few statistics<br>around where we're at there's been 78<br>000 claims lodged for the like the last<br>two events that's bigger than kaikoura<br>um we've had an event in Auckland that<br>I've been in Insurance a long time and<br>I've I've never seen an event where<br>there is flash flooding in a city<br>it's pretty incredible<br>Cyclone Gabrielle has spread across the<br>whole North Island so we're no longer<br>talking about how we support a community<br>it's support supporting multiple<br>communities<br>and I was in Hawke's Bay a couple of<br>days ago and talking to my team in the<br>afternoon and they said just give us<br>some words to describe what you've seen<br>and I said I actually can't because<br>there isn't a word big enough for me to<br>describe what has happened here in this<br>community<br>and I'm raising all of those things<br>because I think we have to step into the<br>and we definitely need to be thinking<br>about how reducing carbon emissions but<br>we also need to be focusing in on<br>adaptation<br>and as I said we've got a great<br>opportunity here where there are many<br>people that have been impacted their<br>homes their livelihoods we need to lean<br>into this and think very differently<br>about how we rebuild or build better<br>so with with that in mind<br>um you know we've got a national<br>adaptation plan I genuinely believe that<br>we can start very simply it's always<br>difficult when you look at these things<br>in big picture but my view is that we<br>can start really simply by just<br>identifying where these high risk areas<br>are and we've got the mapping government<br>have got the mapping other stakeholders<br>have got the mapping pull that all<br>together<br>and then move to stopping development in<br>those areas unless it is in a way that<br>actually mitigates any of the risk<br>and then lastly we start to invest<br>regularly in the communities that we<br>know have significant exposure and that<br>we can help them adapt<br>uh<br>uh<br>Jason<br>good morning everyone I'm going to pick<br>up on the point raised earlier about the<br>protection of the of the Agricultural<br>sector<br>and my interests here is in the primary<br>sector's ability to be able to reach<br>The Net Zero targets of 2050 but also<br>the agricultural sector's ability to to<br>meet the<br>2030 domestic Target<br>of<br>reductions of 10 by 2030.<br>and in recent years we've had a number<br>of Christ from the sector to say that<br>uh the sector has never been under so<br>much pressure from from regulation but<br>at the other end of the spectrum we've<br>got uh commentators and uh and others<br>who are saying that it's long overdue<br>and the agricultural sector should have<br>gone into the ets a long a long time ago<br>but I want to look at that uh that the<br>positioning between regulation<br>and and Market demands Market<br>requirements<br>because right now we have a number of<br>our biggest buyers of our of our<br>products uh<br>such as Nestle dunon Mars<br>old Lambs are the biggest ingredient in<br>product buyers in the world<br>who are very very ambitious targets much<br>more ambitious targets than we have in<br>our domestic<br>domestic targets under the ccra<br>of reducing emissions by 50 by 2030.<br>and then going through to<br>um to Net Zero by 2050. donone has just<br>come out in 2023<br>ends and said that they want to see the<br>supply chain<br>of all of the milk that they produce<br>reducing by 30 percent<br>by 2030.<br>so we've got a we've got a target of 10<br>and there is resistance there what I<br>want to understand and this is a<br>question that I'll leave for the floor<br>is why do we have some of our biggest<br>processes and marketers in this country<br>that aren't setting gross emissions<br>reductions but carbon neutral<br>the second point I I want to make is<br>around the inertia<br>that's uh that has some parts of the<br>Agricultural sector has<br>in in opposing uh change and if we look<br>back at the history of of the<br>Agricultural sector and some would say<br>it started in 1814 when Samuel Marsden<br>brought over<br>a number of uh of beef beef and dairy<br>kettles which which were the start of<br>the of the um the agricultural industry<br>in the country and if we look at the<br>timeline<br>from then through to 1871 when the first<br>when the first Cooperative was was<br>produced through to 1923 when the dairy<br>border was established a few years later<br>New Zealand's agricultural University<br>was set up now NASA University and in<br>1926 and in 1927 we had Dairy Research<br>Institute that's all happened in the<br>last 100 years<br>so my question is you know have we got<br>the right institutions to drive the<br>change that's needed we've got Levy and<br>this is not a criticism against our<br>levy-funded organizations<br>but when their very existence relies on<br>on collecting levies from Farmers<br>that want the status Cut quote to<br>continue we've got to we've got the<br>question whether we've got the right<br>institutions to drive the restructuring<br>that's needed my my final point<br>is around Maori agribusiness and Maori<br>agriculture<br>and picking on some of the points that<br>paragraphia in in Jason talked about<br>uh around around the response of the<br>Maori sector to to both the the ccra<br>targets and also also all of the other<br>regulation that's going on around fresh<br>water<br>and there were a couple of things that<br>we need to understand there firstly that<br>the the elected representatives of these<br>organizations are there is so they are<br>are appointed by their family and hapu<br>representatives to make sure that that<br>land the water and the people are<br>protected so their identity doesn't<br>doesn't depend on them being a Dairy<br>Farmer a sheep sheep and beef farmer or<br>a Forester it's about doing the right<br>thing so I might just leave it at that<br>thank you thank you very much wow what a<br>rich set of intro<br>um remarks are coming from such a wide<br>range of experience and expertise it's<br>kind of difficult to know exactly where<br>to start but I will open it up to if<br>people would like to take the microphone<br>please wave out and we'll get a<br>microphone over to you<br>um otherwise I think partly because of<br>the nature of our panelists we're going<br>to end up with some rather specific<br>questions to the individual panelists so<br>I will tend to direct some of these<br>questions to particular panelists but of<br>course if somebody else has something<br>burning that they would like to jump in<br>but don't worry there's questions for<br>all of you I'm seeing coming through<br>here<br>um<br>okay do wave out on the floor if you've<br>got anything Julianne if you don't mind<br>I'll start with um you we've got a<br>question come through on slido<br>um on electric car subsidies<br>uh it would be interesting to hear from<br>you<br>um how can the government handle the<br>inevitable inequity issues that would<br>accompany or that do accompany car<br>subsidies<br>that's really interesting so I when I<br>was associate minister of Transport last<br>term I worked on the clean car discount<br>and clean car standard and I assume that<br>the person asking the question is asking<br>about the clean car discount yes I think<br>so to make it really clear it's not a<br>subsidy for cars it's a price incentive<br>within the market of cars coming to New<br>Zealand and that's a really important<br>distinction if we were to fund the<br>discount from the general Consolidated<br>fund from Education Health or money that<br>would other will otherwise be used for<br>other purposes it would I think be a<br>subsidy and I was really<br>very<br>determined not to do that that wouldn't<br>have made sense but New Zealand was<br>really far behind<br>um other oecd countries we had no fuel<br>economy standards we had no price<br>incentive for cleaner cars most of the<br>people who are buying new to New Zealand<br>cars<br>are actually corporations or you know<br>car rental companies businesses<br>and um and then there's a really small<br>percentage of New Zealand households<br>that buy new to New Zealand cars<br>and the most polluting cars like the<br>highest emissions ones were actually new<br>cars not secondhand<br>so um but most new zealanders Buy<br>second-hand vehicles within New Zealand<br>so the purpose of the clean car discount<br>was to provide both<br>the financial incentive for the<br>suppliers to bring in lower emissions<br>Vehicles including zero emissions<br>vehicles and then the standard kicks in<br>as well so those two policies work in<br>tandem to change the vehicles that are<br>being brought into the fleet and then<br>the more clean vehicles that we're<br>importing the more that will filter<br>through to the second hand market so<br>there's just there was no way to<br>influence the cars coming to New Zealand<br>without some without a standard and<br>without some sort of price incentive and<br>we can see there's been a really strong<br>response to that policy much faster<br>response than what was anticipated so<br>far more zero emissions and low<br>emissions vehicles coming in now than we<br>expected<br>uh so I think it's been successful from<br>that point of view and<br>um I mean ideally the fee part on the<br>more polluting Vehicles which are not<br>vehicles that are purchased by<br>low-income households they are Range<br>Rovers they are Land Cruisers and double<br>cab Utes that are being purchased either<br>by businesses or often individuals for<br>lifestyle purposes like Towing boats and<br>Jet Skis and things like that so we<br>could show that the vast majority of the<br>feeds were going to be paid by<br>businesses and high income people but<br>there was an alternative which is they<br>could buy lower emitting vehicles and<br>indeed there were like double cab Utes<br>on the market in other countries that<br>had were lower emissions but because we<br>had no incentive until we put those<br>policies in place they weren't being<br>sold in New Zealand so<br>um I think the way to address inequity<br>in transport is to address inequity in<br>incomes and that's why I talked at the<br>beginning about Income Support<br>guaranteed minimum income when you have<br>less inequality than price signals<br>aren't such a big deal but if we don't<br>use price signals we tend to be actually<br>the majority of that benefit goes to the<br>highest income people for example the<br>cut to fuel excise and reducer charges<br>um the benefit to the richest households<br>is four or five times greater than to<br>the poorest households because the<br>richest households are more likely to<br>drive cars they drive further they buy<br>newer cars so I think um yeah we have to<br>address inequality in society and we<br>have to address emissions in an<br>effective way but we can't do that by<br>subsidizing<br>uh fuel use and and cars for the rich<br>people<br>or businesses thanks very much Julianne<br>and I guess we've also got these<br>interesting emerging issues of the<br>number of cars that have been written<br>off in in or will be written off um that<br>that's going to bring a whole well<br>perhaps Amanda might tell us it brings<br>some remarkable opportunities as well<br>but there's certainly some challenges<br>including in terms of equity<br>um for many people who's whose cars are<br>written off particularly those who are<br>not in short I might add I'll come back<br>to you in a moment Amanda but if I could<br>if I could address a question to you<br>tanira please<br>um we've got a question on what does Net<br>Zero mean for farmers and how do they<br>position themselves to be part of a net<br>zero value chain<br>is there a Maori sector perspective on<br>Net Zero some easy questions for you<br>all right so Net Zero is is better<br>understood if you see it if you see it<br>in in the full value chain or the supply<br>chain context<br>and so for net net zero at the farm<br>lever from the production level<br>um be able being able to get down to Net<br>Zero is difficult because of the<br>production system and that's why the the<br>agricultural sector has has split uh<br>carbon uh targets with methane 10<br>reduction by 2030 and then there's 36<br>average or 24 to 40 percent for our<br>2050. now the the the intention of Net<br>Zero is for is for those those Farmers<br>to be able to reduce the production<br>system through technology through Farms<br>systems improvements and that'll get you<br>so far<br>beyond that there then relies on on land<br>use change or land use diversification<br>and it's not just from grass into exotic<br>Pines<br>it includes a raft of things so that's<br>Net Zero the other term that I used was<br>was carbon neutral<br>um oh sorry just going back to Net Zero<br>the idea about Net Zero is that you get<br>your system down you get the gross<br>emissions down as far as you as you can<br>without breaking the system and that<br>includes systems change as well as as<br>land use change and then and then<br>offsetting does play a part in it carbon<br>neutral is where offsetting is used to<br>maintain the status quo to maintain<br>productive output<br>but then to offset either using credits<br>or or sequestration<br>the Maori perspective on this and there<br>isn't a single Maori perspective I<br>should say but I work with I work with<br>dozens of of uh Maori land authorities<br>uh around the country<br>who are still grappling with<br>understanding the full implications of<br>of the of the regulations<br>um but in general<br>uh in the general statement many of them<br>are committed to doing the right thing<br>because they will be judged their<br>performance now will be judged by the<br>future generations and they want to be<br>on the right side of History being able<br>to drive and push change that will do<br>the right thing for their communities<br>for the land and the water and we can't<br>look at uh carbon regulations and and<br>carbon requirements reductions<br>requirements and isolation of of fresh<br>water because you may be able to have<br>changes in your farm system that reduce<br>greenhouse gas emissions but you're<br>still<br>sending far too many contaminants into<br>into water bodies or inside your<br>catchment<br>thanks very much wow that was I I<br>thought it was a tough question but as<br>you say there are multiple perspectives<br>just a little follow-up question on the<br>agriculture one to what extent should we<br>be focusing on this carbon new territory<br>or net emissions to what extent should<br>we be focusing just on New Zealand as<br>opposed to Global<br>emissions yeah so we've uh having having<br>signed up uh to the Paris agreement and<br>and also cop 27's commitments as well we<br>do need to play our part and this is one<br>of the reasons that I I talked about our<br>agricultural producers inside the<br>context of our International markets<br>they are going to be they're going to<br>have more influence on shaping New<br>Zealand's agricultural sector than<br>regulation<br>you know Farmers need to get the hit<br>around that when to known negotiates<br>with<br>fonterra<br>that their expectations are for gross<br>emissions not not carbon neutral status<br>but gross emissions to reduce beyond the<br>ten percent I'm not going to say this so<br>don't quote me that if that conversation<br>does happen it means that that the<br>signals need to go back very clearly to<br>the to the to the farmers and they need<br>to be supported to make those changes<br>the dairy sector though I'm not going to<br>say that they're in a in an envelope<br>position but for many of them they're on<br>they're on good land and they're also<br>inside<br>regions with with infrastructure for<br>hard Hill Country Farmers that are<br>isolated they don't have a lot of<br>options in terms of what they they could<br>do once they get to that point where<br>they've reduced their farming system as<br>far as they could go with technology and<br>improvements what then and if they're<br>looking at diversification forestry is<br>not going to cut at the and we can see<br>the damage from from poor Forest<br>regulations management now trees will<br>have a have a place in the future but<br>it's likely to be a higher mixture of<br>of of natives alongside Exotics I've got<br>to say that I'm I am a climate change<br>commissioner but commissioner but<br>everything that I'm saying today is my<br>own is my own opinion it's my own<br>Viewpoint and I'm not and and this is<br>not the views of<br>um the climate change commission thanks<br>and I think Mel Malco to add yeah just<br>what a the comment that I made in terms<br>of you protecting agriculture was a<br>comment made to me not by me and it was<br>made from an economy that subsidizes<br>fishing uh and whose fish stocks are<br>going through the floor<br>um and so you know every economy has its<br>challenges what I'd say following on<br>um from those comments were one one one<br>non-negotiable is food security and so<br>no no economy in the Asia Pacific region<br>is going to sacrifice food Security in<br>service of climate change and so<br>ultimately it is how do you position<br>your sector to be World leading because<br>if a dunon or if an economy has options<br>uh for purchasing food in to meet its<br>food security needs then it's clearly<br>going to go for the most efficient or uh<br>or lowest climate impact option that it<br>can<br>thanks I'm going to move to a question<br>to Amanda first and then we'll take some<br>questions oh sorry Eva<br>yeah this is a question for everybody on<br>the panel a comment was made that we<br>might need new institutional structures<br>to address some of these issues I'd be<br>interested in the views of what that<br>might look like and how would it compare<br>with the drivers of some of the<br>commercial realities that we've talked<br>about I'm I you know how are we going to<br>get there quicker is that through these<br>new institutional structures or is it<br>through some of the commercial realities<br>that have been discussed on the panel<br>okay so that was in contrast to our<br>current institutional structures which<br>in some ways<br>I'm not going to say they're a barrier<br>but they're doing they're just doing<br>their job but their job has been shaped<br>over the last hundred years and we need<br>to we need to have structures in place<br>now that can facilitate change and and a<br>key component of that is to shape the<br>thinking and the in the in the mental<br>aptitude that's needed to face an<br>uncertain future<br>and that where we have come from as a<br>sector and I will just talk about the<br>agricultural or primary sector is that<br>we're very good at producing high volume<br>low to medium value products that go in<br>as ingredients into into other value<br>chain systems internationally we need to<br>be able to shift that if I go back to<br>the to the food security point which is<br>really valid that if if we don't<br>structure our systems in a way that we<br>can actually produce food not food<br>ingredients<br>we can we can do that but we also need<br>to be able to produce food domestically<br>for a a growing population in New<br>Zealand that we don't know the extent of<br>the next disaster that's going to that's<br>going to happen we've already had now<br>the Hawke's Bay and East Coast<br>agricultural farming Horticultural<br>sectors that have taken a hit if that<br>happens on a wider scale we need to be<br>able to design new infrastructure for<br>alternative processing and we I mean<br>right now we've got the we've got the<br>fundamentals there to be able to uh to<br>do that but it's around getting the<br>signals right getting the incentives and<br>the penalties in place that will drive<br>that change thanks Julianne did you want<br>I I completely agree with Dr what Dr<br>King has said but I um would add that<br>a much bigger role for monofinoa and<br>tangita fenua<br>um and much favorable for<br>a more devolved<br>level of governance for some of the<br>infrastructure that we need to provide<br>like the public infrastructure whether<br>that's transport or power networks<br>um<br>and you know noting the points that were<br>made about the issues with our current<br>consenting system I think there's a way<br>to give more power to communities and to<br>monofinoa and properly resource<br>institutions at that level because I<br>think the very large kind of over<br>centralized ones<br>um just aren't going to serve us for the<br>transitions we need to make<br>thanks did you want to make it the only<br>thing I'd add is that clearly the way<br>institutions are set up at the moment is<br>in silos<br>and this<br>particular scenario that we're facing<br>into now cannot be dealt with by silos<br>it either has to be devolved and um and<br>lent into by communities<br>or we have to think differently about<br>how our institutions are constructed and<br>how we work together<br>all I'd say is you got you got three<br>buckets of people in these discussions<br>you've got activists Advocates and<br>actionists and the body politic will<br>always respond to the activists the<br>institutions at the moment are serving<br>The Advocates and that has to move to<br>enabling the actionists and whether<br>that's through Devolution or some other<br>form of of change in our institutional<br>structures we have to stop talking about<br>hopes and dreams and actually start<br>empowering real action that transitions<br>every part of our society Food Systems<br>Energy Systems to concrete outcomes<br>thanks we have another question from the<br>floor if I can ask for them to be fairly<br>brief in the response as well because<br>I've got lots down here as well but<br>please go ahead thank you for for the<br>talks so my question sort of returns to<br>the bigger picture so the talk is about<br>sustaining our natural environment<br>um so it's you know broader in the sense<br>than just carbon emissions and and<br>climate change you know we've got to<br>consider biodiversity and things like<br>that too so my question is how do we get<br>resources and how do we incentivize<br>people to restore our natural<br>environment because we're in a situation<br>where people do that but they're not you<br>know they're not uh they don't benefit<br>from doing so they don't get paid for<br>doing so<br>um so is it do we need something like<br>biodiversity credits or something like<br>that because I'm just thinking of the<br>example where it's five to ten times<br>more profitable to plant monoculture<br>Pines than it is to partner an<br>indigenous native forest and we know<br>that there are significant benefits from<br>planting that Forest the indigenous<br>forest in terms of The Wider ecosystem<br>system and the resilience of the<br>ecosystem so yeah because just how do we<br>shift that um yes<br>thanks Julian maybe we'll turn to you<br>first<br>uh yeah spot on and I think biodiversity<br>credits could be a place to start but as<br>I mentioned in my opening comments I<br>think we need to have a bigger focus on<br>conservation of land and Marine areas<br>and that part of the economic transition<br>has to be supporting people<br>um so that<br>you know at the moment people who are<br>working in industries that are related<br>to environmental destruction or fossil<br>fuel consumption production you know<br>they need to worry about their<br>livelihoods and it's just it's a symptom<br>of our economic system not working that<br>it's rewarding activities that extract<br>and pollute rather than rewarding<br>activities that restore and protect and<br>so I do think you know the donor<br>economics model is something you know<br>something we need to shift to um in an<br>aotearoa specific framework you know<br>that incorporates<br>world view and values<br>um so that's like a guaranteed minimum<br>standard of living for everyone and then<br>there's a boundary on what we do in<br>terms of not overly taking from the<br>earth because we can't afford to do that<br>forever<br>any other comments okay well I'm going<br>to move on to a question that's coming<br>from slido<br>um Amanda it's it's directed at um you<br>you did mention there were possibly some<br>remarkable<br>um opportunities but the question that<br>we've got is<br>um you know on this adaptation issue<br>um<br>what's this going to what's this going<br>to require what's the role of companies<br>like your own company<br>um how are we going to move forward with<br>this<br>um and um yeah what's it going to<br>require and I guess including with a<br>focus on these very recent events yeah<br>look I think that we've got multiple<br>round tables and task forces Etc<br>um I think it's going to require a speed<br>we're going to need to make decisions<br>very quickly and in these scenarios we<br>know that we're not going to be able to<br>keep everyone happy but I think for us<br>not to move at speed at the moment we'll<br>really waste this opportunity and we'll<br>potentially be putting<br>customers and communities Back In Harm's<br>Way so I'd say it needs speed it also<br>needs it needs stakeholders around the<br>table that are prepared to do things<br>differently and and that is a challenge<br>I think<br>we can't continue to do the same thing<br>and expect a different outcome and those<br>stakeholders definitely need to be<br>coming in with very open minds around<br>how we might solve for things<br>um but it is it's just about it is about<br>leaning in we've got we've got<br>communities here who are in crisis and<br>we have an opportunity to make it make<br>it better and make it more sustainable<br>and how do you see the role of the<br>private sector the the companies such as<br>your own we've got I mean we've got an<br>awful lot of information available that<br>will actually assist government and<br>other other bodies to actually make<br>decisions<br>um so that's a good start<br>um and and then of course we'll we'll<br>have a seat at the table and we'll work<br>through different solutions so we're<br>absolutely committed to supporting<br>yeah thanks very much Jason uh can we<br>uh kyota this uh question is for Malcolm<br>uh just imagine just imagine if you were<br>tomorrow you became the prime minister<br>you became the Prime Minister now what<br>would you do to address those two points<br>that you made about<br>um you know Sweeping in our own backyard<br>and also dealing with the geopolitics<br>and its impact on our ability to address<br>climate change and climate adaptation<br>Gilda<br>um that's a hell of it that's more of a<br>nightmare than an imagination I have to<br>say<br>um<br>you know I think that uh um the first<br>thing uh in terms of sweeping our own<br>back yeah is let's be honest okay let's<br>be honest about what our own backyard<br>looks like<br>um and you know we too are a democracy<br>we too have real bottom lines<br>um uh you know the cost of living crisis<br>has shown that despite our commitment to<br>zero carbon 2050 we're prepared to offer<br>tax breaks on fuel uh fossil fuels okay<br>that's that's a reality so let's just be<br>honest about that stuff uh we live in a<br>democracy and that democracy is going to<br>shape our our ultimate response to<br>climate change in terms of food<br>production we should do everything we<br>possibly can to minimize the impact on<br>our environment from food production but<br>we should never eliminate the fact that<br>we're we're a food producer in the world<br>let's be honest about that let's just be<br>the best food producer that we can be<br>but we have low hanging fruit<br>particularly in transport and Industrial<br>heat and energy transition you can't<br>transition energy if you don't<br>transition assets okay if you've got a<br>combustion engine car you can't put<br>electricity into it so if you focus on<br>transitioning assets the energy<br>transition will occur naturally behind<br>that now to for both of those things to<br>happen you need access to Capital and<br>you need regulatory settings that enable<br>rapid asset transitions in your economy<br>uh you know you don't I I'm just<br>learning the new sector I'm going into<br>but everybody I talk to talks about how<br>hard it is to consent renewable energy<br>development how challenged we are from<br>moving electrons around our country and<br>when we do Distributing them around<br>around our cities Christchurch has an<br>electricity distribution system built to<br>5kva auckland's built to 2kva which city<br>is going to Electrify quicker than the<br>other one okay so those are those are<br>things that I would focus really heavily<br>and until terms of geopolitics<br>maintaining an independent foreign<br>policy is going to be our biggest asset<br>and our biggest challenge over the next<br>decade<br>well thank you very much I'm actually<br>going to close the questions now because<br>I can see the timer running down that's<br>that's a wonderful move into the next<br>session which of course um is going to<br>be focusing on China and the West so<br>we're taking us right up that<br>International level well I really do um<br>sincerely thank these these panelists um<br>Julianne on online uh our three<br>panelists in person I think we'll all<br>agree that the insights that they bought<br>were incredibly Rich quite diverse<br>insights we've got sectoral insights<br>we've got government insights uh we yeah<br>just the wealth of experience and<br>insights that you bought I think are<br>very much appreciated also appreciate<br>the questions that came through from the<br>audience so I'd like to thank our<br>panelists very much<br>thank you<br>all right<br>I'm not sure if I'm leaving a slider in<br>good shape<br>all right uh you've got to once more<br>we're now entering the last session of<br>the day in the last session of the<br>economics Forum so it's the panelists<br>make their way on stage I will uh well<br>we're into geopolitics we're negotiating<br>the seating arrangements<br>um we will uh<br>we will I will introduce our panelists<br>so uh John McKinnon who may be sitting<br>closest to me John McKinnon uh the<br>former New Zealand Diplomat and Senior<br>public servant uh<br>Fran O'Sullivan will be known to many an<br>editorial Director of Business for nzme<br>and Charles Finney partner is Sanders<br>unsworth and former New Zealand Diplomat<br>and you can when you read their<br>biographies and the program you'll see<br>that they all have significant<br>experience here we are somewhat<br>compressed on time so I'll jump straight<br>into this I'm going to start with you<br>John you first went to China or maybe<br>greater China Hong Kong I believe in the<br>early 1970s mid 1970s right correction<br>noted um but do you want to kick off<br>with your your brief comments and then<br>we'll get into the discussion well well<br>thank you Matt keorotato and it's a<br>great pleasure to be here and to have a<br>chance to talk about uh well China<br>mostly but obviously decision is is<br>broader than that as Matt is so<br>sensitively reminded me I did first go<br>to China in the mid-1970s some of you<br>may remember that period of time some of<br>you may not<br>but I want to take you back just a<br>little bit further which is to December<br>1972 50 years ago in December which was<br>where New Zealand established diplomatic<br>relations with the People's Republic of<br>China and I think that it's fair to say<br>that in doing that there was a<br>recognition that it was very hard for<br>New Zealand to operate in the Asia<br>Pacific Regional the indo-pacific region<br>as we often now call it without having<br>some sort of direct relationship with<br>the people in Beijing which had in fact<br>been the fact where there had been no<br>such relationship between 1949 and 19<br>1972. so that was a big part of it now<br>obviously there was also New Zealand<br>being New Zealand a desire that we would<br>benefit economically from that<br>relationship now there were people in<br>Europe who would say if only I could<br>sell one sock to China you know one<br>soccer every person in China I'd be<br>doing well I don't know why they never<br>say two socks but anyway it always seems<br>to be one sock the news equivalent of<br>that was the person in the 1940s who<br>said if only we could sell one pet of<br>butter to each person in China we'd be<br>doing really well well we've come<br>actually quite close to that but that<br>was not the case in 1972 1973 uh in fact<br>it took a while for the economic or<br>commercial benefits of that relationship<br>to make themselves felt and the point I<br>want to make is that at the end of the<br>day it was about the need to have a<br>political relationship with China which<br>drove that decision in 1972 And I think<br>that's still a very valid point now<br>now rolling the clock forward to when I<br>was in Beijing which was in 1978 to 80<br>1978 the end of 1978 was when Deng<br>Xiaoping returned to power in China for<br>about the third or fourth time and he<br>started a new policy a new external<br>policy for China because China had been<br>very conscious over the past 100 years<br>or so that it had been somehow<br>outsmarted by a lot of other countries<br>and it had experimented with many<br>different ways of trying to deal with<br>this but basically dung Xiaoping said<br>well the only way we can deal with this<br>is to integrate China with the rest of<br>the world economically and he set on a<br>path of doing that and that is what we<br>are now seeing today the fruits of that<br>decision which was taken in December<br>1978 although I doubt that even dung<br>shelving himself really realized what<br>this was all going to lead to but one<br>thing it was very clear he did not see<br>it leading to was political<br>liberalization so shortly after the what<br>was called at that time the third plenum<br>which set the new path for China there<br>were demonstrations in Beijing calling<br>for the fifth modernization so the other<br>four modernizations were I think<br>agriculture Industries science<br>technology National Defense the fifth<br>one was to be democracy and dung<br>Xiaoping made it very clear that he was<br>not interested in that in other words he<br>was a not interested in modifying the<br>overarching position that the Communist<br>Party of China has in that polity and<br>it's worth bearing that in mind because<br>that has also continued to be very much<br>a part of what China's been all about<br>since that period of the 1970s but but<br>even before<br>uh dung's policies of course produced an<br>enormous increase in wealth in China<br>people argue now about whether you know<br>basically how many people were lifted<br>out of poverty maybe at 600 million<br>maybe it's 700 million they argue about<br>how many people are in the middle class<br>in China is it 200 million is it 300<br>million well if you're not very sure<br>whether it's 200 or 300 all you do know<br>is it's a lot of people when we think of<br>our own country and our own population<br>uh it's sort of rather dwarfs it from<br>our point of view the significance of<br>that was that a lot of these people were<br>interested in purchasing the goods and<br>services that this country produces so<br>well and to cap that off in 2008 uh we<br>we had the free trade agreement with<br>China which was upgraded last year and<br>it's just about to reach its final<br>conclusion uh on the 1st of January next<br>year and that has also led to a massive<br>increase in the Chinese economic<br>interaction with New Zealand so in 2023<br>we're in a very different world from the<br>world that we started off in in 1972 and<br>one of the other of course huge<br>differences in 2023 compared with 1972<br>as a change in the geopolitics<br>so in 1972 of course this was in the<br>wake of the Nixon Kissinger opening to<br>China A lot of it was about a collective<br>few that other countries including the<br>United States and China wanted to check<br>the Soviet Union<br>now whatever we may say about the<br>situation now it is certainly not that<br>and there are a lot of reasons why<br>things have changed and I don't want to<br>go into those but what I will say is<br>that for a country such as ours it is<br>really very challenging to have a<br>circumstance in which two of our major<br>partner countries the United States and<br>China have limited if not zero trust in<br>each other which means that anything<br>which happens and I'm not an expert on<br>balloons and I don't want to talk about<br>balloons but for anything which happens<br>it's interpreted in the most negative<br>way possible and that I have to say<br>applies on both sides so this is a very<br>tricky situation for a country such as<br>New Zealand because our interests lie in<br>both those places and it's often said<br>that you know we have an economic<br>relationship with China and a security<br>political relationship with the United<br>States I would say it's a little more<br>complicated than that because on the one<br>hand we actually the United States is a<br>big market for us we sell a lot of<br>things there we do very well there on<br>the other hand the Chinese certainly<br>expect a economic relationship to be<br>built on a very sound Foundation of a<br>political relationship so the two are<br>not exactly contrasting if anything they<br>have elements in of a similar kind with<br>one another we have to find a way of<br>working through that and it was just<br>alluded to at the end to the previous<br>session that you know navigating well<br>this is the theme isn't it navigating is<br>is the way we have to go ahead but let's<br>not imagine it's going to be easy and<br>let's not imagine that it's going to uh<br>finish anytime soon I think the<br>circumstance we are looking at<br>geopolitically now is probably going to<br>be with us for a couple of decades at<br>least and we will have to constantly be<br>thinking about how how we manage those<br>things and in terms of our relationship<br>with China there are pluses obviously<br>China is a big big voice in the world<br>and on the region it's a it's a massive<br>market for us there's a big Chinese<br>presence now in New Zealand but they're<br>also obviously areas where we disagree<br>very much uh whether that's things which<br>happen domestically in China or things<br>would happen internationally so finding<br>our way through that is not going to be<br>straightforward but it's a task that we<br>will have to deliver on and we will have<br>to continue doing so for quite some<br>years thank you and a great<br>I guess Zoom back into some of the<br>historical recent historical context as<br>well as the current moment thank you<br>Fran yeah I'm going to um it's a real<br>Cascade of reckons over over today much<br>of which also impinges on China I want<br>to talk about what I perceive right now<br>as sort of an era of new pragmatism in<br>China and we've had you know the period<br>of covert we've had china kind of<br>withdrawing from the world um Xi Jinping<br>who did an amazing amount of<br>international trips as president uh<br>basically stayed home for the best part<br>of three years<br>but now you know at the end of last year<br>once Eden been in door spy the National<br>Congress he'd put in place a clean<br>sweeper the Pollock Bureau brought on to<br>the Pollock Bureau people like one year<br>the foreign affairs minister who is now<br>kind of a super Diplomat right at the<br>center of international Affairs in China<br>and he went ahead he signaled covert was<br>going to be all restrictions lifted the<br>borders were going to come down and this<br>after a very very painstaking period of<br>a very sheltered China it was actually<br>quite a shock at how quickly it has<br>actually moved and we've seen this<br>period with massive acceleration of<br>Interest by investment bankers all sorts<br>of people the Asia Financial Forum up in<br>Hong Kong this year was was deeply<br>deeply optimistic in January about what<br>late<br>but you know what what lied ahead after<br>um you know the period of negativity<br>around China<br>um in our immediate backyard Penny Penny<br>Wong the Foreign Affairs uh Diplomat as<br>from um sorry in October Minister from<br>Australia she managed to get a meeting<br>uh with one year you saw the Albanese<br>government and Beijing start to take<br>very small steps but towards getting to<br>a period where the coercive measures<br>China had taken against uh Australia and<br>largely from a really ridiculous<br>um comment made by Maurice Payne wanting<br>to have a an inquiry into the origins of<br>covert Rush at the time when China was<br>just grappling with the bug itself and<br>so she was the foreign minister things<br>you know became very very difficult New<br>Zealand managed to stir its way around<br>that without getting too far embroiled<br>and so I think we've seen some positives<br>there but it comes against a period uh<br>when in fact if you look at the United<br>States patience has run out with China<br>so at the same time China is starting to<br>tone back the wolf Warrior rhetoric<br>trying to get back out into the world<br>and you know get some sort of resumption<br>of a new normal it's at a time when<br>Ukraine is happening uh you know<br>comments about what's happening with<br>with China's role with Russia and a<br>whole pile of potentially really major<br>retaliatory moves to come out of the<br>United States against China on top of<br>the ones that have already been taken I<br>mean we cozy up to the United States and<br>we talk about the us as being one of the<br>major authors of um you know the peace<br>dividend of the last 30 40 50 years and<br>the international institutions that have<br>you know kind of surrounded that but the<br>United States has been a real<br>recalcitant and we need the United<br>States to step up but at the moment it's<br>not doing that and we have a situation<br>where you know right now it's looking at<br>imposing sanctions more sanctions on<br>China but this time in relation to steps<br>which have yet to be proven about<br>China's role with Russia in Ukraine and<br>the intelligence has not been on that<br>but this I was in<br>um Washington in October and I was<br>absolutely staggered at the<br>um depth of emotion and feeling against<br>China far more so since January 2020<br>which was the last time I was there<br>pre-covered and at that stage they'd<br>done the inflation reduction act<br>underway the trips act underway you know<br>the barriers were coming up U.S was<br>becoming much more industrial policy in<br>its own country but at the same time you<br>go and talk to organizations like the<br>U.S Chamber of Commerce and they said<br>well that's only part of what's likely<br>to happen because they had been briefed<br>by the White House that other sanctions<br>would be considered later and this poses<br>a bit of an issue for New Zealand<br>because the sanctions that we signed up<br>to with Russia were were pretty much<br>cookie cutter sanctions<br>um you know right off the back of the<br>U.S treasury I do not believe that we<br>had the intelligence of this country and<br>capability uh to come up with that list<br>of names and all the um all the issues<br>where they were perceived to have<br>breached various Norms internationally<br>and you know the oligarchs and so forth<br>but if it goes to<br>expansion to be against China and you<br>know where the US goes out and rallies<br>the troops with the G7 then it becomes a<br>question where do we sit and all of that<br>and I think that's a big question and I<br>have no idea what the answer is but it's<br>it scares me frankly<br>thank you friend Charles<br>have a good afternoon and thanks thanks<br>for having me<br>um maybe the best place to begin is just<br>a word of warning uh I have never felt<br>so uncertain about our future in my<br>adult lifetime so normally by now I'd be<br>telling my clients who's going to win<br>the New Zealand election I would be<br>pretty confident knowing where where the<br>U.S politics was heading<br>um I would understand the operation of<br>global financial markets I understand<br>nothing right now nothing is behaving<br>the way it should<br>um and we're in a period of real change<br>in terms of major power relations our<br>friends already alluded to Australia<br>trying to improve relations with China<br>actually I think the Biden<br>Administration wants to improve<br>relations with China too and China wants<br>to improve relations with the Biden<br>Administration but no one knows quite<br>how to do it uh so it's it's a really<br>challenging time to be thinking about<br>the New Zealand China relationship but<br>just on the United States it's amazing<br>that probably the world's most divided<br>politics agrees on one thing absolutely<br>and that is that China is is bad and and<br>um uh that uh China is the threat uh<br>that really complicates life uh for us<br>enormously there are some things that<br>are pretty obvious China is going to<br>remain our Major Market for many years<br>it's interesting uh listening to John's<br>uh reference to the the the uh a pad of<br>butter when I first served in Beijing in<br>1992 it was impossible to get the dairy<br>board interested in the China Market at<br>that point The View was Chinese did not<br>really like dairy products it was never<br>going to be a major Market that had<br>changed actually by the time I'd left<br>China but it was a real Apple battle and<br>the Mead industry said all Chinese<br>people don't like eating sheet meat well<br>in both cases China is by far our<br>biggest dairy market and cheap meat<br>market now so it's very very important<br>to to keep challenge changing those<br>perceptions<br>and on the services side of the equation<br>I think we will see quite a substantial<br>return to International students I just<br>wanted to people be very pleased with<br>that review uh and and and tourists from<br>from from China I think the challenge is<br>actually going to beat our immigration<br>uh settings and getting letting those<br>students back in but we also should be<br>realistic China is not going to be<br>growing as an economy as quickly as we<br>have been used to over the last 20 years<br>its population has begun an inevitable<br>Decline and over the next 50 or 60 years<br>it's going to have<br>uh it's probably going to be per capita<br>terms become much more wealthy but but<br>you know if you're a producer of infant<br>powder and expect a straight line<br>upwards you've got a problem<br>um<br>the um uh Chinese government is also<br>making increasingly loud noises that the<br>Chinese<br>economy needs to be more self-sufficient<br>in the production of a number of<br>products that we are very good at<br>producing and exporting to China and<br>there are some real structural<br>challenges in the Chinese economy we've<br>got a very inefficient soe sector still<br>and there's a property bubble that needs<br>to be addressed<br>we need also to set our relationship<br>settings in the context of those of our<br>major other friends and partners around<br>the world the United States we've been<br>talking about but there's actually very<br>strong views growing in the EU about<br>China that we need to be mindful of UK<br>uh we need to be mindful of and Japan is<br>becoming increasingly independent and<br>assertive in its views and sees China as<br>as a problem needs to be addressed and<br>in China too don't forget that politics<br>is not quite as stable as they would<br>like us to believe but it's very<br>interesting now that Xi Jinping has<br>secured another five years we are seeing<br>a noticeable change in Attitude a slight<br>easing of some of the rhetoric towards<br>the rest of the world and a desire to<br>get out there and and be a bit more open<br>to dialogue with some that they had not<br>been prepared to uh talk to<br>I am really very worried though about<br>this<br>view that's formed in the United States<br>and the view that is growing uh in in<br>significance in other parts of the world<br>about China be being a a real threat and<br>it's all seems to be coming to a head<br>right now around Taiwan and the<br>cross-straight relationships actually<br>that's one thing I'm not really worried<br>about because there is no way China is<br>wanting to invade Taiwan at present and<br>they don't have the capability to do<br>that and they'd be very very worried<br>about the consequences of that act I<br>think that one of the problems we face<br>is that the Chinese have<br>kicked out a whole lot of journalists<br>from China<br>from the US from the UK and in Australia<br>and guess where they've turned up Taipei<br>they're not needing to produce copy and<br>the easiest thing to write about is the<br>crosstalk tensions as we're seeing much<br>more of this in our media and<br>unfortunately we still don't have New<br>Zealand media operating and that<br>critically important part of the world<br>uh for us we're very much getting a a<br>view which is derived from others in<br>that space a lot of the tension you're<br>seeing between China and Taiwan right<br>now is actually not about China and<br>Taiwan it's about China and the<br>Democratic<br>uh Progressive Party in in Taiwan which<br>is in power you're seeing already a<br>dialogue between the kmt leadership and<br>the Chinese government if there's a<br>change of president in in Taiwan in a<br>year and a half's time you'll see a<br>noticeable uh Cooling in in<br>um in the rhetoric and and<br>um uh a change posturing don't forget<br>that China and Taiwan as recently as<br>2012 were negotiating their own Free<br>Trade Agreement uh fell down because of<br>of people flows and services regulations<br>but but they they were doing uh things<br>that people previously thought would be<br>Unthinkable so look we we need to as<br>John has been indicating have as good a<br>possible relationship<br>um and broadly<br>um a broad relationship with China that<br>extends Beyond economics and trade The<br>View that we can just ignore<br>um<br>the things we don't like and just focus<br>on trade and and investment<br>unfortunately is naive and I don't think<br>can be the way we operate in in the<br>future but there are things that that we<br>agree on and there will be things we<br>disagree on we need to have a mature<br>relationship if we disagree with<br>something or we can say it uh if China<br>disagrees with something we do they they<br>can tell us<br>um and we should get used to those<br>differences but we really need to be<br>putting a lot of effort<br>um into<br>looking for those opportunities where we<br>are on the same page I think climate<br>change actually is one where we can work<br>very closely uh together and actually<br>even though they they have broken a few<br>International rules recently in the<br>trade space I think China at the end of<br>the day does believe in the rules<br>rules-based International order and we<br>can uh we can work with them on<br>strengthening that<br>I do worry what would happen if Trump<br>comes back because he is already talking<br>about even more tariffs than he had<br>before and goodness knows what that's<br>going to mean for our situation so as<br>New Zealand business people if there are<br>still some in the room<br>um please<br>take a really close look at what's going<br>on but be very sophisticated in in your<br>analysis it's not a binary thing either<br>or there's a lot of nuance try and<br>understand it and I do think we can<br>navigate our way through by investing a<br>lot more in the relationship<br>thank you<br>um<br>I'm reflecting on the last couple of<br>days and in the session if you were to<br>have sat in this room as a visitor to<br>New Zealand and you were trying to<br>understand New Zealand's position facing<br>out into the world you would quickly<br>realize well actually a lot of politics<br>is domestic and so some of the things we<br>project out into the world are a<br>reflection of the realities many of us<br>have a surface level understanding of<br>China some have a very deep<br>understanding but John I'm going to go<br>to you and then I've got other other<br>questions I'll bring back to Charles and<br>Fran<br>what are we maybe not seeing that's<br>happening within China<br>that would help explain their role in<br>the world they will be less obvious to<br>an audience that understands some<br>Dynamics reads you know where it's a<br>well-informed audience but if we're not<br>close to China Watchers what's actually<br>happening on the inside that leads to<br>those projections so um should I give an<br>hour lecture or just<br>um I mean I think it it is challenging<br>but uh and and Charles actually alluded<br>to some of the challenges which China<br>faces which are demographic which are<br>environmental which are also economic so<br>in some ways getting a realization that<br>China is not immune from the sort of<br>challenges that our societies face is<br>quite important secondly scale I mean<br>you talked about the fact that the<br>population is going to have well it will<br>still be even if it halves and I'm not<br>sure it will harvest to write a bit as<br>that but it would still be 600 million<br>people<br>or possibly 700 million I mean you're<br>still talking about a lot of people and<br>that's possibly something which is<br>rather hard for us to grasp I I used to<br>get into well not trouble in China but<br>uh those of you who've studied Asian<br>languages will know they use the unit of<br>10 000 as the means of counting which<br>means to translate from debt into our<br>form of counting always creates problems<br>so I used to say we have 4.5 million<br>people which we did then and you could<br>see people not he actually means 45<br>million and then I would say and we have<br>27 billion sheep and he would say you'd<br>say he means 2.7 million uh because they<br>couldn't comprehend a country which had<br>4.5 million people and 27 million sheep<br>I mean maybe we can't comprehend it<br>either but but so there are those those<br>differences which are extremely<br>um uh sort of self-evident if you're<br>living in China but not so evident if<br>you're coming from here the final one I<br>would simply mention is the is the role<br>of the of the Communist party I mean we<br>we've as been talked about a lot in the<br>course of the last two days we live in a<br>liberal democracy we have free speech we<br>have freedom of religion we have freedom<br>of all sorts of things it's a very<br>different proposition in China and this<br>is not making a commentary about you<br>know which system is good which isn't it<br>it's just it's part of the reality of<br>China that that party controls uh what<br>happens in that country and it has done<br>so since 1949 so this is not some sort<br>of Flesh in the pan this is something<br>which is deeply embedded in the way<br>China operates and that's an important<br>thing for people to bear in mind when<br>they uh when they move to China and do<br>business there thank you thank you I'm<br>going to um there have been quite a few<br>questions that<br>are coming in that relate to our<br>relationship with China China's<br>relationship with the West which is the<br>center here in our relationship with<br>others I might start with you friend<br>you've just been in the States you<br>talked about that<br>um how realistic is it for us to<br>navigate an independent foreign policy<br>as separate from traditional Airlines oh<br>I think it's absolutely essential I<br>think um when you see the two elephants<br>play you never know when they're going<br>to make up and you can get on the wrong<br>side of things and we have even seen<br>with Australia I think we were quite<br>wise not to go too far down into the<br>Australia you know attempt to fight back<br>against China's coercion because in some<br>ways given the nature of the Beast they<br>kind of provoked it anyway and they had<br>missteps which the current prime<br>minister has acknowledged carefully and<br>that that's you know kind of getting<br>back on the road again I've got to be I<br>think we've got to be careful not to go<br>to a party to which we're not really<br>invited and we need to be very careful<br>about that but at the same time I think<br>we still have to stand up for uh<br>democratic ideals so if there are issues<br>within our own country where we've seen<br>um you know Chinese media uh coming<br>under pressure Chinese<br>um population here we need to stand up<br>for that not to happen and so you know<br>there's there's tension there but but<br>it's interesting I mean I had a very<br>long conversation with two people who<br>came back from China this year having<br>gone back during covert not being able<br>to get back having had aging relatives<br>and in China that they wanted to um you<br>know pay attention to look after out in<br>the provinces and and it was sort of<br>essentially around what are the<br>conversations around China that aren't<br>necessarily at the top of the CCP and<br>all of that but you know in terms of<br>Taiwan which Charles mentioned like what<br>do Chinese really feel about going to<br>war do they really want to lose a<br>million people or so if they go into a<br>war to which they're not military<br>prepared for so people are talking about<br>this uh new maoism do they really want<br>Jay casting the role of a modern mouth<br>you know the kind of invisible hand of<br>the market Guided by the visible hand of<br>government and that that kind of a sin<br>you know syndrome there young people to<br>they want a democratic future or do they<br>want to have a more nationalistic future<br>and the other one uh that same theme<br>that seemed to come through was about<br>business innovators can they actually<br>build a future in China now or will they<br>have to go offshore and the case was<br>made about Jack ma who's been holding<br>out in um in Tokyo because things are<br>not comfortable for him at the moment<br>and he's the founder of Alibaba who had<br>the world's largest IPO pulled by the<br>Chinese government because it was a<br>threat to the financial system so um you<br>know the the boundaries have gone out<br>and some of their business people when<br>you look at<br>um<br>some of the studies coming out of China<br>and the US I mean they are leapfrogging<br>in some elements of Technology the<br>United States and this would have been<br>seen Unthinkable a few years ago so you<br>know there's this Rising power is um is<br>kind of<br>pressing out there but I think we have<br>to treat China with respect I think we<br>have to treat the United States with<br>respect and I would I would hope that as<br>we normalize by getting out into the<br>world seeing each other again you know<br>business missions going back into China<br>from the US as well as New Zealand and<br>everywhere else that we can establish<br>some Norms that take down<br>you know the tension a little bit and I<br>think that's really important<br>thank you I'm going to come to you now<br>Charles is a question that's come<br>through and it was it was General but<br>it's I think particularly applicable<br>you started your comments by saying look<br>it's very hard to know what's going on<br>and yet people come to you for advice on<br>some of these matters what advice do you<br>give given that uncertainty because it's<br>a theme of this conference the world is<br>the world is complex you know saying<br>it's too complex isn't really an option<br>what what advice would you give either<br>to policy makers and politicians or to<br>businesses and how to think about China<br>at this time<br>well in terms of the business business<br>um uh I actually was asked to talk to a<br>quite major International board that was<br>meeting in Auckland uh recently and they<br>were really interested in New Zealand<br>China relations their big question was<br>you know is New Zealand going to be<br>treated the same way Australia has been<br>treated by China are we going to fall<br>into that trap and my advice was I can<br>be very surprised I think there's a huge<br>difference between uh our settings and<br>Australian settings there's no you can't<br>discount the possibility that some<br>politician will say something that China<br>really doesn't like and then they'll<br>whack us around the ears and music using<br>Traders as their mechanism but I I'm<br>reasonably confident that will not not<br>not be the case<br>um<br>and we've talked a lot about<br>um actually the fact that you New<br>Zealand<br>policy makers can't make decisions<br>independent from what's going on<br>um in in The Wider region and and<br>globally and so it's really putting<br>probably much more uh effort into<br>understanding those geopolitical uh<br>tensions uh then we probably are used to<br>as New Zealand boards<br>um and uh if you can't do it in-house<br>nothing you can actually do a lot<br>in-house get that expertise in every six<br>months or every year when you're having<br>your strategy sessions build geopolitics<br>into your into your<br>discussion and and make sure you have a<br>really good<br>risk policy as as a board and you're<br>taking decisions with a full<br>understanding of the risks you're taking<br>I'm pretty comfortable overall with our<br>level of<br>trade dependency on on China but there<br>are certain industries that are very<br>dependent I Hope they've got a plan B<br>and a plan C<br>um<br>one of the plan B plan C options has<br>come through in a question<br>around if uh if China were to align more<br>closely with Russia<br>what then so<br>to any of you would anybody like to<br>greet weight you go you go friend first<br>um and I think and I think the first<br>thing is do we think that's likely let's<br>not you know completely you know well I<br>think China is playing very carefully at<br>the moment because um you know if you<br>look at just uh the rhetoric over the<br>last few days the meeting with the<br>Belarus president and so forth and so on<br>and some sort of indication of wanting<br>to see not quite a peace plan but the<br>first steps toward it<br>and the us obviously feels that doesn't<br>go far enough and they may well be right<br>but um you know but China is sort of not<br>really come out on this issue until<br>about now it doesn't go as far as we're<br>politicians like Jacinda ardern<br>um you know had remonstrated with XI at<br>Apec last year about you know use your<br>influence at um in the UN and Elsewhere<br>on this<br>um you know and they have been allies<br>over a long time so so it's difficult<br>but um you know we'll just have to wait<br>really to see how it how it plays out<br>but I think just um you know I don't I<br>well all bits are off hunted if they um<br>if they do seriously get into bed<br>together<br>then it does come into that question<br>about if it's a major challenge to World<br>Peace where do we sit and you know it's<br>one cynic said to me the other day and<br>it might even have been me<br>um<br>that in some ways you need to have a war<br>to create the new peace dividend and<br>that's a terrible way of looking at it<br>but this is also a view that um you know<br>you kind of here in the United States<br>and some of the think tanks around the<br>hill you hear an element of that coming<br>through on China side as well and<br>Chinese people particularly I think<br>within the Realms of the party uh you<br>know when you talk to people who are On<br>The Fringe of all of that I mean they do<br>actually see this as a potential that<br>there may be you know a major dust up of<br>some sort and then after that the new<br>bones of a new world order might emerge<br>and jump in on this one<br>um I I think that China<br>initially misplayed their position over<br>what Russia was going to do to Ukraine<br>and suddenly realized that they'd made a<br>mistake and have become much more much<br>more careful I think the Chinese view<br>was that the West Was impossibly<br>fractured wouldn't come together uh and<br>that Russia would ROM poem and and take<br>a lot of Ukraine real fast and that<br>hasn't happened and they've learned a<br>lot from that and both in terms of wider<br>diplomacy and international structures<br>but also militarily they're learning<br>lessons all the time I think New Zealand<br>business should be watching what's<br>happening very closely because<br>at the end of the day I I see huge<br>potential for China to be benefiting<br>enormously<br>um from the fact that they're still<br>they're not sectioning they've still got<br>a commercial relationship with Russia<br>they will be investing more in Russia<br>and due course and Russia's got an awful<br>lot of dairy product an awful lot of<br>meat and an awful lot of tree and fish<br>so so we could see China coming out of<br>this with um a very interesting dividend<br>not necessarily peace dividend but a<br>commercial dividend and it wouldn't be<br>necessarily aligning with the interests<br>well I'm going to take refuge on the<br>politicians thing which is I don't<br>answer a hypothetical question<br>but uh but no I mean I think what we I<br>would agree with Fran I think China war<br>is acting very carefully I think this is<br>alluded to earlier in the earlier today<br>and I would imagine it's got very<br>mindful it's set of equities with all<br>sorts of countries over the world<br>including Russia<br>can I zoom right back maybe a for a look<br>at time here the<br>somebody earlier today mentioned the<br>sort of Francis fukuyama there was a<br>view of end of history that most<br>countries are moving towards democracy<br>capitalism this was the drift Samuel<br>Huntington same same time releases Clash<br>of civilizations that no this is not<br>going to work out<br>um Huntington wins for Kiama says yup<br>got it wrong is there is the the simple<br>synthesis but are we looking<br>it actually returned to Norms where<br>we've been in an unusual period of calm<br>Tim grosser at this forum last year<br>talked about Pax Americana there's been<br>a liberal ideology that<br>um has been able system maybe that's<br>been supported by America's wealth and<br>Military might and actually this is more<br>a normal situation where there are<br>vastly different views of the world<br>between superpowers and we should expect<br>that and as a smaller country will be<br>wedged between those elephants at some<br>time join any views well I think I think<br>you've got to be a bit careful not to<br>conflate the current state of affairs<br>with a more permanent shift because<br>there's the world operates differently<br>now from what it did say before World<br>War one I mean we just for instance had<br>the G20 foreign Minister's meeting in<br>Delhi I think it was a few days ago now<br>that that sort of thing you know which<br>put you know is slightly obviously<br>uncomfortable you know interaction<br>between the Russian and the American<br>foreign ministers that could not have<br>happened before and the fact that you've<br>got those sort of Institutions and those<br>sort of Arrangements means that whatever<br>is going on internationally is in a very<br>different space a very different<br>framework from what it was<br>on the on the other point you know about<br>you know where are things hitting I mean<br>and this is perhaps slightly<br>parenthetical to your to your question<br>Matt but I think whatever is going to<br>happen in China will happen because<br>Chinese people want it to happen it<br>won't happen because somebody outside<br>says well we think you're hitting in<br>such and such a direction and therefore<br>in due course you know your political<br>system will catch up with your economic<br>system I just don't think that that's<br>the way it's going to be which is not to<br>say there mightn't be changes but<br>there'll be changes which will be<br>generated internally rather than<br>externally thank you any other views<br>now keep going there are several<br>questions here around<br>trade relationships and one question was<br>that there are obvious a common refrain<br>and board risk sessions and so on as<br>around diversification and there are<br>some obvious limits to that at the at<br>the trade level or downsides and<br>trade-offs on that how might businesses<br>and organizations think about<br>diversification partnership but also<br>maintaining strong and respectful<br>relationships with China can I answer<br>that because I'm going to have to catch<br>another plane in a few seconds<br>um I'll give the upload anyway<br>um I I think the problem is not<br>diversification in the markets we can<br>sell everything we want to sell it's the<br>price that we are receiving and and the<br>problem we face which is a good problem<br>to have right now is that China is<br>prepared to pay top dollar and and we<br>can't match that but it was very<br>interesting in the early stages of<br>covert when we did lose the Chinese<br>market for six weeks or so for certain<br>products we were able to shift pretty<br>quickly Indonesia some other markets uh<br>Sri Lanka took took a lot of dairy<br>unfortunately it's not able to afford<br>that right now if we have to do it again<br>but but<br>um there are other markets there the<br>problem is is is price which is why New<br>Zealand companies should be doing the<br>sensible thing which is trying to<br>maximize returns<br>um but but always have a view to what<br>happens if things go wrong and it's not<br>just a political risk it can be an<br>economic risk and there could be another<br>covert<br>so and and John mentioned uh water<br>before there's a huge problem in China<br>Sometimes some years of a drought<br>um and um that it's got much wider<br>implications anyway I'm sorry I have to<br>go thank you very much no no thank you<br>Charles<br>one of the things that is quite<br>interesting in July New Zealand will<br>host the cptpp commission and that is<br>you know kind of the regulatory body of<br>ministers who get together annually and<br>make sure the comprehensive whatever and<br>whatever the old TPP it was that that's<br>operating<br>um professionally now the United Kingdom<br>is just ready to join that and China and<br>Taipei are also in the queue and so one<br>of the Strategic decisions we have to<br>make is<br>will we as chair help to facilitate that<br>or not and it's really interesting that<br>China is choosing to try and become part<br>of that whereas the US which was one of<br>the originated countries has not done so<br>at the moment Japan which is a bit of a<br>proxy for the us and this debate is<br>basically saying um you know they're not<br>so keen on their prime minister Lee in<br>Singapore is Keen on that he sees it as<br>a way of kind of enveloping uh China in<br>a new kind of you know basically keeping<br>them in the tent and you have to<br>remember also with the regional economic<br>comprehensive partnership China is also<br>part of that so in some ways it is in<br>subclubs and then there's the potential<br>to bring it into another club it also<br>like the United States wants to be part<br>of setting the rules of business for the<br>next little while so there are issues<br>there there's obviously data a whole<br>range of issues but they had the ndrc<br>out here a couple of years ago and they<br>were basically studying what would be<br>the preconditions for China to come into<br>this and would it be an element of<br>modernizing its own economy so you know<br>there's things there which are actually<br>potentially optimistic in the long run<br>I was about to end on exactly that note<br>the word optimism so<br>a last question to both of you before we<br>we close what do you see is the greatest<br>opportunities for us in this<br>relationship as we never get it forward<br>well I think the the greatest<br>opportunity is simply that uh there is<br>going to be continue to be a large group<br>of people in China it may not be quite<br>as large as we thought but a large group<br>of people in China who are interested in<br>purchasing what we want to what we<br>Supply whether that's food whether<br>that's scenery whether that's English<br>language education or whatever<br>and I think that is going to continue to<br>be a key ingredient in New Zealand's<br>economic future now it won't only be<br>China though you know every other<br>country in the world is sort of in this<br>business as well but I would see that as<br>being a place where we should put some<br>effort and by doing so we do need to<br>have a robust political relationship<br>with China at the same time but I think<br>I think we can manage that I mean I said<br>earlier this is going to be a difficult<br>challenge but I do think we can respond<br>um look I I think it is New Zealand<br>continuing to have a voice at the table<br>to develop people-to-people uh<br>connections further than we do and<br>particularly as we are now coming out of<br>covert uh I think the Maori business<br>Community shows extraordinary leadership<br>in this regard<br>um often you know the question comes up<br>and various people Paul Morgan and<br>others are quite vocal have you know<br>kind of asked about what might be<br>happening on human rights in China and<br>says well guys look closer to home in<br>New Zealand what happened to our human<br>rights trade is a great equalizer and I<br>think it's a great way of connecting and<br>when you have um you know commerce<br>between countries it helps to set up the<br>preconditions for peace in my view yeah<br>I agree<br>all right look I will leave it there<br>because I'm conscious that we uh we<br>promised we would get people out at 1 30<br>and so I'm just gonna thank you both and<br>Charles and abstentia for a um you know<br>Hamilton airport Waits for No One and uh<br>for a fantastic session I really<br>all right<br>um before we uh release people out into<br>the the rest of their Friday and on<br>through the weekend<br>um just some brief concluding remarks<br>and I'll actually start with the thank<br>yous<br>um three groups that I want to thank in<br>particular one is the speakers many of<br>you are still in the room I think we<br>have been treated to an exceptional<br>range of views<br>that are real experts on so many topics<br>over the last couple of days and so I<br>just want to acknowledge all of the<br>speakers that have contributed here over<br>the last two days the second group is<br>the staff behind the scenes a little bit<br>less visible than Anna and I or the<br>professors who spoke earlier<br>um who have pulled an event like this<br>together it takes a heck of a lot of<br>work and so I really do appreciate the<br>work of the team The Wider team that's<br>brought this together and the last is<br>all of you because a uh the reason we do<br>this<br>is to have challenging debate<br>conversation all the things we've spoken<br>about which makes uh absolutely not a<br>jot of difference if it's speakers<br>without an audience and this is a<br>wonderful audience I know many of you<br>here many of you have met over the last<br>couple of days and you are people with<br>influence and networks so obviously we<br>ask you to take insights from here share<br>them with your teams the last thought is<br>again finishing on the note of optimism<br>I was uh talking with with Jim on the<br>drive-in this morning and um<br>if you consider some of the topics that<br>we've gone through over the last days<br>the covert response pandemic immigration<br>schools robust public sector<br>infrastructure and housing the political<br>system and election campaigns over<br>dinner uh monetary policy governance and<br>populism democracy at large monetary<br>policy again Crown Maori relations our<br>natural environments and climate change<br>and then China the west and geopolitics<br>one of the greatest themes I picked up<br>when I chatted over a coffee outside is<br>the sheer weight of some of these topics<br>Charles just said it it can feel like<br>everything is uncertain and it is<br>and when we're in this moment<br>that can feel there's a there's an<br>element of exceptionalism somebody<br>yesterday used the term chronological<br>snobbery we can feel that we are in a<br>time that is unprecedented of course we<br>are none of this has happened before but<br>let's just rewind a little bit if you<br>take 40 year block and say from 1980 to<br>2020 yes exceptional change<br>do the experiment take the previous 40<br>years 1940 to 1980.<br>it wasn't exactly calm sailing you've<br>got a nuclear bomb you've got changes in<br>society of women entering the workforce<br>you've got the Cold War try the<br>experiment again 1900 to 1940 you start<br>with horse and cart you end up with<br>Spitfires over Europe and all of the<br>other changes and there keep going back<br>you've got the Industrial Revolution the<br>last several centuries<br>have been full of people chatting in<br>whatever language in whatever conference<br>or Castle saying gosh there's a lot<br>going on<br>and<br>I think in that we should have a degree<br>of humility and also of optimism I don't<br>think that this conference leaves any of<br>us with the impression that it's plain<br>sailing and sunny skies ahead<br>but it should<br>when we look at it in a historical<br>context give us the sense that yes there<br>are very hard choices to be made yes<br>there are trade-offs to be made our<br>ancestors have made those and we will<br>have to they won't be cost-free<br>decisions but we can get through those<br>and<br>pardon me and into better times so I'll<br>leave you with hopefully that uh<br>optimistic thought thanks again to all<br>of you for being here and as we continue<br>to grow The Forum I look forward to<br>seeing uh hopefully all of you and many<br>more next year<br>foreign<br>campus the University of waikato is<br>building an Innovative
