I have received the<br>University of otago's distinguished<br>research medal the New Zealand<br>Association of scientists research medal<br>and the IEEE computer society's<br>outstanding contribution award<br>at least that's what GPT chat gbt wrote<br>about me and of course none of that is<br>actually true but it was a very<br>plausible<br>um summary and I'll pinned that up on my<br>notice board and that's what I'm going<br>to be aiming for from now on okay let me<br>introduce General<br>um in the middle we've got Lex shamanski<br>ARA everyone my name is LEC and I'm a<br>senior lecturer at the computer science<br>department here at the University and my<br>research interests are in machine<br>learning and specifically and deep<br>learning methods and some of my work is<br>building those models and the last one I<br>worked on the last one I worked on was<br>something that had to recognize sheep<br>faces from images but my main interest<br>is theoretical understanding of the way<br>artificial neural networks which power<br>all of the deep learning how they work<br>why they work so well when they do and<br>why sometimes they fail so badly<br>okay thanks LEC and on the end we've got<br>Grant dick uh Kia Ora uh so yes I am an<br>associate professor and head of<br>Department of information science here<br>at the University of otago<br>um I teach in research in the areas of<br>artificial intelligence and evolutionary<br>computation my main focus is in<br>theoretical evolutionary computation but<br>I do put a little bit of emphasis on<br>applied research currently in the area<br>of aquaculture<br>my main interest outside of that in<br>terms of artificial intelligence is more<br>on the application side of things and I<br>tend to approach these things with a<br>skeptical first view shall we say and<br>prove me right or prove me wrong shall<br>we say so hopefully that will inform<br>things as we go along today okay thanks<br>for it and right next to me we've got<br>James McLaren<br>I'm James I'm a philosopher at the<br>University of otago I'm co-director of<br>the University Center for artificial<br>intelligence and public policy and my<br>research focused on AI has been mostly<br>focused on the effect of AI on jobs and<br>work and on government use of AI in<br>aotearoa I'm also a co-author of a book<br>called<br>um<br>a citizen's guide to artificial<br>intelligence okay thanks James and this<br>is our panel all right so um just to<br>give you a quick overview<br>um for this panel session we're going to<br>have each of our panelists give brief<br>outlines of a particular topic related<br>to AI models and then there might be a<br>little bit of interchange from the panel<br>and sort of q a up here and then at the<br>end of the session there should be 10 to<br>20 minutes left over for Q a from the<br>audience<br>um so Lex going to tell us a little bit<br>about the technical overview give us a<br>bit of a technical overview of chat gbt<br>Grant's going to give his uh views on<br>where these AI models are heading and<br>the short medium and long term James are<br>going to chat about what this means for<br>society government and business and the<br>world of work and I'm going to wrap up<br>with some thoughts on what it means for<br>assessment especially at universities<br>um so we'll see how we go okay uh for<br>our first<br>panelist chat over to you Lex tell us<br>how chat GPT Works um thanks Brendan uh<br>right so my job is to explain a little<br>bit uh about what GPT is and how it<br>works<br>um so Chad GPT is a chatbot it generates<br>tax in response to your written queries<br>and the reason why we're talking about<br>it is because it's really really good to<br>the point where we have hard time<br>distinguishing what it produces from<br>Human writing and this is all thanks to<br>an artificial neural network sitting<br>inside chat GPT which has been trained<br>to mimic text patterns from a massive uh<br>make massive data set of documents taken<br>from internet Wikipedia and book<br>repositories<br>but for most users I think the most<br>useful thing to know about is how chat<br>GPT Works after it has been trained and<br>so to explain that I'm going to use an<br>analogy so imagine a device kind of like<br>calculator but with 50 000 buttons on it<br>and each button has a different word so<br>you can punch in any sentence by<br>punching a special correct sequence of<br>buttons and that device also has a<br>predict button so after you punch a<br>sequence of as an input you can press<br>predict and the device will give you the<br>probability distribution of what word<br>should follow and the way it<br>communicates that is by lighting up all<br>the buttons the same buttons that are<br>used to punch in the input sequence with<br>different brightness of light and the<br>brighter the light the more confident<br>the device is that this is a correct<br>word that should follow whatever has<br>been input before<br>and charge GPT essentially operate<br>operates that device for you so when you<br>input a text query charge GPT takes it<br>it punches that that query into the<br>device it presses the predict button<br>um the buttons light up and charge GPT<br>picks one of those buttons at random but<br>um from the few most bright ones punches<br>it again and that gets input that gets<br>added to the input sequence and punches<br>predict again and then the next word<br>comes up the lights change now because<br>the prediction of what follows is<br>different because now the input sequence<br>has been changed and this keeps going on<br>and on in until a special light comes on<br>that says I'm done there's nothing more<br>to generate and chargpt returns all the<br>text to it to you that's essentially how<br>it works and the artificial neural<br>network that sits inside is essentially<br>that device<br>um the last the last few things that I<br>that for the purpose when you when you<br>interact with charge GPT the network has<br>been trained and all the circuitry of<br>that device<br>um are are fixed so it doesn't change as<br>you chat chat with it it doesn't learn<br>anything new and every output is the<br>same given the same input the reason why<br>it generates different text is because<br>it doesn't always pick that brightest<br>button that is the most likely word to<br>follow but it picks a random one from<br>the few brighter ones and the reason why<br>it's so good is because that circuitry<br>is capable of finding partial patterns<br>even in sentences that it hasn't seen<br>before so if there's a new input that it<br>hasn't seen before it can latch on to<br>partial patterns and combine them in<br>interesting ways and produce generate<br>text that we find we find meaningful and<br>often correct and um and that's pretty<br>much it chat GPT is a Marvel of neural<br>network engineering but uh essentially<br>when it operates it's that that's device<br>that just generates text<br>so um a little bit like autocomplete<br>it's essentially like a very<br>sophisticated autocomplete except the<br>autocomplete that we have in our phones<br>uh probably looks at the last few<br>letters that you typed in maybe the<br>previous word this one can look up to<br>2000 words uh of the conversation and<br>from that get the context of um of the<br>conversation so um just to give the<br>audience a little bit of an idea how big<br>is this databases<br>right so um we don't know the exact<br>numbers all these are estimates uh<br>because open AI who made chart GPT<br>didn't release those numbers but it's<br>estimated that the data set of the<br>documents that has been trained on<br>um has had around 500 gigabytes which<br>doesn't sound like a big number but you<br>have to remember that it's all text so<br>the entire English Wikipedia the text of<br>the entire English Wikipedia is about 20<br>Gigabytes so this was 500 gigabytes and<br>um and so<br>um I think it's estimated that to train<br>chat GPT it<br>it had it was passed around 300 billion<br>awards were passed through it<br>right yeah and so to put that in context<br>how many words do we come across right<br>in our lives right so uh yes so we did<br>that to to we did the computation so if<br>um I think uh the computer if I remember<br>the computation correctly if you were<br>processing a word every second for 10<br>hours of your day and so in your entire<br>lifetime you would process about 10<br>million words<br>if I got that correctly so that's sort<br>of the scale<br>and so how so you said chat gp2 is<br>really big how big<br>um so Chad GPT is uh known to have 175<br>um<br>billion parameters<br>which<br>um which might not mean a lot to a lot<br>of people to me it means that it's a<br>really huge neural network that I can<br>run on my computer<br>um and so but we know it took roughly 10<br>000 gpus to train it that's a huge<br>computational power<br>um and so if you if you try and if you<br>try to train chat GPT on your PC it will<br>take about 300 years<br>um but with the 10 000 gpus it took<br>about a month that's the estimate<br>um so that's how big that model is so in<br>terms of what it's supposed to do it's<br>fair to say it's not supposed to give<br>you the truth it's just supposed it's<br>trying to just Converse it's trying to<br>give you likely conversations rather<br>than aiming to give you true<br>conversations it just so happens that it<br>gives you true conversation correct it's<br>it's just fall back falls back on the<br>patterns that it recognized and it's<br>just based on those patterns it predicts<br>what should follow and because it's been<br>the data has been curated very carefully<br>to to make sure that there's uh that<br>this is a useful data and so on and<br>therefore most of the time<br>it will say true thanks but equally well<br>just like in Brendan's bio it can just<br>find patterns that kind of sound like<br>they should be right but they're not<br>okay<br>thanks Lee great where are we going<br>thank you Brendan<br>um<br>the old cliche there's a Danish proverb<br>that is predicting the future is well<br>predicting is difficult especially about<br>the future so I don't know why I<br>volunteered to answer this question but<br>um here we go<br>um as Lex alluded to the these these<br>language models that we're using in<br>these in these domains are<br>um<br>very large and very complex to the point<br>where we know that they work but we<br>don't necessarily know how they work so<br>there's an ongoing research and it'll<br>probably be a a flurry of research in<br>the next 12 months and then going<br>forward around how do we understand<br>these models better okay so that we can<br>remove the the degree of Randomness<br>that's in there or we can understand why<br>certain decisions were made around what<br>words were selected and so forth okay we<br>know enough about them to control them<br>to some degree so that we can control<br>how they're used and how they enter<br>shape the answers they provide but we<br>don't necessarily understand the Deep<br>theoretical under<br>um underpinnings of them these these<br>large neural networks are often<br>engineered not necessarily built up from<br>really deep first principles okay that<br>sounds scarier than it actually is<br>potentially<br>um the other thing that leak alluded to<br>is that there are 175 billion parameters<br>in chat GPT<br>the next model will obviously be even<br>bigger<br>if it's bigger it is going to require<br>more data so it's going to require more<br>than 500 gigabytes of data to to train<br>so that means we're going to need bigger<br>models that are going to require more<br>computation so we're going to be relying<br>on bigger data centers<br>that inevitably has environmental impact<br>these data centers often don't run on<br>renewable sources so we have<br>environmental impact in terms of fuel<br>that's burnt to run these Data Systems<br>and so forth so we need to focus a bit<br>of research and concentration on how to<br>make these things a little bit more<br>energy efficient both in the inference<br>that they're they give and actually in<br>um the next thing that we're going to<br>see and we are already seeing and um<br>we'll probably talk about this quite a<br>bit over the next few minutes<br>is that<br>these Technologies you don't necessarily<br>have to go to chat GPT and do and into<br>your queries in there and take the<br>result and put it into your assignment<br>or put it into your work that you're<br>doing here these Technologies these<br>language models are being integrated<br>into the tools that we use daily okay<br>you're about to see and Bing search the<br>Microsoft search engine actually has<br>released a preview of this now and you<br>can sign up for early adoption you're<br>going to see these tools being<br>integrated into the things that we use<br>day in day out possibly even to the<br>point where it's transparent you don't<br>necessarily fully understand that you're<br>actually using them so from an academic<br>perspective and from a from various<br>other perspectives we need to think<br>about how we actually embrace that okay<br>we can't even necessarily assume that a<br>a student if they're going to plagiarize<br>for example is doing this this honestly<br>if they are using those legitimate tools<br>out there they may be honestly using<br>these these techniques and not<br>necessarily realizing it so we need to<br>um I guess the last thing I want to say<br>is that I'm going to make a really bold<br>prediction here 12 months from now we<br>won't be talking about chat GPT okay the<br>the hype will have moved on we will<br>understand it a lot better and the the<br>fear and the uncertainty will have moved<br>to something else that we're using Okay<br>um we're going to have various<br>techniques that are going to make it<br>clearer that<br>these sources of text that are going to<br>be generated from chat GPT or various<br>other language models because there's<br>quite a lot of work going into<br>watermarking them and understanding that<br>the the particular sequence that they<br>generate to make it clear that it's it's<br>come from a language model<br>now that's not necessarily done for an<br>academic benefit or anything anything<br>that we may be concerned about the<br>companies that build these models are<br>actually concerned about it for the very<br>specific reason that they don't want to<br>train their models on<br>language model generated text because<br>it's kind of not really expanding its<br>Horizon to be learning on it on its own<br>regurgitations basically so they've got<br>a vested interest in producing it now we<br>may be able to leverage that or it may<br>be that we just don't worry about it too<br>much and we we focus on embracing these<br>Technologies a little bit more than<br>um fearing them and thinking they're<br>going to be the end of the way that we<br>teach<br>I think we'll leave it there so um when<br>is chat GPT going to arrive in Microsoft<br>Word<br>well Office 365 does have a fairly rapid<br>turnaround in terms of product updates<br>and that sort of thing so<br>if we all remember clippy I wouldn't<br>mind it would I wouldn't I wouldn't<br>expect a I wouldn't expect a chat GPD<br>very end of clippy six months from now<br>but if you're on a preview release I<br>wouldn't be too uh I don't think it'd be<br>too far to say 12 months from now you'll<br>be seeing these kind of kind of<br>Technologies embraced in there there is<br>a demo of uh chat GPT or something like<br>I presume it's jet GPT working with<br>Excel yes where you can say just an<br>ordinary speech strip out this from<br>these cells and do this computational<br>and it will then generate the formula<br>that it pops in the cells so that's yeah<br>that's coming yeah<br>but in terms of every day and day in day<br>out release still a wee while away yet<br>yeah<br>okay thanks James<br>uh okay so I want to talk about our work<br>and knowledge and Humanity let's aim<br>high<br>okay so we'll kick off with work so the<br>large language models that sit under<br>things like chat gbt that lek was<br>talking about uh classic examples of<br>general purpose Technologies and other<br>examples of general purpose technology<br>are things like electricity and the<br>production line and telephony so they're<br>technologies that have an extraordinary<br>breadth of application that are very<br>very disruptive commercially that will<br>have big effects on the way that people<br>live and work I agree it's not going to<br>check GPT next year but it'll be<br>something else it'll be the descendants<br>of so we're going to get lots of change<br>we're going to have our students trying<br>to work out having a laser focus on what<br>sort of skills they think they need now<br>in this world with this sort of<br>technology in it and we're going to have<br>to<br>try and help them try and work out you<br>know what those skills are and how we<br>can provide those skills for them<br>when people think about technology<br>change large-scale technology change<br>they immediately think about<br>technological unemployment and that's<br>the term that's invented by John Lennon<br>Keynes The Economist writing in 1930 and<br>Keen says that<br>technological unemployment is always a<br>temporary phase of adjustment when you<br>go from an old technology to a new<br>technology now there's always debate<br>about it but that's 1930 we've had a lot<br>of automation<br>from then to now we still haven't seen<br>large-scale structural unemployment in<br>countries like ours what we do see is<br>massive change in the jobs that we do<br>differences in the skills required for<br>particular jobs the number of people<br>doing particular jobs obviously new jobs<br>are rising who knew what prompt<br>engineering was last year now suddenly<br>it's a job<br>um<br>with all that you get a lot of change in<br>the value of jobs that is output by that<br>so to give you a really old-fashioned<br>example 1922 the Ford Motor Company<br>invents the moving production line and<br>suddenly they can pump out Model T Fords<br>three times as fast but they do so with<br>a Workforce that's largely unskilled<br>they don't need anything like as many<br>Engineers or mechanics you just need<br>people who can do one job on a<br>production line<br>Satya Nadella the current boss of<br>Microsoft says that chat GPT is going to<br>lower barriers to knowledge work that<br>sounds good I like a low barrier but if<br>you think a little bit about what's<br>being said here you know what's being<br>said is that some of the knowledge<br>skills we have now are going to be less<br>important less valuable in future that's<br>his prediction is chat GPT going to make<br>us less knowledgeable uh let's go to<br>ancient Greece why not so Plato very<br>worried about new technologies that he<br>thinks will make wise sorry foolish<br>people look wise and the technology<br>Plato's really worried about is writing<br>because in the past if you knew it it<br>was up here and now all of a sudden you<br>could know things that were out there<br>and the long history of knowledge<br>innovation has been a history of us<br>getting better at having knowledge<br>that's out there<br>putting it out there retrieving it<br>searching it manipulating it<br>so<br>in general what<br>this penalty of change has achieved is<br>better retrieval of knowledge by more<br>people so a democratization of knowledge<br>people having more opportunity to learn<br>more about more things<br>generally successfully so we all know<br>what the issues are or what lots of the<br>issues are here so there's bias and<br>accuracy all those sorts of things it's<br>worth knowing that chat GPT has what's<br>called a trust and safety layer built<br>into it so that's a layer that's built<br>by the people who make the chat GPT<br>that's making a decision about what sort<br>of things chat gbt wouldn't talk to us<br>about and what sort of things it would<br>talk to us about it so it's curated a<br>little bit like the way that your<br>Facebook feed is curated by an algorithm<br>all right Humanity last up people are<br>really excited about the fact that this<br>seems so human in what it can do and<br>there are people who've claimed that you<br>know some of these models are conscious<br>that they have beliefs but the flip side<br>is people who say it's an algorithm it<br>doesn't know things you know under the<br>hood it's just matrix multiplication it<br>knowledge<br>belief desire autonomy<br>moral characteristics moral agency moral<br>patency<br>they're complex and contested ideas but<br>it's worth knowing that a lot of the<br>theory in this space is what<br>philosophers call thin so to give you an<br>example here's here's a common way of<br>thinking about belief my beliefs are<br>nothing more sorry my belief that<br>there's milk in the fridge is nothing<br>more than my tendency to go to the<br>fridge when I need milk it's just a<br>disposition it's whatever in me makes<br>that true that's a low bar that's the<br>sort of bar that jet GPT could meet now<br>I'm not saying Tech GPT is conscious or<br>as a person or anything like this<br>there is going to be a lot of great fun<br>fascinating philosophical debate about<br>these things I think it's easy to get<br>distracted by these issues and lose<br>sight of the big thing which is what<br>check GPT can do for us so one last<br>example and I'll start so we live in a<br>world where people live longer much<br>longer and a consequence of that is an<br>epidemic of loneliness<br>around the world millions of people who<br>have full companionship a pet or the<br>radio or the TV which can't engage with<br>them which can't answer their questions<br>can't help them isn't on their side<br>things like chat GPT could be<br>extraordinarily valuable to vast numbers<br>of people so they're here to stay<br>okay thanks James<br>um I think one thing just to pull all of<br>that together to make sure everybody is<br>aware chat gbt and tools like it are an<br>example of what's known as narrow AI so<br>this is AI that's very good at a<br>specific problem and we've got lots of<br>examples where narrow AI is<br>absolutely excellent and often better<br>than humans but only in very very narrow<br>fields and chat GPT is an example of<br>that so it doesn't reason right it<br>doesn't do reasoning like we think of<br>reasoning<br>uh what's reasoning<br>so it's it's manipulating ideas it can<br>do inference so if I if I'm good at<br>prompting I can say imagine you're a<br>philosophical logician and you want to<br>analyze this argument and it can analyze<br>the argument in the way that a logician<br>would analyze the argument so it can<br>mechanically do what we're doing when<br>we're doing things like reasoning<br>whether we want to call it reasoning<br>well I can recommend lots of philosophy<br>courses that you could take that might<br>help but it's just not it's not a simple<br>question it really isn't well lack right<br>quite a controversial statement from<br>James I think I think a very bold<br>statement<br>um it is I I agree that it's an<br>application of narrow AI it's a very<br>useful application of our AI I think<br>personally if it was able to reason<br>um it would<br>if you look at brynden's profile about<br>um member of Royal Society and that's<br>the thing it would know that this is a<br>fabrication and so we go am I going to<br>get this through<br>um you know so I I think that it's a<br>clear demonstration that it is<br>very useful probability distributions<br>that present uh<br>present an image of intelligence<br>one of the things with working out<br>whether artificial intelligence is smart<br>is what standards are that you use so if<br>you want to assess whether an automatic<br>an automated vehicle is you know is<br>doing a good job one thing that people<br>get excited very excited about is it<br>made a mistake that a person wouldn't<br>make<br>so when it screws up it doesn't screw up<br>in the same way that we screw up but<br>actually what matters is the road toll<br>we care about how much it screws up now<br>you know these things are going to screw<br>up in ways that we don't screw up the<br>question is you know are they smarter<br>than my Twitter feed I don't know<br>there's something to my Twitter feed<br>that look pretty weird<br>um a reason to think<br>that I guess we should be skeptical and<br>then another reason to think the other<br>way so some people say we should be<br>skeptical because when I reason about<br>you know the mass of this class what<br>it'll do if I touch it some something<br>like that my beliefs come from<br>perceptions that I have of things like<br>that I'm connected with things like that<br>you know reasonably well so they're<br>grounded in the real world except that I<br>can talk about plesiosaurs and think<br>I've never seen a pleasure saw some<br>people have evidence for plesiosaur<br>they write it down it gets to me<br>eventually so I do something that<br>philosophers call<br>reference borrowing now a way to think<br>about what chat GPT is doing is that it<br>only borrows reference because it<br>doesn't have any connection with the<br>real world until somebody puts it inside<br>a robot<br>and I've just read a paper where<br>somebody's done that<br>um but uh okay I think we'll leave that<br>discussion that we otherwise we'll be<br>here all day<br>um so thanks James thanks the panel so<br>um I just wanted to briefly talk about<br>what this means for assessment<br>at University especially and so I think<br>um so the generative language cat is out<br>of the bag and we're not putting it back<br>in So students will use this these tools<br>whether we like it or not so even if you<br>have an assignment that explicitly says<br>You must not use chat gbt<br>um there's going to be<br>some percentage of students and this<br>would probably get higher as things go<br>on who will in fact use chat GPT so<br>trying to get around not using chat gbt<br>is<br>effectively a lost cause for those sorts<br>of Assessments where we send students<br>away they can go and do them at home for<br>example this is not true so if you want<br>to actually make sure that a student is<br>writing the thing that you're seeing now<br>then it has to be some sort of<br>invigilated assessment so an exam an<br>in-class test an oral presentation<br>things like that<br>um I know Grant talked briefly about<br>that there will upcoming there'll be<br>tools and there are some tools out there<br>now that can<br>um detect with certain amount of<br>um success whether a piece of tax was<br>generated by chat GPT or not<br>um I don't think these things can be<br>trusted so they're<br>in fact this is often a way that the<br>training of these sorts of models happen<br>there's a trade there's a competition<br>going on between the generator and a<br>discriminator right and so you end up in<br>an arms race and eventually<br>um chat gbt or similar will become so<br>good to be completely indistinguishable<br>so<br>unless they explicitly put in things<br>like watermarks from the start and we're<br>not going to be able to tell so what<br>does that mean<br>um so I think what it means that we're<br>going to have to think extremely<br>carefully and this will be very<br>discipline specific about what is the<br>knowledge and the skills that the<br>students need to have in their heads and<br>what other Knowledge and Skills that<br>students don't need to have in their<br>heads but just need to be able to find<br>somehow and that's the key distinction<br>so if you're learning a language clearly<br>you need to have<br>vocabulary and grammar in your head<br>otherwise you're not going to be able to<br>speak you know no good getting chat gbt<br>to<br>um to generate it offline although maybe<br>we'll get a Babel Fish at some point and<br>it won't matter but aside from that<br>um<br>quite often there's suggestions that<br>questions that focus on higher order<br>thinking or analysis are thought of as<br>good questions<br>I suggest you try any of those questions<br>out with chat GPT or similar if you have<br>those in my experience chat GPT is<br>pretty good at doing answering those<br>sorts of questions at an undergraduate<br>level<br>at the sort of level that we expect our<br>undergraduates to be thinking about so I<br>think one of the the really good tips is<br>if you have an assessment question where<br>a student can go home and do the<br>assessment then have passed that<br>question through chat gbt just to see<br>what sort of answers it can give you<br>um and generally It generally it's<br>pretty good at answering well-known<br>facts and doing sort of well-known<br>analysis it's not necessarily very<br>accurate at choosing citations and<br>things like that so sometimes it gets<br>those those completely wrong so a couple<br>of other suggestions and I thank Lee<br>Adam for providing a document about this<br>which she's circulated around the<br>university already but setting<br>assignments that require feedback from<br>the teacher so you set an assignment<br>they have to submit something you<br>provide feedback they submit something<br>else based on that I think that's one<br>good way if you design personal<br>Reflections into your assessments<br>um although chat GPT can generate these<br>two<br>so they need to be personal uh<br>Reflections that you sort of know<br>something about the um<br>experience of the student and also<br>referring to material that's not easily<br>available on the internet so things that<br>you discuss in class or have in your<br>lecture notes for example<br>um<br>okay so I think<br>um<br>I think we're good we're ready to take<br>some questions from the audience if<br>yes<br>um just uh<br>from the healthcare perspective of this<br>there's a few scientists who first when<br>they saw chapter TTP or what should we<br>what should we try and do with it let's<br>see if we can pass the United States<br>medical licensing exam and it did so<br>there's a question of you know is this<br>thing gonna<br>replace the professionals we go to for<br>knowledge<br>quicker than we are expecting it's going<br>to<br>um oh does anyone want to take have a<br> ever I have an opinion but um<br>economists distinguish between enabling<br>and replacing Technologies so my laptop<br>enables me and the checkout machine<br>replaces a checkout operator in a<br>supermarket in reality automation like<br>this is always a mix of both those<br>things so it might be that in future we<br>don't need as many GPS but the GPS we<br>have have very whiz-bang technology at<br>their sides that allow them to be much<br>more reliable at giving you a diagnosis<br>sorry that's not much of an answer but<br>yeah so sorry just the just so we have<br>the question okay thanks Richard the<br>question was about<br>um<br>whether things like jet cheap BT are<br>going to replace<br>um professional people whether that's in<br>healthcare or similar rather quicker<br>more quickly than we think might happen<br>yeah<br>um I think probably not I think it will<br>be used as a tool by the professionals I<br>mean Society moves relatively slowly<br>you know I think if you if you take that<br>specific example of passing the exam<br>that's demonstrating an exam as in many<br>cases including those kind of<br>professions an example of<br>um regurgitating fact you know it's not<br>uh it's not a you know in an exam<br>environment there's not going to be a<br>lot of diagnosis kind of work going on<br>and so forth so yeah these are these are<br>technologies that would support those<br>people in those places and I think<br>that's actually an important part of of<br>what we do in Academia now is as Brendan<br>alluded to and I alluded to we have code<br>generators now that will work on these<br>with these language models the code they<br>generate is 98 right you know but it'll<br>be on those edge cases where it's wrong<br>and what we need to be training is not<br>necessarily how to write code but in<br>some ways how to recognize when code is<br>wrong or how to work through that<br>process of refining that code that gets<br>generated to make it work again and um<br>you know again it's an example of<br>augmenting our abilities in the<br>professions that we choose yeah and I<br>think it's important in that yeah that's<br>a good example I think of what we think<br>as one of the skills that a student must<br>have so in our discipline they must be<br>able to program otherwise you can't call<br>yourself really a computer scientist or<br>an information scientist and having a<br>you know a program generated<br>doesn't really help because you won't be<br>able to recognize when it goes wrong and<br>I've got a couple of questions from<br>um the zoom or wherever it's coming from<br>The Ether<br>um<br>that um<br>talking about non-stem<br>disciplines like Humanities Etc so what<br>skills essentially do we think students<br>will need to be able to make effective<br>use of these chat bots so how how can we<br>prepare our students for using these<br>tools wisely so what is it we need to do<br>because guarantee they're going to be<br>using these assuming there's no robot<br>apocalypse in their working lives<br>anyone so in the humanities<br>um actually I don't really think it's a<br>different answer to the humanities for<br>for everybody else I mean prompt<br>engineering is going to become a huge<br>thing yeah what is problem so<br>understanding how to interact with<br>something like chat GPT people who use<br>this for the first time put in a<br>question like an exam question if it<br>doesn't get it right they go it's bust<br>it's like you buy a hammer well the nail<br>didn't go in this Hammer's broken<br>um you know there's a skill to it so you<br>need to tell it what domain it's in you<br>need to tell it what expertise you want<br>it to have you can tell it you know<br>answer this at 11 that a 10 year old<br>would understand so you know that<br>ability to make it give you the<br>information you want you can tell it to<br>expand on things to to leave some stuff<br>out so that kind of prompt engineering I<br>think is going to be really important I<br>think the bigger question for us is you<br>know what's what's the thing that people<br>who do our jobs how have to be able to<br>do so philosophers have to be able to do<br>logic people in the humanity action<br>people everywhere in universities have<br>to be able to think critically and<br>critical thinking is the thing that it's<br>growing up when it's getting Brendan<br>wrong and saying you know he's probably<br>King of the Universe I mean you could be<br>I'm sorry Brendan but<br>um<br>so critical to that ability to think<br>about how people would disagree with<br>what you're saying and what you would<br>say to them that it's the Nuance it's<br>that sort of thing maybe it will<br>there'll be a point where it can do that<br>but for now that's the thing we need to<br>have so we can tell when it's getting<br>things wrong and use it more effectively<br>yeah so uh one uh sort of question here<br>was what about asking students to use<br>chat GPD and then analyze its response I<br>think they're excellent sort of um thank<br>you<br>thank you questions do we have any other<br>questions yeah<br>um<br>I'm amazed about<br>um<br>different languages<br>so first I thought it's just the main<br>about the bigger languages it does but<br>it does even languages that Google<br>translate just doesn't get really right<br>so it's really good at translating<br>so I asked jtbt I was interested to know<br>if it has been trained other languages<br>or if they're just translated into<br>English<br>and it gave me<br>a long list of languages which I thought<br>this is great because actually it's not<br>just all languages going through English<br>being that big monoculture of English<br>but it's actually drawing from different<br>cultures and my colleague in Japan put<br>in exactly the same question and she got<br>us an answer it's only English<br>so that's interesting because it was the<br>same prompt so it was interesting what<br>you said but I was wondering if you had<br>any between those two extremes of<br>answers if you had so what is the Corpus<br>on I mean is it a multilingual Corpus or<br>is it just English and all the languages<br>being through the lens of English I<br>think it's so can I just make sure is it<br>being captured<br>I'm sorry yeah so I I think it's trained<br>on uh multi-language Corpus and I think<br>so as far as I know Chad GTP doesn't<br>have translation or anything like that<br>in it<br>I think charge DP has a map engine now<br>that it recognizes a mathematical<br>formulas and something else handles it<br>and not the language model but as far as<br>language so when I gave that device I<br>made I simplify things I said one<br>buttons award in in fact chat GPT has<br>um fraction of text<br>um on those buttons so putting the<br>stacks together it can make up pretty<br>much anywhere there's out there<br>including uh weird characters from weird<br>languages and so for instance um I tried<br>uh polish and um I I looked how it uh<br>how it tokenizes the sentence and it<br>doesn't go by words it's just<br>a couple of letters three letters at a<br>time and that gets translated into<br>numbers and ultimately Chad GPT just<br>works with numbers and it just<br>recognizes those patterns what is<br>amazing about some of the internals is<br>that those numbers also chat that neural<br>network<br>push makes those numbers in a way as it<br>represents them internally that there's<br>relationships so<br>um<br>it has this representation that numbers<br>for the same concept in different<br>languages sorry for for the same concept<br>coming from different different text uh<br>will sort of be pushed to the same point<br>in their in the representation so it can<br>represent the same concept in any<br>language it's just whatever the context<br>comes in it just chooses the same<br>context to come out but it's it's same<br>mechanism and uh from Chachi Pete's<br>point of view it doesn't really matter<br>how it comes out and it takes the cue<br>from your prompt how it has to come out<br>but it's uh it's an internal<br>representation it's it's done in a way<br>that it's it's<br>words regardless of the language sort of<br>fall to the same Concepts internally and<br>therefore it can it can generate<br>patterns even if it learns pattern in<br>English if the prompt is in Polish it<br>can<br>use the pattern from English and output<br>polish sentence<br>okay<br>thanks a question from The Ether so how<br>do we ensure that students are not<br>falsely accused of using chat gbt as<br>there is no way to prove it yet<br>so I think a simple answer to that is we<br>need to design assessments so that even<br>if they use chat GPT it's not academic<br>misconduct I mean that really the only<br>either we design them so that it's<br>impossible to use chat ghbt or we have<br>an assessment we're using chat GPT is<br>okay I mean I don't I think I'll just<br>add on to that what I said before about<br>um we will we will reach a point where<br>students May genuinely not know that<br>they're using these tools okay so it's<br>um you know we we have to move on from a<br>point of accusation to a point of yeah<br>genuinely you know they're not falsely<br>using them they're not honestly using<br>them they're they're just part of their<br>Arsenal and Suite of things that they<br>use yeah so similar to like a spell<br>check or a grammar checker nobody says<br>now oh you've obviously used a grammar<br>checker on that scent exactly um you've<br>you've done academic misconduct right so<br>it's going to be it's I think that the<br>tool itself is in a similar category<br>well it might end up being like<br>something like calculators where we just<br>assume people have access to them and<br>it's absolutely fine but there might be<br>contexts in which we say sure you know<br>for kids at school you can't use a<br>calculator in an app so that's so it<br>might be that yeah yeah yeah exactly and<br>for those particular cases we have very<br>specific types of invigilation there<br>yeah yeah so you know we don't go walk<br>behind the walk behind the corridor and<br>behind the wall there and do the<br>equations we say do it on the Whiteboard<br>or whatever they say<br>um so we'd have to do something similar<br>there if it's something that's<br>absolutely critical that right there<br>right now you have to demonstrate<br>knowledge of something then it may be<br>our own solution only solution is in<br>person and vigilation yeah and there's<br>ways around that absolutely yeah uh a<br>hello<br>um so six years ago there was a<br>documentary called alphago maybe some<br>people in the audience stand up there<br>are familiar<br>um for those who aren't familiar the<br>premise was there was a machine learning<br>built to play the game of Go and they<br>demonstrated this tool at a championship<br>where they had the world champion and go<br>play five rounds and the Machine<br>learning beat the world champion I think<br>four out of the five games that were<br>played so part of what I took away from<br>that documentary was the chat or the<br>sorry not chat gbt the model alphago was<br>playing the game in a way that was<br>different than how they'd notice people<br>play over all these however many years<br>hundreds of years they've been playing<br>the game of Go so for you experts<br>um what sorts of areas are you excited<br>to see<br>these predictive models move into that<br>might teach us things that we don't<br>previously know or methods that we're<br>not previously using whether it's<br>language or other areas is there<br>anything that excites you in particular<br>about Illuminating new new uh methods I<br>guess<br>well not not to sorry not to not to pair<br>it back but game playing is exactly that<br>serious scenario where things are quite<br>fascinating we we talk about the classic<br>thing is a chess Grandmaster we always<br>you know interview a chest Grandmaster<br>and say how do you play chess they won't<br>even be able to tell you themselves how<br>they play chess but these these upcoming<br>Technologies may actually uncover<br>strategies that they use may be able to<br>mimic the behaviors of them and<br>increasingly when we're moving towards<br>looking at things like explainable AI we<br>may actually start to uncover what those<br>strategies are and be able to actually<br>codify what those those that knowledge<br>is that there's very much tested<br>knowledge to those experts so I see that<br>as being one place where we progress it<br>game playing<br>um and yeah a lot of a lot of activities<br>that we do as humans we we flat out just<br>don't know why we do it or how we do it<br>and it's those places that we can you<br>know driving for example<br>um you know James alluded to the fact<br>that you know we might be able to make<br>ourselves safer at driving<br>half the time I am on autopilot when I'm<br>driving home I something's going on<br>something's happening I'm turning I'm<br>indicating and that sort of thing pretty<br>much instinctually maybe there's<br>something in there that these AI<br>techniques can use to help us understand<br>my personal behavior of as a as an agent<br>in this world<br>for me anywhere where there are really<br>complex patterns where it's very hard to<br>do the science often because it's very<br>hard to do experiment medical diagnosis<br>is going to be something like that but<br>also things like economics where you<br>just can't experiment on whole economies<br>so it's a very multifactorial systems I<br>think we'll learn a lot I have two areas<br>that I'm particularly excited about one<br>is the science and engineering area I<br>think and<br>so we've recently had protein folding<br>which was using an alphago-like<br>uh<br>AI which has moved things along<br>quite significantly in the protein<br>folding space but I think in Material<br>Science and various other things like<br>that for Designing things where you just<br>need<br>so much knowledge to be able to<br>successfully do it that it's hard to fit<br>it all in your head so that's one thing<br>the other thing is I very much look<br>forward to the day when chat gbt or<br>similar can fill out all the forms that<br>I have to fill out<br>if I can do that I'd be very happy so<br>yeah I just wanted to add that I don't<br>think charge GPT itself is gonna produce<br>something creative or awesome because<br>it's been really trained as a predictor<br>so I use it when I program it helps me<br>program and I was curious if it's gonna<br>write a program that I wouldn't thought<br>of and it's really good at predicting<br>what I would do next but it doesn't<br>really write new stuff the reason what<br>alphago play differently is because it<br>was trained just to play it wasn't tell<br>how and it figured out slightly<br>differently than the humans Play This<br>One charging PT at the moment the<br>technology might change but at the<br>moment it's just trained it's called<br>statistical parent it's just trained to<br>mimic the patterns that it sees but uh<br>suddenly change in the future<br>okay so I'll just say one last thing the<br>other thing that I think is actually<br>great about these things that are coming<br>out is<br>every single problem that we solve<br>is a demonstration it helps us to Define<br>what intelligence actually means as<br>humans like there are lots of things<br>when I was a kid anybody who could solve<br>a Rubik's Cube was unbelievable smartest<br>smartest kid in the class until five or<br>six years later you realize there's an<br>algorithm behind it and you can you know<br>you watch the videos where people are<br>doing it blindfolded or you know behind<br>their back or whatever and you go oh<br>that's not a definition of intelligence<br>so it helps us to parameterize you know<br>contain what are the things that<br>actually Define us as intelligent beings<br>and you know in these these day-to-day<br>tasks that we often<br>cherishes like examples of immense<br>intelligence it allows us to to move<br>around them and go oh actually there's a<br>real clear pattern to how we actually<br>solve those problems and and then we can<br>really concentrate on what makes us more<br>human to some degree Probably sounds a<br>bit lofty in this thing but that's where<br>I see these things actually really<br>helping so<br>I've got a couple more questions<br>um from The Ether<br>um<br>it's a couple of them are very<br>complicated and would take a long time<br>to answer so we might have a brief<br>afterwards where we record a couple of<br>things uh here's one uh it says we're<br>focusing on teaching but are there some<br>very powerful AI tools for us as<br>researchers<br>any comments I know of at least one<br>colleague who's writing their papers<br>through chat GPT<br>in a positive way I should say that in a<br>very positive way<br>um using to stimulate how to write a<br>particular section so you know the<br>office obviously when we write papers<br>we've got page constraints we've got<br>style constraints to adhere to a journal<br>and something and they're using this to<br>support their writing so they're not<br>they're not doing the the experiments or<br>anything like that but they are<br>absolutely using it to help them write<br>their reports and that sort of thing<br>yeah I mean there's been a cup so<br>with check gbt itself there's been a<br>couple of experiments that people have<br>done like just anecdotal experiments<br>where they tried to do a review of<br>um some scientific literature or<br>something like that and it hasn't really<br>worked matter if you know Facebook<br>tried to release a chat bot that was<br>trained on a just a whole bunch of<br>scientific literature and people very<br>quickly broke it and got it to produce<br>made up citations and stuff it may get<br>better<br>um I think it'll probably get better on<br>provenance yeah I mean there's an<br>interesting problem here if you give a<br>student five things to read and then say<br>write an essay then everything in the<br>essay you can say which things it come<br>from because they've only read five<br>things these things read millions of<br>things so in a sense there isn't a fact<br>of the matter about where something came<br>from it so in provenance what you're<br>kind of saying is could you find a<br>reference that says what I just said<br>it's not where did this come from so<br>it's just yeah it's a challenging<br>problem<br>there's also other areas where for<br>example<br>um if you think about machine learning<br>itself the application of machine<br>learning is often very fraught with<br>um<br>tuning of parameters to make them the<br>models fit better to the data you've got<br>and<br>um I know of at least one case here<br>where somebody actually used check gbt<br>on some rather complex modeling to<br>actually say help me I'm struggling with<br>the modeling of of this particular<br>approach and chat GPT was able to<br>sort of interact and help with them to<br>actually do that hyper parameter tuning<br>so you know the again saving them<br>having to read swathes of textbooks on<br>you know this particular parameter on<br>this particular paper for this<br>particular problem having to digest all<br>that synthesizer it's brought down so<br>they can actually solve the problem<br>they're trying to solve right now so so<br>there's productivity it's really good<br>for General explanation if you like I<br>work in a very interdisciplinary area<br>and I'm constantly talking to these<br>people and lawyers and economists and I<br>need an explanation of this idea that<br>I've just heard somebody explain it I<br>don't want a technical explanation but I<br>need it pretty accurate and I need<br>pretty good detail brilliant for that so<br>helpful for that sort of thing it's<br>really good at summary so you can give<br>it a piece of text and just give me a<br>summary and it's really good at fishing<br>out all the information and you can be<br>pretty sure that it's mostly correct<br>because it's just summarizing the text<br>yeah what differences how does this one<br>differ from that one it's good at that<br>too yeah and and this comes back to<br>um how do we teach our students to be<br>better users of it and as researchers<br>how do we better to at it<br>um you know we we when we look at things<br>that you know we put into EBT and so<br>forth that we are experts and we can do<br>a pretty good sniff test on on that on<br>that summary that comes back I was like<br>oh no that doesn't make sense because in<br>my domain that that just sounds really<br>weird<br>um so it's good for getting<br>into a new environment getting a quick<br>summary of where we are but actually<br>again if we've got the skills to do that<br>sniff test and go well that seems a bit<br>out of character and being able to<br>validate and verify it through other<br>means it's a real Boon for productivity<br>it really does help to you know sit you<br>know really compact down what we<br>actually have to focus on and in terms<br>of learning a new domain or a new<br>application so on I just got one<br>this is a bug bear of mine so I'm gonna<br>highlight it from um from The Ether so<br>if in person and vigilation remains key<br>for maintaining academic Integrity for<br>assessments does this indirectly reply<br>imply that the University of Togo should<br>invest more in facilities for online<br>digital in-person and vigilated<br>assessments or should we stick to paper<br>and pencil so I'm not sure so for online<br>in general absolutely not it's doomed<br>that we we cannot ensure if students are<br>doing it at home in their flat we cannot<br>ensure that they're actually doing it we<br>never could and it's just um just a<br>crazy assumption that was ever made so<br>those tools like exam soft they're<br>trivial to get around and students have<br>been getting around them since they've<br>been used if that means does it but does<br>it mean we have computers in Labs that<br>students are sitting on and they're<br>somehow cut off from the Internet or<br>whatever<br>um yeah maybe I mean we do that in<br>computer science and if if the if the<br>particular skill requires using a<br>computer then sure<br>um I don't see why not<br>okay how are we going for time<br>got a couple more a couple more many<br>from the uh Bridge surgery we haven't<br>heard from you<br>killed a brilliant Cura panel um I'm<br>interested to hear the panel's thoughts<br>on there's some really interesting<br>intellectual property questions around<br>chat gbt and AI generally one very basic<br>one is are they allowed to copy the<br>internet in the first place which will<br>be the subject of law cases but more<br>specifically in the context of today's<br>discussion<br>I'm interested in what you think about<br>the concept of authorship and you know<br>we're going back to the idea of<br>um engineering your prompt<br>whether the our notion of authorship<br>um you know our whole knowledge system<br>in the in at least in the western<br>ideology is very individualistic and it<br>is you know it's me that did this and I<br>am producing this thing is that notion<br>going to change<br>with AI because it's a more Collective<br>way of producing things grants example<br>of someone writing a paper some<br>researchers already listed check GTP as<br>a co-author on a paper that they<br>submitted to Springer and Springer had<br>to come out and say no you can't do that<br>it's not it's not a co-author because it<br>can't hasn't got an email address that<br>we can put on the form essentially<br>anyway yeah that's that's my sort of<br>general question so you know our<br>students<br>will be possibly producing less<br>themselves so is that something we need<br>to Grapple with this notion of<br>authorship in philosophy we are telling<br>students at the moment that chat GPT is<br>not a citable source<br>the things in your reference list are<br>citable sources we expect you'll use<br>chat GPT and it might give you some good<br>ideas at some point you can't cut and<br>paste bits and and say chat GPT did this<br>but but that's pedagogical and and out<br>in the wider world what are people going<br>to use it for I think it's going to be<br>tremendous for lots of people for whom<br>English isn't their first language you<br>know smart people but they they just<br>have more work to do than I have to<br>write a report boom suddenly I can write<br>a report in in copy book English<br>um it is that thing of what are we<br>trying to what are we trying to get and<br>then in the research sense what are we<br>trying to credential or what's the<br>provenance that we are that we're after<br>you know if it's pbrf then it's<br>government wants to know how much work<br>James did and Richard did this sort of<br>thing so it's going to be hard to get<br>away from that sort of atomistic model<br>of knowledge but this is a very<br>interesting tool because it's<br>very unessimistic yeah<br>okay uh well well thank you to the<br>panelists um so I just had to wrap up<br>because we're out of time um if you want<br>to stay behind and have a brief chat um<br>we're happy to talk to you about various<br>things but to close out let me thank a<br>few people<br>um so thanks to the media production<br>team for the use of their facilities and<br>their cameras Etc uh for Russell and<br>Bronwyn for organizing it all thank you<br>um and to the panelists of course for<br>your very insightful comments I must say<br>and then finally to the audience
