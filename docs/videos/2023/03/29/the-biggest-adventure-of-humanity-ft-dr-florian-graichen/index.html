Continents, countries, companies, and communities are waking up to this inconvenient truth. Like other future threats we are very slow to realize them and react.<br><br>There are several messages I want to leave with you during and after this lecture.<br><br>Business as usual, solutions from the past and incremental change does not get us even near to solutions for the challenges that we are facing over the coming decades. Our current approaches and way of thinking got us into the situation we are in. Relying exclusively on our current approaches would fulfil Einstein’s definition of insanity – “…doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results”! Climate change is the challenge of our generation - it is a global disruptor - economically, environmentally and socially.<br><br>But I also want to leave you with a different message - Climate Change is also the opportunity of our generation - There are enormous opportunities and rewards for the continents, countries and companies that are (becoming) disruptors rather than disruptiees.<br><br>There are stories of success and hope – driven by creative people and built through innovation – let me tell you a few of them – so many opportunities for Aotearoa.<br><br>In this lecture I would like to reflect on topics like:<br>How do we address the urgency of responding to climate change and biodiversity loss without missing the big opportunities – like the global transition to circular and bioeconomies) that this challenge provides?<br><br>The world is moving towards 10 billion people – 10 billion people that require food, clothing, housing….everything we know we are using today – but we will need to derive it from sustainable – not fossil materials. How do we address the increased demand for sustainable feedstock for both – our existing and the new and emerging sectors – and the growing world population?<br><br>How do we take a more people centred approach to local economic development that works to produce broadly shared economic prosperity, equity and a just transition for all.<br><br>A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step – let’s be brave enough to take this step.<br><br> https://www.scionresearch.com/<br><br>

or<br>with the appropriate academic government<br>it's really true pressure pleasure to do<br>it<br>what I started with is it sales me it<br>speaks about a new day in the dorm the<br>birds are singing in the trees a better<br>future a better tomorrow<br>it acknowledges everyone<br>in the room<br>everyone that brings wisdom and<br>foresight to the to the Culpeper<br>and it also<br>I think it speaks to this adventure that<br>I want to I want to speak about<br>the purpose of Adventure better a better<br>future better tomorrow and I want to<br>let me start first by why why do I care<br>and why do I think it is such an<br>important part<br>so there are two parts to the wide work<br>here one is the the professional Park<br>it's the part of what I want to talk<br>about but then also I want to<br>acknowledge the University of Icon too<br>um let me start with the with the<br>University of waikato as you've heard I<br>had over the last six years probably<br>seven years I've worked very closely<br>with Professor configuring together in<br>our national science challenge spearhead<br>so is a very privileged member proud<br>member of the Amir meal project this is<br>extremely well aligned with our work and<br>for for sale and Partnerships across<br>from from industry to Academia even and<br>government are critical so this is<br>something we treasure and is really<br>important to us so that's one part<br>on the professional side that's my it is<br>my job and it's it's what I'm<br>um what's sad and possible to do is Step<br>part<br>transitioning linear disorder different<br>types of economy<br>but that's only one part the other part<br>is<br>personally I think it is the right thing<br>to do so here<br>professionally we went to a 20 30<br>strategy a 2050 timeline New Zealand has<br>a 2015 Net Zero goal and that looks very<br>matter of fact spoken but then on a<br>personal level I have two kids<br>six and ten so if I go to 2030 they will<br>be 17 and 30 by 2050 they will be 33 and<br>37. so everything we do now it matters<br>so all I'm on a much more personal I<br>think it is really critical so that's<br>why I truly care about that subject<br>foreign<br>so what I want to do tonight is<br>four big big parts for the talk<br>so Forum Adventure you normally need a<br>reason to start an adventure if if<br>you're comfortable where you are and if<br>you<br>content where you where you currently at<br>a moment not with no big reason to look<br>for an adventure so I want to describe<br>to you the burning platform that we are<br>facing<br>the next part is okay we've established<br>a burning platform and the question<br>always is so what what should we do<br>and then one thing I've seen over the<br>couple of years around this topic around<br>speaking about transitioning or the the<br>challenges we are facing<br>I've seen that at a couple of<br>conferences where when you paint such a<br>grim in such a such a daunting picture<br>we had students in the room that really<br>asked and it's like what's the point of<br>you know me studying so what I want to<br>do is instead of just leaving it with<br>with all these challenges I want to talk<br>to you about a couple of stories of<br>opportunity each of them individually<br>you know won't make a won't solve all<br>the challenges but they are the first<br>stepping stones and just to show you<br>examples what can be done<br>and then<br>the last thing is why does it matter or<br>why do you matter and why does your<br>so if you if you reflect on where we are<br>now and what we now today<br>is it seems to be quite obvious you<br>might have you all have experienced what<br>happened over summer<br>there were a lot of voices like well<br>climate change has truly arrived and I<br>think most of you know that that's not<br>truly arrived it's been with us for a<br>long time and then there is that of who<br>would have seen that coming who would<br>have thought that that truly is an issue<br>and I just want to point out<br>a news article<br>here from 1912<br>it's uh written in New Zealand<br>and<br>if you look at you can you can read<br>through it it speaks to burning coal<br>and what it does so it produces carbon<br>dioxide<br>and this trend makes the ear<br>like a blanket for the Earth<br>and it rises the temperature<br>and the only thing you might disagree<br>with is this here below the effect may<br>be considered considerable in a few<br>centuries so I think they got that one<br>wrong<br>but the rest<br>we knew this for over 100 years<br>so none of that should come as a<br>surprise what we what we have to talk<br>today so the question why did no one<br>tell us that's not true it was likely no<br>the other part is and that's interesting<br>to reflect<br>throughout with covet still going on<br>and over the last four years<br>so if you look at what we are facing at<br>the moment a number of challenges<br>if you go back to 2019 maybe 2020 we we<br>thought the big thing that we're all<br>facing is covet so that was this one<br>wave and then suddenly it's like oh<br>there's this this this thing called<br>recession<br>and suddenly people's like oh and<br>climate change is happening as well yeah<br>that's right<br>and people then started well even worse<br>than you know Rising temperatures there<br>is that other consequences like<br>biodiversity loss<br>and then something I thought being born<br>grown up in in Europe I would have never<br>have to talk about is is war<br>and if you put all these things together<br>that's these are all the consequences of<br>what can what can lead or what the<br>current challenges can lead to So<br>currently we are facing a number of<br>these of these waves and all bettering<br>so there are there are major challenges<br>that we are that we are facing and<br>if you I assume most of you have heard<br>about Earth overshoot Day so that's the<br>day in the calendar year where we have<br>statistically used up all the resources<br>that we can renew and replenish<br>and that day with the exception of<br>Culvert pretty much is moving forward<br>and forward so from that day then onward<br>each year we're consuming the resources<br>of our children and children's children<br>and next Generations so from that moment<br>on we treat the Earth like a credit card<br>and on that level if if the world would<br>live like we live in New Zealand we<br>would need five planets Earth basically<br>the other thing that we observe more and<br>more<br>the crossing of planetary boundaries<br>so there are nine planetary boundaries<br>speaking about you know the the soil<br>water<br>beyond beyond just temperature<br>and<br>starting off in 2009 we crossed three of<br>these 2015 it was four 2022 it is five<br>so what that what that shows us is<br>currently<br>the current way of doing things is is<br>not sustainable it can't it can't go on<br>like that it's a one-way Street and the<br>only thing we're debating is the length<br>of the one-way Street and when we're<br>hitting a massive a massive<br>Rock<br>and<br>um it's not about if we will hit that<br>the other thing I want to to do is again<br>all this knowledge is is summarized in<br>in many reports so the ipcc report that<br>pulls together a lot of this data across<br>the world what what is happening what is<br>happening on the climate side what is<br>happening with temperatures and I've<br>summarized here<br>the five what I think is probably quite<br>quite Grim take away messages from this<br>report across the world<br>so the first one<br>climate change is hurting our health I<br>think we've seen over summer you can<br>replace Health with with life it's it's<br>killing people<br>then I observed more and more over<br>summer the the debate around oh we need<br>to adapt basically and you yes adapting<br>is one part but you can only adapt to a<br>certain a certain level if the average<br>temperature is 50 degrees there is not<br>much left to to adapt if the water<br>levels rise there's not much left to<br>adapt or adapting will be extremely<br>expensive so adapting yes but also<br>we need to change fundamentally change<br>systems and and the way we are working<br>and living<br>the other part some things will be lost<br>forever and this is around biodiversity<br>biosecurity we notice that things will<br>definitely be lost and in that context<br>the the last point point one doesn't<br>sound much every tenth of a degree on<br>average temperature rise matters<br>so there's a lot of<br>urgency in these reports<br>that we that we really need to translate<br>into into actions as as soon as<br>practical<br>the other the other part on this I<br>wanted to to illustrate<br>what climate change actually means and<br>it's Way Beyond it's getting warmer or<br>it will rain more or<br>um will have more floods that's that's a<br>part of it that's correct but there is<br>so much more there is from<br>um refugees there is from Hunger there<br>is from food supply challenges it's a<br>much more diverse picture than just the<br>just the temperature<br>and the last point on this slide<br>unfortunately it will be hit the poorest<br>will be hit the hardest so that comes<br>where any any transition that we have to<br>do has to be<br>off the context no one can be left<br>behind<br>so what does that mean and I wanted this<br>this talk I wanted to focus more on a<br>science engineering<br>Material Science level it doesn't mean<br>that on the social side design side<br>biological environmental side it's not<br>important but I wanted to focus on on<br>one element of all this transition<br>and one thing is<br>we still need to make our day-to-day<br>objects we still need to live we need<br>clothes we need furniture we need<br>all the parts that that you know make<br>our life<br>and the question then is if you can't<br>use if you need to leave fossil<br>resources in the ground<br>how much do you need to leave in the<br>ground and if you look at these numbers<br>and you look at the current projections<br>of our extractive way of of living we<br>are not even near any of these on any of<br>these numbers and this is just for two<br>degrees average warming so there's a<br>significant amount of how we we live our<br>life that will have to change if we if<br>we meant to leave all these things in<br>the ground and again<br>in the setting of fear and and the work<br>that I'm involved in I believe science<br>engineering technology has a lot of the<br>so if you if you think about that if you<br>paint that picture in your in your head<br>where we are at today where the world is<br>moving<br>I think for me that is a burning truly a<br>burning platform that<br>just going ahead the way we've done<br>can't be the solution and we need to<br>during during Culvert I don't know if if<br>you if you can remember that in<br>in 2019 2020 when the world moved into<br>into lockdown and we all stayed at home<br>we didn't go to to work for we work from<br>home sorry I I let me rephrase that<br>now we stopped producing we we didn't<br>run the factories and there were<br>pictures where in India you could see<br>the Himalaya for the first time in in 50<br>years where in around the world you know<br>City or pictures of city where there was<br>you know no plane in the sky it was<br>clear<br>and there was for a while it's like oh<br>that that's a way out of the out of the<br>issue<br>but what that also demonstrated that<br>sustainability is a has multiple<br>Dimensions so it in that case we only<br>worked in one dimension we didn't look<br>at is this economically sustainable is<br>it socially sustainable yes while it<br>might be environmentally sustainable all<br>the multiple Dimensions have to have to<br>work<br>but what it would have shown us is or<br>could have shown us is instead of this<br>desire or<br>we would like to go back to back to<br>normal it could have been a possibility<br>to think about or is it not going back<br>is it actually going forward to a<br>different opportunity and I think we<br>still have that a number of number of<br>this these ways of different different<br>the other thing on the on these so what<br>is<br>you've heard the burning platform<br>but it's not going to get easier last<br>year I think it was October October or<br>November statistically we became an 8<br>billion people planet<br>now if you go forward over the next<br>until 2050 will be a 10 billion people<br>planet<br>and this won't be just an additional you<br>know 2 billion people this will be<br>rising middle class they will want to<br>have six fashion Cycles they want two<br>cars they want to fly on holiday they<br>want to have a house in the beach house<br>so the challenge that we are facing is<br>not going to get any easier<br>and again this is a part of this<br>adventure we're on it's not only<br>resolving<br>um material challenges where can I get a<br>better better plastic can I can I avoid<br>waste there's a much more fundamental<br>issue around a whole rethinking economy<br>rethinking what what a successful Nation<br>should look like at the moment we<br>measure success by by GDP but if you<br>look at these numbers that is definitely<br>and one of the one of the ways I think<br>in in there New Zealand has a huge<br>Advantage is that if you see the the<br>issues and you try to see and solve the<br>issues with the same knowledge that you<br>you had when you got to the issues that<br>is is will lead to failure<br>and I think this is an advantage why<br>while it is a huge challenge it's a huge<br>burning platform I think New Zealand has<br>a special gift for that<br>unlike many other countries we have<br>the special opportunity to look at a<br>second knowledge system TR Maori<br>knowledge system<br>that is built around sustainability<br>future Generations intergenerational<br>well-being<br>so we could use this gift and not just<br>rely on traditional ways of solving<br>issues and look at it from a completely<br>different angle not many nations have<br>that New Zealand has that gift and I<br>think we should use this to avoid<br>the other thing I want to point out is<br>quite often people debate yes that might<br>all be possible but that will take too<br>long and I just want to show you two<br>pictures that demonstrate how quickly<br>things can change and<br>if people try to change them how things<br>how quickly things will change there's<br>two pictures so the first one<br>is called spot the car or spot the<br>automotive so this is in in New York<br>1900<br>everything here with with horses and as<br>you would expect it and there is one<br>so then<br>oops then you go to<br>10 years or 13 years ahead same city<br>same same street and then it is a<br>picture is called spot the horse so you<br>see only one left behind there and<br>that's only only 13 years between that<br>and if you think what it what it would<br>take to turn a city around it to build<br>this type of cars it's remarkable but<br>it's possible and I think that should<br>that should demonstrate if you really<br>want to change you can you can do that<br>so the same question like how quickly<br>can I change a city from you know horses<br>and and to or horses to to cars is how<br>quickly can I change our economy because<br>right now<br>that's what we have to do at the moment<br>we are in this conventional<br>starting maybe to talk about Green<br>lucky if we are sustainable type of of<br>economy<br>but that's not enough that that will<br>just lock in the status quo so the type<br>of economy we have to look at and this<br>is that changing to a from from horses<br>to to cars uh analogy it's not a<br>degenerating is a regenerating it's<br>restorative it's regenerative type of<br>economy and that is Way Beyond<br>uh sustainable sustainable is a is a a<br>must do but not sufficient<br>it has to go Way Beyond just sustainable<br>it has to work with nature not work not<br>not take from nature it's working with<br>nature and building beyond what we are<br>the other the other challenge that we<br>see at the moment quite often when we<br>talk climate change and you probably if<br>you read the newspaper<br>it is this carbon or this carbon tunnel<br>vision it it is like you<br>when you hear it you think you resolve<br>the carbon challenge or the carbon<br>emission challenge you will solve<br>climate change but that's not true and<br>that's quite a dangerous position to be<br>in<br>it's important absolutely I totally<br>agree with that but it has to be much<br>more so you have to look at by far more<br>elements of that of that issue and I<br>think that is one of the biggest<br>challenges we face at the moment where<br>we have in our personal life you've seen<br>these these waves<br>there is you know your your cost of<br>living goes up but you still have to<br>think about it but that is unless we<br>start considering that these these big<br>topics these big rocks that we are<br>facing we will always just do Patchwork<br>so again coming to the to that<br>engineering mindset what does that mean<br>in terms of consequences<br>so the big two the big two things on<br>that carbon element are the current<br>energy system that we are that we're<br>looking at and it's our materials<br>on the on the energy side<br>what it means is decarbonization and<br>this is a big part that that I'm<br>involved in is looking at what are these<br>sustainable energy sources that we can<br>use and I think it is really important<br>that it's not a what what is pitched<br>around the media quite often it is<br>windig and hydrogen or is solar against<br>bioenergy that is the wrong attitude it<br>is against fossil energy and they all<br>have to work together<br>the other other thing you quite often<br>hear in the even in the material side<br>the term are we need to decarbonize<br>material and we need to decarbonize our<br>uh our products and I think that is not<br>helpful<br>um because if you think about your<br>clothes you can't decarbonize your<br>clothes that's made out of out of out of<br>carbon you are made out of carbon so I<br>think it is much more helpful to speak<br>about renewable because you still have<br>to say where do you take the carbon how<br>do you make your clothes how do you<br>build your houses so taking just<br>reducing to to decarbonizing is not<br>sufficient<br>and that is the the other message I want<br>to leave you with when you when you<br>think about<br>studying or or working in that area of<br>engineering Material Science is how big<br>the impact is<br>there is always that belief we resolve<br>the energy equation and then that will<br>take care of the of the challenges but<br>that's not true it's important it's<br>about 55 of the emissions will come from<br>are coming from the energy side<br>but then nearly the same amount coming<br>from how we grow our food how we<br>manufacture our products from how we<br>built our houses so if you if you think<br>about houses built with concrete is one<br>of the worst uh Footprints so what are<br>the better material Solutions<br>um plastic what are the better Solutions<br>so there is a lot to be done in that<br>materials engineering science space to<br>the other thing and this is important we<br>do not have to wait to run out of fossil<br>fuel<br>the transition from this from the Stone<br>Age into the into the next stage did not<br>happen because the world was running out<br>of stones there were more than enough<br>Stones yet we moved on the same with the<br>fossil age will be we are not gonna mind<br>the last barrel of oil the transition<br>will happen because we come up with<br>better Solutions<br>and the better we can equip<br>the next generation of researchers the<br>next generation of of kids with the<br>tools to do that the quicker we get off<br>the stones into a into a more advanced<br>age<br>so having having said having spoken<br>about that we need to keep<br>carbon in the ground<br>but we still need to dress 10 billion<br>people so where do we take all that<br>material from that that we have there<br>and that's it's two things to this slide<br>so one it requires a system change<br>simply thinking our current system with<br>six fashion cycles and you know everyone<br>having you know their own cars that<br>won't work with with renewable feedstock<br>either<br>so there is an element of rethinking<br>businesses rethinking ways of living<br>but also rethinking where we take the<br>material to make these Goods<br>and if you take<br>fossil car fossil be it cold be it crude<br>oil be it other sources of of<br>non-renewable material out you've got<br>essentially three forms<br>of carbon<br>of building blocks that you can use<br>so that's from the technosphere the<br>atmosphere and the biosphere so the<br>technosphere I really want to to show<br>you I want to you think about more than<br>just recycling so this is really your<br>reusing things you we have so many<br>things in in already in our in our<br>economy in our daily lives yes we<br>recycle some but how can we repair<br>rethink reuse redesign better so that's<br>you will always need some new materials<br>things break so that is where the other<br>two pots come from so the biosphere so<br>think about<br>um<br>bioplastics bioenergy there are some<br>some new carbon that we can use that we<br>can insert that system as long as the<br>feedstock is growing is grown<br>sustainably or sustainably<br>and the last one<br>it's kind of an emerging field of<br>research is we have CO2 in the<br>atmosphere and and smart science<br>technology and and approaches allow us<br>to turn then that out of the atmosphere<br>directly into products or into materials<br>so these are the three parts we can use<br>and again they are not to be played out<br>against each other it's the one better<br>than the other they all have their their<br>reason and their purpose and if you play<br>this against each other it becomes uh<br>the only winner will be um the fossil<br>bucket that we definitely have to keep<br>in the ground otherwise you've seen the<br>numbers<br>and what that would mean for our economy<br>and if you take if you take the use of<br>of oil or the the amount of oil we are<br>mining is a as a proxy for standing our<br>current linear way of living<br>and you you span the timeline from the<br>year 1000 to the year 3000 and you plot<br>upwards the amount of oil consumption<br>consumption and someone living in in 50<br>60 years in the future will look back<br>then that's what it will look like there<br>will be our current way of living is<br>this brief blip in history<br>in the past we lived with the land or<br>off the land in the future we will live<br>with the land of the land and there's<br>only this this<br>kind of little strange thing in the<br>Middle where people thought yes taking<br>non-renewable things out of the ground<br>okay<br>where and when this this will bottom off<br>it's not it's not to scale but that<br>ultimately is what we're looking at at<br>the moment with this transition with<br>the other thing I think that's important<br>that's where I want to get with some of<br>the stories of success and stories of<br>what has happened in the country<br>when President Kennedy spoke about<br>reaching the moon he spoke about the<br>challenge of a generation I think our<br>previous prime minister spoke about<br>climate change is the challenge of a<br>generation and that is sounds very<br>daunting I think the other thing we<br>should look at it is the opportunity of<br>a generation because it's the<br>opportunity to really rethink the<br>economy and do things differently and do<br>things better so yes it's the challenge<br>but I also would like but we see it as<br>and speaking of opportunity that's where<br>I want to talk you now through a couple<br>of examples<br>it's very<br>Centric to what I'm exposed to so it's<br>it's very personal stories or stories of<br>um activities we've done at Scion<br>and um<br>I'm happy to then go into more detail<br>that's the other part is with all these<br>stories in itself they might why didn't<br>you do this or why did you not do it<br>better or you could have done it faster<br>like all these things it's important to<br>start with the first step the whole<br>journey we are on is is is thousand<br>thousand miles it's more than just one<br>step but the important thing is to get<br>started<br>they all could be summarized under one<br>thing that we see<br>it at sound is one of the Mission Vision<br>and purpose is that ultimately anything<br>you have made or we making from fossil<br>fuel at the moment could be made from a<br>tree tomorrow<br>so if you pick a big big statement but<br>ultimately I think if you expand it to<br>the other three forms of of renewable<br>so the first example I want to tell you<br>is the story<br>from a company called usefully<br>so the problem I would like to address<br>this in New Zealand we have 220<br>000 tons of textiles going to landfill<br>every year<br>so 220 000 tons of textile<br>what we what we worked on with with<br>usefully is not the whole sustainable<br>textile part it's it's resolving one one<br>element we're talking here not about the<br>school uniforms you can pass on to the<br>next generation or you know swapping<br>clothes that still has to happen this is<br>really<br>um things textiles that end up you can't<br>you can't use it in any other way<br>anymore<br>at the same time What New Zealand does<br>we import<br>about 200 000 tons of additives for<br>routing that we need to make our you<br>know stick the the bitumen and the stick<br>the asphalt together<br>so what we developed with that company<br>is a way of using these textiles process<br>these textiles so instead of importing<br>200 000 tons of of additives we could<br>use that for our roads instead so you<br>cut out you cut out exports and you you<br>put these textiles or the material out<br>artists and designers<br>I'm a scientist I'm a chemist by by<br>training but I think one of the biggest<br>roles in that whole transition<br>have<br>the journalists the artists and the<br>designers to play<br>and this is one example where we're<br>working with David trooprich he's<br>probably best known for his lamps<br>and working with him allows us to bring<br>materials to life<br>and<br>we worked we were privileged to work<br>with him for the New Zealand exhibition<br>in Dubai where we combined Powershell<br>harakiki fiber kind of materials of New<br>Zealand relevance and he turned it into<br>into beautiful lamps that were used in<br>the New Zealand Pavilion<br>and a lot of part of this change<br>management is you need to show to people<br>what is possible<br>and as a scientist you used to producing<br>you know simple<br>test samples but if we get when we get<br>to work with David and he makes<br>beautiful lamps it's much easier to<br>excite people about material in material<br>properties that it is just with pest<br>samples<br>biofuels big part of our our work and<br>this is where New Zealand has a huge<br>need I assume most of you you have<br>family probably overseas friends<br>overseas so yes we will want to travel<br>and part of living in New Zealand is you<br>will get on a plane eventually<br>so the big the big thing is how do we<br>decarbonize that<br>internally for internal flights we're<br>looking at probably about 2030 will be<br>electrified the moment you fly across<br>the ditch you need liquid liquid fuel so<br>instead of importing fuel we could use<br>our trees sustainably ground trees<br>convert that into into biofuel<br>similar to shipping 99 of our economy is<br>dependent on on export import<br>and if you look at the boats currently<br>underway they will they will be on the<br>on on the on the oceans for the next<br>decades to come all the ships we're<br>building at the moment need liquid fuel<br>so there's another opportunity for our<br>amazing produce amazing fruit vegetable<br>to reach the global markets in a<br>sustainable Way by producing and<br>Manufacturing sustainable marine fuel in<br>New Zealand so these are two big topics<br>hey Google guys<br>that's a it's a beautiful example of<br>what science can mean for a small<br>community in in New Zealand but also how<br>what we refer to as waste is actually an<br>important resource so what Eco guests<br>did in reporos between Rotorua and toppo<br>they built the first commercial<br>anaerobic digester so an anaerobic<br>digester takes biomaterials<br>some some microbes and turns that into<br>biogas or bioenergy<br>what Eco gas does they're using the<br>organic waste food waste for about 75<br>000 tons and using that in their<br>facility<br>next to them they have the greenhouse<br>greenhouses from turnerton Growers so<br>they use that to heat the greenhouse<br>greenhouses with renewable energy<br>produces food and is a byproduct you get<br>biofertilizer<br>so that created about 50 60 jobs in the<br>region<br>and allowed as I said to divert at least<br>75 000 tons of of food waste from<br>landfill again it's a bigger picture<br>food waste but again there is so much<br>organic waste in our landfill that we<br>can actually do these things and we're<br>exploring with them other parts of the<br>country where these similar facilities<br>accuracy it's it's a small company in<br>paroa<br>a family-owned business working with<br>seaweed and they've been using seaweed<br>in biofertilizers cosmetics and the like<br>our team started working with them and<br>looking at what else can you make out of<br>seaweed and they came up with a with an<br>interesting<br>material called manicellulose<br>so that is you're processing your<br>seaweed accuracy can go and do their<br>Cosmetics fertilizers whatever they do<br>with it and with what is left over you<br>can process it to what's called<br>nanocellulose well what can you use<br>nanocellulose for you can use quite<br>amazing things with it you can use them<br>in planting of of trees you can use them<br>in medical care wound care you can use<br>them in printed Electronics you can use<br>them in all sorts of other application<br>but again what that showed is like<br>taking a waste stream in a rural<br>Regional setting<br>a company that allows them to produce<br>new things and accuracy has employed a<br>dozen more people to take that beyond<br>their current business it's an extremely<br>exciting opportunity because it's also<br>so closely linked to the to the local<br>community local Eevee and hapu that are<br>collecting the seaweed and getting the<br>plastic waste we've got<br>millions of pieces of plastic in the<br>Horticulture agriculture sector easy to<br>say you should reuse but if you look at<br>that that is full of dirt that is very<br>hard to find is distributed all over the<br>place<br>what we did there we worked with<br>entrepreneurial company to look at these<br>Nursery pots hundreds of thousands of<br>them are used in nurseries across New<br>Zealand every every year and we've got<br>it now to a to a stage where the company<br>is producing biodegradable pots so they<br>can be planted together with the trees<br>or with the with the seedlings remain in<br>the in the ground do not degrade to bio<br>to microplastics and go back to to CO2<br>and and water so it's a great<br>entrepreneurial opportunity again for<br>New Zealand companies in that field<br>not just to to make it plastic free but<br>distributed manufacturing so this is<br>something around that that of completely<br>rethinking how manufacturing works<br>in a world of fossil energy of or crude<br>oil what you have is these massive<br>refineries because your whole feedstock<br>is highly highly centralized in in crude<br>oil so the world built whole cities<br>based on refining<br>going forward now what we're looking at<br>is actually completely different feeds<br>that we don't have this big Central<br>pieces of you know crude oil anymore if<br>we're looking at how can we make best<br>use of our Horticulture agricultural<br>viticulture type of waste we have to<br>rethink How We Do manufacturing How We<br>Do processing<br>and one way of that is like in the past<br>you had these massive ship of crude oil<br>ships you know bringing bringing the<br>feedstock to the factory processing it<br>here<br>now we turn that around we say instead<br>of bringing you know<br>scattered seasonal Regional little bit<br>of feedstock to Big centralized<br>facilities we'll turn it around and<br>bring the facility to the feedstock so<br>you can imagine<br>40-foot containers into the Marlboro<br>wine growing region maybe during<br>wine Harvest you have for six to eight<br>weeks you've got wine promise you can<br>put a factory there that processes<br>uh Vine promise to materials densifies<br>it so it can be can be shipped on it<br>could be Forest slash it could be<br>agricultural harvesting stubble so you<br>can change the the type of processing<br>that you do there without having to ship<br>around all these uh seasonal and<br>we've got I think one of our staff<br>member Angelique is here so that's her<br>that's her baby and this is looking at<br>3D printing material not only 3D<br>printing but it's has the ability also<br>to respond to to heat<br>and she made designed their material<br>that is biodegradable but also can<br>respond to to temperature so for<br>a big part of what we do is also how do<br>you inspire the Next Generation you have<br>to give them some some more interesting<br>material than just plastic so what<br>Angelique did she developed here a type<br>of material that can be 3D printed<br>changes by by heat and and temperature<br>and we found with a small New Zealand<br>company imagine Plastics that are<br>selling that and you can order that type<br>of material online now<br>so while in itself not not a big kind of<br>solving Global issues but what it allows<br>it inspires again that next generation<br>of students to look at there are<br>different materials available and they<br>want to play with it and want to explore<br>so we've all we've all with all these<br>stories and we hear that a lot it's like<br>well that's fine if you can you know<br>replace a you know a little bit of<br>plastics with that and if you can make<br>you know take a couple of thousand tons<br>out of landfill<br>um everyone is ah that doesn't make a<br>big difference but as you know if you<br>try to sleep with a mosquito it can't be<br>that small that you don't it does it<br>makes a huge difference and I think<br>that's the important thing it won't be<br>that that one massive thing that will<br>make a difference is this continuous<br>small things small steps First Step that<br>will make that big change in the big<br>difference<br>you can't you can't sit back and wait<br>for someone else to to do that I think<br>especially in a university setting<br>it you have to you have to be the change<br>that you want to see there's uh so many<br>reasons why others are not doing it or<br>it it can't happen or it won't happen<br>if you want to see the change<br>every one of you can be a part of that<br>whole<br>doing things differently looking at<br>things differently thinking about what<br>you buy you have as a consumer you've<br>got enormous power in doing your bit<br>the other part and this speaks to the<br>opportunity and I think this is where<br>New Zealand needs to go the world is<br>changing everything I've told you at the<br>moment is this is happening across the<br>whole world<br>us as a country being a part of that<br>whole global global system and we will<br>remain a part of that global system is<br>if we are not disrupting we will be<br>disrupted<br>doesn't matter in which<br>parts of that whole value Network we are<br>in sustainability renewability<br>regenerative type of businesses that is<br>that is where the future is unless we do<br>that it will be brought upon us<br>and<br>I like that quote from<br>paulus is<br>uh we we don't know where we where we're<br>going and I think the only certainty<br>that we have is uncertainty and the best<br>way to respond to the uncertainty is<br>through disrupting not waiting for<br>disruption<br>so I spoke about<br>2030 so my kids will be you know 13 and<br>17 then<br>um 37 33<br>and I picked here basically the dawn<br>of the 22nd century and 2050 sounds so<br>far away 20 2100 sounds even further<br>away<br>and so why would you even care about<br>anything I've said in this whole<br>presentation<br>and you think about your children your<br>grandchildren your nieces your nephews<br>doesn't matter friends<br>and not my quote it's quote of a New<br>Yorker journalist anyone sitting in this<br>room<br>either love someone or will love someone<br>who is alive at the dawn of the 22nd<br>century<br>so if you don't do it for yourself<br>you need to do it for someone else and I<br>think that's a big part of this<br>thanks very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
