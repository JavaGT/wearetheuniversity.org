Dean of science here at<br>the University of Auckland it's my very<br>great pleasure to welcome you to the<br>university and to the inaugural lecture<br>of Professor Rochelle Constantine<br>Michelle has well known to many of us<br>through her many appearances on TV<br>advocating for citations or explaining<br>the latest whale research findings in<br>fact she takes her community engagement<br>role so seriously and does it so well to<br>Delight Delight to see Rochelle in<br>person this evening rather than just on<br>TV<br>that Rochelle is well known as because<br>she's good at what she does<br>although she says she accidentally got<br>into cessation research was to my mind a<br>very fortunate accent please do come on<br>privacy<br>for example she's helped us understand<br>previously unknown migration paths for<br>Wales from the Antarctic to the tropics<br>and back<br>how well populations are recovering or<br>declining what whales and dolphins are<br>doing in our own backyard the hauraki<br>golf and how tourism is impacting on<br>citations<br>all important and impactful work<br>well we might see Rochelle on TV a lot<br>her work is also regularly featured in<br>the top journals for her field<br>her nature appears in nature her current<br>work on biology appears in current<br>biology her Marine Mammal science<br>appears in Marine Mammal science<br>you get the picture<br>this is a result in a rich Corpus of<br>academic Publications but an equally<br>important set of technical reports and<br>advisory roles that have had impact on<br>conservation policy here and abroad<br>for example Rochelle has been a key<br>advisor on docs Hector and Maui dolphin<br>threat management plan as Chief science<br>advisor to live ocean<br>and an expert advisor for the<br>environmental defense Society<br>her work on whale strike causing a major<br>decline in The Bride As Wales whale<br>population in the hierarchy Gulf due to<br>higher ship speed was so compelling that<br>she convinced the major shipping lines<br>to voluntarily reduce their ship's speed<br>as they transited the gulf eliminating<br>wild strike whale strike mortality<br>if only work at kotah he had thought to<br>consult Rochelle before launching their<br>highway speed reduction campaign things<br>might have been different<br>Rochelle has received many accolades for<br>her work notable amongst these are the<br>prestigious Blake environmental<br>leadership award the New Zealand Marine<br>Science Society Medal for advances in<br>marine conservation and sustainability<br>and the Hurricane Golf Forum Jim<br>holdaway award for leadership<br>Michelle grew up in papamoa did her<br>Bachelor's in Zoology at Massey her<br>Masters and PhD in biology here at<br>Auckland postdocs and Islands suddenly<br>in California as well as stints as a<br>Marine Mammal Observer for the Japan UK<br>and U.S governments before joining the<br>academic staff and biological biological<br>sciences here at Auckland which we're<br>very grateful for<br>tonight Rochelle is going to tell us<br>about our big blue backyard and the<br>cetaceans that live in it Rochelle the<br>I'm so nervous<br>so I've written this talk several times<br>I hope you enjoy it<br>um so Kyoto Koto ifano my<br>um this beautiful footage which I might<br>put us on extra quality projection<br>hopefully that will work<br>um this beautiful footage is from Bruce<br>Foster an artist that I've been very<br>privileged to work with on a few<br>occasions<br>this highlights the vastness of the<br>ocean this has been my home for many<br>years at Sea and for most of my research<br>career<br>I like finding solutions to problems and<br>I like working with unlikely teams of<br>people to solve problems because the<br>richest conversations happens in those<br>spaces for me where different ideas come<br>together and the collective of those<br>ideas are stronger than when they're<br>apart I don't like sitting at the edges<br>of debates throwing rocks I like being<br>in the middle and working out how we can<br>get more people into the middle I'm<br>comfortable with uncertainty and I like<br>constructive disagreement and I love<br>teaching which is why I came here to the<br>University of Auckland<br>so these are a few sepia photos from my<br>youth which carbon dates me I think<br>I've always loved animals and I was<br>destined to be a vet that's my black cat<br>Fred slinking away those of you who know<br>me well know that dogs are my favorite<br>people and people are not my favorite<br>people dogs are definitely my favorite<br>and that's Bootsy my grandfather's dog<br>uh here I am rocking some safe safety<br>swimwear styles from the 1970s early sea<br>safety gear<br>um the place I call home is papamoa in<br>the Bay of Plenty where I grew up there<br>was the beach the road a house and then<br>the frogs and swamp and farmland behind<br>us it's not like that now my life went<br>on and always near the sea really began<br>in papamoa I have two Vivid memories<br>from my time at Massey University I<br>studied zoology and psychology one of<br>them is the Iron Maidens we had a<br>60-minute show made about us and caused<br>a right Ruckus because we won the<br>drinking games and did a floor suck and<br>it was not becoming of the ladies of the<br>time to do that there I am there I'm the<br>Winger I was fast because I was little<br>and when you play rugby and you're<br>little and um in the Manawa too you've<br>got to be fast the other memory for me<br>was Professor Claire veltman she came in<br>full force a whirl of hair and<br>enthusiasm she taught animal behavior in<br>year one and that was it I didn't want<br>to work with sick animals I didn't want<br>to be a vet anymore I wanted to be a<br>behavioral ecologist and I wanted to<br>work in animals in the wild<br>he is the hero of this lecture the ocean<br>70 of the planet responsible for at<br>least every second Breath You Take You<br>cannot live without it I've been<br>fortunate to sail through most of these<br>ocean spaces from the Arctic to the<br>Antarctic and most spaces in between and<br>these yellow blobs roughly show the<br>places I haven't been<br>I've sailed around and around and around<br>the world and I consider that an extreme<br>blessing at the time I never figured I<br>would be doing the job I'm doing<br>um yet here we are Life's a funny thing<br>there are men's challenges especially<br>for conservation biologists working in<br>this massive ocean space and time is of<br>the essence the ocean doesn't have time<br>and we don't care enough about it<br>as humans we're kind of constrained in<br>our thinking about the space of the<br>ocean and what we can do but we're not<br>actually constrained by our imaginations<br>and our ability to create innovative<br>solutions to solve problems and that's<br>where I really like I like hanging out<br>with really smart people<br>who who like thinking creatively<br>my early years I learned a lot in my<br>Masters of Science and PhD which was<br>based at TP fightangi in the Bay of<br>islands I was Guided by this amazingly<br>wonderful team of Supervisors and<br>advisors Diane Brunton who is now at<br>Massey Professor Diane Brunton who I<br>remain a firm friends with I was her<br>first PhD student and you never really<br>forget that because I remember my first<br>PhD student<br>Scott Baker of course who's here tonight<br>which um<br>I'm getting wobbly without Scott none of<br>my research career would have happened<br>so thank you Scott you've been wise<br>counsel and a great mentor for all this<br>time and you still are and a dear friend<br>um Baron wasig in the bottom corner who<br>I'll talk a little bit about more and<br>then Nick Gales who was a vet in<br>conservation biologist all of these<br>people are Risk Takers like pushing the<br>boundaries of Science and we're really<br>great great to have have stretchy ideas<br>with I was studying the impact of<br>Tourism on bottlenose dolphins and<br>common dolphins and bernd invited me to<br>kaikoura to see their site and that was<br>when I realized that one size does not<br>fit all it's a really good lesson in<br>conservation it's a really good lesson<br>in science one size does not fit all<br>this is where I saw the beautiful Dusky<br>Dolphins the most beautiful I think of<br>all the dolphins I do agree with band<br>and tourism and so uh here's here's band<br>here and Mel and their wonderful student<br>Yin who I've been friends with forever<br>very very dear friends and then a<br>younger me back in 1994.<br>both bernd and Mel are innovators in the<br>in the field of Marine Mammal science<br>and really pushed the boundaries<br>Pioneers in in our field<br>here I learned that I could repurpose<br>other tools of other people's trades to<br>study animals we stood on a hill we had<br>the big eyes binoculars which I've used<br>on ships you can see forever in those<br>things and then the theodolite now<br>theodolites are surveying instruments<br>that you usually see on the sides of<br>Roads we use them to track the boats and<br>the Dolphins and to understand the<br>impacts of Tourism and it was completely<br>different in kaikoura to what I was<br>seeing in the Bay of islands early<br>lessons to just not assume that what you<br>know from one place holds other places<br>after years at Sea my view was always<br>going to be very large scale this is our<br>big blue backyard Timon and Nui akiwa my<br>Moana I love this place I've sailed<br>through the North and the South and the<br>middle bits and the side bits and all<br>around it it's a beautiful beautiful<br>ocean the Atlantic not so much Pacific<br>beautiful love it this is the place of<br>Wales and the place of people integrally<br>entwined before whaling tens of<br>thousands of whales moved<br>um in the the winter months into these<br>tropical breeding grounds before they<br>then migrated through these ocean waters<br>down to Antarctic feeding grounds in<br>summer<br>the Pacific peoples also moved widely<br>throughout this region with ease and<br>they were at one with the birds the<br>whales the large sharks fishes all the<br>other things that moved and that was<br>lost when we destroyed Wales<br>it's a big ocean they're big whales and<br>we're a small lot of researchers in 1994<br>I was very lucky which was the first<br>year of my masters I was very lucky that<br>um Scott asked me to be part of this<br>Collective of people the South Pacific<br>well research Consortium they were<br>focused on that's not all the Consortium<br>in the boat by the way<br>there's about 70 of us now but I think<br>all of them in there are members of the<br>Consortium we're focused on<br>understanding the recovery of the whales<br>and threats to all citations in the<br>South Pacific my first trip to Tonga to<br>it was in 1994 it was a real eye-opener<br>and little did I know that I'd be in for<br>the Long Haul the dot dot dot is I'm<br>still there I just helped out for a<br>season yet here we are Serendipity is<br>great why were we interested in the<br>humpbacks well we nearly lost them<br>entirely in fact the way the humpback<br>whales of Fiji were lost the females who<br>knew where to go held the cultural<br>memory were wiped out by commercial<br>Whalers<br>when commercial whaling stopped in the<br>as you can see why did it stop there<br>were no more whales go figure<br>um<br>it was catastrophic it was a<br>catastrophic failure in fisheries<br>management and despite east Australia<br>which is the Blue Line in Oceania and<br>the red line having similar levels of<br>hunting the East Australian whales<br>recovered very quickly and whilst this<br>um you know stops just after sort of you<br>know 2010-ish uh today the the East<br>Australian and West Australian humpbacks<br>are fully recovered and going<br>gangbusters<br>we realized that our Collective workers<br>the Consortium using photo ID and<br>genetics and song showed that the<br>Oceania whales were recovering around<br>half the rate of almost all other<br>populations and they were listed as<br>endangered only one of two humpback<br>populations in the world that got that<br>listing<br>and we were really curious about why<br>well in the early days we spent a lot of<br>time matching flukes now kongakiku at<br>the top which means half tail that's a<br>nice easy one but the others also quite<br>easy but there are um we have I think<br>around 3 000 fluke images and we would<br>sit in a room matching them manually<br>going through piece by piece and you'll<br>notice the observant of you that there<br>was always more than one sneaky bottle<br>of wine on the table because it really<br>helped it was time consuming and it was<br>really hard work now there's this<br>program called happy whale and AI<br>enabled matching program that anyone can<br>put their humpback whale fluke in<br>anywhere in the world and it'll match it<br>like that and Tams and one of my<br>students was working on that for her<br>um her third year project in Marine<br>Science and managed to achieve great<br>things where it would have taken us<br>months and months and months to do so<br>these are advances that I love to see<br>we're also open to the exciting New<br>World of identifying individual animals<br>and their connection to place using<br>molecular tools as I said when Scott<br>started here molecular ecology was the<br>next big thing it was really exciting<br>Scott's work work in Tonga revealed<br>there were between 6 and 15 females left<br>in Tonga when commercial hunting of<br>Wales stopped we almost lost them in<br>Tonga and now Tonga is a really thriving<br>sort of central place within the Pacific<br>we create here at waipapa tomotaro an<br>archive of around 4 000 small tiny<br>little skin samples you can see them in<br>the tweezers that hold the secrets of<br>the Oceania whales since 1991. it was<br>clear the whales had plenty of breeding<br>crowned habitat we knew that from the<br>photos and the genetics and the song so<br>we were you know we were really sort of<br>concerned why they weren't recovering as<br>rapidly you know hunting had stopped and<br>and so we wanted to understand what else<br>might have been going on for this<br>population recovery it was time to look<br>elsewhere<br>I'm at my happiest and really cold<br>places I am very unhappy in the warm<br>there's only so many clothes that should<br>be taken off in my world and I'm happy<br>throwing them on so here I am wearing 23<br>items of clothing to have a day on the<br>water 11 hours on on the ocean with the<br>whales in Antarctica<br>this is what my Antarctic voyaging<br>usually looks like so people who go to<br>Antarctica have like beautiful eyes and<br>they're looking sexy and they've got<br>colored tents and they're making little<br>snow huts and you know they've got<br>Penguins just lying around it's all very<br>lovely mine looks like this I could be<br>off the Chatham rise I could be anywhere<br>and it's gray it's foggy there's almost<br>always a two meter swell and often<br>raging winds from more than one<br>direction it's a challenging place to<br>work so Nick my MSC and PhD advisor was<br>one of a group of Tenacious scientists<br>holding whaling Nations to account Scott<br>was also part of that that gang of<br>really really persistent people<br>mostly they focus on those Nations that<br>peddled misinformation this wasn't about<br>cultural take this was about lying as<br>part of this the Southern Ocean research<br>partnership was formed as part of the<br>international whaling commission and we<br>the whole idea was to show that you<br>could adapt non-lethal whale research<br>you didn't need to kill whales to know<br>things about them to understand them<br>it resonated really strongly with me<br>because I'm always about joining<br>research together I'm inclusive I love<br>being part of something bigger I'm a<br>joiner I'm not a splitter<br>I loved being part of this team and I<br>love being part of this team to this day<br>pushing the development of new<br>approaches and it was a game changer<br>our 2010 Antarctic whale expedition was<br>a huge success and it contributed to the<br>2014 International court of justice<br>ruling declaring that the Japanese<br>whaling program was not science<br>they ignored it yay Japan<br>but they did eventually stop they may<br>start again but I think that really put<br>sort of a PO in the ground like no this<br>is not science you do not have to kill<br>whales to understand them we have all<br>these other techniques and approaches I<br>think it's one of the proudest things<br>that I've been involved with<br>so unfortunately for me on the Antarctic<br>whale Expedition we traveled between 150<br>East and West so sort of either side of<br>that Ross sea in there I wanted to know<br>whether the Antarctic held clues about<br>why the Oceania humpbacks were<br>recovering so slowly instead we just<br>found east Australian Wales pretty much<br>and that one going through Cook Strait<br>was probably on its way to east<br>Australia so I was like a little<br>disappointing but I had a great time<br>anyway it was likely that the whales of<br>Oceania were further east we didn't know<br>but we didn't have nine million dollars<br>to have a voyage taking us to that place<br>so we had to think<br>instead we went to northernmost aotearoa<br>to the kermadec islands in particular we<br>this is a humpback from rangitahua<br>singing<br>male sing to attract females and they<br>also use it as a spacing thing between<br>males<br>it was in this place that we heard<br>hybrid song<br>this is the place where the whales are<br>learning from each other I'll just stop<br>this<br>I think<br>they have such silly songs they are<br>so we heard hybrid song this is a place<br>where whales are learning from each<br>other as they travel South to feed<br>I told Sheridan waitai from natikuri<br>where whanau on our shared connection to<br>the whales<br>she already knew as she wrote in a<br>recent publication<br>is<br>the songstress<br>the Weaver and their sister hinemwana<br>reside in the moon times of kwanga which<br>is Springtime these are our hindi's our<br>females who give the Rhythm and weaving<br>of sounds to support the ocean mothers<br>and their young as they travel so all<br>beneath the ocean crisps May Savor aroha<br>the language of love and the song Story<br>aligns with what we found using my<br>science the kind of science that that we<br>do in the Consortium the stories of the<br>singing whales are held very close by<br>natikuri and now the whales are<br>recovering so is their actual connection<br>back to that place last year I traveled<br>to rangitahua which is why my lecture<br>has been delayed as part of<br>MB Endeavor which is led by natikuri the<br>first very large Indian ever led by<br>indigenous people and it's also co-led<br>by the Auckland Museum and I worked with<br>Janie here with the camera and Herbie on<br>the Wales and we shared our different<br>knowledge as and now they can take the<br>work forward I don't need to go there<br>with increasing numbers of whales<br>passing rangitahua on their way to<br>Antarctica<br>I knew seeing as we couldn't get to<br>Antarctica we couldn't afford it it was<br>a place that we could perhaps do<br>Antarctic research go North to study<br>South<br>but this I could afford thankfully for<br>some funding uh some generous funding<br>from Pew and from Ministry for primary<br>industry Industries brag funding we were<br>able to get there<br>we deployed satellite tags this is what<br>that looks like it's officially known as<br>a drive-by shooting we took photos and<br>we collected skin and we got some really<br>cool data so when you drive up to a<br>humpback they have quite big personal<br>space so you have to be fast you have to<br>get in there do your business and go<br>away and leave them be so you can see<br>the tag there on the side you can see<br>the whale and gray there's a biopsy<br>arrow and at the very tip of it you'll<br>see a little stainless steel cutting tip<br>and you can see the tag deliverer which<br>the Tag's sitting in that shoots out and<br>then bounces off and we pick it up<br>with this information we were able to<br>tell a lot about the whales of<br>rangitahua<br>we were surprised that they came from a<br>3500 expense kilometer expense of<br>Oceania breeding grounds they didn't<br>just swim straight down from their<br>Island straight down to Antarctica they<br>came together they gathered the Hines<br>singing their song sharing their love<br>the whales stay for around four to five<br>days on average before completing their<br>migration South it's a long way to go<br>and they mostly Don't Go Near land<br>technological developments some of which<br>I've been involved in as part of our our<br>um Southern Ocean research partnership<br>work meant we could do more with less<br>and we still can to this day we need<br>only small tissue samples to reveal more<br>than just the sex ID and breeding ground<br>allocation<br>we were able to use epigenetic aging DNA<br>methylation to age the whales passing<br>rangitahua there was a median age of 14.<br>that's really encouraging because that<br>means they're coming back they're young<br>they're slowly getting over that hump<br>whatever's been holding them back and<br>they will take off the population should<br>increase faster now<br>there's one whale that was estimated<br>almost 70 years of age that way I was<br>alive when whaling occurred that whale<br>probably saw the wholesale Devastation<br>of many of its individuals that it hung<br>with<br>we also are able to use the blubber<br>progesterone to understand who's<br>pregnant this was a revelation as well<br>or over around over 50 percent of the<br>females were pregnant where we had<br>blubber sample<br>but more interestingly of those females<br>accompanied by a young of your calf so<br>she had given birth only a few months<br>earlier<br>45 were pregnant and so we're really<br>curious about what that is is that just<br>simply that they sort of carry one in<br>case they lived there lose their calf<br>there's High mortality rates of calves<br>and if they're still in good body<br>condition they'll be able to bring their<br>next calf through to full term and then<br>do they just spontaneously abort or<br>resorb the fetus if their calf makes it<br>down to Antarctic Waters we don't know<br>these are our interesting pieces of work<br>being done by led by Logan Paulin at UC<br>Santa Cruz and it's it's great working<br>with him<br>but those tagged tagged whales the<br>tracks were a great surprise<br>most went to the Ammons and bellings<br>housing sea as we predicted<br>the mothers with calves went due south<br>to the Rossi region the outer Rossi<br>region nowhere near the sea ice they're<br>often called you know Ice Age whales<br>these are not Ice Age whales they go<br>where they need to go the movement of<br>the mothers with their newborns they<br>travel slow anyone walked with a toddler<br>knows that you can't go fast<br>but this pattern of going to this region<br>was reported during the whaling era so<br>it's held in the female's knowledge of<br>what to do when you have a baby where to<br>go where to find food that you can<br>this region here this is where the mums<br>and calves went<br>so now we're on to measuring change the<br>whales are recovering there's no obvious<br>reason why Oceania whales are so slow in<br>their recovery and I think I'll work in<br>the tahua has really shown that they<br>will make it there is hope for them but<br>there are other changes now going on<br>in the assort project Southern Ocean<br>research partnership project on the<br>circumpolar distribution of Wales which<br>I have the pleasure of sharing I've<br>stepped down from it four years ago and<br>I'm still chairing it so I'm doing very<br>well at getting rid of some of my<br>responsibilities<br>the numbers of whales are still low<br>compared to the whaling era they're<br>getting there but it takes a long time<br>remember they haven't been hunted<br>commercially since around the mid 60s<br>apart from a few instances by the Soviet<br>Whalers they should be doing better but<br>they aren't and I think these are all<br>salutatory lesson for long-lived slow<br>breeding animals and that they don't<br>just bounce back it takes a very long<br>time<br>the tagging work which was part of a<br>recent nature publication identifying<br>areas of importance for large megafauna<br>were led by Mark hendel in a crowd of<br>really amazing people<br>um and and we're really pleased to see<br>our work which are the tracks in purple<br>included in in that<br>but this work um that we've been doing<br>as part of our assessment led by Ryan<br>Reisinger an amazing um postdoc at the<br>time he Now is working at University of<br>Southampton this brings together tag<br>data from 11 research programs allowing<br>us to identify drivers of foraging<br>habitat and modeling climate change<br>scenarios<br>um you know for these different<br>populations you'll see some go quite<br>close to Antarctica and some are a very<br>long way away there's 15 15 degrees of<br>latitude difference 55 degrees to 70<br>degrees which is a massive difference<br>but we'll continue to work on this<br>because it is very interesting it's<br>interesting also in light of that the<br>whales are shifting their habitat use<br>and distribution on their breeding<br>grounds this is some work that was led<br>by um Solen DeVille who was a postdoc at<br>the time using all of our years of data<br>so the dark line at the top and the<br>bottom is um is from<br>1999 to 2007 and then the dotted lines<br>are where we predict that the whales<br>will move<br>humpback whales have a thermal maximum<br>as they need to store energy for their<br>their migration South if it's too warm<br>they have to lose weight and then they<br>may not be in a good body condition to<br>gestate or feed their calf or get down<br>south so they actually don't like high<br>temperatures they move some countries<br>will no longer have humpback whales the<br>Samos will probably no longer see<br>humpbacks losing a very important<br>cultural part of the Samoan people's<br>lives that they almost entirely lost<br>because of commercial whaling It's a<br>cruel irony that they may now lose it<br>due to climate change we really need to<br>reflect all of us on the implications of<br>what we do and what they matter to these<br>places where whales and other animals<br>are held dear<br>we think this may already be happening<br>over this past three years we've had<br>very very warm Waters in the region and<br>there are some areas where Wales were<br>seen a lot where there are very low<br>sightings maybe rangitahua in time will<br>become a breeding ground we're yet to<br>see<br>climate change that is worries me a lot<br>here are the climate stripes for my<br>family<br>this is my grandparents time my parents<br>time my brother and I<br>it's not good<br>I think it will get a fail<br>if we were grading it things are<br>changing rapidly and the oceans are<br>feeling it the ocean has done a lot of<br>heavy lifting with climate change and it<br>another big project that I've worked on<br>is on whales and ships<br>conservation action requires very quick<br>thinking a motivated group of people and<br>being Comfort comfortable with less than<br>perfect knowledge<br>this is what a whale looks like when a<br>ship runs into it at high speed at every<br>bone in this Whale's Rib Cage and region<br>was shattered this whale was hit it must<br>have gone under the ship because its<br>tail fluke was severed which is unusual<br>Brutus whales are listed as nationally<br>critical they have the highest<br>threatened species listing they're the<br>same as Cockapoo they're the same as<br>Maui dolphin<br>they're the same as the ferry turn<br>and that means that we need to pay more<br>attention to them but it also meant that<br>when we knew that they were getting hit<br>and killed by ships at a rate of 2.3<br>whales on average per year<br>so we turned to technology this is Mark<br>Johnson one of my favorite people in the<br>world he's an electrical engineer he did<br>his PhD here at the University of<br>Auckland worked at Woods Hole<br>oceanographic Institute University of<br>Saint Andrews all horse University and<br>he loves making really tricky electronic<br>equipment stick on animals that are not<br>very sticky and collect really cool data<br>I love him he is amazing and he's<br>hilarious so this is the d-tag this is<br>one of the very early versions it's a<br>suction cup it's got four little suction<br>cup feet and then we just plonk it on<br>the whale it allows us to see and hear<br>Beneath the Sea and allows us to see<br>every movement that the whales make and<br>here we are deploying one on our last<br>whale we found the problem<br>the draft of Ships coming into the<br>hauraki Gulf is about 12 meters into the<br>ports of Auckland is about 12 meters<br>brooder's whales which are around 15<br>meters in length spend 91 percent of<br>their time less than one body length<br>below the surface of the water but the<br>hauraki gulf is green it's really<br>productive it's filled with<br>phytoplankton and you often can't see<br>the whales when they just go a couple of<br>meters below the tag revolutionized the<br>conversation<br>it allowed us to understand what they're<br>doing below the water so the top is zero<br>meters down to 20 meters 40 meters the<br>time is in in 24 hours so don't worry<br>too much about that but you can see it<br>goes from about 4 P.M to about 9 pm<br>you'll see the lots of red dots and<br>you'll notice those are activity<br>measures and you'll notice that there's<br>a lot more of them in the daylight hours<br>than later on<br>when we take a little subsection of it<br>you'll see that the whales are very busy<br>going up and down they're very active<br>they're feeding and they're they're<br>super active lunge feeding for food at<br>night time less active they're asleep<br>they're like us they go no nice and then<br>they wake up in the morning and then<br>they're like food and that's it's really<br>that simple the thing is that ships come<br>in and out of the hodaki gulf day and<br>night<br>and at night it's dark no one can see<br>them they're asleep they're not really<br>paying attention and they're very very<br>close to the surface so they're<br>extremely vulnerable to ship strike so<br>understanding these Brave behavioral<br>parameters has been really valuable and<br>all because of the d-tag and maybe we<br>were able to take our understanding of<br>the whales the question I always get<br>like why don't they just get out of the<br>way<br>well there's lots of reasons why not the<br>d-tag showed us that it's a really noisy<br>place and 63 hours of recording there<br>was virtually no time at all where they<br>didn't have the sound of a ship in the<br>background it's the background noise of<br>their lives so they're not paying<br>attention<br>we also were able to model where the<br>whales are in space and time the blue is<br>hot spots for that particular year but<br>brooders whales live in the hauraki Gulf<br>year round they're an unusual whale<br>they're always here they find enough<br>food to live and there's hot spots<br>change regularly so we looked at where<br>the ships were moving we used AIS the<br>automatic information system<br>identification system sorry which the<br>are used for ships to not hit each other<br>again repurposing technology for one<br>purpose for our needs as scientists<br>conservation scientists but we could<br>understand where the main tracks of the<br>ships were<br>basically it came to they couldn't<br>reroute their tracks because whales were<br>going to be wherever they're going to be<br>so they had to slow down there was a lot<br>of discussion about how to do this<br>eventually the shipping industry 30 cut<br>30 companies almost all International<br>very few New Zealand ones developed<br>their own voluntary code of practice<br>they didn't want to be told what to do<br>by the international Maritime<br>organization and to be honest I didn't<br>want legislation being put in place<br>either<br>it was going to be slow and cumbersome<br>and if the whales move which they may<br>well do when it gets warm they move<br>further out in the Gulf then we would<br>have a law where ships had to slow down<br>with no whales in the way and we see<br>that and off the the coast of the United<br>States where ships are slowing but<br>there's no whales because climate change<br>has moved their their food<br>the really nice thing is that they<br>developed this protocol and they use<br>science to inform it it's theirs and<br>they adhere to it so we Revisited did<br>this work because often conservations<br>put in place and no one goes and sees if<br>it worked so when we started in 12<br>2012-13 the ships Will Go On average<br>13.2 knots<br>then in 2014-15 and 1516<br>they were going on average 10 knots it's<br>pretty rare today that a ship goes more<br>than 10 knots every now and then you<br>find one but they have done this<br>voluntarily since 2014 most of the<br>captains don't even know why they go 10<br>knots but they go 10 knots and it's a<br>great conservation win because the risk<br>of lethal ship strike decreased from 51<br>to 26 I think this is one of New<br>Zealand's greatest conservation success<br>stories it was science informed it was a<br>social process everyone was welcome but<br>you had to move forward we set Wales at<br>the center of the discussion it was not<br>about us it was about Wales and that was<br>very important and I learned a lot from<br>that process about conversations I've<br>had since in other spaces we had a core<br>team and we focused on the urgency there<br>are 19 whales alive today that would<br>have been dead if the ships hadn't<br>slowed down I'm so proud of the shipping<br>industry every day I'm proud of them<br>they don't know that if I see them I<br>tell them but it's a really amazing win<br>to thank all those whales that could<br>have been dead<br>with the urgency of the whale I guess<br>main risks of them gone we we focused on<br>more biological questions poo honestly<br>so much wisdom in the Poo we love it<br>nothing more biological than studying<br>poo and this is a little net with some<br>of the Poo scooped up those are little<br>moisted shrimps it's pink poo we became<br>very good at like oh brown and sticky<br>fish pink my SIDS yeah who knew you<br>become a poo expert we rarely see what<br>they eat as I said it's really green so<br>using High throughput gin sequencing<br>techniques to determine the zooplankton<br>community structure was a way also of<br>understanding The Brood as well diet<br>um I worked quite closely with Emma<br>Carroll and Richard O'Rourke and Mary<br>Sewell on this because we were trying to<br>understand the Plankton you can't get<br>funding to study Plankton but you can<br>get funding to study Plankton if it's<br>filtered through a whale we identified<br>over 2 000 species of zooplankton and we<br>found the whales weren't just eating<br>anything that went past their face they<br>actually really like copepods and salps<br>and krill-like things and fish those are<br>their preferred prey even when they're<br>not very abundant<br>and because with Scientists we had spare<br>poo imagine not many people have spare<br>poo so this is like the crop duster<br>visualization of a whale pooping it was<br>going quite quickly so it really came<br>out as a very long string of poop<br>so spear poo more science we're very<br>lucky to have some International<br>visitors and we dreamed up the plastic<br>whale project Emma LED this<br>um with type botska and the plastic<br>whale plastic whale project was about<br>identifying<br>um how much how many microplastics the<br>whales ingested<br>every whale every day in the hauraki<br>Gulf ingests around 3 million<br>microplastics we're able to use our tag<br>data which showed us how many times they<br>gulp well that activity and work out<br>roughly how many they get on a single<br>gulp almost all of these microplastics<br>came from their zooplankton prey now I'm<br>not particularly concerned about the<br>whales ingesting microplastics but I am<br>quite concerned about the zooplankton<br>ingesting microplastics and we think of<br>the hauraki golf as not a really on a<br>global scale nasty highly polluted<br>environment another thing for us all to<br>think about and reflect on my effort<br>moved to the pulse of the golf project<br>which can be described as everything<br>everywhere all at once I was sick of<br>studying single species and I never<br>meant to study cetaceans it really has<br>been by accident I'm really interested<br>in things that join together and<br>is New Zealand's only Marine Park<br>National Park so it's like tongariro<br>National Park it's like the able Tasman<br>if you went into the able Tasman and<br>started just wholesale killing the<br>kiridu what would someone say<br>that would have something to say but we<br>treat the hauraki gulf just like a place<br>that we fish and we hunt and we collect<br>and we drag through the bottom and we<br>throw our rubbish in and our poo goes in<br>it and it's not okay we have to stop it<br>this is a treasure this place is a tonga<br>for us<br>it's also an incredibly biodiverse Rich<br>place of course I study the big things<br>the big things don't exist unless the<br>little things are okay everything I<br>study if the phytoplankton and the<br>zooplankton are not okay or the bent<br>sauce is not okay then the big things<br>aren't okay and I'm a Shameless user of<br>these big things to have those<br>conversations about<br>our marine environment<br>we've moved to using drones because what<br>we are able to tell looking above is<br>much more about what happens in these<br>workups when gannets are diving and<br>dolphins are herding fish and other<br>various species of small plantarists<br>seabirds come along what's happening and<br>so for this we're able to actually tell<br>a lot more about the golf and understand<br>these communities in ways we've never<br>done it before we have big busy<br>communities we have small quiet<br>communities this one gathering around a<br>random giant blob of dead whale don't<br>know where that came from<br>we did aerial surveys<br>This was um Lily and Olivia's research<br>for over 12 month period we flew 22<br>surveys at a height of 152 meters above<br>the sea at a speed of 185 kilometers per<br>hour we did these really amazing surveys<br>of the whole golf in five hour periods<br>Rachel Fuster is the uh the The Wiz<br>behind all the statistics and a lot of<br>this work and I'm always grateful for my<br>long-term working relationship with her<br>she's we're a great team<br>we saw 16 species of seabirds five<br>species of sharks five species of<br>citation and two species of modular Rays<br>the really big ones in our flights it's<br>a dynamic place<br>one thing that we noted though is that<br>we see less and less these events this<br>is a British whale about to come and<br>steal all the fish that the Dolphins<br>were feeding on and it kept doing this<br>and the Dolphins would just get the fish<br>back together and then the whale would<br>do a big loop out the back and come<br>through again they're really not very<br>nice<br>because I marked up a big recorded you<br>know what weird I'd say otherwise<br>they're really like you just see the<br>dolphins and all the birds go oh and the<br>birds sit down and the Dolphins just<br>swim away and she's like<br>most hilarious thing to watch but this<br>is part of their Community these<br>foraging communities over evolutionary<br>time have come together they know what<br>to do they've been doing this long<br>before we arrived but we've had an<br>impact on this so there are three types<br>of communities affectionately known as a<br>b and c we use the data from the whale<br>watch boat it's quite broad scale but<br>very interesting we have fish eating<br>communities without Brutus Wales in the<br>middle to be there's Plankton eating<br>Plankton and fish and then the ones with<br>brood as well as the fish eating<br>communities so you can see there's a<br>variety of different species<br>what we also noted was that the<br>brooder's whales diet changed over a<br>10-year period they went from mainly<br>eating fish to mainly eating zooplankton<br>and that change in diet affected the<br>community so here are our three<br>communities a b and c<br>so a is in the very light blue at the<br>top<br>B is the medium blue and C is the dark<br>blue and you can see across time<br>that we actually have had a significant<br>change in the community structure all<br>because the whales change their diet<br>we pretty much lost Community C it's<br>almost entirely gone those animals had<br>to either find some other community or<br>some other whale way of working together<br>to find prey Community B went up which<br>is probably where many of the community<br>C members went<br>but this is not okay this loss of Modi<br>this loss of energy of this Collective<br>of things that come together in space<br>and time and and show that a place is<br>alive we lost that and that concerns me<br>greatly<br>we moved on from this work to look at<br>social interactions in more detail and<br>there's some really lovely work that<br>Wednesday Davis did for her Masters and<br>we looked at fine scale communities<br>using our own observations and found<br>that there are eight different Community<br>types but they really vary depending on<br>migration paths we have the standard<br>kind of you know gannet fluttering<br>Shearwater common dolphin Community but<br>we have a new community which are the<br>tiny little storm petrols which I found<br>with the brood as well as when they're<br>feeding on zooplankton virtually no<br>other birds hang with them when they're<br>feeding on Plankton so the communities<br>have changed<br>I work in the air has shown where we sit<br>on the boat which is the the picture on<br>the left side<br>is very different to what we see when we<br>look on the right side we have used AI<br>tools to to audit all of the Drone<br>footage well large portions of the Drone<br>footage that we have putting Little<br>Boxes around multiple species of seabird<br>and sedation and behaviors to understand<br>what they're doing<br>this was a massive task undertaken by<br>Wednesday and Athena Brown who did her<br>honors last year on the mantas<br>what we're able to do with this is we<br>can understand detailed interactions and<br>associations this is an early iteration<br>it's not perfect it misses a few things<br>but we can now run a whole video footage<br>we have of a drone through the AI and it<br>will tell us who's there how many of<br>them what they're doing who they're<br>interacting with their behavior<br>everything this is a real game changer<br>and as a behavioral ecologist I couldn't<br>be more excited so this is some of our<br>future work<br>I want to talk now the last project Maui<br>Dolphins this has been a tougher<br>challenge this has been I think the<br>thing that has brought Scott<br>to the most confused I've ever seen him<br>in his life and the most frustrated<br>you know I've I've seen him<br>his knowledge challenged in the high<br>court by fishermen going how can you<br>prove that dolphin's there like why<br>would he lie it's been a highly<br>degrading disrespectful horrible process<br>in the early years and has been very<br>very difficult<br>part of the challenges this is where<br>they live this is a really hard place to<br>get to it's a really dangerous<br>environment most of the time<br>and despite thousands of years of<br>isolation<br>Bowie and hectors look the same but<br>they're genetically very distinct<br>I think I'll try and hopefully this will<br>work<br>go down that one<br>um very distinct when Scott suggested<br>the value of genetic approaches to<br>understanding Moe and Hector's dolphins<br>it was at a crucial Time by catch and<br>recreational and commercial fishing gear<br>mostly set Nets was decimating the<br>populations I remember going into the<br>old biology building and having three<br>Dolphins lying on the ground in there<br>and some of them with net entanglement<br>scars there were more of them coming in<br>than we could keep up with there was a<br>strong resistance by some to using<br>molecular methods mostly to biopsying<br>the animals because we would hurt them<br>this was just beyond<br>comprehension given what was happening<br>happening to them<br>this delay hindered informed action but<br>it was urgently needed to protect the<br>Dolphins and we had a period of eight<br>years where we weren't able to do what I<br>think would have been the best science<br>after many years of delays doc finally<br>got on our side pushed it through<br>and the absence of knowledge there is<br>often uncertainty and misinformation the<br>Maui dolphin is one example we think<br>there has probably been around 300 to<br>500 Maui Dolphins before people came<br>along and started catching them in their<br>Nets<br>monofilament set Nets were introduced in<br>the 1970s<br>by the mid 1980s there was a massive<br>amount of bycatch mortality that was<br>clearly unsustainable<br>there was an abundance estimate using<br>bonus single transact of 134 Dolphins<br>then aerial estimates<br>75. the new Plymouth area where the<br>Dolphins had once been very abundant<br>there was virtually none left they were<br>rarely found and had huge range<br>contraction<br>2002 was the last known Maui dolphin<br>bycatch 2003 an estimate using genetics<br>of 69 Dolphins another estimate for<br>aerial surveys of 111 you'll see really<br>large confidence intervals 2008 the West<br>Coast North Island Marine Sanctuary was<br>put in place we did another estimate in<br>1011 it was 55<br>they expanded the range of protection in<br>2015-16 we did another genetic abundance<br>estimate there were 63 dolphins<br>and in 2020 they extended the range of<br>protection along the west coast<br>and in 20 20 21 we did our most recent<br>estimate of 54. the little dolphins are<br>hanging in there but barely they are the<br>a little bit of skin<br>if we had just driven around and looked<br>at these dolphins and taken photos we're<br>only 15 of them are identifiable by<br>their friend we would know nothing so<br>far we have used our tiny piece of skin<br>for all these purposes many Masters and<br>phds and works in progress and patching<br>together<br>technological advancements to really<br>understand these animals and I'm really<br>proud of what we've done with our little<br>five mil by five mil piece of skin and<br>for most all of them we still have a<br>piece left just in case waiting for that<br>next advancement<br>they have a very uncertain future this<br>photo has about 20 of the known<br>population of this species in the world<br>in it and that's not a very big boat<br>there is wide protection from Fisheries<br>by catch now but there's emerging issues<br>such as toxoplasmosis that originates<br>from cats is proving A new challenge<br>this year we have zero budget from the<br>Department of Conservation to work on<br>Maui Dolphins there is no dollars to<br>work on the world's rarest Marine<br>dolphin<br>I I can't quite understand this but here<br>we are<br>I formed a charitable trust with two of<br>my buddies Willie and tane<br>because New Zealand does not have a<br>survey plane and so we started Maui 63<br>to get a five meter wingspan drone that<br>we can use to develop AI tools which<br>we've done we can identify Maui or<br>Hector's dolphins from they look the<br>same so we don't quite know which one we<br>have but there's life it allows us to<br>find and detect the dolphins in real<br>time the Drone is it's remotely piloted<br>it can fly up to six hours<br>and we're the first drone to be allowed<br>Beyond visual line of sight meaning we<br>don't have to look at our drone when<br>we're piloting it and we've got<br>automated compilation of data location<br>and predictive models we're really<br>pushing this through so where's the Maui<br>in this picture because this is the<br>Drone flying<br>that's right there it is that's it there<br>and you can see there's this little tail<br>it's hidden it's fin it's an exciting<br>future I think with AI revolutionizing<br>my work in Marine Science and behavioral<br>ecology<br>so that's a quick stroll through some of<br>the projects I've been involved in that<br>have really inspired me<br>I thought about things that made me very<br>happy because of course we're not just<br>researchers but there was no way I could<br>fit my research and my teaching and my<br>service into this talk and there were<br>several people who said I can't wait to<br>see a talk you have great pictures and I<br>thought well that's not of my teaching<br>so so here we are so I picked things<br>that recently have made me very very<br>happy<br>my research thing is ramadi's baked<br>whale mesopoladon<br>and yes it has a little in it there's<br>our YouTube page where you can go and<br>have a listen about the story of ramadi<br>Stuart this is ramadi receiving her<br>honorary doctor of science for her work<br>in science as we think of it and as a<br>tohunga tohora who work in matauranga<br>Maori and the support that I got from my<br>heads of Department Dean<br>takaho Hoskin and many other people<br>going yes<br>now is the time this is a perfect reason<br>for an honorary doctor of science that<br>recognize a woman who stands with a foot<br>in Two Worlds<br>I've had ramadi in my research life in<br>New Zealand all my life and this was one<br>of the greatest days<br>Emma Carroll who's just an amazing human<br>being and I'm so grateful that we have<br>hired her because that means I can shove<br>a bunch of my work at no<br>I am grateful she will take the New<br>Zealand citation tissue archive to great<br>places because that's where we sort of<br>discovered Ramirez big trail Ramirez<br>recovered it from a beach we thought it<br>was a true speaked whale which is found<br>in the northern and southern hemisphere<br>and when she found her nihonori she said<br>this one's different there's something<br>about her that's not the same<br>many many years later<br>Emma doing work using genomic tools with<br>a leading a whole bunch of really<br>amazing people throughout the world it's<br>like you're right it's not the same in<br>the southern hemisphere they are<br>different they've been distinct by at<br>least half a million years and probably<br>probably more<br>and that these whales were different and<br>that was when two very scheming women<br>got together and went went aiming it<br>ramadi yes we went to ramadi and we said<br>we would like you to the honor of naming<br>this whale and we would like you to<br>consider that it be named after you and<br>she she talked with her people and um<br>sent some suggestions and she granted<br>our wish that we would could name it<br>after her ramadi is a standalone Maori<br>name before<br>they had surnames and it also means rare<br>or unusual event and I couldn't think of<br>a more fitting name for an amazing woman<br>who we are very lucky to have in our<br>midst<br>my service<br>as being the science advisor for live<br>ocean this is such an honor I've done a<br>lot of service in my time but working<br>with the team at live ocean is just<br>something else they are all inspiring<br>committed to making change this is the<br>charitable Trust of blairchuk and Peter<br>Burling who know that change happens and<br>that they can be change makers and<br>they've gathered around them some of the<br>most amazing people and it's an honor<br>every day to talk with them and to<br>advise them some of them are here today<br>thank you for coming<br>and teaching<br>well it was working with the team to<br>create Marine 100g the oceans around us<br>Mandy Harper was such a legend of this<br>and Murray Ford as well and we created<br>for the time a really Dynamic exciting<br>Innovative course and it's still going<br>and I'm really proud of that and I think<br>my embracing of teaching and joy for<br>teaching is largely thank you to Mandy<br>and also to Judy O'Brien who are great<br>mentors and Judy who always said yes you<br>can bring Alex to class whenever rich<br>and I got stuck baby on my hip giving my<br>lecture and I'm grateful for working at<br>a place that allows that and we must<br>never stop allowing that because it's<br>something that allows us to do our job<br>things I've learned<br>multi-disciplinary approaches are<br>critical and time-sensitive solutions<br>and be comfortable with imperfect<br>information best teams make a difference<br>they might not be who you think should<br>be there but you'll find your best<br>people and work with them move forward<br>set goals remain flexible and inclusive<br>everyone comes with ideas that have<br>Merit<br>always there's almost not a single<br>conversation I've ever had that hasn't<br>been useful in some way or challenged my<br>view of how I think the world looks talk<br>to people who see the world through a<br>different lens it's not about us it's<br>actually not this whole planet including<br>us only functions if we're all in it<br>together and so we need to become more<br>part of rather than other other than<br>put down your piece of the puzzle help<br>others put down their piece of the<br>puzzle and collectively we move forward<br>it's another way of remembering it's not<br>about us you do what you do you do your<br>best you put it down and then you enable<br>others because some enabled you<br>communicate your research however you<br>can it's so important that we have a<br>science literate community and laugh a<br>lot because it really really helps<br>I started writing a thank you<br>acknowledgments list and then I kept<br>forgetting everyone so I'm going to do<br>the thanks you know who you are<br>I would be like is that me is that me<br>yeah all of you but it is it's an<br>unbelievable number of of human and<br>non-human animals that I have been<br>worked with and I've had immense<br>privilege and it's been a lot of fun and<br>all of you here please every day do<br>something for the ocean every day thank<br>you for listening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
