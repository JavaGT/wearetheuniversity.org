and also the people of the waikato<br>being the sacred mountain and waycats<br>albino River we welcome you to the lands<br>which were once occupied and still<br>occupied today<br>and<br>especially here to the University of<br>waikato for those who uh overview who<br>still live around this area and have<br>just come a short way and also for those<br>who have traveled from afar and they<br>will arrive in today and also tomorrow<br>as part of this forum we welcome you<br>acknowledge you and I'll say<br>now hand the time to our vice Chancellor<br>uh<br>foreign<br>welcome everyone uh it's great to see so<br>many of you here despite<br>our first foggy morning of the Year here<br>in Hamilton uh glad that everyone's uh<br>or pretty much everyone has managed to<br>make it<br>and in particular I think the attendance<br>that we have at the Forum this year<br>uh reflects the really challenging<br>circumstances in which we find New<br>Zealand and the world economy at the<br>moment so it's a terrific time for us to<br>be gathered together to talk about some<br>of these challenges and how we manage uh<br>some of the really difficult economic<br>trade-offs that we're confronting at the<br>moment<br>so we we have on the program<br>quite a number of the key areas of<br>Interest covered and in particular<br>for me I think it's really important<br>that we have a discussion on the program<br>both about the labor market<br>and in addition of course we'll also<br>have a panel talking about inflation<br>and other aspects of of the economy<br>including productivity I'm interested<br>obviously in the relationship between<br>inflation and the labor market and the<br>challenges that that's providing for us<br>at the moment<br>we're in a situation where through the<br>latter part of the pandemic and over the<br>last year demand in the economy has been<br>very resilient our supply chain problems<br>have gradually been resolved but<br>obviously inflation is too high and<br>there are key elements of the economy<br>which I think not only feel to us but<br>our demonstr demonstrably unsustainable<br>so by comparison with the period uh<br>pre-covered when<br>we had very moderate inflation and that<br>was a combination of very constrained<br>tradables inflation<br>and<br>non-tradable inflation which was pretty<br>well contained through quite a long<br>period of time we're now in a situation<br>where of course we have inflation as a<br>global phenomenon so we've been<br>importing inflation and in addition it's<br>clear now that we have a domestic<br>inflation issue that we need to Grapple<br>with as well<br>well that's important because of course<br>we know<br>monetary policy has a really important<br>part to play in dealing with those<br>challenges with inflation<br>but as I'm sure you'd all agree we don't<br>want monetary policy having to do all of<br>the work to deal with the inflation<br>problem that we have because the<br>interest rate and other implications of<br>The Reserve Bank having to do all of the<br>work to deal with the challenges we have<br>at the moment<br>really serious they would have very<br>significant implications for all of the<br>interest rate sensitive parts of the<br>economy and not obviously ideal in terms<br>of how we manage our way out of the<br>current challenges that we have<br>so one of the key problems we have at<br>the moment with<br>our<br>domestic non-tradable inflation but of<br>course uh it's a phenomenon that you see<br>in most of the developed countries as<br>well<br>is that we have shortage of Labor the<br>labor market by The Reserve bank's<br>calculation is tighter than it's been<br>since 2007<br>and the result of that is<br>incomes being pushed up both through<br>wage and salary increases when people<br>stay in jobs but also through a very<br>high turnover as people move jobs to get<br>higher incomes and the costs that are<br>created for both public and private<br>sector organizations with those very<br>high rates of turnover in our labor<br>so the leader in The Economist magazine<br>of last week posed the question you know<br>can we actually bring inflation under<br>control when labor markets continue to<br>be as tight as they are now and of<br>course that really is a key challenge<br>for us<br>uh in the past New Zealand obviously has<br>relieved labor market pressure through<br>migration<br>and one of the challenges we have at the<br>moment is that we've been through a<br>period during the pandemic with the<br>borders closed and with both<br>attitudes as well as our policy towards<br>migration changing<br>so if you ask anybody who's a<br>significant employer around New Zealand<br>they will tell you how difficult it is<br>to get people in from overseas to fill<br>our our shortages in in our Workforce<br>so in the short term we're struggling<br>with the traditional migration release<br>valve that New Zealand has had in the<br>past<br>we could<br>of course<br>hope that<br>non-tradable inflation even if it<br>continues<br>will be reduced by tradable inflation<br>falling substantially<br>but it's unlikely that a significant<br>reduction in tradable inflation such as<br>would impact on the domestic economy in<br>that way is going to occur in the<br>international economy without the<br>um the impact that we would expect it to<br>have on New Zealand as well we're not<br>insulated from international events and<br>indeed the non-tradable tradable<br>inflation correlation has got greater in<br>recent years According to some work that<br>we've had done at the Reserve Bank in<br>the labor market of course could adjust<br>By changes in the way firms operate and<br>the way organizations operate we could<br>get used in other words through<br>structural adjustments to having less<br>labor but that's also extremely<br>challenging to achieve in the short term<br>so in the meantime we have some real<br>challenges to deal with in New Zealand<br>challenges that are the greater because<br>many other developed countries are<br>having to deal with them as well and<br>that means that there is no easy path<br>and no easy transition from the<br>international economy to addressing some<br>of our challenges<br>so that's uh my opportunity uh again to<br>say that I think it's really an<br>important time for us to be talking<br>about these things<br>I welcome the work that my colleagues at<br>the University have done in pulling<br>together this forum Matt and Frank and<br>your team<br>it's it's great program a great lineup<br>of people in the room to discuss all of<br>the issues<br>exactly the right time as we debate all<br>these issues and as they'll no doubt be<br>debated quite broadly as we move into an<br>election in the latter part of the year<br>to have this discussion and led a good<br>spectrum of views be put on the table as<br>they will be today and tomorrow so<br>everyone thank you again for being here<br>I really look forward to the discussion<br>over the next day and a half thank you<br>foreign<br>welcome to the University of waikato my<br>name is Matt Bulger I'm the pro Vice<br>Chancellor of the waikato management<br>in the 1930s the renowned British<br>economist John Maynard Keynes was<br>apparently sitting in a parliamentary<br>panel and he was being challenged for<br>changing his mind on a certain policy<br>issue<br>and he famously replied<br>well the information I've received has<br>changed when that happens I changed my<br>mind<br>what do you do<br>there are enough economists in the room<br>to know that that story may be<br>apocryphal it's actually attributed to<br>many different economists now but the<br>reason for that of course is because the<br>point is so valid when the information<br>changes<br>should we hold on to our old beliefs or<br>should we challenge them of course we<br>should challenge them<br>over the next two days you're going to<br>hear from a wide range of speakers<br>front on a really wide range of topics<br>and chatting to people in the foia<br>earlier every item that you look at on<br>this agenda from immigration to crowd<br>Maori relations uh geopolitics and<br>relationships with China to labor<br>markets monetary policy all of them feel<br>even more topical today than maybe even<br>we're meeting in challenging times when<br>we started the New Zealand economics<br>Forum two years ago we called it<br>economics for tumultuous times dealing<br>with a post-covered world that was March<br>2021 and calling a forum post covert<br>World in March 2021 now looks a little<br>bit optimistic hopeful<br>uh last year we couldn't meet it's only<br>12 months ago it was an online<br>experience<br>and we did it over live stream and<br>overnight<br>just as we came into our session on<br>geopolitics with Tim grosser and Rodney<br>Jones only six or seven hours before the<br>tanks had started rolling into the<br>Ukraine<br>uh only 12 months ago now of course we<br>meet against the backdrop of very tight<br>labor markets cost of living also<br>geopolitical tensions that have morphed<br>and evolved<br>and of course the extreme weather events<br>in the last week and I know that many in<br>the room here will have been personally<br>affected or your wider whanau network<br>will have been affected by those and<br>need some of our our speakers to a<br>severely Nigel Bickel is unable to join<br>us given his leadership role in the<br>Hawke's Bay and so many of you will be<br>dealing with that and of course it adds<br>an extra challenge to an already<br>challenging policy environment<br>so<br>given this the most disappointing thing<br>would be to walk through those doors<br>after a day and a half<br>and have exactly the same views and<br>beliefs that you had when you walked in<br>through them 10 or 15 minutes ago<br>Jim<br>and uh<br>I think the challenge for all of us then<br>is to listen to this with an open mind<br>and an open heart to listen try to<br>absorb information<br>and not leave here hoping to have more<br>ammunition more statistics more stories<br>to use to fortify our own beliefs to win<br>arguments in the future actually to<br>challenge some of our own beliefs<br>debates disagreements intellectual<br>curiosity those are absolutely critical<br>for a high functioning society and one<br>of the main reasons we started this<br>forum is because New Zealand New Zealand<br>needs more opportunities for that kind<br>universities of course are absolutely<br>essential to that kind of debate through<br>the research they create but also<br>through the environment they allow for<br>the development of critical thinking<br>this is first week of classes Monday<br>back on campus I only joined the<br>university world two years ago this is<br>the busiest I've ever seen campus it's<br>just fantastic to see all of the<br>students signing up for their clubs<br>walking across the lawn making new<br>friends really brilliant chatting to<br>International students who are trying to<br>find the student center for the first<br>time and knowing what a difference<br>University can make in their lives it's<br>incredibly inspiring we're very proud of<br>the University of waikato and Taro Papa<br>the waikato management School we're<br>ranked number one in New Zealand for<br>business and economics on the global<br>times higher rankings ranked number one<br>for economics and the latest round of<br>the pbrf the government's<br>performance-based research funding<br>and ranks adjusted for size number 35 in<br>the world for economics which is about<br>three spots behind Yale but a couple<br>above NYU so I'm not an economist but<br>you're in good hands<br>the uh into the mechanics then before we<br>get into our first session so there will<br>be a roaming mic and would encourage<br>questions from the floor the speakers<br>will of course make some statements but<br>this is intended to be a discussion it's<br>a small enough group for that there is<br>also the slido app there's a piece of<br>paper on every table<br>and if you're watching on the live<br>stream you can just click the button<br>feeds questions through the slido app to<br>myself as a facilitator or a professor<br>Anna Strutt who will be joining me as a<br>facilitator for some of the sessions and<br>we will pass those on to the speakers as<br>we can<br>the program today we're going to have a<br>couple of sessions this morning we start<br>with a review of the covert response but<br>also topically given the last month<br>thinking about what we can do to be<br>prepared for next time next time doesn't<br>necessarily need to be a pandemic or<br>even a health response but what can we<br>do to be prepared for extreme events I<br>will then be joined by Deputy leader of<br>the opposition Nicola Willis whose plane<br>has landed I've been informed so<br>positive on the fog story there Neil and<br>then into lunch just after 12. as I say<br>I will come back for a session on<br>immigration and apologies I pass on from<br>to a severely Nigel Bickel also pass on<br>apologies from government ministers we<br>worked very hard with the previous prime<br>minister's office at the back half of<br>last year uh wondered wondered why she<br>might have been hedging her bits as to<br>whether she could make it back to her<br>old University to speak at this event<br>and of course we found out maybe why in<br>January but the combination of a change<br>of leader and the National Emergency<br>events means that the Prime Minister and<br>Minister of Finance were unable to speak<br>at this event this time<br>so the last thing is coffees are out<br>there bathrooms are out there those are<br>the two most important things The Great<br>Outdoors are out the back if there's an<br>emergency and let's get into it you if<br>you haven't downloaded the slido app<br>then um please do so and otherwise we<br>will start the first program<br>so I'll welcome up to the stage<br>two of our three speakers<br>so we're this first pro the first item<br>on the program is the review of our<br>covert response and looking at lessons<br>for next time so Rob Fife is about to<br>join us he's uh he's got a background on<br>airlines so he's going to make a flying<br>entrance very shortly Rob of course well<br>known as the former CEO of Air New<br>Zealand in one of New Zealand's Business<br>Leaders who is also the government<br>appointed liaison for the covert<br>response but liaison between business<br>and government<br>uh cariana Brooking who's a partner at<br>PWC uh based in the Hawke's Bay but<br>previously spent a significant part of<br>her career and the Ministry of Health<br>both inside the the central response and<br>a little bit further outside and Adrian<br>littlewood the former CEO of Auckland<br>Airport and if we consider businesses<br>that were maybe at the front line of<br>some of those early covert days then of<br>course the airport was one of them so<br>welcome to the stage kittiana and Adrian<br>obviously<br>um Rob will be with us shortly but I<br>thought I might you know if we frame<br>this up a little bit between the two of<br>you and Rob you all obviously had<br>quite different roles going through the<br>covered experience kiriana you were<br>right in the center of it you were<br>outside for a while and then back in and<br>we might ask you to explain some of that<br>Adrian you were right at the front line<br>in one sense but probably a bit further<br>away from some of you know the the<br>centralized model and then Rob was a<br>bridge between the two so I'll hand over<br>to each of you to just I guess make the<br>the key points you want to for a few<br>minutes and then we'll open it up to the<br>discussion I'll start with you kirian<br>foreign<br>even though I'm sitting the whakatoki is<br>it's on the heels of your feet where you<br>make your stand<br>and the words of the Carpenters covert<br>sometimes seems long ago and oh so far<br>away<br>um but if we look at the latest figures<br>there are still around 1300 Active cases<br>of coverage in aotearoa today<br>um just want to give you a little bit of<br>uh context about<br>um the health system at the time and a<br>lot of this you'll be familiar with so<br>2019 through to 2020 uh the health<br>system responded to<br>five Emergency Management responses so<br>there was the Christchurch terrorist<br>attack<br>there was measles there was measles in<br>the Pacific island there was fakari<br>white Island and then there was covert<br>19. so all of those things had massive<br>impacts on a number of people but not<br>all at once and not everywhere in New<br>Zealand<br>I think the second thing is when covert<br>arrived globally<br>um there was so much about the science<br>that was not yet understood<br>and it sweeps globally and was on the<br>doorstep of New Zealand in quite a quick<br>Pace while the science was still being<br>worked through<br>um I worked in the Ministry of Health as<br>a deputy director General<br>um and in<br>January of that year we thought we were<br>pretty amazing just getting the people<br>from Wuhan<br>um over to whangaparaoa and finding<br>enough motorhomes for them all to stay<br>in<br>and we kind of said wasn't that a great<br>job and let's be honest that was step<br>1.1.1.8 of what actually eventuated in<br>aotearoa in relation to covert<br>so I um was asked by Ashley in February<br>and I remember it distinctly I was<br>leaning up on a wall outside the<br>Emergency Center some of you have heard<br>the story Ashley had gone down to<br>invercargill<br>to watch his sons in the pipe band<br>competition he'd made a last minute<br>decision to go and the only beard he<br>could get was in a Backpackers in a shed<br>room<br>um he decided in that weekend that we<br>needed to really go big or go home on<br>how we were doing the setup for covert<br>and he rung me and asked me if I would<br>be the dce covered and that's the role<br>that I played from February 2020 to July<br>2020 and then I left to become the chief<br>executive of Hawke's Bay District Health<br>Board and so it was really interesting<br>for me I got to see the consequences of<br>decisions made and thought about in the<br>center<br>and the impact of that on a region like<br>Hawke's Bay a place where I still live<br>today<br>um I just want to remind you of some<br>things and they are things that you all<br>know and have probably just tucked into<br>the um back of your mind you know it was<br>late February when we have to 2020 when<br>we had our first case and then very<br>quickly uh we uh were going through as a<br>country that we were asking people to<br>suffer isolate we started closing the<br>borders<br>um we very quickly introduced the levels<br>we went through a whole series of items<br>as a country and we got ourselves<br>through to June 2020 where we thought<br>yeah we're done pretty good<br>we were getting this rolling mole of<br>tinakoto Couture there are no cases in<br>New Zealand today<br>I've likened those 1pm stand-ups to when<br>um I used to ring my mother when<br>Coronation Street was on<br>she used to say coronation Street's on<br>and then she'd hang up never rang anyone<br>in New Zealand during those stand-ups<br>and then we thought by 8th of June we've<br>done a not too bad job and then on the<br>11th of August 2024 cases in the<br>community were reported<br>um on the 11th of August uh 2020 is<br>actually the day that I was welcomed to<br>Hawke's Bay District Health Board<br>um we had Ashley in attendance<br>um I'm was the only uh wahine Maori<br>District Health Board chief executive in<br>the 21 years the health boards were in<br>existence so every Maori known to man<br>had turned out to my poor finish we had<br>probably about 400 people there Dr Nick<br>Jones that evening when they announced<br>we were going uh back into a level three<br>rung me in a panic that he thought we'd<br>created a super spreader event but that<br>was not to be<br>um I think the three things I just want<br>to um say in closing is you know what do<br>I reflect on for next time and for us in<br>Hawke's Bay it feels like we are in next<br>time<br>right now<br>um the thing for me about covert in<br>particular the reality of the way new<br>zealanders lived and worked here and<br>overseas was underappreciated or it was<br>an accepted risk<br>there is a consequence of immediate<br>public policy clicking into a gear<br>people got stuck on both sides of the<br>closed door<br>and the school base and the social<br>Fabric and the message the closed door<br>said still reverberates today<br>the second thing is that communities can<br>make it work if they have sufficient<br>resources and good infrastructure<br>and we saw some amazing examples of how<br>communities in covert<br>worked really well together and I think<br>about matakawa the top of the East Coast<br>they were<br>um you know they<br>they treated the public policy as<br>guidance but they really worked out how<br>to make it work for them<br>we find ourselves in Hawkes Bay working<br>out how we're doing community resilience<br>with the lack of infrastructure<br>that we're experiencing right now so<br>there's two kind of elements that have<br>to work in sync and what happens when<br>they get out of sync<br>and then I think the last thing is that<br>um in August 2021 we went back again<br>into alert level four<br>and did we really learn enough<br>between those two years<br>to lessen the blunt of blunt force of<br>public policy on economy and available<br>social license<br>and for those aucklanders in the room<br>and the long uh cold uh spring in summer<br>of 2021 will forever stay in their in<br>their minds and what lessons are<br>commonly agreed now that we don't<br>actually need a royal Commission of<br>inquiry to point them out<br>that would be my final comment tinakai<br>day<br>thanks Matt um and endorse a lot of what<br>cariana said I thought I'd just start<br>with a quick quote um and if you excuse<br>the rather clumsy metaphor at the start<br>of this um like hand sanitizer and a<br>paper cut covid-19 exposed the cracks in<br>our health social economic government<br>and political systems virus exacerbated<br>pre-existing vulnerabilities and the<br>pandemic impacted all of us but its<br>burden was not equally shared that's the<br>opening line from the Independent review<br>into Australia's covered response but I<br>think those words are equally relevant<br>to here and I think it is right and<br>proper to both acknowledge what went<br>well uh in the early stage of the<br>pandemic response and carrier I touched<br>on that but also recognize there are<br>things that we need to learn for next<br>time and we must do better and I feel<br>really strongly about this I think we<br>owe it to our kids and our grandkids<br>that we must not let these things pass<br>from our memory and they pass very<br>quickly we write them down we learn from<br>them and get them done better next time<br>because this will come again<br>and encephalocular when I was at<br>Auckland Airport as Matt said we were<br>obviously a private organization but we<br>were at the the front line along with<br>our border agencies and Airlines for the<br>entire period of covert so we had covert<br>in our business every day from day one<br>so I remember sitting in uh Grant<br>Robin's office with Kelvin Davis giving<br>them a briefing on what was happening in<br>China in January<br>of 2020 uh and in a cascader from there<br>Italy Iran shut down China shut down<br>repatriation then into the entire border<br>being shut down so we lived with it<br>every day in our organization and<br>learned to adapt uh quite quickly and so<br>I think we can now we'll see those early<br>phases of the covert response uh as a<br>period of classic crisis management you<br>know you're dealing with imperfect<br>information you're responding quickly<br>you are trying to Marshal resources and<br>I think those early days we got those<br>things broadly right and there were some<br>scratchy edges around it naturally it's<br>going to happen<br>but I think the thing that really sticks<br>with me looking back on it uh was the<br>sense of stasis that sort of occurred<br>over time<br>I can recount many times being on calls<br>with people in Wellington with<br>politicians with others where<br>my sense of frustration grew over time<br>is this sense of the things we are<br>sharing with you it doesn't feel like<br>you're listening hearing or responding<br>to in a way that is helping us to<br>continue to be better and yes things are<br>always Dynamic and changing but when you<br>can see things occurring<br>which were known months ago being<br>repeated over and over again and this<br>increasing separation between is getting<br>I touched on the separation between what<br>was happening in Wellington and what was<br>seeing around the country particularly<br>in Auckland I think was<br>disheartening uh at the same time there<br>was a feeling that many of us could help<br>to play a stronger role uh and it got to<br>the point where that frustration sort of<br>tripped over into a sense of we have to<br>take some of these actions on our own to<br>get things happening<br>um and I can I can reflect on<br>mini exam beer experience and resources<br>that we had that were not easily<br>available to Wellington or found to be<br>very hard for the health establishment<br>or the response to do and I'll just pick<br>up a couple of those examples so<br>um I think the park and ride vaccination<br>site we ended up setting up the largest<br>vaccination site in New Zealand in New<br>Zealand we did that through a bit of<br>bloody mindedness uh as well as some<br>incredible uh Health people on the<br>ground who just decided that they were<br>going to lead it and make it happen<br>um we did that with the door-to-door<br>proposal we gather together experts from<br>New Zealand and Auckland businesses who<br>had experience in going door-to-door<br>with sales experience and Mish targeting<br>around who was most at risk in the<br>community and we offered buses up and we<br>had unique buses and I say buses in the<br>real sense of these uh Park and Ride<br>buses that are specially built for<br>passengers with Luggage So are open and<br>really suited vaccination status and<br>when I rang the health people and said<br>you know why aren't we using the buses<br>and going to Dorado I said well we can't<br>get the buses available because they're<br>all passenger buses but we have six<br>buses and drivers that can be deployed<br>tomorrow and they said oh that's great<br>let's do it and that happened instantly<br>we had it available<br>right down to the rat tests and if you<br>remember back and I'll ask you to<br>remember back to um the almost<br>um<br>I really don't understand the difference<br>between what happened on testing but uh<br>on rat testing again through sheer<br>bloody mindedness we gathered together<br>20 odd 30 odd New Zealand companies who<br>just said we will commit to ordering rat<br>test I rang the head of ebos and said<br>can you go and get us a couple hundred<br>thousand reps he said yeah I can have<br>them next week<br>uh but we had to have<br>highly committed people in Wellington uh<br>walk their decision through the<br>Wellington bureaucracy to get that<br>signed off because there was a real<br>resistance to getting those tests into<br>the place and my argument was always we<br>are running a business every day with<br>covert an hour in our business we need<br>to keep our staff safe we need to have<br>tools that are available that aren't<br>relying on a a 24 hour wait for a PCR<br>result<br>and so those are just some small<br>vignettes about where I think<br>um taking a whole of New Zealand<br>response to these kind of crises is<br>really important<br>um you cannot I don't believe manage the<br>scale of a covert or a pandemic like<br>that through the lens of a narrow lens<br>that lens needs to keep widening and and<br>classic crisis Incident Management<br>response tells you and it's in the in<br>the documentation is you must be<br>adaptable flexible and maintain the<br>trust and confidence of the community<br>and I think you can only do that through<br>getting the whole of country response<br>because the government is not the whole<br>of the country<br>uh and and I think those responses uh in<br>the future will be far better and I'm<br>heartened and carry on and I were<br>talking about this in terms of the<br>immediate response to what's happening<br>in Hawke's Bay is there is I heard an<br>immediate response to say we need to get<br>business involved in response and I<br>think that took too long to come about<br>and I'm sure when Rob gets here he'll be<br>able to talk to that given he was at<br>that eight or that intersect between<br>government and business I think it is a<br>critical point for that future<br>computer thinks Adrian and uh nice segue<br>because over your shoulder uh Rob has<br>arrived so welcoming uh Rob Fife to the<br>stage killer and uh as we know rob you<br>played a critical role Bridging the<br>worlds of government-led response and<br>the business Community we talked a<br>little bit about you know kittiana's<br>background having been inside Wellington<br>then then outside Adrian really at the<br>front line from January onwards<br>um tell us a little bit about your<br>experience in in your points before we<br>get into the questions which I see some<br>coming through already now<br>uh yeah I kind of look back actually<br>and I got involved<br>ultimately because I was a protagonist<br>outside government making quite a bit of<br>noise back in<br>early March 2020 though I thought the<br>government wasn't moving fast enough<br>um<br>and found myself in a conversation with<br>a number of business people<br>and the Prime Minister<br>um<br>discussing that very issue<br>I kind of got nominated as a<br>spokesperson I think I was the poorest<br>person in the room<br>conversation<br>and at the end of that call their prime<br>minister said well how about one of you<br>come down to Wellington and actors that<br>go between<br>between the government and business as<br>we tackle this challenge<br>and there's Stony silence on the phone<br>call<br>and I guess for me I've always tried to<br>stay pretty clear of government to be<br>honest<br>um<br>I've kind of felt the further removed<br>you are the more you can get on and run<br>your business with minimal interference<br>and I guess interaction<br>so I don't really understand how<br>Wellington worked and in fact<br>two weeks into being down there I spent<br>nine weeks I went down there two days<br>before the first lockdown and spent the<br>lock down in Wellington<br>a couple of weeks into it<br>I rang uh John Key<br>and I see John can you please try and<br>help me understand how you get anything<br>done in this place<br>and we spent about an hour on the phone<br>and after an hour as none the wiser<br>um<br>which probably summed up a lot of my<br>experience actually I relied on people<br>like kiriana to be my navigator at<br>um<br>ambivalent<br>I just positioned those five issues up<br>front because I think they'll stimulate<br>quite a bit of conversation<br>one of the big issues for me<br>that completely blew me away<br>degree to which misinformation<br>I mean the number of times I had<br>untrue and accurate and the momentum of<br>which that gathered steam is a pandemic<br>progressed<br>just put me completely off guard<br>and I think you know the number one<br>issue for me as I look to the future if<br>we had another another of these events<br>is that information management and how<br>you build genuine<br>independent trusted sources of the truth<br>it's it's critical<br>to guiding our way through this<br>we ended up with an incredibly<br>centralized decision-making<br>infrastructure everything<br>uh was centralized pretty much into the<br>Ministry of Health in Wellington<br>I think it<br>well that organization grew<br>to be several thousand<br>of Health<br>and turned it into this All-Seeing all<br>controlling all commanding<br>organization that ran both policy<br>critical decision-making operations<br>and actually in the process became a<br>massive<br>also need for decision making she<br>excluded a lot of people from that<br>decision-making process because it was<br>um<br>I I think also and and I heard Adrian<br>touching on it<br>you know because of<br>that centralized decision-making process<br>we ultimately lacked agility<br>we did a tremendous job I think early on<br>I mean covert<br>this is a classic story right had a<br>beginning a medal and an end<br>I think we did the beginning uh really<br>well<br>we're in the Inn now which is living<br>with covert which was ultimately<br>probably predictable where we would<br>uh where we would end up<br>at the middle the transition between the<br>is that better right awesome<br>um and and ultimately through that uh<br>process of lack of agility<br>the virus evolved and we didn't and we<br>became trapped in a strategy that I<br>guess progressively became less and less<br>uh fit for purpose<br>uh two other points I just wanted to<br>um<br>I guess the other uh the other issue and<br>I've experienced this myself being<br>involved in in managing uh crises<br>as we became very very consumed by the<br>the daily operational Vortex of the<br>crisis<br>case numbers deaths vexing numbers the<br>waitlist and miq everyone right up to<br>the very very highest levels of<br>government was all fixated on the on the<br>daily operational issues<br>and as a consequence<br>the effort that was going into the<br>longer term planning and the strategy<br>and where the off-ramp was out of our<br>elimination strategy and so on<br>we probably were<br>allocating far less resource to that<br>forward planning than we were to just<br>and then finally uh you know the point<br>we pride ourselves I think on a nation<br>of as a nation on being very kind of can<br>do<br>and I think in covert we became very<br>can't do<br>ultimately and we were constantly<br>finding reasons not to do things our<br>elimination strategy made us inherently<br>very very risk-averse because the idea<br>was we had to trap every possible Vector<br>of the virus coming in to protect the<br>community to maintain this position of<br>elimination<br>that faucets have become so risk-averse<br>as I say everything became a reason why<br>we shouldn't do things rather than<br>looking for ways to get things done<br>so I just sort of position up front they<br>were my kind of five as I looked to the<br>question that was posed this this panel<br>of saying what can we learn for a future<br>such event I think there's a lot of<br>discovery that needs to happen in those<br>five areas where we could do a lot lot<br>better next time around<br>Cura thanks Rob and thanks I'm seeing<br>some<br>some very interesting questions coming<br>through I'll get to the one on liberal<br>I might start here actually with you rob<br>to keep going one of the big things that<br>came out of that discussion was about<br>evolution of the response can you talk<br>to us about<br>it's just what you touched on in the end<br>how did it evolve or didn't it evolve<br>and for those of us most in this room<br>they were a lot further removed<br>what part of the organization was<br>working on the response rather than in<br>the response was there a constant sense<br>you know if I look at the various uh<br>layers<br>um there was a lot of pushing from<br>uh outside the Ministry of Health to<br>constantly look at evolving our um our<br>approach<br>and that was coming from the Prime<br>Minister and cabinet it's coming from<br>the business Community it was coming<br>from the Maori community in ewe it was<br>coming from the Pacific Island community<br>we became ultimately<br>and this is my view and as I say this is<br>partly a retrospective it wasn't always<br>visible at the time but<br>we became a prisoner to our elimination<br>strategy what ostensibly happened we<br>were pursuing the strategy we were one<br>of the very few countries in the world<br>that was pursuing that strategy and I<br>think we convinced ourselves that a lot<br>of the learnings internationally<br>went relevant to us because they weren't<br>pursuing the same strategy we were<br>pursuing so it wasn't easy to directly<br>transfer and translate those learnings<br>and those insights I mean rat test was a<br>classic example you know the view was<br>we needed a testing regime that would<br>pick up every single instance of the<br>virus<br>rectus weren't as accurate therefore<br>they weren't really relevant to an<br>elimination strategy because you<br>couldn't afford any single Vector for<br>the virus to come in so so we shut down<br>a lot of sources of potential Innovation<br>and evolution because we defined our our<br>approach to dealing with the virus is<br>relatively novel therefore we had to<br>develop our own our own insights in our<br>own Solutions so we became very<br>introspective as a country certainly<br>within the ministry in terms of looking<br>at how we could uh we could adapt and I<br>think ultimately<br>you know that that was a limitation for<br>us you know I look at saliva testing it<br>was proven in an operation kind of 18<br>months before we were allowed to use it<br>in New Zealand and then we hamstrung the<br>capability rat testing was the same a<br>number of the decisions at the border<br>were the same and you know Adrian can<br>talk to that very eloquently<br>uh I I think our mindset became one of<br>you know we have to chart our own path<br>through this and if I look from a<br>business perspective you know all our<br>best Innovations and our learnings<br>always come from looking at what others<br>are doing and trying to import that into<br>our organization and we lost that<br>opportunity somehow in this process yeah<br>great spell on that because I think that<br>Devolution point is important but uh<br>that sort of sense of the mortgage on<br>ideas coming from the center was really<br>you know shut up many places but I<br>remember one example where I was<br>briefing a senior a very senior Minister<br>about the work we were doing across<br>actually government and private sector<br>led by customs and MIT and so what we<br>were looking at was the future border<br>model uh in a risk-adjusted way<br>reflecting New Zealand's elimination<br>strategy remember sitting in with that<br>Minister and given the briefing and<br>saying look we've got a great model here<br>you know cross-government business<br>um<br>and his comment to me was uh yeah we<br>need we need to go and think about that<br>or I need to go and think about that and<br>it really struck me which is when I see<br>something actually you don't need to<br>worry about it give us the problem we'll<br>go and work on it and come back to you<br>as the decision maker uh with a proposal<br>and you can decide but you don't need to<br>work it out so I think that sort of<br>sense of centralization which was<br>accommodation I think of risk and the<br>sort of sense of New Zealand's<br>elimination strategy was so unique that<br>the ideas could only come from One<br>Source I think did limit us and it<br>stopped us sort of dealing in a sensible<br>way for some of the things I think could<br>have been dealt with in the 21 year<br>um that took much longer than it should<br>of the resolve it's really interesting<br>for those if anybody's got a question uh<br>just please raise your hand but do wait<br>for the microphone to come to you just<br>for those on the live stream so if<br>anybody has got a question please please<br>raise and I'll keep going for now<br>um staying with you Adrian because<br>obviously you're at the<br>you're at the front door of New Zealand<br>and so inherently connected to responses<br>all around the world<br>what were you seeing happening on the<br>international scene that you thought we<br>should have learned from earlier or<br>maybe examples where we did and we we<br>did adopt those things well I think Rob<br>touching this testing was was a really<br>obvious one we just and I won't go over<br>there too much again but that was a<br>clear example uh I think there were<br>other issues around risk-based approach<br>to managing the movement of people from<br>different destinations or uh uh origin<br>points uh and and the sort of sense that<br>there was no other answer than the<br>eliminate and and put through miq and I<br>think<br>um so so there were plenty of examples<br>like that and that that frustrated I<br>think a lot uh and it also had very high<br>personal costs I think uh you know I<br>think we could have and probably know<br>more about this than me but I think we<br>could have moderated or modulated our<br>miq response in a different way based on<br>a more risk-adjusted approach would have<br>which would have lessened the the social<br>cost of some of those measures<br>maturely than it otherwise had<br>um and so I think picking the best as<br>Rob said from around the world and<br>applying it to our local context I think<br>is the right thing to do and it just it<br>was a little bit like wading through<br>treacle to get people to listen to<br>reflect on and sort of say yes that<br>sounds like a great idea let's go and<br>work on it but we were working it by<br>asking the you know the private sector<br>as well as the public sector to work<br>together on what those answers might be<br>that that was felt like a real<br>resistance um<br>jump in there a perfect contrast for me<br>is um in the March 2020 alert level four<br>I left the Ministry of Health uh<br>building the day we went into lockdown<br>um I had a apartment in Hill Street so<br>two blocks away and I walked and um it<br>was dark there were no cars and there<br>were no other people on the street so I<br>was going uphill Street and a homeless<br>person popped out of the pathway from<br>the back of parliament onto Hill Street<br>and we both gave each other a fright<br>um because we were the only two people<br>um it felt like in thorndon on the<br>street at that time and she said what's<br>happening<br>and I said what's up she goes what's<br>happening I said we're in lockdown about<br>what<br>and so we had a a wee chat and I said to<br>her have you got somewhere to go tonight<br>she said yeah I'm sorted I'm sorted she<br>said it's a bit weird eh not having<br>anybody around I said yeah that's true<br>that's true uh August the 12th I wake up<br>in Hawke's Bay and I drive myself from<br>Hawke's Bay to Hastings Hospital and we<br>have determined in Hawke's Bay that<br>everybody's an essential worker<br>because we've got so much going on in<br>Hawke's Bay that means our economy needs<br>to thrive that I probably only saw 20<br>less people on the road than I did<br>um than I did the day before<br>so we had worked through what it meant<br>in Hawke's Bay<br>to live within the parameters of a<br>lockdown but make sure that we could<br>I'm gonna stay with you because really<br>interesting question now from the the<br>health background<br>in retrospect do you think do you<br>consideration was given to some of the<br>health trade-offs so obviously there's<br>economic there's there's social but uh<br>impact of delaying elective surgeries<br>treatments impact on mental health and<br>even can you give us a picture into some<br>of those discussions that were happening<br>around this obviously it would have been<br>discussed<br>yeah so I think<br>um<br>it was clear to everybody that there is<br>a Primacy around the public health<br>policy and there was kind of layering<br>within the health policy so Public<br>Health policy what that meant for us to<br>um a respond to a public health matter<br>and then based on a number of the<br>incredibly alarming uh stories we saw in<br>other parts of the world around their<br>health response to people who had<br>covered it was quite<br>um concerning about our ability as a<br>health system to be able to push that<br>many people through Primary Care push<br>that many people through hospitals<br>um and so that was the second layer of<br>if you remember at the start everyone<br>was worried and we still counted how<br>many ventilators we had in New Zealand<br>and how many ICU beds everyone talked<br>about the tip but we really needed to<br>talk about the base<br>um equally as much and<br>um there was<br>um there was a and then the next layer<br>then was what were we missing out on and<br>preventative care because equally there<br>were<br>um uh<br>acute sorry there was a planned care<br>that could be down hips and knees but<br>they're a woman who haven't had cervical<br>smears there are children that haven't<br>had immunizations so I get that the plan<br>care is important to<br>um a lot of new zealanders and it<br>affects a lot of whanau but there's a<br>very massive base of preventative health<br>care that also we will spend I think a<br>generation catching up on<br>um what I what I would say<br>um is those things consider were<br>considered but Public Health policy took<br>Primacy<br>um and<br>um if I just speak with my uh former<br>Hawke's Bay District Health Board<br>head-on<br>um and winter 2021 we had a respiratory<br>presentation to Hospital Winter like<br>we'd never seen before<br>um and so it actually wasn't covered<br>that was putting pressure on our<br>hospital we<br>um uh we are a hospital that was built<br>for 90 000 people of Hawkes Bay and we<br>now have 180 000 people we had an<br>emergency department that was built for<br>60 people to be in it and we see 180<br>people a day<br>so the the for for us<br>um we didn't even get to think about<br>covert because there were other things<br>uh that were in front of us so I think<br>that people accepted that there was only<br>so much could be managed through the<br>pipe and we were going to have to live<br>with the consequences of that and I<br>think for everybody in this room they<br>will know that the consequences of that<br>faux completely differently across<br>different demographics of New Zealand<br>and it will be poor people and it will<br>be brown people that will be facing the<br>consequences of that for far longer than<br>the I'll just check no one in the room<br>all right well I've got a lot so we'll<br>keep going the um<br>rob you said something really<br>interesting earlier about Information<br>Management you know people that seemed<br>solid suddenly felt like they'd gone<br>down a conspiracy hole and so on<br>um at different times the covert<br>response was criticized for maybe over<br>managing information and so on what do<br>you think could have been better in that<br>space what what were the gaps what did<br>we get right and and what could have<br>been better because many sectors of the<br>world<br>talk about that as actually one of the<br>strongest parts of the New Zealand<br>response relative to how it played out<br>elsewhere<br>I think this issue falls into the<br>category of this lack of adaptation and<br>Agility I think we did really well on<br>communication early on I think<br>um<br>the Prime Minister and Ashley built real<br>trust and confidence<br>through that probably 2020 period And I<br>mean<br>evidenced by the election result right<br>you know as a population we're very<br>supportive of what the government was<br>doing the direction we were heading in<br>uh<br>I think as soon as we got into the<br>vaccine phase there are a whole bunch of<br>unexpected issues emerged you know we we<br>clearly there's a lot of criticism<br>because the uh vaccine was perceived to<br>be late arriving in New Zealand there<br>are a lot of issues<br>around the process of in the information<br>around the vaccine and so on<br>and we're under pressure to get it<br>rolled out because vaccine was seen as<br>as a critical foundation stone to being<br>able to move to a different state I<br>guess<br>and I think it's when we got into that<br>phase<br>and there started to be a few chinks in<br>the armor and there were certain certain<br>segments of the population that believe<br>that government wasn't being full and<br>Frank or the Prime Minister wasn't or<br>actually wasn't about vaccine and and<br>the consequences of it and<br>the justification for why it seemed to<br>be arriving late and so on and I think<br>it was from that stage onwards that we<br>saw trust start to give away a little<br>bit and with trust is connected to<br>social license and so on and you just<br>sort of saw a few things fraying at the<br>seams and then ultimately I think there<br>was a fatigue element that that set in<br>as well<br>when you got to August 2021 and you had<br>the the Delta outbreak in the Auckland<br>lockdown<br>I think that really started to test<br>people's<br>I I guess commitment again and Trust in<br>the government<br>uh and it all started unraveling pretty<br>quickly looking forward from there<br>so if you go back and say well what<br>would you do differently it's a it's a<br>hard question I mean you know there's<br>clearly no substitute for<br>absolute honesty and and truthfulness<br>and transparency and<br>whilst I don't think there was ever any<br>dishonesty I think you've got to be<br>really careful when you're a<br>communicator that you don't try and<br>become too clever in terms of how you<br>position<br>your arguments and and position your<br>language and I think and this is not<br>directed into any individual but I think<br>collectively<br>there's too much message management<br>rather than thinking how do we get<br>really really precise clear accurate<br>confident sound bites out that people<br>can understand<br>and I think the Spin Doctors<br>progressively got involved and and that<br>started to undermine trust it does make<br>me wonder<br>whether through a process like this you<br>need some<br>independent Authority that sits outside<br>of the decision-making that can validate<br>the kind of the the source of the truth<br>if you like that's not politicized<br>that's not involved in the core decision<br>making where they're having to justify<br>their own decisions and so on which you<br>could say is true of the Ministry of<br>Health you look at the Prime Minister<br>ultimately it has to become politicized<br>right through their political lens and I<br>wonder whether you can have an<br>independent Authority that runs<br>alongside and gives people reassurance<br>of of the messaging that is is making<br>its way through because I think this<br>issue is only going to get bigger I mean<br>you look at real time so global social<br>media I mean Tick Tock Trends die they<br>arrive and they die in the space of a<br>couple of days you know it's it's and so<br>we've never we've never experienced a<br>crisis with that level of real-time<br>social media before and certainly not an<br>extended like this pandemic I'm going to<br>put a pin in there I'm going to come<br>back to that notion of the independent<br>side because I think there are some<br>questions here about looking forward<br>preparing I'm just going to check here<br>obviously we're looking at things that<br>maybe were gaps that's appropriate<br>because we're trying to learn also what<br>went well what should we be most proud<br>of what what are the things that we need<br>to ensure that we do<br>again or build upon for the next Crisis<br>spear at a pandemic or something else<br>I was just building on sorry on what Rob<br>said I think if you look around the<br>world I think the the research is<br>starting to suggest those countries that<br>did the best<br>started with strong trust in<br>institutions<br>um and and I think we have that in New<br>Zealand we're probably in a better<br>position than other countries<br>um but I think it has been eroded<br>through what we saw in covert so I think<br>there is a real need to look at our<br>system of government system of<br>Engagement with the community and how we<br>work with Community to make sure those<br>that trust is rebuilt so some of the<br>things that Rob mentioned I think are<br>critical I'd add to that<br>how to get transparency and and trust is<br>contestability of ideas I think there<br>was a sense of<br>closed uh closed<br>that that meant that different ideas<br>were not welcome and information was not<br>open so we we several times over the<br>course of the pandemic<br>asked for access to the models that were<br>guiding decision making<br>the metrics the outcomes and in fact<br>publicly called five chairs of major New<br>Zealand companies call for tell us what<br>you're solving for yet it was not shared<br>and so I think that that lack of<br>contestability or openness to different<br>views I think does erode Trust<br>both with individual citizens but also<br>other organizations that work with<br>government so I think building<br>rebuilding trust and institutions I<br>think will be one of the most important<br>things and then Rod mentioned a few<br>other things a CDC style model you know<br>surveillance for their future I mean<br>there is no question and what we have I<br>keep saying this for years we have<br>animal biosecurity at the border and<br>have had four decades and we're one of<br>the few countries in the world that<br>already have that so we know how to do<br>this human health security at the border<br>is something we have to have and there<br>are different ways you can do it but it<br>can't be ignorant of the realities of<br>running our border<br>itself so it can't be derived in<br>Wellington and then cooked up and<br>delivered it must be built with Airlines<br>water agencies airports and others so<br>trust institutions I think and looking<br>at the ways that we manage for the<br>future pandemic through building the<br>institutions that we need for the future<br>will be important<br>I actually thought we did in our<br>references earlier I thought we did a<br>really good job of the first phase<br>you know the decisions that we made and<br>you have when you remember back then<br>there was so much we didn't know so<br>we're having to make decisions on very<br>very limited information<br>and I thought we did a really good job<br>through the first phase and it's<br>fascinating<br>um<br>you know kuriana talked about we went<br>into lockdown most of Wellington went<br>home it's amazing how well that place<br>works when there's no one there I mean<br>quite quite seriously that that's right<br>kerryana didn't feed me all these lines<br>just to say because she can't say them<br>but<br>um<br>the reality is you know when when all<br>the bureaucracy was cleared out of the<br>way and there is a very very small<br>number of people making decisions it did<br>actually work really really well and a<br>lot of what we're talking about is when<br>these large kind of bureaucratic<br>monolithic things re-establish<br>themselves and you know the Ministry of<br>Health tenfold the size that it<br>previously had been then of course<br>everything slowed down I mean and it's<br>it's it's<br>just human nature you know if you have<br>10 people in a room trying to make a<br>decision it'll take twice as long as you<br>have five people in the room it probably<br>takes four times as long actually<br>um so one one of the learnings for me is<br>to say it works so well and we're making<br>really really good decisions when we had<br>a very very limited number of people<br>involved how do you protect that as you<br>move forward and try and constrain the<br>bureaucracy from re-establishing itself<br>and slowing the whole the whole machine<br>in the early days with Rob as the rose<br>amongst the Thorns because there was Rob<br>myself Mike Bush Brendan Boyle there was<br>a small group of people in the<br>Operations Command Center who met every<br>day<br>um and I came and um it was a translator<br>um in a navigator<br>of what was going on in the in the<br>ministry and we would land<br>sensible forward movement<br>um in a way that really really made<br>sense I mean I think for me uh the<br>um the things that went well and then<br>I'm not sure if we adapted as well as we<br>could<br>um at some stage we needed to convert<br>the Sim structure the Emergency<br>Management approach response to what<br>happens when the response lasts two<br>years and and and how do you evolve that<br>because a lot of that was quite well<br>understood and well protected but as Bob<br>says as you add more layers and people<br>um you really get the you really lose I<br>suppose the ability to make decisions as<br>quickly as you can<br>um<br>uh Asia and I were talking before this<br>about the um the appointment of a public<br>sector private sector task force to<br>manage their<br>um Cyclone Gabriel<br>um response from the start I think has<br>also<br>um a lesson well learned<br>um and I think that's that's good and<br>that's a lesson that is<br>um folding into each um a region<br>um you know when I talk about Hawke's<br>Bay we've got<br>um uh four District councils we've got a<br>Regional Council we've got 14 post<br>treaty cinnamon groups we've got large<br>primary industry it's the beauty of<br>democracy and the games of thrones all<br>at the same time and so you've got to be<br>able to make sure that everybody is<br>there because these are Big tasks to<br>tackle<br>um so I think that is something we need<br>to<br>um we need to work on I think the the<br>last thing which I think was a beautiful<br>thing and again I'll use the Hawke's Bay<br>example<br>um our Maori providers in our taiphenua<br>were the lead for the whole population<br>for our care in the community<br>uh and for our vaccination program<br>um and um you know in Hawke's Bay we can<br>be a little bit Plymouth Rock<br>um and sometimes there are people who<br>would have not even have known that<br>Maori providers existed<br>um and yet everybody's experience was as<br>positive as it could be and I think it<br>was a real measure of what's good for<br>Maori is good for everybody<br>um and uh covert allowed that<br>opportunity to shine and so I think<br>that's an increased incredibly positive<br>thing that came out of our experience of<br>the tale of covert thank you and I'm<br>just got a question from the floor here<br>and we've got about six minutes or so<br>and then we'll go into close please<br>Cura Josie Pagani here great discussion<br>guys thank you um I just want to ask<br>what do you think do you have any<br>confidence that the Royal commission<br>will address any of the issues that<br>uh<br>uh that's an interesting question I'm<br>really hopeful that it does<br>um I think the Royal commission is<br>critical I mean you look<br>so much of our response was developed on<br>the fly it wasn't predetermined and<br>already you know the key leaders that<br>have all that learning in their in their<br>heads actually has gone to a different<br>role the prime minister's no longer in<br>her role<br>none of the three of us are in our roles<br>you know the world moves on really<br>really quickly so I think the Royal<br>commission is critical<br>to capture the learnings I I think the<br>chair of that commission coming from<br>offshore will be a really good<br>perspective from the outside<br>um in so I think that Independence is<br>really valuable and I think it's<br>absolutely critical we did get some<br>things uh right you know and it's the<br>nature of the session kind of is<br>designed to look for improvement<br>opportunities we got a lot right but<br>there's a lot we could do so much better<br>and I think actually next time around<br>it'll be even tougher I mean this this<br>misinformation issue I think is you know<br>one of the biggest issues facing our<br>generation is and is going to keep<br>growing<br>I'd certainly like to see the terms of<br>reference to broadened I think they are<br>too narrow and I think when you've got a<br>an event like this it affects almost all<br>parts of our country<br>Society culture economy so I think it's<br>it's too narrow so I I'd like to hope<br>maybe a new prime minister might be<br>willing to open that up a little bit<br>more<br>um I also and this is not a comment on<br>Tony Blakely but I would have preferred<br>someone a bit more distant from the New<br>Zealand response cheering it I think<br>it's a little bit too close to home you<br>know we engage with Tony in a few things<br>throughout the pandemic response from<br>our point of view and I know he was<br>involved in other things so I I think<br>distant sort of reflection on what we<br>did pick up both the good and the things<br>that we work on would be great but it is<br>what it is but a broader reference I<br>think would be great<br>I think the broader reference will<br>potentially get Force because as soon as<br>you open the lines of inquiry people<br>bring whatever it is that they want to<br>bring to the table<br>and as a former public server server and<br>all right I'm going to go to the closing<br>question this is uh the goal of learning<br>so one that's come through<br>if you were designing a pandemic<br>response agency what personnel do you<br>think it's broader and management need<br>how do we set ourselves up better for<br>the next one and we'll just go a quick<br>fire through the team<br>um I think it needs to be probably a<br>little bit more United Colors of benefit<br>which is my point about we need to be<br>making sure that we've we've got private<br>we've got public we've got people that<br>really understand responses we've got<br>we've got Maori and that we think about<br>that purposefully from the start<br>um and not make it look like it's<br>something we thought about later or were<br>pushed we're pushed to think about after<br>we went live<br>I'd simply like to apply the the<br>standard cross submitted response uh and<br>it's been touched on by both these guys<br>as well which is in the way we ran at<br>the airport I'm sure the same in New<br>Zealand which is you have your immediate<br>response team you have your recovery<br>team who look ahead to how do we get out<br>the back of this and then you have your<br>strategy team who look very long term<br>and all of those have to operate at the<br>same time and then<br>in doing so you then draw on the whole<br>of the country all the expertise all the<br>knowledge and are open and agile and how<br>you respond but I think that would yeah<br>and that's an evolution of what we did<br>do but I think that would help make the<br>next time better<br>and we write it down we must write down<br>what we learned thank you<br>there's a couple of key principles for<br>me around how you go about designing a<br>future pandemic response the first is<br>that all your best knowledge is always<br>out on the front lines right so you have<br>to figure out how you can have<br>distributed access to new insights that<br>are occurring whether that's from<br>businesses say different Community<br>groups from Maori and so on so<br>having those insights able to be<br>absorbed by the decision makers<br>absolutely key number one<br>second for me as as open-mindedness you<br>know one of the fascinating things about<br>this pandemic things that I believed<br>a month then were often proven to be no<br>longer true three months in or six<br>months in you have to be able to walk<br>away from absolute truths that you<br>believe and accept new realities as they<br>emerge it's it's really easy to get<br>trapped into a mindset of Defending a<br>previously held belief when it's no<br>longer true and I think that was really<br>evident so you need a principle of<br>open-mindedness you need a principle of<br>being able to access and Source insights<br>globally from the best practice we had<br>countries that were experiencing things<br>well ahead of us because they were<br>pursuing different strategies and we<br>weren't adapting adapting their<br>learnings and then the third piece of me<br>so as I say you need this<br>Independence<br>and to be able to build confidence and<br>what is the the truth transparency and<br>honesty as you move and so I think the<br>CDC and uh<br>in in the leadership there was a global<br>role model that we could we could learn<br>from and we could adapt here as well<br>thank you look we're at times so I'll<br>call it for this session uh there are a<br>lot of questions that came through that<br>we didn't get to that's the uh those<br>happen in the foyer some of them are<br>probably best expressed on a smaller<br>stage as well<br>um but kittiana Adrian Rob thank you so<br>much for this I know that uh covert for<br>some as you said seems a long time ago<br>but we are still living with so many of<br>the other impacts and we don't know what<br>is around the corner and some of these<br>things in fact we're right right in the<br>middle of when we brought in the<br>definition of the responses we need so<br>we all really appreciate it and we'll<br>I would uh now welcome to the stage<br>we've got one session before we move<br>into a lunch break where you can ask the<br>uh the other questions about the vaccine<br>procurement strategy uh but I will now<br>welcome to the stage Nicola Willis the<br>spokes opposition spokesperson for<br>finance and also Deputy leader of the<br>let's see it<br>good morning everyone I'm delighted to<br>be here at the New Zealand economics<br>Forum with you today<br>to discuss the challenges facing our<br>economy and to share Nationals plans for<br>reducing the cost of living and lifting<br>incomes for all<br>let me acknowledge the esteemed guests<br>in the room uh the right honorable Jim<br>Bolger former prime minister of New<br>Zealand I think here in that capacity<br>but also as a great dad to his son the<br>head of the waikato management school<br>and my former fonterra colleague Matt<br>Bulger of course Vice Chancellor<br>Professor Neil Quigley economists<br>Business Leaders experts students all of<br>you<br>I'm very impressed by the qualifications<br>the expertise and the experience<br>assembled at this forum<br>and so let me be candid I don't share<br>anything like the depth of formal<br>economics training that many in this<br>room today have<br>I first learned about small business<br>economics and global trade not from<br>textbooks but by observing the<br>efficiency of the commercial kitchen at<br>the Holy Bagel Cafe where I worked in<br>the early 2000s<br>through my successful and unsuccessful<br>adventures and upselling at the Wallace<br>rose clothing boutique and by comparing<br>stock lists sales volumes and price<br>points at the Timberland shoe shop I<br>once helped manage<br>and I learned about what economics means<br>for households through juggling our<br>first mortgage and the child care costs<br>of our four kids<br>and by being invited into the lives of<br>new zealanders from all walks of life<br>who have had the generosity to share<br>their stories and their hopes with me<br>and I learned what matters for our<br>exporters by talking with the team at a<br>factory in Colombo Turning New Zealand<br>milk into branded consumer products<br>by watching closely as my senior<br>managers negotiated deals with global<br>food producers in Shanghai<br>and by listening to Farmers while gazing<br>out over muddy paddocks right here in<br>the waikato<br>and experiences like these have left<br>their mark on me and many of my National<br>Party colleagues<br>our team holds our economic policies to<br>the Practical tests of everyday life<br>if it won't make a meaningful positive<br>difference to shop owners and workers to<br>Everyday families and exporters then we<br>won't pursue it<br>National knows that stronger and a more<br>productive economy is ultimately driven<br>Along by people taking action by people<br>choosing to put in extra effort knowing<br>they'll be rewarded for it<br>by people applying greater skill to the<br>tasks at hand so they can be done<br>quicker and with less expense<br>by people innovating better ways to do<br>things dreaming up and delivering new<br>ideas new products new Services by<br>people making better use of the<br>resources geography and history has<br>granted us and by people selling more to<br>the world beyond our Shores<br>and as we meet here today there are many<br>practical challenges standing in the way<br>of that effort and that innovation<br>the destruction and Devastation caused<br>by Cyclone Gabriel in North Island<br>flooding are immense<br>and I want to share your recognition I'm<br>sure of the people so badly affected<br>today<br>we owe those affected a swift recovery<br>and rebuild<br>and we owe all new zealanders the<br>assurance that we will apply the lessons<br>learned<br>at the same time the cost of living is<br>higher than it's ever been inflation has<br>now been out of the Reserve Bank target<br>range for 21 months and it isn't<br>forecast to come back down to Target for<br>another year<br>with the thief of inflation comes Rising<br>interest rates not in the effect not in<br>the history of the official cash rate<br>have new zealanders experienced such a<br>fast and Dramatic Lift in interest rates<br>such as occurred since October 2021<br>the result is that many homeowners will<br>be left scrambling this year when their<br>mortgages come up for refixing and they<br>switch from a rate with a two or a three<br>in front of it to something with a six<br>in front of it so many new zealanders<br>that difference is worth hundreds of<br>dollars a fortnight<br>the average hourly wage may be nominally<br>higher but for many people it hasn't<br>kept up with Rising prices meaning each<br>fortnight's pay gets stretched thinner<br>than the last<br>worker shortages are persisting and<br>slowing activity down from the wait for<br>your coffee to the building of New Roads<br>to the filing and filling of exporters<br>order books<br>inflation and fiscal drag have pushed<br>New Zealand workers into higher tax<br>brackets meaning typical income earners<br>are paying more tax<br>government spending has leapt up to 35<br>percent of GDP higher than it's been in<br>17 years yet look around and it's<br>difficult to find solid evidence that<br>the performance of key Frontline Public<br>Services be they hospitals or schools<br>has actually improved<br>so as we plan for the future New Zealand<br>must simultaneously fix these problems<br>and rise to Growing Global challenges<br>decarbonizing our economy<br>adapting to the more frequent severe<br>weather events that climate change is<br>bringing<br>and maintaining a secure footing in a<br>world of less stable Foreign Affairs of<br>de-globalization and growing<br>protectionism<br>so how will we do it today I want to<br>take this opportunity to set out<br>Nationals plans for fighting inflation<br>growing our economy and building<br>resilience for the future<br>we see the growing cost of living is the<br>number one economic issue for New<br>Zealand people are really hurting across<br>all walks of life<br>debt areas are up queues for food banks<br>are longer anxiety about household<br>finances is rising<br>National maintains the Orthodox view<br>that the independent Reserve Bank must<br>play a leading role in this fight<br>we will return the bank to a single<br>Mandate of delivering price stability<br>with a one to three percent inflation<br>Target band<br>we will also commission an independent<br>review of the bank's performance over<br>the period 2020 to 2022 when<br>extraordinary monetary policy decisions<br>were taken including a volume of<br>quantitative easing that proportionate<br>to the size of our economy put us<br>amongst the top handful of covert money<br>printers in the world<br>second<br>National well unblock major supply side<br>constraints to proactive growth<br>starting by addressing worker shortages<br>we will cut through the holdups and the<br>immigration system so that businesses<br>and hospitals by the way can get the<br>workers that they need<br>if you want to think of the human face<br>of what our immigration policies have<br>meant in recent times let me tell you<br>the story of the nurse who came running<br>up to my car and knocked on the window<br>as I waited to pick my girls up from<br>their dance class recently<br>once she'd got over the fact that I<br>don't look as good as the nice picture<br>of me on the car uh when I don't have my<br>makeup on on a Saturday morning and she<br>realized it was in fact me she said<br>Nikola Nicola I just want to let you<br>know I'll be voting for National for the<br>first time ever and I said well why is<br>that she said I'm a nurse<br>and we need to bring more nurses into<br>the country and you're the only ones<br>who've stood up for the green list<br>process and I said well yeah it must be<br>so hard for you having to work all those<br>extra shifts she said nope that's not it<br>I I happily do that because I started<br>nursing because I want to care for<br>people the problem is too many nights I<br>spend in tears thinking of the patients<br>who didn't get the care they deserved<br>because there's not enough of us on the<br>ward<br>third we will stop the tidal wave of new<br>costs and regulations that have added<br>more price pressure to everything from<br>food to rent<br>case in point changing the tax treatment<br>of rental properties<br>officials warned that a beehive proposal<br>to check change the tax treatment of<br>rental properties could increase rents<br>and churn for renters that is exactly<br>what has happened<br>National will back tenants and reduce<br>pressure on rents by restoring interest<br>deductibility for rental properties and<br>taking the brightline test back to two<br>years<br>while we're at it we'll also remove the<br>Ute tax the Auckland Regional fuel tax<br>and the proposed app tax that increase<br>the prices people pay for vehicles<br>petrol and soon their Airbnb and Uber<br>Eats too<br>fourth<br>National well-restored discipline to<br>government spending<br>this will help ease the pressure on<br>inflation in interest rates that has<br>been exacerbated by loose fiscal policy<br>it will increase the focus on results<br>for money spent and it will allow our<br>government to reduce the tax burden on<br>new zealanders<br>I want to spend some time on this point<br>of disciplined spending because it is<br>very important<br>government spending is up a billion<br>dollars a week since labor took office<br>in 2017.<br>in the last Financial year government<br>spend encrypt up to 35 percent of our<br>economic output a higher level than<br>we've seen in at least 17 years<br>worse new zealanders simply aren't being<br>delivered value for the Dollar's text<br>and spent<br>from elective surgery to emergency care<br>to social housing waiting lists are<br>bigger and waiting times are longer<br>whether it's the stalled Auckland Light<br>Rail Project the excruciatingly slow<br>Dunedin Hospital build<br>or the 100 in 76 supposedly shovel ready<br>projects began with covert mini yet<br>still not completed<br>infrastructure is not getting built in a<br>timely way<br>and the Minister of Finance chose 2022 a<br>year when inflation ran at a 30-year<br>high as the time to introduce the<br>biggest spending budget in New Zealand<br>history<br>National sees plenty of evidence that<br>this large yes has enabled an<br>ill-disciplined approach to government<br>spending here's a few examples I think<br>of<br>the huge growth and the core Public<br>Service it's not the front line workers<br>the teachers and the nurses but those<br>are in the back room roles with ten<br>thousand plus additional public servants<br>being hired into non-frontline roles<br>such as policy advice HR and<br>Communications<br>even while at the same time consultancy<br>fees and I'm sure there's some wonderful<br>people from Deloitte and PWC and such<br>yet a day<br>but those fees have leapt to around<br>1.7 billion dollars a year<br>Millions upon Millions have been spent<br>on projects such as the tvnzr NZ merger<br>the failed tipukina reforms and the<br>social insurance scheme proposal<br>only for some of those projects to be<br>put on ice as the political temperature<br>has heated up<br>I think of the decision to forge ahead<br>with a 30 billion dollar Auckland Light<br>Rail Project even while hundreds of<br>kilometers of uh Regional roads need<br>urgent repairs and as Helen Clark so<br>rightly pointed out on Twitter recently<br>even while we know that the thing would<br>that would best enable lower carbon<br>transport are for many aucklanders is in<br>fact a more reliable and frequent bus<br>service<br>think of the willingness to fund<br>hundreds of millions of dollars and<br>frankly corporate welfare for large<br>firms using funds raised by the<br>emissions trading scheme and ultimately<br>paid for by everyday taxpayers<br>so National's commitment is to deliver<br>more value for government spending by<br>prioritizing beta seizing clear Public<br>Service targets and holding government<br>agencies accountable for their results<br>well we're at it we'll cut through the<br>complexity of government Social Services<br>provision with a social investment<br>approach that will drive more<br>responsibility to the community<br>organizations whose work has just been<br>applauded by that panel on stage this<br>morning<br>finally our part of National's approach<br>to the cost of living is to reduce the<br>rising tax burden that has made it<br>harder for new zealanders to keep up<br>with Rising prices<br>tax revenue has jumped an eye watering<br>43 billion dollars a year over the past<br>five years helped Along by rampant<br>inflation it's handmaiden fiscal drag<br>and a clutch of new taxes<br>that extra tax take and I know you<br>mostly numbers people in this room but<br>43 billion dollars doesn't make much<br>sense to the average person but that<br>extra take tax tag is equivalent to 17<br>500 per household<br>and despite the claims of prime minister<br>Hipkins core Crown tax revenue is now a<br>higher proportion of the economy than it<br>has been for many years exceeding 30<br>percent of GDP in the last Financial<br>year a level not reached since labor was<br>last in office<br>in the past few years as I say rampant<br>inflation has acted as a secret tax hike<br>on every New Zealander paying income tax<br>with higher nominal incomes pushing<br>even while their purchasing power has<br>dragged behind so last year our national<br>party leader Chris luxon put out a fully<br>costed specific proposal to adjust tax<br>brackets<br>the changes he proposed would increase<br>the income level at which the 17.5<br>percent 30 percent and 33 tax rates<br>would kick in<br>the proposed changes will deliver<br>someone in the median wage on the medium<br>wage of fifty five thousand dollars a<br>year eight hundred dollars a year in tax<br>relief someone on the average wage would<br>be better off by 870 a year while anyone<br>earning seventy eight thousand dollars<br>or more would benefit from around uh<br>well from exactly one thousand and forty<br>three dollars a year<br>superannuitants would also benefit super<br>is indexed to the average after tax wage<br>and because our tax changes will<br>increase average after tax wages super<br>payments for a couple would increase by<br>around 500 a 540 a year<br>now National can afford these tax<br>commitments<br>cause of our commitment to disciplined<br>government spending<br>and we do hope to deliver more tax<br>reduction Beyond this but only if fiscal<br>and economic conditions permit<br>our fiscal strategy will balance the<br>need to invest in resilient<br>future-proofed infrastructure and to<br>chart a path back to Surplus and debt<br>reduction<br>it is possible to do this without adding<br>new taxes<br>think of the example of John key in Bill<br>English and the work they did to get New<br>Zealand's books back in order after the<br>GFC and the Canterbury quakes<br>their government rightly increased<br>borrowing to support people through the<br>hard times ensuring a strong social<br>safety net for people who lost their<br>jobs when the global economy tanked<br>increasing funding for health and<br>education even while tax revenues fell<br>and investing carefully in the<br>Canterbury rebuild<br>if National is elected to lead the<br>government this year we will honor our<br>party's Legacy of strong economic<br>management<br>ultimately I believe<br>that the best way to increase<br>Investments on the front line Public<br>Services New zealanders need and deserve<br>is to provide resilience and to provide<br>growth productive sustainable low<br>inflation growth doesn't just happen<br>it isn't created by government task<br>forces and committees no matter how well<br>intentioned they are<br>instead government policy must create<br>the conditions that will maximize the<br>contribution each individual New<br>Zealander can make and will choose to<br>make<br>so Nationals prescription for stronger<br>economic growth can be summer summarized<br>in five key areas<br>number one<br>it starts with education<br>education is the greatest equalizer the<br>state can bestow the most reliable<br>ticket to a better future and a strong<br>predictor of the quality of life a child<br>will have access to<br>and in a world of challenging<br>demographics of Greater automation of AI<br>and competitive Global labor markets New<br>Zealand simply must do better at<br>ensuring our own citizens have the<br>greatest skills and knowledge needed to<br>do the jobs of today and tomorrow<br>and it should be of grave concern to<br>everyone in this room<br>that by many measures New Zealand school<br>students today are less numerate<br>and less literate than they once were<br>and that's not only relative to students<br>from many of the countries we like to<br>compare ourselves with but even more<br>worryingly that's compared to New<br>Zealand students of past decades<br>rather than doing better for the next<br>Generation we are doing worse<br>that is a moral failure it is a social<br>failure and it is a future economic<br>disaster<br>so National will get back to basics in<br>our schools we will sit and report on<br>clear achievement expectations and we<br>will cut the bureaucracy to put<br>employers back at the center of Applied<br>training<br>second we will deliver the<br>infrastructure that New Zealand needs to<br>support future growth resilience and<br>zero carbon connectivity<br>that means working much more effectively<br>with the private sector viewing them as<br>our friends not our enemies<br>offering more flexibility in the way<br>that we Finance big projects and<br>sequencing those projects with greater<br>coordination and foresight<br>crucially it means getting our<br>consenting regime right we are concerned<br>that the government's proposed Resource<br>Management act Replacements May in fact<br>be worse than the status quo with one<br>submitter confirming the changes would<br>make it harder not easier to consent<br>wind farms that cannot stand<br>third we will Turbo Charge The<br>Innovation engine backing firms to<br>embrace productivity enhancing<br>technology<br>easing access to global Capital that<br>will allow new Ventures to expand and<br>flourish and remaining open to the<br>talent and skills immigrants can bring<br>fourth we will stop the tidal wave of<br>mostly well-meaning But ultimately<br>destructive regulation that has come to<br>smother too many business owners from<br>the triple CFA which has strangled<br>access to credit but particularly for<br>low-income and low wealth individuals<br>to the so-called Fair pay legislation<br>which is set to tie hundreds of<br>otherwise productive people down in<br>negotiating rooms even when many of the<br>employees don't want to be part of it<br>to the prescriptive farming regulations<br>that defy practicality and ignore<br>Regional reality<br>sometimes I'm asked how can you quantify<br>New Zealand's growing regulatory burden<br>what's your proof point<br>and they're hard to find but perhaps the<br>best measure is the hours that small<br>business owners tell me they now spend<br>at their kitchen table with the lamp on<br>responding to the latest compliance<br>email from a government Department<br>those hours at night spent on compliance<br>are not spent working on the business<br>they are hours not spent nabbing a new<br>customer hours not spent with family<br>those are the hours that the national<br>government will work hard to give back<br>finally National will keep strengthening<br>our connections to the World building on<br>existing trading Partnerships and easing<br>the door open to new ones<br>our viewers that New Zealand must<br>diversify the places we sell to and<br>extract more value for the selling that<br>we do and New Zealand must not be Inward<br>and insular we must be outward looking<br>and globally minded and that means<br>continually seeking to compete with the<br>rest of the world<br>by that measure we are currently<br>slipping last year New Zealand suffered<br>the biggest drop in rankings among 63<br>countries compared on measures of their<br>competitiveness including technology<br>science and business productivity<br>I see that as a warning Bell and if<br>policy makers don't react then we are<br>accepting a slide backwards for our<br>country and its people<br>let me close the speech by saying what<br>makes me fundamentally optimistic about<br>New Zealand's prospects<br>that's because the strengths that we<br>have as an economy are almost exactly<br>the strengths countries will need to<br>succeed in the changing world of coming<br>decades<br>in a world of growing food and security<br>we already feed 40 million people and we<br>have huge opportunities to get more<br>value for the sustainable carbon<br>efficient nutritious food we produce<br>and a world Desperately Seeking to<br>transition away from fossil fuels and<br>towards renewable energy we already<br>depend on largely renewable electricity<br>and with the right approach to<br>consenting we have the ability to<br>produce much more abundant renewable<br>energy we have the resources to<br>Electrify New Zealand<br>and in a world increasingly nervous<br>about conflict and Border disputes we<br>remain an independent nation committed<br>to the rules-based international order<br>and quite simply our country has the<br>best people in the world hard-working<br>community-minded Innovative<br>entrepreneurial<br>new zealanders are our economies magic<br>ingredient<br>so Nationals economic management<br>approach and closing will back all those<br>kiwis working hard all those people<br>doing double shifts early mornings late<br>nights and weekends<br>we will back the new zealanders fueled<br>by our shared determination to provide<br>for their families and do well by their<br>kids and we will stand with all the new<br>zealanders who want to get ahead under<br>their own steam people are at the heart<br>of Nationals policies and I know that<br>they will be at the heart of the<br>discussions here today<br>as the university says I wish you well<br>for the Forum I thank you again for this<br>audience and I look forward to your<br>questions<br>all right good and Nicola thank you so<br>as before there are roaming mics if<br>you'd like to ask a question please just<br>raise a hand one of the team will bring<br>a microphone to you and I've got some<br>here I see one question here and then<br>I'll go to the slido so we can get a<br>Gilda Nicola Peter rice from clearpoint<br>advisors I'm actually a London firm<br>possibly that's why we have a little<br>more red tape these days I think there's<br>probably too many British advisors<br>coming over from previous governments<br>um Nicola look I I liked what you were<br>saying but I'd really like to hear more<br>about an industrial strategy about r d<br>all these sorts of things and we've I<br>did a report with a group of others five<br>six years ago New Zealand was in well<br>into relative decline already<br>how are you actually going to reverse<br>that because that I think is our biggest<br>issue and maybe an example is that and I<br>live in a farming community so I love my<br>Farmer neighbors but you know you look<br>at the export revenues coming out of<br>tech and services and maybe we don't<br>have to feed 40 million people maybe we<br>can just work on selling services which<br>are much friendlier to our environment<br>and we can still enjoy<br>right they came here because they wanted<br>something better and I agree it's much<br>better here<br>um<br>Kara's<br>I'm I'm a wellingtonian<br>sometimes as a<br>dude but I'm really proud that our city<br>uh is the home to zero uh to trade me to<br>multiple software as a service firms<br>that have shown that we can export<br>world-leading technology and Innovation<br>and create jobs and incomes out of it<br>equally When I visit our Farms<br>the most successful and productive<br>farmers are applying world-class<br>Innovation research and Technology you<br>know the reason zesbury's exports are in<br>such demand is because we've had the<br>best plant breeding program and we're<br>offering Innovative fruit to the world<br>so long may that continue<br>when it comes to our Innovation and<br>research and Technology policies we've<br>set a woman known for her feisty nurse<br>and tenacity onto the task one Judith<br>Collins and look she has been hugely<br>energized by going and talking to those<br>involved in the tech world and if I were<br>to summarize the thoughts that she's<br>bringing to us that will inform the<br>policy will announce uh shortly in fact<br>we we know that there can be a lot of<br>discussion about the government science<br>system and The Innovation architecture<br>that's a top-down approach we need to<br>instead have a bottom-up approach that<br>says what will enable that small<br>employer that farmer that small exporter<br>to take up the technology that will make<br>them more productive how do we ensure<br>they are able to make those Capital<br>Investments able to access the capital<br>have access to an innovation system<br>that's actually delivering to their real<br>needs we see a lot of potential to do<br>better so I look forward to discussing<br>it more with you<br>you got to thank you and I'll go to the<br>screen now but please keep any other<br>questions coming so we're just a few<br>weeks out we're fresh in the recovery<br>from extreme weather events uh<br>how would a national-led government make<br>New Zealand more resilient to more<br>extreme weather events and what role do<br>you see or does the party see for<br>central government in discussions of<br>managed retreat<br>thank you for the question because I<br>think these are issues that are top of<br>Mind across the country today<br>and as we look at the terrible of events<br>that have unfolded in Auckland and<br>Gisborne and Northland and Hawkes Bay<br>and elsewhere coromandel I think there's<br>a few elements the first is we do I<br>think need to take another look at our<br>emergency response mechanisms<br>of course we're still focused on that<br>response but there is going to need to<br>be a review of where things weren't<br>ready whether that's the river<br>monitoring whether that's flood warnings<br>whether that's a communication systems<br>and how they operate when there's no<br>electricity all of that needs to be<br>re-evaluated and we need to do a better<br>job there the second bit is about where<br>we build and what infrastructure we have<br>connecting our communities and our<br>people<br>a national looks at that in two ways the<br>First on that question of where we build<br>where we exclude from building due to<br>Natural Hazard risk or where we<br>discourage building because of natural<br>Hazard risks we realize there's one of<br>those very nutty problems where you have<br>both the potential moral hazard of<br>stepping in where insurers already have<br>a critical role you also have potential<br>issues of fairness and that any decision<br>made in one locality must be widely<br>applicable across the country<br>and it's because of that nuttiness and<br>the need for these to be uh<br>decisions that cross multiple<br>governments that we have supported Todd<br>Muller to engage in discussions uh with<br>James Shaw our climate change<br>spokesperson with the climate change<br>minister to look at those questions of<br>managed retreat but the second part is<br>how do we deliver infrastructure because<br>I put to you the discussion about<br>climate change adaptation and resilience<br>should not be one about who has the<br>bigger checkbook because checkbooks<br>aren't actually the barrier it's about<br>who's got the plan to deliver it and<br>it's our view that New Zealand needs to<br>be much smarter about both prioritizing<br>our infrastructure Investments<br>committing to a long-term timeline and<br>sequencing at those building projects so<br>that firms workers experts want to come<br>and commit themselves to being part of<br>our long-term infrastructure pipeline so<br>our infrastructure spokesperson Chris<br>Christians just come in related to cost<br>of living so did you not consider a tax<br>threshold or perhaps removing GST on<br>food is better to help with the cost of<br>living crisis given median income here<br>is fifty five thousand dollars<br>uh look um I can't go to a public<br>meeting in New Zealand without<br>considering that question uh because<br>it's certainly something that occurs to<br>people because the most obvious cost of<br>living crunch is when you go to the<br>supermarket and you look at the price of<br>broccoli or cabbage and<br>um I'll really admit it's eye watering<br>and really difficult for many families<br>the challenge with doing a GST change of<br>that sort is twofold first there's no<br>guarantee that all of the GST reduction<br>will be passed on to the Shopper or the<br>consumer so there is a real risk there<br>the second issue of course is that in a<br>sense it's quite a regressive way of<br>addressing tax and that those who buy<br>more vegetables at the high Market<br>um you know more Wilsons and the like<br>are going to end up getting more tax<br>reduction than lower income people and<br>finally the tax purists here will<br>understand that New Zealand's commitment<br>to a broad-based GST system with the<br>minimum of exclusions technicality and<br>complexity has served us quite well as<br>the Australians with their books full of<br>whether it's a cooked chicken or an<br>uncooked chicken and what the tax<br>treatment should be would attest so we<br>are very conscious uh that food is a<br>massive cost of living pressure and<br>that's one of the reasons why Todd<br>Muller our agricultural spokesperson is<br>on a mission to identify those<br>regulations that have added to the cost<br>burden on our farmers in recent years<br>such that those costs are being passed<br>on to New Zealand shoppers<br>thank you and<br>um<br>referencing another area of costs there<br>are a couple of questions I'll put<br>together here so one is that you focused<br>on fiscal discipline in your speech but<br>didn't reference Cyclone recovery how<br>would National think about funding that<br>but there's also a question around water<br>infrastructure very topical<br>we hear rates won't increase but<br>there'll be use of debt how would that<br>be funded and of course those two things<br>might be the same<br>well I may have spoken too fast I<br>certainly did reference Cyclone recovery<br>we see that as a critical part of both<br>the immediate spending priorities for<br>New Zealand but also the medium-term<br>infrastructure building that's going to<br>have to go on we see Cyclone recovery as<br>being both the immediate response to get<br>communities and families back on their<br>feet but also about restoring those<br>connections whether it's the 15 bridges<br>that are down whether it's making sure<br>that telecommunications are more<br>resilient in the future so as I set out<br>our viewers that if we are being<br>disciplined about our books elsewhere<br>then there is a case for borrowing for<br>those long-term Investments so long as<br>we pl chart a path back to Surplus<br>certainly that is the approach that key<br>in English took after the Canterbury<br>Quakes and I think what they<br>demonstrated was it is possible to be<br>very careful about those rebuild<br>Investments while also chatting a path<br>back to Surplus second question is about<br>water infrastructure and some of you<br>will have seen that we have announced<br>our alternative approach to the<br>government's proposed three Waters<br>reforms<br>our approach acknowledges uh that New<br>Zealand is underdone on our water<br>infrastructure investment that we need<br>to do much better in the future we see<br>the way forward not as taking control<br>and ownership away from local<br>communities who don't wish to give that<br>control and ownership away and not to be<br>creating new centralized Mega<br>bureaucracies with complex co-governance<br>structures around them<br>but instead to say we want from<br>henceforth have a water regulator in<br>fact we accept the government's model<br>there that will set quality standards we<br>will also have an economic regulator<br>that will require councils to<br>demonstrate they have a 30-year plan for<br>investing in their water infrastructure<br>in that they have a finance plan for<br>raising the revenue to support those<br>Investments<br>we've put forward a structure which<br>would allow councils to more readily<br>work together to put those plans<br>together with regional controlled<br>organizations in which no council has<br>more than 50 percent share it will be<br>much more possible for councils to<br>access the long-term funding and finance<br>that they have lacked access to in the<br>past and that has stopped many of them<br>from making these longer-term<br>Investments<br>thank you question Adrian Nicola thank<br>you for those comments I wondered if I<br>could just broaden out a little bit and<br>pick up on your last comment about<br>30-year view because I think if we if we<br>look around the world there's a strong<br>sense that demography is Destiny for<br>many countries and superpowers of many<br>countries around the world as being a<br>place where skilled migrants want to<br>come and work if I then pick up on your<br>themes around the need to invest in<br>these critical bits of infrastructure<br>which I totally agree with how do we<br>start to have a a more open discussion<br>about what is our strategy for New<br>Zealand for a population point of view<br>how do we get the right people here and<br>how big do we want to be in the future I<br>note that in Australia it's quite an<br>open discussion between political<br>parties left and right<br>but it seems to be the unspoken topic<br>here but if we were able to have that<br>conversation about the right kind of<br>migrants that we wanted on a year by<br>year basis business could start to build<br>up the scale could respond on an annual<br>basis we could get the houses built in<br>the right way and then we could have the<br>infrastructure we truly want in a<br>country that's long and thin in the<br>future so could you just talk a little<br>bit more about a longer term view on<br>immigration and how that's important for<br>this<br>yeah<br>um thanks for the question because I<br>agree demography is one of the major<br>challenges for New Zealand many<br>countries around the world over the<br>coming decades<br>and when I think about that issue it's<br>just abundantly clear to me that we are<br>going to have to<br>include in our plans welcoming people<br>with the skills and talent we need from<br>other countries uh in the world<br>and I think it's a great shame that in<br>these past couple of years while other<br>countries such as Canada or in Australia<br>and others have been rolling out the<br>welcome mat to Skilled foreigners New<br>Zealand has been putting up the stop<br>sign<br>and that seems a very bad message<br>in our view is that it's going to get<br>harder not easier to attract skilled<br>workers in the future<br>so the conversation we want to have is<br>this isn't in either or it's not train<br>and educate your own people or import<br>from overseas it has to be both<br>because when we allow more skilled<br>workers to fill the gaps in our own<br>businesses and public services we're<br>then able to better educate our own<br>people and provide them more<br>opportunities so the discussion we would<br>like to have is about what New Zealand<br>needs to have the industries the growth<br>and the services that new zealanders<br>expect and the conversation we would<br>like to have is one that stops these<br>tropes that immigrants are somehow<br>taking from us<br>when actually all of the evidence and<br>research says they give to us and I want<br>to thank business New Zealand for their<br>work which has highlighted these<br>demographic issues and their recent<br>publication and I want to say just for<br>the record that I think immigrants are<br>important not only in an economic sense<br>but I believe that successive waves of<br>immigration have enriched our society<br>our communities and who we are as a<br>country<br>thank you I will do my brief plug for<br>welcoming International students back<br>into the country it's brilliant to have<br>them here and on that it'll be our last<br>question but I'm going to stay on<br>education you started<br>your discussion on plans for growth with<br>education<br>this is a university if you walk out<br>over lunch you'll see a lot of bright<br>young people with amazing Futures in<br>front of them you've touched on some of<br>those points but what would we expect to<br>see<br>is the outcomes after uh take a period<br>take three years what outcomes do you<br>want to see change and how would<br>National achieve those outcomes in<br>education<br>look this is an area I'm passionate<br>about and Chris luxon and I spend lots<br>of hours talking about because he's very<br>passionate about it too you know the the<br>first time I interviewed for a job uh<br>with the national party I was asked<br>which portfolio are you interested in<br>researching I said education because if<br>the state gets education right that is<br>the tool that will allow us to liberate<br>people from circumstances of<br>disadvantage so there's actually a great<br>Duty for the state to ensure that when<br>it is providing public education that is<br>doing a good job of it<br>and so the outcome that I see<br>is that we will actually address this<br>growing gap between students who go to<br>schools of lower socioeconomic<br>communities and students who go to<br>schools and higher socioeconomic<br>opportunity communities because if you<br>look at the stats today<br>actually it's middle class and upper<br>class kids who are hoovering up<br>interest-free student loans because<br>they're the ones who have the<br>qualifications to enter tertiary<br>institutions<br>we're still doing a huge disservice to<br>many children who don't leave school<br>with the Reading Writing or math skills<br>needed to even access the most basic<br>apprenticeship<br>so I would measure our performance on<br>education by how many more children are<br>achieving Reading Writing and math<br>skills that allow them to participate in<br>the modern world and are we closing the<br>Gap so that we can truly say that the<br>State education system is providing for<br>people no matter their background<br>thank you all right we will close it<br>there and move on into lunch so first<br>why don't we just have a round of<br>all right thank you very much all it's a<br>windowless room and so it's time for a<br>break uh it's about quarter past 12 food<br>is out in the foyer as I say feel free<br>to take a a stroll across campus and try<br>to recruit some students and we'll be<br>back in the room here in about five<br>minutes to 12 to 1 to start again our<br>in a world full of noise there is a<br>quiet hum<br>the hum of people looking at the big<br>of waikato we're proud of our<br>researchers tackling the big stuff head<br>on together because together we are<br>Mighty and our Mahi goes far together we<br>can see possibility in a world that is<br>gasping grasping and demanding Action<br>Now together we can find calm in the<br>chaos to recalibrate and challenge<br>everything we thought we knew to dig<br>deep and find solutions that will stick<br>to help us build a fairer world a<br>cleaner planet and keep us tracking<br>towards the goals that really matter<br>with an open mind to New Perspectives so<br>here's to the big thinkers and their<br>Brave quiet work building a Tomorrow<br>full of Hope<br>thank you<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>and I know<br>all the feelings<br>final times<br>thank you<br>sometimes<br>yeah<br>sometimes we're not ourselves<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>thank you<br>thank you<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>laughs<br>foreign<br>check<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>and see a couple of uh I can see a<br>couple of people enjoying conversations<br>still out the back that's wonderful it's<br>I just said to somebody during the break<br>that it's so good to be back here in<br>person after having to do this remotely<br>last year all right I will only be here<br>for a moment our next session is on<br>immigration it's really been touched on<br>a couple of times this morning so I will<br>introduce Anna Strutt and as a professor<br>of Economics within tarot Papa the<br>waikato management school and an<br>international Authority around trade and<br>particularly trade modeling and does a<br>lot of work with International<br>organizations so Anna I will leave it to<br>you<br>thanks very much Matt and it is indeed<br>nice to be back here in person last year<br>was quite lonely sitting on the stage<br>with distant cameras in front of us so<br>great to have everyone back with us well<br>you know as me as Matt mentioned we've<br>already been talking about immigration<br>or had it covered a little this morning<br>and I think that focusing on issues that<br>may pose particular constraints on the<br>economy is really crucial to this 2023<br>uh discussion of sustainable growth<br>productivity and well-being while we're<br>navigating these Heavy Seas so I think<br>the session is really crucial to what<br>we're talking about in this forum and we<br>are turning now of course to immigration<br>the state of the labor market and we'll<br>be considering whether this might be the<br>greatest handbrake to New Zealand and<br>the New Zealand economy at the moment<br>our three speakers that we have with us<br>today we've got uh speaking first will<br>be John mccaskill Smith John is the<br>chief Network officer of tend Health<br>Limited<br>our second speaker will be Rachel<br>Simpson Rachel is the manager for<br>Education skills<br>at business New Zealand thanks Rachel<br>and the third speaker is my colleague<br>professor John Gibson he's in the<br>economics Department here with me at<br>waikato management School<br>so I'd like to<br>um hand straight over to our first<br>speaker<br>John<br>thank you<br>um yeah my name is John mccaskill Smith<br>I'm I'm kind of here as the result of<br>the apology that was made before about<br>someone not being able to be here so I<br>apologize uh in advance I'm not an<br>immigration uh expert I'm I'm from the<br>health sector so there'll be a little<br>bit of a carry-on from I guess the<br>session<br>um this morning around some of the the<br>struggles around the impact of<br>immigration on the health sector from my<br>kind of perspective but there was just a<br>couple of comments that I really wanted<br>to kind of touch on I think um and and I<br>guess continuing on from some of the<br>themes that came out of the session this<br>morning as well<br>I think that the health sector is<br>complex like um any any industry that we<br>have operating<br>but um it's confused because it's often<br>seen as the public health sector and so<br>therefore there's a sense that it needs<br>to be run by Wellington and run by the<br>government but in actual fact um all of<br>us live at home uh and our home can mean<br>different things for different people<br>but 99.9 of the time we look after<br>ourselves and that's really what the<br>health sector is<br>when we do need care the bulk of care<br>actually takes place in the community so<br>it's outside of the infrastructure<br>that's owned by the government and<br>really off the balance sheet in terms of<br>infrastructure so that's general<br>practice it's primary care it's<br>Community Care it's ewe providers uh<br>it's NGO kind of sector so not not<br>government-owned government funded and<br>often linked to policy but that's where<br>the bulk of care takes place and then at<br>the kind of very Downstream point is the<br>hospital system where<br>um we can see the pressures that are on<br>that now and I I'd really like to put up<br>the the proposition that a lot of<br>pressure we're seeing on the hospital<br>system is a result of you know the poor<br>immigration and uh poor thinking about<br>um the Upstream infrastructure that<br>really looks after most of us in terms<br>of our our health<br>now we did a piece of work back in 2006<br>with the University of waikato where we<br>um we pulled the demographics in so we<br>looked at you know uh the organization I<br>was working for then we had about half a<br>million new zealanders enrolled with us<br>um across what was then five dhb uh dhbs<br>across the middle part of the north<br>island and um we aged that population we<br>took the disease burden and we aged that<br>and then we put it up against our supply<br>side which was actually our ability to<br>provide care in the community<br>now this is this is 2006 and we forecast<br>then that by 2027 would be 1.5 million<br>now at the time we were providing about<br>a million GP consults a year uh in the<br>same kind of sector so the sense that we<br>had to double the size of our capacity<br>our supply to meet the coming need that<br>was kind of coming through so that was<br>pretty clear and we worked quite closely<br>with<br>um the end of the labor government<br>moving into the key government then<br>around the modeling around there and to<br>try and get the investment but I guess<br>it just stopped there and like the other<br>thing that's occurred over the same kind<br>of period of time is that the workforce<br>demographics have changed significantly<br>so back then we relied heavily 66<br>percent of the GPS in the Midland kind<br>of area their base medical degree was<br>offshore so we were really really<br>heavily reliant on a Workforce that was<br>not from New Zealand and that's actually<br>got worse not better the other thing<br>that we've seen that's changed is back<br>then 88 of the GPS and this cohort uh<br>had some stake in the game so they were<br>owner operators or they owned a part of<br>the business they operated in now by<br>2018 that had completely flipped we'd<br>moved to only 26 percent of the<br>workforce had any ownership stake so the<br>bulk of the workforce had moved to<br>either contracted sessional workers or<br>salaried workers<br>there'd also been a major gender shift<br>in the primary community so we saw a<br>flip as well to heavily uh feminized<br>Workforce and we moved from one ft<br>doctor being roughly one doctor to 150<br>doctor requiring 2.7 doctors to make up<br>that FTE because people were choosing<br>not to work in the same way that they<br>were before now the consequence of all<br>these things kind combined together Dr<br>Janet Skeets who was working with us at<br>the time you know she described it as<br>the perfect storm so aging Baby Boomers<br>entering into retirement with longer<br>term more complex care that you know<br>requires more to happen Hospital systems<br>that were not kind of being resized and<br>refocused um the balance sheet and<br>health really being dhbs and hospitals<br>so the Crown's kind of focus was always<br>on the struggle in the hospitals there'd<br>been a capping of funding into the<br>primary and Community sector uh through<br>a capitation kind of model which you<br>know essentially resulted in we'll leave<br>that alone we don't need to worry about<br>it and the health system just kind of<br>missed the whole point of what was going<br>on with that perfect storm so the the<br>point you come back to the immigration<br>point is we simply we're not training<br>enough uh in the health sector to meet<br>your your needs as you age and I look<br>around and I think you know the<br>demographics and here are you're sliding<br>into that age category where you're<br>going to need more and more Health<br>Services<br>I say that respectfully<br>um but the reality is<br>um they're not going to be there or<br>you're going to have long Waits and also<br>to highlight that fact that we've got a<br>health system outside and inside of the<br>hospitals that relies heavily on foreign<br>trained doctors and nurses and others<br>I'm using sort of doctors as a proxy for<br>this and I think this the strategy and I<br>was just talking with my colleague here<br>it's um unfathomable from the houses we<br>have no idea what the government's<br>trying to do with immigration um we also<br>run immigration uh medical services and<br>we can't even forecast the volumes that<br>will begin coming through not just for<br>the health sector but for anybody else<br>it's like we're running blind so this<br>perfect storm is going to affect every<br>single one of you because you're all<br>going to need health services as you age<br>and the health services are going to be<br>harder and harder to find so<br>um I've got lots lots and lots of<br>questions about the immigration point<br>and I've got lots of other kind of<br>examples but that's just a bit of an<br>Rachel can we pass along yeah yeah<br>everybody looks very young and healthy<br>in this room that's what I think yeah<br>yeah<br>um so the short answer to the question<br>is immigration our biggest handbrake to<br>the economy is yes<br>um the long answer to that is and I'm<br>going to take the lead here from some of<br>our speakers this morning is reflecting<br>on the fact that we've just been through<br>the experiment of what two years of no<br>immigration looks like and what we know<br>from that is during that period more new<br>zealanders and international people left<br>the country than came into it we have<br>one of the highest outbound rates of<br>people of any developed country so<br>actually that is some of the stuff that<br>that drives our alliance on immigration<br>and it's not the fault of the migrants<br>that we haven't planned or coordinated<br>infrastructure for the last 30 years to<br>be able to meet that growth because<br>actually when you look at the history of<br>immigration in New Zealand it has<br>roughly followed the flows of the labor<br>market when we have an extraordinarily<br>tight labor market immigration is up and<br>people looking for economic<br>opportunities won't come here if the<br>jobs aren't here so<br>overall our immigration system has<br>actually served in New Zealand<br>extraordinarily well and I think what we<br>see now is skill shortages across every<br>industry every region and every level<br>so when we look at the the current<br>policies and what we've gone through to<br>get to the point where we can open the<br>border and welcome immigration back<br>again<br>um unfortunately it's it's a lot harder<br>to turn everything back on than it was<br>to turn it off<br>um and we're seeing that now in terms of<br>thinking about how competitive is New<br>Zealand internationally on attracting<br>those skills because all of the<br>countries that we compare ourselves to<br>have gone out there and said immigration<br>is a key pillar of our economic recovery<br>um uh and if they've gone out there with<br>with big offers right Canada has set up<br>one and a half million people in the<br>next three years will be given permanent<br>residency<br>we are still trying to work out what<br>those Pathways to residency look like in<br>New Zealand so we've got to make sure<br>that we can be internationally<br>competitive to be able to attract the<br>kind of skills that John's been talking<br>about<br>thanks very much it wouldn't be much of<br>a panel if we agreed so actually my<br>short answer to the subtitle of this<br>panel is immigration the biggest<br>handbreak is actually a no it's a no<br>four weeks ago and it's still a no now<br>despite the new labor demands that you<br>know a recent tragic events have brought<br>along uh it's worth pointing out and if<br>I could have that I have one one and<br>only slide and so if that slide could go<br>up uh for me thanks that<br>well if you're responsible for me to say<br>no and then to say well what is the<br>biggest handbrake and of course the<br>biggest handbrake is a persistently poor<br>productivity performance and so this is<br>the last four sentences of the last four<br>censuses and the um the colors at least<br>the first two bars are self-explanatory<br>we're black uh friends Across The Tasman<br>are in green uh and then the other three<br>bars are small oecd less than four<br>million less than six million or less<br>than 10 million okay so all of these are<br>are comparators for what might New<br>Zealand<br>um be in a different uh universe as it<br>were so New Zealand went from 18 foreign<br>born at the 2001 census to 26 foreign<br>born and so we were increasing the<br>foreign-born share at Double the rate of<br>Australia so we've already experienced<br>with large-scale immigration we're now<br>about 140 percent of the foreign-born<br>share that the other small oecd<br>countries have compared to you know<br>they've stated about 10 12 roughly no<br>Trend in those countries now what<br>happened whilst uh we we ran that<br>experiment government of very<br>large-scale immigration while if you<br>divide the economy into the part which<br>is is tradable it's subject to<br>International competition so there's<br>people producing for export but there's<br>also local firms competing against<br>Imports then in Real GDP per capita<br>terms the tradable sector of the economy<br>is no larger than it was two decades ago<br>all of the growth in the New Zealand<br>economy by and large has occurred in the<br>non-traded sector<br>is this a coincidence with the<br>immigration story has it causally<br>related I can think of well-respected<br>economists formerly at the IMF sorry and<br>at the IMF and at The Reserve Bank of<br>New Zealand and the treasury who would<br>argue it is causally related I'll leave<br>others to to delve into that but it's<br>clearly the case that this large-scale<br>experiment of of massive immigration by<br>historic standards and by the standards<br>of air comparative countries uh didn't<br>yield a productivity miracle for us at<br>all<br>um and whether it will going forward is<br>is<br>um is an open question and people might<br>say well you know why do we worry about<br>the fact that the economy is<br>increasingly skewed to the non-traded<br>part of the economy rather than to the<br>trade Department well if I'm a consumer<br>in New Zealand and I'm thinking about<br>consuming a tradable good and I don't<br>like the New Zealand product because I<br>don't think the the supplier has been<br>keeping up with with the latest designs<br>or haven't been responsible by needs I<br>can I can go on to Amazon I can go onto<br>eBay and I can import it okay there's<br>some pressure onto the the the supplier<br>and that's true for goods and services<br>certainly true for us in the in the<br>education business<br>um likewise the consumer overseas who<br>likes or doesn't like the New Zealand<br>export product has got a bunch of<br>Alternatives but if I'm trying to build<br>a house if I'm trying to get a resource<br>consent and I don't like the local<br>product I can't go on to Amazon and dial<br>it up even if I can go to Ikea and get a<br>flat pack house I can't import the land<br>okay and so the<br>supplier of non-traded goods and<br>services which is the vast majority of<br>the New Zealand economy is just under<br>much less competitive pressure much less<br>Innovative pressure and so we've seen<br>increasingly you know low productivity<br>because there isn't the pressure on<br>these and whilst we globalized on the<br>people front shown exactly by these<br>Rising black bars here shown exactly by<br>the sort of more micro stories from from<br>my two panelists we de-globalized on the<br>trades front and so all of these other<br>countries in this but that lie Behind<br>These Bars in this graph we're greatly<br>increasing their share of trade to GDP<br>Australia is below us but it's<br>increasing at much faster rate all of<br>the other small oecd countries are much<br>more tradable so we became less good at<br>trade and goods and services even as we<br>became better at importing people again<br>are they causally related time will tell<br>the second thing to note is that<br>immigration can often<br>paper over serious cracks so the obvious<br>question and perhaps the next panel is<br>going to answer this is well why has the<br>New Zealand education system not<br>delivered the the workforce which is<br>required why are we needing to go to<br>um there now obviously a self-interested<br>plug why do we have two medical schools<br>not three medical schools if we're so<br>short of doctors right but I'll tell you<br>another one and and and this one is is I<br>think very concerning<br>um<br>normally when the labor force survey<br>comes out of New Zealand it's only<br>quarterly it comes out if you know so<br>we've got the December household labor<br>force survey came out a few few weeks<br>ago only once per year in the June<br>quarter so we get the data in August<br>thereabouts we get the figures on<br>disability okay and so you may or may<br>not be aware that<br>um from June 2019 to June 2022 the<br>working age population that's<br>non-disabled so working age population<br>15 to 64 I think it is<br>um Rose by three percent so it didn't<br>have much population growth because a<br>Big Driver of population growth in New<br>Zealand in the short term is is<br>immigration of course and that was<br>largely closed off from the start of<br>2020.<br>the disabled population in the household<br>labor force survey grew by 13 and a half<br>percent so why are working age new<br>zealanders suddenly so much sicker okay<br>and this is not because of population<br>aging because we're staying within the<br>same time time range okay<br>um now well<br>um so and and and and and why does this<br>matter well if we look at the employment<br>rate and this is the employment over the<br>population rate so it rolls together<br>both the labor force participation rate<br>and the unemployment rate then the<br>employment rate for non-disabled in the<br>household labor force survey is 71 so 29<br>of working age population are either not<br>in the labor force or or are unemployed<br>okay and that's really that's a really<br>high rate right it's hard to get much<br>more participation than that but the<br>employment rate for the disabled uh<br>population is 25 so as we move people<br>from<br>um non-disabled into disabled for<br>whatever reason and and there are lots<br>of reasons for why it may be and I may<br>mention one depending on if I want to<br>get invited back next year<br>um then we see a basically a negative<br>shock to labor productivity the ability<br>of the economy to produce goods and<br>services goes down because we've got<br>this huge fall in in employment rates<br>from 71 to 25 but there's another Factor<br>too given our our approach to funding<br>health and disability it's very likely<br>that as we have more and more disabled<br>people that's going to be more Health<br>expenditure whereas if we have for<br>example and and that's a problem which<br>is unlikely to shift from New Zealand<br>most other countries are are generally<br>employing some health related tests<br>which would make it relatively hard for<br>someone with a disability which stops<br>them from from participating in<br>employment to also move somewhere else<br>and so this is a problem which we've got<br>for the expected lifetime of of this<br>group now you know what's causing it you<br>know long covert perhaps okay it was<br>already happening in 2021 too this is<br>not just specific to New Zealand the US<br>is seeing huge rise in disabilities in<br>the U.S at least and wherever this<br>occurs in New Zealand I don't know it's<br>up for others to to research it but at<br>the U.S at least there's pretty strong<br>evidence of some vaccine injury okay and<br>so again because we're not able to talk<br>about certain topics openly in New<br>Zealand then and the people who may be<br>affected by this are probably being I<br>believe the term is gaslit into saying<br>oh there isn't something wrong with you<br>it's in your head I don't know if that's<br>true or false but using variety of<br>different approaches in the US they're<br>getting up to figures of six or seven<br>percent uh of people who are suffering<br>uh serious adverse reactions which in<br>many cases are hampering their Workforce<br>participation right and so this is not<br>restricted to us and of course now<br>healthcare workers become more and more<br>important if we've got a a population<br>which is becoming less and less healthy<br>uh and so I think we've got to look just<br>first of all understand well what's<br>driving what's making new zealanders so<br>much less well than they were before and<br>maybe it's simple maybe it's just a<br>pandemic okay but but as I said the<br>timing and the positioning and the<br>similarity into other sectors means is<br>potentially something else going on as<br>well and so we can't rely I think on<br>immigration to to paper over these more<br>fundamental cracks okay and then the<br>other thing I was going to say too are<br>going back to the slide and the slide<br>can go in a moment we probably had the<br>worst possible combination we had<br>permissive immigration settings and very<br>restrictive land land<br>conversion or Urban Land Supply settings<br>and so that of course drove really high<br>house prices but it also drove home<br>ownership rates of the native born down<br>significantly and not just in the places<br>where immigrants were settling in high<br>proportion so not just in Queenstown<br>lakes or in parts of Auckland but<br>spilling over into the neighboring areas<br>as people can compete with the rising<br>house prices new zealanders or native<br>born were moving elsewhere putting more<br>pressure on there and so our home<br>ownership rates fell well if I'm no<br>longer owning a home in New Zealand I'm<br>much more likely to to move abroad you<br>know one of the main constraints to<br>moving is the fact you own a home and<br>it's a lot harder to do and if we<br>believe that home ownership is important<br>it's rare to find any politician who<br>would get up and say I don't think home<br>ownership's important and so if we<br>believe that then we had permissive<br>immigration restricted land use Supply<br>we could have been permissive and<br>permissive so Texas for example<br>permissive immigration permissive land<br>Supply and it manages to keep housing<br>prices about three times incomes we<br>could have been really restrictive on<br>both perhaps Japan really hard to move<br>to and settle in Japan really hard to<br>release land but we had a particular<br>combination for weather luck or or not<br>uh which gave us what is essentially a<br>really large housing crisis which then<br>moves into a migration crisis because of<br>young new zealanders don't think they're<br>going to own a house then Australia<br>suddenly looks quite a lot more<br>attractive<br>thank you very much for uh those<br>comments from each of our three<br>panelists we've got lots of questions<br>that are coming through on the slido app<br>and of course it's a very rich<br>conversation with um with a range of<br>different insights that we can drill<br>into here if people have got questions<br>from the floor please do raise your hand<br>and we'll get a mic brought out for you<br>and I'll watch out for anyone waving if<br>you can give me a little wave too to let<br>me know that'd be good but I'm going to<br>start with a question that's come<br>through from online and perhaps I'll<br>address it Rachel to to use to begin<br>with but um both of the Johns may want<br>to to chip in as well particularly on<br>the healthcare aspect we've seen this<br>tightening in these changes in<br>the question is is it time for a<br>national conversation on what the ideal<br>setting should be and how would you see<br>us moving forward best on changing<br>immigration settings I guess more the<br>structure of those settings and the<br>precise nature of those settings so how<br>do we get the structure of those savings<br>improved yeah absolutely and I think<br>it's time to have that discussion<br>um and<br>luckily in an election year and these<br>discussions frequently come up so<br>um the settings around New Zealand's<br>immigration policy I mean we have some<br>natural advantages we're a small island<br>at the bottom of the world so actually<br>we we control our immigration flows<br>through our policy settings<br>um now I think you know part of the<br>heart of the argument and why it's good<br>to do disagree with our colleagues as a<br>uh I'd be interested in your thoughts<br>for example around where monetary policy<br>sits in our housing market and and those<br>kind of factors as well<br>um I think that touching on what are the<br>policies that are that are going to work<br>we do need to keep in mind that there<br>are people at the end of this policy<br>system<br>um what we see in touching on your<br>comments about increased disability in<br>the workforce is we're seeing Workforce<br>that's burnt out because they're working<br>more hours they're working harder just<br>to try and keep their heads above water<br>it's incredibly challenging right now to<br>be a small business owner in New Zealand<br>and the line from The Horizon was um was<br>coming out of covert and actually now<br>we've got a whole bunch of other other<br>challenges now part of the relief of<br>that is allowing people in and bringing<br>those skills in and reconnecting with<br>the world so I think that discussion<br>will happen<br>um this year in in an election year<br>um<br>trying to move that to a sensible<br>long-term immigration discussion and<br>away from what is often a polarizing<br>discussion<br>um is I think one of the really big<br>challenges but we have a wealth of<br>evidence and information out there about<br>immigration I think obviously we can<br>have the spirit of debate and the<br>ability to to uh to thresh these things<br>out<br>but we do need to keep in mind that the<br>people on the other end of this<br>including those who choose to contribute<br>to New Zealand and bring their<br>international skills here we haven't<br>always treated them very nicely and part<br>of the answer to this is making sure<br>that our immigration system is effective<br>it's efficient it's predictable<br>and ideally not subject to change every<br>three years<br>thanks John did you want to add anything<br>on the health educations I I from my<br>perspective I think um Nicolas has done<br>it before I think it's an Andy and um<br>you know from a Workforce perspective we<br>need to train more we need to increase<br>our productivity because I think some of<br>the training that we deliver from an<br>industry perspective doesn't deliver<br>productivity it's delivering a product<br>that's misaligned with what the industry<br>is needing so that's um one kind of<br>component to it but I also think there's<br>a bigger kind of discussion that needs<br>to be had about the commander control<br>kind of piece you know the role of<br>government in this about should it be<br>all about control and flicking levers or<br>should it be about empowerment to allow<br>industry uh to get on with innovating<br>because often it feels so hard to<br>innovate uh you know examples of<br>bringing an alternative<br>clinicians or others to complement the<br>more traditional you can't get them<br>registered you know you've got colleges<br>you've got professional bodies and you<br>you also have government who get quite<br>confronted with that but I think also<br>really importantly it's the models in<br>which we run our traditional health<br>system on um you know covert was often<br>talked about as a way of digitalizing<br>and moving here out of a out of a room<br>with a clinician and moving some of it<br>online<br>but what we're seeing is that shrunk<br>back or you know roared back um to the<br>more traditional approach much more<br>quickly than people thought it was going<br>to happen but look what we find that we<br>we have new zealanders who are<br>registered who work for us and the<br>company I work for now who live all over<br>the world<br>um and they're great because they can<br>work for us in the middle of their night<br>which is the middle of our day or vice<br>versa and that's that's that's<br>um provides different options for them<br>uh we have people who say we're actually<br>over winter I want to do cross-country<br>skiing and I want to live in Wanaka but<br>I still want to be a doctor for the<br>community that I am we allow them to<br>live in in Wanaka do the cross-country<br>skiing in the morning have a wee nap and<br>then work for us from two to eight<br>online but the public system doesn't<br>kind of behave like that it's very<br>traditional in the sense that you come<br>to work<br>um you know we have these shifts and<br>it's all very facility based which is<br>also really capital and tense so I think<br>there needs to be a bigger debate about<br>uh what are what do our modern public<br>um how health services look like and how<br>can we ensure that we've got a Workforce<br>available to us through both the<br>training systems<br>um in schemes but also that we can<br>import and bring in through immigration<br>to to create greater productivity I mean<br>it's such an interesting point isn't it<br>because we've seen covert had sped up so<br>many trends that we've been seeing<br>across all sorts of economies worldwide<br>and of course moving things online was<br>one of those things that was starting to<br>happen before covert and covert sped it<br>up so in healthcare it's a really<br>interesting situation where you might<br>have that possibility to substitute<br>online services in some cases is for<br>in-person services or indeed in the<br>example you gave complementary because<br>there's people who are willing to look<br>overnight and and view scans or whatever<br>it is overnight and feedback that<br>information sorry Rachel did you were<br>you waiting to jump in there oh no just<br>to actually wildly agree for once yeah<br>it's a nand end right yeah we need to<br>look at immigration I agree with you we<br>need to think about the trainings system<br>and you know we have seen some really<br>big shifts in that over the last couple<br>of years in terms of the number of<br>apprenticeships that have come into the<br>system so our pipeline at the moment is<br>actually looking more positive than it<br>has for a number of years but<br>um and we also need good active late<br>Market policies in terms of thinking<br>about how do you how do you help get<br>people into work<br>and if I can make one other comment one<br>of my other jobs as I chair one of New<br>Zealand's largest private schools and we<br>are full it's literally enroll your<br>child with a midwife<br>um to get in and I think that's<br>reflective also of concern of you know<br>what the education system is delivering<br>um to some new zealanders or not<br>delivering and you know why you know we<br>we thought well some of this is driven<br>by covert people's choices have changed<br>they're choosing to invest in um earlier<br>education in a different kind of way but<br>those Trends are not buttoning off<br>um in fact the demand seems to be going<br>the other way so it goes back to your<br>point um around productivity we need<br>greater productivity across a lot of our<br>public services so how does government<br>facilitate that without overcooking it<br>and then we need to be able to enable<br>other Industries to get on with those so<br>get out of it enable it<br>um in a really different way which is<br>really similar to I think some of the<br>discussions that were coming up this<br>morning<br>just just one one small point on uh the<br>issue as to the control we have yes as<br>you know said we've got a we've got a<br>huge moat so it's a long way to swim so<br>we don't have major problems of illegals<br>but it's not as easily controllable as<br>as might first be seen unless we're<br>going to return to the uh frankly<br>shameful circumstances where New Zealand<br>citizens were not able to return and it<br>took grounded kiwis to you know take the<br>government to court and so forth because<br>we've got you know close to a million<br>new zealanders who have the right to<br>return who are living overseas I've<br>forgotten Jack's poeters right here he<br>might remind me there was a paper from<br>Motu which I think argued it was the<br>returning new zealanders who were<br>putting more impact on house prices than<br>the than the the brand new migrants and<br>on the other end with the trans-tasman<br>travel Arrangement then also we have uh<br>considerable fluidity across there and<br>similarly Australia cannot really run an<br>independent migration policy at least<br>with respect to the Pacific Islanders so<br>there's far more Polynesians in<br>Australia than we would be expected when<br>we would expect more melanesians given<br>Australia's closeness and that because<br>partly because Australia doesn't have<br>control once once while under current<br>Visa settings at least once people<br>establish New Zealand citizenship then<br>they've got free rights have moved there<br>so it's actually not quite as as easy<br>for some Central policy maker to you<br>know turn the wheel a little bit this<br>and this because people have a lot of<br>freedoms or and a rights well again<br>unless we are going to abrogate those<br>rights as happened in the past which<br>hopefully we don't ever see a game<br>and quite a few of those comments from<br>from our panelists actually touched on<br>some of the questions that are coming<br>through in terms of things like<br>regulation and also the macro impacts of<br>of immigration so we'll hopefully we'll<br>we'll get some of those as well but just<br>a little bit of a follow-up question on<br>is this immigration settings I mean do<br>we really need to focus on skilled or<br>unskilled I mean we've got the<br>telecommuters but we've also got a lot<br>of Need for unskilled workers um and I<br>think some of the the scenes around the<br>country in in recent weeks is really<br>reminded us of the importance of having<br>a lot of unskilled labor available to<br>assist with all those sorts of things so<br>um John perhaps we'll start with you on<br>on this one<br>um okay so so very quickly I've for over<br>a decade my colleague a New Zealander at<br>the World Bank in Washington DC and I uh<br>looked at basically three parts of the<br>Pacific to New Zealand migration so<br>highly skilled people uh and new<br>zealanders going people coming from the<br>Pacific coming people chosen by random<br>ballot which solves a lot of technical<br>issues this is a specific access code<br>motor and some Oakwood and then the uh<br>recognized seasonal employment RSE<br>workers who many people call unskilled I<br>wouldn't call it unskilled it's skilled<br>in a particular way and I think it's<br>work that the vast majority of us would<br>not like to I grew up on a farm I know a<br>few people grew up on farms nearby and<br>it's really hard work and indeed we saw<br>that return workers had a premium so<br>there was some skill component and<br>employers wanted to get them and what we<br>find is that<br>um<br>they tend to be complementary so if if<br>you attract skill if you've got a let's<br>say a point space system which is trying<br>to attract skilled workers well that<br>actually creates the demand also for for<br>Less skilled Walkers people with less<br>formal skills in it and so again the<br>sort of ability that we can we can fine<br>tune and we can just turn up this dial a<br>little bit and this one down a little<br>bit I think is is a bit misleading um<br>people have a desire for Freedom people<br>have a desire to see their own<br>circumstances in their children's<br>circumstances improve and they will move<br>when the constraints are restricted when<br>the constraints are removed to do that<br>and so we see that but I do think we can<br>learn something from from looking at<br>some of the Pacific island countries if<br>you know that you're going to have a<br>very mobile population then it changes<br>some of the settings you may not want to<br>have a tax base which is highly reliant<br>on a very narrow mobile group of the<br>population because you you you you you<br>pluck the pluck the goose too much and<br>the goose is going to go somewhere else<br>and so<br>um you might want to have a pretty broad<br>base tax you might want to be based on<br>the assumption that people might be<br>sending remittances we don't know how<br>much people send remittances to to New<br>Zealand new zealanders who have been<br>successful gone overseas earning a lot<br>of money and what we were showing is<br>that for the skilled people there was a<br>frontier of about a hundred thousand us<br>per year wasn't didn't matter if you're<br>coming from the Pacific to New Zealand<br>going from New Zealand to Europe or<br>Australia or to the US highly skilled<br>people were basically those who chose to<br>return or come back we're leaving that<br>much on the table and the things which<br>were causing them do it were again<br>almost nothing that governments could<br>alter it was desire to see um elderly<br>parents desire for children to have the<br>experience that these adults themselves<br>had when they were children and almost<br>none of it was the little you know<br>fine-tuning that that government<br>immigration departments might try to do<br>to incentivize them to come back or<br>something which is which is perhaps a<br>little bit too nihilistic<br>um but you've just got to make it a nice<br>a nice place to live in a sense and<br>allow people to then sort and settle so<br>yeah<br>um yeah I I don't actually like the term<br>unskilled and scared it's an unfortunate<br>one isn't it yeah there's agriculture<br>often you know in the international data<br>sets unskilled generally going to the<br>agricultural sector but I don't know<br>that that's at all the case for us no<br>and this has been a very ongoing<br>argument in in sectors like aged care<br>for example and the carers who come in<br>who I think do an amazing job<br>um I think the we do need to look at our<br>immigration system and totality and we<br>need to take a broader view of this<br>stuff because it's not just work visas<br>that come into the country it's<br>investors it's entrepreneurs uh and<br>obviously the family connections which<br>has been a massive driver<br>um what we do need is Visa labor market<br>data to be able to understand how that<br>stuff is Shifting and to understand are<br>we actually<br>utilizing the skills as effectively as<br>we can because as much as we talk about<br>immigration yeah we don't talk as much<br>about occupational licensing and how do<br>we accelerate that process because you<br>could get your visa and wait another 10<br>months to still get into the country we<br>don't talk about recognition of<br>international qualifications very much<br>it's another big bit of the system and<br>how do we recognize prior learning and<br>the skills that come to the country that<br>maybe don't come from a country where we<br>recognize their qualification so there's<br>a lot that we can do in terms of<br>thinking about that broader View and<br>getting the planning right I think is<br>critically important because if you<br>think about the critical workers for<br>example<br>um who who are at the front line during<br>covert Supermarket workers making sure<br>that we all had toilet paper those<br>people wouldn't get through our<br>immigration settings now we gave them<br>residency the The Residency Visa 2021<br>and the forecast on that was it would be<br>65 000 people it's turned out to be 209<br>000. so you know we've we've got to be a<br>lot sharper at being able to understand<br>what the shifts in the labor market are<br>doing and provide the flexibility and<br>Agility in that labor market for<br>companies to respond<br>and thanks also for that that point<br>distinguishing between skilled and<br>unskilled it's an unfortunate<br>categorization and I guess in in your<br>sector as well you see this John you'd<br>probably think of lower skilled and<br>higher skilled than unskilled and and<br>skilled wouldn't you partially but I<br>think you know we've got some really sad<br>stories of the de-skilling that the<br>legislation does so you know I think of<br>one clinic in central Auckland that<br>we've got we've got seven foreign<br>trained doctors whose qualifications are<br>not recognized in New Zealand and so the<br>operating as Health Center assistance on<br>28 an hour now<br>um that's just not right uh they're the<br>most incredibly you know a couple of<br>them are Specialists they're not not<br>just generalists<br>um and the way that our system is<br>configured there's just not enough<br>positions in the dhbs or the hospitals<br>to put them through the the kind of<br>catch-up kind of training program so you<br>often hear about the taxi drivers or the<br>others that are kind of sitting there<br>these people have made the choice to<br>come to New Zealand they've come with<br>families they've come with partners and<br>they're contributing and yet we are kind<br>of constraining the level of<br>contribution they can make because of<br>Bureau bureaucratic process and I you<br>know that that struggle with the other<br>comment I'll make is you know we've got<br>to remember demographics and all of this<br>I can't remember the actual figure so I<br>don't want to make it up but the the<br>number of 85 year olds is is is doubling<br>at a rate that it's never doubled at<br>before and with that comes a significant<br>increase in the in the type of<br>um care that we need to provide to keep<br>people at home uh with their family<br>funnel out of out of hospitals<br>um and we don't and can't find that<br>Workforce either and if you look at a<br>community like giraffity I know looking<br>at our health stats and uh sorry our<br>demographic stats on there you know it<br>swung for the first time ever the the<br>smallest portion of the population is<br>the working age group and young people<br>and retirees<br>um you know make up uh the bulk of the<br>population so from an economic from a<br>Workforce from a whole lot of<br>perspective it just doesn't work anymore<br>so so you know how do we stack that up<br>and how do we make sure throw on top of<br>that a cyclone and you crash a whole lot<br>of the economic contributors into that<br>as well it just seems complex so there's<br>lots of discussion I think we need to<br>have here isn't it and those regulatory<br>issues and these sorts of things would<br>also impact other sectors now some of<br>the issues that you talked about are<br>quite specific to the health sector but<br>I wonder when we're thinking about these<br>settings how much we can do at a general<br>level and how much has to be done at<br>that sectoral level John you know I<br>guess the question is in what sense are<br>the constraints<br>peculiar to the health sector<br>differentiated from other sectors and to<br>to what extent are those constraints and<br>the potential Solutions which I hope you<br>might um provide a couple of brief<br>insights on<br>um to what extent would they be specific<br>to the health sector or more<br>generalizable yeah and and I think if<br>you take it back to the education sector<br>I think there's other interesting things<br>starting to occur there now I'm sitting<br>in a university I've got a couple of<br>degrees from here but<br>um actually micro credentialing online<br>through the likes of AWS and Microsoft<br>are probably going to give young people<br>quicker and better earning kind of<br>outcomes in the short term than the<br>traditional path of going through a<br>tertiary education now I say that and<br>there's a kind of shiver I think because<br>the traditional model of what education<br>should and look like but if you think<br>about the capital cost and stuff that we<br>have caught up in this whereas we could<br>be fast tracking productivity into the<br>system using um you know some of those<br>other opportunities you know how do we<br>adapt which I think was a theme that<br>came through this morning as well<br>thanks I think we've got a question from<br>just taking it back to the stage of the<br>labor market I'm interested in if any of<br>you have a comment on abatement rates on<br>beneficiaries which<br>disincentivizes work past about six to<br>foreign<br>I see a couple of people here who are<br>currently or formally in the treasury uh<br>who I think it the the interface between<br>between the benefit system and and<br>Market work and that is devilishly<br>complex uh is all I'll say<br>um and so I I don't I'm not going to<br>give you an answer I'm going to<br>Sidetrack it but but that's the sort of<br>thing which which treasury has experts<br>on in terms of abatements<br>um and yes we know the problem the<br>problem is that people can be trapped<br>okay it can be the case that uh things<br>to to which in other circumstances would<br>make someone uh better off by working<br>more hours or something like that can<br>actually make them worse off and and the<br>designers and the implementers<br>understand that but there is no there is<br>no perfect benefit system<br>um that's been yet developed for dealing<br>with that<br>uh<br>you can keep commenting we'll get the<br>microphone over to the front please go<br>ahead Rachel no I was just going to say<br>the the uh I touched on active labor<br>market programs in terms of the<br>abatement rates is something that would<br>need to be looked at within that context<br>because we do know that there are a<br>number of barriers to work for people<br>that has nothing to do with the jobs not<br>being available so the question is what<br>is the social interventions that you you<br>wrap around that<br>that enables people to be able to step<br>into that and what is effective and no<br>country gets the active labor market<br>policy stuff right but things like<br>things like apprenticeships that allow<br>people to to take on skills as they<br>enter the workforce and making sure<br>there's a balance there in terms of the<br>other factors that make it accessible as<br>we just got a slight word on demography<br>I mean I'm amazed that we can talk about<br>immigration and population and don't<br>talk about the massive change that's<br>occurring with demography in other words<br>pure babies have been born and we've got<br>a very aging societies just about this<br>whole room will be on the pension in 20<br>years<br>but I mean that's reality we're going to<br>double the number over 65.<br>nobody's doing any work to say we can<br>afford that<br>and that's the bright miserable bastards<br>like me taking the age at up to 65 from<br>60 which was considered a disaster I<br>mean what we have to really concentrate<br>I encourage our panel is to what's the<br>impact of demography this very rapidly<br>declining birth rate really across the<br>world but we're just talking about New<br>Zealand and occasion you'll see an<br>article about China but it's not China<br>China certainly has that problem we're<br>at large Japan's even further advice but<br>we're there now and this has enormous<br>implications for immigration policy and<br>Workforce and where they're going to<br>come from<br>thanks for that and maybe I'll also wrap<br>in a question there's quite a few<br>questions coming through on New<br>Zealand's International competitiveness<br>and that has that ties in with this<br>demography issue so perhaps a panelist<br>would like to um respond to the the<br>question and also on competitiveness<br>um well very very I'm going to be in<br>South Korea next month which has the<br>world's lowest it's 0.78<br>um live births per per<br>um fertile woman of except exactly how<br>the definition is<br>um so so the Hope in some other<br>countries and I don't know if that's the<br>case in New Zealand or not is<br>robotization uh obviously it is is<br>immigrants too but people are competing<br>for the same same pool of immigrants<br>um the other aspect of it though too is<br>it's not homogeneous and so if we divide<br>this by ethnic group then we see vast<br>differences in not only age structure<br>but related to age structure fertility<br>and so it's also changing the<br>composition of countries as well<br>um dramatically and again which requires<br>you know program more adult<br>conversations than have been done to<br>date see ya<br>I'd just say I completely agree the<br>demographics of our country is a massive<br>Challenge and we've got to pretty<br>quickly grapple with with how it's going<br>to look and how we're going to pay for<br>it um I think when you look at the<br>outbound flows it is Young skilled new<br>zealanders that leave when you look it<br>out inbound foes by and large it is<br>working age population<br>and part of what we need to look at<br>within the immigration discussion is how<br>we welcome families now there's a<br>there's a policy change coming into<br>effect shortly which will work test<br>Partners<br>um which I think will will have a bit of<br>a chilling effect on on families that<br>want to come and contribute to New<br>Zealand and settle and that's what we<br>I I absolutely agree<br>um it's a massive Challenge and I think<br>the other thing that we need to think<br>about is that the evidence is really<br>clear that outside of you know<br>procedural work having you have replaced<br>or your knee replaced in healthcare you<br>get much better outcome if you receive<br>health support from someone similar to<br>yourself so the other thing that we need<br>to really consider is that our ethnic<br>mixes can is changing considerably<br>across New Zealand and so you know if<br>you look at Auckland uh you look at a<br>large urban area or you look at the<br>regions<br>um what we have today is not what's<br>going to be there tomorrow so when it<br>comes to Workforce and immigration and<br>productivity and building capability we<br>need to keep that in the back of our<br>mind particularly from a health<br>perspective<br>you respond better to someone you feel<br>comfortable with and you feel like you<br>can establish a relationship with<br>and that's not what our health Workforce<br>looks like the health workers will be<br>have today is not right for the<br>population that's emerging for New<br>Zealand for tomorrow so that's an<br>additional kind of challenge that we<br>need to kind of build in there and how<br>do we train for that you know that's a<br>local local partially a local thing but<br>it's also recognizing that immigration<br>is changing the the ethnic mix as well<br>so<br>um yeah lots in there thanks and we had<br>lots of questions I'm sorry we are going<br>to have to stop the questions now<br>because we're out of time but we've got<br>lots of questions also on International<br>Education that I would love to ask<br>because we're leading into the next<br>panel which of course is focusing on<br>education but I do encourage people<br>during the break which we'll have<br>afterwards to pick up those<br>conversations thank you so much to our<br>panelists for those rich and diverse<br>insights into immigration and Associated<br>issues<br>they're nice comfy seats up here<br>and so we're moving directly on to our<br>our second session this afternoon which<br>as I alluded to just before at the end<br>of that last session is looking at<br>education so it's a shame that we didn't<br>quite get the chance to tie in those<br>those previous questions but I'm looking<br>forward to some active conversations<br>during the break and perhaps some of<br>them will come up in our session after<br>the break which will be on governments<br>as well I think that all of us in this<br>room would agree that education is an<br>absolutely key contributor to<br>sustainable growth and productivity and<br>well-being and I'm sure that we all<br>agree that but it's a big cost to<br>government as as well and it's difficult<br>to get right including for the diverse<br>and perhaps even evolving student<br>population that it's serving so what<br>we're doing in this session is we're<br>turning to put schools under the<br>microscope<br>um with a particular focus on how we<br>turn around any things that need turning<br>around in those schools our panelists<br>for this session we're great it's it's<br>great that we've got a wealth of<br>experience here we've got our first<br>speaker will be Francis Valentine uh<br>Francis is the founder and CEO of<br>Academy x uh the Mind lab and Tech<br>Futures lab you might also have heard of<br>uh our second speaker will be Arwin Paul<br>uh Alwyn is the co-founder and the lead<br>of innovative education consultants and<br>our third speaker is Susan Hassell uh<br>Susan is the Headmaster of Hamilton boys<br>high school so she'll be known to a<br>number of us in the audience those of<br>you that have got sons that have been to<br>Hamilton boys high school will be<br>familiar with Susan and the work that<br>she's done for an extended period of<br>time at Hamilton boys high school so I'd<br>like to pass straight to you please<br>differences<br>talking about the subject that's so<br>close to my heart<br>okay I've got it hopefully you can hear<br>me<br>Paul<br>um look I just want to start by picking<br>up on the last conversation around<br>demographics my role is to look at the<br>future needs of a Workforce and so<br>there's very much my focus of my<br>research and my activity and also at my<br>graduate schools and when we think about<br>demographics and education we cannot go<br>away from that right now we have a<br>significant shift in the way we are<br>thinking about training we have to think<br>about the types of jobs and how often<br>people will need to go back into the<br>workforce sorry back into training but<br>also if we start thinking about the<br>Aging population and where we are having<br>growth infertility which is in our Maori<br>Pacific in our immigrant communities and<br>so just an example I'll start with Tita<br>tokoro so the Northland of New Zealand<br>is a great example of what happens it's<br>our fastest growing region in the<br>country<br>it is predominantly been populated by<br>retired pakiha and we have a very large<br>youth-based Maori population<br>so the work that I've been doing up<br>there is really starting to focus on<br>what are the challenges there in<br>achievement what are how is the success<br>looking in terms of relevancy context<br>and actually what happens if you get it<br>wrong<br>and so if we start looking at a region<br>that is Advanced on the rest of the<br>country both in terms of where we're<br>going to be in terms of our population<br>being older and white and then we start<br>looking at the challenges of climate<br>change it's already been impacted<br>significantly in the region and then the<br>aotearoa but to leave to Australia<br>so the skill sets that we need we need<br>to be equal across all our demographic<br>groups right now in 2023 we have 283<br>000 people over the age of 65 working<br>versus 85 000 in 2010. we're going to<br>live longer so we need to train multiple<br>times and so we have to think about<br>education not in this sort of preloading<br>just in the school system but actually<br>how do we get smart people making<br>strategic decisions throughout our<br>entire country so we do need to make<br>sure we have people studying going into<br>University and being highly skilled<br>so when I think of education and having<br>taught<br>in both in the compulsory sector on the<br>outside of the formal sector and also<br>now in the postgraduate space what I<br>note more than anything is the low<br>participation we have in education<br>so I'll start by talking about the<br>number of people in a country who go<br>into postgraduate study at Masters level<br>is just five percent<br>which is one of the lowest in the<br>developed world<br>we rely heavily on immigrants for our<br>top jobs we often talk about immigrants<br>coming in to take away our take on our<br>some of our low skill jobs but you only<br>need to look at the demographics and the<br>statistics around the types of roles<br>they take on which are often at the top<br>end of town they're making the most<br>strategic decisions on behalf of our<br>country<br>so for me when we go backwards to the<br>source of where this comes from<br>first of all the small Advanced economy<br>we have the biggest employer<br>is the government<br>the second biggest employer is a sole<br>Trader<br>so we don't have the International<br>Investment that other nations have you<br>know we run small businesses for a small<br>economy<br>the competitive nature of education is<br>not part of our DNA we rely on<br>International talent and capability in<br>many parts of our labor workforce<br>and then we have to talk about why do we<br>not value education<br>it goes all the way back into our<br>schools<br>and our schools right now are seeing<br>some challenges around record<br>absenteeism<br>context and relevance challenges<br>and we're starting to see that in a way<br>that we can only take and extrapolate<br>from that that if we don't do something<br>significant that actually more and more<br>people will opt out<br>of participating fully in education and<br>then all of the compounded effects that<br>we're already experiencing through<br>change become even greater<br>I'll start by using an example of a<br>library<br>if you think about a library as a place<br>that we all spent time growing up as a<br>source and in many cases the only source<br>of factual information<br>we've seen how much they have had to<br>Pivot and recreate reimagine what a<br>library is today and now they're often<br>places where there is community<br>participation there are often technology<br>that you can access there's ways of<br>collaborating<br>I went today and looked at the number of<br>roles for a librarian in New Zealand<br>right now<br>seven and one of those is for a toy<br>Library<br>I looked at data management<br>which is fundamentally what we're<br>talking about with libraries and we have<br>over 600 jobs<br>and so libraries have moved on a long<br>way and they're looking at context and<br>relevance all the time and yet for some<br>reason education we hold on as though we<br>have the problem with the school and<br>instead of saying schools under the<br>microscope I'd like to put out their<br>students under the microscope scope<br>because if we took a user-centric<br>customer focus design for the education<br>system we'd look at young people today<br>and say what would make school relevant<br>to them still keeping the focus on<br>quality of literacy numeracy digital<br>fluency but making sure they understand<br>where it's taking them in a world that<br>today more than ever we understand the<br>impact of Technologies such as<br>artificial intelligence and automation<br>and so if we don't take a<br>student-centric design we will continue<br>to argue the relevance of schools<br>and schools are merely in my world<br>buildings that house people to do<br>amazing things<br>so I'd like to pass over um to Owen or<br>um and and just just to leave it on that<br>note but I really want to think about<br>what does a student today need<br>so that when they hit 30 50 80 and then<br>a hundred<br>that they continue to learn and<br>education continues to be relevant fit<br>um<br>I'm one of those lucky people that<br>consider that I've never worked a day in<br>my life because I fell into teaching and<br>have loved every moment of it the<br>importance of it I think is graphically<br>Illustrated even in my family my mother<br>was born in 1934 into a home with 11<br>siblings in a state house in aramaha<br>wanganui uh I never meet my birth father<br>but my father-in-law who passed away a<br>few years ago he spent six years of his<br>young life in Holland under Nazi<br>oppression<br>um when we think about children standing<br>on the shoulders their parents those two<br>if they were still alive could look now<br>and see three of their grandchildren<br>through my family one is a fabulous<br>chemical engineer at regeneron in Albany<br>New York State one is a degree qualified<br>firefighter although I might say if you<br>own a home in remuera I'd think about<br>shifting and won a daughter who is about<br>to complete her PhD and I was going to<br>ask Matt really about an honorary PhD<br>for myself<br>I had a conversation with Ben Stokes on<br>Monday night and on the basis of that<br>made some Investments on Tuesday morning<br>and I've got enough money to make a fair<br>donation to the management School<br>um<br>a couple of anecdotes in terms of of<br>teaching and what makes it interesting<br>and keeps me in it one day I had Rodney<br>Hyde in my office as the minister or<br>assistant minister of education and of<br>course children didn't think of him as a<br>politician they thought of them as a<br>dancer<br>and so while we're sitting in the office<br>a young man called Alex who now works<br>for an organization called will enable<br>heavily autistic and he's out sweeping<br>the path and he looks through the window<br>and he sees Rodney<br>and he puts down the broom and I say<br>that Rodney I'm not responsible for what<br>this boy says<br>and uh so I see Alex stump around to<br>come through the front door across the<br>foyer<br>looks Rodney up and down and says you're<br>Rodney height<br>and Rodney graciously acknowledged that<br>fact and Alex says you're a lot fatter<br>than you look on TV<br>and turned around and walked out<br>uh and I had to apologize but Rodney was<br>a good sport<br>I've taught a lot of quirky kids and I<br>love them and they have to find their<br>place in our New Zealand education<br>system remember another little boy<br>called Harry was sitting at one of the<br>front desks and I looked over and he's<br>eating a glue stick<br>I said Harry donate the glue stick you<br>make yourself sick and he says mustafoet<br>says here non-toxic<br>and I said well okay but if you eat too<br>much of it it'll go right through your<br>digestive system and stick your butt<br>cheeks together and he says no when I<br>sit down I just pull those butt cheeks<br>apart and I'm fine<br>and these kids are everywhere in our<br>system<br>but in fact of the 815 000 kids in our<br>system they're all different and they<br>needed to be treated differently I had<br>the privilege of teaching my own<br>children I think one of the the huge<br>Solutions in our system is that teachers<br>teach as if every child is theirs and<br>bring the same standards to the table<br>there is no doubt that our education<br>system is in trouble there are two<br>reports that I released earlier this<br>week and are on your tables<br>and they add to the body of evidence<br>successive governments our Ministry of<br>Education and other interventions are<br>utterly failing<br>you can look at this from the<br>perspective of ethnicity or social<br>economics or the growing Divergence<br>between the achievement of girls as<br>opposed to boys<br>but in each case we need to understand<br>that the whole of society suffers<br>we've often looked at education from the<br>point that well my kids were right 75<br>percent of kids are all right it's less<br>than that now<br>but in fact the impact on those children<br>is massive a lot of them will never rent<br>a good home<br>they will never save to buy they'll<br>never take an OE they won't grow up to<br>support their own family it is a massive<br>societal problem<br>there are great schools so in one of the<br>reports I've highlighted some of them oh<br>for awesome Orange<br>and just one example Saint Paul's and<br>ponsonby four years ago the university<br>entrance for levers was 54 they're a<br>school that is 95 percent Maori and<br>Pacifica uh and through the leadership<br>of Kieran fui in four years they took<br>the yui to leave us for right up to 84<br>uh an exceptional effort<br>to me though the glaring solution is<br>parenting that is not to blame parents<br>for every issue but that's to say that<br>we now know through neuroscience and all<br>sorts of advances exactly what should<br>happen during the time a child develops<br>within the womb<br>exactly what should happen in the first<br>zero to three uh then three to five<br>years<br>but we don't apply it and many of our<br>families don't know it so the heaviest<br>thing that I'm advocating for and<br>hearing good responses on is that we<br>need a crown entity for parenting<br>not one that tells people what to do and<br>enforces it but one that spreads the<br>information about what good parenting<br>practices are I have never met a parent<br>in my 30 years of education that doesn't<br>love the child and want good things for<br>their child but I've met thousands who<br>don't know how<br>and it's no longer an excuse thank you<br>yes I am Susan Hassell and thank you<br>very very much for having me this<br>afternoon Alan made the typical<br>teacher's mistake of handing out the<br>reading material while he spoke so I can<br>ask you now as a typical teacher to put<br>your reading material down and listen<br>very carefully to me for the next two<br>and a half minutes that Ellen has left<br>me to speak in my allotted five minutes<br>so thank you very much Owen uh I was I<br>will speak quickly because I come to<br>this perspective this afternoon as a<br>practitioner as a person who has<br>invested 40 years in a school I've been<br>Headmaster for 23 years so I've seen<br>iterations of the educational Journey<br>where many many initiatives have<br>occurred and I've lived through them<br>seen the impact of them on on their<br>young men so it's a real pleasure to<br>have this opportunity to speak with two<br>people who have have looked at it<br>through a different lens or a different<br>microscope if you like but but do have a<br>lot of wisdom and what they're offering<br>but I'm coming to it from a pragmatic<br>perspective of what matters most to our<br>young people in education at the moment<br>and I acknowledge there is a genuine<br>problem in our education system it's not<br>the problem that you might see reflected<br>in that data because my first point<br>really is that data is easily<br>manipulated and it and it doesn't<br>necessarily show the reality but there<br>is a genuine problem that both of the<br>people up here with me this afternoon<br>have highlighted in those and those<br>those problems have been exaggerate<br>exacerbated by covert but really just<br>highlighted by covert they've been<br>growing problems in our Secondary School<br>sector for some time and and as a person<br>who loves these boys and they are boys<br>in my case you see the impact of it and<br>it really is a point that New Zealand<br>has reached in terms of its economic<br>future from your perspective but in<br>terms of our social future that we have<br>to stop and look and see what else we<br>can do what we can do better and what we<br>can do differently but when I say that I<br>also believe very very strongly that<br>things aren't broken that there is so<br>much good in our education system there<br>are so many schools doing a wonderful<br>job you'll see some of those in the data<br>but you'll also see schools out there<br>who are just doing things well for our<br>young men and young women and what I do<br>want the point I do want to make to you<br>today as a practitioner of 40 years is<br>that young people are absolutely<br>wonderful they're on our side they want<br>to be with us as we make those<br>differences to their lives it's not a<br>problem that we need to start from<br>scratch is a problem that we need to do<br>like the repair shop does and take a<br>very chatty old chair and turn it into<br>something wonderful we can do that with<br>our education system as long as we all<br>work together and the need is in the<br>state system of Education in New Zealand<br>and the problem as in where the money is<br>brought<br>and where the money is put in education<br>this is my first tangent but my only one<br>is inter-ministry officials and where<br>the money isn't put us into the schools<br>and and that's my little moment of<br>having a political moment here in case<br>there's anybody who can make a<br>difference but how but the real question<br>is how can we turn it round how can we<br>turn around and it comes back I think to<br>the CH the question it's it is almost<br>rhetorical of what is the key purpose of<br>Education in a New Zealand Secondary<br>School in the 21st century post covert<br>what's our key purpose and there's a<br>pendulum in education it swings from one<br>side to the other and one at one side is<br>to prepare people for the workforce and<br>I'm sure many of you will think that<br>that's the right side that it should be<br>on at the other end of the pendulum it's<br>it's to prepare young people to become<br>good citizens<br>Hamilton voice High School we're on that<br>end of the pendulum we really are and<br>and there are many schools like Hamilton<br>Boise girl I'm not going to brag about<br>our school but but the young men that we<br>graduate are not young men who were<br>proud of as young men of 18 but that<br>we're proud of the fact that when<br>they're 40 they're going to be good<br>citizens and from that flows all of the<br>other needs that New Zealand's facing at<br>the moment from that from that flows<br>academic success the will to try the<br>will to attend school<br>because they've got that sense of<br>character character as a word that has<br>reduced in our language by 800 percent<br>over the last 10 years we don't say the<br>word character anymore and yet it's one<br>of the critical needs for us as<br>Educators to think about as our<br>responsibility in the years ahead as we<br>come through post covert as we enter a<br>different world I think the key question<br>for the New Zealand Educators<br>educational people who who make a<br>difference and Mr Bulger asked me at<br>lunchtime if you had power what would<br>you do and I said I think I'd look at<br>the good schools what do we need to look<br>at under the microscope are the good<br>schools the schools that are succeeding<br>I want to set it to<br>why are those schools succeeding if you<br>look at the data in Owen's booklet don't<br>look at the boys high one because he's<br>completely wrong on that one but the<br>other ones many of them are Catholic<br>schools why are Catholic schools<br>succeeding because the parents of those<br>young men come with a will for those<br>young men to succeed and see secondly<br>because they have a vision for character<br>and a good man and our vision at<br>Hamilton boys high school is to craft<br>good men<br>and that has to come before anything<br>else and when we realize that then I<br>think all of the other things will<br>definitely fall in pla into place I I<br>absolutely believe that I believe it<br>after 40 years of being involved I think<br>that there is a deficit model that's<br>very dangerous<br>if we keep talking about the below the<br>line realities we lose track of the<br>above the line Solutions and it's so<br>important that students don't buy into<br>the below the line deficit and start<br>believing in it I don't tell Boys At<br>boys high that boys in New Zealand are<br>underachieving by 12 when they're<br>compared to girls because that would<br>just make them think there was no hope<br>it would make them think that it was<br>okay to fail boys are wonderful at only<br>doing the limit that they have to do to<br>pass so if they get a merit they think<br>that was a bit of waste of energy<br>because they've done too much to just<br>surpass and they're wonderful in that<br>sense but we have to be very very aware<br>of how much they are hopeful and they<br>remain optimistic and they are the<br>people that are going to be leading this<br>country in 2050 and we have to get it<br>right and that's my one point this<br>afternoon I think to a group of people<br>who can make a change and make a<br>difference this is a one chance Post<br>cover to get it right we have to have<br>the courage the government has to have<br>the courage to say let's stop reset and<br>and re-look it and the two people who<br>are here with me this afternoon are both<br>absolutely correct as well but in the<br>end when other people ask me why is<br>Hamilton boys high school a successful<br>School while your young men are<br>successful assets because we love them<br>so much and they love us so much it's a<br>really really simple formula it's not<br>what I came here to talk about this<br>afternoon it's not even in my notes but<br>but it's all about the connection<br>with our young people and working with<br>them to make a difference thank you very<br>much<br>thank you very much<br>thanks very much to our speakers and our<br>may want to stick up for the men who are<br>chief who aim for more than a merit at<br>some stage is the only man sitting on<br>the stage at the moment you can you can<br>mention can I can I speak to you<br>straight away you can briefly one of the<br>most stunning moments of my whole<br>teaching career as a practitioner for 32<br>years and a principal for A.T<br>was sitting in a boys school not<br>Hamilton boys but in a boys school staff<br>room when the academic results were<br>being reviewed at the beginning of the<br>the year and the head of science stood<br>up and he said well you know our<br>academic results are ahead of the<br>national average and we're very proud of<br>them and and the students have done well<br>and the head of math stood up and and<br>said pretty much exactly the same thing<br>ahead of English stood up and<br>the heat of English was a woman and she<br>said well our results are behind the<br>national average but you must remember<br>we are teaching boys<br>I thought I was being punked my jaw<br>dropped open and I thought if I was down<br>the road at the matching girls school<br>and I said our science results are below<br>National leverage but you've got to<br>remember we're teaching girls I would<br>have been lynched uh and and that that<br>attitude it's not at Hamilton voice but<br>it is pervasive throughout our society<br>that boys don't read as much they don't<br>like reading you couldn't believe that<br>Tolkien and Lewis wrote great novels or<br>or all sorts of others I think we need<br>to have incredibly High aspirations for<br>hahaha<br>so what I'd like to do is ask some<br>questions we will take questions from<br>the floor shortly but we're just sorting<br>out some mic issues so I'm going to take<br>a few questions from slido but please do<br>sort out those<br>um uh those those questions that you'd<br>like to store up and ask us I'd like to<br>ask a question about future Focus I<br>think it's something that came through<br>in each of your preliminary comments or<br>your initial remarks<br>the question is what does future Focus<br>really mean<br>and then how can we achieve this in a<br>practical sense in education Rachel if<br>you just hold it a little higher the<br>receivers on the bottom of the mic so if<br>you hold it a bit higher<br>uh so look I'll start the day with given<br>it's my all my body of work<br>um over the last 25 years thinking about<br>the future and and actually it's<br>interesting because we do talk about<br>education as post-covered world I think<br>we have to talk about just this is the<br>normal world you know for those who<br>lived in in Tamaki Makoto or in tadafati<br>in Hawke's Bay right now covert has a<br>long past and they're thinking about the<br>more emergent climate issues our<br>students have dealt with more adversity<br>in the last few years some of them<br>haven't been to school for years and<br>have missed a critical time in their<br>schooling I think we really have to<br>understand the future fit means really<br>being able to be highly adaptable to<br>change and the change is just starting<br>and and for someone who trained as a<br>technologist and then moved into<br>education<br>the technology piece of it for me is<br>still underpins all of my research that<br>we we can't even imagine if you take a<br>business trip and you go into a<br>comparative business of similar size<br>offshore you'll probably see Automation<br>and technology that you can't even<br>imagine and actually if we want to be<br>playing on the global stage our students<br>need to be thinking about technology in<br>a in a completely different way not as a<br>kind of a core body of knowledge but as<br>a tool that is a necessity at any type<br>of role it doesn't matter if you're a<br>personal trainer a chef or you're going<br>into you know accountancy firm every one<br>of those sectors now all reliant on<br>multiple different platforms multiple<br>different types of Technologies and one<br>of the things that we see when we hire<br>graduates from University there's still<br>a sort of an idea that technology sits<br>as a side piece that it's only for<br>developers it's only people who do com<br>science when the reality is everything<br>sits on platforms most business are now<br>paperless and working digitally remotely<br>with workforces that are distributed and<br>so we start to think about what that<br>looks like going forward and our<br>students how do they stay motivated if<br>they're going into workforces where<br>they're going to only be connecting<br>potentially with clients customers<br>colleagues in a digital world and so we<br>have to build those skills and<br>capabilities so that they are core to<br>the understanding and there's still a<br>big divide between what we're learning<br>and teaching in the school environment<br>in the University environment and it's<br>really up to now the workforce and of<br>course it's a difficult when workforces<br>are always hitting the ground running to<br>take time out and bring people up to<br>that skill set so I would put a real<br>play into you know constantly putting<br>technology of our time at the Forefront<br>you know we're having all this debate I<br>cannot tell you how many conversations<br>I've had with media in the last few<br>weeks about chat GPT you know everyone's<br>suddenly jumping up and down you know if<br>I talk to the average I've got four<br>children have just gone through the<br>school system and the University student<br>system<br>they've been using AI for everything you<br>think of grammarly we've been using that<br>for years we use it across all of our<br>production of anything from videos to<br>audio to transcripts to language dubbing<br>you know creation of digital art these<br>things have been around for a long time<br>whole sectors have been massively<br>disrupted and so we just need to make<br>sure that we are thinking about the<br>types of jobs that are coming up because<br>it's not going to be technology it's not<br>going to be technology in its own sake<br>everything is technology enabled and<br>adjacent and so we have to understand<br>that's part of the kind of the<br>um just very briefly for the next five<br>years for a practical from a practical<br>stance for schools the curriculum<br>refresh should be completely thrown out<br>uh it will be a huge distraction for<br>schools they'll concentrate on that<br>rather than the children in front of<br>them the curriculum needs to be<br>simplified there is so much put into our<br>Curriculum by ideologues that is really<br>not relevant to children we want our<br>children to grow up free creative<br>informed thinkers not people who are<br>conforming to some nefarious group of<br>adults's view of the world I think<br>that's incredibly important and then the<br>second thing practically for schools I<br>think particularly<br>unless we change very strongly what's<br>happening in year 789 and 10 for<br>literacy and numeracy that the new<br>credits for literacy and numeracy that<br>you cannot get level one without will<br>have a massive impact on Lower<br>socioeconomic Maori and Pacifica<br>students that's not to say that the<br>credits aren't important but it's to say<br>we must change our teaching practice for<br>those four years leading up to it to<br>and that leads nicely on to my point<br>which is I think our Focus has to be<br>right in the center developing<br>resilience in our young people because<br>they've lived in a world for the last<br>three years where University entrance<br>has been much easier to get and and I'm<br>on the University Council here and you<br>see the results of that that come<br>students are coming in with the easier<br>UE and they're and they're finding it<br>much more difficult to finish their<br>first year at University so they we need<br>to expect our students to be well<br>educated by the time they leave that we<br>need to train them not to expect easy<br>options schools need to stop offering<br>soft UE subjects so that students can<br>get UE an easy way because you can I<br>could get a hundred percent of our<br>students through UE if I offered soft<br>subjects and we remain we remain<br>committed to to sustaining academic<br>focus in our classrooms and that needs<br>to happen we need to allow students to<br>fail more and we need to allow them to<br>learn from that failure and because<br>otherwise when they get into the real<br>world it's going to be a very very<br>frightening place for them and students<br>are very protected in our schools I<br>think and we have protected them through<br>covert it's been a very challenging time<br>but what we can learn from that is that<br>students can cope<br>you know they they can cope with with<br>sometimes not having life easy and and<br>they've been amazing through covert<br>they've they've Co they've just managed<br>very very well we our attendance<br>statistics didn't change at all through<br>covert really apart from those who had<br>covert and half of our school had covert<br>uh but but students just kept on wanting<br>to do the best they could but I think we<br>have as a whole society in New Zealand<br>moved away from developing that sense of<br>failure being a good thing and fairly<br>being a part of life and that's what we<br>need to focus on in the next five years<br>is have high expectations have high<br>expectations in our literacy and<br>University the fact that over half of<br>the students that did the literacy trial<br>failed uh is is something that is a<br>testament to the fact that we need to<br>expect more of our students right from<br>year seven onwards and don't get started<br>on what the primary school is doing<br>wrong because you know we always blame<br>the level below us our University is<br>blaming secondary schools too so it's<br>just exactly the same so so that is a<br>really important part of it thank you<br>and as Susan was talking there I was<br>thinking to a university course one of<br>my own daughters thought about taking<br>which was called learning to fail but<br>she dropped the course because it turned<br>out that the failure rate was really<br>hard really high in this paper and part<br>of the learning was to actually fail a<br>lot of these students<br>um so I was thinking about uh about that<br>um and we have to be very careful with<br>the sort of incentives and Arrangements<br>we set up there were so many Rich<br>threads that came through that<br>discussion including on technology and<br>Ai and of course in the University we're<br>fascinated by this and I can see<br>questions coming through there are<br>questions on broader policy settings and<br>so on but I am going to invite if<br>there's anyone who's got questions from<br>here again sorry<br>um I just wanted to if you were talking<br>about blaming the ones below you but<br>would you like to comment on the early<br>years being the most formative towards<br>the enthusiasm for curiosity and<br>exploration and Imagination creativity<br>and the global Trend towards drop and<br>run daycare if you wanted to comment on<br>them<br>um<br>these uh obviously in in New Zealand<br>Nathan Wallace and comet in Auckland and<br>others have been doing some wonderful<br>work about they they're calling it the<br>first Thousand Days uh I work a little<br>bit with Nathan and with Comet and<br>um I'm calling it project 5.75 that we<br>in New Zealand care for our as I said<br>before our unborn and our first five<br>years<br>um and and there are people like<br>um I forget his first name David<br>Eagleman from Stanford University<br>probably the world's best communicative<br>neuroscientist<br>and again this this is all well known<br>and we need to kind of get it out and<br>and pervasively into our community but<br>it moves on I I've been astounded at the<br>current government's response to what is<br>a crisis in attendance and Susan's right<br>there are some schools where it hasn't<br>dropped off at all<br>but but to have a select committee we<br>are only eight out of two and a half<br>thousand schools submitted on the basis<br>of no evidence at all because they<br>didn't go out into schools to find out<br>why why some schools children are<br>attending why some schools they aren't<br>they spent 84 million dollars uh they've<br>just spent another 74 on no further<br>Evidence uh just to put 80 truancy<br>officers out there and on no single<br>occasion have they mentioned teacher<br>quality and school quality and making it<br>really necessary that schools are<br>worthwhile coming to the best the<br>education Review Office would could do<br>was say make it a bit more fun<br>kids can have fun at home and that's<br>what they're doing and I was very<br>interested talking to a decile 10<br>student recently from a private school<br>in central Auckland and is it during<br>covert we worked out that we didn't need<br>many of our teachers we could do it<br>ourselves sitting around a coffee table<br>and and all of this sort of stuff and so<br>it's not just in the lower decile<br>schools so schools and I think you know<br>many of the ideas up here already this<br>afternoon schools need to become<br>worthwhile places by tapping into all of<br>the good things that are now available<br>and having incredibly High aspirations<br>Francis<br>I thank you for that question I think<br>it's a really interesting one because<br>when we think about in those early years<br>probably growing up and maybe if you've<br>got older children there is a huge<br>amount of active play you know there's a<br>real focus on activity collaboration<br>creativity and Innovation and there is a<br>downside of Technology as well that's<br>come in where it's very easy to give an<br>iPad to a child and to find some other<br>ways of entertaining and so I think<br>we've got studies that are coming<br>through right now where there is a<br>direct collation between the you know<br>the overuse in the very early years of<br>technology and instead of keeping that<br>focus on creativity and I would really<br>really call out Finland as an example of<br>you know one of the best education<br>systems in the world you don't start<br>school two or seven you stay with the<br>same teacher as a cohort and actually<br>the focus is really on outdoor play<br>indoor play and then that collaborative<br>piece I think there's a lot to learn but<br>we also have a country where you know<br>we've talked today about productivity<br>where people are dropping a daycare<br>because they have no other option it<br>really is a for many people the only way<br>you can get that support and so it comes<br>back to the first thousand days we know<br>is critical that they learn you know the<br>idea with words and and colors and form<br>and and so much of that comes from home<br>and as we distribute our families across<br>the world that gets harder so we have to<br>really seek it out and understand that<br>and so I think part of it is we're in an<br>early phase of knowing not knowing<br>enough about the effects I think we'll<br>know a lot more and we'll probably look<br>back at this time and wonder what we did<br>for some of this over overuse over<br>stimulation but I think also we do need<br>to kind of catch ourselves all of us<br>with our view across education because a<br>lot of the things we we hold on to we<br>know we forget the good things about the<br>past and we should bring some of those<br>through and we also forget to adopt the<br>good things in the future and so we need<br>that right across all parts of the<br>sector<br>you know I think if you turn that<br>question upside down it's really<br>important to retain that sense of awe<br>and wonder that our student our young<br>people have in those first thousand days<br>right through to the end of year 13 and<br>that's what uh it needs to be a goal<br>that our 18 year olds have the same<br>sense of awe and wonder that we should<br>be cultivating in young people right<br>from the start and that and we did that<br>then I think would be quite a different<br>Society quite a different world and<br>people would be so much happier and that<br>would bring all of the associated<br>benefits with it and let's not stop at<br>18 let's keep going we have to we have<br>to have the um these 18 year olds when<br>they move on to their next phase if<br>there's other questions in the room<br>University of Canterbury I first of all<br>would like to thank panelists for a very<br>stimulating discussion<br>but I would like to add and ask for it<br>for a comments I I hear a lot of about<br>technology<br>from the panelists but you know during<br>class 100 200 years each generation was<br>living in a time of a new new technology<br>Technologies<br>no more than another tool<br>and I would like to heard from the<br>panelists how the schools should address<br>the problems which young people face on<br>on a social social scene how schools<br>should build the attitudes so let's not<br>forget that<br>attitude builds the altitude<br>and<br>I have impression that you know<br>we all like to probably can agree here<br>that schools should teach how to remain<br>a learner for most of your life but how<br>the school should contribute to the<br>bills of attitudes which seems to be<br>missing in this discussion thank you<br>I'm sure season yes I I predicted the<br>microphone might go to you first<br>well I'd say it is a very important<br>question I think and everybody will<br>agree with me it's about educating<br>people to use the tools that we have<br>well just as have as we've been doing<br>since the stone ages really I mean we<br>just have different tools and they're<br>just as they're just as powerful if<br>we're talking about AI I have a fellow<br>Headmaster and another boys school who<br>uses um chat GPD GP GPT to writers<br>assembly talks now yes so so he thinks<br>it's wonderful so uh and and and we do<br>have to use that as a tool we need to<br>develop an understanding of how we can<br>use it as a tool but it comes back to<br>that sense of crafting good citizens I<br>mean I I will sound repetitive because I<br>think it's an important point that we<br>need to craft citizens who understand<br>how to use the tool of their age you<br>know and and we have to also understand<br>C.S Lewis's notion of chronological<br>snobbery that we all in our own age<br>think that our way is the best way but<br>sometimes we have to go back and we have<br>to look at at the best of the past and<br>and the best of the past was to create a<br>young man who had that sense of RTA of<br>being the best he could be in all<br>aspects of his life one of the aspects<br>is technology but there are all the<br>other things that matter so much uh as<br>well so it's about crafting from the age<br>of of two I have a two-year-old grandson<br>and he's only happy when he watches<br>Bluey which is a ghastly little cartoon<br>program that the rest of us can't stand<br>anymore because we see so much of it<br>what are we doing wrong we know we're<br>doing wrong but it's no different from<br>having one of those little things on a<br>crib that went round and round 25 30<br>years ago we're still doing it's all<br>about stimulus it's all about using the<br>tools that we have in a positive way and<br>in a measured way does that answer the<br>question I'll pass on to Alvin's I'll<br>pass on to Ellen so he can answer the<br>question I've got another question for<br>you Owen so if you don't want to answer<br>this one you can pass to Francis<br>I still like SpongeBob<br>um but one thing that we haven't mention<br>here is uh activity and uh sporting<br>activity physical activity every day for<br>children I do quite a lot of work with a<br>great New Zealander Rod Dixon it's 40<br>years since he won the New York Marathon<br>he's got a Kids Marathon program that we<br>put out into primary schools getting<br>kids out and and active every single day<br>competitive losing sometimes winning<br>sometimes I thought the English cricket<br>team is is you know keeping in mind I<br>made a lot of money off them I think<br>that their response to losing on Tuesday<br>was incredible<br>and you know that sort of character from<br>from physically competing is really<br>to the technology question in terms of<br>evolution of technology I think what we<br>need to be really mindful of is how fast<br>it's changing and I know it's easy to<br>say we've always have technological<br>advancement and we've gone through<br>different areas in Industrial Age and<br>moving into the digital age<br>I'll just use the example we've talked<br>about the gbt to get 100 million users<br>of a telephone the analog telephone that<br>said in our desk that we dialed took 75<br>years so from the time was first<br>invented we had to get lines and the<br>telephones and the technology and the<br>telephonus and the exchanges<br>to get to 100 million users on chat GPT<br>took 24 days<br>and of those hundred million 25 million<br>of it use it daily<br>now so this is how fast it's changing if<br>we think about something like Pokemon go<br>which was the very first mainstream AR<br>tool that came out a few years ago and<br>you may have had family members chasing<br>Pikachus around the neighborhood the<br>same thing happened it happened with an<br>immediate adoption because they already<br>had the phone or the iPad the technology<br>existed it was an overlay and I think<br>this is where the distribution of<br>technology is so fast so just this uh<br>just this week has come out that now we<br>have 3.4 devices per person on the<br>planet<br>you so just a few years ago it was less<br>than one and so at the speed of which<br>the internet is is now uh overtaking<br>what we can possibly do the advances are<br>going to be incredibly rapid we cannot<br>pretend that this stuff is not happening<br>out there the advances and the cognitive<br>advances as we support ourselves with<br>technology will change the future of our<br>workplaces and our jobs and our careers<br>and if we start looking today if what I<br>say with my graduate schools we we have<br>professionals who study with us we say<br>look at your job and now go to the<br>Silicon Valley work website<br>and find the same title and see if you<br>could do that look at the job<br>description and if you could do that job<br>and everyone gets horrified because they<br>realize what they're asking for for the<br>same role in a more advanced economy is<br>fundamentally different we have to look<br>at other countries we have to understand<br>the speed of which this is going to<br>change the way we we operate as a<br>country if we're going to stay globally<br>competitive<br>thanks Francis I'm going to ask a<br>question from slido but do keep waving<br>out if you've got questions from the<br>floor oh and I'll start with you on this<br>one and The Others May like to add to it<br>how can we best serve the needs of a<br>wide range of children including gifted<br>and neurodiverse<br>children I think this is something you<br>had an interest in well my Master's<br>Degree was in teaching gifted and<br>talented children and I've thrown most<br>of that theory out<br>for a whole range of very good reasons<br>but the main one being that first of all<br>two main ones first of all if you label<br>five percent of your population or<br>School population has been gifted you're<br>labeling 95 has been non-gifted and I<br>don't think that's acceptable and then<br>the second part of it is that there is<br>no longer a strongly held view that<br>human ability is a fixed construct in<br>fact when children come into the two<br>schools at South and West Auckland that<br>helped establish and we did Esther tests<br>and we would find an average they were<br>two years behind I would insist to my<br>staff members that they regard that<br>period of time that they need to catch<br>up that they would regard that they're<br>behind because of environmental reasons<br>not because of internal ability reasons<br>the second thing I mean neurodiverse<br>Learners I I just love us those<br>anecdotes I mean I remember having<br>another meeting and we were at that<br>stage building character and so we were<br>talking to the students about what they<br>do for their parents and I said to them<br>in the meeting<br>this morning Monday morning anyone put<br>your hand up what did you do for your<br>parents on the weekend that was just<br>fantastic and an 11 year old girl put a<br>hand up Millie and she said I let my mom<br>go out cougaring on Saturday night<br>and we all just looked and I said okay<br>end of the meeting off to class but one<br>of the neat things in that school<br>environment was it wasn't one rule for<br>all each person was seen individually<br>and sometimes in a classroom there needs<br>to be a different rule for a child who<br>sees the world in a different way and<br>one of the great disappointments from a<br>from a straight professional perspective<br>over three years we asked the labor<br>government to allow us to establish a<br>480 student school near a transport Hub<br>in central Auckland for neurodiverse<br>Learners as a designated character<br>school and the Ministry of Education say<br>no and then try and work out the reasons<br>why and it's simply not acceptable and<br>those children need that kind of service<br>Susan<br>if to season for a question please<br>what's the role of vocational success<br>alongside academic success<br>of vocational well they're they're<br>equally important there are so many<br>types of success which are important uh<br>I'm not sure what the question really<br>means other than for me to say that it's<br>so obvious that they are uh there used<br>to be a system you know we those of us<br>have been around a long time remember<br>the vocational schools vocational<br>Pathways schools and now schools are<br>expected to be all things to all people<br>and so it is a very real challenge for<br>us we we have students at Hamilton boys<br>high school doing level three music up<br>here at University and we have students<br>who are really working very very hard<br>over four years to get level one through<br>a vocational pathway so it's the<br>diversity of our Learners that really is<br>a key part of what we have to do and<br>we're setting our goals establishing our<br>goals vocational pathways are a key<br>aspect of ensuring that all students can<br>have success because that is their area<br>of strength first 15 rugby is an area<br>which is a vocational pathway now so the<br>whole notion of vocational Pathways has<br>changed over the years because people<br>can make their careers in such a wide<br>spectrum of ways from a young man who's<br>finishing his level three music at<br>University because he did his letters<br>when he was in the united to a young man<br>who's going to work very very hard to<br>have the skills to be able to work on<br>the roads when he leaves school when<br>he's 17. the other thing about secondary<br>schools is that they used to be like a<br>triangle when I was at school you know<br>year 13 was a small group and now<br>they're a rectangle students are staying<br>at school longer the needs of our<br>students are changing and and I come<br>back to my point at the very beginning<br>that crafting good citizens is what it's<br>all about and and ensuring that that<br>they can have a meaningful pathway all<br>the way through there are some wonderful<br>programs to run by the ministry Gateway<br>trades academies they're too small<br>they're underfunded everything is<br>underfunded and and that's the tragedy<br>for these young women and young men we<br>we've got 80 people on a Gateway program<br>we could have 150 we have a roll of 2<br>300 and and could easily be 200 150 to<br>200 young men in those programs but we<br>get what we're funded to get and that's<br>the end and that's in that c and we use<br>some of our international student<br>funding uh to ensure that more young men<br>who need vocational Pathways get them uh<br>the covert has shown so dramatically<br>that schools cannot exist without<br>International students and that's<br>another aspect of the underfunding which<br>is which is really quote frightening for<br>us and we're looking in those Futures<br>because the needs as Owen says you know<br>it's not just your neurodiverse it's<br>just the broad range of young people's<br>needs that we do need to meet and the<br>future and when I talk about stepping<br>back and resetting what education is all<br>about then that's what those are the<br>things we need to consider of what's the<br>best way in which we as a very small<br>country can work it out so that we're<br>doing the very best we can for all of<br>those diversities thank you thank you<br>we're almost out of time well I'm going<br>to ask one very brief question that<br>you're allowed 10 seconds to respond to<br>if money were no problem<br>what would you do different season do<br>you want to start with that one just a<br>you just talked about money in your last<br>uh yeah if money was no problem I'd<br>probably sack half of the people in<br>Ministry uh and and divert that so there<br>was even more money in schools uh if<br>money was was no problem I think we<br>would need to<br>um<br>really really look at the good schools<br>we would have the courage to get rid of<br>some of the schools that are really<br>struggling we would educate school<br>principals in genuine leadership and we<br>would<br>Pay Teachers what they deserve to be<br>paid so that we would get a stronger<br>teaching Workforce and if we had a<br>stronger teaching Workforce we'd have a<br>stronger economy and it's as simple as<br>that in the end teachers work very very<br>hard whatever you may think about us<br>that we get 14 weeks holiday year that<br>we go home at 3 15. as it is genuinely<br>not true teachers were very very hard<br>and and they deserve to be paid a living<br>wage and that's the trouble when you've<br>got first year teachers still earning 56<br>000 and they've taken four or five years<br>to get their degree it's not good enough<br>thanks thanks Susan and Owen you can see<br>Susan's got a bit of a shopping list<br>there including some things she'd get<br>rid of but a brief uh what would you do<br>money's No Object 10 seconds because<br>we're over time I'm prepared to become<br>the secretary for Education uh I'm a man<br>of simple taste so I'll save the<br>education system uh 284 000 by doing it<br>at half the price uh of the current<br>employee<br>um and let's start<br>and I would make sure that all policy<br>makers are really well informed about<br>the big shifts that are happening in the<br>world starting with the demographics<br>here and what the impact will be into<br>the future<br>thank you very much well you know we've<br>had wonderful presentations from Francis<br>from Owen and from Susan a hugely Rich<br>insights during the discussion that<br>followed so thanks very much to our<br>panelists for uh wonderful presentations<br>and with that we're going to be moving<br>to a break uh we've got a break from uh<br>till 3 P.M so we can be back at 3 P.M<br>we've got a great session coming up at<br>three<br>nice<br>morning<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>thank you<br>afternoon everyone I sorry<br>don't mean to startle you but um<br>we'd like to get a start on this next<br>session we've got a a couple of really<br>fantastic sessions coming up here we are<br>allowed to go we want to get the full<br>time for each of these sessions so we<br>will go just slightly later than than in<br>the program so hopefully that will be<br>okay with um with people<br>um hope you had some good coffee there<br>was so much discussion before before the<br>break I'm sure your brains were feeling<br>quite um full after all of that<br>information and thought processing but<br>where we're moving to now is is public<br>sector and of course a robust and<br>well-functioning public sector is<br>something that often we don't notice it<br>when things are going well and I think<br>um it's when things go wrong that we<br>really notice the importance of this<br>robust<br>um and um transparent public sector so<br>this session is going to be taking a<br>look at the public sector in New Zealand<br>including the extent to which we are<br>still world class<br>we've got three great panelists who all<br>know each other and and have been having<br>lots of conversations so we'll direct<br>those conversations to our our audience<br>now our first panelists will be sir<br>Martin Weaver's delighted to have him<br>along uh here former New Zealand<br>Diplomat and Senior public servant<br>bringing a wealth of experience from<br>those roles then we have Graham Scott<br>former secretary to the treasury former<br>New Zealand productivity commissioner<br>and antoli a commissioner for Tauranga<br>city council former MP and government<br>minister so all names that are known<br>quite well to many of us so with that<br>please<br>thank you Anna kyotato<br>um great pleasure to be here and to<br>share the platform with Graham and Anne<br>um I found it all a bit depressing so<br>far so when I mentioned that uh to Anna<br>she said are you going to liven it up<br>and make it more positive I said well no<br>but you know when lots of problems are<br>put in front of you you know the the<br>natural solutions to say well the<br>natural question is to say well how can<br>these be fixed and that's a really<br>really good uh question to ask<br>um<br>the session is a robust public sector<br>are we still world class<br>the inference that it seems to me we're<br>being invited to draw of course at some<br>stage in the past we did have a<br>world-class public sector<br>um I don't think personally I don't know<br>what the other thing that that was ever<br>true uh certainly not across the board<br>but there were certain periods in our<br>past and I was just saying to the Graeme<br>if you go back to the 1890s with uh<br>labor market and then uh<br>1930s with welfare state there were<br>areas where New Zealand was really<br>innovative<br>and earned a reputation and delivered on<br>significant social or economic reforms<br>that then were emulated and have been<br>vetted in and have been very successful<br>the question is are we still in that<br>sort of space or not<br>what I'd like to say is it's quite<br>important here to distinguish between<br>our Democratic systems and our Public<br>public sector although they're closely<br>linked because it's certainly true uh<br>that in New Zealand we enjoy one of the<br>most stable and long-standing open uh<br>and unchallenged democracies globally<br>and that's something to be really really<br>uh grateful for our national<br>institutions are broadly stable they run<br>by the rule of law we have an<br>independent Judiciary by and large we<br>have a very trusted police force which<br>is true in very few places in the world<br>and we have regular and uninterrupted<br>and peaceful transfers of democratic<br>power so you know a lot of people would<br>give everything to get that sort of<br>package if they could<br>and some areas we work<br>very well I think of the office of the<br>auditor general which is a very robust<br>and long-standing office<br>um<br>and as chair I think of Transparency<br>International New Zealand I think this<br>year we're second in the world we have<br>been first for a number of years that's<br>independently done and there are a<br>number of other measures like that about<br>trust in government and government<br>institutions a very high compared<br>internationally and it's also true that<br>apparently a lot of the democracies at<br>the moment are under pressure and Trust<br>in government has diminished quite<br>sharply uh over the covert period around<br>democracies uh I think it's probably a<br>little too early to say what the score<br>is with trust and government in New<br>Zealand because the data is probably not<br>out but certainly there are a lot of<br>positives in our system<br>but it seems to me that the organizers<br>imposing this question<br>um<br>suggest that they're worried about the<br>nature and the quality of advice uh<br>that's going from officials of which<br>Graham and I were both long-standing<br>officials<br>um giving to ministers and in cabinet<br>processes or perhaps the nature and the<br>quality and the direction of decisions<br>being taken by ministers and the<br>executive or agency Chief Executives of<br>the boards of state-owned Enterprise or<br>crown entities I think it's really<br>important also to distinguish between<br>the robust institutions I've talked<br>about which I think are you know they're<br>by and large good they can all be<br>improved with the board level or you<br>know you have ministers who are better<br>than others and chief executives are<br>better than others and all that sort of<br>stuff but taking that all out the worst<br>the systems operate reasonably strongly<br>um but the question is<br>um<br>what can we do to improve that and how<br>do you do that now that the peak bodies<br>for dealing with our public sector uh uh<br>and guiding it of course uh the National<br>Institution of is the National<br>Institution of the parliament and from<br>the parliament<br>um the team that becomes the cabinet<br>because they enjoy the confidence of the<br>house they are charged with trying to<br>coordinate all of the aspects of the<br>State uh in this country which is the<br>broad term of the public sector so and<br>that's literally hundreds of<br>organizations I mean we all know we've<br>got two and a half thousand secondary<br>schools or schools but there are<br>organizations Ministries departments<br>departmental agencies<br>a range of diverse service providers<br>locally we've got local government of<br>course we've got Regulatory Agencies<br>and essential Democratic and judicial<br>institutions<br>finding alignment cohesion and as<br>current solar Forest Secretary of the<br>Ministry of Education used to say her<br>job in the education department<br>is to keep the herd moving roughly West<br>and I always rather like that expression<br>because it's not quite like herding cats<br>but it's not far off it and that's<br>really I'm sure the role that Jim Bulger<br>and others of his colleagues had when<br>they were sitting at the cabinet table<br>this is a beer moth and it's really<br>quite difficult and extremely daunting<br>to work out what to address and when so<br>it seems to me from the time that I've<br>spent working<br>just over 10 years in the Beehive and<br>seeing and Advising ministers and prime<br>ministers at very close quarters<br>um<br>and as Graham I'm sure will attest that<br>focusing on some key planks and doing<br>them well and consistently over years<br>really paid dividends<br>the taxation reforms of the 80s<br>the state-owned Enterprise reforms uh<br>the whole liberation of Agriculture from<br>the regular regulations that they had to<br>make them<br>um you know responsive and live on their<br>own wits and with Africa very important<br>and improved part of our economic life<br>and that really devolved from a decision<br>strategically to look at agriculture<br>completely differently so those sorts of<br>big things are big multiplier so<br>thinking of a conversation we've had<br>today if somehow through the agencies<br>that have responsibility for the<br>education system the immigration system<br>and the fiscal system which of<br>conversations that have come up already<br>today if we could get those humming a<br>lot of other things would fall into<br>place naturally so the challenge for uh<br>the the leaders in the public sector<br>which are essentially the cabinet<br>uh how to work out which of those issues<br>to pick and what advice they should<br>receive and then what decisions they<br>should make and there's a big difference<br>between provision of policy advice which<br>was our domain and making the decisions<br>which were the domain that Jim and Anne<br>were in and they often get conflated in<br>the public mind<br>um<br>I'd make the point that the way in which<br>the Westminster system operates in New<br>Zealand I think it's it's now quite<br>different from the way it originally<br>started in the UK and certainly the way<br>it runs now<br>um so Jim bulge will be horrified at the<br>way they run the British cabinet system<br>um and as we saw the Prime Minister of<br>Australia recently in secret appointed<br>himself to several portfolios without<br>telling anybody I don't know how the<br>cabinet secretary there could sleep at<br>night or any others and the Canadians<br>have a very strange view of the way<br>these things run so it's pretty tight<br>the New Zealand cabinet runs with only<br>cabinet ministers in the in the room<br>um when this meeting in full<br>with one official who was somebody who<br>worked in the department I used to hit<br>the cabinet secretary and that's there<br>to act as a sort of a as a corporate<br>secretary for the process<br>um but it's politicians alone who are<br>making the decisions that's quite<br>unusual in the Westminster system<br>bringing officials into those<br>conversations all the time changes the<br>dynamic and changes the responsibility<br>for taking these tough calls that's a<br>great strength in our system but the<br>issues are hard<br>it's not an easy job in fact it's an<br>extremely difficult job being the Prime<br>Minister even of this country most of<br>the issues that we have are the same<br>that bigger countries with bigger<br>resources uh also have to Grapple with<br>we don't have the military heft or the<br>economic heft or the scientific heft<br>that others have because of our scale<br>and we have wonderful attributes because<br>of the place we live in but they're also<br>as we know things from the turinive<br>distance so the challenges are real and<br>they Bubble Up and then things happen<br>like Cyclones like earthquakes like<br>recessions and those they all put<br>pressure on the institutions and they<br>divert the public sector from what they<br>thought was their day job into<br>responding to a to a crisis so uh in<br>terms of are we still world class as<br>I've said I don't think we ever were<br>across the system there are some areas<br>where we did really well but then we go<br>off the boil of it so it's time to get<br>things back on the boil the questions<br>would be which<br>um<br>for my mind I think there's been a lack<br>of a reduction of focus<br>um I think the the butter has been<br>spread too thinly that there's been a<br>lack of focus on the things that really<br>matter the ones that would have big<br>multiplier effects and I think again<br>education immigration are two that have<br>already come up today<br>um I think there's a lack of urgency<br>uh<br>in the way in which a lot of the public<br>sector agencies uh respond to changes of<br>circumstances uh I was<br>I was at dpmc when we had the Canterbury<br>earthquake so I was leading the<br>emergency response from The Beehive<br>Banker literally for days on end and<br>hearing<br>um Rob talked today about the um the<br>inability or the growing inability of<br>the health system to listen to and<br>respond to offers<br>which were well-grounded of enormous<br>Goodwill from the community and the<br>business Community to try and help with<br>the covert response I found deeply<br>disheartening<br>I think there's a general issue<br>that openness to external voices<br>is not as strong as it should be<br>um in the system that is providing<br>advice and that can be improved I think<br>we have far too many uh portfolios<br>far too many public service<br>organizations in the in the state sector<br>I think in the local government area we<br>still have too many small councils<br>numerous councils with only ten thousand<br>rate payers and critical mass is really<br>lacking there is of course a legitimate<br>political economy discussion about the<br>level of representation<br>between<br>over centralization in one hand and too<br>many small entities on the other and<br>that's that's a really difficult thing<br>but I remember the time before the 1986<br>I think it was local government reforms<br>when we had 300 local councils in New<br>Zealand I Come From The Wider upper<br>there were separate councils for<br>greytown for martinborough for<br>featherston and for masterton<br>um now they're down to three but it's<br>only one down and they should probably<br>only have one so we're not as bad as we<br>used to be but we certainly have great<br>scope for improving further so<br>um I think I'd just leave it there there<br>were a lot of things that um came to<br>mind in those discussions uh the role in<br>the public sector offered us to deal<br>with a strange combinations of I would<br>say mundane but I don't want to devalue<br>them regular day-to-day Services which<br>support the lives of citizens whether<br>it's about paying taxes<br>or providing uh regular services for<br>everything that everybody does all the<br>time including infrastructure<br>electricity all that sort of stuff<br>things that we just expect to happen and<br>generally in this country they do happen<br>um then there are all the pressures for<br>when there are crises and I think we've<br>seen again in Hawke's Bay and certainly<br>in Canterbury and in other occasions<br>when this community still does have a<br>lot of social capital and it can pull<br>together and then we see a lot of people<br>who are employed in the public sector at<br>local or Central level<br>um going well above and beyond and<br>delivering to their communities as we<br>all expect them to do and that's<br>something for which we're all eternally<br>grateful<br>but making sure that those entities are<br>designed appropriately and resourced<br>appropriately to handle both the regular<br>stuff and continuous Improvement and new<br>technology and all that sort of stuff<br>and being ready for Ben the big wave<br>comes across which is normally<br>unexpected it doesn't happen where you<br>think<br>um it's a really tricky balance and of<br>course the whole thing which I haven't<br>even mentioned comes with cost and then<br>the really big question about value for<br>money and I think there's a real<br>question to be asked now about how much<br>value are we getting for<br>a lot of the services that are being<br>undertaken in our name<br>where does the balance lie between<br>policy advised the crown entities the<br>ministers and how proposals for<br>improvement are made and how decisions<br>are taken I mean we could have several<br>more sessions on that but it's not easy<br>to leave with that rhetorical and we'll<br>pass that over let's pass it over to<br>Graeme and see how um see how Graham<br>comes up with Solutions yeah well look<br>thank you I agree with Martin that<br>there's a lot to be pleased about with<br>the New Zealand public sector by<br>comparison with its peers but frankly<br>that's not saying much these days<br>um it's a there's there is a lot and you<br>can see a recitation of this and the<br>work that the Public Service Commission<br>published in December which recites a<br>lot of positive things about the public<br>service but this topic sets a higher bar<br>than that are we world-class and I would<br>agree with Martin that we have been in<br>some places at some times which means<br>are we there today and the places we<br>ought to be and I'll resist the<br>temptation to make wild generalizations<br>because I only look at the public sector<br>from the outside these days so talk<br>about three things I know something<br>about and see if there is a<br>generalization from that well my three<br>topics are policy capability fiscal<br>institutions and the use of data<br>on policy capability I suggest we lack<br>deep continuing and productive policy<br>analysis on some of the major problems<br>that New Zealand faces<br>there's a risk of group think which I<br>see some of around the public service<br>there seems to be a lack of creative<br>tension people are so busy being polite<br>to each other they don't argue much<br>anymore it seems whereas the public<br>service I remember was actually a pretty<br>hard school and that had its downsides<br>but you didn't go into a meeting if you<br>hadn't done your homework or if you did<br>you didn't say anything<br>there's been a loss of a kind of<br>skepticism something I loved about the<br>old public sector was there was a bit of<br>a sort of prison camp ethic you all were<br>out trying to persuade politicians to do<br>you what you thought the right thing<br>you'd come back with half marks and get<br>together and have a bit of a session<br>with your with your friends in the<br>department and and say things that you<br>would never say in front of ministers to<br>get it off your chest<br>and I sort of missed that I wonder if<br>there is this sort of sense there any<br>longer besides the missing or inadequate<br>policy advice that it can see there's a<br>lack of careful institution analysis<br>about how to deliver Services which has<br>been crippling for the present<br>government in my view because there's a<br>natural bias in the central government<br>towards centralization it's in the<br>incentives some people say that's<br>politicization for me as an economist I<br>say well if people are employed by the<br>public sector and they're working for<br>ministers who are ambitious to improve<br>their careers and so on there's a<br>tendency for this whole thing to get<br>bigger and bigger because every solution<br>looks like another opportunity to<br>accrete something which is exactly what<br>you've heard<br>for Martin<br>I think the centralization has gone far<br>too far in education and in the public<br>service as well and is damaging some<br>very successful collaborations and<br>health and the Curious Thing in the the<br>health reform is being done with a thick<br>rhetoric about empowerment of local<br>people empowering local voice and so on<br>but when you stand back and look at it<br>it's a gigantic Crown entity with<br>something like 82 000 employees probably<br>the biggest sort of organization in that<br>sense in in New Zealand and working with<br>the Capital District Council to try and<br>put together a locality Health Network<br>you find you're talking to somebody on<br>the fourth working for the fourth level<br>of management inside this giant and the<br>answer is don't um don't call us we'll<br>call you we're not ready to talk to you<br>yet so there's a there's a kind of I<br>think non-cognitive dissonance in there<br>about working with communities<br>supporting people but when it gets to<br>the Practical reality there's still a<br>lot of traditional bureaucratic behavior<br>and you shouldn't expect the big<br>bureaucracy to behave as if it's not so<br>in some ways talking about agile<br>bureaucracies is an oxymoron<br>there's a mistrust of sector specialists<br>in the culture today I don't know how<br>widespread it is but it seems to me that<br>the engineers got kicked out of planning<br>years ago and they should come back when<br>I listened to a really difficult debates<br>about monetary policy today it troubles<br>me that if you want to make a have an<br>opinion on monetary policy which is well<br>founded you'd better have studied<br>monetary Theory at graduate level worked<br>in the area for a few years and maybe<br>done some research it's the same with<br>the regulation of a lot of Industries<br>this isn't for amateurs you've got to be<br>good at this stuff or you make really<br>damaging mistakes so I wonder if there's<br>been a downgrading of of technical skill<br>almost 10 years ago the department of<br>prime minister and cabinet started a<br>framework for training public policy<br>analysts which is world class and is<br>used in other countries and is mentioned<br>in the Public Services Commission report<br>but my sense overall is that it's uh<br>it's lying in the shadow a bit these<br>days it's a brilliant tool it needs to<br>be resuscitated and used much more<br>aggressively than it is secondly on<br>fiscal institutions and what I mean by<br>that are the rules of the game the<br>practices the culture the flows of data<br>the decision rights that sit in the<br>fiscal system not the particular<br>decisions the New Zealand financial<br>reporting system is still the best in<br>the world because it's the most<br>integrated in the world and it's<br>something to be very pleased about but I<br>think there's been a steady erosion of<br>the teeth it once had so we're now at a<br>point where you've got government<br>agencies with multi-category multi-year<br>Appropriations in other words it's a<br>bucket of money money and how you work<br>out what that's been spent on and what<br>you've got for it can be a problem<br>the government largely ignored the<br>requirements and the Public Finance act<br>for fiscal responsibility when covert<br>hit and I can understand that and<br>practical sense God knows it must have<br>been awful being on the treasure at that<br>time but these Clauses were simply<br>ignored and they need to be worked on<br>further to bring them back to a sense of<br>bipartisan agreement and have the<br>parliament taking them seriously which<br>it's not been doing<br>the troubles to me that the long-term<br>fiscal Outlook which Jim Bulger talked<br>about earlier we've been looking at that<br>demographic fiscal bomb since the mid<br>90s and we still don't have a coherent<br>and well put together framework for what<br>options you might use to to do something<br>about it<br>I think while the cost-benefit analysis<br>systems and the treasury have been tuned<br>up by the living standards framework<br>I've got to say I'm skeptical of the<br>value of large dashboards covered in<br>well-being indications when I don't know<br>what you do with them to make decisions<br>and a report from Simon Upton<br>parliamentary commissioner for the<br>environment recently is quite blistering<br>in that regard and says MPS can't see<br>any longer what they spent money on and<br>what they got for it and I think it's<br>it's high time to have a good look and<br>see if all of that's producing what you<br>wanted<br>I'm also troubled at Monetary and fiscal<br>policy has got blurred again with the<br>consequence that the Reserve Bank lost<br>nine billion dollars over the covert<br>monetary policy and people of my age<br>remember that the reason we separated in<br>the first place was of course the Robert<br>Muldoon got the Reserve Bank to lose an<br>amount of money which would be several<br>billion today intervening in the foreign<br>exchange markets and so I think that's a<br>mistake that's been made that needs<br>sorting out look there's a lot more to<br>be said about that but that's my second<br>thing let's tune up the fiscal<br>institutions finally on data<br>I don't think the public sector is on<br>the frontiers of data science in areas<br>I'm familiar with and there's a lot of<br>lot that can be done particularly if a<br>social investment comes back in as a<br>government policy there's a lot that can<br>be used there people are obviously aware<br>that the so-called web 3.0 wave of<br>Innovations is hitting all over the<br>world at the moment it'll be 10 years<br>for it to mature but for us to take<br>advantage of this there are four things<br>that have to happen data sovereignty<br>data standards data interoperability and<br>trusted storage now if these<br>developments can take place and we're<br>doing some things with them but if they<br>pushed much harder then I would hope<br>would get an explosion of impact<br>investment doing all sorts of innovative<br>things and social policy Environmental<br>Policy regenerative agriculture and so<br>on which simply can't happen at the<br>moment without free-flowing data running<br>across the system and I think the public<br>sector has to get used to the idea that<br>it won't be in control of all of this it<br>would be a player in it that will no<br>longer run it the IDI will be coming a<br>smaller portion of the total so let me<br>let me leave it there if there's a theme<br>for me it's that we've got too many<br>centralized Solutions and that we lack<br>real skill in the institutional analysis<br>which is very painstaking work to be<br>able to unpack these Delivery Systems<br>and make the best use of modern data<br>however accurate<br>and good afternoon everyone look I've<br>worked in the public sector in both<br>local and central government for more<br>years than I care to remember so that's<br>where I'm going to focus today<br>and my first question on the comment on<br>the question is<br>have we ever been world class and in my<br>view the answer is no in many respects I<br>think we're probably going backwards<br>uh so I think our public sector is<br>justifiably held in high regard as<br>Martin<br>referred to I am chair of Transparency<br>International and for probity and<br>transparency we are world class<br>uh I do have some doubts about the<br>growing power of the executive but<br>that's another topic for another day<br>but if if if we're talking about making<br>a judgment and our overall standing in<br>the world we have to base that on the<br>results the outcomes that we achieve and<br>I think that they're all too often we've<br>we fall very short of world class<br>the relationship between local<br>government and central government is<br>fraught with conflict and frustration<br>and there's a huge disconnect between<br>governance policy and implementation<br>responsibilities which causes that<br>conflict and endless processes talk<br>about bureaucracy that's where it is at<br>its best<br>public sector has a focus a huge focus<br>on planning which is appropriate it's<br>something we do have to we do need to do<br>but it all seems to Fall to Pieces when<br>it comes to the delivery<br>the source of ongoing frustration is the<br>lack of joined up decision making<br>between government departments and<br>ministers have to take responsibility<br>for that and between our 78 authorities<br>territorial Authority authorities<br>particularly as it refers to<br>infrastructure funding and delivery<br>and the funding is often available lots<br>of it but it sometimes feels like the<br>various Government funding pots<br>available are designed more to apply oil<br>to the squeaky wheel or as has already<br>been referred to announcements by<br>ministers then to ensure sound Urban<br>growth economic growth and prosperity<br>and system-wide infrastructure<br>and the result is that on local<br>government we have parts of funding<br>Stacks required to make any sort of<br>progress but not in the time frame that<br>we need it and with contributions that<br>are contingent on funding agreements<br>from other arms of government and the<br>example of that I would give is<br>wakakotahi who it's a hypothecated fund<br>so it only ever confirmed what it can<br>afford not what is needed<br>it can only commit to funding for three<br>years and yet local government is<br>required to do infrastructure planning<br>um and financial planning over 10 years<br>and those two are not even aligned so<br>that when local government comes to do<br>its 10-year plan that knows what the<br>three-year funding commitment from<br>wakakote is how on Earth can you plan<br>infrastructure with that sort of that's<br>where the conflict and the frustration<br>comes however I have to say that in a<br>crisis somehow we managed to pull it all<br>together<br>um and all the crown agencies come to<br>the table with their dollars we get Tang<br>at a fenua sitting at the table often<br>with their dollars and we get local<br>governments sitting there with their<br>dollars and the examples of that um are<br>all too recent so if you look at what<br>happened in Christchurch following the<br>earthquake we got thousands of hectares<br>of land opened up for building<br>and yet you try and do that today you're<br>talking a 10-year process that might end<br>up in the courts<br>we got the crown commissing two major<br>infrastructure building in the CBD in<br>order to give confidence to the private<br>sector to reinvest<br>and then if you look at that magnificent<br>kaikodo to Christchurch Highway that was<br>built following the kaikoura earthquakes<br>built in half the time<br>on budget<br>planned in a tenth of the time that it<br>takes nowadays to get a highway<br>what we have is magnificent that is<br>truly world class we have amenity values<br>for both commute commuters and and for<br>visitors we have<br>a good environmental outcomes and we had<br>manafinoa co-design that is looking at<br>world-class public service<br>so I'm absolutely positive when we look<br>at uh Cyclone ravaged areas like<br>titafati and Hawke's Bay that the<br>dollars on the table and the clear<br>expectations as to what is what is to be<br>achieved I have no doubt that they'll<br>that that will all work my question is<br>why can't it always be like that because<br>that would certainly be world-class<br>well thank you very much to our<br>panelists for um really getting us to<br>think through these issues and Link them<br>back to a lot of the discussions that<br>have been going on earlier<br>um this morning and the encouragement<br>also to have very Frank conversations I<br>think we should take on on board<br>um if there are questions from the floor<br>please do wave out and we'll get a<br>microphone over to um you otherwise um I<br>think I'm going to make a start on on<br>um<br>on a question you know you all made this<br>comment that where we may be maybe maybe<br>used to be world-class or maybe our<br>world class in some areas but there are<br>certainly other areas where we're far<br>from world class<br>how would we go about getting world<br>class would we look to other countries<br>are there particular other countries<br>that we would look to where would we<br>look to to inform this moving towards<br>it's actually for all of you so you may<br>decide who look in in the areas that I<br>um spoke about<br>it's clear that the outer edges of the<br>dark use of data is in the United States<br>they're so far it I mean the fact that<br>there's all sorts of bad things going on<br>there as well there's also a lot of very<br>good things and I'm presently working<br>for one of the blockchain foundations in<br>the United States I'm just astonished<br>really at the skills that are in the<br>generation of new zealanders who have<br>all these contacts deep into Silicon<br>Valley and so on what they're able to<br>bring here<br>but they're all frustrated that they<br>they can't get things done I mean take<br>something really simple like the<br>anti-money laundering requirements if<br>you're going to launch what they call a<br>digital autonomous organization which<br>muddles up the role of being a<br>shareholder or director or a manager of<br>course our regulatory systems are all<br>based on the idea it's a company with a<br>shareholder and directors here somebody<br>to hold accountable well with a digital<br>autonomous organization that's all a<br>blur<br>and so you know what we're trying to<br>work on is how would you have a<br>regulatory system because these things<br>are Financial products you're asking<br>people to put money in how do you adapt<br>the regulatory system to allow this to<br>happen and I think as I mentioned<br>earlier this could release a huge amount<br>of energy to get this right but where is<br>the energy that's around saying well<br>Helen let's think about how we do<br>regulate these kinds of things so<br>actually getting funded from another<br>I think um<br>we could look<br>very closely at experience of our own<br>communities it's not all offshore<br>but there is stuff offshore I mean<br>um<br>my my son is working in the energy<br>sector in the UK he says that lovely<br>there are things they'd love to do with<br>their energy firm in New Zealand but the<br>regulatory environment simply doesn't<br>permit it and that this wonderful<br>organization here is filled with<br>ambitious people who are making their<br>lives offshore at the moment a lot of<br>people want to come home or might may<br>want to assist in some way<br>um I think part of that is just opening<br>up some of those windows that Rob was<br>talking about before to the private<br>sector and others expatriates or new new<br>migrants I mean you know the great thing<br>about a a liberal and open democracy<br>with open Information Systems is that<br>all voices can be heard you know there's<br>no magic Holy Grail to this thing but<br>you know if you look at world's best<br>practice that any number of four that<br>enable world best practice to be shared<br>but we don't have a methodical system<br>and often in the policy design stage<br>um I know it was different at your time<br>Graham in the in the 80s because there's<br>a real crisis you were well informed<br>about what was going on I'm sure I don't<br>see that as a regular part of the policy<br>process now<br>that people say where is this being done<br>really well uh there's there's a<br>reluctance I think to be open to that<br>sort of not invented here type of thing<br>I think that's we're quite defensive<br>about it has to be invented here<br>otherwise although you did say we should<br>look in the local community<br>it's not it's not either or you look at<br>look you look at all of them and you<br>test it and you throw it out there you<br>know and you do it with some speed and<br>alacrity and don't take three or four<br>years you know<br>and so I think I think at the<br>ministerial level<br>um certainly from a you do look overseas<br>you do look to see where it's being done<br>well and and before covert you'd go and<br>have a look and I did that on a number<br>of occasions<br>but you've always got to be careful at<br>what you see in another country is not<br>necessarily be able to be replicated in<br>New Zealand and the classic is probably<br>the most recent one is the three Waters<br>based on what happened in Scotland now<br>there's there's certain advantages in<br>the systems but you've got to put it<br>into the local<br>situation and you've got you've got to<br>put it into the local population you've<br>got you you've you've you've got to make<br>sure it's going to work in New Zealand<br>and that's often where I think we fail<br>is that we try and pick up something<br>from overseas and put it into New<br>Zealand without that different lens on<br>it and I and I agree with Martin within<br>our communities there's enormous<br>resourcefulness and that willingness to<br>do things just to get it done and that's<br>that character of new zealanders isn't<br>it we're the number eight wire type<br>people<br>but we're stifled by regulation<br>um you know we we're just making it so<br>difficult for ourselves<br>uh and and if you talk to anyone on<br>infrastructure at the moment on<br>construction prices are going through<br>the through the roof at sort of 20 to 30<br>percent increases and then when you<br>drive along a road where there's Road<br>Works happening we're down to one lane<br>and we're 50 meters away from where a<br>digger might be<br>sometimes I drive hard to find where a<br>person on that Digger is but you know<br>and we don't work 24 hours if you go to<br>Japan and they're putting an<br>infrastructure they're working 24 hours<br>they have to get it done we don't do<br>that it's hugely costly so we just pile<br>regulation and bureaucracy on top of it<br>until it just all takes so long it's so<br>hard and and our Innovative people end<br>up going overseas<br>finding somewhere else where it's a bit<br>easier<br>I'm sorry but we need some more<br>solutions over here don't we can we take<br>a question from the floor please<br>theme earlier today is sort of a thread<br>through all the conversation so far has<br>been about the Central and local<br>government as a provider of service to<br>our community<br>companies businesses social economic<br>organizations and the hurdles that that<br>government sometimes can provide I<br>wanted to just pick up on the thing with<br>data and metrics and outcomes and ask<br>the panel whether you can see parallels<br>from the economic regulation of other<br>Monopoly providers of services in New<br>Zealand whether it's electricity<br>airports Telco and are there any lessons<br>we should take from that which might<br>start to<br>Focus the government agencies on the<br>right outcomes because in my experience<br>there's nothing more powerful than the<br>sunlight of information to cause those<br>who are accountable for those things to<br>change behavior and do something about<br>it<br>I mentioned data um yeah I mean I think<br>if they bring back in some version<br>the some of the techniques that were<br>used in social investment there was a<br>still a Carter of data analysts around<br>the Ministries but they don't seem to<br>have access to leadership positions or<br>decision making but they would be able<br>to do exactly what you're talking about<br>I mean then to just to give you simple<br>examples the analysis has been done that<br>knows what you<br>potentially save<br>by kids who who are taken into this<br>state Care One Way or Another and the<br>condition that they're in at the time<br>they arrive having used historical data<br>and then saying the probability of<br>people who arrive like this<br>having a certain life outcome with<br>obviously a distribution of things<br>around that and not only the cost of<br>that the lives of these people have is<br>simply enormous<br>and we've known that those experiments<br>started in 2005 and I think you had<br>something to do with them<br>but somehow rather that still hasn't<br>become embedded as a core<br>decision-making tool right in the places<br>at ought to be and I think you could<br>bring it all back in about six months<br>frankly<br>and you get into a bit of Politics on<br>that so sorry you're picking up on that<br>because because<br>um I tried to do a lot of work with<br>those vulnerable children but but the<br>politics you know why would we call them<br>vulnerable we got rid of the word<br>vulnerable actually they are the most<br>vulnerable in our communities they<br>should be top but they still have to go<br>through all the different Hoops of all<br>the different criteria that all the<br>different government departments have<br>and that's mirrored in infrastructure<br>which you and I were just talking about<br>earlier<br>um that wakakotahi when it is deciding<br>on whether to build a particular road is<br>only looking at the benefits of<br>transport<br>it doesn't take into account what's<br>happening on either side of that<br>transport and whether there's any<br>housing that's released or commercial<br>activity that's released that would<br>account for the value so when we when we<br>come to those individual government<br>departments and you know we tried hard<br>as ministers and I know um there's a<br>there's efforts to try and amalgamate<br>some of that so do you look at things in<br>the hole and<br>all falls short I don't I don't<br>understand why but some maybe it's<br>something in our structure that we all<br>go back into our departments<br>um and all of you go back into your<br>departments and the ministers all go<br>back into theirs and get on with that<br>individual piece of work it just seems<br>hard to bring that all together<br>whether it's in social social welfare or<br>whether it's in in infrastructure<br>I think I think just to add in support<br>of that last comment of ends you know we<br>do have a vertical structure between<br>ministers with portfolio<br>responsibilities which are legislated<br>for one of the things I forgot to<br>mention is we are<br>you know quite unusual and being pretty<br>good about operating within the rule of<br>law in New Zealand and that is a really<br>valuable thing<br>um and I remember talking to both of<br>prime ministers I work closely with<br>saying you know if any ministers think<br>it's good to Corners you go and have a<br>look at the record of judicial review<br>against ministers decisions and it's the<br>Court's 100 ministers one you know so<br>it's not a path they want to go down but<br>the collaboration stuff is really hard<br>and it takes time and there's a lot of<br>inertia and sometimes you can sort it<br>out occasionally quite well at officials<br>level and then it gets the cabinet level<br>and it gets unpicked a bit or you know<br>then you've got legislation through the<br>house and there's more unpicking so you<br>know<br>there were a lot of voices that are<br>willing to be raised about why things<br>shouldn't be done you know and that's<br>really quite grinding both for ministers<br>and for officials and sometimes you can<br>find yourselves a year later back in the<br>same position so that's really<br>frustrating so you know it needs a bit<br>of a Shaker I mean that's the sort of<br>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and<br>trade<br>um just maybe a comment more than a<br>question but um there was a reference to<br>you know the importance of New Zealand<br>learning from overseas<br>um and just a little bit of a good news<br>story<br>um I ran a couple of streams um in the<br>economic division one of them is policy<br>insights where we task our posts<br>overseas and we work as domestic<br>agencies on policies that they're<br>interested in bringing in a New Zealand<br>or changing<br>um so a recent one was we worked with<br>the ministry for the environment on<br>their on New Zealand's nationally<br>determined contribution strategy and<br>they went out to um our posts around the<br>network went out and spoke to experts<br>and partner governments who had worked<br>on NDC strategies and learned about what<br>went well<br>um you know what which what were<br>challenges<br>um with the intention of bringing that<br>back<br>um to help with New Zealand strategy<br>that we're working on<br>um another one is the small advanced<br>economies initiative so that's uh of New<br>Zealand leads with fellow small advanced<br>economies of Singapore Switzerland<br>Ireland Denmark Finland Israel and again<br>it's an opportunity for officials to get<br>together learn from each other about<br>what policies have worked which have<br>which haven't to do that really key<br>information sharing and so we're not<br>just tinkering away in the garage in New<br>Zealand we're learning from what has<br>been you know world world class overseas<br>and of course there's our work in the<br>oecd which again is those policy leads<br>getting together and really working on<br>best practice so it is happening<br>well it's nice to have a positive story<br>if you've got any it was more of a<br>comment but if you wanted to respond you<br>may could we have a mic up to this table<br>please<br>um but so picking up on that just<br>picking up on them and going back to the<br>previous<br>session on education and we were always<br>I think for the last 20 30 years have<br>been looking at Finland and the<br>education system in Finland who always<br>beat us at the in the in the in the<br>international<br>um results but<br>we know what what is good about the<br>finished system and that is that they<br>train their teachers well extremely well<br>right through to Master's level and then<br>they pay them extremely well and they're<br>highly regarded in their Community I<br>think in New Zealand our teachers are<br>highly regarded but I don't think we<br>train them to that level and of course<br>there's always the the question that<br>Susan raised of how much we paid them so<br>we attract the very best people why<br>would a young scientist go into teaching<br>and earn half the money that they could<br>if they went into industry so you know<br>we we we're always we're all we might<br>know what's best practice in in<br>internationally but we're not always<br>willing to pay the price of that best<br>practice<br>almost to reverse it I actually worked<br>overseas for 20 years as a central<br>Banker both as an act of one and as an<br>advisor throughout most of that period<br>the IMF and most other advisors in the<br>area were using New Zealand as a role<br>model for best practice and not just in<br>targets but in things like governance<br>accountability all those nitty-gritty<br>issues of Central Banking but at the<br>same time as New Zealand was being used<br>as a role model almost everywhere I<br>worked New Zealand was reviewing what<br>they were doing we seemed to lose<br>confidence in our own ability where we<br>were regarded as a world leader by<br>almost everybody else<br>I'll comment on that I<br>um<br>Peter I mean your experience with this<br>has been astonishing really what you've<br>done with your career but I<br>look I see it this way what happened was<br>that because of the crisis in the 80s it<br>called for bold measures they were<br>developed and implemented and like any<br>such thing some of it works better than<br>others you get left with having a left<br>behind a wake of other second round<br>effects that you've triggered off and<br>things were happening in the bit you<br>weren't focusing on while you were<br>concentrating on the crisis so nothing<br>lasts forever there's in a democracy<br>it's always being adjusted now what<br>happened in New Zealand in my viewers<br>instead of<br>the policies that were introduced at<br>that time<br>being comprehensively and intelligently<br>critiqued to the point of saying here is<br>a well-defined better idea to apply to<br>this or that or the other thing what you<br>got was a cacophony of<br>academics who don't publish in much and<br>refereed International journals if you<br>see what I mean<br>uh just with a mantra saying well this<br>is all about outputs we've got to do<br>outcomes it's you know bumper stickers<br>like that which have a strong grain of<br>Truth in them but they never said well<br>actually if we did want to do outcomes<br>better how would we do it now the<br>consequence of that<br>is that you've now had 35 years of<br>steady erosion at the margins it's not<br>that you've gone from A system that was<br>designed to deal with a particular<br>situation and now you've got another one<br>so you do it again it's just you keep<br>filing the edges off the one that that<br>you inherited and I think that's what's<br>happened which has ended up with you<br>know me and a few others thinking it's<br>time to have another review of our<br>fiscal opportunities and institutions<br>you might not want to go back to those<br>something new in fact I'd argue<br>seriously it should be new but it's got<br>to have teeth<br>and it was kind of lost the teeth it's<br>sorry I thought there was a question at<br>the back um okay let me let me go with<br>one of the online questions that we've<br>got then<br>um that's that's um that's come through<br>and<br>um you know we've got this very sort of<br>big beast I think is a term I heard<br>Martin use at one stage of of different<br>parts of the public sector how do we<br>succeed in optimizing it and getting<br>these different outcomes it's such a big<br>problem now a short answer would be good<br>and I know you're better at finding the<br>identifying their problems and the<br>solutions but I'm going to put you on a<br>spot and ask you what do we do with this<br>big beast Martin how do how do we how do<br>we make progress<br>when we were doing prep for this last<br>week I said that Helen Clark used to say<br>to me several times a year trouble with<br>officials Martin I said the officials<br>are really good at pointing out the<br>problems they're not so good at offering<br>the answers<br>um so I think you've come back to haunt<br>me on that I've come back<br>um you're not a public official no well<br>I think optimizing the um the public<br>sector I think is um you know an<br>unattainable Nirvana<br>um to get it all right you know you've<br>got to have<br>good data you know you start from that<br>so good situational awareness then good<br>analysis which requires you know people<br>who are well schooled and trained and<br>got good experience and they can apply<br>the intellect to to interpreting what<br>they see and then coming up with some<br>options for policy choices then being<br>able to well present them persuasively<br>and get ministers to understand and get<br>in collaboration from other agencies<br>that's really powerful around the<br>cabinet table<br>um and then you've got to go have the<br>right decision made and timeliness is<br>always important<br>um and then of course there's the whole<br>question of implementation<br>um that Anne talked about and then<br>evaluation to see what works so that<br>process is a really long thing<br>um it may be I mean normally quite a<br>number of years before you really see<br>stuff but those elements should appear<br>and everything but the question is where<br>do you apply it<br>because the sector is so enormous I mean<br>I don't think we probably would agree we<br>don't need to have I'm sure there can<br>improvements that can be made to the<br>judicial system but<br>upending the the legal system and the<br>courts now is probably not the biggest<br>priority so I think selecting some of<br>the really big elements that are going<br>to have bigger Downstream effects as I<br>mentioned before about the agricultural<br>reforms similarly with the tax reforms<br>really strong bold positions and and the<br>the fiscal and monetary policy settings<br>once those were right lots of other<br>things started to fall into place<br>so I think some some attention to as a<br>step towards optimization which I don't<br>think you could ever achieve is to have<br>a sense about what are the really<br>critical<br>um you know<br>few areas where we need we need to<br>embark on a journey of refreshing and<br>reinvigorating and as mentioned earlier<br>today making sure that we're competitive<br>and also I think the attractive to a<br>migrant thing I mean I think that's one<br>of the one of the casualties of uh of<br>the cover thing is that as someone said<br>earlier than where the others are<br>putting the welcome mat up we're putting<br>up a hand that's saying No thank you<br>very much that can be devastating uh in<br>the medium and long term and I think<br>there are there are some areas like that<br>which really would<br>would be useful to look at in quite an<br>intense and wide way straight away get a<br>cluster of really big issues that you<br>think are going to make a difference and<br>try and start moving the dial on those<br>you can't do everything at once it's a<br>bit like local government you can't take<br>on the whole of local government once<br>it's a bit tricky but if you do<br>bite-sized chunks you might get some<br>change<br>and ask you about this these linkages<br>between the local and central government<br>you know the dysfunctions and how do we<br>how do we improve those dysfunctions<br>that might exist between those different<br>layers I I think the first thing we<br>should do is go to a four-year term for<br>both of them<br>um because that would allow much better<br>analysis and<br>give better time for for implementation<br>and seeing what works so I think that's<br>the first thing three years of turnover<br>and you think of the last we've had<br>literally two government two different<br>governments in in the last of the three<br>three years and so you start all over<br>again your public service changes your<br>ministers change and so your policies<br>change<br>um<br>the relationship between it's trying to<br>align uh well first of all there has to<br>be a trust between the two so all too<br>often central government doesn't trust<br>local government to to do the job so<br>they put more rules and regulations on<br>them they also put over to local<br>government the jobs they don't really<br>want to tackle or can't tackle<br>politically and you look at things like<br>local alcohol policies and gambling all<br>of that's been put out to local<br>government<br>in order to get local decision making<br>which is good but they are difficult<br>issues to deal with at the political<br>level but no funding comes with it no<br>support comes with that so all it does<br>is make local government it just affects<br>that relationship between the two and<br>that's really at the core of it is how<br>those two<br>essential parts of our Public Service<br>actually work together understand one<br>another and work to create a good place<br>for people for new zealanders to live in<br>and and a great country and<br>I mean I you know I've got lots of I've<br>got lots of suggestions but we haven't<br>got time<br>if the questions from the floor please<br>wave out for a microphone<br>otherwise I'm going to turn to a comment<br>that Rob Fife made this morning and he<br>talked about it was much easier to get<br>decisions through if you've got a small<br>number of people making those decisions<br>and I'm curious about your views on on<br>this we've talked about how we might<br>find Solutions is one solution to move<br>to much smaller groups of people making<br>decisions and what are the implications<br>for democracy when we do these sorts of<br>things so I'm curious about your your<br>views on whether that's a way forward or<br>it's the question of collaboration I<br>mean Jenny Shipley made a very important<br>speech in 1997 when she was minister of<br>State services and she said we've done<br>what we're going to do with all that<br>economy stuff the new agenda of social<br>policy and the rules have got to be<br>different because all of these things<br>interact and you need collaborative<br>processes and Minister's sicker hearing<br>public servants arguing with each other<br>in the cabinet and she was right<br>because these social policy problems<br>inherently need Integrated Solutions and<br>they're much harder to get but I've got<br>a thought I'll Express it's a bit risky<br>but I I think collaboration is expensive<br>it leads to interdepartmental committee<br>meetings with you know 30 people at them<br>and if you're lucky and a bit more<br>attention do we need to collaborate<br>about this can't we just say look this<br>is your issue go fix it because if you<br>look at some of the most heroic things<br>that's happened in New Zealand like<br>maybe the management of the second world<br>world war history says it was done by a<br>small hand full of people who actually<br>did a very good job didn't set up a into<br>departmental Coordinating Committee to<br>figure out how to prosecute the war so I<br>think a lot more care about where you<br>need to get complex and expensive<br>collaborations and when you can just<br>delegate the job to somebody and tell<br>commissioner with four Commissioners in<br>place from a council of I think it was<br>um and you do you do have to be careful<br>that you are getting a diversity of<br>thought around the table because I mean<br>when I first started in local government<br>in in the Napier city council and I<br>think they were 12 councilors and if we<br>all agreed on something<br>um I'd often think have we asked enough<br>questions and this isn't right if you if<br>the community never all agrees on<br>something<br>um so so you do need to make sure that<br>you get a variety of skills and a<br>variety of views around your decision<br>decision-making tables I get really<br>worried when we start saying we need to<br>have diversity and actually we're not<br>talking diversity of schools or thought<br>we're talking diversity about different<br>groups of people whether it's um from<br>different backgrounds from different<br>ethnicities from different genders uh<br>Etc and and the key to decision making<br>is having I think a reasonable number of<br>people well versed in the topic having<br>done their homework<br>and prepared to make a decision because<br>in the end governance requires decisions<br>and all too often both at Central and<br>local levels we see governance that is<br>not prepared to make the hard decisions<br>it is tough to go out it's going to be<br>tough to go out and say to some<br>communities I'm sorry but we're not<br>going to rebuild in that place ever<br>again<br>that's going to be a really tough<br>decision that we're going to have to be<br>saying right across the country<br>sorry but we're not going to allow you<br>to to rebuild or to build in that place<br>because it is not safe<br>um so so you know really strong decision<br>makers<br>have a um have those skills that I've<br>just outlined what the numbers are I I I<br>don't know I don't think four is enough<br>to run the fifth largest city in in New<br>Zealand I think you do need more than<br>that to get that diversity of thought<br>particularly but I agree I mean I I went<br>to meetings where there would be an army<br>of officials<br>and and set with the with my cabinet<br>colleagues and you were dying to get<br>some really good hard hissing advice I<br>always said I wanted The Good the Bad<br>and the Ugly but you can't win this sort<br>of 40 odd people sitting in a room no<br>one's going to give no one's going to<br>put their head above the water to do it<br>then so too much collaboration is<br>overwhelming and doesn't produce good<br>results but but<br>you do need you do need to be working<br>across some of those portfolios<br>and and working together as a group of<br>ministers and a group of of officials<br>and then I'm with graham then just get<br>on delegate it to someone get on and<br>deliver it and trust them<br>so the right numbers of people the right<br>types of people and that willingness to<br>to make decisions as part of the<br>governance is a strong message it came<br>through and I think that's part of a<br>solution isn't it we're certainly ending<br>up at the solution Martin any last<br>comment from well I was just thinking of<br>um<br>what Anne was saying there you know I<br>think our cabinet system with the<br>Committees actually works pretty well<br>I've had hundreds of those cabinet<br>committee meetings and there are you<br>know most cabinet committees are 10 or<br>12 people and there's a you know sitting<br>from the foot of the table as I always<br>was there's the PM and the senior<br>ministers who've you know got a bit more<br>gray hair and experienced a few step<br>marks on their back and they and then<br>there are ones who are learning the<br>ropes a bit more but when they come<br>together it's very powerful and pretty<br>impressive to see and this the clarity<br>of thinking and the willingness to take<br>a decision<br>and the fact that you don't have<br>hundreds of officials in those rooms or<br>all of the back benches or the whole of<br>the caucus is a really really good thing<br>because and that's I think one of the<br>the enduring benefits of out the way New<br>Zealand prime ministers have always<br>continued to run our cabinet system<br>which is that it's ministers only and<br>long may that last I was advised by some<br>of our Central agency colleagues when a<br>certain government came into power that<br>we should make a strong bid that the<br>head of the prime minister's Department<br>should also sit in the cabinet offer in<br>the cabinet meeting and I said I'm not<br>going to do that and I will not propose<br>it and that's it it's a ministerial and<br>political space and they need to have<br>the full Authority and they need to take<br>responsibility for it and they take the<br>advice and stuff so that works well but<br>you know<br>um concentrating the decision making in<br>that sort of way I think is really<br>beneficial and I think ending on that<br>Authority and responsibility is actually<br>quite a nice way to end the government's<br>own isn't it<br>um we're out of time now we our next<br>panel coming up is infrastructure<br>Housing and Development so Matt will be<br>taking over so you can see there are<br>strong linkages between all of these<br>panels but what a wonderful set of<br>insights we've had from our three<br>speakers today I thank them all very<br>much for their insights and sometimes<br>from a little bit of distance that<br>you've had from the decisions that<br>you're involved with in the past they<br>were able to really bring a wealth of<br>experience and insights to us so thank<br>you very much to all of you<br>foreign<br>I see a sliver of natural light entering<br>the back of the room but we're going to<br>keep you in here for a little bit longer<br>until just after five o'clock so thank<br>you for sticking with us I am reflecting<br>back on a couple of the other economics<br>forums we've run and I was particularly<br>interested in that session because when<br>we're talking about this we're often<br>talking about issues of policy and so<br>the way that our public sector is set up<br>at essential on the local government<br>level the interaction between the<br>political uh and the officials the<br>political elements and the officials and<br>advice is so fundamental to the way that<br>everything else we're talking about<br>works so now coming out from how the<br>system works to one part of it next<br>session on infrastructure Housing and<br>Development<br>um like many of our topics it's uh<br>essentially never been so topical and we<br>have an excellent panel so I welcome the<br>it's so tight it's tight when we've got<br>all right so we have uh with us Simon<br>Bridges a well-known face to everybody<br>in New Zealand uh now leading the<br>Auckland business chamber and who has<br>recently along with his uh co-chairs of<br>the chambers of waikato and Bay of<br>Plenty who are both in the room met<br>Cowley and Don good launched the uh an<br>infrastructure Forum further top of the<br>North Island we also have Chris Meehan<br>uh CEO and chair of Winton Property<br>Group one of New Zealand's largest<br>property development groups we have<br>Tanya tapsel the mayor of Rotorua lakes<br>and also with the background and<br>resource planning and we have Brad Olson<br>the CEO principal Economist of<br>infametrics so a fantastic panel with a<br>broad range of views I will hand over to<br>you I'm going to start on this side<br>Simon I'm going to set the time warning<br>three to five minutes otherwise I give a<br>conspicuous cough and we're in your<br>hands hey well thanks very much um Matt<br>can you hear me uh and thank you for<br>what you do on your leadership here at<br>waikato and of course they've put it on<br>things like this which is hugely<br>important I mean I think um the first<br>thing to say is when we're thinking<br>infrastructure on<br>obviously um enthusiastic and make sure<br>when it comes to transport really more<br>than some of the other areas and things<br>have absolutely changed uh I think as a<br>result of what's happened in the last<br>month or so once in the cyclone and we<br>hear the situation at the moment that<br>you know as well as I do we are key<br>communities the more uh Gisborne Thai<br>Rafferty uh the Hawkes Bay coromandel<br>are cut off and they're key routes in<br>and out that fight for the communities<br>and also their Freight and supply chain<br>are cut off I mean I've been thinking<br>about this it seems to be what's really<br>important is both the short term and the<br>long-term around this and what can<br>happen is that different groups can make<br>the mistake of focusing only on one<br>politicians obviously sometimes focus on<br>short term but I think what's also true<br>is think tanks in groups that are in<br>this space often focus on the long-term<br>existence of the children the short term<br>is really important and I know you've<br>got Adrian all here I met uh tomorrow<br>and he said well you know um because of<br>the inflation a bit really either we<br>have detects more or spend uh less<br>um the logic of that is there our city<br>don't want to see more taxes I think<br>we've got an economic environment where<br>that would be<br>um that would that would be fraught when<br>it comes to spending this look obviously<br>it's about priorities but what I would<br>say here is it's not as a an investing<br>in our infrastructure and our road area<br>Works we're wasting money we are<br>investing in our future and into<br>generational Investments so it seems to<br>me at a level it has to happen but I<br>also think in reality we're talking<br>about an environment that's got low uh<br>public debt at New Zealand relative to<br>other countries and so in the end as I<br>say we've sort of got to get on and do<br>it I was interested in what Ann was<br>saying the last one I think what's<br>really important here in rebuilding<br>these networks is Pace I was involved in<br>kaikuru kaikuru earthquakes and the the<br>rebuild there and what happened there<br>was Parliament came together that almost<br>unanimously not entirely unanimously but<br>um it has for more to do it with and<br>that was important prioritization is<br>also really important and I think<br>government should be really quickly<br>identifying which routes need to be done<br>first and getting on with those and<br>having those second tier ones there<br>um you know for later in the sense I<br>think the other thing that's really<br>interesting and all of this is the level<br>of service that new zealanders expect<br>and the reality is<br>um you know if you're a central Auckland<br>that the level of service you get in<br>transport needs a bit higher than<br>um<br>uh older electrics and gifts and some of<br>the the back blocks<br>um but I think we have to be really<br>careful that when we're talking about<br>um managed Retreat we accept that<br>actually communities oftentimes even if<br>it is at a gravel road level do require<br>a level of service and and be cautious<br>about sort of saying well no we're not<br>going to do that anymore because of<br>clearly when we build back better things<br>will change and there'll be different<br>routes in the life but actually that<br>shouldn't be an excuse for actually a<br>bit of ambition around what we need to<br>do in New Zealand over the next year or<br>so there's probably enough of a soapbox<br>for me I was feeling a tickle but I'm<br>all good so thank you Simon Tanya<br>like I think it's a really interesting<br>discussion and flows on really nicely<br>from the previous panel I really come to<br>this panel with the perspective of<br>localism<br>whether that says the new mayor of which<br>I spent nine years as the local<br>councilor as well<br>um all my time on the New Zealand<br>community board so you've heard already<br>across the country and when you take<br>that in a perspective we are the people<br>that are also looking after our<br>provincial in our rural areas of which<br>New Zealand is predominantly made up of<br>so I know in these discussions we tend<br>to focus on the big cities on Auckland<br>on Wellington in a way on Hamilton as<br>well but we can't forget that New<br>Zealand we think about it there are many<br>many communities out there so how do we<br>make sure that we keep that local voice<br>and infrastructure that is our job as<br>councils infrastructure is one of the<br>biggest expenditure items but you're<br>here today as well that centralization<br>sorry I'll just keep talking and<br>hopefully you can hear me that we are a<br>very centralized country now you put<br>perspective and all the public<br>expenditure that we spend in New Zealand<br>uh water the three Waters currently<br>the perspective if we look at what other<br>countries do Korea 40 USA 50<br>Australia 60 so why is New Zealand so so<br>centralized at 90 percent of public<br>expenditure being made by decision<br>makers in government and Parliament so<br>is the future for us on unlocking<br>infrastructure providing quality<br>infrastructure but also remembering that<br>that unlocks the Housing and Development<br>that we need will we be better served by<br>further centralizing and I'm going to<br>say it the three Waters and other key<br>decision-making abilities when it's our<br>local communities in New Zealand that<br>need to make sure that they not only<br>keep their local voice but are able to<br>continue to be thriving in a way that<br>best suits them as well<br>I know we've seen across the country<br>some criticisms of council I know we've<br>had things like Commissioners come into<br>place but remember it is your role and<br>your opportunity every three years to<br>vote so the big question that I always<br>put out is why is voter turnout so low<br>as well why is there only four out of<br>ten people voting for councils so when<br>we put that into perspective those are<br>the facts and figures that's what we're<br>dealing with infrastructure is a really<br>crucial part but I wanted to touch<br>briefly because we do have a solution as<br>well and I want to give an example of<br>how we help to unlock housing now in<br>Joshua we did partner between our local<br>Council the government and also local<br>ewe to create a housing Accord so we<br>have infrastructure in place we know<br>where we need it but we need to unlock<br>housing and we also need to stop which<br>unfortunately you probably have heard of<br>the emergency housing motels in<br>Rochester and actually across the<br>country as well that was only a symptom<br>of a failed investment in infrastructure<br>to unlock the housing and unlock<br>affordable housing across the country so<br>the solution that we came up with and<br>believe it or not we are working<br>together in good faith and we're getting<br>good progress with the government as<br>well so we signed a housing Accord<br>shortly after being elected what that<br>does is we've got a few shared outcomes<br>but we actually share resources as well<br>so I know there's a lot of Doom and<br>Gloom these all the things that are<br>wrong but we have already seen such<br>great progress through that housing<br>Accord that those emergency housing<br>motels have not only halved but we have<br>gone from about 350 families to now 152<br>families in there because they are also<br>progressing into the houses that are now<br>there because we fast-tracked that<br>development and that growth as well so<br>that's probably my comments for now but<br>happy to contribute later as well it was<br>itching to go but thank you Tanya and<br>it's great to have for the session some<br>of the the positives as well Chris<br>thanks Matt so<br>I guess I come from this to this<br>discussion from the perspective of a<br>bloke that goes to work every day with a<br>super talented team of people and a fair<br>bit of resource<br>and all we want to do is build more and<br>more and more houses and and you would<br>think when you you Google the words<br>housing crisis in New Zealand and you<br>get about a hundred thousand articles<br>come up in your face<br>you would think that's a fairly<br>straightforward proposition<br>but unfortunately the the reality for us<br>is we we spend most of our time and most<br>of our resource battling bureaucracy to<br>get it done<br>now you take a wider View and you say<br>okay here's this great country of New<br>Zealand that we all love so much<br>and you look at the Urban Land content<br>of New Zealand the Urban Land<br>constitutes less than one percent of our<br>land mass so you say to yourself well<br>why is there a housing crisis we're not<br>short of land we're not short of<br>resource we're not sure of smart people<br>to build them<br>why are we short of houses<br>so you know when we break it down in<br>cost terms it's purely a problem of our<br>own making the regulatory environment<br>that we operate in mostly under the RMA<br>is such that we've put this<br>artificial constraint on the supply of<br>houses in New Zealand and that make no<br>mistake that is what has caused the<br>housing crisis<br>so we've Bentley our way through this<br>regulation every day of Our Lives we and<br>if some of you might find this<br>remarkable but we genuinely do spend<br>more money on bureaucracy and legal<br>cases and and just general regulatory<br>navigation than we do on physically<br>building a section and that is<br>ridiculous it's not good for anyone<br>so you then look at the sort of the<br>social costs of of this shortage of<br>houses and the regulatory cost that the<br>consumer the house owner ends up paying<br>and the social costs are enormous you're<br>seeing you know kids that are<br>transferred from school to school and<br>your truancy rates are higher because<br>they never get settled and you're seeing<br>people living in garages and cars and<br>all the health problems and the social<br>problems and the crime that comes out<br>the back of it and it's a huge social<br>cost and one that I think that New<br>Zealand's going to Bear the bundle for<br>many many years<br>so why do we do this to ourselves I mean<br>if you've made an analogy and and bear<br>with me on this a little bit but if you<br>write an analogy it was the the housing<br>market and the the RMA regulatory reform<br>and and the health of new zealanders you<br>wouldn't find the government<br>putting some sort of additive in the<br>water to make us all sick and then spend<br>billions of dollars making us better<br>again in housing the government<br>regulates that we can't have any houses<br>then spends billions of dollars<br>dealing with the problem and that's just<br>not on<br>so I guess where I see it is we've just<br>got into this regulatory Maya that's<br>very tough to get out of<br>and we're not moving forward I mean I'm<br>sorry to say the new RMA is diabolical<br>and there are many many<br>very practiced practitioners very<br>experienced practitioners who were just<br>leaving the industry because they they<br>can't be the sort of dealing with it for<br>another 10 years<br>and then you've got the UDA which is no<br>secret that we're battling with the<br>government to<br>get access to that but you know you've<br>got all this regulatory<br>stuff coming down the pipeline that<br>honestly from a practitioner's point of<br>view from someone that just as I said<br>wants to get out of bed and go and build<br>some houses it's just getting worse and<br>worse and worse so when you Google the<br>words housing crisis 10 years from now<br>instead of a hundred thousand hits<br>you're going to see a million hits and<br>that's a really sad thing to New Zealand<br>and I think the solution<br>which we should address<br>is really you need a big stick from<br>government somewhere you've got to break<br>the cycle and you've got to have<br>somewhere from government say okay you<br>know what rather than spend half the<br>money of a section cost on paperwork and<br>the other half I'm building it let's<br>take that half and let the developer go<br>and do their own infrastructure because<br>we can do it cheaper than most that we<br>can open up huge big slides of land but<br>just give us the go ahead to do it stop<br>stop saying no let's let's become a<br>country that wants to address this<br>housing crisis by starting to say yes a<br>bit more often<br>Chris thank you and to Brad<br>well I I feel like um let's see if I can<br>get the mic to work will be the first<br>one<br>um was that working yet no I don't think<br>it is I'll grab that one<br>um I I think I mean you've invited an<br>economist to the economics forum and uh<br>you know as the Dismal science I think<br>it's always dangerous<br>um but I'll sort of go with uh where<br>Tanya went as well in terms of uh more<br>of a bouquet than a brick bet and that's<br>to note that despite all the challenges<br>and gosh I'm looking forward to talking<br>about them there are some good things<br>that have been going on at the end of<br>last year or into September rather the<br>amount of other construction uh going on<br>in the country so Network infrastructure<br>was at its highest proportion of the<br>economy since 2010 at 3.62 if you strip<br>out mining it's the highest since the<br>70s so we are starting to move in a<br>better place there's still hundreds of<br>billions of dollars worth of<br>infrastructure still to be deployed but<br>I think it's worthwhile highlighting<br>that we're starting to at least move in<br>a better Direction<br>the two things that get me and and again<br>um this is an economics Forum as well as<br>all the other conversations we've been<br>having the first one is around<br>incentives and I really don't think that<br>we've got them very well aligned and<br>importantly I don't think that they<br>function uh or or uh at any point being<br>discussed when we talk about the big<br>issues if we think of water for example<br>which as a wellingtonian um I'm quite<br>Keen to get some pipes that will bring<br>me water uh at the right time not in a<br>puddle out in the street and we'll take<br>the water that I don't want away from my<br>house without it ending up also on the<br>street<br>um is that when we think about the<br>incentives if if I'm a council if I'm uh<br>you know an over and Tauranga and<br>Fontana down and Rotorua uh if I want to<br>build a road I get 50 on that from nzta<br>if I want to build a pipe I'm paying for<br>that fully myself and so it's pretty<br>clear that over time and more<br>importantly you can see the road and<br>people talk about it and like it the<br>pipes underground are no one season<br>Until It Breaks so I feel like the<br>incentives are a bit warped financially<br>and we've got to think about addressing<br>that you know where is the a<br>conversation about the national land<br>transport fund but for water where's the<br>conversation around some of the water<br>metering and charges that we might be<br>doing better because we don't fund it<br>properly the same when it comes to<br>housing I mean we just you heard from<br>Chris how difficult it is when he has to<br>deal with all of the uh you know the<br>Council planning rules and similar if I<br>go into a council building and say I<br>want to build a house I reckon you<br>should get a bottle of champagne these<br>days you you're doing a good job but<br>correct me if I'm wrong but if you do<br>that at the moment they're going gosh<br>that's more work that I now have to fund<br>from somewhere and so I think the<br>difficulty again is that where's the<br>incentive if I'm a council I've got to<br>do more work and I get less money for it<br>got to figure out am I ltp where I put<br>the next amount of infrastructure how<br>many DC's I charge and every other<br>acronym Under the Sun but I don't get<br>paid anything so where is that thought<br>around actually where that Revenue comes<br>from so that it can support the right<br>incentives it's not just about the money<br>itself it's about putting the right<br>conditions economically for people to go<br>yeah I like that that does well for me<br>because I get paid to do it<br>the second bit and and a wider Point uh<br>that is going to come into sharp relief<br>with uh what's happened with the Cyclone<br>recently is prioritization we do not<br>have the materials we do not have the<br>people to do everything we want to do<br>right here and now and we're seeing that<br>all the time and and for everyone who<br>says oh yeah but we managed to get away<br>with it well given how crumbling some of<br>our infrastructure seems to be it I I'd<br>submit that probably not uh might be the<br>case I'm a northlander at the moment the<br>brand new ones are stuffed uh that is<br>the major transport Network into the<br>entire Northern Region the fastest<br>growing population Zone in the country<br>and we've said you know what guys sorry<br>your holiday Highway means that you can<br>get cut off that's disgusting and I<br>would suggest that we need to have a<br>much better conversation around what are<br>the priorities now that's a difficult<br>discussion but when it comes to<br>infrastructure I am worried that we seem<br>to think that we can do everything all<br>the time no matter what it is and the<br>simple fact of the matter is we can't if<br>we're going to get serious about the uh<br>sort of infrastructure that we want to<br>build in this country we are going to<br>have to to make tough decisions about<br>not only what gets funded but also what<br>doesn't and what we are willing and able<br>to put on the back burner because there<br>has to be stuff that comes first if you<br>don't the market works very well at<br>telling you that the stuff you already<br>started happens and the stuff that you<br>didn't start but really desperately<br>wanted to well it goes and goes and goes<br>further and further down the line so I<br>think we do have to have a really<br>serious conversation about that<br>prioritization what that looks like<br>across the country but also how we<br>integrate that because increasingly<br>we're not doing uh the sort of Linked UP<br>infrastructure that we need to every<br>single acronym Under the Sun and<br>Wellington has a different idea of where<br>the next bit of infrastructure needs to<br>go which means that you've got people in<br>the construction sector running around<br>like mad cats trying to get to the next<br>site because we're never joined up so I<br>think we've got a lot of work to do<br>around prioritization we've got to sit<br>the right incentives and the right<br>funding to get into a better position<br>but I am at least grateful that we are<br>building more infrastructure now than we<br>have done before<br>brilliant no cough either<br>and we will come back to prioritization<br>a little bit later look there's a lot of<br>that a lot in that and there are some<br>questions coming through I'm actually<br>going to start one with You Chris and<br>you don't all need to comment on every<br>issue there'll be different things that<br>um that spark your interests more<br>so there's huge amounts of bureaucracies<br>you've said there's the cost of that<br>it's costing more to get through that<br>side than to actually put up the house<br>if we were at a different Forum one of<br>the discussions would probably be about<br>might be about RMA or its Replacements<br>saying but it hasn't worked for the<br>other reasons maybe we need more because<br>obviously some of the environmental<br>outcomes haven't been what we've wanted<br>how do we get that mix right between<br>what the regulation is trying to achieve<br>make things simpler easier but also get<br>to good outcomes<br>without it costing more than it'll<br>actually cost to do the work and I'm<br>really interested in your view on that<br>and this is something of course others<br>might have a view and Simon of course<br>you've been on the other side of um some<br>of those ministerial roles around uh<br>Ministry of Transport and so on as well<br>but I think you know as I said the<br>default position from most councils and<br>and or anything from government<br>generally to more housing Supply the<br>default position is no and often the no<br>is because they don't want to pay for<br>the infrastructure and then I go and<br>spend more money fighting against that<br>no than I would have otherwise been in<br>doing the infrastructure myself which is<br>ridiculous<br>um<br>so I think how do you fix it I think I<br>think the first thing is<br>you need to break the cycle so I think<br>if if we're and Brad might argue to<br>pitch and toss but any any Economist<br>seems to put the number currently at<br>somewhere between 50 and 100 000 houses<br>that we're short today you might argue<br>anyway I think it's in that region<br>there's a lot there's a lot yeah<br>um but I think if you're going to just<br>break the cycle quickly and then deal<br>with the regulatory reform which will no<br>doubt take some time I think you need a<br>big stick from the government that says<br>okay<br>Mr developer whoever it might be we'll<br>give you this patch of land you could<br>often do the infrastructure yourself we<br>won't bug you down in regulation you<br>build five or ten thousand houses over<br>there and we'll leave you to it I think<br>that would break the the cycle while you<br>didn't figure out how to get the RMA<br>back into check I think one of the the<br>the balancing things they are in my set<br>out to do was to balance the the urban<br>outcome was the environmental outcome<br>but as I said we occupy one percent of<br>the land mass if we occupied 1.1 percent<br>of the land mass this problem goes away<br>so I think we surely can figure a way to<br>do that and not offend the environmental<br>outcomes that the rmi-6 to positive<br>great did anybody else want to jump in<br>on that or otherwise I can I've got a<br>lot here<br>I mean just just to the point around<br>funding how do I hold this so it works<br>um is is I think that that exact point<br>around you've also like to say you've<br>got to give the different options right<br>I mean we talked any good panel has a<br>briefing uh beforehand we talked about<br>the likes of ppps as well and sort of<br>getting uh the ability for the private<br>sector to get more involved I think<br>there is a big part in that<br>um but but a lot of the time I think we<br>talk a lot about you know where does the<br>money come from and actually there's<br>huge amounts of money out there if only<br>we're willing to do it there is I think<br>a nervousness sometimes to get the<br>infrastructure done<br>um I was perfectly submit that both<br>sides of the coin public and private<br>sector have done bad things before and<br>things have gone wrong<br>um if that's the case for both then sort<br>of no one is blameless and I feel like<br>we've got to find a Better Way Forward<br>rather than saying well you can't do it<br>well you can't either so therefore it<br>doesn't get done that that is an awful<br>place for us to get to as a country<br>given how much we need to do<br>all right Brad earlier<br>in to pre-warn this as a question coming<br>to you Tanya but it's something that's<br>been sparked by your comments spread the<br>incentives you know somebody wants to<br>build a house wants to build a road all<br>of those things from where you sit<br>you've talked about some really good<br>things happening<br>what's either working with the<br>incentives that you've got in play now<br>or how could those incentives be<br>improved so that some of the things that<br>seem obvious can actually start<br>happening<br>I think to answer that question and<br>something that's been on the back of my<br>mind now stepping into this role as<br>mayor is we get so focused on making<br>change when actually we just need to<br>make it count so when we only have a<br>limited uh time and limited money<br>available and by us will be very limited<br>because our only income is rates how do<br>we ensure that any dollar that we are<br>spending will get the return on<br>investment but also tangible practical<br>outcomes for our community where they<br>can have confidence so I think it goes<br>back to being really clear right from<br>the start what are we trying to achieve<br>and then actually sit in that direction<br>clearly because I think where we get a<br>lot of the rounded circles and a lot of<br>the delays is we as politicians sit this<br>is our 10-year plan this is our annual<br>plan this is what we want to do but we<br>don't give clear Direction on how when<br>and why and how it actually becomes<br>really important when it comes to<br>delivering which is why I'm so so<br>passionate about localism because we can<br>say yes we want to save money here yes<br>we want to build more but how do we make<br>that practical in terms of do we<br>actually have the skills and resources<br>in this District to be able to do it<br>when we bring the skilled people in<br>where they're going to live where<br>they're going to stay and then how do we<br>and I think actually antoli touched on<br>this really well as well in terms of<br>when you see writing projects and are we<br>doing efficiently enough so I think to<br>answer that question it's not<br>necessarily about<br>um the change that's needed it is just<br>making that limited resource that we<br>have count and holding ourselves as<br>politicians and decision makers to<br>account more than just continuously<br>blaming it on the people who are only<br>there and this is a lot of our staff<br>they're delivering on what we ask them<br>to do in the first place<br>great thank you<br>um Simon I'm going to come to you there<br>was a very very direct question and I<br>don't know if this is placing you in a<br>position but you know you're well<br>skilled at that but I'll answer the<br>question I want so don't worry<br>that's right can you hear me<br>so<br>Light Rail Auckland getting a lot of<br>media now I think there's a big<br>discussion here that we're going to<br>spend a bit more time on around<br>prioritization<br>what do you think should happen what is<br>happening yeah I mean look now I'm out<br>of Polish I try and be a little bit<br>careful about um particular projects<br>that the truth of the light rail one is<br>you know<br>um I've always been deeply skeptical<br>um I know some of the people on the uh<br>the board and like raul.com great deal<br>of time for them I think you know if any<br>of them can kind of anyone can deliver<br>it that they they could<br>um and they present quite a compelling<br>case around what it means in terms of<br>City shaping and urban transformation<br>all these wonderful things I think you<br>still have to come back to the fact<br>though when you're thinking about light<br>rail it is such a sharp and proteins it<br>quite literally is the funding for<br>everything else in war and so it comes<br>to that question of prioritization<br>um I think if they would have put<br>forward the case for one discrete<br>portion of it with the benefit and cost<br>of that laid out that there is a case to<br>be made for that and there could be a<br>debate on that but I think the overall<br>thing is so big uh that that's uh that<br>that's a real issue and it will be<br>susceptible and I put no blame kind of<br>on anyone it will be specific<br>schools with that given that this is a<br>you know 20 30 thing a 30-year thing<br>if if not longer thank you anybody else<br>on light rail while we're here no here<br>um was it really falling on the things<br>that I think all of the parents said and<br>that is around funding I sort of tried<br>to make it cool<br>throated kind of case in my open remarks<br>that actually funding isn't the real<br>issue that's not to talk about it Money<br>Matters borrowing matters all of these<br>things that's not just either that the<br>public model isn't broken our national<br>land transport fund at the moment has<br>been asked to fund rail ever grow public<br>transport subsidy and the Roads<br>Maintenance and Improvement now all of<br>those things are good things but but<br>it's doing more than it ever kind of<br>could the biggest issue though on<br>infrastructure today and I think Brad<br>touched on this I I hope you'd agree but<br>it's capacity and capability mainly that<br>the firms and the workers to do it and I<br>let's go there right now and we've got<br>people in the in the room on this let's<br>say we can money's unlimited you know 18<br>months ago that felt like it was true<br>um<br>we do have relatively low public debt we<br>can go out and Source funds if we want<br>we've already had discussions on<br>immigration a bit earlier in the day and<br>lots of different views but let's say we<br>had the money we went big<br>can we actually deliver with the skills<br>that we've got here now because this<br>isn't just people digging holes or not<br>just there's that there's a hell of a<br>lot of geotechnical work there's a hell<br>of a lot of project management do we<br>actually have the skills in the country<br>to deliver what we want I'm going to<br>start with You Chris 100 I mean if you<br>look at all of the the big civil<br>projects in the Middle East and and you<br>know some in Europe I mean the the Kiwi<br>engineer the Kiwi planner the Kiwi uh<br>construction manager is the most widely<br>sought after on the planet we 100<br>definitely have the skills<br>um and I think<br>that's not going to go away anytime soon<br>yeah I mean I just totally disagree<br>um<br>I mean um right now uh<br>on on a variety of kind of boards and<br>things online you've got a waste<br>management sector there's your rubbish<br>they need several thousand workers so<br>their workers are working overtime it's<br>just not remotely sustainable same is<br>true in the National Road carriers for a<br>Monon in the many hundreds of truck<br>drivers they need not tomorrow not the<br>second time right now but they don't<br>have so the the system is just not<br>sustainable you add to that the fact<br>that we've got a rebuild to do that's<br>going to require hundreds if not<br>thousands of workers and obviously a<br>really big issue um<br>what the government said is good and I<br>give them that you know I give them a<br>tick they've announced a recovery Visa<br>but the issue with the recovery Visa is<br>it is explicitly short term I don't know<br>if you saw where Australia was at um<br>just last week but yeah um labor party<br>uh home office I think they call it uh<br>Minister Cleo Claire O'Neill I think<br>your name is she sick quite clearly<br>they're going more pro-business there is<br>no short term every immigrant that comes<br>to New Zealand will shortly have a<br>pathway to Residence and the problem<br>with immigration is good isn't good<br>enough it has to be better in our case<br>if Australia has a better Pathway to<br>residency that's where the Filipino<br>truck driver or the Indian contractor<br>will go so look I I ate a level I take<br>Chris's point with there are skills that<br>could come back but a raw physical terms<br>we're going to need a whole lot more<br>migrants and that's got to downplay the<br>issues around housing that they'll have<br>and so on and they're just not here at<br>the moment and sorry I'll differentiate<br>the two things we have the skill set<br>and the brain power we don't have the<br>Manpower which I think are two distinct<br>things<br>good thank you I think as well I mean<br>you look at all of the large<br>infrastructure projects that we're<br>currently doing and ask if we can even<br>do I know that I see that infrastructure<br>levels are as high as I've been which is<br>true but I'm worried that they won't go<br>a whole lot further how's Dunedin<br>Hospital going at the moment how's the<br>manawatu gorge replacement going that's<br>what nearly 10 years uh so far<br>um I'm not convinced that we have the<br>ability to deliver the large projects<br>that we've currently got on the cards at<br>the moment I was at whangarei hospital<br>last year as my grandfather passed away<br>and the windows were falling out of the<br>goddamn place like no I I don't think<br>that we've got the planning the people<br>all the resources to necessarily do this<br>sort of stuff at the moment more<br>importantly the panel uh earlier when it<br>will feel the panels earlier we heard<br>about education we heard about the likes<br>of um immigration I know that in some<br>parts of the country there are three<br>times as many people leaving the<br>workforce in the next 10 years as there<br>are coming in that's going to make it<br>even more difficult we don't have enough<br>water technicians at the moment you've<br>got government departments that are<br>paying over the tops to find building<br>control offices and stealing them from<br>councils I'm I feel like we're playing a<br>little bit of musical chairs at the<br>moment um so I'm not convinced that we<br>have the the skills the people the<br>resources Simon's point is right around<br>the money in a sense that yes we could<br>go out tomorrow and the government could<br>borrow hundreds of billions of dollars<br>what are we gonna do with it who's going<br>to spend it we're going to spend it on<br>even more expensive stuff and probably<br>deliver less for it so I'm not convinced<br>I know that's pessimistic and I but I<br>feel like in a sense it's also realistic<br>it says that we do need to get back to<br>basics but we've got to have a pretty<br>clear plan what are we trying to do with<br>the resources that we've got we know the<br>order is broken we know that our health<br>care System needs more investment we<br>know that parts of Education need the<br>same thing there is no plan in this<br>country that says what we're going to do<br>next on infrastructure councils have got<br>half of the solution they've got where<br>some of the network infrastructure is<br>and after that we leave it to every<br>individual department and government to<br>come up with what they're doing next<br>there is no integrated Asset Management<br>plan everyone was surprised the other<br>year when there was poo running down the<br>walls at middlemore and there was um you<br>know mold in a classroom in Upper Hutt<br>or in the Hut I think it was why were we<br>surprised no one had ever thought about<br>you know ensuring that those assets were<br>renewed we just hope that they go over<br>and then when they fall over we go oh<br>damn it'll be 10 years before we get to<br>that again if we're so bad at actually<br>planning the uh the past and the present<br>I'm a little bit worried about the<br>future<br>and it's too right but I think this is<br>where that making it counts really<br>important because yes we do have the<br>skill set and yes we don't<br>we drive people so what do we do the<br>solution is actually making those tough<br>decisions now there are a lot of<br>councils going through our annual plan<br>process right at the moment what<br>politicians have never been good at is<br>actually delivering on their Promises of<br>stopping the spend so now we have to get<br>really real really serious because our<br>people are not getting paid any more<br>money to be paying any more rates for<br>all of that additional infrastructure<br>that we need and we have a really<br>critical<br>crisis where a lot of our engineers and<br>councils if not already our retirement<br>age are approaching retirement age and<br>we do not have a succession plan of them<br>coming through now that's pretty serious<br>when you think about Waters and<br>infrastructure as well so again what can<br>we do with what we have make the most of<br>it make those hard decisions prioritize<br>so that the people that we do have on<br>the ground can actually deliver<br>wanting to really brief comments and<br>then I'm going to be well behaved but I<br>just you know I'm not suggesting that<br>there is a bottomless paper money no no<br>one's suggesting that but what worries<br>me is I don't want to see<br>um the funding issue become an excuse<br>when you take State Highway 1 and to<br>Northland for example for doing a proper<br>job the reality of that road is pretty<br>simple the first part that's four lanes<br>stood up perfectly no issues whatsoever<br>fundamentally but the risk that having<br>had the resiliency factors built in is a<br>sham box and we still can't use it<br>properly so we do need to plan do those<br>and there's plenty of funding ways<br>whether pvps or loans uh<br>intergenerationally to make that happen<br>that we could sort of do that so I think<br>that's<br>um that that's a pretty important point<br>Thank You Simon uh one question from<br>Adrian sort of a a question and a<br>statement having a bit of knowledge on<br>large-scale infrastructure development I<br>wanted to endorse the comments about the<br>lack of capacity in the country it is<br>really real and the reason for that is<br>that almost every developed economy<br>around the world is going through a 50<br>and 100 Year replacement of Civic and<br>National Assets of the same nature that<br>we're trying to deal with so the skills<br>for those kind of projects are in sharp<br>demand everywhere so uh that's number<br>one number two is that the large-scale<br>companies DaVinci's the the all those<br>big companies you know of the Spanish<br>the French<br>Etc even the Aussies<br>will always still rely on the local<br>capacity to deliver those bits of<br>infrastructure so they'll fly in the big<br>big guys uh he'll come and and tell you<br>that they can do it then they'll turn<br>around and call on a local capacity to<br>build it now I don't think we've got<br>enough capacity to look after what we've<br>got let alone do the big jobs that need<br>to be done so I think we've got to be<br>real about that it comes back to the<br>immigration story again<br>and so I think one of the most important<br>things we can do and this is something<br>that Simon and I sort of worked on a<br>while ago years ago was we need to get<br>in behind the infrastructure commission<br>30-year Pipeline and we need to look<br>across both New Zealand and Australia<br>and try to build scale across those<br>things and I'll give you some examples<br>Imports is one but tunnel boring is a<br>great example so watercare has a tunnel<br>Boring Machine drilling the tunnel<br>through Auckland we need to have the<br>next tunnels lined up right behind it so<br>that team of Specialists can stay in the<br>country can continue on to the next<br>tunnel and the one after that one after<br>that we need to have that 30-year plan<br>with triggers against each of those<br>projects in a bipartisan way that says<br>we know what needs to happen and we know<br>what the triggers will be for each of<br>those projects and give that signal to<br>the market so the market can start to<br>scale up give the skills in the country<br>and start to plan and predict when those<br>those projects will get underway and to<br>me that is one of the most critical<br>things that collectively all of us can<br>should get in behind for the next 50<br>years of infrastructure development and<br>then immigration everything else needs<br>to follow behind that as well there are<br>answers and we know what the answers are<br>we just got to do it<br>can I just um I mean you're absolutely<br>right but just one thing to respond with<br>it I think<br>um we can come up with all the pipelines<br>in the world and the 30-year plans and<br>so on but if they're not integrated I am<br>worried that they don't go any further I<br>mean put it this way I I've I've<br>literally gone through uh over the last<br>decade every long-term plan from all<br>what was it 78 Council councils across<br>the country and pulled out their<br>infrastructure spend I've done the same<br>for all of the um other major providers<br>if it's a big Excel list of all of these<br>these are all the things we want to do<br>that's one thing but I do wonder if<br>actually we need to give infracom more<br>powers to be more directional instead of<br>saying hey you know look if you're a<br>government Department send me a plan<br>about what you want to do and I'll track<br>it on a spreadsheet which that's not to<br>denigrate what infracom does but I think<br>they actually needed a bit of an ability<br>to say actually look no we've got the<br>taranaki hospital rebuild coming up we<br>need to put these other services<br>alongside it there's going to be a new<br>housing development in this area it<br>needs some sort of social provision<br>coming in as well we need to make sure<br>there's good electricity connections and<br>similar to the region I don't think<br>we've got that level of integration at<br>the moment I think that's even if we<br>solve all the other issues you<br>effectively have what you have in a<br>number of parts of the country where you<br>go from a four-lane highway to a<br>two-lane road and all of a sudden<br>everyone wonders why there's roadblocks<br>and similar we we don't seem to sequence<br>stuff properly it's the same as the<br>tunnel boring example I'm sure there are<br>some tunnel boring machines that New<br>Zealand has bought and then sold and<br>then rebought again because we needed it<br>five years later so so that has to come<br>with not only the money the resources of<br>people but actually a a bit more of a<br>directional function not the old town<br>planning if you will of yesteryear but<br>an ability to say no not your individual<br>view counts but actually here's a<br>collective view of how we're going to<br>integrate infrastructure and get<br>everything going at once because at the<br>if one of them was a party that wasn't<br>in favor of the thing I think what I<br>thought at the time though was that it<br>would be a more authoritative body that<br>would be giving us a sense that pipeline<br>plan not not exactly<br>um as we all knew he'd be room for a bit<br>I think unfortunately it just hasn't<br>quite moved out that way and that's not<br>to denigrate the infrastructure<br>commission I think the chief and Seeker<br>than border you know some people and<br>they are doing some good<br>quotes and good work it's just it's not<br>quite doing<br>um what we thought it was going to<br>we're going to shift to housing now<br>there are two or three questions that<br>have come through<br>um<br>and there's sort of the nature of<br>housing that is being built so there are<br>questions about whether we have a<br>genuine housing shortage or whether we<br>have a shortage of affordable homes<br>um do we expect much for what we can<br>afford to pay are we building two bigger<br>homes in some places are we gold plating<br>everything Chris I'm going to start<br>again with you but others please jump in<br>okay well the most cost effective<br>housing you can build<br>and I think this goes for the<br>infrastructure that goes with it is is<br>Greenfield small lot single story single<br>dwelling homes<br>and I think you have a lot of<br>politicians who look at the<br>the planning Rose you even say oh no<br>let's not do that let's densify or<br>intensify the areas that are already<br>urbanized and the problem there is the<br>infrastructure current code the pipes<br>don't cope with what's there now and<br>we've seen that pretty wholeheartedly in<br>the last two or three weeks and to<br>upgrade the infrastructure in those<br>areas means digging up the old pubs and<br>putting new ones in which is at least<br>double the cost of building Greenfield<br>and then just the share cost of building<br>a building up and in a condensed<br>area is about almost double or more than<br>double the cost of building single story<br>Greenfield homes so if you really want<br>to make it affordable unfortunately<br>people don't always like this but the<br>fact of the matter is you have to build<br>Greenfield and you have to build single<br>story then you have to build small<br>smallish Lots with smaller houses on<br>them I think you know we got very used<br>to big houses and big backyards in New<br>Zealand but the the whole thing just got<br>too unaffordable so if you're really<br>going to make it affordable to everybody<br>you know you'd be surprised what you can<br>accomplish in 100 120 square meter house<br>and if you put some good Central Parks<br>and Central Recreation infrastructure in<br>you'd be surprised how happy your family<br>can be on a lot between two or 300<br>square meters inside<br>Tanya<br>how this housing Accord is working<br>really well for us is we now have the<br>aspirations of ewe who are significant<br>landowners<br>um you couple that with the<br>infrastructure acceleration fund from<br>the government that helps to support the<br>council's infrastructure and all of a<br>sudden we're all working together so<br>instead of it just being a hope and a<br>dream of private investors or ewe to<br>build homes we're actually saying okay<br>what's the infrastructure that Council<br>has planned for needs to plan for can<br>and can't afford and in government<br>please come to the table because we are<br>ready and waiting we just don't quite<br>have enough money and we've already seen<br>the progress on that and another example<br>is some of the land that Council may<br>have that is severely underutilized and<br>actually costs a lot to maintain how do<br>we use that better as well so if it's<br>not appropriate for a playground or a<br>reserve then is it appropriate to look<br>at for helping with housing as well so I<br>think if you put together again making<br>it count all of the shared aspirations<br>and actually what we're about to do in<br>the door as well as a future a<br>development strategy which we have<br>30-year infrastructure strategies but<br>then how do we couple that with<br>infrastructure with housing and then<br>with General Community growth we are the<br>new schools and hospitals or even<br>cemeteries going to go in the future and<br>I think that by working together because<br>we've heard it for years and years and<br>years and we hear it with government<br>agencies we all work in silos and we<br>don't talk with each other now the<br>housing according toshura has been a<br>perfect example where we're breaking<br>through those barriers we're saying we<br>don't have an option anymore we need to<br>and we're actually starting to see a<br>ripple effect through Council agencies<br>but also government too I'm seeing a<br>guest lecture on the housing Accord for<br>Rotorua coming at the waikato management<br>School very soon<br>look up I I think it's important not to<br>write off the the level of attached<br>dwellings on the country because um if<br>you discount them then apparently half<br>of the new builds in this country aren't<br>happening you know that's just not true<br>so attached dwellings are very important<br>the literature is quite clear on on how<br>much the densification uh is is<br>contributing across the country so I I<br>think it's important to to have that on<br>on record I think I mean in terms of a<br>part of the question I think Matt was<br>you know what is the actual shortage<br>well you only have to go as far as to<br>seeing social housing waitlist to get a<br>clear example of the absolute bare<br>minimum if you will across the country<br>but one one one thing that does come<br>through in this that I think is is<br>worthwhile noting for the future because<br>part of this is about the future<br>considerations that we have is what do<br>we do in the future when we have by 20<br>uh 68 another million over 65 year olds<br>but only 600 000 odd 15 or 64 year olds<br>we know that people as they age require<br>housing in a different way I'm and I<br>don't have any particular answers of<br>this but I think one question we need to<br>grab with as a country probably globally<br>needs to be how does our housing evolve<br>over time to go from bigger houses to<br>smaller houses you know because<br>increasingly we're building uh we've got<br>a lot of houses across the country but<br>increasingly I don't know if we're<br>building the right stuff in the right<br>places that's probably more the question<br>that comes forward you know in in the<br>future how do you transform a four<br>bedroom home into a one bedroom is that<br>possible uh and and because increasingly<br>we are going to see that people are<br>living uh in different ways they're<br>living longer they're going to require a<br>different level of service so there's a<br>question over not only what we're<br>building right now and do we have enough<br>but do we have the right sort of housing<br>stock for the future is an open question<br>that I'm not going to answer here but I<br>think it is something we've got to<br>Grapple with<br>thank you sure so I just want to add a<br>small point which is really valuable<br>because I think we've been talking big<br>scale but if you actually look at little<br>scale mum and dad or first home buyer<br>and what we can help to what we can do<br>to help assist them as well and the<br>medium density changes that actually<br>came in<br>um enabled us for people who have the<br>traditional kiwi big house on a really<br>big section that can actually use the<br>limited assets that they do have that<br>land to either subdivide and put on up<br>to three dwellings on that one section<br>now or actually what we've seen many of<br>the consents coming through it or<br>shoulder council at the moment if people<br>are now putting a minor dwelling on for<br>their child or for their parents so that<br>they can actually afford to have an<br>affordable home as well so I think we<br>need to be smart about<br>um how our families practically do it<br>but how we can support those people with<br>limited investment and assets to<br>actually make the most of it<br>you Christian Jim Christian uh on<br>housing why don't we invest in modular<br>housing in New Zealand the Scandinavian<br>countries who topped the list of<br>everything that happens in the world<br>just about 87 percent of their houses<br>are modular homes<br>we insist on building every house<br>separately and more expensively why is<br>it that the industry hasn't moved to<br>what is a cheaper option but a perfectly<br>equal option in terms of a home and<br>they're just absolutely surprises me on<br>that but the other point I just want to<br>support Brad on we just are not still it<br>goes back to my earlier point we're not<br>looking at the future of society and<br>what the housing needs are of tomorrow's<br>society and tomorrow's Society is not<br>that far away that we will need and I<br>think that right keep it up because that<br>needs to be done but go back to modular<br>you can't believe that you won't have<br>um the short answer is we don't have<br>enough scale here in New Zealand to<br>build it efficiently and and<br>they are but they can they can have<br>factories that can deliver all over<br>Europe if they're cost effectively we<br>don't have a market beyond our own and I<br>think I think many people have tried and<br>we've certainly tried<br>um the transport costs are very high<br>here the transport difficulties are high<br>just the logistics of getting these<br>things around the place but but moreover<br>I think the foreign companies and some<br>of them have been Scandinavian that have<br>come here have tried but they<br>they sort of end up going back home and<br>saying well there's just not an export<br>Market the local market isn't big enough<br>and there's no export Market to tap into<br>so it just doesn't quite support the<br>infrastructure you need to make it work<br>which I think is a great shame because<br>ultimately when I've been up there and I<br>have done it a couple of times and<br>looked at the way these factories work<br>and the efficiency with which they build<br>houses and then you come back home and<br>you see the bloke in the back of the Ute<br>and his dog in a nail bag and been a few<br>bucks puffing on a cigarette and<br>drinking a coffee it's it's like a two<br>out of ten versus a nine and a half and<br>it's a real shame but I just<br>I'd love to think that flitches are<br>trying it and I'd love to think they<br>could make it work but I I I've seen<br>others try and go back with their tails<br>between their legs it just doesn't seem<br>and Chris does have a Scandinavian wife<br>so he has been alive yeah yeah yeah I<br>have done it a few times all right I'm<br>going to go<br>I think when you remember as well that<br>um we need to think uh what's the big<br>picture where's the supply chain and<br>when we are surrounded by forests here<br>in New Zealand I know we've got plenty<br>in the Central North Island but then we<br>go and cut down that wood send it all<br>the way overseas get it back once it's<br>processed at a really expensive price we<br>need to look at word processing plants<br>just as much as we need to be looking at<br>the people who build it yeah I couldn't<br>agree more yeah all right we have just<br>come through<br>horrendous weather events and it's<br>obviously Hawke's Bay it's up through<br>Auckland it's Northland it's West Coast<br>has been enormous uh impact<br>there are questions here about managed<br>Retreat Nicola Willis touched on that<br>earlier the questions about green cities<br>but what changes now what changes post<br>the cyclone and what changes as we go<br>into an expectation of Greater extreme<br>weather events what do we need to do<br>differently that maybe wasn't on our<br>radar even a few weeks ago around the<br>durability and resilience of our<br>infrastructure<br>to come<br>and goes um Branson<br>effects were interesting ones about the<br>the infrastructure investment and if<br>we're at a high I'm I'm sure that at a<br>level is absolutely right in terms of<br>the dollars being spent but I think you<br>know let's be<br>um a little bit cynical in as much as a<br>whole lot of that would have gone on the<br>likes of public transport subsidy on<br>consultancy and so on not the actual<br>bitumen and Tara and so on that we so<br>you take our transport investment New<br>Zealand the reality orbiters yes it's<br>increased year on year for a long time<br>we spend as much more as we ever had but<br>what we're spending physically isn't<br>quite as much so just to think there's<br>important context and then around your<br>question I certainly exceed you know as<br>much as it's a it's a nice catch phrase<br>there is something behind this bill that<br>better you know I think the vast<br>majority of us wanted to<br>his colleagues accepted except there's a<br>climate change thing and there's these<br>various other issues that are that are<br>that are going on that that are<br>contributing to this and so there will<br>be changed routes there will be<br>different designs but but I think in the<br>end it doesn't mean<br>Senior Transport perspective radical<br>change from what best practice was I've<br>already given you the example of State<br>Highway one to the north look actually<br>if you build them well at this sort of<br>practice today they will hold up very<br>well<br>to changing with<br>as the old dungas that we knew were old<br>dungas that happened and so I think kind<br>of just it takes a specular position<br>where you know I think we've got to<br>think long term<br>build these roads really well uh for a<br>hundred years albeit we know that we are<br>100 years cups comes much more quickly<br>than it used to and I think going back<br>to my point around that public<br>expenditure and the reality is the<br>people that will be cleaning up the<br>impacts of the Cyclone are the local<br>councils and the local communities so<br>when we are at the whim of central<br>government hoping that they'll bail us<br>out for critical infrastructure to get<br>our roads open to get our water working<br>again I think that that's where we get<br>to a really risky situation in New<br>Zealand where again we prioritize<br>usually based on population so what are<br>our ruined provincial areas like tight<br>after tea in the East Coast or like far<br>north how can we guarantee that they'll<br>be better off we can do that by making<br>sure that councils are funded to do the<br>can I understand I mean I think I was<br>interested after that the Cyclone came<br>through uh some photos that one of the<br>teams showed me of I think it was esque<br>Valley back in 1939 or 38 or some of the<br>very similar scenes in a sense so I<br>guess um I think a lot to the kapiti<br>coast where you know um there were<br>conversations around putting details on<br>them so that we know about uh what's<br>going to happen uh and and that was<br>ruled illegal and there was all sorts of<br>money being spent and similar I'm I'm<br>worried that unless the government makes<br>a very Swift and decisive call on what<br>the framework and parameters are around<br>you know manage Retreat even at a small<br>scale there<br>um we're we're just going to be destined<br>to sort of everyone doing their own<br>thing and and having no sort of<br>coordination that that's very difficult<br>because it sort of means that at some<br>point people will go back and do things<br>again and again I mean if you look even<br>at how people choose housing at the<br>moment they will look more at where<br>their school zone is than what their<br>flood zone is and that sort of<br>information isn't well utilized it isn't<br>well understood and it's certainly not<br>put out there proactively it's probably<br>the most difficult thing that people can<br>find so unless we have a decision made<br>on it now I get the risks of doing that<br>quickly I trust me I do but I think that<br>there are greater risks of just letting<br>everyone do their own thing there are<br>people's lives at stake at the moment<br>and livelihoods who are going do I<br>actually start the rebuild or not they<br>are in limbo until those decisions are<br>made they make the wrong call now and<br>government changes the rules on them<br>tomorrow they are in a very difficult<br>place so that has to be quick and I<br>think it does have to come down to the<br>those regions we'll talk about there is<br>simply no excuse for not moving very<br>quickly<br>the government has to move quickly<br>because the reality is there are<br>communities there are practical purposes<br>yet they they have very long circuitous<br>back routes they can take from practical<br>purposes those communities have had off<br>in their their Freight and uh supply<br>chain there's practically speaking if<br>not cut off certainly very much<br>diminished and so yeah I think what I<br>think says short-term long term but here<br>is a real case for urgency on this light<br>now that goes to the prioritization<br>right like State Highway one through the<br>brynduins that should be absolutely the<br>top of the priority list that should be<br>drop tools on other stuff that might be<br>maintenance but but that one needs to be<br>repaired the northlanders cut off you<br>know and you imagine if if we did the<br>same to other regions so I think we've<br>that has to be someone has to draw up a<br>list and it does have to include by<br>picking winners there you will have to<br>pick losers but if we've only got x<br>amount of resource of time and money in<br>a year to do something we've got to be<br>pretty strict at the moment with this<br>has to happen first and unfortunately<br>that means that other things have to go<br>on the back burner that's the whole<br>point of Economics is the trade-offs of<br>scarcity we this stuff is scarce and we<br>have to make a decision if we don't the<br>decision will be and is being made for<br>us all right we're going to wrap up with<br>a quick fire around<br>um and it does actually come to the core<br>of what you've touched on there this is<br>an economics Forum we're looking at<br>trade-offs and I said I'd come back to<br>prioritization<br>from your point of view and I'll start<br>it you're in Simon and move across um<br>what would be your priority and then two<br>lenses one what would be the project you<br>would most like to see go ahead be at<br>infrastructure energy housing and also<br>what would be the system change priority<br>you would most like to see go ahead for<br>a longer term uh I was trying to be<br>really quick look in energy and<br>Communications actually off in the free<br>market New Zealand Works incredibly well<br>government sets the setting there's more<br>than enough Capital they get on do it<br>I'm not worried about those sectors and<br>by the way they'll they'll produce the<br>right environmental end so on<br>outcomes if they're left to it and<br>they're not interfered with too much I<br>in the end yeah housing I'll let these<br>guys deal with that that's a big one<br>obviously important and transport I<br>think right now there's literally five<br>State highways that need to be fixed in<br>the upper North Island if Government<br>needs to get on with that and then<br>outside of that look there'll be a a<br>scarcity prioritization process that<br>needs to be gone through I would hope<br>that actually political class and the<br>likes of the infrastructure commission<br>could kind of get together and not have<br>come by yeah but kind of get on and do<br>that great thank you mine's quite simple<br>it will be storm water I think we've<br>seen the impacts um with flooding and<br>not only the impact of the Cyclone but<br>stormwater is actually crucial for<br>ensuring that we can develop those new<br>homes so despite the increased weather<br>events that we do know are occurring to<br>unlock our Greenfield development for<br>the more housing for our growing<br>population we do need stormwater<br>councils cannot do that alone if we were<br>expected to fund that which we always<br>criticize for not funding it it would be<br>things like your public facilities your<br>pools your roads that would have to cut<br>off just to put those pipes to the<br>ground that you can't even see so storm<br>water please<br>Chris I think the one thing we've all<br>agreed on is there's not enough people<br>here to to do the infrastructure work<br>itself so from my perspective and I deal<br>with it every day until you build more<br>houses you can't get the people here to<br>fix the infrastructure so it's a it's a<br>very circular argument so I would say<br>you know let us get rid of some of the<br>bureaucracy let us spend some of that<br>150 Grand a block that we waste on<br>paperwork to do our own infrastructure<br>and build some more houses then you can<br>immigrate enough people to actually get<br>on and fix the trunk infrastructure<br>that's so desperately needed to be done<br>but until you can house them you're<br>still going nowhere<br>thank you Chris spread all of that my my<br>three if I if I if I had you know<br>unlimited uh Power one give infracom<br>more directive power so that they can<br>make those prioritization decisions and<br>and start put things forward two have<br>proper Asset Management plans across all<br>of our major infrastructure so that it's<br>not a surprise when they break<br>um and three where's the national skills<br>plan so that we've got enough water<br>technicians we've got enough building<br>Control Officers we've got those sort of<br>people I mean I can't tell you at the<br>moment how many nurses were down but I<br>know it's Lots I can't tell you how many<br>water technicians we're down but I know<br>it's lots and use that information to<br>then fund places pay people to go and<br>become water technicians because trust<br>me if you told me when I went to<br>University that I could pay my own way<br>and become an economist or get paid to<br>become a border technician I would have<br>would have chosen the second option<br>incentives matter here and if you put<br>people down that path uh you will get<br>the results that you want if you let<br>people do whatever they want without<br>that direction without the incentives<br>you will get a smorgasbord that might<br>not be the exact mix that you need I<br>suspect that all the water technicians<br>watching the live stream will be<br>contacting informatics about job job<br>swaps all right um I'll uh bring this<br>panel to a close um let's just put our<br>that's right thanks for it hey thank you<br>yeah either way hey thanks for that it's<br>all right<br>still on<br>am I yep I'm still microphone all right<br>uh one last<br>um a last comment from me is people um<br>as people start shuffling out of the<br>room uh first of all again an enormous<br>thanks to all of our speakers today<br>we've covered a wide range of topics and<br>it's in some ways pleasing and in some<br>ways unsettling to see the threads and<br>the themes repeating across them a<br>little bit of practical stuff some of<br>you are joining us for dinner tonight<br>that will be out the door to the right I<br>think we have canopies from about<br>quarter to six there will be a drink at<br>the bar there just out to the left right<br>now for those that want to stay whether<br>you're here for dinner or not some of<br>you might be going back to hotels and<br>then coming back in we start tomorrow<br>early bright and early check the program<br>there kick off breakfast and then Adrian<br>Orr into monetary policy have some<br>fascinating discussions then about<br>democracy in a digital age<br>how do all of these decisions come<br>together before a deeper dive into<br>monetary policy and on through the<br>morning so look forward to seeing you<br>tomorrow thanks again for fantastic<br>questions and engagement today and I<br>look forward to continuing the<br>foreign<br>campus the University of waikato is<br>building an Innovative and versatile new<br>facility designed to transform
