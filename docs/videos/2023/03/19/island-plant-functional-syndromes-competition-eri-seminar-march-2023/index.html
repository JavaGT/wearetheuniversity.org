Island biodiversity is also among the most threatened in the world, accounting for disproportionate numbers of species endangerments and extinctions, and invasive species are identified as a major threat. It has been predicted that island plants have evolved weak competitive abilities as a consequence of low species richness and the relatively mild climates of islands, making them easily outcompeted by more vigorous continental species that naturalize on islands. However, very little direct evidence via competition experiments or demographic analyses has been collected to test this idea. <br><br>We explore this predicted island plant syndrome using functional trait approaches, including a case study of leaf economic spectrum traits in native and non-native Hawaiian woody plants, and a global synthesis of island plant resource-use functional traits. In Hawaii, we have detected extensive variability in functional traits of both native and non-native species, with weak support for the prediction that island plants generally occupy the conservative end of the leaf economic spectrum. Moreover, trait differences between native and non-native plants are contingent on climate, illustrating the important role of environmental heterogeneity underlying island plant resource use strategies. Our future work expands to consider global patterns of island plant functional trait strategies, with explicit focus on links to environmental heterogeneity within and among islands, with the additional goal of predicting climate change effects on island plant function.<br><br>Dr. Kasey Barton is an Associate Professor in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa.

a<br>little darker I think that it will show<br>throw the<br>there<br>it's okay if we can't it just means I<br>think the people online can see it okay<br>just for three of you all right so<br>um Island plant functional syndromes and<br>competition so<br>let's see here how do we go forward<br>yeah so this is my first time I don't<br>know how to get this off the top do you<br>yeah<br>oh well<br>maybe okay uh so this is my first time<br>to New Zealand I'm very excited to be<br>here um just for a week this time but<br>next year I'll be coming back for<br>sabbatical<br>um Kate McKinnis and I are starting some<br>new research exploring how heteroblasty<br>potentially could constrain uh climate<br>change tolerance<br>um due to these sort of dramatic shifts<br>and form and function as plants grow up<br>um which are thought to have evolved in<br>response to predictable changes in<br>environments as plants grow up but are<br>perhaps becoming less predictable with<br>climate change<br>so that's sort of on the horizon but<br>we're not there yet so I have no data to<br>share in that regard<br>um so instead I'm going to be focusing<br>on some of the island plant syndrome<br>research we've been doing<br>so of course as you all are well aware<br>being on an island yourself<br>there are thousands of islands and so<br>the question is whether the plants and<br>the biodiversity that develops on<br>islands is potentially quite different<br>from and in predictable ways different<br>from that of Continental plants<br>so despite being super small islands are<br>really important because they Harbor a<br>lot of biodiversity both with respect to<br>biological diversity but also human<br>diversity in terms of language and<br>nationalities and this is<br>disproportionate to their land area<br>right so they're home to a really<br>dramatic and unique biodiversity as a<br>consequence of of high rates of intimacy<br>um they're also among the most<br>threatened ecosystems and habitats in<br>the world with disproportionate rates of<br>species endangerment and Extinction so<br>this biodiversity is at risk and and so<br>therefore important and useful to try to<br>understand the characteristics of this<br>biodiversity<br>so as a consequence of the high rates of<br>end ethnicity and the ways that biotas<br>develop on Islands the taxonomic<br>biodiversity is often really unique and<br>that's the consequence of dispersal<br>barriers which prevent some types of<br>organisms from colonizing islands and<br>then the subsequent adaptive radiations<br>that the organisms undergo that do<br>colonize Islands<br>and the results of this is that some<br>groups are underrepresented on Islands<br>compared to continents while other<br>groups are over represented leading to<br>this clear biotic disharmony so for<br>example in Hawaii we have only two<br>terrestrial mammalian species these are<br>two species of bats but on the other<br>hand from a single dispersal event we<br>have 125 species of lobeliads as an<br>example for plants uh for insects we<br>only have two native butterfly species<br>but over a thousand species of<br>drosophila so this is a really<br>interesting biotic disharmony compared<br>to<br>um Continental biotas<br>in addition to this taxonomic<br>biodiversity it's also been suggested<br>that there's unique phenotypic diversity<br>on Islands<br>and this for plants is usually referred<br>to as the plant syndrome the plant the<br>island plant syndrome<br>and the idea here is that Island plants<br>have evolved convergently on a suite of<br>characteristics in response to Shared<br>environmental conditions of the islands<br>have so for example these are mild<br>seasonality and Mild temperatures<br>because of the buffering effect of water<br>lots of high wind speeds and the<br>directionality of that wind can lead to<br>orographic rainfall relatively few<br>disturbances compared to comparable<br>Continental environments and all of this<br>is thought to have convergently selected<br>for sweets of plant traits that we can<br>recognize as the island plant syndrome<br>and these features include things like<br>being poorly defended against herbivores<br>because of that biotic disharmony in the<br>absence of some herbivore guilds<br>low fire tolerance limited seed<br>dispersal some reproductive traits as a<br>consequence of small population sizes<br>and relatively<br>deep operate pollinator communities such<br>as selfie self-compatibility generalized<br>fluoromorphology the mild climate<br>Society of selected for a lot of<br>secondary wittiness and low species<br>richness thought to have selected for<br>slow growing resource use strategies if<br>you haven't read this book evolution in<br>isolation by Casey Burns I highly<br>recommend it it's a really nice<br>discussion of all of these different<br>features that we think characterize<br>Island plants and the evidence that<br>pavers or does not favor them<br>and I've underlined the ones that my<br>lab's been investigating so we've we've<br>explored a number of these predictions<br>the one I'm going to focus mostly on<br>today is the slow growing prediction but<br>first I want to emphasize if you turn<br>that book in to the side you see it's<br>quite narrow it's a very small book and<br>I think that reflects the very limited<br>evidence we have for any of these Island<br>plant syndrome predictions so I would<br>say despite the fact that we often<br>describe plants with these traits as if<br>it's already a done deal<br>in fact we have very limited evidence<br>for them they're still at the stage of<br>being a prediction<br>and not at all A well-developed syndrome<br>quite yet<br>all right<br>so the island plant syndrome prediction<br>that animal plants are slow growing<br>actually stems from observations about<br>invasive plants so clearly we have a lot<br>of invasive plants established on<br>islands and we also clearly have high<br>rates of native plant declines and the<br>co-occurrence of these two things the<br>decline of native Island plants and the<br>abundance and spread of invasive plants<br>has led to the idea that those invasive<br>plants are simply out competing the<br>island plants and leading to their<br>displacement and this is used as<br>evidence for the idea that Island plants<br>are weak competitors as a consequence of<br>being slow growing and conservative in<br>however if you try to get into the<br>mechanisms of this it actually gets a<br>little more complicated so here's this<br>kind of logic chain that leads to this<br>idea<br>so at first Islands have low species<br>richness in general for plants this is<br>the case for comparable land areas<br>Islands do tend to have lower species<br>richness than Continental areas<br>that then is thought to have led to the<br>availability of empty Niche space<br>because of that low species richness and<br>that those unfield niches then have<br>resulted in Weak competition among the<br>island plants because if there were<br>strong competition they would have<br>filled all of that Niche face<br>that weak competition that we then<br>expect among Island plant communities is<br>that to have led to the evolution of<br>sort of slow resource use slow growing<br>competitively weak strategies which then<br>makes them vulnerable to fast-growing<br>vigorous invasive plants when they<br>establish an island and that that then<br>explains why not native plants often go<br>extinct or become less abundant when<br>invasive plants become established<br>that's the logic chain that people use<br>to explain this and there's a lot of<br>assumptions here and many assumptions<br>not well supported but there's sort of<br>two main things happening here which are<br>actually contradictory to each other<br>the first is undoubtedly well documented<br>Islands do tend to have lower species<br>richness and we also know that invasive<br>plants are well established and native<br>plants are going becoming less abundant<br>and going extinct those two things are<br>well documented the mechanisms that get<br>us there are not clear and actually we<br>have these two opposite predictive the<br>empty Niche idea is actually that<br>Continental plants establish because<br>there are empty niches and they<br>therefore avoid competition with the<br>native plants that's what an empty Niche<br>allows<br>the occupation of a niche without<br>competition<br>so by that idea we would expect no<br>competition between the Continental<br>plants and the native Island plants on<br>the other hand it's often discussed as<br>the Continental invasive plants are<br>vigorously outgrowing out competing the<br>native Island plants that's different<br>altogether that's the competition is<br>really driving this interaction<br>so these are the sort of two main ideas<br>that I think we are implicitly assuming<br>is going on but let's take a look at the<br>evidence for these<br>so diamonds naturalization hypothesis<br>can help us out here because this<br>relates directly so government's<br>naturalization hypothesis is the idea<br>that invasive plants are more likely to<br>successfully establish in places where<br>they're not closely related to the<br>native species already present and by<br>being unrelated we assume that they're<br>functionally different and therefore<br>encounter very little biotic resistance<br>so weak competition from the natives and<br>that allows them to establish into empty<br>niches that's the empty Niche hypothesis<br>on the other hand it's been acknowledged<br>that it's not just about biotic<br>interactions whether Continental plants<br>or invasive species in general can be<br>established because the environment also<br>plays a role so the conundrum here is<br>that Continental plants or invasive<br>plants are more likely to establish in<br>places where they're related to the<br>native species because that suggests<br>that they're already pre-adapted to the<br>environmental stressors of a place and<br>therefore can tolerate the climatic or<br>soil or other abiotic conditions so<br>there's the conundrum the invasive<br>plants are most likely to establish in<br>places where they're similar enough to<br>to be pre-adapted but not so similar to<br>encounter strong competitive resistance<br>by the native species yes so this is the<br>sort of two hypotheses in one idea<br>and Darwin's naturalization hypothesis<br>or conundrum is it's more commonly<br>referred to these days<br>is not specific to Islands people have<br>investigated this in lots of Continental<br>systems as well and usually it's done by<br>looking at the phylogenetic relatedness<br>between invasive and native plants or<br>other organisms<br>assuming that the phylogenetic<br>relatedness informs us about<br>potential Niche overlap and competition<br>which I think is a pretty big assumption<br>um for Islands we've recently reviewed<br>the evidence for this and found that<br>it's totally mixed it's sort of equal<br>amounts of Studies have found that<br>invasive plants are phylogenetically<br>more similar than expected by chance<br>or less similar than expected by chance<br>to the native species on Islands<br>um and so on Islands there's clearly no<br>strong evidence for the starman's<br>Naturalization hypothesis and I think<br>one of the big issues is that<br>phylogenetic relatedness may not predict<br>Niche overlap and competition for Island<br>and Continental plants which we assume<br>are predict to be functionally very<br>different as a consequence of these<br>different environments that they're<br>evolving under<br>so I think rather than using<br>phylogenetic relatedness as a proxy for<br>trying to make some conclusions about<br>the likelihood of competition we should<br>look at competition more directly right<br>and resource use to try to better<br>understand the role of competition<br>between native and invasive plants on<br>Islands as a way of trying to<br>investigate this prediction that Island<br>plants are conservative and so growing<br>so if we look at the direct evidence for<br>that the first the most commonly used<br>direct evidence for competition is<br>demographic data collected in the<br>context of natural communities and we<br>can then calculate the effect of<br>Neighbors on focal plant growth and vice<br>versa and that's a way of inferring the<br>competition intensity between<br>neighboring plants in the community<br>that's the way it's typically done we<br>don't have any of this kind of data for<br>Islands so demographic data are really<br>rare and especially in this community<br>context it allows us to disentangle<br>things like distance density size so we<br>really aren't able to assess this kind<br>of direct evidence which is sort of the<br>gold standard for examining competition<br>intensity<br>pairwise experimental tests are also<br>really commonly used to calculate the<br>intensity of competition between<br>neighbors especially if you're<br>interested in particular identities of<br>plants and their effects of competition<br>on neighbor growth and just as an<br>example there was a really nice<br>meta-analysis in 2016 where they<br>compiled all of this experimental data<br>1241 effect sizes looking at the<br>magnitude of effect of Neighbors on<br>focal plant growth and whether that<br>depended on the identity of the focal<br>plant and the neighbor<br>and what they found interestingly is<br>that identity really matters<br>so invasive neighbors strongly suppress<br>native plant focal growth but not vice<br>versa so native plants do not suppress<br>the growth of focal invasive plants<br>indicating that invasive plants are<br>really sort of<br>better at competing than the native<br>plants and this is a global<br>meta-analysis so this includes evidence<br>from lots of different places<br>and actually wasn't particular to<br>Islands but we saw this and we thought<br>well this would be a great resource for<br>seeing if the magnitude of this effect<br>is even stronger for Native Island<br>plants as we would predict if Island<br>plants are particularly weak competitors<br>even more so than native Continental<br>plants<br>at least mostly field experiments or<br>well field experiments glass house<br>experiments all kinds but experimental<br>approaches usually mostly yes<br>so we downloaded the data set of those<br>1241 effect sizes 62 were from Islands<br>so enough to work with<br>um the effect size they use is Hedges D<br>which is a magnitude of the difference<br>in growth for the focal plant without a<br>neighbor versus with an invasive plant<br>or some other plant competitor<br>a negative Hedges D indicates that the<br>plant grew smaller in the presence of a<br>neighbor that's consistent with<br>competition if it was a positive hedgesy<br>that would indicate that the plant<br>actually grew better when there was a<br>neighbor than without a neighbor<br>consistent with facilitation<br>so what we found is that across the<br>whole data set it did seem as though the<br>the effect of a neighbor was Stronger<br>for Island plants than Continental<br>plants as we might predict so that's the<br>top panel there<br>um but when we tried to investigate the<br>identity component we found that this<br>stronger effect on islands is actually<br>driven by native Native competition so<br>it occurred when it was a native<br>competitor suppressing a focal plant<br>growth that's where we see the the<br>strong intensity of competition and that<br>was marginally significantly stronger<br>than native competition and Continental<br>plants<br>um we couldn't actually test whether<br>invasive plants suppress native plants<br>more on islands and continents because<br>there's not a single example of one of<br>these experiments where an invasive<br>plant was paired with a native plant on<br>Islands among all of those 62 it was<br>only native Native or non-native<br>non-native competition it's clearly a<br>major knowledge Gap we simply don't know<br>what the intensity of competition is<br>between invasive and native plants on<br>Islands<br>those are the two most commonly used<br>direct approaches for measuring<br>competition intensity but it's becoming<br>increasingly common to use traits as<br>indicators of resource use and to use<br>these kinds of indirect comparisons of<br>functional trait analyzes to get at<br>whether we expect that to translate into<br>growth effects and competition intensity<br>so very commonly people use Leaf<br>economic spectrum traits so these are<br>traits that are involved in<br>photosynthesis and return on investment<br>of leaf tissues and this is thought to<br>then correspond to sort of the growth<br>Vigor of the plants and therefore we<br>infer could indicate the likelihood of<br>competition intensity so in general in<br>the context of invasion what we predict<br>is that invasive plants are more<br>acquisitive consistent with this sort of<br>high rate of photosynthesis but quick<br>turnover in tissues so for vigorous<br>growth<br>and that native plants would have more<br>of a conservative Leaf economic spectrum<br>strategy where they invest in<br>longer-lived tissues slower rates of<br>photosynthesis and that that could then<br>correspond to sort of a more<br>conservative slow growth strategy<br>that's our prediction that's actually<br>been quite well supported and lots of<br>studies done on continents<br>we've been examining this in Hawaii on<br>Woody plant species<br>so our question was really<br>straightforward our native Hawaiian<br>plants more conservative in their Leaf<br>economic spectrum traits than the<br>invasive plants established there as a<br>way of sort of indirectly trying to<br>explore the likely intensity of<br>competition<br>and the Hawaiian Flora is a really great<br>place to do this kind of examination<br>because<br>we have a lot of understanding of the<br>Native species and which species are<br>invasive and how long they've been there<br>about 90 percent of our angiosperms are<br>endemic so we have really high rates of<br>endemicity we have at current estimates<br>about 1500 native species that<br>Diversified from 259 colonists so this<br>is always sort of adjusting as people do<br>more molecular studies but about 1500<br>species and about the same number of<br>naturalized invasive species out in<br>natural areas so there's many other<br>non-native species that are planted<br>horticulturally but we wouldn't call<br>naturalized so there's about 50 percent<br>of the Flora and natural areas are not<br>native<br>there's also a long history of the<br>Hawaiian indigenous knowledge of these<br>plants and so we have a really great<br>understanding of their ecology and the<br>sort of ecosystem function of these<br>native ecosystems<br>so people have done lots of great<br>functional trait work<br>um on the Hawaiian Flora for various<br>reasons so we're really expanding on<br>previous work but we're trying to do<br>this in a much more comparative broad<br>sense<br>so we included a lot of species 87 Woody<br>species 55 native 32 non-native a lot of<br>the previous work focused on the<br>youngest island Hawaii island but we did<br>most of our sampling on Oahu because<br>that's where I live but we also did<br>sample on Hawaii Maui Kauai so we have<br>the four main islands represented<br>and importantly we really wanted to<br>focus on the the scale and the um<br>elevational gradients so<br>depending on how you're making these<br>comparisons between native and invasive<br>plants it really matters the scale<br>because a lot of times what we have is<br>that at low elevations there's much more<br>abundance and diversity of non-native<br>species than at high elevations and if<br>we sample them at just those places the<br>environmental conditions are also really<br>different so we might expect more<br>conservative growth strategies at high<br>elevation because of those environmental<br>constraints but that wouldn't have any<br>bearing on competition because the<br>plants aren't actually co-occurring so<br>we have to be really careful about this<br>species sorting across space and make<br>sure that we're doing these native<br>invasive comparisons at the scale at<br>which competition occurs which means at<br>the local scale<br>so this is often done at the archipelago<br>scale and we wanted to take into account<br>the species sorting so we did it at the<br>local scale but across the archipelago<br>and across environmental gradients so we<br>did capture these elevational gradients<br>that we know matter for resource use and<br>likely intensity of competition but we<br>only sampled plants at where they<br>co-occur where we could sample native<br>and invasive together and we're making<br>that comparison at that local scale so<br>across this elevational gradient we do<br>capture a lot of climate variability so<br>400 to 5600 millimeter mean annual<br>rainfall gradient this is a really<br>dramatic rainfall gradient and a 10 to<br>24 degrees mean annual temperature<br>gradient so these are really different<br>environments that we're capturing<br>and just as an aside we've actually like<br>done all this work to see if it matters<br>the scale so we've done the comparisons<br>at the local scale at the island scale<br>at the archipelago scale and also at the<br>species scale or incorporating<br>intra-specific trait variation and it<br>really matters<br>so we've found that the conclusions we<br>draw from these kinds of comparisons are<br>totally different depending on the scale<br>and whether we incorporate<br>intra-specific trait variation which<br>means that we need to be careful of that<br>and that's just currently in review<br>so this is a huge team effort it was<br>wonderful to spend all this time in the<br>field sampling all of these trees and<br>all of these amazing environments<br>I had a fabulous postdoc Andrea<br>westerband who was the team leader for<br>this and we had these three fantastic<br>graduate students Tiffany Kyrie and<br>kealoha who spent a lot of time out in<br>the field climbing trees and going<br>through streams and doing all kinds of<br>stuff<br>plus a lot of fabulous undergraduate<br>students and visiting graduate students<br>from other universities so doing this<br>kind of trade analysis is a lot of work<br>in the field and it's also a lot of work<br>in the lab when you bring the samples<br>back and we are processing them so<br>really this could not have been possible<br>without so many fabulous and really<br>so we were focusing on the leaf economic<br>spectrum traits because we have this<br>prediction that they directly inform us<br>about growth Vigor and therefore we hope<br>that can inform us about competition so<br>these are the ones I'm going to share<br>with you today we actually have about 20<br>other traits which are uh I'm not going<br>to share with you right now but these<br>are the sort of classic Leaf economic<br>spectrum traits<br>and of course the predictions going from<br>the acquisitive end which is what we<br>expect to see for the invasive plants<br>over to the conservative side<br>for the native plants<br>and we don't expect each of these trades<br>to be operating separately right so<br>these co-function as part of the leaf<br>economic spectrum so all of our analyzes<br>are multivariate so I'm showing you the<br>predictions for each trait but in<br>reality all of our analyzes are<br>multivariates<br>and here we go so we analyze this with a<br>redundancy analysis which is like a PCA<br>But it includes a constraining axis<br>because we wanted to test specifically<br>whether invasive and native plants<br>separate in this multivariate trait<br>space so that's our redundant axis<br>and it's a little hard to see with this<br>coloring the sort of like blue circle<br>and the blue dots are the invasive<br>plants and the black dots and the black<br>circle are the native plants<br>and the main conclusion is there's a ton<br>of trait overlap right I mean invasive<br>the natives are occupying the same<br>multivariate trait space and there's a<br>lot of this trade space<br>we do detect a statistically significant<br>separation with the redundancy analysis<br>I'm showing you the statistical test<br>there and you can see they do separate<br>just a little bit along this axis and it<br>is in the direction that we predict more<br>conservative for the natives more<br>acquisitive for the invasives but that<br>explains a very small proportion of the<br>variance right<br>two percent yeah<br>so this is one of those cases where it's<br>statistically significant but probably<br>same if we do species means yep<br>even doing like hurdles so that we can<br>account for differences in Sample sizes<br>same<br>yeah<br>um also there's a ton of variation in<br>these traits so it doesn't seem likely<br>that there's empty niches because the<br>island plants are occupying a lot of<br>trade space so what we're showing you<br>here is our ranges for these four traits<br>with respect to that original Leaf<br>economic spectrum data set which is the<br>glopnet data set which we can access and<br>for LMA we have among our native plants<br>64 of that Global range for<br>photosynthesis 100 of the global range<br>for nitrogen 87 and actually phosphorus<br>content among our plants exceeds the<br>extent of what's reported in glocknet so<br>these are Island plants that are really<br>functionally different even though it's<br>relatively few species so functionally<br>for us in Hawaii this isn't that<br>surprising because we sampled across<br>this huge environmental gradient right<br>so it makes a lot of sense that the<br>traits are going to vary dramatically<br>across all this environmental<br>heterogeneity<br>the important thing is that that<br>variation matters for the intensity of<br>competition across space right so we<br>can't generalize easily across space<br>because the functional traits are<br>varying quite a lot<br>and it turns out the differences between<br>Natives and invasives shift across space<br>so I wanted to get into that in a little<br>bit more detail<br>all this huge amount of trait variation<br>is linked clearly to the environment and<br>to climate in particular it's also<br>clearly linked to soils which we're<br>currently working on but the climate<br>piece we've already finished so I'm<br>going to share that today<br>for Hawaii we have really great<br>um<br>statistically downscaled and spatially<br>interpolated climate data and this is<br>specific there's people really working<br>on this hard because we have really<br>steep environmental gradients so to try<br>to characterize that they're really<br>great climate data<br>so this is all available in the climate<br>atlas of Hawaii you can download lots of<br>climate data<br>we downloaded actually about 45 climate<br>variables and then reduced them to the<br>ones that really mattered for<br>understanding the variation across our<br>sites and all of these we put into a PCA<br>and we come up with two axes that really<br>explain a lot of the variability among<br>our 45 field sites and these we're<br>calling the moisture axis and the solar<br>energy axis so the moisture axis<br>correlates best with soil moisture and<br>humidity and the solar energy axis<br>correlates best with air temperature and<br>potential evapotranspiration so those<br>are the two that we then put into models<br>with all of our trait data to try to<br>understand how this climate relate to<br>trait function and can that help us<br>understand potential differences or<br>detect differences between the native<br>and invasive plants<br>so I'm showing you just one example here<br>this is the solar energy axis and that's<br>photosynthetic rate and what you can see<br>interestingly is that the patterns of<br>how photosynthesis shifts as solar<br>energy increases is different between<br>Natives and invasive plants so for the<br>natives what we see is that there's this<br>increase in photosynthesis as sites get<br>hotter and drier but hotter and that we<br>see almost no shift for the invasive<br>plants and that this then leads to a<br>reversal in the kind of trait<br>differences so at low energy sites we<br>have that the invasives have higher<br>rates of photosynthesis which we could<br>then say maybe predicts competition<br>intensity for the invasives out<br>competing the natives but in these high<br>solar energy or low solar energy sites<br>we see the opposite pattern<br>so basically this comes down to cooler<br>sites the invasives are more acquisitive<br>hotter sites the native seem more<br>inquisitive and they Converge on similar<br>if we do this across all of our trades<br>and with respect to both of those axes<br>what we can conclude is that invasives<br>tend to be more acquisitive in the<br>wetter and cooler sites and that natives<br>tend to be more acquisitive in the Arid<br>and hotter sites and they like I said<br>converge in these mild climates and so<br>this likely implies or could suggest<br>that the intensity of competition if it<br>was driven by leap economic spectrum<br>trait strategies would also shift across<br>all right so if we take this back to the<br>context that I started with about the<br>empty Niche and the vigorous competition<br>um with our data set in Hawaii we would<br>say that we have no evidence of empty<br>Niche there's a ton of trait diversity<br>and a lot of trait overlap<br>and that it doesn't seem clear that the<br>invasives might be out competing the<br>natives through more acquisitive Leaf<br>economic spectrum strategies that those<br>differences are contingent on<br>environment and in complex ways so we<br>don't seem to have a lot of strong<br>evidence for this island plant syndrome<br>prediction that Island plants are<br>generally more conservative and slow<br>growing<br>but I think there's probably a few other<br>things that might be going on so<br>um one thing is that for it's<br>oversimplifying to predict that there's<br>any one factor driving native plant<br>declines right so a lot of times we do<br>focus on invasive plant competition as<br>being the primary driver of native plant<br>declines but in reality there's many<br>simultaneous threats and they probably<br>have really strong non-additivities so<br>we need to include competition with<br>other simultaneous threats<br>to investigate this and we're not doing<br>that in this particular study although<br>we have considered this in some other<br>things so it's not just competition but<br>could also be climate change invasive<br>animals invasive diseases habitat<br>second we focused on adult plants that<br>were already established in these<br>communities but actually I suspect that<br>seedling competition is maybe where most<br>of the displacement is happening and<br>this stems from field studies on Big<br>Island primarily where they're finding<br>that grasses really prevent native plant<br>seedling recruitment so in the forest<br>there's not a lot of grasses it's not<br>clear how informative that is<br>nonetheless it seems like this seedling<br>recruitment stage is where a lot of the<br>action is in terms of these potential<br>displacement opportunities and we are<br>aware of this I really like focusing on<br>seedlings so we actually concurrent with<br>that field study collected seeds and<br>grew plants up and measure the same kind<br>of traits for 43 of them<br>so we have similar kinds of data that we<br>can compare between the native invasives<br>at the seedling stage but we haven't yet<br>finally I actually think we got on a<br>tangent with the invasion piece right so<br>it's because this whole idea stems from<br>observations of invasive plants<br>displacing native plants on Islands but<br>Island plant syndromes are really<br>supposed to be about Island plants being<br>fundamentally different from Continental<br>plants that's a different question from<br>native invasive plant comparisons and I<br>think this is really important because<br>invasive plants are not a random subset<br>of Continental plants right there's lots<br>of evidence that invasive plants are<br>more acquisitive than native Continental<br>plants so detecting if we had detected<br>then invasive plants are more<br>acquisitive than native Island plants is<br>not evidence that Island plants have a<br>slow growing conservative resource use<br>strategy as part of Island plant<br>syndrome right because we're biasing our<br>approach we're confounding origin with<br>Invasion so I think a much better<br>comparison would be to compare native<br>Island plants to Native Continental<br>plants plants that aren't invasive<br>that's really what the island plant<br>syndrome is meant to be about<br>so that's what we're doing now<br>and this is part of a big Global<br>synthesis that I'm collaborating with<br>Claire fortunel on<br>um at AMA in Montpelier France so we're<br>synthesizing Island plant functional<br>traits resource use functional trades so<br>that we can characterize functional<br>diversity of Island plants globally and<br>so we can then compare them to<br>non-invasive Continental plants sampled<br>on Continental systems that to me is the<br>best test of the island plant syndrome<br>predictions<br>so this is in progress right now we have<br>about 14 588 data points in the database<br>so far our scope is global but we're<br>focusing on proper Oceanic Islands so<br>not other insular systems that our<br>Island like<br>um and sort of as a consequence of the<br>observation in Hawaii that the climate<br>and environmental heterogeneity is<br>really key for understanding functional<br>diversity our goal is to have this be<br>geospatial so that we can incorporate<br>the local conditions where the traits<br>were measured as another way of getting<br>at this island plant resource use so not<br>just kind of like Island as the only<br>Factor but also what's the climate and<br>the soil like of those islands and other<br>Island features like area and distance<br>to continents<br>um also we've observed that<br>intra-specific trait variation can be<br>dramatic and for Island plants perhaps<br>in particular because a lot of these<br>lineages are very young so they have a<br>lot of intra-specific trait variation<br>that may eventually correspond to<br>speciation but hasn't yet and so<br>ignoring that for Island plants is<br>um we've captured quite a lot of<br>diversity already so we have 1421 plant<br>species in our database from 158 plant<br>families so there's a lot of different<br>plants we've already got<br>where we see it we're taking data on<br>invasive species but like I said that's<br>not our real Focus it's really the<br>native Island plants compared to the<br>native Continental plants and we're<br>really just getting started only 16 so<br>um we're capturing a lot of diversity<br>geographically but there's still so many<br>islands not well represented right that<br>first figure of thousands of islands so<br>we're barely even there and probably<br>many islands don't have these traits<br>data collected or available and this is<br>something that's really tricky and we're<br>trying to to work with local scientists<br>and of course be very mindful of data<br>sovereignty as we're putting this<br>together<br>there's also major biases in the traits<br>that are represented so some traits are<br>really over represented like Leaf mass<br>per area you can't see that there<br>it's high though I wish I could see it<br>um max height and wood density so<br>together those three account for about<br>half of the very of the traits in the<br>database and then there's many other<br>traits that we have just in low<br>representation but we're taking<br>everything sort of physiological and<br>anatomical that's directly related to<br>Resource use<br>so<br>um one of my favorite kinds of traits is<br>leaf anatomy and those are very poorly<br>so our first goal is to characterize the<br>resource use trait space of Island plant<br>so this gets at the idea of empty niches<br>so are there empty niches among Island<br>floras we can do this statistically by<br>modeling the trade space and looking for<br>places in the multivariate trade space<br>that are empty right this can also help<br>us investigate things like functional<br>syndromes trait coordination and<br>modularity<br>multi-functionality among traits with<br>respect to different kinds of functions<br>light water mineral stress<br>um and specifically trying to<br>characterize functional resource use<br>trade space with respect to Island<br>features like climate Island age Island<br>area<br>Etc<br>that's our first goal is just to focus<br>on the island plants and characterize<br>their resource use trade space then we<br>want to compare the island plant trade<br>space to Continental resource use trade<br>space to see if Island plants are a<br>subset of Continental plants as we might<br>expect again for empty Niche hypotheses<br>or whether they kind of capture the same<br>extent of functional trait diversity as<br>Continental plants and that's also how<br>we can then test this idea the plant<br>syndrome prediction that Island plants<br>are more conservative in their resource<br>use than Continental plants and then<br>this is just always with synthesis it's<br>a it's a move towards more data<br>collection right so we're identifying<br>data gaps places where we don't have<br>much data traits that aren't well<br>represented<br>organs that aren't well represented root<br>traits are are really underrepresented<br>um and sort of be moving forward with<br>filling those gaps but in a very mindful<br>way that avoids helicopter science or<br>any issues with data sovereignty<br>and that's kind of where we hope this<br>leads eventually is to some sort of<br>network of Island scientists who are<br>collecting these kinds of traits in<br>similar ways for Island plants so we can<br>get a really robust synthesis and<br>characterization of Island plants but<br>led by local scientists so avoiding the<br>kind of uh colonialism that's sort of<br>impacted Island science for for so long<br>that's where we hope this goes<br>eventually<br>and so for that I'll thank you for your<br>hmm<br>sorry that was an extra site I took out<br>should I see if there are any questions<br>I was surprised to hear the tune I just<br>about museums or in a paper these are<br>going to review a teaching office<br>is<br>I think I know who it was oh in Hawaii<br>we use it all the time<br>what's the problem with it<br>what would be the problem with it<br>yeah<br>um it's a modernist way of doing<br>is<br>well I would need a little bit more like<br>rationale for that I think yeah<br>yeah<br>oh<br>okay Charles<br>hey Tracy this is a very interesting<br>talk<br>um I love that you had a really<br>hypothesis driven approach to the<br>investigation which I find<br>um really helpful in terms of<br>understanding<br>um the work and and although I was quite<br>intrigued because you know the way the<br>hypothesis was set up it doesn't<br>actually interrogate one scenario which<br>is that both are true<br>right and so I think you know when you<br>talk about the the island syndrome it<br>it's it's sort of implicitly says that<br>you know it's got to be this one<br>um over-encompassing Universal pathway<br>but of course biology you know I always<br>tell students that Evolution doesn't<br>select for what's elegant or what's<br>what's ideal Evolution selects for what<br>barely works right and so so what what<br>what do you think of that idea that<br>perhaps there isn't one granular Divine<br>Theory<br>one if I hear you correctly what do I<br>think about there not being one<br>hypothesis to explain this<br>yeah I mean obviously I think that<br>that's a very likely scenario in my<br>opinion the idea for Island plant<br>syndromes is way too simplistic for<br>exactly what you're suggesting there are<br>many different functional Solutions and<br>too much heterogeneity within and among<br>Islands to possibly expect that<br>convergent evolution has occurred across<br>Island Flores to me that seems<br>exceedingly unlikely which is why I<br>suspect we're kind of in the situation<br>right now where the more people start<br>collecting data on these predictions the<br>more we're deciding that they don't<br>actually apply and a great example of<br>that is anti-herbivore defenses is one<br>of these classic Island plant syndrome<br>predictions the last two meta-analyzes<br>to be published on this in the last few<br>years are like no we have no evidence<br>for this there are of course as many<br>Island plants that are well defended and<br>just lots of diversity within Island<br>Flores<br>so I think it's hypotheses are really<br>useful to frame a study but almost<br>always when we're trying to deal with<br>really big questions in a broad<br>Geographic scope it's never going to<br>come down to one one answer<br>yes<br>the native plants to<br>difference on a continent on how how are<br>you going to select comparable<br>um plans yeah I mean so we've taught<br>we've talked about this a lot because<br>there's there's the phylogenetic<br>component of relatedness there's also<br>are we sampling in sort of comparable<br>places in terms of their climate and Etc<br>and the island plant syndrome prediction<br>is that despite any of that<br>Island plants are fundamentally<br>different despite different environments<br>despite being phylogenetically related<br>or unrelated convergently they've<br>evolved down a different path so<br>theoretically we shouldn't need to worry<br>about that right<br>nonetheless of course we have a<br>phylogenetic structure in our in our<br>models so we can at least account for<br>some of that evolutionary history and<br>we're purposely collecting the<br>environmental data so we can again<br>include that the real tangle I think is<br>the Continental sources of data are<br>often not geospatial most of Tri is not<br>geospatial so actually capturing the<br>climate or environmental factors of the<br>comparative Continental floors is going<br>to be much harder because we're doing it<br>from the beginning for the island plants<br>it's going to be hard because we've<br>started trying to compile this to find<br>it for the Continental trait data<br>and I think it's because<br>people have just not been databasing<br>those features the way now I wish they<br>would<br>uh but theoretically we shouldn't need<br>are you using those<br>yeah yeah we we have that on our minds<br>yep yep no because we're still like<br>building the island one<br>I'm a little nervous about the<br>Continental comparisons like I'm most<br>interested in characterizing Island<br>plant functional diversity uh the<br>Continental comparison for these reasons<br>is like way harder I think<br>um so I've just set it aside for now<br>yeah<br>people are as many reports of things<br>as long as Ireland is um<br>yeah most islands aren't as Island as<br>Hawaii so we are this is why like<br>proximity and even now we're talking<br>about history of like you know paleo<br>history when were they connected things<br>like this because that's true for other<br>Islands too like Madagascar<br>that were treating as an island it's not<br>yeah so this is like<br>that that's this is again why to me<br>Animal Planet syndrome is too simple<br>because islands are themselves really<br>variable and have really variable<br>histories so why would we expect them to<br>all be the same of course they're not<br>the same<br>that explains the whole grind<br>it is in this song for one of my words<br>like some<br>with history and the nature of the<br>alarms involve in it substrate that they<br>colonized well that's the other thing<br>the assumption that low diversity<br>corresponds to low competition intensity<br>completely overlooks density<br>compensation right and you can get huge<br>abundances of within species organisms<br>that then leads to really intense<br>competition and also with low diversity<br>there's more likelihood for species to<br>co-occur in a predictable way to then<br>allow for the evolution of distinct<br>strategies to minimize competition<br>so some people have made the opposite<br>prediction that in low species richness<br>communities you should expect<br>competition intensity to have<br>led to disparate functions because of<br>this High likelihood of co-occurring so<br>I when I look at the landscape in Hawaii<br>it's super dense I I just assume of<br>now<br>now we need a lot of physical forms it's<br>a sort of Base substrate and then the<br>initial colonists yeah but it's been<br>like 20 million years right so like the<br>bare substrate yeah those populations<br>are young but on the old Islands no<br>those are old<br>and and they're just they're migrating<br>and colonizing the new Young Islands<br>it's not like a species starting brand<br>new there all the time<br>and so<br>yeah yeah<br>so I think you're probably right when<br>you go to like a very young lava<br>substrate the plant density is low and<br>maybe the competition is weak but very<br>close to that are old kipukas and just a<br>tiny skip away is an island with a very<br>old substrate so<br>on the landscape scale for sure<br>competition is definitely<br>reasonable<br>yeah<br>are there any other questions down here<br>no</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
