Many major developments have occurred since the industrial revolution resulting in many great advances in society. The basic physical principles remain unchanged even in our modern technological world with advanced computer based analysis techniques. However, in recent years there has been an increasing realisation that these solutions while meeting the physical parameters donâ€™t always address the problems they were designed for. It is now recognised that more information and a broader perspective is needed when undertaking designs to ensure they meet the specific rather than generic needs of the individuals and groups they are intended to serve. <br><br>To that end, a greater knowledge and understanding of changing population demographics and its changing requirements and priorities is needed as the basis of design decision making. This presentation will discuss the potential opportunities this approach presents and how it can lead to sustainable infrastructure solutions to meet the people of Aotearoa's needs and aspirations into the future. Examples of engagement with communities relating to these different demographics will be used to illustrate how this can be applied in practice.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

then we'll talk about<br>the future how is are we going to pull<br>these different seemingly like disparate<br>disciplines together to perform a better<br>so<br>especially uh<br>and I I pose these questions to our<br>undergraduate civil engineers<br>um I usually get fairly blank faces<br>so I think like me when I was an<br>undergraduate civil engineer<br>um they I do what civil engineering<br>actually entailed<br>so what's a civil engineer not civil<br>engineering what does a civil engineer<br>do<br>or very pertinent questions if you're<br>going to the vote for three or four<br>there's a little introduction about me<br>so I've already covered the details I've<br>sliced out of order isn't it okay so<br>moving on<br>you already know that so what is civil<br>engineering so when I was an<br>undergraduate first lecture on the first<br>day<br>lecturer providers with a picture like<br>this statement on it and asked us what<br>civil engineering was<br>um on memory I think I thought I wonder<br>if it's the art directing the great<br>source of power and nature for the using<br>revenge of man one bright spark at the<br>front stickers haven't said exactly<br>what's written there<br>he went on to become<br>top student in the classical memory<br>um<br>I think today might be pen for<br>plagiarism which is really out but<br>that's by the by so this is a<br>statement or a definition when the<br>institution of civil engineers was set<br>up in the early 1800s so<br>it's a<br>identifying what the object of a civil<br>engineer is in in broader terms civil<br>engineers are not military engineers<br>and traditionally the military engineers<br>built the roads built the towns built<br>Bridges<br>to enable them their armies to get to<br>the walls and we're not we'll get civil<br>engineers to do the same job<br>two key requirements quite quite tough<br>being a civil engineer there's only two<br>things you have to do first thing is it<br>mustn't fall down<br>so you have to make sure whatever you<br>make will carry on those that you put<br>upon<br>yeah so that may sound easy enough and<br>may interest you to know that in a<br>building like this it's a reinforced<br>concrete building<br>we use the strength of the concrete but<br>statistically concrete's a bit variable<br>so we'll always work on our 90<br>confidence limits<br>so that means at least 95 of the<br>concrete in the building is stronger<br>than what we design it to be<br>the other five percent gets that so five<br>buildings out of 100 may not be strong<br>enough<br>just to be on the safe side though when<br>we're working out what w is what loads<br>we'll assume we've actually got 50 more<br>than we expect<br>so if you've got a room full of people<br>we've only got 50 bigger people<br>rugby players instead of skinny students<br>or maybe we've scrammed 50 more students<br>into the space if we're trying to around<br>50 more rugby players into the space<br>than we could be in trouble<br>okay<br>then just to be on the safe side we'll<br>assume that once you've designed it it's<br>actually<br>stronger or not strong as we've designed<br>it to be so we'll make it stronger<br>physically<br>and that will get us to 99 of our<br>strength so that means only one out of<br>100 buildings will fall down so we're<br>much we're much much better space now<br>the other thing we have to do is make<br>sure it comes in<br>um at cost or under budget<br>and as a rule we're reasonably good at<br>the first one and typically two to three<br>times off the mark on the second one<br>so that was How I Learned civil<br>engineering that's what I did that's<br>what everybody did in those days you<br>didn't have computers to complicate<br>matters<br>so you envisioned you're standing on a<br>Hilltop<br>your<br>pattern and your glow vest surrounded by<br>your dirty doting under wings watching<br>your structure gradually arise out to<br>the ground<br>occasionally having to deal with some<br>minor issues that haven't been been<br>overlooked at the design stage<br>so this is civil engineering it's quite<br>easy<br>we build stuff<br>all the staff that makes Society<br>or hard infrastructure<br>if it's hard out of something we build<br>it that's that's what we do so<br>it's a very<br>inclusive very far-reaching uh<br>discipline<br>so we talk about hard infrastructure but<br>this is traditional civil engineering<br>which is<br>all the stuff that connects us where we<br>live where we work where we do what we<br>do<br>but in recent times you've started to<br>talk about soft infrastructure<br>the soft infrastructure is the stuff<br>that actually happens<br>within that hard infrastructure<br>this is the people the activities that<br>the people in the tank<br>and if we can't we design hard<br>infrastructure without taking that into<br>account then we're not going to get good<br>solutions to<br>people want<br>Society is ones that use it but need it<br>if we don't get it right then they can't<br>function effectively<br>so it's become quite apparent to us from<br>a designing point of view of civil<br>engineers but we're not just looking at<br>hard infrastructure and loads you've got<br>to look at interaction with people<br>so we change now from our two basic<br>requirements<br>for having to look at a whole load of<br>other considerations as well<br>and about environment culture we've got<br>to think about historical values we're<br>going to think about<br>Minor crises I think about legislation<br>there's lots and lots of additional<br>considerations which are all interlinked<br>or relate to how what we do relates to<br>and we need a crystal ball<br>we need to see the future<br>we're going to design stuff today it's<br>going to be built tomorrow last 100<br>years<br>you've got to have an idea of what's<br>where Society is going<br>and what's the future look like<br>pretty gloomy from some<br>analysts yeah<br>this has prompted a change in our<br>this is a recent<br>definition<br>S three words in that original<br>uh 1828 version<br>but it's subtly Alters the meaning<br>it means that civil engineering is much<br>more responsive much more aware of its<br>impacts how that will affect the<br>solutions<br>I asked my undergraduates this question<br>famous civil engineers I asked if they<br>know any famous people<br>TV personalities politicians pop stars<br>they can usually reel off the whole list<br>famous civil engineers<br>I asked that question and there's<br>usually quite a few blank paper faces<br>does anybody know any famous civil<br>engineers<br>why should you<br>there's a list of names this is the top<br>12 from the institution of civil<br>engineers but maybe one or two there<br>that you do actually recognize<br>um<br>and having identified those you'll see<br>that most of them are<br>18th 19th century uh<br>age there's a few more modern ones<br>and they're all famous for various<br>reasons so Brunel was a big Railway Man<br>um speeding was<br>it's in the lighthouse Eiffel heard of<br>him I hope<br>you also know that it's a Statue of<br>Liberty<br>so<br>so all of these are important for<br>various reasons uh this guy was around<br>at the time of the emperor hate trajan<br>in Rome so there was a lot of<br>infrastructure built there<br>some of these others quite prominent in<br>their time or specific things<br>get down to the bottom<br>notable by the fact that it's the only<br>woman on the list<br>anybody like to Hazard a guess of what<br>she's famous for<br>she's famous for being the first female<br>member I see she was chartered in 1927.<br>99 years<br>I mean<br>the institution was chartered<br>she was born out of Earth just under 10<br>000 chartered engineers<br>the reason I show this is because<br>1 out of 12<br>it's not far from move from where we are<br>today<br>and so when I was an undergraduate there<br>was four girls in a class of 80.<br>five percent<br>most of the classes I teach these days<br>have between five and ten percent female<br>representation<br>I think 20 of the graduates nationally<br>female<br>five percent of our chartered Engineers<br>the past populations came up<br>if we go back here<br>we're looking at being inclusive we're<br>looking at understanding<br>problems on a broad range of<br>perspectives<br>if we don't include Half the population<br>then we're limiting<br>so unless we uh change the demographics<br>there we've got to work more towards<br>that<br>inclusivity finding opportunities to get<br>more involvement more engaging we have<br>some research projects running currently<br>looking at what the drivers are what the<br>barriers are trying to understand<br>what process we can adopt to engage or<br>uh adverse genders into the profession<br>I personally think part of the problem<br>is we make it too hard<br>it's a manly thing and we feel that we<br>can do complicated maths that nobody<br>else can<br>um<br>and if you look at that image there's<br>very little maths involved<br>a lot of it's communication a lot of its<br>awareness a lot of its understanding<br>people<br>we find that<br>members of the opposite sex from my<br>perspective are a lot better at doing<br>that<br>engineering is not just about doing sums<br>it's about understanding communities<br>communicating<br>developing ideas so we need to<br>definitely engage with<br>okay so let's just think about changing<br>demographics uh I have to admit not<br>being a demographicist I had to I had to<br>Wikipedia<br>um but it did occur to me that our hard<br>and soft infrastructure divide does to<br>some extent reflect how population<br>demographics work and how they change so<br>we have sort of physical changes if the<br>numbers change the ages change<br>um so there's those measurable<br>quantifiable things and we've got<br>different activities of people undertake<br>so how they occupy themselves and then<br>we've got some of the more subtle<br>individual<br>characteristics that are more personal<br>and we have to recognize that there's a<br>whole different array of<br>um characteristics that we're looking at<br>and on the base of that what what is<br>changing how is it going to change and<br>what do we need to change in the way we<br>engineer the future<br>yeah so if we look ahead if we get our<br>crystal ball out polish it out and put<br>some new batteries in and try and<br>project where Society is going and where<br>it needs to be so what do we need to put<br>in place now to ensure that there's this<br>capacity that it meets the demands<br>we'll look back and ask a little bit the<br>pest is not a good indicator of the<br>future<br>but it does give us some ideas about how<br>things change this is a photograph from<br>a little place on the East Coast called<br>tokamora Bay if anybody's heard of it<br>let's just move a little bit short not<br>sound a little bit north of Gisborne<br>um so<br>in the early part of the 20th century it<br>was a booming Town local farmers built a<br>freezing works all their livestock was<br>taken freezing work for processing and<br>it was shipped out they built a big<br>Wharf<br>the time that wasn't very effective land<br>transform<br>population grew to over five thousand<br>range of meat workers so uh and service<br>Industries<br>to the second world war there was an<br>increase in land transport changes in<br>technology<br>a vocal processing guide area<br>so all that's left now is a few ruins<br>and a population of a few hundred people<br>so romantic change in demographics<br>first few hundred people<br>on a wide range of cultures age groups<br>and interests<br>one of the interests is<br>exploiting these ruins preserving them<br>preserving the history<br>rewriting their story creating a new<br>chapter in who they are their identity<br>what they want where they're going<br>there's a Young Generation as well they<br>see the recreational opportunities of<br>Leaping off The Wharf and fishing<br>the local Council sees potential for<br>Heritage tourism so there's a new<br>demographic there that's driving to<br>actually see if something happened to<br>these in a positive way rather than just<br>letting it decay and fall into into the<br>Dust<br>and recent events have also identified<br>that promoting networks not actually<br>that resilient or robust<br>so having facilities to use Coastal<br>shipping to supply these small<br>settlements actually<br>there's a an opportunity<br>but for some of these situations we may<br>be looking at a future where<br>it's less dependency on the traditional<br>transport and we shift back a few<br>generations to a different way of doing<br>things<br>so going back to our change in<br>demographics<br>as a historical snapshot with some<br>possible future connotations<br>but some sales some fairly obvious ones<br>when I Googled it you know these are the<br>ones that tended to stick out<br>regulation growth of which it's aging<br>and if you any of you've noticed but it<br>seems to be less and less old people<br>around and more and more young people<br>that's a that's a sign that we're aging<br>I think my mother observed it one of our<br>relatives passed away recently she's now<br>the top of the pile<br>the oldest one in the family so<br>she's looking down on us or<br>we also have digital disruption I'll<br>include this as a demographic driver or<br>changer<br>so what's population growth look like<br>population growth means infrastructure<br>growth we had to<br>accommodate people we have to provide<br>people with opportunities we have to<br>provide people with education so any<br>future growth has to as far as we're<br>concerned aligned to the UN sustainable<br>development goals<br>we need to be doing things the best way<br>we can and as sustainably as we can<br>if we look at that in terms of our<br>cities and communities what does growth<br>look like what's it going to look like<br>how can we manage the increasing number<br>of people make sure they've got places<br>to live places to work basis to to be<br>educated<br>a little history lesson<br>after the second world war in the UK<br>there was a housing shortage<br>partly because a lot of housing have<br>been destroyed during the bullying but<br>also there was a baby boom<br>during the blitz Lights Out it's very<br>dark they have to go to bed early what<br>do you do well strangely all these<br>babies appeared so we needed more<br>accommodation<br>between 1946 and 1947<br>they built a hundred and fifty thousand<br>homes<br>are just in the fall so a couple of<br>years which a huge number of homes to<br>accommodate those people replace a lot<br>of those damaged<br>um war-torn buildings<br>but it wasn't necessarily the best way<br>of doing things so in the 50s and 60s<br>you started to go to higher density<br>housing<br>it's a familiar situation<br>it's faster to build you can build lots<br>of them in a short space of time you're<br>making better use of space<br>going up rather than you know<br>and it should usually low cost because<br>you can replicate everything<br>economies of scale<br>you only have one roof on the whole<br>building not individual rooms on every<br>school<br>so basically it's a really<br>good solution<br>I'm an engineering perspective it's a<br>winner yep<br>we've met both of our parameters<br>stands up and it's<br>cost effective<br>there has to be a bit though doesn't<br>matter<br>okay but in this case<br>um somebody left the gas on and then<br>when they went to boil the kettle they<br>blew their kitchen out<br>which took down all the kitchens floors<br>below and Falls above people are not<br>happy and they get up in the morning<br>they go to make a cup of coffee and the<br>kitchen's disappeared yeah<br>so from an engineering perspective<br>yeah we didn't quite get the first bit<br>right<br>but what they also discovered here that<br>from a social perspective it wasn't a<br>good solution<br>people weren't used to being crammed<br>into a small amount of space<br>if you look in the background here you<br>can see the traditional housing Terraces<br>everybody knew their neighbors either<br>side everybody had a little bit of a<br>back Garden there was a bit of space<br>around Pocket car some Open Spaces sleep<br>kits<br>all of a sudden we<br>hundreds and hundreds of people into a<br>very small space<br>very little maintenance of all<br>maintenance and they just deteriorated<br>they were not a good solution the way<br>they were done aside from the structural<br>defense<br>and so we need to take this on board we<br>can learn from the pests and hopefully<br>not repeat those mistakes in the future<br>Works in some places don't get me wrong<br>but if we've got populations that are<br>accustomed to low-rise living it's quite<br>hard to convert and to high-rise<br>learning<br>so what's the sustainable living going<br>to look like<br>we grow in population we need more<br>infrastructure what does it look like<br>what is it we're providing<br>it's going to be fifth purpose<br>it's going to have to serve an aging<br>population<br>it's going to have to serve an immigrant<br>population<br>they have different requirements one<br>size does not fit all<br>where is it going to be<br>according to the U.N it's like 68 of<br>people will be living in urban areas by<br>2050.<br>the Google search 89 of new zealanders<br>live in open areas already<br>and there's suggestions that there will<br>be a deurbanization people will move out<br>to the big cities<br>especially if that aging population who<br>don't need to live and work in cities<br>we've all experienced disruptions from<br>covert 19.<br>realize that well we don't all need to<br>be stuck in the big city<br>yeah<br>big cities are a 19th century solution<br>the 19th century problems communication<br>into work between people<br>21st century we don't need to live and<br>work in the same places and we have to<br>think about the effect of natural<br>disasters as recent events have shown<br>how do we do it<br>we need to use sustainable material<br>sustainable methods what are they how do<br>just talk briefly about uh ourselves<br>in a few years time<br>actually I feel like that most days but<br>what do up aging population want what's<br>the aspirations and needs we're not just<br>build some more Hilda Rosses<br>oh<br>definitely more independent<br>some of them have more disposable income<br>but not necessarily or<br>they're not all going to need four and<br>five bedroom homes and so different<br>requirements<br>have possibly Less Mobile they need to<br>be in places where they have access to<br>those Services they need are maybe more<br>inclined to you to public transport how<br>do we ensure that that's available they<br>may need increased Health Care<br>they may want Assisted Living<br>and as we have an aging population then<br>the requirements of our medical<br>facilities may need to change may need<br>more specific facilities specific units<br>to actually do that so we've got a lot<br>of things to think about here so we're<br>not just thinking about putting roofs<br>over heads but I think about how those<br>rules are connected to the rest of our<br>where do we can live where are all these<br>people going to live this is a a<br>Wikipedia map sharing the population<br>distribution the the reddish bits of the<br>population densities<br>just in case you're not sure<br>you're there somewhere so most of our<br>population is very much concentrated on<br>a few locations<br>most of which are centered more close to<br>the coast<br>I'm sure we've all heard media reports<br>of<br>problems with sea level rise and how<br>that's going to affect our communities<br>we also have to think about<br>in the light of recent events or about<br>other natural disasters<br>where is it safe to build where can we<br>build that's actually going to be<br>suitable not just now but in 100 years<br>time<br>I'm not a statistician to be honest but<br>it's part of our teaching we have to<br>talk about probabilities when we're<br>designing things we have to think about<br>a likelihood of events taking place and<br>the consequences<br>so if we look at some basic calculations<br>most structures we'll talk about<br>designed either for 50 or 100 years<br>so if we're designing for<br>say 100 year flood<br>we need to know how likely it is that<br>our design will be affected by 100 year<br>flood<br>we'll see<br>natural sponsors how often are we going<br>to get 100 year flood in 100 years well<br>Bots really<br>except it's not that simple so we have<br>this relationship here you're not<br>mathematician apologies but basically<br>the probability of something not<br>occurring is given by that equation<br>so that means the probability of a one<br>in 100 year flood<br>not occurring in one year is 0.99<br>or 99<br>so that means there's a one percent<br>chance it will<br>what's the chance of it occurring in 100<br>years<br>so there's a 63 chance that a one in 100<br>Year flight will occur in 100 years that<br>means of the 37 sentient won't occur<br>but basically it's a two to one chance<br>it will<br>so<br>when we're thinking about one in hundred<br>years folks we're not thinking about one<br>event every 100 years<br>we could have two events in the next two<br>weeks<br>it's not a uniform distribution<br>if we take it to a bigger number<br>we've still got the possibility even if<br>it's a one in a thousand year flood<br>there's a 10 chance it will happen in<br>so what does that mean very simple terms<br>as an engineer who I design<br>move somewhere else<br>might not be the best place to put it or<br>if this is my 100 year flood do I make<br>sure that my floor level is up here<br>so we don't have to move away we just<br>need to design right to deal with the<br>situation<br>I used to live in Henderson Valley in<br>London<br>waitakere ranges<br>land I was on had a one in 50-year flood<br>risk<br>which means we've got about two<br>significant floods each year<br>at once every 50 years to a year and the<br>awards used to come out about that high<br>which is fine because my house was on<br>stilts up here<br>my lawnmower used to get wet and the<br>other stuff under the house but<br>house was designed to deal with the<br>environment<br>but we have to think about that when<br>we're signing our infrastructure for the<br>future we can't move everybody to High<br>Ground may not work but we can be smart<br>has anybody heard of this<br>climate change Commission<br>yeah so 2021 they issued this draft<br>advice for consultation so it relates<br>very closely to what we're doing but it<br>also relates to the population people's<br>Concepts their ideas their engagement<br>the environment has become a high<br>profile for a lot of people<br>and we need to be conscious of that and<br>we need to respond to that<br>this is what the climate change<br>that's it doesn't have anything to say<br>about construction at all it's all about<br>farming emissions and vehicle emissions<br>it's a bit of an elephant in the room<br>really<br>they ask for consultation from<br>engineering New Zealand and I submitted<br>this is an elephant in the room I can't<br>say anything about Construction<br>That's the Law building I think<br>now look clear closely you'll see the<br>cracks<br>so car instruction is responsible about<br>20 of New Zealand's emissions<br>so we can't ignore it we've got to do<br>something about it we've got to respond<br>to the population<br>society that wants action we've got to<br>respond it could be seen to respond<br>we've got to do everything we can<br>living in caves is not an option for<br>most of us anyway<br>concrete globally is responsible for<br>about eight percent of two emissions<br>the New Zealand concrete industry has<br>made a commitment to reduce emissions by<br>25 by 2030.<br>they were looking at off-centered<br>cements alternative processes more<br>efficient use of materials and so on<br>there's a commitment from us to do<br>something about it and they're well on<br>really opens up opportunities for<br>innovation<br>Engineers are supposed to be good at<br>this<br>if we know what you want we can engineer<br>it that's what we try and do<br>this moves us into the digital spaces<br>where we talked to mentioned digital<br>disruption earlier<br>so<br>let's fix that okay so this is the<br>future<br>inside if we've got this then<br>makes teaching a whole lot easier<br>because we can just plug a disc into our<br>students and they'll walk out knowing<br>all the information<br>uh somebody did point out that if we do<br>that they might be able to replace us<br>with robots as well<br>so there's a lot of technological<br>advancements in place and developing and<br>coming<br>in civil engineering we're looking at<br>what we call building information<br>modeling we're looking at construction<br>4.0 digitizing everything we do boarding<br>it spatially in digital worlds all of<br>our drawings contracts designs can be<br>digitized and stored all the processes<br>that we go through can be stored and<br>retained in a digital format<br>we also talk about virtual reality and<br>augmented reality what that means is<br>that for an average person<br>we can present them with a lifelike<br>image of our proposals they can walk<br>through the buildings we're proposing<br>without us having to<br>build anything<br>put on a headset or engage a program<br>which will allowance actually work the<br>way through they can see what it's going<br>to look like<br>they can say well that's no good because<br>people are in the wrong place<br>seats are in the wrong place the<br>entrance ways to now or too wide<br>and so we can engage more with people<br>it's also going to have a big impact on<br>our workplaces our education<br>and so what do are what will our people<br>be doing if we've got machines doing the<br>work that they currently do<br>means we've got to think about the<br>opportunities there what are the<br>educational requirements to meet this<br>future Workforce<br>if you need people who can maintain<br>robots we need people who can control<br>them program them and so on so it<br>changes the focus it changes the<br>requirements<br>opens up a lot of opportunities and a<br>lot of challenges<br>and there'll be a lot of people<br>sort of<br>luddites around in the good old days<br>will be the equivalent moving forwards<br>we already have robots being developed<br>the university here that will pick fruit<br>they'll replace the orchard workers<br>subsistence level income is for some<br>people<br>what's that going to do to our<br>population demographics<br>we have to be thoughtful of that as well<br>technology needs to be applied<br>a certain moral compass I think<br>it arises with some really useful tools<br>there<br>are following the Christchurch<br>earthquake the council collected<br>information from residents on what they<br>wanted for their Central City<br>and ask them to give all the stuff they<br>wanted to see with transport Open Spaces<br>public buildings we wanted to know what<br>people thought so they could come up<br>with a plan that reflected the<br>population they got hundreds and<br>hundreds of submissions<br>and it's not just not practical to go<br>through all those so here at the<br>University we developed an AI tool which<br>could go through those submissions<br>look for<br>keywords identify those link values with<br>a different hard and soft infrastructure<br>categories work out what the priorities<br>were in what people were looking for<br>well that's represented in this chord<br>diagram here on the left hand side we've<br>got soft infrastructure the right hard<br>infrastructure<br>different categories of those and<br>showing across linkages what's important<br>to people and that we can use when we<br>designing to actually come up with sound<br>Solutions are based on consultation with<br>moving to the future we have this<br>construction sector Accord so we're not<br>blindly moving ahead we have a<br>relationship a record between government<br>and Industry basically saying we've got<br>the job to do<br>we have to provide and continue to<br>provide the infrastructure for the<br>growing population for the changing<br>population we need to make sure we do it<br>right<br>we've got to look at what is important<br>in this sector Civic to New Zealand<br>we've got to look at supporting people<br>and communities both in the workplace in<br>the construction sector but also in the<br>community generally we have to produce<br>solutions that people want and need<br>you've got to look at making sure we<br>support our climate change and<br>environmental responsibilities<br>and we also want to have a productive<br>sector<br>is fairly low on the productivity<br>ratings we're going to look at ways of<br>raising that productivity so we're more<br>efficient more effective more cost<br>effective<br>you're going to be responsive as well<br>recent events have shown us that the<br>world is changing<br>potentially big waves we've got to make<br>sure we respond to those properly and<br>use the available data and information I<br>don't think when they wrote that they<br>actually were considering demographic or<br>population data I think that's really<br>vital to ensure that we achieve what we<br>I'll just sum up now so Society is<br>changing growth<br>we've got aging<br>urbanization<br>we've got lots of changes<br>visible or coming which we need to allow<br>for<br>and construction is changing as well<br>we're having to adapt we're having to<br>become more focused on what people need<br>more people focused and we need to<br>recognize that for us to do our jobs<br>properly<br>we need to have a clear view a clear<br>understanding of what the world or our<br>I</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
