bring the<br>the congratulations and welcomes from<br>the vice Chancellor and all the senior<br>leadership team to this wonderful<br>occasion to celebrate from motion to<br>Professor for uh Chris Holmes it is my<br>responsibility to just give you a brief<br>overview of the proceedings which uh<br>Professor Murray Ray is going to<br>introduce the speaker Chris is going to<br>speak and then Professor Palmer will<br>summarize before we get invited to our<br>staff club for Refreshments but also to<br>outline the significance of promotion to<br>professor at the University of otago the<br>achievements that are involved in give a<br>little bit of an inkling about the<br>special character that Chris has bought<br>to that promotion before the detailed<br>introduction<br>um<br>professorial promotion is the Apex<br>promotion in someone's academic career<br>it involves<br>the need for demonstration of<br>outstanding<br>abilities across all three and in<br>particular leadership across all of the<br>key attributes of an academic of of<br>teaching of research and of service and<br>in Chris I think as you will hear in the<br>introduction and through the lecture all<br>three of those have been um<br>met and fulfilled to a high standard we<br>use international referees to Benchmark<br>against the best universities worldwide<br>so we can be assured that all of our<br>professorial promotions are very very<br>well deserved what struck me in Reading<br>Chris's CV is his dedication to teaching<br>being a very popular and Effective<br>Teacher to research both through<br>dissemination in monographs and other<br>forms but in particular to his<br>dedication to postgraduate supervision<br>more than 20 PhD<br>candidates have been supervised either<br>directly or in collaboration through<br>Chris but also his dedication to ongoing<br>and connected engagement to his<br>profession through his ministry and and<br>using that professional engagement to<br>enrich his research and teaching but<br>also we trust that the the academic<br>activities are fed that positively into<br>his profession so<br>I'd like to now invite Professor Murray<br>Ray to give a more fulsome overview of<br>your your<br>um career to date that has led to this<br>uh promotion but in doing so I would<br>pass on the most hearty and heartfelt<br>congratulations of the university<br>community to this very very well<br>deserved promotion Christina Koto Tina<br>Koto Tina Kota Katara thank you<br>it is my great pleasure this evening to<br>introduce my colleague in the theology<br>program Professor Christopher Holmes<br>whose promotion to the professoria we<br>are here to celebrate tonight<br>Chris joined what was then the<br>department of Theology and religion at<br>the University of otago as a senior<br>lecturer in Systematic Theology in 2010<br>he came to us from Providence<br>Theological Seminary in Manitoba in<br>Canada we had he had been assistant and<br>then associate professor of theology<br>he came with his wife Christina and two<br>daughters Lillian and Fiona and they've<br>since been joined by Marcus the Kiwi<br>born member of the family and to Chris's<br>family we are delighted that you're here<br>to share with us in this celebratory<br>occasion<br>Chris has been extraordinarily busy<br>since arriving at otago compiling a list<br>of achievements that amply justify his<br>promotion to Professor<br>the process of promotional University is<br>as Professor Blakey has indicated a very<br>rigorous one<br>it involves assessment of an academic<br>staff member's performance across three<br>categories teaching research and service<br>has achieved to use the technical jargon<br>sustaining sustained outstanding<br>competence and Leadership across all<br>three of those categories<br>I will not list all of his achievements<br>here but pick out a few highlights<br>Chris has been involved as again has<br>been mentioned in the supervision of 21<br>completed PhD theses and has another<br>eight on the go just now<br>he supervised 11 Masters thesis to<br>completion<br>plus a host of honors and other 400<br>level dissertations<br>such things are known as contributions<br>to the research environment<br>Chris's contributions have not been<br>limited only to postgraduate supervision<br>substantial though that is North solely<br>to the University of otago and its<br>students<br>he's been active in a range of<br>international collaborations notably on<br>the work of two giants of 20th century<br>theology Karl Bart and Dietrich<br>Bonhoeffer<br>both of whom also feature prominently in<br>Chris has also been very active in<br>research himself<br>alongside numerous Journal articles and<br>book chapters Chris has also published<br>six monographs the latest of which is<br>this work<br>I didn't bring any of the others for<br>fear of being charged on the bus on the<br>way home a fee for excess baggage<br>this book is hearing and doing the<br>speeches and acts and the essence of<br>Christianity<br>it is a measure of Chris's International<br>standing as a theologian that this book<br>will be the subject of a panel<br>discussion at the world's largest annual<br>Gathering of Scholars of religion and<br>theology in San Antonio Texas later this<br>year<br>two of his previous monographs have won<br>International book prizes and awards so<br>he has a widely read and deeply<br>appreciated author<br>in the area of service Chris has<br>likewise been extremely busy<br>he has served in the two most<br>substantial administrative roles in the<br>theology program being head of program<br>from 2019 to 2022<br>and convener of the postgraduate<br>research committee from 2011 to 2014.<br>he's also served in a range of other<br>important roles that maintain the<br>theology program as a rewarding and very<br>happy place to work<br>now given all of this one might think<br>that Chris hasn't had much in the way of<br>spare time over the past 12 years<br>but while coping with an intense<br>workload Chris has apparently found it<br>relaxing to run something approaching 50<br>marathons<br>he is indeed the Forest Gump of the<br>Forrest Gump is famous of course for<br>this Sage advice on the nature of human<br>life<br>my mama said his Forest laugh is like a<br>box of chocolates you never know what<br>you're gonna get<br>well Chris when we selected you out of<br>the box of applicants for the job at<br>otago we certainly got a good one<br>you really have been and are a deeply<br>valued member of the program and an<br>extraordinary contribution contribute<br>contributor to the life of theology at<br>the University of otago we congratulate<br>you on your promotion and we look<br>forward to your lecture this evening in<br>which you're going to consider two<br>foundational theological questions<br>what is Christian theology<br>and what is theology's business<br>you'll explore the basis and warrant for<br>theological claims and the nature of its<br>joyful speech about the reality of God<br>ladies and Gentlemen please welcome to<br>the lectern Professor Christopher Holmes<br>Tina Koto tenakoto tenakoto katoa<br>I'd like to begin this lecture with what<br>I think is the hardest part of the<br>lecture which is the acknowledgments and<br>thank yous it will it is well I suspect<br>that I will not get through this in a<br>composed fashion but I will try okay<br>so here we go I'd like to begin with<br>um<br>thank you first I'd like to thank the<br>academic party for their presence here<br>and support for Professor Blakey<br>Professor Ray it's very kind words and<br>for

you to my wife Christina for<br>your friendship love and sense of humor<br>I'm grateful okay there we go<br>okay<br>that wasn't so bad was it<br>all right so my aim in this lecture is<br>quite simple<br>uh first I'd like to make a few marks on<br>the nature of theology<br>answer the question uh or ask a question<br>what is theology second I ask what sorts<br>of things preoccupy theology what in<br>before I take up these two points let me<br>say a few words about how and why I came<br>to be a systematic theologian<br>by way of background I grew up on the<br>other side of the world<br>in the mid-sized city of London Ontario<br>Canada<br>my father was a high school teacher<br>my mom a homemaker who also taught piano<br>I have one younger brother<br>as a child and an adolescent I sense<br>that there was more to life than I could<br>see<br>I liked being outside especially in the<br>summertime<br>then as now in the emphasis is on the<br>word then then as now I enjoyed<br>um fishing<br>that's uh 29 years old that photo<br>the beauty and Order of the natural<br>world impressed themselves upon me<br>deeply<br>you could say that the god-shaped hole<br>Within Me<br>was growing ever greater thanks to the<br>gift of creation<br>at the age of 15 through the<br>encouragement of a friend I started to<br>read bits and pieces of the Gospel of<br>John<br>as many of you will know the Gospel of<br>John is one of four that we find in the<br>New Testament<br>it all also happens to be the one that<br>has consumed most of my intellectual and<br>spiritual energy<br>anyhow I found myself believing much to<br>my surprise that the things about which<br>John wrote were true<br>soon thereafter I started attending a<br>local Baptist Church<br>my engagement with scripture as a young<br>person anticipated what has become my<br>vocation<br>my vocation is out of a teacher of the<br>Sacred page of the Holy scriptures of<br>the Old and New Testaments I instruct<br>with a view toward encouraging loving<br>friendship with God<br>as many of you will know the Bible is<br>big and complex making many demands both<br>intellectual and spiritual upon its<br>readers<br>I knew that as a young person I wanted<br>to learn more about its form and message<br>that longing took me as an 18 year old<br>to a tuition free at that time anyways<br>Ministry training school in the United<br>States namely The Moody Bible Institute<br>located in the great City of Chicago in<br>though not everything I encountered<br>there was edifying a few professors<br>contributions were<br>one Professor was a historian of<br>Christianity the other professor in Old<br>Testament scholar<br>from the historian I learned something<br>of my spiritual you might say a<br>papa as a Christian<br>I met many theological ancestors in the<br>faith both Protestant and Catholic I<br>even became aware of some who lived and<br>wrote before the great schism in Latin<br>Christianity in the 16th century known<br>as the Protestant Reformation<br>notably I discovered a bishop of the<br>ancient Catholic Church named Augustine<br>Saint Augustine wrote and ministered in<br>an obscure diocese in hippo North Africa<br>hippo was in present-day Algeria<br>Augustine helped me as with countless<br>others throughout the ages to discover<br>why my heart was so Restless<br>my heart was Restless because it was<br>made for God and without God my soul<br>would remain forever adrift<br>from the Old Testament scholar I<br>encountered the Torah the first five<br>books of the Old Testament I also<br>discovered job the Psalms and the<br>prophets both major and minor from<br>Isaiah to habakkuk<br>upon graduating from Ministry training<br>College<br>I sensed a desire for further study<br>much to my surprise I ended up at<br>Wycliffe College an Evangelical Anglican<br>Seminary and Graduate School of Theology<br>in the Toronto School of Theology at the<br>University of Toronto<br>I went from a Midwestern American<br>Metropolis to Canada's biggest city<br>this was significant because Wycliffe<br>College was where my grandfather<br>an Anglican priest who ministered<br>amongst the indigenous peoples of the<br>Six Nations studied<br>just never know when these are going to<br>happen do you also my late father-in-law<br>a Baptist pastor to<br>largely german-speaking congregations in<br>Ontario and British Columbia studied<br>there as well<br>at Wycliffe College I discovered more of<br>the Christian tradition<br>while a master's student I had the<br>chance to dabble in the thought of<br>Martin Luther John Calvin and Carl Bart<br>among others<br>I also began to question the dominance<br>of the historical critical Paradigm for<br>reading scripture<br>that Paradigm has be though that<br>Paradigm has been chastened it was still<br>in Vogue in certain corners of the<br>Toronto School of Theology in the late<br>1990s<br>in the late 1990s there were folks who<br>really believed that you could find the<br>Jesus of history behind the Christ of<br>faith<br>the Christ of faith is what the church<br>throughout the ages has made of Jesus<br>taking hold of ancient Greek philosophy<br>so the argument ran the ancient Church<br>managed to take a poor wandering Jewish<br>sage and cynic and transform him into<br>God's son<br>then as now I thought that was<br>ridiculous<br>thus my desire to come to Holy Scripture<br>through the Christian tradition rather<br>than through Modern historical critical<br>biblical scholarship<br>my Master's thesis focused on Hans fry<br>the late german-american Theologian who<br>wrote a formidable study<br>titled the eclipse of biblical narrative<br>though my judgments regarding the merits<br>of Fry's argument have evolved over the<br>last 25 years I still think he was on to<br>something important<br>namely that theology must take seriously<br>the final narrative shape of the Bible<br>rather than trying to go to go behind<br>the text final form in order to find<br>some hidden core<br>but what next what was I to do on the<br>other side of a three-year master's<br>degree<br>was I to work in the church in full-time<br>Ministry or pursue further study<br>I sense that if I were I were to go into<br>the church it would be the Anglican<br>Church<br>well well I was a master's student I was<br>exposed to The Riches of African East<br>African Anglican Christianity<br>I had a chance to go to Kenya and to<br>serve in a congregation for a brief time<br>the experience in the Anglican Diocese<br>of bungoma was formative it showed me<br>something that's preaching there show me<br>something of the future of Christianity<br>that indeed the future of world<br>Christianity would in human terms be in<br>Africa<br>indeed the vast majority of the world's<br>Anglican Christians are found there<br>I was encouraged to see the<br>extraordinary spiritual fruit that the<br>church missionary society's mission in<br>the 19th century bore<br>in Kenya I also witnessed the so-called<br>African independent churches<br>African Christianity has thankfully<br>missed or had thankfully missed out on<br>the Enlightenment and so was at home in<br>parts of scripture that modern Western<br>people find uncomfortable<br>Jesus's exorcisms in the four gospels<br>Peter and Paul's raising of the dead and<br>the Acts of the Apostles the prayer of<br>the righteous person Healing The Sick in<br>the Book of James the ministry of the<br>Angels these were not awkward scriptural<br>moments<br>there was not any hard bifurcation of<br>the material and the spiritual to put it<br>in another way there was and is lots of<br>traffic between Heaven and Earth<br>anyhow upon completing the Masters I<br>didn't feel ready to serve in the church<br>in a full-time vocational sense as I had<br>a desire to go even deeper into the<br>tradition<br>especially to understand something of<br>what a noted scholar has called the<br>superiority of pre-critical or<br>pre-modern exegesis of scripture<br>in order to do so I needed money<br>I applied for a scholarship to Wycliffe<br>College a doctoral scholarship and was<br>awarded one my then fiancee Christina<br>and I took that as an affirmation that<br>God wanted us to pursue this path<br>thus the Deep dive into a THD the North<br>American THD is considerably more work<br>than its British counterpart the North<br>American THD or PhD requires coursework<br>then comprehensive exams and then the<br>thesis you only start writing your<br>thesis after about three years into the<br>program oh and you have to pass your<br>language exams as well German especially<br>was to come in handy it was a long and<br>tough slog if you finish you don't<br>finish until you're at least 30.<br>um I don't want to revisit those days by<br>any means as there was some considerable<br>mental Darkness<br>thankfully in the midst of that Darkness<br>I discovered the gift that keeps on<br>giving and that's distance running<br>was the instrument God used to get me<br>though I had as a master's student been<br>introduced to the writings of the Swiss<br>reformed Theologian Carl Bart my<br>doctoral coursework was represented<br>something of an immersion into his world<br>and the world of those formed by it<br>I suppose my second conversion took<br>place reading Bart's explosive<br>commentary published just after the end<br>of World War One in 1919 on the New<br>Testament book of Romans<br>through that remarkable commentary which<br>some of you I know have read Bart taught<br>me that theology involves listening<br>namely listening to God speak to us<br>through the Inc through the written word<br>of God<br>with a view to obeying in faith the<br>Incarnate Word of God the Lord Jesus<br>Christ<br>I was blessed at Wycliffe college and<br>the member colleges of the Toronto<br>School of Theology to have some fine<br>teachers<br>I had the privilege of studying with<br>some frighteningly erudite Roman<br>Catholic theologians through the<br>Catholic member of colleges<br>through conversation with the Catholic<br>theological tradition and a complete<br>immersion in the Theology of Bart I was<br>led by a Bart's commentary on Romans to<br>take up part parts of his uncompleted<br>massive and formidable Church dogmatics<br>which is there in part on the in this<br>slide<br>church dogmatics is without doubt the<br>most significant work of theology since<br>John Calvin's Institutes of the<br>Christian religion<br>Bart's dogmatics is so important above<br>all else because it's because of its<br>intense theocentricity<br>Bart is a theologian consumed by God<br>his two-volume doctrine of God I<br>surmised would be well worth exploring<br>in a doctoral thesis but where aware<br>does one begin and how<br>well thanks to the guidance of three<br>remarkable professors<br>I landed upon the Divine attributes<br>specifically the Divine Glory<br>after three years of coursework language<br>exams and comprehensive exams I was<br>ready to write about Bart's account of<br>God as he reveals himself in the Lord Of<br>Glory Jesus Christ<br>I was also prepared to wrestle with how<br>two leading German theologians and the<br>generation after Bart received his<br>doctrine of the Divine attributes<br>those theologians were abrahar jungle<br>and wolf died in 2021 wolf kraka is<br>still alive<br>though my judgments on Bard have evolved<br>over the last 25 years or so I remain<br>grateful for his work especially his<br>biblical work<br>as some of you know Church dogmatics<br>contains a lot a lots of fine print<br>therein he does one of two things he<br>either engages the tradition for example<br>the views of his reformed ancestors on<br>the scriptures<br>and it's Sports engagement with<br>scripture that I found that I found and<br>still find captivating<br>here was a theologian who like Calvin<br>Luther Thomas quinus and Augustine<br>before him understood himself to be<br>first and foremost an Expositor of the<br>Sacred page<br>further to this the best way to teach<br>bar to students I began to see was to<br>introduce them to his biblical<br>commentaries especially his shorter<br>commentary on Romans published in 1952.<br>the conviction grew and grew that the<br>most promising way to Foster student<br>engagement with a theologian is prolific<br>and daunting as Bart was through their<br>biblical commentaries<br>several years later I am thoroughly on<br>board with that approach when it came<br>time for me to write on other formidable<br>doctors of the Church Catholic like<br>Thomas Aquinas and Augustine<br>I began with their sermons and<br>commentaries on sacred scripture<br>indeed I started writing on Thomas<br>Aquinas by exploring his commentary on<br>John<br>the commentary is really a series of<br>lectures presented by candlelight to his<br>students at an awfully early hour of the<br>morning at the then newly established<br>University of Paris<br>upon completion of the THD I like every<br>other newly minted THD PhD worried about<br>the job market<br>I thought I would give adjuncting a year<br>try to publish as much from my thesis as<br>I could<br>continue to be involved in our local<br>Anglican parish and apply for whatever<br>academic academic jobs there were<br>assuming there were any<br>as it happened there was one job posted<br>that in Canada that year in Systematic<br>Theology and ethics I applied for it<br>interviewed was offered and subsequently<br>took it<br>there I was 31 and a half years old<br>yes and so my wife and I and our<br>three-week-old daughter Lillian<br>moved 2 000 kilometers or so Northwest<br>from Toronto Ontario to Winnipeg<br>Manitoba<br>now Winnipeg Winnipeg Winnipeg is known<br>for its brutal Winters among other thing<br>other things and there's something of<br>The Unofficial worldwide home of<br>Mennonite Christianity and all its<br>iterations<br>for four years I taught at Providence<br>Theological Seminary located in the<br>hamlets of otterburn population 40.<br>Audubon has a grain elevator<br>a post office or I should probably use a<br>past tense with a post office had a post<br>office and a curling rink<br>I was a long long way from Cosmo<br>Cosmopolitan Toronto but that time that<br>Providence Seminary was formative<br>I had an intense teaching load meaning<br>that I taught six Master's level courses<br>a year on major theological themes as<br>well as the history of Christian<br>doctrine it was baptism by fire I had to<br>become something that I previously<br>derided namely a generalist<br>when I was a THD student I thought that<br>I wanted to be a Bart scholar<br>as the years at Providence Cemetery<br>unfolded I realized that I am<br>temperamentally unsuited to focusing on<br>one Theologian for years let alone<br>decades at a time<br>what students needed and what I needed<br>was a sense of the whole Catholic<br>tradition<br>therefore the goal was to become<br>familiar with the whole especially the<br>church Fathers as well as and above all<br>else Saint Thomas Aquinas<br>while at Providence Seminary academic<br>opportunities started to appear<br>Elsewhere One was here<br>a theological friend of mine in Aberdeen<br>Scotland sent me in May 2009 the average<br>for the position here I applied on a<br>whim was brought down in September 2009<br>for an interview was subsequently<br>offered the post and decided shortly<br>thereafter to come<br>it was a bit daunting to say the least I<br>had only ever been to New Zealand to<br>interview my wife had never been here<br>and our families were and are in<br>Southern Ontario<br>I knew of the then Department of<br>Theology and religion at otago by<br>reputation as it had and has an<br>excellent research reputation abroad<br>and I was Keen to be part of a more<br>research intensive faculty that was also<br>Church facing<br>indeed I didn't want to leave behind the<br>forming of students for Christian<br>Ministry and service<br>though the university is not the<br>Seminary theology at otago has rather<br>remarkably preserved the trust of the<br>Christian churches throughout aotearoa<br>and indeed Polynesia<br>because I write teach and Minister for<br>the church I knew that up or I knew that<br>a post that was spacious enough to<br>provide for writing time and that served<br>the church as well as the common good<br>was not to be taken lightly<br>I'm thankful for the past 13 years<br>Otto Togo for being able to pursue<br>theological theology without reservation<br>and ecclesial and considerate<br>environment<br>otago has given me the space to learn to<br>walk with confidence and humility<br>through tracks of the Christian<br>tradition quite strange to Modern years<br>I began to discover in the early 2010s<br>Thomas Aquinas St Thomas Aquinas is an<br>exegete and rediscovered shortly<br>thereafter Calvin John Calvin as a<br>master Expositor of the Sacred page<br>together with them I moved back to<br>Augustine who for them and for myself is<br>influential<br>also Eastern patristics or fathers like<br>Gregory of Nissa Maximus Confessor and<br>John of Damascus have come much more to<br>the fore in my own thinking<br>they raise key questions for us<br>what does Scripture compel us to say<br>with respect to God<br>and what sorts of people do we need to<br>be if we are to receive that testimony<br>those two questions the god question and<br>the question of the shape of human life<br>in relationship to God animate me those<br>as with many others throughout the last<br>800 years I have found the writings of<br>Thomas Aquinas most helpful let me say a<br>little bit about Thomas<br>Thomas lived a full life for his time<br>living to The Ripe old age of 48.<br>Thomas taught preachers and he himself<br>was a preacher making his living by<br>begging and teaching other would-be<br>preachers to preach in the newly founded<br>Order of Saint Dominic<br>Thomas went to teach where his order<br>taught him to go<br>Thomas Aquinas was an itinerant teacher<br>University lecturer preacher and teacher<br>of preachers<br>he is the product or a product of the<br>Evangelical movement sweeping the 13th<br>century<br>Thomas's mind theological mind is its<br>own Universe there is great joy to be<br>found in contemplating little and I<br>emphasize the word little little corners<br>of it<br>I'd like us to go back for a moment 800<br>years in time and to reflect together on<br>the nature of sacred Doctrine with the<br>help of Saint Thomas<br>several keywords come to the fore in his<br>treatment of sacred Doctrine in question<br>one of his greatest work the sum of<br>theology these are words with great<br>scriptural and Theological density words<br>like God reason Revelation salvation<br>light and faith<br>sacred Doctrine Thomas averse is an<br>objective understanding inspired of God<br>and Tethered to the reality of God<br>sacred Doctrine focuses on the encounter<br>of human beings with the Living God in<br>Jesus Christ<br>Thomas recognizes that God has made us<br>for himself we have been created so as<br>to know God and to love God truly<br>pursuit of the knowledge and love of God<br>that is the point of sacred Doctrine<br>holy teaching indeed Christian theology<br>let me put this more strongly the point<br>of Christian theology is to nurture<br>loving friendship with the Triune God<br>but how can we know God given that God<br>surpasses our reason how can we mere<br>mortals know and love ones so infinitely<br>greater<br>thankfully God gives us revelation<br>Revelation makes known certain truths<br>which exceed human reason that's a drug<br>to quote Revelation blesses us with<br>truth the truth about ourselves the<br>world and of course God<br>the truths of Revelation exceed reason<br>yes but they do not contradict reason<br>Christian faith is not irrational faith<br>is not about believing three impossible<br>things before breakfast to quote Alice<br>in Wonderland<br>faith is with her whole salvation<br>depends upon knowledge of divine truth<br>our Salvation in other words is bound up<br>with Revelation and Revelation teaches<br>us Divine truth<br>so what is theology's subject matter<br>what is theology preoccupied with<br>theology's business then is truth<br>revealed truth but how and where do we<br>receive truth<br>we receive truth through faith and Faith<br>rests upon the promises of God contained<br>in sacred scripture the Old and New<br>Testaments<br>amazingly the Risen Lord Jesus Christ<br>himself opens our hearts to understand<br>him in the scriptures this is his<br>promise and he thankfully is faithful<br>let me put this slightly differently God<br>exists sacred Doctrine assumes that God<br>is the one to whom human beings are<br>directed God is our creator sustainer<br>and goal God however transcends us<br>utterly so<br>thus we need revelation we need signs as<br>it were pointers to God and God's<br>purposes in order to truly know and love<br>God<br>is generous and good making himself<br>known by divine revelation<br>we encounter Revelation in two places<br>first God communicates himself to us<br>through what some have called The Book<br>of nature that is the natural world and<br>the moral law<br>second God speaks to us through the<br>Sacred Scriptures through the Old and<br>New Testaments without scriptural<br>Revelation the way of Salvation remains<br>or Peg<br>the key words in all of this namely God<br>reason truth salvation and Faith<br>warrants bear careful biblical<br>consideration<br>theology's task is to know each of these<br>key concepts by the light of divine<br>revelation<br>in the case of God for example scripture<br>instructs us regarding what God is who<br>God is and what God does<br>God's light illuminates everything in<br>such a way that we may see things as<br>they truly are<br>accordingly theology is a Comprehensive<br>Science that means among other things<br>that nothing can be truly known apart<br>from God<br>I look out at you and what do I see I<br>see a people made by and for God<br>even more when I listen to the Tui that<br>lives in the rata tree outside the burns<br>building I am directed to Jesus who said<br>look at the birds of the air<br>this is what it means to know the Tui by<br>the light of divine revelation the Tui<br>simply by being what it is a Tui<br>declares God's goodness and Glory<br>not even Solomon in all of his glory is<br>clothed like one of these says Jesus the<br>Tui instinctively sings God's praise<br>the Christian faith challenges us to<br>regard all persons and all things by the<br>light of divine revelation<br>this means that when we listen to<br>scripture we hear from more than a<br>collection of ancient near Eastern and<br>first century Greco-Roman writings<br>knowing these writings by the light of<br>divine revelation means knowing them as<br>God's word as a medium through which God<br>communicates sacred truth<br>without the scriptures we cannot know<br>things by the light of Revelation<br>uh your word is a lamp unto my feet and<br>a light unto my path says the psalmist<br>divine revelation is indeed principally<br>found in scripture the inspired and<br>Living Word of God hence the need for<br>and the urgency of study of this or the<br>Urgent edives for study of the Sacred<br>Scriptures<br>as with many in the Christian tradition<br>Thomas leans upon Augustine for<br>theological insight indeed as Thomas<br>unfolds the nature of sacred teaching or<br>sacred Doctrine he quotes Augustine<br>here is a sample in response to the<br>question of why sacred Doctrine is<br>important<br>he notes that Augustine says to this<br>science and it's on the slide here to<br>this science belongs at whereas saving<br>faith is begotten theology gives rise to<br>Faith that is why it is undertaken<br>theology is in the business of<br>encouraging faith and trust in the<br>promises of the Living God<br>and what gives rise to Faith the answer<br>is simple the principles revealed by God<br>where do we find revealed principles we<br>find these principles in Scripture<br>scripture takes precedence and has<br>Authority because of what it contains<br>namely revealed truth this is why<br>unfolding the Sacred Scriptures is so<br>important<br>why then is sacred scripture the final<br>Authority for theology<br>scripture is authoritative because of<br>its author and the ultimate author of<br>Holy scripture is God<br>and God addresses God's people through<br>these writings thereby leading them to<br>Christ<br>in other words the Divine voice does not<br>compete with human voices<br>God's voice does not cancel out the very<br>human voices of the Apostles and<br>Prophets but their voices are annexed to<br>Gods their words are the word of the<br>Lord<br>if our hands are clean and our hearts<br>pure then we may hear the Lord's word<br>through their words<br>to be sure though our hands are rarely<br>clean<br>nonetheless we remember Jesus's words<br>blessed are the pure in heart for they<br>shall see God<br>and so stepping back for a moment what<br>have we seen<br>sacred Doctrine is chiefly concerned<br>with God who is a maker of humanity God<br>Matters Most<br>because God makes and sustains<br>everything except of course evil sin and<br>death<br>the things God creates and sustains can<br>be known through the Divine Light<br>as the psalmist writes in Psalm 36 verse<br>9.<br>for with you is the Fountain of Life in<br>your light we see light<br>the joy and duty of the spiritual life<br>is just this to attend to God's light to<br>that light as revealed in the Life<br>passion death resurrection and Ascension<br>of Jesus Christ and fulfillment of the<br>promises made to Israel<br>we discover the message of God's light<br>in Christ in sacred scripture the<br>Testaments contain the Revelation made<br>to the prophets prophets is a catch-all<br>term for the Old Testament and apostles<br>a catch-all term for the New Testament<br>the center of God's revelation is the<br>promise of God to bless the world<br>through Abraham's descendants in the<br>form of one who will reign on David's<br>Throne forever<br>accordingly sacred Doctrine is a deeply<br>theocentric undertaking theology's<br>principles then come immediately from<br>God by Revelation and Revelation<br>nourishes Faith so far so good<br>but what happens to us when we<br>contemplate the Deep things of God<br>well<br>um<br>I mean I just thought what happens to us<br>when we follow the Deep thing or<br>contemplate the Deep things of God when<br>we follow the one who is the way to God<br>Jesus Christ we become wise as Augustine<br>says wisdom is said to be knowledge of<br>divine things isn't that lovely isn't it<br>wisdom is said to be knowledge of divine<br>things knowledge of divine things makes<br>wise<br>the knowledge of God is deeply<br>transformative<br>knowledge of divine things and genders<br>faith hope and love<br>faith hope and love what some have<br>called the theological virtues are in<br>short supply<br>faith hope and love are desperately<br>needed in our in our families our<br>churches and in its institutions such as<br>this that serve the common good<br>therefore sacred Doctrine in particular<br>and Holy scripture in general has a<br>vested interest in what kinds of people<br>we are<br>do we have the habit of the virtues are<br>we being raised to the knowledge of the<br>truth<br>are we in the company of the baptized<br>learning loving friendship toward God<br>and love of one another<br>put in the words of second Peter what<br>sort of persons ought to you to be in<br>leading lives of Holiness and godliness<br>we ought to be persons pursuing Divine<br>things<br>knowledge of divine things is is<br>acquired by study yes but study assumes<br>prayer the sacred supper of the Lord<br>almsgiving fasting care for the least of<br>these<br>it's safe to say then that sacred<br>Doctrine is not about conveying<br>information<br>yes it is important to know for example<br>about the how and the why of the Monarch<br>the rise of the monarchy in Israel's<br>history yes<br>but much more than that the way of God<br>denotes a way of life that is<br>intelligible only within the context of<br>a community instructed by the proclaimed<br>word and nourished by Holy Communion<br>this is a pilgrimage expressive of the<br>faith hope and love of the Gospel<br>this pilgrimage pilgrimage involves<br>mortification and vivification of the<br>Flesh and attentiveness to the truth the<br>Crux of which is Christ himself<br>such attentiveness evokes faith for<br>faith is about God and faith faith makes<br>wise<br>theology matters because God matters<br>in unfolding this thesis I've relied on<br>Saint Thomas Aquinas<br>Thomas was what I aspire to be<br>namely a saint a love with God and in<br>love a saint in love with God and his<br>neighbor<br>such is the spiritual life loving God in<br>one's neighbor in relation to God<br>I'm deeply invested in the trinitarian<br>and christological metaphysics or first<br>principles that make this possible<br>but I'm not interested in them for their<br>own sake<br>rather I draw attention to them so that<br>folks might taste and see the goodness<br>of the Lord of apostolic and prophetic<br>truth<br>theology is a Comprehensive Science<br>treating God and all things as they<br>refer to God as their beginning and end<br>knowledge of the Divine things makes of<br>divine things makes wise<br>we know and love God by believing and<br>what we believe are revealed truths<br>embodied in the scriptural word of God<br>insofar as we believe in those truths we<br>fall ever more deeply in love with God<br>and learn to love our neighbor as<br>ourselves<br>sacred Doctrine assumes the truth<br>revealed to the apostles and Prophets<br>it is committed to them learning to see<br>all things in light of their instruction<br>theology also has to do with human acts<br>with virtue with the Contours of a<br>spiritual life<br>through virtuous acts we grow in<br>intimacy and loving friendship with God<br>and God's people in the context of word<br>and sacrament<br>there is indeed nothing better than God<br>writes Thomas in his commentary on this<br>homes that's worth repeating there is<br>indeed nothing better than God<br>happiness in this life and in the life<br>of the world to come consists in knowing<br>and loving God<br>we receive such knowledge of God in<br>faith by the scriptures of the Old and<br>New Testament<br>through the churches preaching and<br>teaching as well as its Ministry of<br>baptizing and celebrating the sacred<br>supper<br>folks learn to walk with the Living God<br>what is theology's business<br>theology's business is to lovingly draw<br>out the content of revealed truth as<br>found in Holy Scripture<br>theology's business is to inhabit the<br>truths of the great promise to Abraham<br>fulfilled in Christ and to lovingly<br>relate those truths to all things<br>insofar as theology does<br>does so it blesses<br>I hope that this lecture has been a<br>blessing too<br>thank you<br>I would like to conclude<br>then by saying the third stanza of the<br>theology programs<br>I resonate with it and think it provides<br>a fitting conclusion to tonight's<br>lecture so there's the Treo and then the<br>um<br>um I am the What's called the pro-vice<br>chancellor of humanities which<br>officially just means that I'm one of<br>Chris's bosses and my great privilege<br>tonight is to provide a vote of thanks<br>to Chris and to comment on what he's<br>shared with us this evening<br>I am not unfortunately a theologian I'm<br>a mere lawyer<br>but I am a fellow believer and it is<br>really lovely to hear Chris speak of<br>something that is so clearly deep to him<br>personally but to show us what it looks<br>like to be an academic bringing that to<br>life so Chris thank you for that<br>I think Chris has demonstrated several<br>really important and perhaps essential<br>qualities of an academic and his address<br>tonight<br>and I'm going to comment on five of them<br>first I think Chris shows an awareness<br>of a deeper and wider landscape that<br>travels both geography and time in which<br>one scholarship is a small but<br>meaningful contribution to the field<br>he talked about being in conversation in<br>dialogue with great theologians across<br>time and across countries and<br>geographies and and as Scholars that's<br>exactly what we are called to do to be<br>in conversation with those before us and<br>hopefully to play a part and continue<br>that conversation with those after us in<br>the fields in which we choose to make<br>our intellectual homes<br>I think secondly he showed us that good<br>scholarship takes much patience and<br>dedication and I heard a few gas when he<br>said he didn't draw his first paycheck<br>until he was 31.<br>and that is that is not an unusual path<br>for an academic particularly one in the<br>humanities and so Chris I want to thank<br>you for your patience and your<br>dedication to your call<br>thirdly he showed us that good<br>scholarship benefits from a dialogue Not<br>Just Between the thinkers and the<br>theologians and the researchers in the<br>field but also between the research and<br>the thinking and how to teach it and so<br>Chris Drew on his time at Providence and<br>told us about how a very a very heavy<br>teaching role in fact proved formative<br>to his scholarship<br>and although we're really glad that we<br>were able to offer you a home Chris<br>where you didn't have to teach quite as<br>much I'm nevertheless grateful that you<br>continue to see the importance of<br>teaching and that your students benefit<br>from the way in which you are thinking<br>out your area of discipline and<br>expertise with students as a joint<br>engagement<br>and so Chris remains a committed teacher<br>here<br>I also think that Chris demonstrated<br>that good scholarship has no natural end<br>point and I think that's a a truth that<br>our families probably find incredibly<br>frustrating at times but Chris you are a<br>dedicated and dogged scholar I would say<br>um you showed in your address to us that<br>your views have changed over time that<br>were you to write some of the things<br>you've written in the past you might do<br>them differently and that the way in<br>which you think and engage with other<br>Scholars and theologians has evolved and<br>I think that is a a really important<br>Mark of a scholar that your research and<br>your positions are not frozen or<br>paralyzed in time but actually that they<br>are partly formed by time so Chris thank<br>you thank you for continuing to take the<br>time to to revise to rethink to go back<br>to challenge yourself and in doing so<br>that you gift all of us with the beauty<br>of a continuing scholarship<br>and finally<br>and I think Chris demonstrates this in<br>droves<br>a good scholar<br>sees his or her work is not merely a job<br>but as a vocation and I think Chris they<br>said demonstrated that so clearly<br>knowledge for the sake of knowledge<br>would be apostasy for Chris he made that<br>clear in his address and he is doing<br>this for something far greater and far<br>deeper we saw this evening a scholar who<br>was convinced of and committed to the<br>truths of what he studies and who sees<br>his study and his work as a signpost to<br>something of far greater value<br>and although I get to stand here tonight<br>and say I'm a fellow believer and listen<br>with not just intellectual interest but<br>an interest of the heart<br>I'm pretty sure that all of our<br>colleagues in Takis aranui would say the<br>same thing whether they agreed or not<br>because that's the value of what we do<br>here is to think and learn and engage<br>with each other on what it is that makes<br>life and Humanity so important and Chris<br>has given us a really clear illustration<br>and demonstration of that so Chris it<br>takes confidence and courage to do what<br>you do in your everyday work but it is<br>absolutely a mark of a brave and<br>important scholarship in Humanities so<br>thank you Chris for what you do<br>foreign<br>I have the great pleasure is PVC to<br>present you with a small gift that's a<br>sign of our appreciation for this<br>evening and a marker that will be<br>and to all of you who've come tonight<br>thank you so much for coming thank you<br>for taking this time to be with us and<br>for those who might be watching this<br>either live or later on we thank you too<br>for joining us and for taking this<br>option to celebrate with us the um the<br>please join us and Chris and his whanau<br>in the staff Club it is a bit of a walk<br>from here so please don't be tempted to<br>just peel off because there's great food<br>and drink and a chance for a bit of chat</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
