of Wellington and<br>it's my very great pleasure to welcome<br>you to this event in the Provost lecture<br>series on University futures<br>it's a particular pleasure and I suspect<br>I'm not the only one in the room<br>to welcome our old friend uh an old<br>friend of mine an old friend of our<br>universities Professor Hugh Laura Hugh<br>it's lovely to see you back here in<br>Wellington<br>as New Zealand's globally ranked Capital<br>City University of course we relish the<br>opportunity to share our research and<br>thinking with the wider Wellington<br>community and it's also a very great<br>pleasure to have the opportunity to host<br>visiting colleagues to do this as well<br>and that's what we're here for this<br>evening<br>now this lecture series which I must say<br>has been an abeyance during covert it's<br>lovely to be in a situation where we are<br>beginning to come back together in<br>person uh but this was a lecture series<br>that was inspired by academics like you<br>who as a world-leading scholar is asking<br>crucial questions about the future of<br>universities<br>and what the series aimed to do was draw<br>on some of the best uh International and<br>National thinking to stimulate thought<br>and discussion I had the great pleasure<br>of having lunch with Hugh earlier in the<br>day and we're both agreed that our<br>sector not just this University not just<br>artillery New Zealand but our sector<br>more generally is going through a<br>profound period of qualitative change<br>and that question of what universities<br>will be like in the future and for the<br>now some of you I suspect will remember<br>you from when he was our inaugural dean<br>of Education here at taharanga Walker<br>and it's lovely to see some other former<br>deans of Education in the audience this<br>evening<br>today he is the professor of education<br>and political economy at the University<br>of bath and the United Kingdom where<br>he's been for over 20 years and he's<br>also a former director opposite<br>Institute for policy research<br>Hugh has given keynote presentations and<br>over 17 countries including the World<br>Bank in Washington the ILO in Geneva the<br>European Commission in Brussels and is<br>it's his second time joining us here in<br>Wellington as part of this lecture<br>series he was last here some six years<br>ago<br>Q is also the author or editor of more<br>than 10 thought-provoking books<br>investigating the relationship between<br>education and the economy and its<br>implications of graduate employment<br>he's given us a wonderfully provocative<br>title for tonight<br>capitalism and the fragmenting pillars<br>of Education<br>I've always found shoes observations on<br>the relationship of Education to the<br>economy absolutely fascinating and I'm<br>looking forward to hearing how we with<br>our connection to and our roles within<br>higher education can continue to<br>advocate for Progressive education for<br>our colleagues for our students and for<br>our communities and I'm sure you will<br>help us with that thinking this evening<br>so please join with me in welcoming<br>it's great to be back here I'm going to<br>take this off because this lecture is<br>going to be quite hot by the time I<br>finish not in a normal effect you<br>understand just because it's all been<br>here<br>um one of my years to give lectures<br>I used to stop because remember this<br>would be late 18790s this was the time<br>when the neoliberal when you were<br>experiment in New Zealand was governed<br>by a case and I suggested the students<br>this is a decisive term form in the<br>history of this country and of course as<br>we now know perhaps much of the Western<br>World well I hate to say but we're now<br>in a new age and we're now at the size<br>of Turning Point year and then but this<br>one is one where we're not careful<br>there's not going to be any way back in<br>other words there's a point to which<br>climate change and climate crisis and we<br>have some we're on borrowing time now<br>and we have some perhaps 10 to 15 years<br>to<br>um address this issue in a comprehensive<br>kind of way<br>so part of what I'm going to talk about<br>tonight is that and its impact on<br>education but there's a whole lot more<br>that we have to talk about and the<br>reason for that is that that debate<br>about climate crisis and climate change<br>has got caught up with a whole range of<br>other uh intersection intersecting<br>debates<br>and these intersecting debates relate to<br>uh the nature of what the Dignity of<br>what of wages a relation culturals that<br>seem to be present in many uh certainly<br>Western countries<br>animal related to the question about<br>whether the democracy is also on the<br>bottom time and those things have now<br>become into interwoven and what I Look<br>to do tonight is to disentangle some of<br>that while making the key point that<br>there are different forms of capitalism<br>which impact directly on what I'm going<br>to talk about which is these five 19<br>words of education so that and I'm sure<br>segment is what I'm going to be trying<br>to do tonight the purpose of doing it<br>this way<br>um is this<br>what I'm trying to do is to create a<br>space for what Wendy refer to as the<br>progressive education that we need<br>because what we'll talk about is how<br>education is being narrowed down to a<br>set of instrumental values related to<br>getting a good job which in itself is<br>not quite problematic<br>um so that's more or less<br>how I'm going to do it and having said<br>that I can now work through a couple of<br>more of these that's about time stuff<br>um<br>all right okay can you hear it goodbye<br>I'm thinking sorry<br>if I could reduce my voice a bit I mean<br>you know in terms of Facebook<br>let me let me talk about slowly then and<br>see if that works as well<br>um<br>so there are a number of points to be<br>made<br>um capitalism is not a universal unitary<br>and Universal system<br>um there are two ways which we can think<br>about capitalism one is that there are<br>varieties of capitalism<br>um and those varieties of capitalism<br>um are now often referred to as smoking<br>sheets which is the literature which is<br>superseded the idea that there are<br>different kinds of capitalism in<br>different parts of the world<br>um and the growth regimes themselves<br>vary in what I'm going to call<br>um the modes of capitalist accumulation<br>and sorting loads out it's going to be<br>quite important to the argument I'm<br>going to put<br>there's a political purpose in doing<br>this I'm not sure what's going to be<br>successful but I'll give it a go I mean<br>back in the 70s<br>those young Revolutions of which I was<br>kind of part of one uh in this country<br>was trying to get rid of capitalism<br>um and I wrote two papers<br>um in those days one was published in<br>Kaplan class and it was a revolution in<br>peace on universities and how they've<br>been trapped<br>um in the capital system<br>thank you for very different reasons<br>that still might be very true and true<br>um and the other one was a Social<br>Democratic piece based on kind of a<br>Nordic analysis of capitalism and I<br>looked at these two things and I thought<br>okay<br>um I can't hold both these things I've<br>got to move one way or the other and it<br>just don't happen that what your doctor<br>survived in New Zealand<br>um and on a political stage you have a<br>uh you have a little Revolution here<br>which became the kind of laboratory for<br>the rest of the world and I looked at<br>that Revolution and I looked at the<br>consequences of that and I thought I'm<br>not going to be a revolution<br>why how does that relate to the modes of<br>accumulation well<br>and if you ask me later I'll have to<br>tell you that I'm not very on Short<br>Round Here but different modes of<br>accumulation have different impacts and<br>I think if we can sort out the different<br>modes of accumulation and their impact<br>on education and being a wider Society<br>we might be able to<br>work our way through a more Social<br>Democratic position on this but I say<br>it's a bit tentative you know potential<br>um the modes of accumulation that I'm<br>going to be talking here<br>um the clearest ones and the most<br>traditional ones are those to do with<br>extraction and Manufacturing so<br>extraction is that of gas<br>uh oil<br>but then there are two more that have<br>become quite dominant and particularly<br>in the angry little<br>um Commons<br>um and they're to do with<br>financialization and rent seeking and<br>financialization okay I'm talking about<br>a number of different elements the first<br>is the strategy of Corporations to buy<br>back shares rather than<br>um<br>using it<br>um to invest in productive capacity<br>I'm talking about<br>um the hedge funds and the various forms<br>of<br>financialization where you get<br>profitable without productivity and<br>productivity is a huge question that I<br>know that the last time I said I talked<br>to your productive product of the<br>commission<br>um as it is everywhere else and it's<br>also to do with the plan which<br>um Banks<br>um lend money so that the majority of<br>the western world not all certainly not<br>Germany but the majority of the Western<br>World now is in POC I mean we're in debt<br>all the time large significant numbers<br>of large amounts of debt so that's a<br>shorthand for financialization direct<br>seeking of course starts with Remington<br>houses<br>um but it has now moved to intellectual<br>property bytes and the consequences of<br>the<br>um the rent again from being a monopoly<br>or knowledge Godly such as the<br>um tech companies in California<br>and the excess profits the super normal<br>profits that they make<br>and they're asking themselves got to do<br>with education I just hold on for a<br>minute and we'll work our way through<br>that<br>so<br>um<br>there are different performance of<br>practicing in the next event and as I<br>mentioned debate as to how much those<br>high-tech companies in California are<br>actually closing down emotion rather<br>than developing information the last<br>enough last three industrial revolutions<br>we've had there's been a diffusion of<br>innovation and this time it looks like<br>these Tech numbers it's an idea are<br>actually producing the amount of<br>innovation there is I I leave that up<br>with you that's just that<br>now in education most educations don't<br>talk about capitalism in terms of the<br>modes of accumulation they talk about<br>the Olympics<br>and there's a reason why<br>yeah look at this has done three things<br>for Education none of which I think are<br>very good but there it is the first is<br>to emphasize competition between<br>institutions and Fields of um<br>education the second is that<br>um we've tried to for example student<br>fees to create a market posts so that<br>the thinking of students is entirely in<br>Market terms<br>um and the third and perhaps the most<br>damaging thought is that the fundamental<br>purpose of Education under neoliberalism<br>is the instrumental one of getting a<br>good job<br>and that was intensely problematic in<br>your direction which we now live<br>but near liverless in general<br>is the funk person the front of<br>housefirst for captains and in places<br>through the<br>the lubricant the oil which makes those<br>modes of accumulation work<br>and I think that we need to set us back<br>from that funking house<br>and the same position as it were and<br>look at what's going on behind it so<br>that's what I'm trying to do tonight<br>so if we then move on there are two<br>underlying contradictions to that bring<br>all these different modes of<br>accumulations together and if you're<br>thinking well okay how does this work<br>under a Democratic Socialist politics<br>then you begin to see that might be a<br>problem because this binds binds up<br>those different modes of accumulation<br>um there's an option between the forces<br>and directions to production that's Karl<br>Marx uh and what's crucial about that<br>contradiction is that he said that there<br>will become a time and perhaps were at<br>that time right now<br>depends on how to interpret it and there<br>are many different interpretations of<br>this particular contradiction but it may<br>be that what we're now see is the<br>AI was superseding and chat GPT was<br>superseded some of what we would do in<br>the Next Room the work we do in other<br>words there is a question there is only<br>a question about how much<br>um Lane there is to be left once we've<br>got through this major Revolution and it<br>is only the question this huge debate<br>about that and the second<br>um that is between profit making and<br>life making and the interesting thing<br>about profit making and life making<br>Insight radical feminists during<br>feminists of 1970s were talking about<br>linking<br>um the issue of care that's care with<br>respect to Children caring respect to<br>all the people to the environment<br>and so that's what that's referred and<br>that is going to come through in this<br>quite importantly as well so you can see<br>on the central fighter uh<br>a lot of architecture a theoretical<br>architecture but I'm hoping that I'm not<br>just going to be cracking an island that<br>there's more to this than that leaves<br>the eye<br>then that point there is one of the<br>great New Zealand films uh therapeutic<br>tissues uh an analysts is really<br>important there what you don't<br>um<br>what you don't measure<br>um means that you're invisible an<br>absolute respect of caring but it's also<br>with respect to the environment but it<br>applies to both those things we don't<br>take into the cost of the environment<br>for any of the work that we tend to do<br>any things in corporations do we're<br>beginning to get a look at that right<br>now but whether it's too late it's<br>another matter<br>so the next thing I'm going to be<br>talking about looks like again pick up<br>sticks or a bunch of<br>shiny of<br>us that have been distributed randomly<br>um so bear with me<br>um let me see if I can do this<br>that's the notice of capitalist<br>accumulation so structuring and<br>Manufacturing is the obvious one and I'm<br>going to talk about that in terms of the<br>pillars of Education in relation to time<br>when it comes to knowledge and Truth<br>what we see there is that as a result of<br>um<br>financialization extraction and event<br>seeking but through the filter of<br>neoliberalism there's now fundamental<br>problem with<br>um the nature of the labor market and<br>the way in which it has fed into and<br>related to these questions of fake<br>um fake truth or fake knowledge or<br>alternative facts or whatever it is that<br>Donald Trump next speaks of<br>um but nevertheless that is a problem<br>and it's a problem now cleaning the<br>curriculum<br>throughout the Western world I said the<br>Western World The Anger from the world I<br>think<br>that is slightly puzzled by some of this<br>um then there's democracy and inequality<br>now the interesting thing is that with<br>the focus on education maybe not getting<br>a job<br>that one up there are many other names<br>of Education that there could be but one<br>of the fundamental AIMS in the past has<br>been on democracy citizens check for<br>democracy<br>and that is now gone very much into a<br>base but the Democracy in itself if it's<br>to be possible has to be in countries<br>which are relatively equal relatively<br>and what we find of course is that<br>there's writing equality largely because<br>of the polarization of income and wealth<br>and one of the<br>things that educations have not been<br>very good at is looking at vertical<br>inequality so they've looked at the<br>horizontal and important so that's race<br>class gender disability<br>um LGBT<br>forms of inequality but not there what<br>is the effect on education of that<br>polarization of uh income and wealth and<br>that's been far less of that<br>um<br>and<br>the problem is that when you get<br>um large groups of people who are in<br>poverty living in poverty you very often<br>find that they've stepped aside and<br>stepped away from the politics of<br>democracy uh because they're not getting<br>any benefit from it in any way at all in<br>fact the parties exclude them because<br>they're not big enough to be important<br>um so there's a fundamental problem<br>there and if what I'm talking about is<br>sorting through the literature and it's<br>not easy on<br>um Youth and political activity uh it's<br>very clearly if you<br>in literature about<br>um the relationship of positives of<br>democratic<br>activity but there's also one which says<br>not only in English poverty but young<br>people who have a kind of more<br>interesting authoritarianism than they<br>do demise it cuts both ways it's not<br>very clear but it seems to cut both ways<br>and then finally that's what I want to<br>talk about which is contribution<br>so in the past contribution<br>to see through paid employment<br>which of course we've already pointed<br>out a fundamental problems with that in<br>terms because there's so many other<br>forms of contribution but contribution<br>in terms of paid employment what I'm<br>going to suggest is that that in itself<br>in terms of a narrowly defined label<br>Market<br>um<br>needs to be reformed it just doesn't<br>work because fundamentally and in many<br>ways the labor market is now<br>dysfunctional and I'll point out some of<br>the questions case<br>so that then needs to be able to<br>the police of Education<br>the first one is the time and I want to<br>talk about time<br>then I want to talk about the biology<br>and Truth<br>democracy and equality and contribution<br>now<br>I'm going to do that in about 20 minutes<br>so you can see I'm going to be looking<br>through this sort of fair pace so I'll<br>just pick out some key points for you<br>notice that those pillars I didn't<br>notice that up because I'm not very good<br>at this stuff so I've Got a Friend<br>actually in Germany to design these<br>things for me<br>um and I suddenly realized<br>um<br>and these look like the pillars of<br>knowledge and the pillars of Education<br>from Greek times<br>um so I thought well okay that's a<br>problem<br>um so then I came across this work by<br>kiriana who's in fact a relative with my<br>partners<br>um and these are Cathy so these are<br>baskets of knowledge and this is<br>probably an entirely more appropriate<br>way of thinking about what is going on<br>um and this was the basket of knowledge<br>which have been torn apart<br>basic argument<br>so<br>um one other thing<br>very often people say an impact<br>Ministers of the ministries of Education<br>say you know education is to the degree<br>autonomous and what they mean what they<br>typically mean is something quite narrow<br>like one school can improve over another<br>in terms of some predefined outcomes<br>um and I'm not interested in that<br>because I don't think it actually stands<br>up very closely to the research but<br>that's not the point tonight but that<br>tells you that actually what we're<br>seeing particular mission to the<br>culturals I'm going to be talking about<br>in a minute is that<br>root there's a conflict between the kind<br>of person that we think we want to come<br>out of the education system<br>and it is always political it always is<br>a political thing and the culture Awards<br>as we're now encountering and clearly<br>demonstrates that I think<br>so no no need to say no except um this<br>of course it was quite conservative so<br>this is conservative thinking if you<br>so socialization the future of time<br>can I just ask you how many of you have<br>either said its teachers or have been<br>told as students<br>is very important<br>and it's important now and the<br>accessories tend to ignore it when it<br>comes to education<br>and it's actually quite vital<br>and time has a very particular role in<br>terms of capitalism it's always that<br>future time<br>and it's about a tool of surveillance<br>and you get that<br>um between<br>the 19th century and Amazon right now<br>they're what they're doing all the time<br>is checking and where do I put the<br>clocks<br>and then there's talk to people in the<br>primary schools and then it would seemed<br>that<br>students should be taught time Thrift<br>and this is a moral conjunction it<br>wasn't just a practical injunction it<br>was a moral conjunction<br>so<br>um time surveillance discipline<br>um and of course it's fundamentally the<br>engine of growth in the stock market<br>you're back on the future in the stock<br>market but if you're betting on Amazon<br>or you're betting on Uber you bet on it<br>now and you win because actually with<br>Amazon for a long time in our Uber for a<br>very long time no profit yet the shares<br>of high why because what they're trying<br>to do is freeze their competition out to<br>raise the prices in the future and<br>of course the reason why you've been<br>told and I've been told and I've said<br>um you're wasting my time it's because<br>what we're doing is time keepings with a<br>school bell and in terms of tests and<br>examinations<br>okay so here's the problem we're running<br>over time<br>and many students are aware of that<br>and what they're doing schools as well<br>as the universities is walking out of<br>the storms and lectures and classically<br>when um and Brett Dunbar has been one of<br>the key<br>features of one of computers about when<br>that happened in England<br>the Prime Minister<br>Theresa May said you're wasting your<br>time<br>very good<br>um but it's a problem<br>um<br>so in an international study now this is<br>from the universal Park but there are<br>many such studies of this kind<br>59 were extremely worried about climate<br>change 50 of students felt sad anxious<br>and angry<br>and so in other words the climate change<br>is an existential thing for students<br>so the idea that you can have a future<br>by getting your exams<br>is intensely problematic<br>what keeps students in that is nothing<br>to do with the climate and it's a crisis<br>there but it's nearly positional<br>competition or what Phil Brown calls the<br>opportunity to trap which is if you<br>don't play the game you get the exams<br>you're out of the game altogether<br>although your chances of getting a good<br>job are now in importance by the day<br>so<br>and that's compounded by mental health<br>problems caused by this positional<br>competition for preventions<br>um and I have two colleagues at five<br>Kerry Brown and Stan Carter do a lot of<br>work on the impact of exams on student<br>Mental Health<br>so what you've set up then is the<br>question what is the point and in the<br>Hickman study<br>um<br>that it was largely quantitative but<br>they followed it up across different<br>nations with political work and won the<br>students said well what is the point<br>so the question about education what is<br>the point everybody got 10 to 15 years<br>to address the musicians is actually<br>profound so that pillar of time so<br>Central to capitalist education is a<br>you come across it so Fiona Hills A<br>working class woman from the northeast<br>of England who<br>um by a series of actually calls it<br>Strokes of luck<br>um<br>got herself a degree from<br>Saint Andrews University in Scotland in<br>Russia<br>so fluent rush and then went to Harbor<br>that a Doctrine at Harvard and then<br>became the the expert for Bush Obama and<br>then Trump on the bus<br>and when Chuck was impeached she gave<br>over to Mr Dennison at the first<br>impeachment she's now looking hot which<br>is cool and there's nothing for you here<br>all the issues which now have Arisen in<br>terms of what we mild and culture is<br>um<br>the knowledge of the truth is not so<br>simple in the Democracy<br>um<br>they're intertwined with this power and<br>he's one of the great theorists of this<br>particular area<br>um<br>ethereum said that truth is like it has<br>a despotic character and when you think<br>about the active access<br>you can begin to see what was going on<br>there in terms of the idea of a despotic<br>character this is what the science tells<br>us climate change this is what the<br>science tells us<br>um so then there's a very interesting<br>short book by Sophia Rosenfeld which<br>looks at this issue of democracy and<br>knowledge and she has that quote though<br>which one is quite good<br>um for that<br>I'm going to move on<br>um I just thought well I'd better check<br>out what's going on here to make a<br>detail and that's just an example<br>um of the Human Rights Commission and<br>then the response from David Seymour<br>its racist history 26 days of seeking<br>occur the curriculum uh in this for the<br>English government guidance<br>um in terms of black lives matter<br>and the history of British Empire it<br>um so which I guess is kind of polemic<br>but anyway that's my view and that's<br>part of the life I live now we have a<br>slate of a statue of the slave to thrown<br>into Bristol Harbor and<br>it caused a shoe chuckle and<br>um in amongst the conservative<br>establishments in the United Kingdom<br>um people were thrown into jail because<br>of it but that group one of actually the<br>um the jury the found former<br>um but much of that goes on so this is<br>the cultural news<br>um<br>so and I'm going to come back to them<br>and look at the labor market because the<br>labor market is obviously the labor<br>market is trading one of the elements<br>which has caused the culturals that we<br>know of<br>um<br>the two further problems apart from the<br>one I've already mentioned which is that<br>um of polarization and political<br>inequality I've mentioned that and the<br>other thing is that the management<br>um for example in England in sorry in<br>Wales and Scotland<br>60 year olds can now vote<br>they have the vote in those two<br>countries<br>and they they live in institutions which<br>are highly authoritarian<br>I mean they talk about distributed<br>leadership as if this was some kind of<br>mental<br>um in educational institutions<br>um but<br>there's much more to be done in terms of<br>getting some kind of progressive uh<br>commitment from students through their<br>education<br>um which I guess<br>puts me around the 1970s in terms of you<br>know this is an intellectual such as it<br>is<br>um education contribution<br>um we have to structural labor models<br>the dysfunctional number of ways let me<br>just count them out the first is that we<br>now know that around 50 of graduates in<br>the United States in Britain for example<br>not sure what the figure is on here<br>um so they aren't adopted in terms of<br>um and it's much worse than that because<br>of course when we look at<br>um the bottom end rather than just the<br>top end you see so many jobs which are<br>highly insecure and the middle<br>jobs are also now going economists have<br>been recognized that far more than they<br>have the problem with graduates<br>um and chat<br>and a PhD students just send me a paper<br>today which says look at what this is<br>going to do in terms of jobs for little<br>managers in the middle<br>structure<br>so and then not only is there not a<br>problem that we don't take into account<br>anything that doesn't count so the<br>unpaid labor of care<br>for example<br>um the fact that we<br>there ought to be a charge for our use<br>of the environment but the very fact and<br>this came through in the pandemic<br>is that there are 70 jobs which are very<br>poorly paid but turn out to be<br>keyboarding jobs<br>um so there's a<br>kind of Gap huge gap between the market<br>and whatever Awards and what societal<br>needs are<br>and there's a fundamental problem with<br>all of that<br>um I said I wanted to talk about the<br>labor market in relation to<br>um<br>the cultural laws<br>pure research<br>um found that 36 of Americans have<br>supported the Republican party for your<br>colleges and universities were good and<br>um and the reason for that is because<br>there's a fundamental problem with<br>meritocracy which has now been<br>identified as being beaten over educated<br>um the status and the rules they get and<br>there are many people who have not gone<br>through universities or cultures and<br>golden states<br>who Clinic Fields some kind of<br>resentment and it's a resentment built<br>on the fact that we have Labor markets<br>which for those who are normally college<br>educated but I'm saying now also for<br>those in college educated that have been<br>flatlining in terms of wages in the<br>United States for a very long period of<br>time and in the UK for example since<br>2009<br>so<br>I'm just talking about the problem about<br>the single range of education for a good<br>job so what I've done here is try and<br>take you through time knowledge and<br>Truth<br>democracy and inequality and now<br>education and contribution to say that<br>in all these key areas of Education<br>there may be others but I find it hard<br>to understand what education is about if<br>it wasn't about these things<br>not understand anything else in all<br>these areas there are fundamental<br>problems that we unhealth in front of<br>um<br>that just explains that top bit there<br>just explains why there's such a<br>fundamental problem for graduates these<br>days work that I've done with Phil Brown<br>and colleagues on the global auction<br>Dave Ashman and then on the death of<br>human capital which is our latest last<br>book came out during the pandemic in<br>2020<br>fundamental problems about what they're<br>just arguments with jobs that's<br>basically the deal that's not human<br>capital Theory it tells you the exact<br>problems but that is the case<br>there's another interesting thing<br>financialization event seeking<br>have an application of the human capital<br>Theory but not in to the point of saying<br>that<br>um education creates<br>graduates who are productive or more<br>productive than those who are not but<br>simply in terms of screening so what<br>happens here is that Elite fight packs<br>for example will recruit from Elite<br>universities<br>um it's a contributed contest between<br>the two but they're not recruiting per<br>se because of productivity but because<br>they're the right kind of person to be<br>outward facing to Elite clients<br>so what you're judging people this is<br>screening now there is a value added to<br>what they do for their particular Farms<br>but beneath all this there's another<br>debate for another time<br>which is between productivity<br>and what is productive and what simply<br>makes a profit number two I'm going to<br>suggest comments<br>elaborate with this discussion<br>um there and so in the work I'm doing at<br>the moment I'm trying to get in<br>underneath<br>um so Progressive education system<br>education is inextricably tied to<br>economic and social policy and it can't<br>get away from it and now I get the<br>education can somehow be seen as<br>relatively autonomous as it is in some<br>theorist experience as well as in the<br>bushes and policy ain't necessarily so<br>in economic terms we need a much wider<br>conception of contribution and reward<br>and it can't be just through the narrow<br>compliance of the market Universal basic<br>income is one possibility but a<br>participation income looks like the one<br>I would go for because it would show<br>some contribution that people are making<br>however very very difficult and very<br>tricky to determine what counts as<br>participation so the Dutch a while back<br>decided they would provide an infant for<br>artists<br>in no time at all they have huge great<br>warehouses a lot<br>it's a problem<br>um we need taxes to reflect what the<br>wages<br>so in other words having a crack at<br>financialization and rent seeking and I<br>know that you have a debate about<br>capital gain Stacks here some time ago<br>um it's absolutely essential and it's<br>essential for purposes of meritocracy<br>far less anything else and the reason<br>for that is that if you've got students<br>that see that they're they can't get on<br>a housing ladder and the prices houses<br>is going quite an explanation I know<br>just clapping now going down the top but<br>if you're in Auckland house prices<br>rising exponentially or even remote<br>far quicker than you can make any money<br>in terms of an annual wage<br>and so go well where's the Justice in<br>that where is the fair those won't you<br>referred those paid and FedEx pay for<br>Friday's wage very very tricky<br>so there are good educational reasons<br>why we need to develop ways of<br>reducing event seeking and reducing<br>from for example shares so in the United<br>Kingdom you pay far less tax on the<br>shares that you gain that you get<br>earnings from then you do for wages well<br>that just seems untenable to me but<br>however<br>there it is<br>um and we need to write that job<br>property I know it's a huge problem here<br>it's a huge problem in the most nearly<br>um countries<br>um but what we know before well right it<br>doesn't seem to get through to Treasures<br>sometimes is that if you want good<br>education you've got to have kids not<br>important<br>um Progressive education<br>I worked for a while<br>um on a working Party by<br>um<br>the water Society in the United Kingdom<br>and we're trying to develop a much<br>broader curriculum but boy the political<br>the politics that went in by the wrong<br>Society to try and get politicians to<br>understand why we needed the board of<br>curriculum it was real tough going and I<br>don't know what the answer is I don't<br>know what happened there<br>we need to confront historical legacies<br>um in other words when we talk about<br>personal knowledge we've got to just say<br>look<br>there are these kinds of temperatures<br>obscure the role of women of Serial race<br>um we just got to stop them and in fact<br>class<br>um we've got to have histories which are<br>much more kind of relevant and pertinent<br>to the young generation of today<br>fighting indeed the whole society<br>and we need to democratize our schools<br>so<br>45 minutes I'm I hope you managed to<br>stay with me for I hope that I was<br>fair enough so you can see yeah it's<br>gonna maybe he's got a point there<br>there's connections that we need to<br>think about<br>um but that's it thank you very much<br>so we now have the opportunity to have<br>something more of a discussion with a<br>few and I know looking around the room<br>that we have<br>things that you've been talking about<br>you in fact I think about if we've got<br>um x two or three generations not just<br>within the education but within the Y<br>conventions in social sciences of people<br>so I'd be interested to hear you reflect<br>on that because then part is the<br>challenge of a more polarized context<br>that we seek like for example to do this<br>with that very degree support is<br>happening in the universities which is<br>that you know inevitable but there is<br>you know it's how much work in education<br>in the moment itself do I guess it's my<br>question yeah well I was the question I<br>was asking myself and so I was fixed on<br>what is the what is the degree of<br>autonomy that we have and I think the<br>conclusion is just the wrong question<br>um when you look at the<br>interrelationship between those modes of<br>accumulation and their impact on<br>education<br>for so much of what we want to do in<br>education you've actually got to address<br>other things altogether so you've got to<br>address climate change in the climate<br>crisis you've got to address issues to<br>do with honor and Commonwealth<br>um you've got to address the fundamental<br>problems in the labor market which are<br>causing and I know this is not only the<br>labor market but it is a key point in<br>terms of the cultural rules so in other<br>words<br>for education to get some degree of<br>let's call it Freedom it really requires<br>these other<br>these other policies to be addressed or<br>the issues to be addressed so I decided<br>that the only way I mean the shorthand<br>would be that there's a relation<br>you know relational relationship between<br>the economy political economy and<br>education so I mean I spent an awful lot<br>of time head scratching game well<br>I don't know it's just the one question<br>so that's alcohol I'm sure there's lots<br>of questions that the people will want<br>to ask so<br>um<br>would you be able to elaborate and then<br>what uh the broadcast<br>schools because we are in the so-called<br>Democratic country is the<br>correct system and supposed to Capital<br>Area so that means specific and then<br>okay so two points<br>um here one is that's a question about<br>um<br>the curriculum<br>and what kind of curriculum would be<br>appropriate for Democratic schooling but<br>the album would be the actual<br>arrangements of Institutions<br>universities or schools which enabled a<br>much more prominent position<br>for students now I know that's tricky<br>because there's another argument which<br>says well you can't have Democratic<br>citizens citizenship unless students<br>already have a prior knowledge of their<br>own sorts I understand there's a tension<br>um but nevertheless I think we could go<br>a whole lot further than we are because<br>what's happening is that when these<br>students walk out of school<br>what they're saying is you people don't<br>know what you're talking about we do and<br>of course they're absolutely right<br>when it comes to climate the climate<br>crisis<br>it's their lives not our lives that's<br>going to be most affected by it<br>so that's just the point I'm trying to<br>make and there are many different ways<br>in which that could be done some of<br>which are kind of off the wall and<br>um thank you and Wendy for this evening<br>we'll talk about capitalism and<br>education to make capitalism create jobs<br>education create graduate but the<br>problem in New Zealand right now is that<br>we don't have enough doctors and nurses<br>to serve our community so the problem<br>lies in capitalism they create wealth<br>through businesses what about public<br>health the hospital the staff shortage<br>and the need we have we want in our<br>country because of our own New Zealand<br>we use a migraine coming in the<br>population is growing so there's this<br>need of Health surveys<br>yeah absolutely<br>um<br>and my point wasn't that there isn't a<br>relationship between higher education<br>for example Market because clearly with<br>the professions that is the case that<br>has to be the case<br>um however<br>um it's also the case that<br>um public not only Health but education<br>most of the Public Services have been<br>run down in many countries and<br>um I mean the Prime Minister of England<br>at the moment was asked not long ago can<br>you think of anything that has improved<br>some manufacturers answer because the<br>answer is not a lot if anything<br>and so there is a fundamental problem<br>there that there's also a fundamental<br>problem<br>because if you then take doctors and<br>nurses from other countries<br>you're basically taking away the talent<br>and the skills from that country which<br>may be desperately needed them to the<br>wealthier countries to put it another<br>way so it's a fundamental problem<br>absolutely<br>doctors and nurses<br>from Museum they came to work<br>curious<br>yeah okay so doctors and nurses in<br>Australia well an awful lot of English<br>doctors and nurses that are going to<br>Australia and New Zealand actually<br>they're coming here because they get<br>much better deal it's because Australia<br>gives them more money for us well I<br>suspect it's not only that it's the<br>amount of pressure<br>and the loads of accountability which<br>are in operation<br>which are oppressive in terms of the<br>amount of time is spent I mean I have a<br>small operation on my hand<br>it took the doctor<br>in Two Shots perhaps<br>half an hour<br>the letters he wrote to my GP would have<br>taken him as long I was absolutely<br>amazed at how long this letter was and I<br>thought mate you did this just like that<br>well this out just like that and now<br>look at all the people<br>you could have just said he came in you<br>have this problem I did it<br>but no one's interior<br>are you saying this doesn't happen in<br>Australia I don't know I have no clue<br>because I have yet to and hope I never<br>have to deal with anybody any national<br>Medical Institution anymore but<br>nevertheless I don't know it was the<br>answer<br>it's another question about the oh<br>about about the jury the what is the<br>structure of the banking in Germany that<br>it's um they are not in Strife like<br>other Banks<br>the German system tends to be much more<br>Regional<br>Regional much smaller Banks and the only<br>I mean I think they've got two very<br>large Banks one of which of course is<br>Deutsche Bank which is always in trouble<br>but<br>often<br>um then qualify that but they have I<br>mean a lot of the<br>economic work that's done in Germany is<br>not done by banks in England because<br>they just play safe risk diverse and<br>only then mortgage it in a money for<br>mortgages in Germany there's much more<br>linkage to<br>um<br>the economy there I think which is<br>another part of you know like I was<br>talking to a large group of policy<br>makers in Singapore a while back<br>and they love League tables in Singapore<br>and I said okay now you tell me which<br>country has got our best one perhaps two<br>universities in the top 50<br>internationally<br>um and yet it's probably one of the most<br>successful economies in the world and<br>then think of another country which has<br>got a good dozen in the top 50 and is a<br>failing economy and they scratch their<br>heads and they just they thought I was I<br>was having a laugh<br>the cots the German universities are<br>much more tightly linked to their<br>Economic Development the economic<br>yes<br>um thank you I worry a little bit that<br>you<br>talk as if the University's function is<br>primarily just education that is turning<br>out what you call educated persons or<br>educated people<br>and I mean at the heart of the problem<br>of living in a neoliberal capitalist<br>Society is the fact that the individual<br>uh has to get through their life on on a<br>basis of being able to earn an income<br>support a family to those regular things<br>that are simply a prerequisite for<br>living a good life<br>um the university has a function that's<br>eventually quite separate from that<br>which is to be<br>the locus of critical thinking<br>about how life could be different than<br>how Society could be different and for<br>the educated person<br>their their role that you're you're sort<br>of assigning them the role of changing<br>the world without<br>providing them with the agency for<br>changing the world and the university<br>can surely<br>be more usefully thought of as the locus<br>of knowledge and critical thinking and<br>the thinking and of signposting the<br>future<br>um in a way that goes well beyond just<br>turning out educated persons and I worry<br>about the slightly Sausage Factory image<br>of the University that I thought you<br>were promoting here<br>um so that critical thinking is<br>essential to a democracy<br>but<br>um<br>you know the degree to which governments<br>take on board that critical thinking is<br>very limited<br>um so for example<br>that I did with Philip Brown and see<br>John the death of human capital<br>I've laid out a whole set of data for<br>the head of strategy for the Department<br>for education in England<br>and I took it through it and he looks at<br>me says yeah I understand that and then<br>he says but it's in the two hard basket<br>I can't do it I can't touch this<br>and that's the problem right you can do<br>critical thinking you can raise a whole<br>series of questions and what you get is<br>um<br>universities that's what should they<br>should be foreign<br>factories and the fundamental Point Jeff<br>now<br>is that for students of the younger<br>generation into their 30s that idea of<br>being able to get a decent income get a<br>house and a family and all those things<br>that you've just mentioned is intensely<br>problematic<br>so let's hear from<br>um some of the students that we've got<br>thank you<br>okay<br>um for me I went to University during<br>the right when that horrible cruel<br>failed experiment of<br>um having interest charged on student<br>loans while people were at University<br>was happening and my brothers were<br>slightly older than me went to you know<br>well one of them went to University<br>anyway just before that and it's really<br>like that was such a bad idea you know<br>um there's a big big huge Gulf of how<br>our life trajectories went basically you<br>know he was able to go straight from<br>University over to England earn big<br>bucks come back buy a house have the two<br>kids dogs you know all that nice stuff<br>and you know I graduated with massive<br>massive debt when I was doing my<br>internship in the health system so I<br>could probably go on to some of those<br>questions raised about doctors and<br>and people in the health system you know<br>while I was doing my internship I didn't<br>have enough money to buy a newspaper in<br>the weekend and things have only gotten<br>worse for students even though they took<br>away the interest like I don't think<br>that<br>materially things have gotten better for<br>students and when I was flooding with a<br>friend who was a doctor and she was a<br>registrar at the time and this is why<br>our doctors our best and brightest they<br>they leave us they leave New Zealand<br>they go to Australia they go to England<br>because they can earn more but also<br>they're treated like absolute crap here<br>like when my now now my friend that I<br>was flirting with is a consultant she's<br>doing very well owns a house blah blah<br>blah but when she was a junior doctor<br>she was working dangerous hours with<br>massive amounts of pressure on her and I<br>would see her after a long shift saving<br>lives looking like an absolute zombie<br>and things haven't gotten better for for<br>students things haven't gotten better<br>for workers they've gotten a lot lot<br>worse<br>and in the meantime like we we don't<br>treat our young Workforce well at all<br>but our institutions will spend a lot of<br>money going to England to advertise the<br>idea<br>for young doctors there to come to New<br>Zealand as this really really lovely<br>place where they can have a holiday and<br>they can go tramping and hiking and<br>surfing and all that sort of stuff and<br>we're kind of like a destination<br>Workforce for them<br>but our own workers<br>aren't treated well and the amount of<br>doctors and Pharmacists and nurses we<br>produce has been kept artificially low<br>like when I was in pharmacy school it<br>was kept at 100 people per year I think<br>that's been increased to 150 something<br>like that med school you had to get at<br>least like an A plus average just to get<br>in<br>and now we say oh we don't have enough<br>we have to import people from overseas<br>because we don't have enough it's not<br>because we don't have the talent it's<br>not that we don't have the people<br>wanting to do it but anybody that wants<br>to go into med school nowadays looks and<br>they see how people are treated for like<br>the first 10 years of their working<br>career and they think<br>would I survive there or would I have a<br>mental breakdown and I think you know<br>meritocracy died a long time ago it's<br>corpses being paraded around still like<br>Weekend at Bernie's but you know like<br>I've got a 15 year old kid he's decided<br>already that the way that he's going to<br>get an education is to do it through the<br>Army and I mean I ideologically I have a<br>problem with that but I can't say that<br>he's wrong<br>rant over thanks for coming for my TED<br>Talk<br>like<br>thank you and one of the observations<br>that I've made about Germany previously<br>is that a feature of the German<br>education system is the relationship it<br>has to The Wider German Society in in<br>the view that the economic life of<br>Germany is is connected intimately to<br>the social life of Germany and the<br>educational life of Germany and there's<br>a a very strong commitment that<br>local employers industry<br>have a relationship with the community<br>and with with education and and that is<br>enacted in material forms so the local<br>employers are expected to take children<br>from the local schools and provide them<br>with a context through the sort of<br>secondary school period they use<br>different terms for it<br>to expose people to what it is to live<br>in the adult world and and to start to<br>develop skills and knowledge and to be<br>part of<br>Society in a nicely transitional way and<br>that that's a much larger proportion of<br>people in German Society go through that<br>type of experience than go through a<br>formal degree experience<br>and that seems to functionally work<br>really well for them because the a lot<br>of the costs of that are borne by the<br>companies that otherwise would be<br>capturing that as profits and and<br>controlling that wealth it's being<br>turned into society there's a<br>relationship between what you learn and<br>what you experience in life so that's<br>motivating and engaging and authentic<br>for for the Learners and it's enabled<br>them to to be able to see that when they<br>do have things like universities that<br>they do retain that intellectual<br>leadership role and though they<br>recognize that that's important but not<br>going to Define normality and not going<br>to Define good German citizenry so I<br>guess the question I have for you is is<br>how do we help<br>our employers our wider Society<br>recognize that they are in fact the<br>problem here that their attitude to<br>their place in our communities and our<br>societies and the way that they invest<br>into society through education and<br>opportunities for newer generations and<br>and paying for that accepting that it's<br>a cost of them being part of our society<br>how do we make that happen<br>is it oh two coins I don't know the<br>answer so I've got two comments so I've<br>got diving members<br>um<br>the first is that what you say about<br>Germany is exactly true and it's also<br>the case that they have a very different<br>understanding of what the nature of paid<br>work is that the nature of the labor<br>market and paid work so in the past you<br>automatically you used to be able to do<br>a three and a half year apprenticeship<br>to be a retail person for example<br>my son in England<br>um spent two hours<br>at an Electronics shop being trained and<br>um so you find it's exactly right<br>I'll make two other points though one is<br>that of course Germany uh because it's<br>got a very large unproductive service<br>sector a lot of jobs are called many<br>jobs so they've got a high degree of<br>people who are<br>unpopular<br>so it's not as it used to be in that<br>sense<br>but nevertheless the point is right the<br>only thing I'd say is that my wife<br>worked for a while at<br>um<br>what used to be going known as the<br>Polytechnic in Christchurch I forgot<br>what it's called<br>yep and she said that the employers<br>around cattle were actually very good at<br>doing exactly what you've suggested<br>however it is the case<br>um perhaps in other parts of the museum<br>it's certainly the case in the UK that<br>employers have no interest very little<br>interest and let's say the top<br>engineering companies and having<br>apprenticeships<br>um and in fact I've got a colleague<br>um there you're a keep who's kind of key<br>person on apprenticeships and Technical<br>education who says the reason why so<br>many people go to university in a funded<br>together well they aren't refunding<br>business there but who are unable to go<br>to university is simply because<br>employers have no interest in those who<br>are not already there you have gone<br>through University even if they're not<br>going to do a graduate work after that<br>um in other words it's offended by<br>employees which has led to us and making<br>observation that we can<br>established the government talked about<br>the progression of these uh Workforce<br>Development councils and talk about how<br>important it was to have this<br>relationship but if you go through and<br>read what it is that they're being<br>established included in terms of<br>reference and about it it's all about<br>how is the public and these individual<br>students going to do the things that<br>meet the needs of employers there is<br>nothing in any of our populations<br>we're going to do to make up their<br>contribution<br>it's it's an issue in<br>narrative countries<br>and that's largely because so much of<br>the powers gone from Trade union so it<br>used to be the linkage to some of this<br>so I think we've got time for one more<br>hi um thank you very much you for that<br>stimulating talk<br>um<br>the book I'm taking away from this is<br>your statement that there's a gap<br>between what Society needs and what the<br>labor market produces<br>um it seems to me there's two parts to<br>this issue one<br>um what Society needs<br>and the other is the labor market it<br>sounds as if the what Society needs does<br>not reflect<br>or rather the income distribution<br>doesn't reflect what the society needs<br>so the bits that actually are in need<br>don't have the money to pay for the<br>labor the other bit is the question of<br>whether the labor market itself works<br>properly when there is an income demand<br>and it seems to me from the discussion<br>of doctors for example that Simply<br>Having the demand is not enough to<br>produce a supply now in a small country<br>like New Zealand this is partly because<br>of the competition that exists from<br>overseas the international labor market<br>for doctors may work extremely well<br>but unfortunately on both the supply<br>side in the demand side it doesn't<br>necessarily work well for individual<br>countries<br>um so the internationalization of the<br>labor market which is not just confined<br>to doctors of course does create<br>problems for individual countries<br>but the first point about<br>society's needs are not being met<br>clearly the areas of need are not those<br>that have the money to pay for it we<br>need good pediatric care we need good<br>palliative care we need people to care<br>for people to know what's ages those are<br>not sectors of the economy that have the<br>money to pay for that<br>so there's a distribution of income<br>problem and then there's a labor market<br>problem<br>and I think it too can benefit from<br>separate discussion as well as bringing<br>together as you've done thank you<br>oh yeah absolutely I mean we could spend<br>much longer on exactly these points but<br>what I was suggesting was that we need<br>some way of expanding<br>um our understanding of<br>um contribution in society which is<br>related to funds<br>and that seems to me to me that one<br>addresses the doctor issue but it will<br>address many of the other issues I would<br>hope<br>but we have yet to have that kind of<br>contribution there are great things when<br>you can begin to see<br>the possibility of that working so for<br>example and this is a very strange<br>example but it is the case that Britain<br>after brexit they decided they were<br>going to change the agricultural policy<br>so that<br>um reward was given for attending the<br>land rather than simply making it profit<br>now they've got an awful lot of trouble<br>but nevertheless there's something there<br>just saying there is a wider benefit<br>here that we need to reward<br>and they've got stuck but nevertheless<br>the original intention I think is kind<br>of interesting<br>um my last point is this that I walked<br>here with Brian Easton at the back there<br>and we got to taputi cokery and he<br>pointed out that there's a Ralph Pottery<br>sculpture there and the Ralph actually<br>sculptures of a a Greek pillow which is<br>on the ground and I shall use that for<br>subsequent talks when I give this talk<br>over again because I thought it was just<br>excellent<br>thank you very much and it's good to<br>know that there's going to be an image<br>from uh whanganuiotara that can train<br>with you back to uh your home vet in bar<br>and we know that you have um strong<br>commitments and in groups in the small<br>world and it's always lovely to see when<br>you come back thank you again for giving<br>us a very wide-ranging and provocative<br>tour and some things to think about uh<br>as we begin to do more as we continue<br>their concession about<br>what kind of university for what kind of<br>future our visit that we will uh create<br>new companies in the society so they<br>could be your wish to impact so it's<br>more fair more just uh more caring a<br>communist and Society so please join<br>with me thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
