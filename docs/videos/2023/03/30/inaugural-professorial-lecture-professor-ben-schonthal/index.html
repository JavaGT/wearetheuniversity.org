great<br>honor to be hosting this IPL this<br>evening<br>um a very warm welcome to all of you who<br>are gathered here in person those of you<br>who are online both currently hopefully<br>and uh in the future uh it's fantastic<br>that you've all gathered to share this<br>occasion with Ben this evening I just<br>realized in my mehi I should have<br>acknowledged you how in our acting Vice<br>chances<br>um these are very special events the<br>fact that we are wearing these robes are<br>an indicator of that specialness we wear<br>these robes very rarely these days at<br>least here at the University of otago<br>they are safe for very special occasions<br>for graduations when we celebrate the<br>end of the academic journeys of our<br>students<br>and for these events inaugural<br>professorial lectures When We Gather to<br>Mark the promotion of a colleague to the<br>highest academic rank within the<br>university celebrating their scholarship<br>their research and contribution to our<br>institution to our communities to our<br>country<br>these events are really special because<br>they embody and celebrate the Endeavors<br>that are at the heart of the university<br>the scholarly Journey the creation of<br>new knowledge and the transmission of<br>knowledge to students to colleagues and<br>to the interested public<br>so it is great that we've all gathered<br>here this evening to celebrate both the<br>outstanding scholar that Ben is and more<br>broadly the critically important place<br>of knowledge in our community I'll hand<br>over in a moment Professor will Sweetman<br>who offer a follow a more formal or<br>perhaps more formal introduction to<br>being but personally I just wanted to<br>note that being as a true all-rounder<br>assembling outstanding researcher a<br>great teacher an important leader on our<br>campus since arriving at otago Ben has<br>proven himself to be an exemplary<br>institutional citizen I work closely<br>with Ben when I was PVC and I was always<br>struck by his positivity by his desire<br>to make things better and to create<br>opportunities for current and future<br>students and for his colleagues those<br>are qualities that I think are greatly<br>valued by all the people gathered here<br>this evening Ben who are very lucky to<br>work with you so uh Kathy enough from me<br>I will now hand over to Professor<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>my name is Will Sweetman and I'm the<br>head of the school of social sciences uh<br>which is the academic unit within which<br>uh Ben's religion program sits so it is<br>my pleasure and privilege to introduce<br>Ben Chantal to you today<br>I think I first met Ben at a rooftop<br>restaurant overlooking the Bay of Bengal<br>he remembers<br>in about 2008.<br>at the time he was a PhD student at the<br>University of Chicago and like me he was<br>an India learning languages although<br>he's done a much better job of it um<br>Ben struck me then as an extremely<br>bright and very likable young scholar<br>although he told me then that he'd<br>studied at otago I never imagined that<br>he and I would later become colleagues<br>Ben Rosita's PhD from a tiger from<br>Chicago rather in in 2012 and took up<br>his appointment at otago as a lecturer<br>the following year although he already<br>had experience of teaching at Chicago at<br>Auckland and at Victoria<br>yeah<br>he's been an outstanding colleague much<br>of the success<br>it would be one of my talks to this I<br>having Ben would feel insulted if I if I<br>didn't<br>much of the success that we've achieved<br>in the religion program over the last<br>decade is is directly attributable to<br>Ben's men's Talent<br>and his prodigious appetite partly for<br>in the decade that he's been here Ben<br>has received multiple awards for<br>teaching for research and for<br>supervision<br>so in teaching he began with an award<br>from ousa in 2015. uh followed up with a<br>divisional of the humanities award in<br>2018 and then a university award in<br>2019.<br>for research he received the early<br>career award for distinction and<br>research in 2016 and again followed this<br>up with Thoreau Heath trust award and<br>Carl Smith medal in 2021.<br>he also received a perfect score in the<br>2019 pbrf round uh a 700 out of 700. and<br>for those of you who don't understand<br>pbrf lucky you but this basically makes<br>him the Nadia kametsky of research<br>only he is slightly taller than her<br>and in 2016 he was also a finalist in<br>the OU USA supervisor of the Year Awards<br>and those are just the awards that otago<br>has given him there are many others on<br>his CV<br>as soon as the university introduces an<br>award for the best head of Department I<br>feel pretty sure Ben will Target and<br>then win that one too<br>in research Ben has systematically<br>identified and published in all of the<br>very first-rate journals in the multiple<br>Fields across which he works Roger<br>Ben and I have taught and supervised<br>together<br>um<br>and he has made me a better teacher and<br>as a supervisor he has a remarkable<br>ability<br>to identify what is truly important and<br>interesting in a research project and<br>three of the five phds that he<br>supervised to date completion have been<br>added to the divisional's list of<br>exceptional theses<br>Ben and I have been close colleagues as<br>I said for over a decade now but it is a<br>measure of how much he does that when I<br>had the privilege of writing the head of<br>Department assessment statement on his<br>promotion application<br>there were many many things on his CV<br>that I had no idea that he was doing a<br>recent example of this is his initiative<br>with our divisional caithena Maori Tania<br>Brown to run essay writing workshops for<br>Maori<br>all of this is done without Fanfare uh<br>just because it's part of what Ben does<br>his energy and commitment to his<br>vocation as a teacher a scholarly and a<br>colleague are truly exceptional he is<br>having mentioned Ben's Talent as a<br>teacher I think it's important for me to<br>conclude this introduction by issuing a<br>kind of health warning<br>if during the course of this lecture<br>this evening you feel a sudden and<br>overwhelming urge to change the<br>direction of your life and to take up<br>the academic study of Religion or to<br>enroll for a major in religion please do<br>not be alarmed<br>this is a very common side effect of<br>listening to Ben's lectures<br>fortunately there is an antidote<br>available you just need to attend one of<br>mine<br>so safe in that knowledge I would now<br>like to invite Ben to deliver his<br>lecture laws Karma cause an effect in<br>courtroom and Cosmos<br>I only did that hug to show you how<br>short I was<br>so he wasn't lying about that<br>um God I'm totally overwhelmed thank you<br>so much for that I'm so overwhelmed in<br>fact that I I had a speech written out<br>here but um<br>I think in light of that I'm just going<br>to go freelance<br>just kidding I would never do that I'm<br>so freaked out about this lecture<br>I'm I'm really nervous<br>um<br>welcome to those of you thank you so<br>much for coming here people both in the<br>flesh and online<br>I want to give a special acknowledgment<br>to my sister<br>and my nephew Sam and my sister's part<br>sister's partner Meg for coming all the<br>way<br>from New York for this God Will's gonna<br>make me cry<br>um I want to thank my colleagues in<br>religion uh John Elizabeth Joseph Dean<br>Greg our newest colleague Muhammad<br>um<br>I mean I don't know how other people<br>feel about who they work with but I feel<br>particularly lucky<br>I want to give a special thank you to my<br>students past and present who were here<br>today everything that I do at this<br>University for the most part I I try to<br>have you in mind and it's really special<br>to have you here<br>but most of all I want to thank my<br>family my wife Paula and my two<br>wonderful Sons Henry and Oliver<br>if there's anything at all to celebrate<br>professionally for me it's it's because<br>of them and their support it's them<br>throughout the history of Buddhism<br>there's been a long-standing debate<br>about Karma<br>most of you will have heard of karma<br>it's that famous law of cause and effect<br>which be which has become part of our<br>popular culture<br>that Cosmic principle that links present<br>actions with future outcomes or to quote<br>Justin Timberlake<br>the idea that what goes around goes<br>around goes around comes all the way<br>back around<br>but none of you saw Justin Timberlake<br>quote coming that soon in my IPL<br>this Buddhist debate over karma is not<br>about whether the principle is true<br>for most Buddhists karma is<br>unquestionable it just happens<br>do something good good things will come<br>do something to bad well I warned you<br>Karma operates like gravity it's<br>predictable mechanical<br>inevitable<br>dropping moral apples on your head<br>whether or not you believe in it<br>but while Buddhists agree that Karma<br>Works they don't always agree about how<br>it works<br>precisely how do one's actions in the<br>present influence one's condition in the<br>future<br>does Karma work in a one for one way is<br>there a single consequence for every<br>each and every action one does<br>and if so when can one expect that<br>consequence within an hour within our<br>lifetime<br>after all according to the Buddha we've<br>all been reborn countless numbers of<br>times already<br>so many in fact that it's likely that<br>the person sitting next to you right now<br>in this lecture was either your parent<br>the idea that Karma Works in a one for<br>one way is confirmed by some Buddhist<br>texts<br>these texts will say that actions Karma<br>are like seeds planted in a fertile<br>ground<br>those seeds give rise to fruits which we<br>harvest in the future<br>these texts tell us that we are we are<br>all vast moral plantations fields of<br>karmic plants each one the fruition of<br>this is not the only way to think about<br>Karma however<br>other texts suggest that Karma might<br>actually work in aggregate rather than<br>one action producing one result it's the<br>totality of our actions that matter<br>in this view Karma Works more like<br>batting averages or credit scores<br>what matters most is your moral<br>performance over the long term your<br>cumulative balance of good actions and<br>bad<br>it turns out that Kings in South Asia<br>were particularly fond of this second<br>model<br>we know this because they kept written<br>ledgers tallying up all their good<br>actions<br>these ledgers called Merit books gave<br>King's comfort that if they gave enough<br>money to charity or built enough<br>Buddhist temples they could<br>counterbalance the harms they caused by<br>Waging War and punishing criminals<br>in other words they could ensure a good<br>rebirth by investing heavily in karmic<br>offsets<br>these debates about Karma have not been<br>resolved<br>those of us who study Buddhism learn a<br>lot about what karma is but gain very<br>little certainty about how Karma works<br>the same could be said about the study<br>of law<br>writing this lecture has been an<br>unsettling experience for me not just<br>because I knew will was going to<br>introduce me<br>but because of the peculiar nature of<br>IPL talks<br>academics like me usually leave personal<br>details out of public lectures yet in an<br>IPL it's customary to provide the<br>audience with a biography a personal and<br>secular personal and scholarly story<br>that explains how one got here<br>it's an activity that to my mind has the<br>flavor of a karmic Ledger an accounting<br>of for one's present conditions by<br>listing one's previous actions<br>this kind of thing feels particularly<br>weird for me<br>weird because it all feels so strange<br>so strange that a Jewish kid from<br>Chicago who spent most of his<br>undergraduate life training to be a<br>medical doctor is now a professor of<br>Buddhist studies in New Zealand<br>my wife Paula also finds it strange<br>you see we actually met here at otago<br>just about 25 years ago<br>when I came to Dunedin for one semester<br>as a study abroad student<br>the year was 1998.<br>flannel shirts were cool<br>the first time<br>and I remember in July of that year<br>Paula and I sitting around her squalid<br>flat on George Street<br>close huddling close around a space<br>heater<br>eating two minute noodles<br>listening to Portis head<br>on minidisc<br>and agreeing that Dunedin probably<br>wasn't for us<br>my younger son Henry now Goes to School<br>across the street from that flat my<br>favorite lecturer from that study abroad<br>Greg Dawes is now my colleague<br>and I even have a mini disc player in my<br>car<br>is all of this coincidence or Karma<br>my interest in Buddhism is easy enough<br>to place it stems for my first year as<br>an undergraduate at Bowdoin College<br>in those pre-internet days students<br>registered for classes by copying<br>enrollment codes on a piece of paper<br>when it came to my elective I mixed two<br>numbers up and ended up not in a class<br>on Shakespeare but a seminar on South<br>Asian religions<br>however I was quickly enthralled<br>in that class I learned that Buddhism<br>was an incredible tradition filled with<br>compelling philosophical ideas amazing<br>and an amazing textual history that<br>stretches back three millennia<br>I still feel that way and almost every<br>week I pinch myself at How Lucky I Am to<br>be able to teach and research about it<br>and get paid for it<br>it was a professor in that seminar John<br>Holt who suggested that I study in Sri<br>Lanka a country with strong links to<br>Buddhism as well as a long-standing<br>civil war<br>and it was in Sri Lanka that I first<br>began to ask the questions that would<br>lead me away from social away from<br>medicine and towards social science<br>how does religion influence politics<br>and what role does religion play in<br>human conflict<br>when it came to Buddhism these questions<br>seemed particularly Stark How could a<br>religion based on the moral laws of<br>karma be implicated in a violent Civil<br>War<br>the first part of my academic career I<br>tried to answer these questions<br>I examined militaristic forms of<br>Buddhism in Sri Lanka and Myanmar<br>I wrote about the use of Hindu and<br>Christian symbolism by the Tamil tigers<br>in order to commemorate their fallen<br>soldiers<br>I explored Buddhist justifications for<br>War as well as Buddhist teachings about<br>Toleration coexistence and peace<br>I learned two ancient languages Paulie<br>and Sanskrit and two modern vernaculars<br>singhala and Tamil and I've been<br>struggling ever since to hold on to them<br>I conducted interviews and ethnographies<br>and I worked to translate ancient palm<br>leaf manuscripts and modern political<br>tracks so a lot of my time recently has<br>been spent translating texts like this<br>these are texts written out on dried<br>Palmyra Palms which have a kind of a<br>long shape and when they go hard when<br>they get dry they turn into a kind of<br>wood and you can then take a middle<br>stylus and etch into these things the<br>sheaths are then bundled together with a<br>piece of string and they they look like<br>sort of yay long and yeah wide and about<br>recently with the encouragement of my<br>colleague John shaver I've also started<br>engaging in quantitative analyzes using<br>public data sets and creating my own<br>none of this I could have done alone and<br>I'm only here today because of the<br>tremendous help of friends families<br>family colleagues and teachers in Sri<br>Lanka New Zealand the Us and other<br>places and there's just a few names here<br>in this word cloud I'm sure there's many<br>of I've I've left out I was nervous and<br>probably forgot some<br>if I've learned anything in this work<br>it's that the crossroads of religion<br>politics and conflict is a chaotic space<br>filled with complex human behavior<br>yes religious ideas sometimes justify<br>violence all of them do but it's nearly<br>impossible to predict how those ideas<br>will function in a given situation<br>does religion motivate violence or is it<br>simply used to rationalize violence<br>after the fact<br>most of the time Scholars are stuck<br>looking back in time after violence has<br>occurred trying to identify the causes<br>for an event that's already happened<br>much like me trying to explain how I<br>ended up becoming a professor of<br>Buddhist studies<br>alongside these scholarly questions I've<br>also had the chance to contribute to<br>activism and policy making<br>working with judges lawmakers and<br>lawyers activists and ngos who are also<br>concerned with minimizing conflicts over<br>religion<br>and it's through this that I found<br>myself leading a double life<br>half working on religion half working on<br>law<br>is never far from discussions of human<br>conflict<br>in our modern world law has become the<br>go-to instrument for solving social<br>problems<br>too many people speeding<br>passed some laws<br>want to deal with a housing crisis<br>there's laws for that too<br>our faith in law is not unlike Buddhists<br>Buddhists faith in karma we trust that<br>it works even if we don't quite know how<br>in fact we often talk about the law of<br>karma as a way to underscore the<br>similarity between the rules of the<br>cosmos and the rules of the nation-state<br>to emphasize their shared regularity<br>what if we took this comparison further<br>rather than understanding Karma through<br>law what if we tried to understand law<br>through Karma<br>instead of talking about the law of<br>karma could we instead talk about the<br>karma of law<br>after all law like Karma forecasts a<br>relationship between action and<br>consequence it links inputs and outcomes<br>good laws are imagined to lead to good<br>behaviors bad laws to things like Civil<br>War and conflict<br>at its best at its most utopian<br>we imagine law to do its corrective work<br>in the same manner as karma mechanically<br>inevitably gravitationally<br>it makes sense then that we'd be<br>inclined to deal with the chaos of<br>religious conflict by finding the right<br>laws<br>this idea that law is the key to dealing<br>with conflicts over religion has<br>Obsessed me<br>returning to my karmic biography this<br>Obsession might come from my childhood<br>growing up as one of three triplets<br>alongside my sister Molly who's here and<br>my brother Dave<br>uh<br>my parents relied on a family rule book<br>in order to bring order and<br>predictability into our sometimes<br>chaotic household<br>that rule book which is something like<br>the love child of the U.S Constitution<br>and the Code of Hammurabi was creatively<br>titled The schoenthal Book of Rules<br>so this is the this is the uh an image<br>from the first page of the 1992 Edition<br>there were subsequent amended versions<br>in 1993 and 1994. this of course is the<br>first section's freedom of movement<br>curfew and rules about Motor Vehicles I<br>think we concluded last night when we<br>read them to my kids before they went to<br>bed that our favorite rule was this one<br>about public rooms all public living<br>areas need to be kept clean by everyone<br>if any of the rooms are left messy<br>bathroom kitchen Den that's the lounge<br>basement<br>Etc a universal fine of 25 cents will be<br>applied to all children is the universal<br>fund common in law Jess is it I'm not<br>um Paula and I are not above this and<br>we've recently adopted our own technique<br>at home although somewhat less<br>comprehensive than the schoenthal Book<br>of Rules we recently finalized the<br>PlayStation contract of 2021<br>this is written in Ollie's hand we had<br>him copied out it's shorter but equally<br>autocratic document I I will direct you<br>to the first Clause Mom and Dad have<br>full authority over the PlayStation and<br>can change the rules at any given time<br>that's not a very rule of law document<br>but legal nonetheless<br>but perhaps my karma starts even earlier<br>in a previous lifetime<br>this kind of thing happens frequently in<br>Buddhist narratives the usual setup is<br>something like this the protagonist in a<br>story finds themselves in some kind of<br>predicament like having to give an IPL<br>lecture<br>and asks for the Buddha's help<br>the Buddha rather than offering a<br>solution to the problem will tell the<br>person about some other being often an<br>animal such as a monkey<br>who faced a similar predicament in some<br>earlier Cosmic era<br>the Buddha will then go on to explain<br>how the monkey solved the problem so<br>long ago before telling the protagonist<br>that the monkey was actually them in a<br>previous life and that they should solve<br>their problem in a similar way<br>as for me I squirm at the idea that I<br>might have been a monkey Professor<br>thousands of lifetimes ago but I can't<br>say that's the thing with Karma the root<br>from action to outcome is opaque<br>nevertheless the more I engage in legal<br>research the more I come to feel the<br>imprint of past lives<br>I learned recently for example that my<br>great-grandmother was among the first<br>class of woman lawyers to graduate from<br>the University of Chicago Law School and<br>among the earliest group of women to be<br>admitted to the bar in Illinois<br>I learned that she served as legal<br>counsel for Jane Adams who's considered<br>to be a founder of modern day social<br>work a profession my wife now practices<br>I'm not sharing these details as part of<br>the world's worst humble brag I mean if<br>anything they should chart a decline in<br>the schoenthal family but they these<br>details do make a karmic point<br>the very mechanisms that one might use<br>to test Karma that is selectively<br>looking for past actions that could<br>produce present outcomes<br>also affirms the truth of karma itself<br>that is to say in asking how Karma works<br>we often Aver that it does work<br>modern theories of law depend on a<br>similarly circular argument<br>we assume that particular laws produce<br>particular outcomes in assessing those<br>claims we look for the fit between<br>social circumstances and legal design<br>has will Sweetman been driving slower<br>lately well done speeding laws<br>housing prices out of control bad job<br>property law<br>when things go wrong it's the input the<br>input that's at fault not the model<br>itself<br>that is to say we affirm laws Karma even<br>if we don't know how it works<br>this kind of thinking has been<br>particularly common when it comes to<br>designing constitutional law<br>a genre of law that in many places is<br>thought of as the highest form of law<br>making or as Bilbo Baggins might say the<br>one law to rule them all sorry I got<br>carried away with the film memes and try<br>to get another punch line here<br>but I do think that Bilbo is right<br>we live in a world of constitutions<br>out of nearly 200 constitutions in the<br>world only four out of nearly 200<br>countries in the world only four do not<br>have a written Constitution we just<br>happen to live in one of them<br>but even here we look to a set of<br>constitution-like basic laws those laws<br>are presumed to structure our politics<br>and act as expressions of our shared<br>values<br>this faith in law and confidence in<br>constitutions is a defining feature of<br>our current age<br>as we speak there are legal Scholars<br>working all over the world advising<br>countries on how to manage their social<br>problems through constitutional<br>provisions<br>in any given year nearly 20 percent of<br>the world's 198 constitutions will be<br>undergoing processes of revision or<br>replacement and more than half of all<br>constitutions enforce right now were<br>drafted in the last 30 years many of<br>them in the aftermath of conflicts like<br>the one in Sri Lanka<br>one could even say that places like Sri<br>Lanka or Sudan or Libya have become<br>something like Laboratories for<br>constitutional law Proving Grounds for<br>laws Karma<br>the problem is that while we may assume<br>that constitutional law will resolve<br>such social conflicts we don't actually<br>know that this is the case<br>consider the types of conflicts that I<br>research which involve tensions among<br>religious groups<br>to test the effects of constitutional<br>law on this type of conflict you would<br>want to know at the very least whether<br>religious tensions increase or decrease<br>after new Constitutions are introduced<br>fortunately for us there are two data<br>sets which when combined allow us to<br>answer this question for one period in<br>history<br>the first data set comes from the Pew<br>form in the U.S which between 2007 and<br>2016 tracked religion-based social<br>hostilities in every country in the<br>world giving each a score out of 10<br>based on 13 separate indicators<br>the second is a data set curated by two<br>colleagues of mine comparative<br>constitutional law Scholars Zach Elkins<br>and Tom Ginsberg<br>this data set contains information about<br>every single Constitution created over<br>the last 200 years<br>so what happened to religious<br>hostilities during this period when new<br>oops<br>in this chart you can see a list of 13<br>constitutions that were enacted between<br>2007 and 2011 as well as the change in<br>religious hostilities that were measured<br>at two years in red in three years in<br>blue<br>five years sorry in blue<br>all of these Constitutions are generally<br>considered to be improvements on what<br>came before or first ever Charters<br>designed for a newly formed polity<br>almost all were designed with<br>International expertise and the best of<br>intentions<br>yet even a casual look at this chart<br>shows a whirring correlation between<br>Constitution making and religious<br>hostility<br>in most cases hostilities did not<br>decrease but increase especially at five<br>years<br>what kind of karma is this<br>now let me stress this chart shows<br>correlation not causation<br>there are far too many factors in these<br>cases to draw a straight line between<br>constitutional law and religious<br>hostility<br>and this is precisely the point<br>assuming a direct causality between<br>legal inputs and social outcomes is at<br>the very least an Act of Faith<br>particularly when it comes to something<br>as complex as conflicts over religion<br>I have a confession to make<br>I'm an apostate in the Church of law<br>I believe that law can help us solve<br>some of the world's most urgent problems<br>but I do not believe that we should<br>operate on faith alone<br>I demand proof of Law's Karma research<br>that shows how law Works to reshape<br>social life in particular places and<br>times<br>fortunately I'm in good company over the<br>last few decades an entire field of<br>academics has been has also been asking<br>these questions<br>this field referred to as law and<br>Society or socio-legal studies invite<br>Scholars from many academic disciplines<br>to think about how law works on the<br>ground<br>to use techniques from the human<br>Sciences to stress test our assumptions<br>about how law works<br>one of the things I'm most excited about<br>in my time at otago has been the<br>creation with colleagues from law and<br>from history of our own otago Center for<br>Law and Society<br>the first one in New Zealand<br>to think about law and human conflict in<br>a law and Society way is to think<br>holistically about the work of law in<br>our lives<br>socio-legal Scholars are fond of<br>reminding lawyers that what happens in<br>constitutional committees and in<br>courtrooms represents only a fraction of<br>Law's influence in the world and a<br>fraction of the world's influence on law<br>I recently shared the following slide<br>with a class of law students here at<br>otago<br>the diagram is taken from some important<br>socio-legal literature on the topic of<br>disputes<br>the image is called a dispute pyramid or<br>given that we're in Dunedin maybe a<br>dispute iceberg<br>its purpose is to highlight two facts<br>about laws intermeshing with Society<br>firstly formal legal procedures such as<br>litigation tend to be unusual events in<br>most people's lives rarely the first<br>Port of Call for dealing with conflict<br>most of the time we deal with conflict<br>in other ways drawing on other systems<br>of legal ordering of social ordering<br>such as tikanga religion local Customs<br>or communal norms<br>or we lean on informal modes of Justice<br>like exclusion or shame<br>not sure about this try cutting the<br>Queue at the supermarket or requesting<br>both the cookie time cookie and the<br>cassava chips on an Air New Zealand<br>flight kiwis you know what I'm talking<br>about<br>so deeply integrated into our lives are<br>these other normative systems that they<br>often feel like politeness or common<br>sense some kind of deep natural impulse<br>about right and wrong<br>our world is dense with these systems<br>and most of the time we manage<br>disagreement using them and not the<br>courts<br>but even when we do use the courts these<br>other structures affect the way that we<br>interpret and use state law<br>if you want to understand how law Works<br>therefore you have to think about the<br>entire Iceberg both above and below the<br>water<br>the goal of my research this is the goal<br>of my research<br>on the one hand I want to know how state<br>laws such as constitutional law work on<br>the ground both inside and outside of<br>courtrooms on the other hand I also want<br>to know about how these other normative<br>systems and particularly religious law<br>work alongside and sometimes in tension<br>with state laws<br>here too I want to give things a<br>Buddhist twist<br>you see like us law can be said to have<br>multiple lives above the water we might<br>say is Law's legal life it's used by<br>judges lawyers and legal drafts persons<br>below the water is Law's life in society<br>where legal legal terms are used by<br>everyday people as a language or<br>framework for negotiating their world<br>I see this weekly when Oliver and Henry<br>invoke their quote rights to TV time on<br>Wednesday nights<br>it's also an observation that French<br>sociologist Alexi de tocqueville once<br>made about Americans he wrote<br>over about 200 years ago in America the<br>language of law has become a vulgar<br>tongue the spirit of law which is<br>produced in the schools and courts of<br>Justice gradually penetrate their walls<br>into the bosom of society where it<br>descends to all so that it lasts the the<br>whole people contract the habits and<br>tastes of the judicial Magistrate<br>I give you once again the PlayStation<br>contract of 2021.<br>but that's not all<br>when it comes to important laws like<br>constitutions we can also distinguish<br>between laws pre-enactment life as the<br>carefully worded product of political<br>negotiation and its post-enactment life<br>as a collection of rules and principles<br>intended to guide a country's shared<br>future<br>unlike the Buddhist birth stories I<br>described above however legal principles<br>function differently in these different<br>lives<br>consider for example one of the most<br>common legal principles used to mediate<br>conflicts over religion in the modern<br>world<br>and in modern constitutions the right to<br>Religious Freedom<br>this feature this principle the right to<br>religious free Freedom features<br>prominently in about three quarters of<br>the world's basic laws<br>for those drafting constitutions<br>religious freedom is a very useful<br>principle<br>not just because it's a good thing but<br>because it's a vague thing raise your<br>hand if you don't like religious freedom<br>exactly<br>as you can see it's a principle that<br>virtually everyone can agree on<br>religious majorities and minorities<br>secularists and the faithful those who<br>like the idea of religion in public and<br>those who oppose it<br>it's this very vagueness that makes<br>religious freedom useful for lawmakers<br>because it helps them find nominal<br>consensus among populations with<br>different even conflicting attitudes but<br>the proper place of religion in society<br>so much for the pre-enactment life of<br>religious freedom what happens<br>post-enactment<br>the enactment of law is a magical<br>process through solemn words and<br>ceremonial gestures the same vague<br>phrases that had once been used to<br>sidestep disagreement by politicians<br>suddenly suddenly reappear as weighty<br>principles for resolving disputes<br>through this ritual process purposeful<br>abstractions come to be treated as<br>transparent principles for ordering and<br>harmonizing Society<br>Charmed phrases whose authority is<br>undeniable but whose meaning remains<br>contestable become our guidelines for<br>dealing with strife<br>the problem is not so much that law does<br>this in its legal life after all courts<br>and lawyers are used to dealing with<br>abstract Concepts and playing with<br>definitions<br>the problem is rather that law also<br>tends to do this in its societal Life<br>below the water<br>that is it encourages us to encourages<br>us to think of one kind of dispute<br>real-life disagreements over specific<br>issues as another kind of dispute<br>disputes over fixed freedoms and<br>absolute rights Universal principles and<br>non-negotiable ideals<br>it pushes us away from the usual local<br>habitual practices of problem solving<br>and towards the polarized setting of<br>Courts<br>were complex multi-sided disagreements<br>are shoehorned into neat adversarial<br>binaries plaintiff and defendant<br>petitioner and respondent to be decided<br>by judges who are distant both socially<br>and spatially from the parties who<br>disagree<br>these are good things when you're<br>prosecute Prosecuting will for speeding<br>but not so good when you're mediating<br>good faith disputes between concerned<br>citizens over issues that matter deeply<br>to them<br>I'm sorry to say that in my work on<br>religion and constitutional law I've<br>observed as much bad as much Bad Karma<br>as good<br>constitutional law does not necessarily<br>create disputes over religion but it<br>doesn't play a benign role either<br>my research reveals that law has the<br>capacity to harden and deepen disputes<br>turning local disagreements over<br>particular actions into high profile<br>high stakes zero-sum legal battles over<br>what religions what religion is and how<br>to make it free<br>my work shows that the legalization of<br>disputes encourages actors to see<br>Victory rather than compromise<br>the story of Law's Karma does not appear<br>in the usual places we look for law<br>it's not in collections of judicial<br>decisions with their lists of virtuous<br>precedents nor is it in the speeches of<br>lawmakers with their promises for a<br>better world<br>these transcripts only provide Law's<br>official account of itself which like<br>the Merit books of Buddhist Kings tell a<br>rather one-sided story of success<br>a karma-like reaping of drafters<br>intentions<br>fantasies of a better rebirth for<br>society<br>yet to rely on Law's official records<br>only is to see only the tip of the<br>iceberg<br>to view part of its karmic Ledger but<br>not the whole<br>my work seeks a more holistic accounting<br>tracking disputes as they travel above<br>and below the social Waters to test our<br>assumptions about constitutions and to<br>look again at the many systems of social<br>ordering Beyond state laws that actually<br>Define our complex human world<br>let me be clear I do not think that we<br>should give up on our legal system<br>for many things law works well or well<br>enough<br>we need laws against polluting and will<br>speeding<br>yet when it comes to our most<br>challenging social dilemmas those that<br>involve balancing Collective values and<br>goals<br>dilemmas that require us to live<br>Cooperative cooperatively in a diverse<br>Society we need to experiment with new<br>Solutions other ways of doing business<br>nor can we wait either<br>this Multicultural multi-religious<br>future is already here today in our<br>bicultural country<br>new Solutions might start with education<br>if we want to guarantee harmonious<br>Futures it's not enough for us to train<br>our students in law we must also equip<br>them to understand the complexity of<br>society its cultures ideas and histories<br>call me old-fashioned but I still<br>believe that University education should<br>do more than provide vocational skills<br>it should incur encourage students to<br>question our conventions and to see the<br>world through other eyes<br>recently I've been trying to practice<br>what I'm preaching by investigating<br>other ways of imagining law and starting<br>to ask how other groups of humans work<br>to manage conflict<br>for the last five years I've been<br>documenting and analyzing one of the<br>world's oldest largest and yet wildly<br>understudied legal systems the system of<br>Buddhist law<br>this project has taken me to courts run<br>by Buddhist monks and led me to discover<br>fascinating law books written by<br>monastic jurists<br>Buddhist law I found Brokers disputes<br>without no Notions of Rights or damages<br>without jails or retribution<br>yet it's been used for centuries to<br>govern large populations of monks nuns<br>and lay people throughout the continent<br>of Asia<br>what is the legal institutions are not<br>totally alien to our own legal systems<br>Buddhist law has judges and jurists<br>constitutions and lawmakers<br>but the guiding principles are different<br>Harmony rather than culpability<br>Rehabilitation rather than punishment<br>given that these institutions have been<br>around for thousands of years and have<br>shaped the legal histories of about<br>one-fifth of the world's population<br>maybe they have something important to<br>say<br>after all monastic fraternities are some<br>of the largest and oldest human<br>I once asked a monastic judge about what<br>non-butist lawmakers could learn from<br>Buddhist law it was at a monastery in<br>Sri Lanka<br>it was hot and late in the day<br>the monk pointed to a cow that was<br>standing outside the monastery and<br>commented<br>cows don't tell lies cows don't drink<br>alcohol does that mean they're moral<br>I was tired and I Shrugged so he simply<br>went on<br>simply avoiding something does not make<br>one moral he said to be moral one must<br>also cultivate goodness<br>the cow's way of life I came to<br>understand was the way of life<br>encouraged by state law a life of trying<br>to avoid bad things while being<br>indifferent to good ones<br>it's an app simile for modern secular<br>legal systems which Pride themselves on<br>not endorsing any particular notion of<br>the good life<br>yet as another Monk put it just because<br>you walk away from one wall doesn't mean<br>you're not heading towards another<br>if there's been a purpose to my academic<br>Journey so far a Karma that I'm hoping<br>to cultivate is to figure out which wall<br>we're heading towards and whether we can<br>alter course<br>by evaluating laws Karma rigorously and<br>honestly I'm hoping to better understand<br>its place alongside the much wider world<br>of other normative systems which too<br>have their own Karma<br>in the end perhaps I'm looking for<br>another kind of Merit book a<br>society-wide one which counts all Karma<br>both positive and negative in the hopes<br>that we will all have a better rebirth<br>after all after all it's that score our<br>shared karma credit rating which would<br>seem to matter most<br>and if all else fails if our Collective<br>action fails to put good outcomes ahead<br>of bad perhaps we can try again in<br>another lifetime maybe as monkeys thank<br>foreign<br>I am the pro Vice Chancellor of the<br>division of humanities which is the<br>division that has the lucky pleasure of<br>having been in its Ambit and it's my<br>pleasure is the pro Vice Chancellor to<br>provide both a comment on his lecture<br>and a vote of thanks on behalf of his<br>colleagues<br>I'm also a professor of Law<br>and there were a few we side looks and<br>comments to me throughout this lecture<br>and and when I was thinking about what<br>to talk about I did think that as a as a<br>sometime insurance law lecturer I could<br>perhaps spend the comment talking about<br>the complications inherent in the<br>concept of causation but I'll leave that<br>for another day<br>Ben argued that Society understands law<br>as a primary domain in which conflict is<br>corrected that law ensures peace and<br>Order and flourishing<br>and he is suspicious he's suspicious<br>that law in its traditional form may not<br>actually achieve all of those important<br>and necessary things he offers two<br>interesting answers to the question as<br>to whether law does or doesn't cause<br>good outcomes<br>I think he argued first that the<br>formalist conception of the law is too<br>limited that it is binding on us in a<br>way that isn't helpful and something<br>other than or more than law as we<br>traditionally understand it is needed to<br>resolve our social dilemmas we need to<br>understand a more realist version of the<br>law that recognizes its interaction with<br>people that what happens with people on<br>the ground is what matters as to whether<br>the law has it right or not and that the<br>way to understand or think about that is<br>to consider thinking processes and<br>knowledge categories Beyond those we<br>traditionally assign to that camp called<br>law<br>that we need to think Beyond and outside<br>of and in doing so he calls us into a<br>dialogue particularly with the social<br>sciences and I as a lawyer and a lawyer<br>here at otago am very grateful that Ben<br>has been a strong advocate of this not<br>just because of the beauty that is<br>interdisciplinary study but because I<br>think he is being on the mark on this<br>one that lawyers and Society need to<br>dialogue together and when I mean<br>Society I mean all of those others who<br>shared so much light on what's happening<br>with humanity and how we interact so<br>it's a wonderful Ben that in offering<br>that answer you are showing us a bit<br>about what drives you and I want to<br>congratulate you and your colleagues who<br>are here today who've set up that Center<br>for Law and Society here at otago it's<br>an incredibly important center and it's<br>going to do some fantastic work so Bravo<br>the second answer that you gave to this<br>important question as to whether law<br>causes good outcomes or not is to<br>challenge again our conception of the<br>law that perhaps our conception of the<br>law itself is too narrow in that we have<br>firmly embedded it in a Westminster type<br>understanding of the law and that there<br>are other conceptions or systems of law<br>that may be needed to help us resolve<br>our social dilemmas and being your work<br>in particular is highlighting the value<br>that Buddhist philosophies and ideas and<br>legal understandings may bring to these<br>questions about peace and Order and<br>although I recognize it's an it's a it's<br>in its early stage in terms of your<br>research it's another really exciting<br>part of your IPL that you are looking<br>back to what you've done but you're<br>giving syndication of what's to come and<br>I can see huge value in what you have to<br>say<br>it's a privilege in giving this comment<br>that I get to have an advanced copy of<br>Ben's lecture which gives me a bit more<br>time to reflect on what he's saying and<br>it led me to think a bit more about the<br>implications of what he's saying for us<br>here in aotearoa<br>if what he is saying is true what would<br>it mean for us in this land in this time<br>if<br>if it is true<br>maybe our concept of the law or what we<br>expect of it is both too demanding and<br>perhaps too narrow law is itself a<br>social construct it's a reflection of<br>and it's constrained by our beliefs and<br>Norms it's both Norm creating and Norm<br>affirming in an aotearoa a state which<br>Ben pointed out has no written<br>Constitution we readily affirm tutility<br>or waitangi is one of our and probably<br>our principal foundational document<br>and that with it being our foundational<br>document it effectively ought to be<br>treated as carrying constitutional value<br>I've no doubt that that statement is<br>true and our students both within the<br>law school and more widely across the<br>division University are receiving their<br>education in an incredibly exciting time<br>for us in this society as we grapple<br>with what it means to give<br>constitutional weight or waitangi and it<br>strikes me in thinking about the points<br>that Ben has made that our Corridor and<br>our<br>whakamana of the treaty that is our<br>making the treaty count putting it into<br>action might be more effective if we<br>were to recognize that the treaty was<br>first and foremost a covenant<br>in a keeping of Covenant relies much<br>more on virtue and morality and a<br>commitment to the good of the collective<br>than it does on Law and enforcement as<br>we traditionally understand those things<br>the Buddhist monk and his understanding<br>of law and the wisdom and advice of<br>those who are specialists in fields<br>other than the law may have much to<br>teach us about the cultivation of such<br>virtue and Morality In order that this<br>land this fenua this Society can truly<br>flourish with the document as the treaty<br>as a part of our constitution<br>Ben I thank you that your work points<br>this out to us<br>but I also want to say and it was it was<br>made pretty clear by world too it's not<br>just your work that draws Us in and<br>points us out to the importance of<br>virtue and morality that you as a person<br>do you are a person a colleague who<br>demonstrates the strength of virtue in<br>droves<br>and so in my humble opinion<br>your cumulative balance of good actions<br>is inspiring<br>does the law cause good outcomes is all<br>self-respecting law students know the<br>answer to most legal questions is<br>can my lawyers in the room give the<br>answer<br>it depends it depends Ben has<br>demonstrated the truth of that answer<br>this evening and in so doing he's<br>encouraged us to think Beyond a rigid<br>and narrow view of the law to one that<br>must engage with the wisdom of other<br>fields of knowledge and other cultural<br>conceptions of the law in order that<br>good outcomes will follow his answers<br>give rise to further equally interesting<br>questions which as all self-respecting<br>academics know is essential to ensure<br>that a drink afterwards carries on the<br>dialogue<br>our current Humanity strategic plan has<br>this an identity statement we are a<br>community of creative and diverse<br>critical thinkers who explore how humans<br>interact with one another and with the<br>world around them we engage with the<br>past imagine the future and develop<br>people-centered solutions to local<br>National and Global problems Ben I think<br>you embody that mission statement with<br>absolute ease and class<br>in addition to your exceptional research<br>you are a wonderful teacher and a<br>colleague and it is a great pleasure to<br>offer this vote of thanks on behalf of<br>foreign I have the great pleasure of<br>presenting you with this mentor of this<br>evening<br>and to say thank you and well done<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
