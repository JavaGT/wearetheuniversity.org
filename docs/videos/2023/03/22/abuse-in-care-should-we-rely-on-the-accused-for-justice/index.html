Into prison or borstal by the age of 21.<br>If you are removed into care and you have those experiences.<br>If your mother was removed into care.<br>If your father was removed into care.<br>If your parents have been in prison.<br>People can become locked <br>in - to the system.<br>And so they're self-sustaining<br>But they're also intergenerational.<br>You know when we look at our prisons.<br>That is where when we track back<br>that is where we get to.<br>So I kind of actually think we need to start turning things on their head.<br>And to be much more honest about the risks.<br>And much more honest about how people end up in prisons.<br>And we actually do very little to change that reality for people.<br>And the emphasis of government of <br>course is around problematic individuals.<br>Where actually really we need to be, we need to be <br>attending to what the state is doing.<br>In many ways we should be subverting how we think about risk,<br>and to be thinking in a much more<br>collective and encompassing way. So that we think of well what are the risks of how we structure our economies?<br>What are the risks of how we do welfare?<br>What are the <br>risks of how we do Health?<br>What are the risks of the racism and discrimination that is embedded at every single line of our criminal justice settings<br>You know through policing, through <br>sentencing, through the use of imprisonment  <br>Also through welfare, through the <br>removals of children.<br>Those kind of interventions have enormous consequences <br>but we don't articulate them.<br>So it's not,<br>it's not difficult, really.<br>But I think it,<br>it requires a big cultural shift</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
