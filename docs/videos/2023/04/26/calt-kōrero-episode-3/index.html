facilitating this<br>panel discussion we look at assessment<br>now and in the future because assessment<br>is a major driving factor for students<br>behavior and learning it also has a big<br>impact on our teaching and curriculum<br>design<br>we will be taking questions from the<br>audience here in the in the studio and<br>for those watching us online so by all<br>means send your questions through and we<br>will endeavor to answer them at the end<br>of this session<br>joining me a panel of fellow academics<br>from the University and I'll hand it<br>over to them to introduce themselves<br>Kiana I'm Simone Marshall I'm professor<br>of medieval literature in the in the<br>English program and I'm particularly<br>interested in experiential learning<br>Kiora my name's Blair Blakey I'm a<br>professor in the physics department<br>I'm quite passionate about the<br>challenges of education and physics and<br>I really like problem-based learning<br>Yoda I'm Angela Clark from The Faculty<br>of dentistry and I convene the forensic<br>biology summer school paper and I'm<br>interested in assessments that are<br>grounded in real life scenarios okay<br>thank you thank you very much for being<br>here assessment is a big issue and a big<br>topic and we can't possibly cover every<br>every aspect of it but we'll try to<br>raise a number of issues today and then<br>take questions<br>assessment has a number of different<br>purposes of of functions but based on<br>your experience and and your teaching<br>philosophy if you're like what are the<br>kind of the key objectives<br>um that that you have in mind when you<br>when you assess student learning<br>well foreign<br>if I could use an example that I use in<br>my own teaching I teach medieval<br>literature in English literature<br>literature we often use essays as a<br>means of assessment and they are they<br>are great they they help to show<br>students um understanding of critical<br>thinking they get to use and demonstrate<br>their critical thinking um and really<br>show how they can apply the knowledge<br>that they've gained earlier but when I'm<br>teaching medieval literature I also want<br>them to be able to show that they<br>understand the context in which the<br>literature has come from so what I do is<br>I take my students to the Dunedin Public<br>Library so this is my we plug I like to<br>mention that<br>Dunedin has the largest collection of<br>medieval manuscripts in the southern<br>hemisphere so I take my students to have<br>a look at these and it's it's thrilling<br>and exciting and the students get to<br>handle thousand-year-old books which<br>they can't quite believe but then I use<br>that as part of their assessment they<br>have to make a book and then write an<br>analysis of how making a book you using<br>those techniques<br>then impact on the meaning of the texts<br>that they're that they're using so so I<br>try to make the assessment interesting<br>and and relevant to them by making it<br>practical and Hands-On<br>play what are some of the key objectives<br>you have in mind<br>yeah so something about physics we have<br>the saying which is that physics is not<br>a spectator sport and so we really<br>expect the students learning not to<br>learn the ideas but to be able to apply<br>them uh to lots of different situations<br>and that's quite challenging because<br>there are uh theories are very formal<br>and often the ways of solving problems<br>are quite Technical and so<br>um I would like to have a bit of an<br>analogy that I think it's like a<br>musician trying to learn to play a<br>complex passage of music that a lot of<br>practices needed to master those things<br>and so very similarly in physics we<br>often a mini papers will have weekly<br>assignments so that they're forced to<br>apply or encourage to apply those ideas<br>to new problems regularly and and as<br>part of that<br>and applying to the new problems they<br>can see the maybe the Simplicity the<br>idea will emerge and I think often you<br>get that by trying to do it yourself<br>um<br>we even the way there's quite high<br>workload and assignments we give a lot<br>of support to the students so I think if<br>students can come and ask us for as much<br>help as they want and I'd like to think<br>that in the internal assessment our<br>students could often get almost perfect<br>grades but on the other side we have the<br>again using the music analogy the<br>concert at the end which is the exam and<br>so that they have to use that internal<br>assessment to build up the skills to<br>actually deliver on the day and show<br>that they can apply those those ideas in<br>the final exam<br>okay Angela objectives in student<br>assessment yeah in summer school it's<br>quite different we have a lot of<br>students come from a diverse range of<br>backgrounds from across the university<br>so the assessments that I've developed<br>over the years are really about critical<br>thinking or forensic thinking because to<br>be a forensic scientist is to be a<br>critical thinker and a lateral thinker<br>and what the students do is very much<br>like Simone was saying they they work<br>together in teams or like a CSI TV show<br>and they they get dressed up in the you<br>know full white gowns and they use real<br>forensic tools and techniques to analyze<br>and what crime scene and that provides<br>them another really practical way of of<br>of applying their knowledge in that<br>situation and they're not but so<br>directly assessed on what the outcomes<br>are what they found but they learn to<br>think critically and week by week we do<br>a little bit more of that analyzes and<br>by the end of it they've learned how to<br>think and then in the final assessment<br>they are actually tested on that process<br>of thinking rather than anything that<br>they've you know directly learned or or<br>done during that practical session<br>so you you all of you mentioned the<br>number of issues around Innovation and<br>and different types of assessment how do<br>you what are your experiences around how<br>students perceive and accept those<br>because sometimes students need to<br>juggle quite a lot of Assessments at the<br>um so yeah this is something that I<br>think struck me and often in a subject<br>like physics<br>my experience of coming through as being<br>a student might be quite different from<br>an average student and<br>I had a recent experience where I took a<br>paper and a discipline I became a<br>student game I learned a Mari paper and<br>as a novice and a non-expert at that<br>subject it gave me a new awareness of<br>how challenging even quite simple<br>assignments can be and I remember those<br>one assignment pronouncing some place<br>names<br>if you're an expert you think they'll<br>take five minutes to record yourself<br>doing this but as a non-expert half a<br>day disappeared and that made me reflect<br>on how I set assignments for my students<br>and I think it's a really valuable<br>process for us to go through it's taking<br>a step back from where we're expert and<br>maybe appreciating some of the<br>challenges students wear yeah I've<br>gained a similar appreciation I've just<br>started the Maori Society paper this<br>semester and I feel exactly the same way<br>it's like this is such a good experience<br>to be a student again to understand how<br>and have that empathy for what our<br>students are experiencing it's been one<br>of the best kind of learning Journeys<br>that I've been on to inform my teaching<br>too yeah<br>and I was thinking about how um<br>with the the example that I gave the the<br>that type of assessment how often the<br>students are really uncomfortable with<br>that to start with it's not what they<br>expect an assessment task should be<br>um in English they do expect to write<br>essays and we do it a lot but but you<br>know suddenly you can bring out<br>something else and uh it takes a lot of<br>explanation to to say why it's still a<br>valid um assessment task and how they're<br>going to learn from it what I tend to do<br>is go back to what are the learning<br>outcomes what what explain it to the<br>students this is what I want you to have<br>understood or learned or gained as a<br>skill perhaps at the end of this<br>activity and suddenly they get it<br>they're fine they understand completely<br>why they're doing it then but they need<br>that explanation that preparation<br>beforehand I think yeah absolutely yeah<br>and we do the same in the forensic<br>summer school they have an essay which<br>for the majority of students although we<br>are really Broad in in where our<br>students come from they do come from the<br>division of Health Sciences and essays<br>um yeah and they and they do need that<br>they need the reassurance of what is<br>expected of them without laying it out<br>and giving them a list of bullet points<br>to follow or and you know a scripted<br>example<br>um but given the confidence as well I<br>found whether giving the students the<br>confidence in terms of<br>setting out those clear expectations of<br>what is actually required of them and<br>our essay is actually a reflective essay<br>assignment and getting students to<br>understand that it's not a matter of<br>just regurgitating a specific science<br>but it's actually their own opinion<br>matters and giving the students that<br>Authority into for their own learning<br>and education I think and they find it<br>from thinking about how we know it works<br>the students really<br>um feedback very positively about an<br>essay and although at the beginning of<br>the semester they might moan and groan<br>that that's all they have to do<br>um you know on student evaluations I've<br>had comments going you know the essay<br>has been the highlight of the course you<br>know and it's like well when is an<br>assessment the highlight of the course<br>must be doing something right here so<br>yeah I mean it's good to get that<br>validation you know even in a subject<br>like physics Beyond those standard<br>assignments we've had more Innovations<br>and and so now in some of our papers<br>you'll develop and present posters give<br>presentations write a a mock Journal<br>article and this for our students they<br>feel quite uncomfortable doing that so<br>yes motivating it to them and also<br>telling them things like what we hear<br>from graduates afterwards about the<br>skills they wish they had more of yes<br>and I think those things are really<br>important and but it also makes students<br>a little bit uncomfortable and it's up<br>to us to help them understand why we're<br>doing it absolutely and giving them some<br>feedback from professionals as well so<br>you know not only recent graduates but<br>then people that are the employers for<br>those people what what do they actually<br>want in in their new recruits coming<br>through I think it's really valuable and<br>if you can show the students that these<br>are the skills that employers actually<br>need in you and this is why this<br>assessment is trying to help you achieve<br>that skill it kind of just makes sense<br>in some ways we we have a a similar<br>scenario with some of our more senior<br>students postgraduate honors level where<br>we might get them to do things like<br>write a research essay and present a<br>poster and give a presentation or<br>something like that where it's almost<br>like um vocational training if they're<br>looking at an academic career and you<br>know they've never done this sort of<br>thing before but they suddenly realize<br>okay this is actually what you do to<br>become a lecturer potentially and it<br>makes sense to them they see why they're<br>doing it then and they they go with the<br>the feeling of uncomfortableness<br>so I think that message kind of what my<br>understanding is that you pay we as a<br>teacher needs to know why we assess in<br>the way we do we need a variety of of<br>assessment tasks so we we make sure that<br>we covered knowledge as well as the many<br>different skills communication skills<br>and technical skills and and convey<br>those to students we be upfront and<br>explain and get a buy-in from the<br>students and don't just assume that<br>students know why an essay is important<br>or a lab report is important or<br>calculations are important we need to<br>spell it out and get them on board and I<br>think it's really great to be bold and<br>try some new things and sometimes we can<br>just get stuck into a pattern but<br>um it is it's nice to try things and<br>look to see what colleagues are doing in<br>different areas absolutely I mean I I do<br>always keep coming back to my learning<br>outcomes for a particular class and but<br>but try to look at it afresh so that I<br>think well this is a learning outcome I<br>think is important<br>what can we do to get to that learning<br>outcome and suddenly the the world opens<br>and you can realize you can do anything<br>you've got a particular space you've got<br>to teach in we often don't get to<br>determine that but within that space you<br>can do whatever it takes to to get your<br>students to achieve that learning<br>outcome if it means you have to stand on<br>a table and get them to do a tap dance<br>or something um if that if that achieves<br>the learning outcome then it's it's<br>absolutely fine and I I quite like<br>starting from that point of view where<br>you everything is possible for it for a<br>moment there and then you start to sort<br>of narrow it down and it allows you to<br>be Innovative absolutely let's move a<br>little bit towards kind of some Identify<br>some challenges in terms of assessment<br>and assessing student student work<br>I think I mean there are many different<br>challenges and you can raise the ones<br>you think are are important<br>but<br>one one challenge is is around feedback<br>things are and about in around<br>Innovation too so<br>some we're here for some colleagues that<br>it's kind of it's risky to innovate it's<br>a risky to to try new things there might<br>be kind of a pushback from students what<br>are kind of your your views around that<br>perceived risk in teaching and some<br>colleagues May remain very risk averse<br>and say well I'm not going to try that<br>are there any strategies<br>little thoughts around around that<br>advice<br>I often like<br>when we look at the changes happened in<br>our department actually often it's come<br>from people who've come from outside and<br>they've seen different things they do it<br>and they showed other staff that it can<br>work and students enjoy and I think<br>that's often a really good way to allow<br>change to happen and when you have new<br>staff coming in who do have new ideas we<br>should foster that we should encourage<br>them we shouldn't try to say no it's<br>always been done this way and I and I<br>think it's good to have a culture in<br>your area where you are open to new<br>things and Innovation and and there's<br>always a risk with this but I think we<br>support<br>our colleagues to do that it's going to<br>be a good thing<br>we've had in the humanities over the<br>past few years teaching circles which<br>has been managed and looked after by<br>hedc which is wonderful<br>um and it's it's a very informal<br>scenario where academics who have<br>volunteer because they're interested get<br>together every so often of every week or<br>two weeks or a month for a cup of coffee<br>and just talk about their teaching to<br>each other just share ideas say well I<br>did this this week it worked really well<br>or it didn't work very well and just to<br>share ideas and I think that achieves<br>the same thing that you're talking about<br>Blair that that you start to hear what<br>other people are doing elsewhere and<br>realize oh I could do that in my<br>teaching that might be interesting yeah<br>I think we tend to do that more around<br>research rather than around teaching<br>that's right yeah that's part of the<br>idea of having those this forum here or<br>something to raise that that possibility<br>of also talking about teaching yeah I um<br>had a person tell me some years ago that<br>in our research we're we're really quite<br>happy if we had problems because that's<br>what we investigate we like to research<br>problems and come up with Solutions or<br>responses to those problems and we<br>forget that it's also okay to have<br>problems in our teaching which you then<br>investigate and and engage with and come<br>up with Solutions too and I I quite like<br>that idea it reminds you that it's okay<br>to have problems and discuss them with<br>others and come up with new ideas from<br>them absolutely yeah one of the major<br>um issues I guess we've we've been<br>facing over<br>um increasingly over the last few years<br>is dealing with student pastoral care in<br>our in our studies and so we we've been<br>dealing with that increasing challenge<br>over over the years and it's it's been<br>interesting of the joy developments um<br>that have been made to Foster that<br>within the teaching staff and I think<br>it's about learning<br>hat what again going back to that point<br>that you made Blair around learning the<br>challenges students are facing whether<br>that be with what they're doing in the<br>teaching environment or what challenges<br>they have outside in the in the big wide<br>world as well and I think the more<br>empathy that we can have as teachers the<br>more work that we reflect on what we're<br>doing and how we're teaching creates a<br>better more supportive learning<br>environment and you know we can only<br>um you know do our best and and just<br>make small improvements year on year<br>when we're when we're doing that and I<br>guess feedback is crucial and discussion<br>is crucial to those improvements<br>something I've found quite useful in our<br>department is often after our examiner's<br>meeting at the end of semester you're<br>very acutely aware of how your paper<br>went how they went in the exam and of<br>course by the time the next year rolls<br>around you've forgotten<br>but that's actually the time to have a<br>good discussion with other like in some<br>of their larger courses where it's team<br>talk discuss then like what should we do<br>differently yeah and don't be scared to<br>try if something's occurred twice in a<br>row and you think no that's not working<br>let's change it and that's actually the<br>best time to try and do it because<br>you're fully aware of how it's gone and<br>it's quite easy to think of that point<br>oh well got through it pack it away but<br>actually that's the right time to be<br>thinking about changes yeah yeah yeah in<br>my in my field I'm quite fortunate that<br>a lot of<br>um guest lecturers during the summer<br>school are actually professional experts<br>in the field around New Zealand and I<br>often have discussions with them two of<br>them are actually teach teachers at the<br>police College in Wellington so they<br>train all our forensic scientists coming<br>out of the police force and I they they<br>are Hands-On teaching during the summer<br>um course as well and I often do that as<br>soon as kind of we've we've done our<br>tutorial we we sit down and go right<br>what do we need to do for next year you<br>know and have that immediate discussion<br>and make those plans right there and<br>then and I find it really invaluable to<br>have<br>um not just that discussion with other<br>teachers but from people doing that in<br>real life going well you know that's not<br>actually a real thing that might happen<br>you might need to like tweak that up<br>slightly like CSI TV not actually real<br>life<br>um and so you know making improvements<br>all the time yeah fantastic any other<br>kind of challenges you you came across<br>in terms of assessment and well-being of<br>students find an exam stress so one one<br>small Innovation I made and I talked at<br>the start about some of courses where<br>they have these weekly assignments and<br>I'm also mindful that if you're a<br>physics student you're probably taking<br>other physics papers which have weekly<br>assignments you're probably taking math<br>papers that are weekly assignments and<br>so on my reflection from from taking my<br>Murray language paper<br>um what I decided to do was sort of<br>alternate between a normal sort of<br>written assignment and something that<br>was a bit lighter which gave them a<br>chance to practice but maybe it's more<br>like a Blackboard quiz where they can<br>have multiple attempts and it was as I<br>say a chance to practice but it wasn't<br>overbearing and so the idea is that<br>they're not going to have a high<br>workload every week<br>um but we're still encouraging them to<br>do things<br>what do you think about the possibility<br>of having something like that assessment<br>that is not summative so there are no<br>marks involving only formative foreign<br>how do you think that might be perceived<br>by students well there's certainly<br>something we use so we also have a<br>weekly problem solving session with<br>students come along and what's been two<br>hours doing problems where there's no we<br>don't check that the right at the end<br>but we're going around and making sure<br>they're doing and practicing the things<br>and you say they uh you might say<br>they're getting their assessment for<br>participating in this and it's their job<br>to make sure they're learning in this<br>but they can do it without worried about<br>getting everything right or presenting<br>everything it's a good chance to have a<br>practice run<br>well we we do something similar in some<br>of our papers where we know we've given<br>them an assessment task that is new to<br>them and they will have never done it<br>before and they are nervous so we do a<br>kind of mock runoff in a tutorial class<br>where we say okay here's the same<br>scenario it's slightly different so<br>you're not actually just going to repeat<br>the task but it gives them the<br>confidence to to then do the task<br>um themselves so there is no it's not a<br>formal piece of assessment there is no<br>grade for it but It prepares them for<br>the assessment task itself yeah yeah<br>I've done something similar<br>um in one of my third year teaching<br>um where they their final summative<br>assessment as part of a research<br>presentation that they have to perform<br>as a as a group but in the previous<br>tutorial session they have to provide a<br>a formative assessment on another on<br>another topic that I'm presenting on<br>another topic that's kind of related but<br>what the key thing is from that<br>formative assessment is my feedback and<br>so that's what I spend most of my time<br>doing during that tutorial is that<br>they're talking and I'm writing<br>extremely detailed feedback for them<br>that they then get immediately to then<br>use to improve their summative final<br>performance if you're like in their<br>presentation but they also get<br>um not just my mark but a peer review of<br>within each other<br>um within their team and also a self<br>reflection and and so there's three<br>parts to actually that assessments and<br>where they get graded so it's self-team<br>and then an external opinion from myself<br>and that's worked really well for that<br>kind of higher third year level well I<br>think this this is a real Challenge and<br>I said at the beginning that assessment<br>drives student behavior and learning and<br>sometimes in a good way and sometimes<br>not in the best of ways and and I think<br>there is an expectation by by most<br>students that every piece of assessment<br>will be graded and that's something that<br>historically wasn't always the case and<br>it's still not it's still not always the<br>case but this that expectation I think<br>is there and and and and and and for for<br>me part of the challenge is how can we<br>develop innovative ways of assessing<br>where students there's a buy-in and they<br>put the effort in but without grading uh<br>everything so there's more learning and<br>less grading it's a challenge because<br>you know we can be as Innovative as we<br>like and we can come up with all sorts<br>of different ways of of<br>um teaching our students teaching them<br>to think<br>um but the bottom line is we have to<br>give them a mark at the end of the<br>semester that there is no that that is<br>the the constraint that we all work<br>under so we have to come up with that<br>and so that will always be the students<br>um uh<br>sort of main factor in the back of their<br>mind so I think they always need to see<br>that whatever they're doing in their<br>their course is leading to that final<br>grade that it's not irrelevant or<br>unconnected so I think whether it's<br>formative or summative within your<br>um your paper if the students know that<br>it does ultimately have an impact on<br>their final Mark then then I think that<br>really helps them and they understand<br>that too yeah I think the particularly<br>through the NCA system<br>the assessment is the currency for the<br>students and that's how we tell them<br>something's important by saying there is<br>it is this percentage of your final and<br>if there is no percentage on it then<br>maybe the signal to many students is<br>that isn't important so it is a<br>difficult balance to obtain and you know<br>and we're in a complex environment with<br>new technologies emerging and and and so<br>that also makes<br>uh you know some of these assessments<br>um now difficult to deliver and and then<br>you know there's a lot of weight it<br>carries in their final grade and and<br>these are issues we have to think<br>carefully about as well<br>I think making this I mean you know<br>student expectations I think making<br>those clear at the beginning of your<br>teaching is Paramount to getting<br>engagement with the students if they<br>understand what's being asked of them<br>and why and how it's going to help them<br>I mean I've never had an issue with<br>assessments being done whether formative<br>or summative if those expectations are<br>clearly laid out to them yeah<br>okay are there any kind of challenges<br>that you would like to kind of highlight<br>something you find challenging in you<br>know fast relating to assessment maybe<br>in your own discipline<br>um or any other kind of challenges that<br>you would like to discuss first<br>so I could maybe talk about some<br>Evolution we've had and and particularly<br>our first year teaching where and our<br>final exams we have gone from a sort of<br>mixed 50 long answer 50 multi-choice and<br>over some period of time we we looked at<br>that as a as a summative form of<br>assessment and the correlation between<br>how students did in those two sections<br>was essentially perfect so we weren't<br>learning more about their abilities from<br>the long answer questions than the<br>multi-choice and so of course we then<br>decided to go down the path of why don't<br>we make our exams fully multi-choice<br>and we've operated that way for some<br>period of time<br>but now maybe in the last few years we<br>started the question<br>when we see those students coming into<br>second year we maybe they haven't got<br>the skills in writing well-formed<br>answers to problems and so we're<br>beginning to think well maybe it's not<br>just about the summit of assessment<br>Maybe by us saying we have long answers<br>in our in our first year papers we're<br>also giving some importance to that<br>skill to the students and so now we're<br>beginning to the pendulum swinging back<br>the other way a little bit we're seeing<br>let's put some long answers back and do<br>we see the difference in the students in<br>second year so that's just one of those<br>things that sort of crops up and evolves<br>over time<br>we mentioned feedback and and so part of<br>the challenge perhaps is is time is is<br>for us teachers yes yeah so so any kind<br>what what what are your experiences with<br>the time we need to kind of devote to<br>assessment<br>have a very clear and defined grading<br>rubric is essential for students and<br>also essential for the teachers grading<br>the assignments<br>um and I think that's really helped<br>especially when you know our class our<br>biggest class size over summer has been<br>196 students in a six-week period so<br>almost 200 essays to Mark within a week<br>to 10 days and then that was quite a lot<br>of work<br>um but that having a very clear<br>um rubric allowed the teaching team to<br>really assess on the same level you know<br>you've got to spread the load so or the<br>quality of our teaching was was over our<br>assessment and feedback was all the same<br>and that we were able to devote enough<br>time to each and every student<br>assessment because we had a very clear<br>um grading rubric that's one thing that<br>we've we've found that's really helped<br>and provide the feedback to the students<br>I had an interesting experience some<br>years ago where a student had had<br>submitted an essay and I had written a<br>lot of feedback on it there were lots of<br>it was a great essay there were lots of<br>things to say and I wrote all over this<br>essay and I remember thinking oh this is<br>great the student's going to gain so<br>much from this feedback and and the<br>reality was the student was really<br>overwhelmed by it and and was quite not<br>not upset but but confused by it all<br>because there was so much feedback and I<br>I often go back to that example and<br>remind myself that that more feedback<br>isn't always better feedback that that<br>I'd probably given too much um and so I<br>I think you know in a similar assessment<br>task today I would be limiting how much<br>feedback I give not because I don't want<br>to but because I know that they're not<br>always going to benefit from too much of<br>it so just you know the rubric keeps you<br>yeah so I I think to give good feedback<br>in in my discipline particularly in<br>finding errors and and derivations or in<br>lab reports it's it's actually can be<br>very time consuming to see where they've<br>gone wrong if it's something detailed<br>but also in lab reports maybe a bit more<br>like something like an essay<br>um it's very time consuming to give good<br>clear feedback and<br>um and sometimes you feel like the<br>students don't pick up on all of that<br>they're more worried about the grade<br>they got than the feedback but yeah but<br>it's important it's there often in<br>setting what we're expecting absolutely<br>yeah I always direct the students to the<br>online feedback yes you've got your<br>grade but you know go to that but go<br>back to the essay you know and just<br>remind the students of that exact thing<br>we we have read it you know we haven't<br>just arbitrarily picked a grade out of<br>the site and give it up to you<br>um you know and we really care about<br>improving you as a as a human being and<br>that's why we're teachers you know and<br>that's why you know we we like teaching<br>and um and so I encourage students to go<br>to that feedback and um and really take<br>note of it and hopefully that they can<br>use it for future<br>for future assignments<br>I want to kind of touch briefly on the<br>on the Blair mentioned the final exam<br>um it's a contentious kind of issues and<br>perhaps we've seen some Trends and with<br>the pandemic<br>um there are some different views<br>whether the final exam is a good thing<br>is a bad thing which it should be bigger<br>it should be<br>smaller it should not only first year<br>never postgraduate level what are your<br>kind of thoughts in terms of the final<br>exam<br>um in terms of its objectives and issues<br>around around that<br>or maybe I can start as some extreme<br>view I think as I said often a mini bear<br>subjects we give the students as much<br>help as they need to learn these skills<br>we encourage them to work together<br>and you know that could lead one to<br>worry about integrity of all the results<br>you're seeing on the way through and so<br>having<br>a final exam and vigilated final exam is<br>really a way to ensure you know if we're<br>giving them a grade that that's<br>reflecting what they're capable of and<br>indeed we often have minimum exam Mark<br>so even if their internal is quite High<br>you must score let's say 30 in the final<br>to pass and that really gives the<br>motivation to the students they have to<br>learn yes you get as much help but you<br>have to be able to do it on the other<br>hand<br>we've all met students who fall to<br>pieces and exams and you know that<br>you're not getting a reflection of who<br>they are and so that's that's this<br>balancing and I don't know the the best<br>solution for this yeah it's a it's a<br>challenge<br>um I think in my field we probably<br>started to move away more and more from<br>exams because in our field we feel like<br>why is a particular time constraint a<br>good measure of whether they've<br>understood a particular subject area and<br>demonstrated they can apply it<br>um so we do have a lot perhaps a lot<br>more internal assessment tasks where<br>they have that opportunity but on the<br>other hand I come back to what you said<br>there Blair that that it may well be the<br>one piece of assessment where because<br>it's in vigilation we know it is the<br>student's own work for certain<br>so I think it has its place on a really<br>pragmatic level in a very large class<br>it's it's a managerial kind of issue<br>it's very hard to work to assess<br>hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of<br>students quickly and efficiently that an<br>exam does do that sometimes we are in<br>those positions and we we really need to<br>be able to do that so um making those<br>exams then really effective<br>um as as summative assessment is is<br>really important yeah yeah I think I<br>found with our final exam over the past<br>couple of years<br>um especially during covert when we made<br>things open book I kind of changed the<br>exam structure to be focused on quality<br>rather than quantity so I reduced both<br>um the number of questions for short<br>answer reduce the number of<br>topics covered within the exam and and<br>then Focus just on two long answer<br>questions and you know in a couple of<br>short answer questions to really help<br>the students focus and instead of them<br>you know they were telling me they were<br>just so overwhelmed you know they've<br>done all of this stuff in the last six<br>weeks it's so much to revise when there<br>they have basically four days between<br>the end of semester and when they're<br>exam is<br>um and so I heard them and and really<br>just peeled it back and I was a bit<br>worried at the time go announcing to<br>them well this lecture is not going to<br>be in the exam and then walk into an<br>empty lecture theater<br>um but you know thankfully that didn't<br>happen and they you know still attended<br>the course as usual and so I'm I'm not<br>afraid of saying that anymore and I'm<br>not not afraid of standing up at the<br>front of the lecture going just listen<br>to me you know you don't have to learn<br>everything I'm saying you're not going<br>to be directly assessed on the content<br>today but this is really useful and key<br>information to your holistic<br>understanding I guess and that's and<br>that's really improved teaching and<br>improves student experiences that you<br>don't have to assess everything you know<br>and it goes back to I guess what Simone<br>opened with which is like our key really<br>is you go back to those learning<br>objectives those learning outcomes it's<br>about<br>how you want them to to learn not<br>necessarily what you need them to learn<br>but of course that depends entirely on<br>the subject area as well that's right<br>but yeah but speculating a bit about the<br>new future do you think that you know<br>the AI technology that we kind of we<br>can't completely ignore here do you<br>think that that might have any any very<br>any effect on on essays on find maybe<br>final exams will make a bit of a<br>comeback because it's it's a safe<br>assessment environment what are your<br>thoughts concerns or maybe if you can<br>show if there if you had any<br>conversations with colleagues in the<br>department I feel like it's certainly<br>some of the discussions of us moving to<br>more online exams seem to have reversed<br>as those Technologies come out and I<br>think we we're really struggling to know<br>what the future is going to look like<br>and and<br>um so I I won't try and predict what's<br>going to happen but but I also have some<br>faith that at higher levels our students<br>they generally have a lot of Integrity<br>um when we put them under too much<br>pressure and they've got too much<br>workload<br>they might sometimes<br>make use of things they shouldn't and so<br>I think it's part partly we've got to<br>understand what we're requiring of them<br>but I think as we get to second and<br>third year students<br>um I'm hopeful this won't be a huge<br>problem<br>I did when I heard about all the AI<br>platforms online was right in my essay<br>question and my task and to see what the<br>outcome was and<br>um with our reflective essay assignments<br>you know the critical<br>um sorry the creative part of the essay<br>was done by AI beautifully really well<br>but what is really key about our<br>assignment is personal reflection and<br>that's something for the AI models could<br>try to generate for you but I'm hopeful<br>that you know next year when we come<br>back to this is that that we will be<br>able to tell although you know we change<br>our the way that we<br>um have that grading rubric to to assess<br>specific parts of that reflection to<br>make it seem make it make the<br>acknowledge what the student's actually<br>saying rather than a computer generated<br>but as blessed we can't know what the<br>future really is at the moment it is<br>interesting that the examples that we've<br>each given of our assessment are ones<br>that actually wouldn't be easily<br>reproducible by AI their their<br>practical involvement and and actually<br>doing tasks that that you then need to<br>see what student has learned from them<br>um that's very hard to replicate so it<br>could well be that we start doing more<br>of these sorts of things<br>um<br>and yes maybe we'll do more exams or<br>presentations again are another thing<br>that are<br>difficult to<br>do anything other than just stand up and<br>do them<br>so maybe we will see more of that but I<br>um<br>I suspect we will all accommodate this<br>as time goes by I don't know if I'm<br>being naive here but I I look at our<br>maths department and they still exist<br>despite the the invention of calculators<br>and they're fine and I suspect that this<br>will be the case with with AI or I hope<br>so maybe I'm naive yeah I agree I think<br>we often we like to see these doomsday<br>scenarios whether it's you know various<br>things have come up in history and that<br>was the end of higher education and it<br>hasn't happened<br>um and I think really important thing we<br>do is we create an interesting learning<br>environment and of course there'll be<br>Evolution we will evolve and we just<br>have to keep our eyes open what the best<br>thing to do is yeah<br>okay on this positive note let's<br>pass it on for some questions from from<br>the audience here in the studio or<br>online if you have any questions or<br>issues or things you would like to ask<br>or that ask the<br>yes<br>Kia Ora thank you for your korero<br>I have a question for you all about if<br>I guess assessment wasn't a factor and<br>funding wasn't a factor<br>what would be one of your big dream<br>assignments or lecture Workshop<br>opportunities in your respective fields<br>something kind of out of the box that<br>that's a good question I'm happy to<br>speak first<br>um<br>I kind of partly doing that I like I'm<br>quite excited by your question because<br>I'm like yeah I actually get to do that<br>but what I would do is make it more<br>focused on my own expertise which is<br>forensic anthropology so I I look at<br>human skeletal remains and I'd love to<br>run some form of<br>um methodology interactive course where<br>we would actually go into an area<br>um and um and do some practical work I<br>mean a lot of forensic science is not<br>well a lot of forensic Sciences in the<br>lab my kind of forensic science is out<br>in the field<br>um so that's what I'd love to do is is<br>really do some simulated real life<br>experiences<br>um for students that's that's where the<br>real for me that's where the real<br>learning takes place<br>so I think<br>um in my area<br>maybe to let things be more project<br>driven and research like so<br>going beyond the basics we can teach<br>them let you know take them into the<br>labs to follow up with experiments which<br>are not just one-off things but things<br>you can come back to every week in<br>advance and more and more so something<br>like that I think is a great learning<br>opportunity<br>um not really compatible with with how<br>our lower level courses are but but to<br>really I mean I do like those ideas of<br>self-driven Student Activities where<br>they can take it and Advance it<br>themselves I think that's where you<br>um and and my field again a bit a bit<br>like you um Angela that I kind of am<br>already doing that by getting my<br>students to make a book it's very<br>exciting I think it's thrilling<br>um<br>um but but I'm also aware that they get<br>the very bare minimum at the moment<br>because of the constraints of of how our<br>semesters are designed and we do we have<br>to work within that<br>um it would be great to be able to do<br>more than that you know when I have my<br>students looking at a medieval book they<br>don't get to learn the language with me<br>because there just isn't time I would<br>love to be able to teach them the range<br>of different early medieval languages<br>that they they<br>um could be using when they're looking<br>at these texts um there's an entire<br>field of patiography a handwriting<br>analysis which I occasionally get to<br>teach with the odd person who who wants<br>to do this but usually that's in my own<br>time because it doesn't really fit into<br>a university framework easily it's um<br>fascinating it's thrilling you know it<br>really is it really is that whole I<br>opened an ancient book and discovered<br>the secret to something magical<br>um and it's it's marvelous but it's a<br>it's a Time Factor actually just trying<br>to compress that into a semester is<br>really really difficult<br>okay we have a question here from online<br>so group work and group learning and<br>assessment seems to be increasingly<br>common how do students learn the<br>boundaries of group learning versus<br>collusion and those types of breaches of<br>academic integrity<br>so let's talk a little bit of academic<br>maybe I'll start because I don't have<br>much to say<br>I mean I the moment there's one course I<br>teach with with some group work in it<br>and mainly involves the students solving<br>problems together then presenting but<br>they ultimately will independently write<br>something that's assessed<br>I know in other<br>when there's more extensive projects and<br>some other things we we do in the<br>department then the the group work is is<br>a really important part of that but of<br>course assessing that in a Fair Way can<br>be quite challenging I think the<br>students have to learn a lot because<br>they're also learning about the Dynamics<br>of a group and and things like that so I<br>feel I always feel with group work it's<br>one of those tricky things we we should<br>be doing more<br>um also a little bit scared of how to<br>make it work well yeah yeah it is it is<br>difficult because ultimately when we<br>assess students we have to give each<br>individual a Mark we we are constrained<br>by that but we also know that when we<br>look at say the The Graduate surveys<br>from students often the feedback will be<br>you know those surveys are done a couple<br>of years out from graduation and they'll<br>often give the feedback or say I didn't<br>learn very much group work and I needed<br>it they're discovering in the workplace<br>that that's a really valuable skill so<br>finding the balance where you can<br>actually do that group work of in an<br>effective way but still give students<br>the the individual marks that we're<br>obliged to give them is is really<br>challenging I I think you're probably<br>doing that already though yeah yeah I<br>think we are I um because we don't<br>actually have any Assessments in summer<br>school that hinge on the group work so<br>the group workers are very as they do it<br>over five weeks and it's a practical<br>aspect that they they run with and they<br>work together and they need to solve the<br>mock mystery over the six weeks<br>um because they do get asked on who done<br>it essentially in their exam<br>um and provide their own personal<br>interpretations and some of them and and<br>they also are asked to reflect on<br>the process of analyzing that what crime<br>scene and sometimes they will say in<br>their exam<br>answer well my group thought this but I<br>never did I was always a single Voice<br>who thought it was you know these people<br>instead and you know and that to me<br>shows great reflection that they've<br>actually not just gone with their group<br>they've worked with their group they've<br>understood group dynamics but they've<br>actually had an independent opinion so<br>it's it's just facilitated<br>um they're learning so yeah they haven't<br>really they've learned the skills around<br>how to work as a team but yeah they<br>haven't been adversely affected and I<br>think that's one of the things that<br>students worry the most of yes<br>um and in my third year teaching where<br>they do have to do the group<br>presentation the ability to provide<br>um Team feedback to me that is private<br>to me that I I see and I ask each<br>individual member to<br>to basically give their team mem other<br>team mates a grade themselves and it's<br>amazing how many times students are all<br>actually surprised me because they will<br>give themselves a lower Mark a lower<br>deserving Mark than the other people in<br>their group when they say well actually<br>I didn't do very much I didn't attend<br>any of the meetings they just like wrote<br>the script and I read it on the day and<br>I'm like wow that's actually pretty<br>pretty amazing that's fascinating<br>because you think with that that it<br>could go the other way right yeah and<br>often the students really surprise us<br>actually they're very absolutely<br>generous in that way yeah so I think<br>having that kind of peer feedback<br>mechanism makes them all just to feel a<br>little bit more comfortable about the<br>fact that if somebody's not pulling<br>their weight in the team they won't be<br>penalized for it and I think that's one<br>of the major concerns when you get group<br>assessments but would you for for<br>presentation for example would you give<br>the same Mark I mean the marks are<br>individuals but you can give all<br>students in the group the same marketing<br>and avoid that issue in that way whether<br>or not they contributed<br>to an equivalent level that's a<br>different question but would you give<br>them the same Mark or would you<br>differentiate<br>but that's why I think uh Angel's<br>suggestion is really great because<br>actually something that really upsets<br>students is if someone didn't do<br>anything yeah that that's that is<br>something that will really upset<br>students so I think you've got to have<br>some some ability to compensate yeah<br>when I was a student I was told that<br>It's Tricky<br>how did you feel about it<br>I don't know now I think the person who<br>said it might might have been right but<br>yes but certainly there's a degree there<br>of unfairness<br>um yeah fairness is a really important<br>factor in in designing assessment tests<br>students need to know that they are<br>being assessed fairly and so I think we<br>can't ignore that yeah in our assessment<br>tests<br>um I have another<br>um little example though with group work<br>which I've found interesting<br>um I have used group work in my teaching<br>in various times for various tasks but I<br>very rarely assess it so the students<br>will have to work in a group to to do<br>some particular task whatever it might<br>be and<br>um then perhaps go and do an assessment<br>task individually where they they get<br>their their results but interestingly<br>I've made the mistake in the past of not<br>not always framing it quite right for<br>them because they might get to the end<br>of the semester and say oh we didn't get<br>to do any group work but but you were<br>there doing it I saw you doing it but of<br>course they're not registering that<br>because they weren't assessed on it and<br>it doesn't mean I feel I should have<br>assessed but I think I should have<br>explained that better to say yes we are<br>doing group work it is happening right<br>here these are the skills but I'm not<br>going to assess you on we found exactly<br>the same thing where we started<br>innovating putting some group working in<br>places and then the feedback at the end<br>the students don't realize and I think<br>you've got to make the point that we are<br>doing this this is a skill we expect you<br>to get and not just assume that they<br>will yeah they will know it yeah I think<br>that's one of the worst things you can<br>do with teaching is make assumptions on<br>what the students understand about what<br>you're doing I think yeah it's about<br>it's really good to just clarify<br>everything and explain it from from<br>right on that first lecture<br>any other questions from here the<br>audience of people online we've got one<br>hi there<br>this may not be the right space for it<br>but just<br>when talking about assessment what is it<br>you think from the other perspective<br>that of the lecturers and teachers<br>because as you're all saying you got<br>feedback for<br>your students in my experiences there<br>are some lecturers and teachers who<br>totally ignore the assessments that they<br>give to their students<br>so if the university might administer it<br>at the end of the semester that could<br>help them continue developing their<br>curriculum and their teaching styles<br>what are things you would say<br>as far as how teachers are assessed how<br>lecturers are assessed that could be<br>changed or improved or have been<br>valuable in the past<br>um I mean our hedc does have some really<br>excellent resources for for teachers to<br>help improve teaching and of course we<br>all use our teaching and and course<br>evaluations but that's only one source<br>of feedback it's it's important we want<br>to know what our students think but you<br>know you you can be asking your students<br>throughout the semester how are things<br>going you can give informal<br>feedback sessions within a class so that<br>you can make adjustments on the spot<br>um but you know peer review having your<br>colleagues come into your class and then<br>have a chat with them afterwards about<br>how did it go what did this work did<br>this not work I find that personally<br>really really useful because they're<br>they're colleagues who know the field<br>who understand the issues and and the<br>things going on<br>um and and you can just have a great<br>chat about<br>um you know what things work or don't<br>work or what you can change and improve<br>so<br>um I think recognizing that there are a<br>whole range of different ways of getting<br>feedback as a as a lecturer to improve<br>your teaching not not only the official<br>teaching evaluations<br>um and and that using all of them is is<br>really useful<br>yeah I completely agree with that and I<br>think<br>um I see so often that the standard<br>teaching evaluations<br>um particularly the freeform comments<br>are the things often you you interpret a<br>lot and only a small fraction of<br>students provide those and maybe those<br>often have the strongest opinions maybe<br>maybe they're really they really like it<br>or maybe something they really didn't<br>but those are things often you really<br>carry away from the standard teaching<br>evaluations and I think it's unless your<br>class is is extremely large<br>um year on year those can vary a lot<br>even when the teaching hasn't changed<br>very much and so there are so many<br>different ways and often it's really<br>interesting to talk to a student the<br>following year<br>reflecting back on the whole course<br>including the things like the exam that<br>often after the teaching evaluations<br>taken<br>um so I just think it's always be<br>cautious with any single form of<br>evaluation and interpreting the<br>information yeah absolutely I agree<br>um I receive feedback from both you know<br>all of those ways as well and I think<br>peer review for me has been really<br>helpful<br>um from academics and a little bit of a<br>lone wolf so I don't have colleagues<br>that have a great understanding of my<br>subject area so their opinions are<br>really valid for me because they are<br>actually from another area so it's it's<br>good to to have that outside perspective<br>and then<br>um yeah this year I've had some formal<br>feedback from some of the expert guests<br>that I bring down to Dunedin to<br>contribute to the paper and actually had<br>a real really<br>um<br>good expert professional opinion in<br>terms of what we're doing and whether we<br>can use improvements and that's actually<br>how much of the course was based was<br>doing research and going I went around<br>the country and did some interviews with<br>with experts to to formulate to provide<br>the foundations for the teaching<br>materials<br>um and that really set me in good stead<br>then to actually Implement them and then<br>make these minor tweaks year on year<br>based on the huge range of feedback that<br>I gained from what they were doing<br>um but yeah feedback from all forms and<br>all sources essential just having those<br>little chats<br>um I'm always available at the end of<br>lectures and that sounds really simple<br>but you know spending an extra 15 20<br>minutes just present in the room where<br>students can just come and talk to you I<br>find one of the most valuable parts of<br>what I do and informs what I do you know<br>most students students will come to you<br>with issues but I was<br>um I did a brand new lecture<br>um this summer and I caveated that to<br>the students this is something I haven't<br>taught before<br>um and so we'll see how we go and I had<br>a student come up to me and say that you<br>know that was an amazing lecture and<br>they really enjoyed the experience and<br>it's not often actually I think<br>not often at all from my personal<br>experience that students will actually<br>come up and say that to you it's more of<br>the negative critical sign but being<br>having be receptive to that positive<br>feedback was just as valuable as um as<br>the critiques so yeah I can just all the<br>time basically always questioning always<br>reflecting on what you're doing and<br>that's That's the Way Forward I think I<br>think I would like to Echo something<br>Blair said before about making changes<br>when things arise rather than saying<br>I'll deal with that next year and then<br>by then<br>you know who remembers I'm trying to<br>sometimes with assignment for example we<br>had an assignment now which is writing<br>an essay but the students we have many<br>of them colleagues<br>um it's it may not be as obvious to them<br>what we mean by by essay because they<br>used to you know different kind of<br>assessment and writing and so on and so<br>instead of sometimes of explaining this<br>I can add more information in the course<br>handout in in terms of of being a little<br>bit more clear and prevent some of those<br>question questions coming in so I'm<br>using those questions from students<br>about assignments about the assessment<br>to improve the communication that I have<br>on that kind of booklet and I find<br>myself kind of reminding myself I need<br>to do it now when those questions are<br>fresh rather than next next year I I<br>have to admit that I I have an open<br>document<br>which is labeled<br>at the moment it's labeled 2024 and and<br>so as I'm teaching and I finish a class<br>and I go back to my office and I think<br>right something worked well or didn't<br>work well or whatever it was and I put<br>it in the 2024 notes that I look at<br>again when I'm about to teach that that<br>paper again because I will forget<br>otherwise and then you know I have nice<br>big long list of things for for thinking<br>we have time for one last question<br>no okay<br>so if that is the case<br>um thank you very much thank
