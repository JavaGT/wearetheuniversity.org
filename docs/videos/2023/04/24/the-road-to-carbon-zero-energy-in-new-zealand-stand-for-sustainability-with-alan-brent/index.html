Moving to more renewable energy production is crucial, but what does that look like? <br><br>Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington’s Andrew Wilks, Director of Sustainability, chats with Professor Alan Bret who shares with us some untapped locations for energy production and show us how we can move to a cleaner, greener future. They also visit Matiu/Sommes Island to look at the energy systems we have in play and how those systems create enough power for the historic island to function for multiple days.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>foreign<br>is responsible for the vast majority of<br>greenhouse gas emissions worldwide<br>moving to more renewable energy<br>production is crucial but what does that<br>look like<br>today I'm meeting with Professor Alan<br>Brent from the School of Engineering and<br>computer science who'll share with us<br>some untapped locations for energy<br>production and show us how we can move<br>to a cleaner Greener future<br>so Ellen here we are at marketer Wind<br>Farm a great place to be talking about<br>global energy demand and climate change<br>energy is a big deal but just globally<br>how much of greenhouse gas emissions<br>does energy contribute the energy<br>systems by far the most important from a<br>climate change perspective or a carbon<br>emissions perspective up to 80 of it can<br>be associated with carbon emissions how<br>much in the New Zealand context is<br>energy contributing to our greenhouse<br>gases we think about energy and we think<br>about electricity but there's much more<br>to it if you're seeing from a primary<br>energy consumption perspective we're<br>still importing a lot of oil and we're<br>still using some coal in our economy and<br>industrial gas obviously and that's<br>where that's where all the the carbon<br>emissions are really coming from our<br>challenges as we take this other parts<br>of the economy and shift them to more<br>electricity<br>we need to significantly increase our<br>generation capacity in the country<br>obviously we've got a need to grow<br>electricity demand as more transport and<br>Industry moves away from fossil fuels<br>into electricity<br>historically<br>we've generated our electricity from Big<br>power plants with a hydroelectric<br>stations the geothermal plants or even<br>wind farms like this we tend to do them<br>on a big scale<br>do you see that as the future of<br>electricity production in New Zealand<br>the challenges that we face is you have<br>significant losses if you're generating<br>the power fire away from rear where the<br>demand is so in our economy our biggest<br>the demand is obviously up in Auckland<br>and in our bigger cities and majority of<br>our hydropower generating capacity is<br>all sitting on the south island and so<br>what we're seeing globally is that we're<br>moving away from this what we call a<br>centralized big utility scale generation<br>to more distributed smaller scale<br>generation and important on that is<br>we're moving away from the whole notion<br>of consumers to prosumers because<br>everybody in the economy could be<br>generating electricity and supplying it<br>into the grid can I just dig into that a<br>little bit as to what you mean by what<br>is a prosumer so think about any<br>consumer it might be us as residential<br>household owners or commercial entities<br>or even Industrial complexes or<br>manufacturing facilities as an example<br>at the moment they're consumers they<br>electricity is Flowing from our<br>generation to to supply those Energy<br>Services that they need but there's<br>nothing that's stopping them from<br>actually starting to generate<br>electricity themselves and pushing those<br>electrons back into the grid and that<br>means they also become producers and<br>hence we have accredited A New Concept<br>of a prosumer so with decentralized<br>systems<br>whereabouts could we be be seeing these<br>crop up we see the agricultural sectors<br>start playing a bigger role within the<br>energy sector because of the dual land<br>use possibilities so what we've seen<br>globally and and what's starting to be<br>investigated in the New Zealand context<br>is to say well if you have farmland and<br>if we look at problems over here<br>especially if you have more fatty areas<br>there's no reason that you can do sheep<br>farming or your Dairy farming below PV<br>panels in fact it has been shown<br>especially in the summer months to be<br>better for the livestock because of heat<br>stress and so on the animals have the<br>additional benefit of the shade a lot of<br>crop has been shown to grow pretty well<br>under the solar PV panels we have this<br>opportunity of dual land use in in New<br>Zealand where we can do both<br>agricultural production and energy<br>production on the same same piece of<br>land and we already see that with wind<br>farms right I mean after we've<br>constructed the wind farms the<br>this is a good example where we can have<br>a combination or as we said a hybrid of<br>bioenergy solar energy and obviously<br>we're standing here in wind farms and<br>wind resource would be good so if we<br>didn't have the wind farm around here<br>it's easy to put up a few hundred<br>kilowatts of of small wind turbines so<br>obviously New Zealand has a lot of<br>agricultural land<br>do you see that given that amount of<br>land we could we could easily meet our<br>future energy demands as we as we<br>Electrify more of our Energy System<br>that that we've got enough space to to<br>be able to build what we need yeah<br>absolutely we've done the analysis in<br>terms of a new ways data analysis in<br>terms of the resource that we have<br>available on our land but also offshore<br>we were looking at Edwin Farms offshore<br>obviously that's it's better from a from<br>a wind resource utilization perspective<br>if you combine all of those resources<br>that we have there's absolutely no doubt<br>that we could supply all of our needs<br>that we require to transition to a net<br>zero carbon economy but by 2050. they're<br>examples around Wellington where this<br>more localized energy production is<br>happening for a number of years we've<br>seen the system operating over to<br>Ireland uh someone's island in the<br>harbor and I think that's a very good<br>from the Makara wind farms on the west<br>coast of Wellington City we're off to<br>much use homes Island located in the<br>middle of tefanganuiatada Wellington<br>Harbor this is an incredible place to<br>visit and just a short boat ride from<br>our pipita campus Matthews homes island<br>is a predator-free scientific reserve it<br>is also a historic Reserve with a rich<br>Multicultural history<br>matusome's Island belongs to local ewe<br>taranaki whanaui following a treaty<br>settlement<br>it is governed by a katiyaki board and<br>managed by the department of<br>conservation<br>all right so Ellen here we are on<br>beautiful Machu Stones Island can you<br>tell us about the energy systems that<br>we've got at play here we have a six<br>kilowatt winter turbine here this seems<br>like a relatively small turbine compared<br>to the ones we saw out at marketer yeah<br>how much could this Supply obviously<br>it's a little island here it's doing the<br>bulk of the power generation for the<br>island but in a wider Community setting<br>a turbine this big would be how many<br>houses think about it into your Kettle<br>right the kettle is typically about two<br>kilowatts so think about your Kettle<br>boiling for three hours that's what this<br>would do but a typical household you<br>will be running about two kilowatts in a<br>day it's enough power to do for this<br>community for probably two three days to<br>complement our uh six kilowatt wind<br>turbine on the roof space over there we<br>have just under four kilowatts of<br>conventional solar PV panels to more or<br>less it's a similar size than we have<br>with the wind turbine to complement it<br>so but it's very specific we need to<br>evaluate the Southern and the wind<br>resources look over a Thai here based on<br>what the resource would be over a<br>typical year and thinking about our low<br>profile that then determines the size of<br>battery we need and that all happens in<br>in a room over here where we have the<br>conventional batteries<br>storing their energy but a very<br>important tool as well as we have the<br>inverter our appliances at home users AC<br>but the wind turbine and the solar PV<br>panels Supply DC current we also have<br>the hydrogen electrolyzer it's as you<br>see the electricity is supplied into our<br>storage conventional storage and<br>inverters but it also hooks up to the<br>electrolyzer and what the electrolyzer<br>basically does electrically takes out<br>water molecules which all known as H2O<br>and it's listed into hydrogen H2 and<br>oxygen O2 which is released into into<br>the air that hydrogen<br>is uh did piped<br>to this storage we're underground here<br>we have a just a conventional uh storage<br>tank but effectively there's a battery<br>right so this is stored until such time<br>as we need it now a normal Community we<br>might take that hydrogen very similar to<br>the to the electrolyzer we call it the<br>fuel cell detected hydrogen uh in a fuel<br>cell that combines with oxygen out of<br>the air<br>releases of water vapor into the<br>atmosphere and we get electricity so<br>it's very similar to covision metric but<br>what we have an island here is they're<br>not using it for electricity generation<br>inside inside the building here they<br>have a uh just a normal water or hot<br>water heater so that we have a gas a gas<br>water heater in some of our homes today<br>supplying the or servicing that that<br>water heater with hydrogen gas and so<br>they're burning the hydrogen to take the<br>water yeah or burning it in your<br>barbecue or you can move they have a<br>barbecue in here and<br>restaurants<br>obviously the island here provides us a<br>great example of how we can<br>deliver a renewable future but it's a<br>very small scale here on the island<br>what what lessons can we take from this<br>for the rest of the country and<br>potentially the rest of the world to<br>kind of scale it up and and do this on a<br>bigger picture even though this is this<br>is quite a small scale you can think<br>system operating independently but<br>connected to the next Community you can<br>think about this island maybe you're not<br>consuming all the all of the energy at<br>one time you could be selling it or<br>moving that those electrons to the next<br>community and so that's what we're going<br>to see in in the future much more<br>diversity in terms of using the<br>resources that we have available in<br>within our community but being connected<br>and so there's a connection between all<br>these different microgrids<br>utilizing the resources that they have<br>to this disposal in efficient way makes<br>for overall more resilient system that's<br>all right Alan thanks so much for<br>explaining all those systems on the<br>island here yes my pleasure Andrew let's<br>go and catch our Ferry back to the<br>mainland absolutely<br>so we're seeing that here in aotearo New<br>Zealand we've got lots of opportunity to<br>really boost our renewable energy power<br>generation we can take our agricultural<br>land and make that a much more<br>productive energy generating source and<br>we can have local communities building<br>their resilience and generating their<br>own power through microgrids we just<br>need to start transitioning to that<br>future a clean green future</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
