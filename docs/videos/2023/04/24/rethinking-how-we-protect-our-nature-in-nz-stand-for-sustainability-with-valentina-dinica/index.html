They bring in millions of international and national visitors each year, but they were established decades ago and we have to ask if they are still fit for purpose. <br><br>Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington’s Andrew Wilks, Director of Sustainability, sits down with Associate Professor Valentina Dinica to discuss the role of protected areas in New Zealand, what they mean for our ecosystems, and the origins of our national parks and nature reserves. Are we doing the right things to protect these areas? They also visit ZEALANDIA to look into how we can be making more of an effort to preserve a wider range of ecosystems in New Zealand.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>foreign<br>national parks and nature reserves<br>around the world are cherished by their<br>communities they play a really important<br>role in protecting biodiversity and<br>ecosystem services and can help in the<br>fight against climate change but are<br>equally threatened by climate change<br>here in New Zealand we're particularly<br>proud of our network of protected areas<br>they bring in millions of visitors both<br>internationally and domestically but<br>they were established decades ago and we<br>have to ask are they still fit for<br>purpose today I'm especially excited to<br>be talking to associate professor<br>Valentina Danica<br>who is releasing a book on the<br>regulation of protected areas and has<br>been working on them for the past six<br>years and gained some really valuable<br>insights<br>so a very basic question for your<br>Valentina<br>what is the role of protected areas we<br>love protected areas we like to access<br>them to go there to spend holidays in<br>national parks in forest reserves and<br>Forest parks but next to tourism and<br>vegetation actually protected areas play<br>an important role because the 1992<br>convention on biological diversity which<br>New Zealand has signed to obliges<br>countries like us through article 8 to<br>actually use protected areas as systems<br>as policy instruments for the protection<br>of biodiversity specifically nature<br>biodiversity forest ecosystems but for<br>their protection in their full diversity<br>in New Zealand I know we've got a<br>reputation as having a big percentage of<br>our land area protected<br>through national parks and the like<br>often International in New Zealand is<br>given as an example of a country dealing<br>well with protected areas because of<br>this 30 percent but if you raise the<br>veil of this number you see that the<br>protection is not adequate for each<br>ecosystem type like let's say we have<br>267 ecosystem types we should protect at<br>least 20 percent so that it can persist<br>in the future and the genetic diversity<br>and ecological processes are sustained<br>so 20 of everything so right now you can<br>say your New Zealand has 30 but it<br>doesn't have 30 percent of all 20 1968<br>ecosystem it has 90 percent even hundred<br>percent of sun and zero and two percent<br>of others having understood a bit more<br>about the purpose of nature reserves<br>Valentina offered to help illustrate<br>what she means by adequate ecosystem<br>protection<br>but before getting to that I wanted to<br>learn more about the origins of our<br>national parks and nature reserves and<br>why we're not always predicting the<br>right areas<br>so Valentina you're obviously interested<br>in in what the future of our protected<br>areas are going to look like looking<br>back at the history of how we've come to<br>where we are now is obviously really<br>important so could you talk to us a bit<br>about how our national parks came to be<br>and the history of their development if<br>you look at the history many<br>designations specifically for National<br>Parks have been based on non-ecological<br>considerations especially people looked<br>at the scenic and the landscape quality<br>of the areas and perhaps most<br>importantly they had to be not only<br>suitable for tourism but they had to be<br>useless for agriculture Urban<br>Development and Industrial Development<br>no one else wanted exactly the leftover<br>land the worthless lands and if you look<br>at this map we see the distribution of<br>national parks and you see a strong<br>overlap with alpine areas and<br>interestingly if you look at this map<br>you see here the distribution of one of<br>the five types of beaches in New Zealand<br>this is a mountainous Beach and you see<br>how strongly it overlaps with the<br>national parks so we end up with an<br>over-representation of certain<br>ecosystems and an underrepresentation of<br>other ecosystems particularly I'm<br>concerned with Wetlands we have<br>destroyed much of them and what is left<br>is largely outside protected area<br>assistance so the challenge for us is to<br>dramatically increase the ecological<br>representativeness of our protected<br>systems and national parks and we also<br>need to make sure that the<br>representativeness will remain high in<br>the context of climate change when these<br>ecosystems will migrate North South West<br>and West so we will have to re-regulate<br>but also declassify reclassify protected<br>areas to capture this much higher<br>ecological representative it's a<br>fascinating Valentina so if people want<br>to find out more where can they go<br>everything I discussed is actually<br>captured in my upcoming book which is<br>called protected area regulation and<br>tourism science informed ecological<br>Transitions and I recommend what is the<br>range of ecological values and<br>ecological objectives we should examine<br>before making designations and<br>redesignations of protected areas so you<br>mentioned ecological values there<br>Valentina let me dig into that a little<br>bit more what what exactly do you mean<br>by ecological value<br>ecological value is a catch term for<br>what we are trying to protect when we<br>say we protect nature so far our<br>legislation only mentions species<br>sometimes ecosystems these are<br>ecological structures yes we need to<br>protect them but there are three other<br>categories we need to protect the<br>ecological processes sustaining them we<br>need to protect certain critical<br>ecosystems like the climate regulation<br>Services of nature hydrological services<br>and we need to protect ecosystem Health<br>in addition to that we need to Define<br>what do we want to do about these<br>ecological values what do we mean by to<br>protect and we can protect them in many<br>ways by restoring them by creating<br>connectivity by better integrating them<br>in landscape by helping them adapt to<br>climate change which is a special<br>ecological objective to illustrate this<br>to flesh out this idea I actually invite<br>you to join me in zealandia to show you<br>how protecting ecological processes or<br>critical ecosystems could look like<br>I'll never say no to a field trip so a<br>few days later we meet at zealandia<br>arguably Wellington's most beloved Eco<br>sanctuary<br>fortunately it's just a few minutes away<br>from our campus and it gave me the<br>chance to get Hands-On insight into<br>foreign<br>Valentini you've spoken about how<br>we need to be making more of an effort<br>to preserve a wider range of ecosystems<br>can you give us an example of exactly<br>what that might look like absolutely so<br>the New Zealand legislation just like<br>the law around the world is actually<br>biased in favor of vertebrates we love<br>our boots and new feelings absolutely<br>but they are like the the the top of the<br>pyramid and a great example in the New<br>Zealand context would be the liver words<br>these plants are 400 million years old<br>and they have played a fantastic role in<br>the ecosystem first they capture the<br>seeds from the trees so they operate<br>like seed beds for the larger plants and<br>for the trees they also offer habitat<br>for microorganisms particularly<br>invertebrates which in their turn digest<br>organic matter help with soil<br>regeneration soil regeneration is a<br>crucial and soil fertility it's a<br>crucial ecosystem service in addition as<br>you might see that water is dripping<br>they absorb water they play an important<br>role in hydrological cycles and also in<br>providing land stability and protecting<br>against land erosion so these are<br>ecological processes and ecosystem<br>Services which are currently not<br>recognized in the New Zealand<br>legislation so we need a transition<br>towards protecting also the nature that<br>sustains the birds and the animals that<br>we love and liverworts are just an<br>example but as you see around we also<br>have lichens and mosses and other plants<br>smaller plants that provide the same<br>critical ecological services to<br>societies and to Nature itself so that<br>seemed to make sense even though we love<br>our birds and trees they're only a small<br>aspect of a complex natural environment<br>and on that note there was one<br>particular environment that Valentina<br>wanted me to see so I understand<br>wetlands are quite an endangered species<br>themselves in New Zealand not not just<br>from climate change but from land use<br>changes as well and so so going forward<br>into the future of a viewer if you were<br>changing the way we regulated our<br>protected areas<br>what what changes would you like to see<br>to to make sure that we're getting best<br>value out of our particular areas first<br>we need to protect a wider range of<br>ecological values in regulations not<br>only ecosystems habitats and species but<br>also ecological processes ecosystem<br>services and ecosystem Health after that<br>we need to specify what are the<br>ecological objectives or the actions in<br>relation to these values for example<br>here in the Islandia we are promoting<br>the objective of ecological restoration<br>but restoration and damage prevention<br>are only two objectives in addition we<br>need to achieve more we need to achieve<br>connectivity landscape integration<br>adaptation helping nature adapt to<br>climate change and also ecological<br>renovation to establish new ecosystems<br>that may not be native but may play a<br>crucial role for Society and also for<br>climate adaptation of various species it<br>was awesome Valentina thank you so much<br>a really fascinating discussion thank<br>you very much for inviting me and I hope<br>I cleared up some questions that<br>probably kiwis are already thinking<br>about<br>it was now clear to me that aotearo New<br>Zealand has a vital opportunity to lead<br>the way with this type of work<br>if a country renowned for its natural<br>beauty can make these hard decisions to<br>incorporate what we know now about<br>preservation of ecology and biodiversity<br>for the future we can show others how
