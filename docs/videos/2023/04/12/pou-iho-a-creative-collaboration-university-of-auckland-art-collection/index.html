The commission was led by esteemed MƒÅori weaver/artist, Elam alumna, and Waipapa Taumata Rau ex-academic staff member Dr Maureen Lander (MNZM). 'Pou Iho' was co-designed and co-created with eight Waipapa Taumata Rau students from a range of disciplines, including engineering, fine arts, and architecture. The video highlights the involvement and perspectives of the artist, the student makers, faculty staff, and Art Collection staff, and discusses the process and significance of 'Pou Iho' as both a physical artefact and as a collaborative project.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we have an amazing art collection here<br>at the University approaching 2 000<br>pieces that are screwed across six<br>campuses and our role is to care for the<br>art collection and to curate those<br>spaces with the amazing selection of<br>works that we have which are primarily<br>by New Zealand artists and many of those<br>artists have a connection to the Fine<br>Arts school either as students or staff<br>my sculpture has been<br>the way I have discovered who I am over<br>the last 40 or more years<br>I've been making things that Express<br>who I think I am<br>I first became involved in this project<br>when we were doing the rebuild of the<br>engineering building 405 and it was an<br>opportunity to bring in the cultural<br>collections team to talk to them about<br>our vision as a faculty and tell our<br>story by utilizing the art collection<br>and then working collaboratively with<br>students from across the university to<br>build something that was a really visual<br>reminder of where we are in aotearoa<br>what our vision for the future is and<br>where we have come from in the past<br>it was very gratifying having spent so<br>much time at the University to be<br>approached<br>to for for them to acquire some of my<br>work because I know I always enjoyed<br>looking at artwork when I was here and<br>so to come back into this environment<br>felt to me like<br>okay the doors open again let's see what<br>happens what what more can I do that I<br>don't already do what can I learn<br>Maureen has commissioned many years of<br>her life to the university both as a<br>student and as an academic and she told<br>me that in many years of being here<br>she'd walked past this building so many<br>times on her way from Maori studies to<br>elim and back again and she hadn't<br>really felt welcome in the space and so<br>it just seemed really poignant to invite<br>her to create an artwork for the<br>University which will welcome students<br>and stuff so I think it's been a really<br>having taught students I knew that most<br>students if you value what they do<br>and very creative and to work in an<br>environment like the engineering school<br>offered possibilities that I'd never<br>ever had before to work with materials<br>and techniques that I'd never done<br>before that's why I was very interested<br>to work with University students again I<br>just thought well if I don't know how to<br>do something we as a group<br>can probably do it it was quite<br>frightening at first I think it was kind<br>of hard to unravel all of our<br>preconceptions before building something<br>together so we had to keep discussing<br>over and over until we collaboratively<br>came to<br>a final concept that we were happy with<br>it's cool that we can create something<br>with our students and that they do leave<br>that Mark within the University of their<br>time here and they can bring their<br>grandchildren in and their mokopuna and<br>so yeah I helped with it that's powerful<br>it's pretty cool the other thing we<br>actually absolutely needed<br>was a project manager and that was Lara<br>she was absolutely key to being able to<br>do this she walked alongside us the<br>whole way through the poitenua through<br>our understanding of the vision she was<br>there at the opening of the building<br>when we did our Haka working with the<br>students and with Maureen and really<br>understanding how to bring it all<br>together I think that that value that<br>she played and the cultural collections<br>team played in making that work happen<br>was really important it's part of the<br>the cultural fabric of the university<br>and it's what provides the kind of the<br>warmth the color the human elements so<br>we're a friendly Bunch we've got lots of<br>knowledge about our Collections and<br>we're all very passionate about our<br>collections we love to connect with<br>anyone who's interested in learning<br>about what we have and we'd absolutely<br>love to share our collections with you<br>you know I learned a lot<br>okay<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
