other<br>senior leaders I have the privilege to<br>be acting Vice Chancellor today and it's<br>my great pleasure to welcome you here<br>tonight to this inaugural professorial<br>lecture for Professor Julie horsfield<br>um<br>um<br>uh<br>Tennessee<br>welcome I'm standing here under the<br>to give you these greetings<br>uh<br>uh<br>to the house that's standing here<br>greetings and may you stand forever but<br>if not or there's any doubt about that<br>emergency exits are at the sides there<br>should be exits at the rear if we do<br>have to evacuate please follow<br>instructions of Staff members<br>um in a much highly highly hokia<br>turakite Paul<br>to those that have passed um we think in<br>remembrance of you there's some very<br>special greetings tonight uh for Julie<br>because uh inaugural professorial<br>lectures are celebrations and I see a<br>number of familiar faces from the<br>university community here uh tinakoto<br>and members of the Dunedin public are<br>welcome<br>but in particular uh Julius husband John<br>is here and uh online uh hopefully a<br>very large audience either in real time<br>or through recording but we have your<br>sons Jamie and Daniel online uh<br>tenakorua your parents Kate and Woody<br>and brothers Alistair and gray Tina Koto<br>kartor welcome to you all<br>my role is just to sit the scene get<br>things going uh and then I will invite<br>well actually sorry<br>um<br>professors Baxter and gimmel if members<br>of the official party greetings to you<br>both as well my role is to get things<br>going and outline the order of<br>proceedings to you so you know what's<br>going to happen I will say some general<br>remarks about ipl's professorial<br>appointment at the University then hand<br>over to Professor Baxter to introduce<br>the speaker to you Julia will give her<br>presentation which isn't a test although<br>sometimes we will joke is but we will<br>just use this time to hear about the<br>wonderful achievements that have led to<br>Julia's promotion achievements usually<br>in research but the speakers will often<br>talk about the contributions to their<br>Career Development and aspects that they<br>may be particularly proud of in their<br>teaching as well then Professor gimmel<br>will give a vote of thanks and invite us<br>all to a special place for a for an<br>informal Gathering afterwards<br>now ipl's are this opportunity for us to<br>gather as a university community and<br>celebrate the best and the brightest<br>those that have achieved the Apex<br>promotion for Academia that to professor<br>and it's a promotion that is not very<br>easy to achieve applicants have to<br>demonstrate<br>uh significant and<br>world-class performance across all areas<br>that are expected of academic life<br>across research teaching and service and<br>in particular leadership is is one of<br>the matters and and sustained leadership<br>is one of the matters that has taken<br>most seriously International referees<br>are used to Benchmark and Julia in my<br>review of her CV I don't sit on the<br>process but in my review of the CV has<br>clearly demonstrated over her years of<br>performance here at otago her years of<br>appointment here to Target those<br>attributes I'd like to highlight I think<br>as we'll come through Joe's presentation<br>significant extramural funding on both<br>Marsden and HRC having four Pi Master<br>grants and and three hrcs is a very rare<br>achievement so congratulations<br>achieving a Fulbright Fellowship<br>combining that high level research with<br>being an effective and popular teacher<br>and supervisor and in leadership I under<br>I know what she does I sit on a animal<br>practice and compliance Steering group<br>that Julia contributes to and can see<br>that she has supported others and and<br>key infrastructure such as the zebrafish<br>facility here at otago so we'll also<br>hand over to Professor Baxter to give<br>them more detailed introduction please<br>join me in congratulations from the<br>University on your most well-deserved<br>everyone and there's a huge honor and<br>privilege for me to have the opportunity<br>to stand up here today and introduce<br>Professor Julia horsefield for those of<br>you who don't know me I'm Joe Baxter I'm<br>the dean of the Dunedin school of<br>medicine and I'm very privileged to have<br>Julia as not only one of the staff<br>members in our school but also the new<br>head of department for pathology so I've<br>very much been enjoying having the<br>opportunity to get to know Julia better<br>both in her role as someone I work<br>closely with but also in particular in<br>that role as head of department so<br>Julia has a a background earlier in<br>biology and biochemistry and then<br>arrived in the University were targeted<br>around<br>2007 and is now working in the<br>department of pathology so in preparing<br>this brief overview of Julia I looked at<br>her CV and I think Richard has<br>highlighted how impressive that CV is<br>and it's impossible to summarize in a<br>few words Julie is hugely productive in<br>research she's diverse National and<br>international collaborations with a<br>range of research grants and as Richard<br>says as Pi and co-investigator she has<br>been LED significant grants in excess of<br>five million dollars as as Pi she<br>supervised numerous postgraduate<br>students and also made a significant<br>contribution to teaching with a con a<br>particular I think passion and<br>contribution to postgraduate teaching<br>and learning and also contribution to<br>our emerging researchers<br>in terms of service roles Julia has had<br>many of those she was once the associate<br>Dean postgraduate for the Dunedin school<br>of medicine has been the director of<br>genetics<br>otago and has been the director since<br>2009 of the zebrafish facility that<br>Julia was instrumental in establishing<br>and as I said now is the head of<br>department for pathology and I feel<br>quite exhausted just reading this out<br>I want to acknowledge Julia as a hugely<br>productive and contributing staff member<br>so today Julia will be talking about the<br>circle of life understanding development<br>from connections and biology she'll give<br>us some insights and her Focus over the<br>past 25 years on Research that tries to<br>understand cell proliferation<br>differentiation and most importantly why<br>destruct by why disrupting the balance<br>of these processes contributes to human<br>disease Julia and her team have been<br>working on groundbreaking research<br>related to cohesion approach A protein<br>that connects cell division with cell<br>fate decisions Julia and her team have<br>worked on how<br>mutations in cohesion can contribute to<br>human developmental disorders and have<br>also studied links between cohesion<br>mutation and Leukemia these are all<br>incredible contributions not just to<br>science but also the potential to make a<br>difference for the lives of many people<br>and I now invite Professor Julia<br>horsfield to deliver her inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>Tana Koto<br>irana<br>Moana<br>hello everyone and thank you so much for<br>coming along to my professorial lecture<br>and to everyone watching online<br>um I can't believe I'm here it's been<br>three years and three cancellations and<br>finally finally so um<br>I get to try to get you all excited<br>about what I'm excited about which is<br>developmental biology<br>so why am I excited about developmental<br>biology<br>a small ball of cells starting out can<br>turn into a magnificent human being such<br>as this unnamed family member that we<br>see here<br>the sky and this is a truly miraculous<br>process and it relies on two different<br>processes happening and these are<br>the division of cells so cell<br>proliferation and then those cells have<br>to decide what to be in the embryo so<br>cell fate and those are the only two<br>things you really need to make a person<br>make a lot of cells and then somehow<br>turn them into a person and this is<br>pretty miraculous really<br>so I guess<br>it's fun to take a deep dive into what<br>some of these processes look like<br>each cell has a nucleus and inside each<br>nucleus there's a whole lot of DNA<br>packaged in there really really tightly<br>so we're looking inside the nucleus of<br>one of these cells right now and zooming<br>outwards<br>through the nuclear pore to take a view<br>of the nucleus<br>now the nucleus every nucleus in your<br>body has two meters of DNA stretched out<br>packaged inside it which is pretty<br>remarkable and during the process of<br>cell division that DNA gets packaged<br>even more tightly as we have to condense<br>down our chromosomes to divide them in<br>cell division and so that process you<br>see going on here<br>the DNA duplicates to form these<br>homologous chromosomes which then<br>condense and dance around the cell until<br>they line up along the midline of the<br>cell and Pull Apart into opposite poles<br>giving you two daughter cells<br>that's the process of cell division that<br>gives you all of the cells that you need<br>to make that beautiful human being that<br>as you could see from that movie<br>the chromosomes have to undergo amazing<br>morphological changes to give you the<br>ability to separate them and cell<br>division<br>and this is just a still from the movie<br>and I wanted to just zoom in on a<br>chromosome<br>and highlight that this is two sister<br>chromatids so so replicated chromosomes<br>that are held together<br>and they have to be held together like<br>that so that the chromosomes can dance<br>around the cell and then later separate<br>into two daughter cells if we didn't<br>hold them together then the chromosomes<br>would just be all over the cell<br>so there is a protein complex that<br>actually holds those two chromosomes<br>together while this is happening<br>and this is in fact the complex that I<br>work on it's called cohesion I like to<br>see it like this<br>it is the ring of power that does this<br>amazing job of holding the chromosomes<br>together<br>and the protein complex is indeed a<br>giant Circle so I also like to think of<br>it as the circle of life as well as the<br>proliferation and differentiation aspect<br>of the story so<br>this is the main known job of cohesion<br>and if we again look back inside the<br>nucleus and we look at the tightly<br>packaged chromosomes when the<br>chromosomes are not dividing like we<br>just saw they are also packaged inside<br>so in every nucleus this is a tightly<br>packaged bundle of DNA and if we were to<br>make a cartoon of this and this is kind<br>of a textbooky cartoon but it basically<br>breaks down the organization of<br>chromosomes inside the nucleus so you<br>can see<br>I can find my notes yes so you can see<br>each chromosome squashes down into a<br>particular region of the nucleus and if<br>you were to unbundle it a little bit you<br>would see that there are chromosome<br>compartments that kind of a bundles that<br>are then squashed up together to make<br>the chromosome territory in the nucleus<br>and then each one of these bundles<br>is formed by Loops<br>and if you were to unloop the loops you<br>would eventually get to the DNA wound<br>around these histone proteins<br>and<br>then you would get to naked DNA<br>so the protein complex that I'm talking<br>about the cohesion complex acts at the<br>point where we form the loops so if you<br>can imagine this complex loaded onto DNA<br>if we pretend this piece of ribbon is a<br>piece of DNA and the complex is stuck to<br>it how this actually works is that the<br>cohesion is a molecular motor that<br>extrudes the DNA through the loop like<br>this<br>so then if you can imagine you've got<br>hundreds and thousands of cohesion<br>complexes on your DNA what you end up<br>with is Loops upon Loops upon loops and<br>that is how come you can fit two meters<br>dead of DNA inside a single nucleus<br>so<br>that was a deep dive into the science<br>already so<br>I just wanted to back out again and<br>make a couple of points so hopefully<br>this has convinced you that DNA can use<br>its cohesion can use its DNA organizing<br>properties to divide your cells but also<br>the properties that it uses to bundle up<br>the DNA in the nucleus<br>allows particular genes to be expressed<br>in those cells at particular times<br>during development and<br>what I've been working on for the last<br>20 years or so is the idea that cohesion<br>also controls expression of genes in the<br>nucleus as well as does the cell<br>division role and my work way back in<br>the early 2000s was the first to show<br>this gene expression activity in an<br>animal<br>so um<br>I was a baby once here I am<br>and I was as you heard me say earlier my<br>ancestors are from Scotland and this is<br>my mother she's um<br>Scottish and I was born in London and<br>this is me shortly after<br>and you can see I'm not particularly<br>happy in this picture I think it's<br>because I haven't yet arrived in New<br>Zealand so so once I'm in aotearo no New<br>Zealand I cheer up quite a bit and and<br>so alote is where I grew up<br>and the porirua region so I went to<br>plummerton school pauwata hanui school<br>and ourotea college in porirua and I did<br>not like School very much I wasn't bad<br>at it I was quite good at school but I'm<br>yeah you know I just did well but not<br>great or anything and but I love to read<br>and so I read all of the time and um<br>also wrote stories as well<br>and there was one particular book which<br>was a really or series of books which<br>were really good fun in the early 80s<br>and a really good distraction and that<br>was the books by Douglas Adams and I<br>know I'm dating myself here this is a<br>long time ago but I love The<br>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series<br>and also Dirk gently's holistic<br>detective agency<br>and um<br>I learned a lot from these books<br>actually in fact I learned the answer to<br>life the universe and everything which<br>is apparently 42 so I don't know why<br>we're all doing this research all the<br>time because there's the answer right<br>there also learn some very handy quotes<br>which are coming in quite handy these<br>days so don't panic<br>oh no not again<br>and I love deadlines I love the<br>whooshing noise they make as they go by<br>or Douglas Adams quotes<br>and gently though there is a theme and<br>the theme is the fundamental<br>interconnectedness of all thanks<br>so this apparently is a law which I'm<br>going to tell you about<br>and I really believe in this law because<br>it seems to explain a lot of Science and<br>that<br>even the smallest experiments we do<br>every little thing that we do can<br>meaningfully advance knowledge and then<br>seemingly insignificant pieces of<br>knowledge can be an important impactful<br>part of the bigger picture<br>also<br>Douglas Adams tells us never mind what<br>the answer is<br>we've got to figure out what the<br>question is and ask really good<br>questions<br>so something that seemed a seemingly<br>inconsequential at the time that you're<br>discovering it can turn out to be really<br>important and and I think that says a<br>lot about how we plan and do science can<br>we really predict what we're going to<br>find and<br>you know if you're writing Grant<br>applications that's what you try to do<br>but um pretty much every hypothesis that<br>I've come up with has turned out to be<br>so um inspired by my parents<br>um<br>I went to University I went to Victoria<br>University of Wellington for my<br>undergraduate and I was really quite<br>inspired by my mum pictured here<br>standing outside our family business so<br>um went in the 80s they were Growers and<br>my dad designed and built the<br>greenhouses and my mum grew stuff in<br>them and so this says horsefield quality<br>produce a million mites could not be<br>wrong<br>and so mum was had the greenest fingers<br>of anybody she still has the greenest<br>figures of anybody and so I did my first<br>degree in botany but I was really<br>interested in Biochemistry and I wanted<br>to do that at the same time as botany at<br>Victoria University but<br>in those days apparently plants didn't<br>have biochemistry and you could only<br>study biochemistry if you did zoology<br>not botany<br>so I got around this by taking an extra<br>year and I did a diploma of applied<br>science and plant physiology<br>at the same time I finished my major in<br>Biochemistry and then I did biochemistry<br>honors after that<br>and this is me standing next to a very<br>sophisticated piece of equipment it's a<br>fracturing collector I think so<br>this is during my diploma year<br>and that is my actual biochemistry<br>honors lab book<br>so during honors I studied fruit flies<br>and house flies and I discovered that<br>different species of fly have different<br>quantities of DNA in them and that also<br>discovered which I think had been known<br>before but I discovered<br>that not all DNA is made up of genes and<br>some of it is in fact junk or spacer DNA<br>so that was quite handy to know<br>um but what if I hadn't taken that extra<br>year to do a double degree in botany and<br>biochemistry<br>well then Professor Gamel would have had<br>somebody else for his lab partner in<br>stage three biochemistry other than me<br>and then who knows where he would be<br>today I mean<br>so if I hadn't taken that extra year but<br>also if I hadn't taken that extra year<br>more importantly I would never have met<br>my husband John<br>and I would never have followed him to<br>the UK because he decided he wanted to<br>go on an OE and so if I was interested<br>in still staying with them I'd better go<br>really so I went to the UK and here we<br>are in our OE so<br>yeah oh I needed to tell you about the<br>bowl of Petunias I forgot about that so<br>so in The Hitchhiker's Guide a bowl of<br>Petunia's features as a kind of a random<br>object generated by the infinite and<br>probability Drive of the spaceship<br>that's in there and so wherever you see<br>this bowl of Petunias it's a random and<br>improbable event that has causation in<br>my career which I should have mentioned<br>before<br>so I went to the UK with John and we<br>ended up in Cambridge and Cambridge is a<br>great place for science as We Know<br>and I got a job eventually at Adam<br>Brooks Hospital in Cambridge and while I<br>was doing that job I was I was a<br>research assistant job I taught aerobics<br>and this turned out to be a handy thing<br>to do because some of the people that<br>came to my class worked in the lmb which<br>is the lab of molecular biology and this<br>is where Watson and Craig studied DNA<br>and very very famous developmental<br>biologists worked there famous and very<br>grumpy as well so Sydney Brenner was<br>working there and also<br>um<br>Fred Sanger was there at the time<br>so through my contacts through my<br>aerobics class I got another job at the<br>lnb and there I learned to sang a<br>sequence DNA I'd love to say this comes<br>in really handy now but actually not so<br>much yeah so so this is this is how we<br>used to sequence DNA back in the day and<br>and I got quite good at it while I was<br>at the lmb<br>um<br>yeah so but it wasn't this DNA<br>sequencing bit that got me excited<br>though as I mentioned some very famous<br>developmental biologists worked at the<br>lmb at the time and I learned while I<br>was there that there are special genes<br>and animals that actually determine the<br>body pattern of those animals where to<br>put your hair to your your six legs and<br>and your wings and your tail they have<br>particular genes that specify those<br>things and those genes are activated by<br>particular signaling Pathways that tell<br>cells what to be<br>and I just thought this was just the<br>most amazing thing and so the people who<br>were working on this were working on<br>mutants from fly mutants from a screen<br>that have been conducted to determine<br>these body patterning plans and um<br>so they were all really excited about<br>studying how this worked and so I<br>thought yeah this is what I want to do<br>I'm sold I'm going to I'm going to be a<br>developmental biologist so<br>um I couldn't stay in Cambridge So<br>eventually we ran out of money and went<br>back to New Zealand after seeing a lot<br>of Europe and I started a PhD at otago<br>eventually after working at Victoria<br>University and the Mulligan Institute<br>for a bit and I chose otago because<br>friends were coming here<br>and I chose my supervisor randomly and<br>I'm not kidding<br>so I thought well I'll go to the<br>biochemistry Department they're sure to<br>have developmental biology and nothing<br>in there looks like it so I just pretty<br>much picked a guy which was Warren Tate<br>and I wrote to him<br>and said Dear Professor Tate I'd like to<br>do a PhD in developmental biology do you<br>do developmental biology and he's like<br>sure so<br>so um so I went and did something that<br>wasn't quite developmental biology but<br>it was amazing so so here's um<br>Warren and me and my dad and John back<br>when I just gotten my PhD<br>so what did I get out of it I got<br>amazing mentorship from Warren and he<br>was he was just so great a supervisor<br>and I made some lifelong friends as well<br>at otago some of whom are still around<br>today and at the same time my father was<br>doing his own experiment with fish in<br>the lake Ohio Canal so he was the first<br>guy ever to put a salmon raft in the<br>canals of the Mackenzie Country and this<br>is the very first one going in in the<br>top<br>right there and so if you go along and<br>help out you get some pretty good cold<br>resilience and I got some good fish<br>feeding experience as well out of that<br>experiment of my dad's<br>So eventually there was a publication<br>out of my PhD and it was all about<br>ribosomal frame shifting and protein<br>synthesis and that sort of thing and I<br>got right into it and the thing that<br>fired me up the most was the mechanism<br>of the saying that I was looking at how<br>was it working I learned to get really<br>curious about how things actually work<br>in biology what is cause and effect and<br>I also learned that our RNA and protein<br>are apparently just as important as DNA<br>who knew so it was really handy to know<br>that as well<br>um yeah and so caution though because<br>Douglas Adams quotes<br>um that the complexities of cause and<br>effect of Phi analysis so I was warned<br>and it is still pretty tricky to work<br>this out to this day<br>so there was a lot of focus on hard work<br>in the lab and I got my PhD in about<br>three years and three months which was<br>pretty quick but we had a lot of fun at<br>the same time in the lab and so here's<br>one of the fancy dress parties back in<br>the day there's some familiar faces to<br>some people up there maybe but um yes it<br>was very good fun<br>that's my first true love was<br>developmental biology and so I quickly<br>began to look around for postdoc<br>positions that could offer me that<br>training I didn't have to look too far<br>because it was a very good lab in<br>Adelaide Australia and I went to work<br>with a guy called Rob Saint and and also<br>Helena Richardson who was just starting<br>up in his lab and this is Julie Helena's<br>PhD student<br>so while we were in Adelaide<br>we also got into the the kind of the<br>life of around Adelaide so there's a lot<br>of wineries there's three different<br>wineries surrounding wine District<br>surrounding Adelaide I got into<br>Triathlon and Road cycling and so I had<br>to put in this picture because this is<br>the absolute highlight of my cycling<br>career<br>so that's me red arrows there I'm riding<br>on a warm-up race to the tour Down Under<br>And for those of you who know that's the<br>the biggest south southern hemisphere<br>cycling race<br>and this was maybe the second year<br>they'd run it one and and um<br>yeah I actually won the race<br>the guy who won the men's race got like<br>a few thousand dollars I got a bottle of<br>whiskey so<br>I still have the bottle so<br>okay so um what else did what else<br>happened so<br>um<br>I was working in an address offer lab<br>and this was a lab that worked on the<br>cell cycle so<br>um what they were really interested in<br>in the lab is figuring out how the cell<br>cycle and developmental signals interact<br>with each other<br>so drosophila have which are these fruit<br>fly things have these amazing<br>um<br>structured eyes and here's one under an<br>electron microscope this is a normal eye<br>and it's got this beautiful grid of<br>these clones of cells called omitidia if<br>there aren't enough of these cells the<br>fly can't make a proper eye and you get<br>this rough looking eye over here in this<br>particular cell cycle mutant for this<br>protein called cyclin e which you need<br>to get through the cell cycle<br>so in this lab what I was looking for is<br>that anything could modify this rough<br>eye might be something that talks to the<br>cell cycle to tell a cell what to be or<br>to keep proliferating<br>so um<br>I did a genetic screen in the lab to try<br>and find these modifiers as part of a<br>screen team but I also tested some<br>signaling Pathways and how they<br>interacted with this eye<br>and I found one particular signaling<br>pathway<br>so this looks really weird this is this<br>is decapentaplegic and the um<br>the human or animal homolog will be the<br>bone morphogenetic signaling pathway<br>which goes to develop a lot of your own<br>tissues<br>and<br>basically what this shows is that a cell<br>signaling pathway that tells cells what<br>to be can actually interact with the<br>cell cycle and tell cells to stop<br>cycling so that they can then decide<br>what to be<br>so I learned a lot in this lab so I<br>learned about cell division and the cell<br>cycle and I learned about the signaling<br>Pathways that can then feed into to tell<br>cells what to be and I learned about<br>genetic screens so genetic screens being<br>a way to find new genes that do<br>interesting things in animals<br>so at the same time that I was doing<br>this<br>um cohesions were found so cohesions<br>were the proteins that hold the sister<br>chromatids together they had to be found<br>sometime they were actually found a year<br>before I published my paper in Adelaide<br>by this guy called Kim nasmeth and I<br>went to a conference and Kim Naismith<br>was talking about how they were<br>responsible for cell division<br>so that was sort of a coincidence<br>so after Adelaide I went back to New<br>Zealand and<br>took up a postdoctoral fellowship with<br>Phil and Kathy Crozier at the University<br>of Auckland and they hired me because<br>I'd done drosophila forward genetics so<br>genetics greens and drosophila so that I<br>could then do pretty much the same in<br>zebrafish so use zebrafish to find new<br>mutations that would affect<br>particular Developmental Pathways<br>so why would you use zebrafish for<br>anything at all<br>so the reason is because we'd love to<br>know how this ball of cells turns into a<br>a nice human being but we can't normally<br>see it because<br>mammalian embryos develop inside the<br>uterus<br>and so fish offer this opportunity to<br>watch external development of an embryo<br>and they're really handy things to have<br>because a pair of fish can lay hundreds<br>of eggs and so you've got lots of little<br>subjects to look at down a microscope<br>and you can keep them cheaply and easily<br>way cheaper than mice and yeah and and<br>they're very very amenable and robust so<br>here's to fisher breeding and they give<br>you this beautiful caviar which you can<br>see here<br>and there's a single cell here on top of<br>a yolk<br>caviar is pretty special because it can<br>grow and<br>so this is a zebrafish embryo that's<br>going through its first 24 hours of<br>development and you can see the<br>recognizable structure starting to<br>emerge here here's the eye the muscles<br>and the tail<br>Center bit is the yolk so so it's very<br>very easy just to look down a microscope<br>and see what's happening and you've got<br>a really nice model to to look at how<br>you get an animal out of a single cell<br>so zebrafish we're just really starting<br>up and in the 90s and in the late 90s<br>when I joined the slab it was pretty<br>much in the infancy<br>um and so I got to be part of that<br>movement of using zebrafish as a model<br>as well<br>so while I was at University of Auckland<br>we started a family and so it was<br>balancing This research with these small<br>children was quite exciting as well and<br>it was a fun time<br>so at the same time that that I was<br>doing this though<br>um cohesions were being worked on<br>elsewhere so the first whoops<br>the first cause of a<br>gene expression bio cohesion was found<br>in a fruit fly by this guy called Dale<br>Dorset don't worry about the title it's<br>very complicated but um<br>but people were starting to realize that<br>this cell division protein had jobs in<br>other ways as well as just in cell<br>division<br>but I was hired to progress a leukemia<br>project and Leukemia is caused by many<br>different gene mutations but one of them<br>that's well known is the ranks one or<br>aml1 Gene<br>and if you rearrange chromosomes so that<br>you get a break in the ranks one gene<br>this can cause acute myeloid leukemia<br>also if you just get point mutations in<br>the ranks one gene this is common in<br>blood cancers and so my project was to<br>find second mutations that affected<br>rungs one expression because these might<br>so we use zebrafish for this and here<br>you see zebrafish embryos over here<br>very early in development and the blue<br>cells that you can see here are cells<br>that have switched on the ranks one gene<br>and the cells that are in that lateral<br>stripe there are the same cell type as<br>those that give rise to very earliest<br>blood and mouse and human embryos<br>so um out of this<br>genetic screen where I created de novo<br>mutations and fish and then looked for<br>an effect on ranks one I found this one<br>mutation that still had so that still<br>had the neuron expression<br>which is um<br>the dots that you can see across the<br>back of the embryo but did not have<br>these lateral Stripes of expression<br>which give rise to blood<br>so I call this the 17.1 mutation because<br>this was the 17th batch of fish I'd<br>screened and it was fish number one<br>so that's why<br>and<br>when I was looking into what this<br>mutation caused I noticed that it also<br>had a problem with the cell cycle<br>so this is staining of cells that are<br>trying to go through the cell cycle but<br>what's happened is that they've stopped<br>part way through<br>and instead of the chromosome separating<br>you can see in this cell down the bottom<br>that some have gone this way some have<br>gone that way and some are stuck in the<br>middle<br>and these ones over here have got<br>chromosomes all over the cell<br>and I thought I think there might be a<br>problem with mitosis in the in this fish<br>and I wouldn't have probably known that<br>if I hadn't already worked on the cell<br>cycle and drosophila in my previous<br>project<br>and so then after sort of having that<br>hint<br>I embarked on a on a kind of Soul<br>destroying journey of trying to find out<br>what the gene was and it took about it<br>took more than two years so once you<br>have a mutation and a forward genetics<br>experiment you need to be able to figure<br>out what you mutated to cause the<br>phenotype so the only way you could do<br>this in fish was to do meiotic mapping<br>and and that involves running lots and<br>lots of pcrs on a gel and I ran well<br>over 200 of these gels in two years to<br>try and find the interval which my Gene<br>was in when I did<br>I figured out what it was pretty much<br>straight away because I picked the gene<br>that was involved in the cell cycle<br>so in the meantime the first link of<br>cohesion to human disease was found and<br>labs in the USA<br>so this looks like a different Gene but<br>actually there's my Gene which is a<br>member of the cohesion complex and their<br>Gene is a protein that actually loads<br>the cohesion molecule onto DNA<br>so so then after five years and I'm not<br>kidding of no papers I published my<br>research<br>and this was the first instance of<br>cohesion regulation of a gene and a<br>vertebrate the first linkage of cohesion<br>with leukemia and the first kind of<br>knowledge that cohesion can have tissue<br>specific causes of Gene regulation and<br>this was extremely hard to publish<br>because people are like well this is a<br>cell cycle protein why is it how do you<br>explain this Gene regulation thing so it<br>was rejected by probably three or four<br>journals before getting into the<br>development Journal<br>when I did though<br>this guy Dale Dorset who was the first<br>guy to find gene expression in a fly<br>immediately emailed us and said really<br>wow and so one person was a fan anyway<br>so so he emailed our lab and and my boss<br>kind of said oh why don't you talk to<br>him so I did and he invited me to the<br>Cornelia De Long Foundation meeting in<br>the USA where there's all these<br>patients that have Cornelia De Long<br>syndrome with the cohesive mutations<br>underlying them and then at that meeting<br>I met a guy called Antonio musio who was<br>kind of a European counterpart and he<br>invited me to a meeting in Italy where I<br>met Kim Naismith and heard him talk<br>again about cohesions and and so it was<br>sort of full circle around to what I'd<br>been working on in my postdoc and<br>Adelaide<br>so<br>so now we have a better idea about what<br>our complex looks like so it consists of<br>all these different subunits and we have<br>a better idea of how it works to<br>regulate gene expression<br>so<br>just to show you I have another piece of<br>ribbon this time I've got some different<br>colors in the ribbon<br>so think of the red DNA as junk DNA<br>right and this blue piece of ribbon is a<br>gene<br>and then this yellow<br>piece of ribbon here that's a regulator<br>of a gene okay<br>so if you would load your cohesion onto<br>and as I was describing to you before it<br>does this thing called Loop Extrusion so<br>it pulls the DNA through the ring<br>so now you've got a way<br>into contact with your Gene<br>so if you extrude the DNA through now<br>these two that were linearly separated<br>are in the same place in space and this<br>is something that is controlled by the<br>so the other thing that can happen is<br>and combine these things together<br>and so if you didn't have the cohesion<br>complex there you would get more of<br>these other proteins and then that would<br>increase or in some cases decrease<br>expression of that Gene<br>and the other thing you can do with your<br>regulator is take it completely out of<br>the picture<br>so put it in a loop<br>that is now over here<br>so it can't regulate that Gene<br>so this one molecule just by arranging<br>the DNA in the nucleus bringing in gene<br>Regulators into close contact with genes<br>can actually activate or repress them<br>and if you don't have it the<br>consequences are either you lose<br>expression or you can gain expression<br>so now in the lab we study this process<br>in cancer cells and in zebrafish<br>and um but to to get to the lab we had<br>to move down to the University of otago<br>and I I'm thankful every day for having<br>my job at the University<br>um it's amazing working in this place<br>and it's been an amazing<br>um 16 years I think that I've been here<br>but I worked on zebrafish and I had my<br>Mutant and I wanted to start my lab so I<br>was wondering if they had something like<br>this like a an aquarium that I could use<br>for my zebrafish<br>and it turned out that there wasn't and<br>I had to go to the local fish breeder<br>and get a couple of tanks and put just<br>put them in a lab basically so that's<br>the first<br>otago zebrafish facility right there<br>so um eventually we got some tanks that<br>do the job better oddly enough these are<br>smaller tanks so these are just three<br>liter tanks but there's rather a lot of<br>them so so now we have a whole library<br>of fish that we can use for different<br>experiments<br>and so um I won't<br>have time to cover our journey since<br>then but essentially what we do in the<br>lab is<br>try and understand the basis of these<br>human conditions that are caused by<br>cohesive mutations known as the<br>cohesionopathies and like I said you can<br>get increases or decreases in gene<br>expression and many different outcomes<br>in human disease so changes in the face<br>changes in the skeletal structure and<br>and trying to sort of distinguish<br>between two different types of<br>conditions Cornelia de lung syndrome and<br>Robert syndrome is something that the<br>lab has worked on too<br>so if we were to use an example here's a<br>pretty good one where we've slightly<br>depleted a cohesion subunit and you can<br>see quite a dramatic change in heart<br>function in<br>cohesion deficient versus normal<br>zebrafish<br>so there you see the the heart is<br>labeled and sort of blue and the blood<br>as red fluorescent and so using the<br>power of this model we can actually<br>determine what goes wrong in development<br>when we just deplete this subunit<br>and then in cancer<br>so after I'd made that original<br>Discovery with ranks one and ten years<br>later they started sequencing all these<br>human cancers and these genome<br>sequencing projects well suddenly<br>revealed that there were a whole lot of<br>cohesive mutations and many different<br>types of cancer and in particular<br>leukemia so<br>go figure and so now we work on finding<br>drugs that kill cohesive muted cancer<br>cells and so<br>um if you put drugs on cells that have<br>cohesive mutations it turns out that<br>those cells are more sensitive<br>and so some of this work was published<br>fairly recently when we found that a<br>signaling pathway<br>that determines sulfate interacts with<br>the cell cycle and if you over hype that<br>signaling pathway then you interfere<br>with the cells that have the cohesive<br>mutation that controls cell<br>proliferation so so again things just<br>keep popping up that are themes from<br>stuff that I've studied in the past and<br>so all of this research that has been<br>built on in my lab all started from this<br>one genetic screen in 19 started in 1999<br>which is when I started in Auckland we<br>didn't know what we were going to find<br>you don't in these genetic screens you<br>just generate something and then you<br>follow it and you follow it until you<br>can figure out how it works and what it<br>does<br>so in conclusions I sort of want to<br>reiterate that everything that we do can<br>meaningfully advance knowledge whether<br>we know that we are what we're going to<br>find or not<br>and that this takes time so it's taken<br>20 years with this mutant to even figure<br>out what how it's contributing to<br>development and cancer<br>and at the time it was<br>nobody understood it and I think we're a<br>little bit closer but it's maybe still<br>far I don't know<br>and then seemingly and significant<br>knowledge can be an important impactful<br>part of the bigger picture well I can<br>then contend that humans are really bad<br>at predicting impact in advance<br>if we knew what we were going to find<br>why would you do the experiment<br>so so I think then it's even more<br>important to ask really good questions<br>and to never stop<br>asking them<br>last week<br>this was published<br>so the covert virus can restructure<br>human architecture so your DNA and your<br>nucleus can get rewired by a covert<br>infection and it turns out that<br>carbon virus disrupts Loop Extrusion<br>mediated by cohesion<br>and that gives you the expression of<br>genes that are responsible for the<br>inflammation that you get in Long covert<br>so when everyone comes up to me and says<br>why do you work on this stupid molecule<br>all your life well it does everything<br>doesn't it<br>so there you go<br>so there are many important people to<br>thank and I just want to start with<br>um in the black type there or the people<br>who advised me through my career so<br>starting from botany back at Victoria<br>University and all the way through to my<br>studies in Auckland and then in blue<br>there's every one I could remember who's<br>I've worked with in the lab over all of<br>the years and and thanks so much to<br>everyone for being part of this journey<br>it's just been amazing<br>and then all the different collaborators<br>local collaborators that have<br>Taken part in Grants and and kind of<br>also just been around have a beer with<br>and there are people not on the slide<br>that are<br>um also amazing to have a beer with but<br>the font would have been that small and<br>and then I can't stress enough how<br>important International collaboration<br>has been to this study so an<br>international researcher recognized the<br>importance of my Discovery way back<br>um when I was just a postdoc not knowing<br>what I got and it was that contact that<br>that person made with us that oops made<br>everything<br>um kind of Blossom and so I think it's<br>really important that we still remain an<br>internationally connected University<br>with our International collaborations<br>oh and this year and this guy<br>um down the bottom right<br>come on Mouse this guy that's Eric Vish<br>house he has a Nobel Prize for being the<br>guy who generated the first drosophila<br>screens that generated the mutants that<br>they were studying in Cambridge that got<br>me excited in the first place about<br>developmental biology<br>him and Christian Muslim volhart<br>so um there's been cycling over the<br>years as well and I've had a lot of fun<br>with my cycling buddies it's kept me<br>sane and when you're peddling really<br>hard you can't think about anything else<br>so that's really quite good sometimes<br>um some of my friends don't do a lot of<br>cycling but I've managed to persuade<br>them too that's my best friend Melanie<br>Kohler from Wellington<br>and some of my friends I have to try and<br>keep up with down the drop-offs and and<br>single track the um grade<br>three that's really a grade four that<br>I've been persuaded down many a Time<br>and some people I've I don't do any more<br>triathlons but here's one that I did<br>with some people from the Department of<br>biochemistry as a cyclist and then<br>having a lot of fun on the mountain bike<br>as well with the beautiful Dunedin<br>scenery<br>so getting to the end I promise so so<br>um<br>next I'd like to thank my lovely boys<br>Jamie and Daniel so early on it looked<br>promising that they would become<br>scientists<br>um<br>that could see them studying hard there<br>but as it turned out not so much so that<br>they really are art students at Victoria<br>now and I'm so proud of you guys and<br>it's been amazing of you to put up with<br>me all this time<br>I'd love to thank my beautiful whanau<br>particularly my mum Kate and my dad<br>Woody and all of my family are always<br>there and the tough times and the good<br>times and it's been an amazing journey<br>um and it's been great having your<br>support<br>and last but not least my<br>lovely husband who<br>keeps me saying all these years and and<br>has always supported me in every single<br>way and and thank you I can't thank you<br>enough for all that you've done<br>so I just want to leave you with a quote<br>let's think the unthinkable let's do the<br>undoable let us prepare to Grapple with<br>the ineffable itself and see if we may<br>not effort after all<br>Douglas Adams Dirk gently's holistic<br>detective agency<br>all right<br>so I'm Neil gimmel I'm the<br>acting Deputy provides Chancellor Health<br>Sciences it doesn't ever roll off the<br>tongue easily that one uh and um it's<br>interesting that you raised Douglas<br>Adams and uh and the power of<br>serendipity because<br>um it's it's kind of curious how I am<br>here giving the thanks to uh such a<br>wonderful lecture<br>um and Julia and my connection go back<br>uh some some decades uh so um it's<br>actually quite a privilege to be able to<br>do this so the the sort of fundamental<br>interconnect this whole things uh<br>obviously led us to this place and uh<br>not under normal circumstances this vote<br>of thanks will be given by head of<br>department and that last year Department<br>before Julia and pathology was Allison<br>Rich who recently retired from the<br>University so Allison couldn't do it<br>um Warren Tate who was Julia's PhD<br>Mentor may have been able to give a<br>great summation in fact I know he would<br>have and I hope he's watching uh but he<br>wasn't available and so you drew the<br>Short Straw and you got me<br>um<br>but it is one of those serendipitous<br>moments that um that that leads to this<br>event and actually I'm struggling with<br>my Douglas Adams here but uh I'm I<br>recall in that book that Arthur Dent who<br>is the man at the center of the story<br>ends up uh<br>um on a spaceship uh where he meets a<br>girl called trillion who he had met at a<br>party in London and she'd been whisked<br>away by a two-headed alien who knew<br>um and when I came to the University of<br>otago 15 years ago I had a sort of a<br>trillion moment because there was Julia<br>and we had known each other for seemed<br>like for forever but we'd lost touch and<br>it was just delightful to be able to<br>reconnect and learn about the successes<br>that she had achieved at that time and<br>then obviously to work with her over the<br>last 15 years<br>so just to reflect what Julia has<br>delivered is a actually a really good<br>sip pot summary of Hitchhiker's Guide to<br>the Galaxy so there were quite a few<br>spoilers there to be fair you won't need<br>to read the trilogy which is in four<br>parts now but the<br>she's told us about the power of of<br>inquisit of being inquisitive of asking<br>questions of tucking away pieces of<br>knowledge that seem uh seemingly<br>irrelevant at the time and then<br>learning how those connections become<br>enlightened by new information as we go<br>forward<br>and I think that's incredibly powerful<br>um it's incredibly powerful and it's<br>something that we need to be mindful of<br>as we go through our scientific Journeys<br>because the piece of information that we<br>gain on a day-to-day basis May in fact<br>be the seeds of of quite brilliant<br>discoveries later<br>Julia has done as I expected she would<br>given us a tour de force on why<br>cohesions are the most important thing<br>and everyone should be studying them<br>but she's told us how this Central<br>molecule<br>controls such a sensual part of our<br>growth and development and how we go<br>from those single cells to the quite<br>unique beings we are one of the things I<br>find quite quite terrifying as a<br>geneticist and also somebody that does<br>studies reproductive biology is is how<br>many ways they can go fundamentally<br>wrong and it's quite terrifying<br>and yet and this is I think the<br>Exquisite Precision of it all most of<br>the time in many instances it goes<br>exquisitely right and how that happens<br>is actually one of life's great<br>Mysteries we haven't still quite<br>answered that yet but you know it's<br>still time Julia you know<br>um uh I<br>right yes so I think I've covered most<br>of the points I wanted to cover but just<br>to say thank you very much for sharing<br>um your your journey through science uh<br>your journey through Discovery<br>um for for plugging the need to<br>undertake basic research for plugging<br>the zebrafish facility for plugging the<br>need to stay internationally connected<br>uh so those subtle messages that you've<br>percolated through your talk I'm sure<br>will very carefully and thought and very<br>articulately delivered and we've taken<br>them on board so so thank you very much<br>for that<br>um<br>I will now segue to my second job which<br>is actually my normal formal role as<br>acting Deputy profiles Chancellor Health<br>Sciences which is to thank you all for<br>attending<br>um you know it's one these are wonderful<br>and special events<br>um and I think we've had a real treat<br>tonight so again thank you Julia and<br>thank you all for being part of this<br>very special day it doesn't end here<br>it's um we now have the opportunity uh<br>um to go across the staff club and have<br>a bit of Kai bit of a bit of a bit of<br>drink I don't know if the staff Club<br>manages to do pen collector gargle buses<br>but I'm willing to give it a try and if<br>I recall correctly that is like having<br>your brain smashed with a gold brick<br>with a small slice of lemon wrapped<br>around it or something like that anyway<br>on that note I just want to thank<br>everyone it's been a wonderful<br>opportunity to hear about Julia's<br>research and before I forget and I<br>almost did<br>I just want to give you Julia this small<br>gift and token of appreciation from the<br>University of otago for delivering such<br>a fine narration<br>passive</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
