welcome<br>everybody here tonight for the inaugural<br>lecture for Professor Stephen Marshall<br>um who is the director of the center for<br>academic development here at tahit<br>angawaka my name is Nick Smith and I'm<br>the vice Chancellor here and I'm really<br>excited to hear Steven's lecture for<br>probably three interrelated reasons the<br>first is that he's going to talk to us<br>about the future of the university and<br>where that sits in the changing<br>socio-political and increasingly<br>financial contexts and I think there's a<br>lot to learn in that process<br>the second is a sort of enlightened<br>self-interest and that in the university<br>community we have enormous expertise<br>across a whole range of different uh<br>Specialties but we don't always listen<br>to our own expertise around things that<br>are relevant to us<br>and just from an enlightened<br>self-interest perspective I'm really<br>interested to hear what Stephen has to<br>say<br>and the third which I've learned from<br>reading my notes<br>is that we're going to listen to<br>renaissance man we're going to listen to<br>somebody who has been at this University<br>uh for many years back to the mid 90s<br>when he received his PhD in Biochemistry<br>he then went and worked in information<br>technology and the university and then<br>has evolved into the center of the<br>academic development which is at that<br>Cutting Edge of where technology and<br>learning<br>I'm creating what is a unique experience<br>for our students I think it's it's an<br>experience which is probably more<br>important than it has ever been it's an<br>experience which is increasingly<br>relevant and it's an experience which<br>I'm very much looking forward to<br>learning about more in the next hour<br>congratulations Stevens we're delighted<br>to welcome you once again to the<br>professor to the university and I'm very<br>much looking forward to election<br>foreign<br>'s been here throughout my entire time<br>at this University keeping me in check<br>so thank you<br>it's lovely to be here and to take this<br>opportunity to talk about my research<br>with with friends with family with the<br>wider community of the university and<br>this is going to capture something of<br>the the life that I've had at this<br>University that Nick mentioned uh but<br>I'm primarily going to be thinking about<br>what that might help us understand for<br>the future of of universities in general<br>um but I do want to start with a sort of<br>caveat I spoke previously to Grant<br>Guilford uh a year or two ago and I<br>asked him when the professorial<br>infallibility thing kicked in and and<br>gave me that Perfection it turns out we<br>need to stop laughing at me uh that it<br>doesn't so uh I will I will however make<br>some mistakes I will tell you things<br>that are going to be wrong<br>uh<br>hopefully they're going to be thought<br>provoking and wrong in an interesting<br>way and one of the things I really want<br>to emphasize is that when we think about<br>the future when we engage in Futures<br>research the type that I'm going to talk<br>about today<br>we are not trying to predict the future<br>we're trying to understand the Dynamics<br>of things that affect us in order to<br>allow ourselves to learn and prepare<br>for a range of different Futures we<br>might experience so it's not about<br>setting up predictable 100 pathway it's<br>understanding the variety of pathways<br>I'm also just going to talk primarily<br>about things that have happened in the<br>past for me because I'm much more<br>confident that those actually did happen<br>so that's that's going to work for us I<br>do also have to make a couple of other<br>disclaimers<br>um first of all I'm not really going to<br>be talking specifically tonight about<br>the key decisions facing Victoria as an<br>institution and as an organization I'm<br>talking about universities in the in the<br>bigger sense<br>um I have colleagues who are much more<br>responsible for what actually happens in<br>this University and I'll provoke and<br>stimulate them and and you in our in our<br>audience<br>but I do want to be really clear I'm not<br>trying to Define Victoria's future in<br>this court talk at all<br>I'm also not going to talk about the<br>role of the University as a research<br>Institution<br>um that's an entire<br>separate conversation that has to happen<br>and there's an important part of that<br>it's another reason why you shouldn't<br>take what I'm saying today as a defining<br>framing thing for this particular<br>University that's complex and manifested<br>but it turns out that the learning and<br>teaching role that we play in the<br>positioning of ourselves in in society<br>in general<br>are still pretty important things to<br>consider<br>so<br>um more things that I'm not going to<br>talk about include some of the drivers<br>for the challenges facing the university<br>there's a talk there and we'll be able<br>to get that URL and go and watch the one<br>I gave last year I'm not doing that talk<br>again because it's a really depressing<br>talk this one's meant to be much happier<br>and positive and future looking I also<br>can't not put in an ad for my book where<br>500 000 words providing all the<br>background evidence for a number of the<br>statements I might make either in that<br>video or tonight<br>uh so I'm also not going to talk very<br>much about covert<br>believe it or not there's a couple of<br>things where it's going to pop into the<br>talk because it's a bit hard not to<br>but the things I'm talking about tonight<br>are much bigger than one single event as<br>as dramatic as that might be things I'm<br>talking about tonight are playing out<br>I'm also not going to talk very much<br>for a bunch of reasons<br>um<br>it's an important part of what's<br>happening for the University but again<br>not actually I think part of the<br>fundamental driver for where we're going<br>as an organization and what and as an<br>institutionalist Society it's a thing<br>it's a technology it's an important tool<br>but I think there are bigger and more<br>important things to talk about<br>so<br>here's the proposition I'm going to put<br>in front of you<br>proposition is that<br>what we are experiencing as universities<br>as societies<br>is a generational shift not nearly a<br>little bit like last year but a bit more<br>so I think we are at the cusp of some<br>fairly significant systemic changes<br>affecting higher education globally and<br>it's not just in New Zealand we're<br>seeing these things in many different<br>countries<br>also though when we talk about<br>universities in different ways so we<br>talk about the entrepreneurial<br>University there are other models of<br>universities as organizations talking<br>about them as ecologies and so on those<br>are about looking inwards at the<br>University<br>I want to look outwards I want to look<br>at what at the boundary between the<br>university and Society at large and I<br>want to think about the system of the<br>universities<br>in in large scale not simply inside one<br>Institution<br>and looking at that I want to ask what<br>does that look like as an institution of<br>our society<br>operating at a very large scale<br>universally experienced<br>but for our common good not for merely<br>economic good although the two are<br>related<br>and the phrasing I'm using here very<br>much is an institution as a social<br>institution which is to say something<br>which is fundamental to the operation of<br>our society<br>so we talk about having structures of<br>law of of the way that we relate to each<br>other uh Parliament Etc universities are<br>part of modern<br>well-functioning societies operating for<br>the good of the population and that's<br>the institution that I'm passionate<br>about protecting why I've been here for<br>so long not just about this one place<br>it's about the role that it plays and<br>the role that I think many of us share<br>in in valuing that and making that<br>happen<br>so I'm going to do a little bit of uh<br>talking about<br>uh<br>some of the models that underpin this<br>and then I'm going to kick into the main<br>part of it a critical one is something<br>that a sociologist called Martin tro<br>came up with in the 1970s when he looked<br>at the University Systems in the United<br>Kingdom and compared them to the United<br>States<br>and he noticed that a fundamental driver<br>changing the natures of those<br>universities was the scale in which they<br>operated in society<br>when they were institutions that only<br>met the needs of a small proportion of<br>the population the elite now that could<br>be intellectual social economic Elite<br>all sorts of different types<br>universities set somewhat disconnected<br>from society they are their own thing<br>they are important for the people who<br>are part of it but they're not<br>necessarily that important for people<br>who are not part of that environment<br>however when they grow to be get large<br>enough the nature of the University<br>shifts they become much more part of the<br>fabric and functioning of society and<br>Martin true observed the battle led to<br>changes in how they operate<br>because as something lifted at scale and<br>impact into society he observed that<br>things like the government's Behavior<br>around its regulation how it's funded<br>how the the drivers for what is valued<br>and seen as important shift<br>and then finally he observed that there<br>was hypothetically at that time an<br>opportunity to see another shift and he<br>predicted what might happen when it grew<br>to such a sufficient scale that the<br>University was a normalized experience<br>in everyone's life and that that might<br>see it shift again<br>so those three models that leak its<br>focus is primarily about legitimizing<br>someone it's actually some privilege<br>that is what is reinforced primarily in<br>that model<br>the mass model is about the creation of<br>qualification certification framework<br>economic utility and often and commonly<br>the creation and sustaining a<br>meritocracy<br>the problem with meritocracies is that<br>not everybody has the same experience<br>moving up the ladder of success<br>so meritocracies hypothetically seem<br>like a good thing as they grow but as<br>the scale of the meritocracy grows<br>people start to recognize the fact that<br>it also<br>uh leads to an ongoing sustaining of<br>inequality people don't start at the<br>same point on the ladder the steps that<br>they might move on that ladder are often<br>very differently separated<br>when we move on to the universal space<br>the focus shifts away from the systems<br>that have been established in the mass<br>model<br>and leads you to a model which is much<br>more about the individual personal<br>experience of Education of an<br>intellectual life<br>and its value to yourself but also then<br>to the common experience of that because<br>it's something that we all share and<br>experience<br>so potentially There's an opportunity to<br>move away from some of the drivers of<br>inequality but<br>there are no easy solutions<br>another way of thinking about that<br>framework is to think of it as a series<br>of layers and interfaces<br>so in the Elite model the interfaces<br>between an individual learner and their<br>University it's a very limited scale<br>interface<br>when we move into the mass model<br>the university operates within a system<br>and it starts to become part of the<br>fabric of society so there is an<br>intersection between<br>the individual University and the<br>institution of the university in that<br>Society the system of higher education<br>finally when we move into the universal<br>model<br>Focus shifts to consider the<br>relationship between that social<br>institution<br>and The Wider society and community<br>and within that the individual Learners<br>and communities within that and that's<br>where I'm going to spend most of my time<br>for the rest of this talk is thinking<br>about what it looks like when our<br>universities start moving into that<br>now<br>I'm going to refer to a bunch of<br>research at different points in this and<br>that text which is almost probably too<br>small for most of you comes from a piece<br>of work that I did so think about how to<br>ask questions of<br>a piece of work in a way that considers<br>uh<br>how we make sense of what's happening so<br>rather than trying to measure something<br>simply for a capability reasons the<br>framework that I have and cited there is<br>around asking questions that help you<br>challenge your understanding of that<br>thing and unpacking it I'm going to<br>focus primarily though on one of those<br>questions in relation to to the focus<br>for the night which is<br>what is it that we can do as a society<br>as a community as a university<br>as individuals to promote this concept<br>of achieving a common good<br>through a universal experience of higher<br>education rather than simply a mass<br>credential but<br>I'm going to do that by taking you<br>through sort of three general areas I'm<br>going to talk a little bit about change<br>which is always an entertaining<br>conversation in higher ed I'm going to<br>talk a little bit about technology<br>because I can't not talk about<br>technology and then I'm going to come<br>back and sort of summarize and look at<br>the common good<br>and what that might look like through in<br>Universal higher education<br>um I'm going to do that based on some<br>drawing some connections to experiences<br>that I've had here at this University so<br>you can see me in my first career as<br>biochemist uh looking at the DNA of a<br>bunch of different people in fact that's<br>the gene for alcohol dehydrogenase I'm<br>looking at right there<br>and I'm pointing at the genetic variant<br>that protects some people from becoming<br>alcoholics it's also the point at which<br>I started writing software because it's<br>very hard to check that you've actually<br>transcribed those sequences correctly<br>while checking a written version and<br>version there so I actually wrote some<br>software to read DNA sequences out to me<br>started my technology career<br>but I'll draw on some of these other<br>parts of my life experience<br>to unpack some of the rest of this<br>tonight<br>so these are some of my favorite words<br>as colleagues will well recognized<br>these are all synonyms for a much more<br>important word<br>when people talk to you about Innovation<br>when they talk to you about<br>transformational disruption they're<br>trying to talk about change and trying<br>to do it in a way to to frame that<br>conversation up I'm just going to talk<br>about change<br>because change is experienced in many a<br>Maria different ways and often it's the<br>very ordinary experience of change<br>that's far more important to us and far<br>more likely to have wider impact on<br>society than<br>massive transformational change<br>often a distraction now you can't really<br>talk about change in higher education<br>and universities without<br>referencing Clark and and his<br>observations on the university is a very<br>common quote<br>and people often point to images like<br>the one on the right there of a lecture<br>theater experience I particularly like<br>the student in the second row in the<br>foreground who've fallen asleep nobody's<br>done that yet here but it's fine<br>um<br>and and the reason I quite like this<br>quote is<br>because it's pretty much wrong<br>in many important ways<br>and and one of the things that this<br>quote really doesn't unpack and pay<br>attention to is that this the<br>universities we're experiencing today<br>are completely different to the ones of<br>a generation ago The Superficial parts<br>of them<br>the buildings and so forth old-fashioned<br>robes yes those things we carry with us<br>because it's always an and not an or<br>but this is a different University and<br>if you look back and there's a guy<br>called Geiger who has done this and and<br>unpacked 10 generations of the evolution<br>of the American University system as it<br>responds to the different environment<br>the different needs of society that it's<br>operating for and so<br>one of the things that we need to get<br>better at in universities is recognizing<br>and harnessing that generational change<br>and<br>unfortunately as much as we would like<br>to<br>to do that universities are not as good<br>as some organizations this is from a<br>very well regarded model of large<br>and the Insight that this image<br>represents is this idea that in any<br>environment there are things that you<br>must retain the core the identity the<br>values the things that define what it is<br>that makes the work of your organization<br>meaningful<br>however you also have to do things which<br>stimulate that to grow and to change and<br>to evolve<br>and it's very easy to mistake<br>physical affordances the major things<br>that are in your face is being the core<br>and to not recognize that there's<br>something Beyond those which is in fact<br>the real value of the University which I<br>and I'll come back and talk about what I<br>think that is about later on<br>problem we have in universities and that<br>I've experienced many times in my career<br>here universities just think we're about<br>protecting the core the university is<br>eternal and Timeless and our behaviors<br>need to move on from that and if we<br>don't<br>if we're not part of that<br>then we will suffer because it is going<br>to keep happening in this White House<br>and and part of the reason for that I<br>did say I wasn't going to talk about<br>um<br>covert particularly because covert is<br>actually only nearly the latest in a<br>long sequence of crises<br>we've now even got the word Perma crisis<br>to help us understand the fact that our<br>environment is not sufficiently stable<br>that we can remain in that preserved<br>status that we have had<br>so I did say I was going to draw on some<br>of the history of my work at the<br>University and and this fine fellow is<br>the New Zealand fear or the Blue Duck<br>resident of of many Alpine catchments in<br>New Zealand<br>but renowned for keeping trampers up at<br>night with with their whistling call<br>um<br>thing about Blue Duck is it turns out<br>they are very much home loving Birds<br>they're a bit like me I came to the<br>university I said I like it and I'm<br>staying that is the Blue Duck model of<br>life where they get raised by their<br>parents that's where they're going to<br>live<br>to the extent where we did DNA<br>fingerprinting on blue ducks and if you<br>were if that was a human DNA fingerprint<br>on the right there that would suggest<br>some serious issues in the family<br>because it's very highly inbred DNA<br>sequence you can see that all of the<br>bands in the individual columns uh<br>related basically the there are very<br>very few bands that are not shared by<br>different individuals and that's because<br>blue ducks are raised by their parents<br>they set up home immediately next door<br>and they breed and interbreed with very<br>close relatives and they have done so<br>for<br>thousands and thousands of years in the<br>perfectly healthy and perfectly happy<br>like that if you take them away from<br>their catchment they fly home because<br>that's where they live<br>so the bad news about this research<br>which I published with uh Sue traegerson<br>and my PhD supervisor Jeff Chambers<br>um you can't build dams on the rivers<br>and the Ducks will just move<br>so we were unpopular with the<br>electricity generators pointing out that<br>if they did build a dam<br>in in these large Alpine catchments then<br>they were going to wipe out a portion of<br>the genetic diversity of these bats so<br>that's an example of an animal that's<br>doing fine as loans nobody builds a dam<br>as long as the environment that's in<br>remains stable and static<br>unfortunately New Zealand ecologically<br>has demonstrated that stability is not<br>the thing that you can depend on<br>for universities or for ducks<br>sadly this is well given that I'm kindly<br>called reps with wings this is an<br>example of an animal that's doing much<br>better in the sort of disrupted and<br>Disturbed environments uh the<br>universities and animals are<br>experiencing these days<br>and and I Oscar Wilde called them rats<br>with wings<br>that's a bit unkind pigeons are actually<br>incredibly smart animals they're very<br>very good Flyers they're incredibly<br>adaptable to a different environment as<br>anyone who tries to keep them from<br>destroying the buildings by building<br>nests all the way through them in those<br>they're very very good at getting what<br>they want out of life so pigeon as much<br>as it's maligned or eaten in some places<br>um is a very successful animal because<br>of its ability to take what it can find<br>and make the best use of it and not over<br>commit itself to one particular way of<br>living its life<br>now the good news is<br>there are lots and lots of different<br>pigeons so I want the argument I'm<br>saying here is not that we have to<br>become very generically reactive to<br>whatever we find on the day that it is<br>possible for us to have our own identity<br>to be special and different in our own<br>way<br>and yet still be able to do that agile<br>thinking that that locking changes that<br>are any opportunities that are there for<br>us<br>of course there are new and interesting<br>ways that we can bring pigeons together<br>thank you open AI uh for my cyborg<br>pigeon image<br>so I now want to shift from talking<br>about change and and the reality that we<br>must change and be responsive to it<br>tell me a story<br>lots of devices yep I actually took mine<br>off and gave it to my wife it's the<br>first time in many years I've not<br>actually walking around with a phone in<br>yeah<br>absolutely<br>there's there are lots of ways this can<br>be interpreted I've heard someone<br>talking about the fact that you take<br>kids to wonderful museums and all they<br>do is talk on their damn phones<br>there's an equally valid narrative that<br>says you take them to the museum they<br>get really excited about what they're<br>seeing and they use their device to<br>share that and to learn more about it<br>and to to use that tool to lift the<br>experience that they're having<br>that's the argument that I want to make<br>in terms of how we think about the role<br>that technology plays in what we do it's<br>not something else it's part of the<br>experience<br>in fact we've captured this at this<br>University and this diagrams turned up<br>in our various strategies around<br>learning and teaching this idea that we<br>embed a whole range of different<br>Technologies into different contexts<br>within the experience so in a room like<br>this a formally scheduled event there's<br>a bunch of Technology present that's<br>helping us do what we're doing today<br>there's a network we could be using<br>interactive tools to engage with each<br>other I can get you to bring out your<br>cell phones and we can do some work with<br>go soapbox<br>uh and be interactive I'm not going to<br>do that for time reasons but we could<br>have<br>um as we move out of that space around<br>it there are a number of spaces we<br>provide on this campus for students to<br>keep learning with each other so a whole<br>bunch of shared rooms and spaces in<br>different parts of the University beyond<br>that we provide other spaces the mud eye<br>the library the student learning spaces<br>individual places to look after their<br>learning and then beyond that our spaces<br>turn into things which help us intersect<br>out to The Wider community and we start<br>having the boundary as we're doing<br>tonight between the intellectual life of<br>the university and our intersection with<br>the wider community<br>around us<br>however<br>let's talk about another view of some of<br>the spaces we have I use this<br>occasionally when I'm giving workshops<br>on how to make lectures interesting and<br>engaging comes from Michelle Foucault<br>it's a lithograph one of the reasons I<br>like it is the guy at the front is<br>lecturing people on the evils of<br>alcoholism alcohol is one of the areas<br>of my research originally but I'm<br>particularly struck by the guard on the<br>front there at the right who's just<br>really not having a good time<br>um I've actually been in one of these<br>there's one of them in Tasmania in the<br>prison there you can sit in it it's<br>called a silent prison facility the<br>prisoners were not allowed to talk to<br>each other they were only ever allowed<br>to talk to people who were good and<br>would give them the correct view of the<br>world they were not to be contaminated<br>by the views of the other prisoners<br>around them<br>and there's an argument that says that<br>sometimes electric and feel a bit like<br>the guy at the front is telling you this<br>is how the world has to be and how dare<br>you even think about talking to the<br>people around you because<br>the real truths up here professorial<br>infallibility for the one<br>but<br>there are other ways we can do things<br>and this is from some work uh some<br>colleagues here did uh I'm sure if<br>Amanda's hiding somewhere in the room<br>uh there she is fighting around the back<br>road Uh Kevin Gordon some other<br>colleagues so this is an example of what<br>happens when we allow our students to<br>talk to each other<br>anyone who's done microscopy teaching<br>knows the real problem with using a<br>microscope is that you look in the<br>microscope and you can see what you the<br>student thinks to see you then get the<br>student to look at it and they talk<br>about the air bubble on the top right<br>corner of the view because they don't<br>know what they're looking at and you<br>can't tell them where to look because<br>only one of you can use the microscope<br>at the same time<br>what they've done here is Hook the<br>microscope up to a big screen<br>now they're all looking at what the<br>microscope is showing at the same time<br>and everyone can talk about it and point<br>at it and start drawing on the image and<br>capturing what's going on there and the<br>microscope experience suddenly becomes a<br>Collaborative Learning Experience<br>interesting observation when they<br>started doing this in the labs that use<br>microscopes<br>they ran out of stuff to do in the lab<br>about two-thirds of the way through the<br>students were able to learn and do the<br>work of the lab so much more rapidly<br>but they didn't need the same amount of<br>time previously there's another layer<br>for this though<br>you slap Zoom onto this computer and<br>suddenly you can be doing this with a<br>classroom full of kids down on the South<br>Island at the same time<br>so that collaboration is not bounded<br>by the space of the University<br>when we start thinking about that we're<br>starting to think about the experience<br>of learning in quite a different way to<br>the one that was constrained by how many<br>microscopes we fit into the room how<br>many students could we look after in<br>that model<br>very very powerful<br>so that's one way to think about<br>technology<br>second way to think about technology<br>that came out of my I.T career is that I<br>started spending some time with people<br>trying to work out why every large<br>software project<br>by anybody<br>fails and basically large projects fail<br>it was interview on National radio this<br>week talking about the fact that the<br>success rate for very large projects is<br>less than one percent<br>for across doing what it's supposed to<br>do doing it in the time it's supposed to<br>do and doing it for the cost that we're<br>supposed to do they all failed<br>capability maturity model was invented<br>as a tool to help the people who engage<br>in large complex software projects<br>particularly<br>think about what they did in a way to<br>help them get better at doing that<br>and when I was looking at helping the<br>university try to change rather than<br>just preserve what it was doing and try<br>to enact new projects it struck me that<br>this might be a way of helping<br>people think about the capability of the<br>university to bring technology to Bear<br>to deploy the sorts of things like that<br>microscope example<br>and I created a thing called The<br>Learning maturity model which has been<br>very very successful as a piece of<br>research and what it suggests is is that<br>being successful at complex work being<br>successful changing required paying<br>attention to the doing of the thing how<br>you planned it how you thought about the<br>scale and scope and qualities of the<br>thing that you were trying to achieve<br>how you framed it<br>how you managed the things that took<br>place to make sure that you knew what<br>you were doing and did more of the good<br>stuff<br>and then optimizing it how did you think<br>about how to improve that such that over<br>time you just got better at what you<br>were doing it struck me that actually<br>you have to do all five of those you<br>can't it's not a sequence the original<br>capability maturity model<br>makes you go through a series of steps<br>I started thinking no actually let's<br>think about this holistically let's come<br>up from lots of directions<br>simultaneously<br>and<br>a ton of stuff published on this but the<br>one Insight that came out from a really<br>big study we did of all of the New<br>Zealand uh polytechnics<br>was that if we assessed their capability<br>to engage in the use of technology for<br>Learning and teaching<br>and if we organized<br>the resulting thing basically darker is<br>better than light is the simple way to<br>understand these blue dots you'll notice<br>that on the right hand side it's<br>generally a lot darker than on the left<br>hand side<br>that was not due to the amount of money<br>being spent by those institutions it was<br>not due to the size of the institution<br>in terms of the number of staff<br>it came down to how clearly they could<br>say what it is they were trying to<br>achieve<br>by engaging with technology and learning<br>and the investment in the people that<br>they made in order to implement that<br>strategy<br>so it was that investment in people to<br>transfer translate an idea a technology<br>a strategy an objective into reality<br>that really drove a list in the<br>capability of the organizations<br>and that that turned out to be a<br>reasonably<br>robust finding in a number of different<br>contexts<br>so<br>how to<br>enact that type of shift in the<br>University I'm going to take a step back<br>to my early days working in it at<br>Victoria on the left here we have one of<br>our first web pages for a course<br>Nate Talkington had finally talked to<br>the university colleagues Michael<br>Newberry is here for my ears days<br>into this newfangled web thing and we<br>thought we'd give it a crack<br>so the thing about that web page is I<br>wrote that by hand<br>each and individual each individual<br>course that had a website we had to hand<br>code the web page<br>we couldn't respect who had access to it<br>because restricting access to people who<br>were actually enrolled in the course was<br>too hard to do so you just you had a web<br>page and that was it make make the best<br>of it<br>of course these days we now have Nuku<br>which is the project of a number of my<br>team of prison today were have been part<br>of bringing to the university and<br>delivering<br>and the thing to appreciate about this<br>is that it's more than just making that<br>web page happen there is so much more<br>happening in this image on the right<br>compared to the image on the left that<br>respects our development and their<br>maturity as an organization our<br>understanding that it's not just about<br>delivering the web page that it's about<br>having<br>standards threshold standards for for<br>what it is that that represents does it<br>have<br>ways that we can manage and measure<br>what's happening in there that it's<br>standards driven so that we can continue<br>to build and expand on it and that it's<br>something that we can continue to<br>improve<br>so we went from something at Victoria<br>which was designed around this idea of<br>just managing access to web pages so as<br>I said before that manual web page<br>was quite hard to restrict the just the<br>people who should have access to it<br>that was Blackboard shortly after that<br>manually created page came to be and we<br>started having black wolf and and it did<br>us well for 20 years<br>and then we thought maybe we should do<br>better than that and that's what we've<br>been doing for the last couple of years<br>and we'll continue to do this year<br>with what we're calling a learning<br>platform<br>and and just the difference in<br>in what you're seeing there<br>represents a different way of thinking<br>about what we're trying to provide it's<br>not just a tool that managers and<br>curates a set of resources it's a tool<br>that provides experiences around<br>discussion inquiry practice production<br>acquisition and collaboration and that<br>there is a diverse<br>range of tools in that space and that we<br>can change and iterate those tools<br>independently of the core the core<br>enables that to take place but all those<br>other tools can be changed rapidly in<br>order to be responsive so we're keeping<br>the core we're preserving the things<br>that are important we're starting to<br>discover how we can make some of those<br>rapid changes to respond to the world so<br>that's where we are now now you'll<br>notice there's some space on the right<br>hand side so it's a surprise suppose<br>beyond that we're starting to think<br>about what it means to go beyond that<br>core platform and that looking inward to<br>the university view of the world and<br>start looking at what happens at the<br>boundary as we look outwards from the<br>University so there are a bunch of tools<br>that are starting to be used that are<br>not in that core platform but form an<br>opportunity to go out into the world and<br>to see things beyond that<br>and one of the ways to think about the<br>opportunity that represents is<br>um<br>is this image which I love which is this<br>idea that<br>things can happen out in that space<br>without<br>carrying all the encumbrances of the<br>older model and this is I find this just<br>an astonishingly powerful image when you<br>actually understand what has to be in<br>place for that Havelock to work well for<br>those children but also the<br>opportunities it represents and the fact<br>that it's<br>an unencumbered experience that<br>potentially can be available to<br>everybody including little kids on the<br>top water buffaloes<br>so<br>how do we<br>as universities<br>move into that space let's talk about<br>the universal models<br>I want to start by acknowledging some<br>work that I did with my colleague<br>Catherine who I saw hiding in the back<br>also and we've just published this in<br>the Oxford University press looking at<br>the New Zealand education system and<br>assessing it as it is currently<br>and if we keep our frame in the<br>operations of the mass model where it<br>would sit where you would say we are<br>situated by our size<br>there seem to be really only roughly<br>three choices facing New Zealand higher<br>ed<br>one is we just let the market model<br>operate New Zealand's very neoliberal<br>country we love Market forces operating<br>we just let that happen<br>what will happen is that eventually some<br>of the University will break<br>that the nature of the environment we're<br>in is that<br>unfortunately seems inevitable if we<br>maintain a purely profit Market oriented<br>so that's a problem<br>we could<br>do what the government is trying to do<br>with paper with the polytechnics and say<br>oh no we'll just turn you all into one<br>big coordinated<br>system uh operating as a structured<br>Network and and this was done in<br>California it has been highly successful<br>in California it is now being dismantled<br>because they can't afford to pay for it<br>so that's a problem that's a<br>generational problem with our experience<br>also frankly sitting on the bleachers<br>looking at Seafood finger yeah I'm not<br>in a hurry to see them apply that model<br>to the universities and I don't think<br>anyone else is now the complexity and<br>the challenge of actually trying to make<br>that happen for real<br>is really a problem<br>or somebody finds the Magic Money Tree<br>and we let ourselves just keep doing<br>what we want to do so none of these<br>choices are great choices<br>the good news is there is an opportunity<br>to think about ourselves<br>taking that Universal lens and to see<br>other opportunities ahead and to grow<br>into those and those allow us to<br>potentially manage some of the<br>Tangled complications of the previous<br>models but also to do what was given as<br>the vision of the university in New<br>Zealand more than a hundred years ago an<br>opportunity for it to be something that<br>is genuinely experienced<br>by everyone in New Zealand<br>and the thing to understand about that<br>too under a universal model is it's not<br>just the mass model delivered<br>to more people that is the mistake that<br>you can make in thinking about that that<br>leads you to things like moocs<br>we need to start when we think about<br>Universal models of higher education by<br>asking ourselves what is it that we are<br>trying to do for our society how is this<br>thing a good thing for all of us<br>so I used this image in the invitation<br>it's on the front slide it comes from<br>our covered close down period<br>it's a bit stacked those of us who love<br>and work in this campus that image can<br>be a bit sad actually looking at those<br>empty Halls<br>what we learned though from that<br>experience<br>is something that Peter Fleming and<br>Sydney expressed unfortunately badly<br>um<br>the importance of people<br>in giving the university it's it's<br>half in its impact so the university<br>isn't those empty Halls it's the life<br>that fills them and it's the success of<br>the university is a universal model is<br>when we translate that life out into<br>society at large and so it's how do we<br>make ourselves better at doing those<br>things that I would like to finish<br>talking about tonight<br>and I showed you this image before in<br>terms of how we're thinking about how we<br>situate the supports into learning and<br>teaching<br>we can flip the onion we can invert it<br>and go into it and start asking<br>ourselves if we<br>looked at the heart of this being how do<br>we enable learning to be embedded into<br>the community into individual lives and<br>if that's our primary starting point and<br>focus<br>the other things around the edges keep<br>happening this is not an either or<br>situation this is an and<br>but shifting your focus to look into it<br>that way changes how you challenge what<br>it is that we do and why we think about<br>it some of these ideas have been around<br>for a while I had to in fact they've<br>been around for so long that I had to<br>cross out the sexist language and<br>open it up to the entire Community<br>um<br>the thing about Mass education is it is<br>so wound up with management of<br>qualifications and accountability for<br>qualification<br>and we keep we knew do need them the<br>bachelor's degree is probably the most<br>important thing you can get in your life<br>if you have any aspiration to move<br>around the world because it is the thing<br>that lets you into most other countries<br>easily as a younger person it is a thing<br>that is widely recognized as being a<br>proxy for this is a good person to<br>consider having an engagement with<br>that understanding is no longer as well<br>accepted as it has been<br>and so I want you to draw your attention<br>to one particular part of this graph<br>which is the widening between the dark<br>green line which is the number of<br>domestic students in New Zealand<br>industry education<br>and the blue and the yellow lines which<br>are the population of people who in<br>theory should be attending<br>said education<br>there has been widening<br>for 20 years<br>this is not a covered phenomenon this is<br>a structural phenomenon of people<br>recognizing that the system is not<br>necessarily working for them in<br>delivering what they need in their life<br>this is and if I come back to the the<br>elite mass and Universal thing the<br>argument has always been that the<br>systems will grow and grow and grow it<br>and there are oecd charts showing every<br>country in the world with an upwards<br>trajectory of people getting educated<br>what those graphs are now showing in<br>some countries is that line leveling<br>often going backwards<br>and what is happening<br>I believe deposit<br>in New Zealand for example we have<br>roughly 35 of the adults have a<br>bachelor's degree<br>and stabilized with that it's been that<br>for about the last seven eight years<br>we're not educating more of the<br>population we're holding our ground and<br>going in a little bit backwards<br>we are being influenced by something<br>that I think the tro didn't appreciate<br>when he originally did his model by<br>looking at America and the UK and<br>comparing them as isolated systems<br>our world has become very connected and<br>globalized very interconnected so we are<br>starting to be influenced by the scale<br>of Education globally not just the scale<br>of Education within her own society and<br>that that is starting to influence<br>people's expectations and behaviors in<br>this contract and they're starting to<br>ask questions about is this delivering<br>for me what I need in my life or should<br>I be doing something else<br>there are lots of drivers for that cost<br>is a primary driver in many countries<br>but beyond cost is the sense that the<br>degree is no longer delivering given the<br>scale of its operation globally the same<br>value as it might have done in the past<br>and that's a challenge for us as we<br>start thinking about what might operate<br>to replace it in a universal scale<br>because one of the things that happens<br>is<br>I called Clayton Christensen talks about<br>this in this theories of innovation a<br>thing called Low End disruption<br>essentially once somebody works out a<br>way of delivering a universal experience<br>that's meaningful in multiple spaces and<br>contexts for different people not only<br>will that serve that greater population<br>of people it will push back down into<br>the space that's been traditionally<br>operated as the mass system<br>so that decline which is present on the<br>graph<br>as Alternatives become possible will<br>accelerate<br>that is a challenge to us if we're not<br>on the side of the graph doing the<br>accelerating and participating on that<br>so I've been doing some work with with<br>the European group looking at<br>what it is that people need and need to<br>experience in terms of skills and<br>knowledge to be successful in life and<br>throughout their life<br>um and it's it's Global future skills<br>project<br>and as part of that thinking uh I<br>started thinking about the difference<br>between the model that operates under<br>Mass education<br>where we separate the experience of<br>learning from the experience of its<br>application<br>so those two things operate in different<br>spaces and a Max model<br>it's like a production line you separate<br>out the tasks and you get more<br>efficiency that way<br>problem is production lines don't always<br>provide the level of individual<br>experience that we want to achieve on<br>the right hand side the universal model<br>suggests<br>so we need to integrate those things<br>together such that the experience of<br>learning is integrated into its<br>application directly<br>this is not work integrated learning<br>work integrated learning is a plugin to<br>a qualifications model under a mass<br>system<br>this is being in spaces of life and in<br>the community and experiencing the<br>opportunities to learn and be supportive<br>in doing that<br>it's a mind shift that we need to start<br>thinking about<br>interestingly and not not surprisingly<br>other's already there ahead of us this<br>comes from Harvard's Global strategy<br>document that was produced last year<br>uh and they talked about<br>the need to adopt a new strategy in<br>thinking about how they connected<br>learning and teaching<br>the importance that it build on what we<br>have because this is always an and<br>argument we will always have a lead<br>experiences<br>particularly the intellectually Elite<br>experiences will always have the mass<br>there is a very much a need for the<br>transition into life and and the<br>bachelor's degree in in pure utility<br>terms but beyond that there is so much<br>more and that's what Harvard has<br>recognized uh in what I think we all<br>need to start reflecting on considering<br>for the University<br>as we think about where our future lies<br>yeah<br>the system<br>I just want to leave you leave you with<br>a couple of thoughts<br>this one from Diane oblinger president<br>of electricals some years ago talking<br>about<br>how important it is to keep learning and<br>and this is the small point at which<br>I'll bring out the AI and the potential<br>that rapid technological change<br>provides to us which is the world is<br>going to continue to accelerate in the<br>scope and the extent of the change that<br>we experience<br>we are somewhere at an inflection point<br>probably at an early point we're not<br>going to suddenly have general purpose<br>AIS next year<br>but there are people who were not<br>betting on us having them anytime soon<br>who are now saying that yeah maybe five<br>years<br>not very far away at all and probably<br>sooner than anyone's comfortable<br>particularly based on our experiences so<br>far this year<br>second point<br>and value of the University we create<br>the future potentially that's the thing<br>about the people of this University and<br>its intellectual heart and its strengths<br>we have the opportunity to Define this<br>by creating it<br>and if we're participating in its<br>creation if we're engaged with it if<br>we're learning about it and<br>participating in it as actively as we<br>can<br>much more likely to understand it<br>entry I will help other people<br>understand that as well which is one of<br>the key roles in supporting the social<br>structure of this country and our role<br>as a social institution<br>thank you very much<br>I'm the Provost here at taharinga walk<br>up<br>um I'd like to acknowledge the vice<br>Chancellor Professor Nick Smith are<br>members of council it's lovely to see<br>you here as well uh star students dear<br>lovely to see you again Steven's wife<br>and his mother as well a great pleasure<br>to have you all with us this evening<br>it's a particular pleasure for me to<br>propose a vote of thanks for our<br>wonderful colleague aharangi Professor<br>Stephen Marshall who I am sure you agree<br>with me has just given an incredibly<br>thought-provoking uh inaugural lecture<br>what Stephen has done is cover some of<br>the issues and challenges currently<br>facing tertiary education reflecting on<br>how that will affect the future of the<br>University<br>not just this University not just New<br>Zealand universities but all<br>universities<br>and I'm sure it escaped nobody in the<br>audience the timeliness of what he has<br>shared with us this evening<br>I strongly agree with Stephen that our<br>universities are going through that once<br>in a generation shift<br>as Stephen himself said in his<br>presentation these different languages<br>for this the management Consultants talk<br>about disruption I'm quite fond of<br>transformation<br>uh that question about innovation<br>but whatever you call it is quite clear<br>that the accepted model for our sector<br>no longer holds<br>now as an economic geographer some of<br>you might not know that that is my<br>background uh crisis is always followed<br>by restructuring<br>for example my doctoral research was on<br>the Telecommunications industry<br>when it was going through a similar<br>period of call it what you like<br>disruption transformation innovation<br>now if you think about that industry 30<br>years ago<br>you begin to understand that sectors<br>sometimes are unrecognizable after both<br>crisis and restructuring<br>products change<br>organizations change and indeed some<br>disappear<br>labor forces change<br>and who we serve our customers also<br>change<br>now we're going through that period in<br>our universities<br>there's a question about whether degrees<br>will be the only or even the dominant<br>product for the future Stephen's been<br>very very clear about that<br>universities are also being challenged<br>by a whole raft of new organizations<br>both learning and teaching and research<br>our labor force our people are becoming<br>much more heterogeneous and our publics<br>and our students are making new demands<br>of us<br>so in all of the Stevens lecture is<br>incredibly Timely<br>our challenge is to think about a<br>university<br>not just of the future<br>but to reiterate Stephen's closing point<br>for the future<br>now Stephen has showed us something of<br>the questions that we will need to ask<br>of ourselves if we are going to get this<br>right<br>if we are going to do the Mind shift<br>that he has just asked us to do<br>and he has done it with consummate skill<br>knowledge and expertise<br>more generally I hope you can all<br>appreciate how incredibly privileged we<br>are to have Stephen with us here at<br>taharangawaka<br>he has led the center for academic<br>development incredibly effectively and<br>it's lovely to see all of his colleagues<br>who've turned out to support him this<br>evening<br>indeed in our recent academic audit it<br>was the center for academic development<br>that was singled out for the leadership<br>that they provided this University<br>uh into not just through the challenges<br>of recent years but into the world that<br>we are now moving into and you got just<br>a a snippet tonight of the extensive<br>National and international<br>experience and knowledge that Stephen<br>has brought to this role<br>I do want to take the opportunity to say<br>very personally Stephen how much I have<br>learned from you I have the incredible<br>privilege of having the center for<br>academic development in my portfolio<br>which is why I get to give the vote of<br>thanks tonight normally it would be a<br>Dean here Stephen you've done a terrific<br>job uh I have learned an incredible<br>amount from you and you are a colleague<br>Who I Really value and will genuinely<br>Miss so namah<br>but more generally at the moment of<br>celebration for all of us uh as you will<br>have gathered a particularly uh special<br>moment for me in having the opportunity<br>of offering that vote of thanks<br>now in a minute I'm going to invite you<br>all into the hunter common room next<br>door to share some refreshments but<br>first of all let's once again show our<br>gratitude and great celebration for<br>aharangi Professor Stephen Marshall well<br>done</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
