in case of emergencies<br>please use the exits provided and we are<br>sure that the house will will try and<br>to those that have passed we wish you<br>well in your onward Journey<br>um<br>welcome everyone<br>um my name is Richard Blakey I'm Deputy<br>Vice Chancellor for research and<br>Enterprise at the University of otago<br>and on behalf of the vice Chancellor and<br>our senior leadership group it's my<br>pleasure and privilege to be host for<br>you this evening for this inaugural<br>uh Jerry um Lynette Michael uh tinakley<br>to our distinguished professors who are<br>here with us welcome to those<br>distinguished professors of our<br>University other staff uh faculty<br>supporters and visitors both here and<br>online welcome welcome Thrice welcome<br>and particularly welcome to friends<br>whanau and supporters of Jerry I think<br>um from my official officiating at these<br>ceremonies it's a record in terms of the<br>number of people that have to be<br>acknowledged I think there are more that<br>will be acknowledged later but to your<br>wife Barbara uh kids Ben James I think<br>is online Sam who I think has a role<br>Somewhere In The Wider University Kiora<br>Sam<br>Marco Lucy wives Partners eight<br>grandchildren and many many more others<br>to you a very very special welcome as an<br>all group professorial lecture is a is a<br>an occasion of high importance for us as<br>a university but for the families of the<br>of the person being recognized it's also<br>very important I hope you're getting a<br>nice dinner somewhere afterwards as a<br>result of this<br>um the purpose of these lectures is<br>multi-fold principally it's to celebrate<br>achievement of academic promotion to our<br>highest category at the University of<br>otago their category of Professor it is<br>not a position that every academic will<br>achieve it is it is the Pinnacle<br>position and it does require outstanding<br>levels of achievement across all of the<br>areas of activity of a University<br>academic across teaching research and<br>service in order to Warrant that<br>promotion achievement of not only<br>sustained outstanding performance in<br>those areas but also leadership and I<br>think we see through the professorial<br>lectures not only a recognition through<br>the professor themselves professing to<br>you our audience the kinds of things<br>that they believe that they've done over<br>their career but that you will see shine<br>through this tonight I'm sure the<br>outstanding leadership that Jerry has<br>provided to us as a university<br>we measure and make our assessment of<br>promotion not just ourselves but we get<br>International<br>referees to give us quality assurance of<br>that and so it's based on our high<br>standards and the views of international<br>referees that this promotion has been<br>awarded my assessment I don't get<br>involved directly in this because it's a<br>very difficult process but my assessment<br>when looking at your resume Jerry is<br>that you have certainly<br>um<br>provided outstanding leadership my areas<br>research and you've demonstrated very<br>clearly that research is important to<br>incorporate within teaching and clinical<br>practice you've shown that research<br>saves lives quite directly and in the<br>long run research over many many years<br>by understanding issues developing<br>Solutions implementing those and<br>recognizing that our University motto<br>sap at ayode says that we need to dare<br>to be wise in many cases implementing<br>Solutions in willing patients for the<br>first time ever and I I'm really looking<br>forward to this to hear your story<br>because not only is this a recognition<br>of outstanding service and Leadership to<br>the university but for some of our us as<br>senior academics it's what we call<br>academic Spa time it actually allows us<br>to step out of our daily routine and Our<br>Daily Grind and facing the issues that<br>we have to look back and really reflect<br>on what we are as an institution a place<br>of learning where we have outstanding<br>students supported by outstanding<br>teachers who know their disciplines<br>profess it to the best of their ability<br>so the the order of proceedings is that<br>Lindley will um introduce your topic and<br>you in a little bit more detail you'll<br>give your lecture Michael will sum up<br>with a vote of thanks and then provided<br>everything goes well invite everyone to<br>the staff club for a Refreshments I'm<br>sorry those online uh you won't you'll<br>have to deal with your own Refreshments<br>but to keep things running I would now<br>simply want to invite Professor Langley<br>Anderson to introduce you to the to the<br>audience in more detail but in doing so<br>would offer the hardest congratulations<br>on behalf of the university for your<br>thank you<br>tinakoto katoa call Lindley Anderson<br>Toko and Noah my name's Lynn Lee<br>Anderson and I am the deputy dean of the<br>Dunedin school of medicine and I'm here<br>on behalf of the<br>um the dean Professor Joe Baxter<br>so I want to tell you a little bit more<br>about Jerry well Gerald Jared Wilkins is<br>a graduate of otago medical school who<br>returned to Dunedin from Boston in 1989<br>as a clinical academic and consultant<br>cardiologist in a joint clinical role at<br>Dunedin Hospital this means that he's<br>had a long and celebrated association<br>with the Dunedin School of Medicine<br>which we want to acknowledge today his<br>research interests as you will come to<br>know are wide including new medical<br>device research exercise physiology<br>studies with members of heart otago<br>research group rural Health outcomes<br>genetics selenium and experimental<br>models of cardiorenal physiology he has<br>participated in more than 50<br>multi-center International outcome<br>studies of new therapies that have<br>reshaped clinical Cardiology<br>he has pioneered many new Cardiology<br>procedures in New Zealand such as<br>coronary and carotid stenting and trans<br>radial and trans apical Interventional<br>approaches<br>he has an absolute passion for teaching<br>and he loves teaching he tells me and he<br>has this role as an academic teacher<br>he's received numerous awards from<br>medical students over the years and as<br>he has recognized internationally for<br>his academic and Technical contributions<br>to Interventional and structural heart<br>disease through academic meetings and<br>live case demonstrations<br>he has held numerous leadership<br>positions in Dunedin Hospital and<br>National organizations<br>now just before we get on to what Jerry<br>is going to be talking about today I<br>just want to acknowledge Dame Norma<br>restio who is in the audience today and<br>thank you very much for attending<br>um<br>uh Jerry I'm going to hand over very<br>soon to Professor Wilkins to talk about<br>his experiences of an academic clinician<br>in the development of cardiovascular<br>care throughout 40 Years of clinical<br>trials new device development and<br>fundamental science projects and as he<br>describes it it's been a blast so please<br>join with me in celebrating and<br>welcoming Professor Jared Wilkins thank<br>you<br>I said to someone on the way and a bit<br>of heating would be good it sounds like<br>it's going to be one of those nights<br>I am honored to be able to give a<br>lecture uh to the public and in the<br>public uh my friends my family some of<br>my grandchildren are on their best<br>behavior hi George<br>and to my son James Amy and<br>picture<br>there were lots of choices I decided to<br>go right down the middle and just talk<br>about history I thought that would be<br>more interesting than anything else<br>even naming this was kind of fun I I was<br>trying to find some way of conveying to<br>you that Cardiology has really changed<br>outcomes<br>phrase kept coming back into my mind<br>Giant Steps and then it kept saying<br>Giant Steps is what you take and then of<br>course walking on the moon then I<br>realized that I was actually humbling<br>along to this guy the police and sting<br>and I looked up when that was and that<br>was 1979. now<br>I suddenly realized I had to use this as<br>the title because<br>in 1979 A lot happened to a boy from a<br>small rural School in Southland<br>the most important thing that I did that<br>year was that I married bab and from<br>there on in all things became much<br>easier frankly and that's probably the<br>most important thing that happened in<br>1979 but actually in that year I had<br>just graduated in December and I was<br>doing my first house staff years<br>and I happened to do Cardiology with<br>Norma restio and cardiac surgery with<br>Pat Malloy back to back more or less in<br>that year<br>and I was hooked<br>and I'm the luckiest guy because I found<br>the job that I love to go to every day<br>even though there are bad days I still<br>love it<br>for the musicians in the audience and<br>there are a number of them here<br>a Giant Steps also is if you look it up<br>it's about John Coltrane and he<br>introduced some very dystonic kind of<br>jumps and Jazz which people thought oh<br>that's disgusting but they got used to<br>it and it's just part of Harmony now and<br>it seemed to me when I read that as well<br>that that's not a bad allegory for a lot<br>of medicine and it's a particularly good<br>allegory for the way Cardiology<br>developed over the last 40 years so<br>what's so giant about Cardiology I'm<br>going to go right back to the beginning<br>I'm showing you life expectancy graph<br>for a New Zealander over a number of<br>years along the bottom there are the<br>years and you can see that about when I<br>was born then<br>your mother died at 72 on average and<br>your father died at 67. now you could<br>say a lot of things about that it would<br>explain for instance why men retired at<br>65 they had about two years with their<br>slippers on and then they're likely to<br>be dead<br>now if you look over here the most<br>recent data in nearly 2020 men lived to<br>over 80 about 81 and women to about 83<br>or four<br>what happened along there to improve new<br>zealanders survival so much well we've<br>got to go and look at actual mortality<br>table so this is the opposite this is<br>death's falling and in that critical age<br>group we're just talking about 35 to 69<br>you can see there is an astronomical<br>fall<br>in death rates per hundred thousand for<br>men particularly and also for women to<br>the to the point that in that time I'm<br>talking about there's a 60 reduction in<br>death rate for this group now of course<br>if a lot more people live through the 69<br>that gets a lot of people through to 83<br>or four right<br>why<br>I'm now showing you the mortality drop<br>just for coronary disease in that death<br>in that group<br>it's astronomically bigger again it's 70<br>to 80 percent<br>and yes you know what I'm going to say<br>because I'm a cardiologist<br>here's the graph for everything and<br>here's that for cardiac death death from<br>a heart attack<br>you can see that the only thing that<br>comes close to explaining this fall is<br>the death from cardiovascular disease<br>all cancer deaths are coming down and as<br>I get older I want that to fall rapidly<br>if you put motor vehicle deaths you're<br>not really meant to put them on top of<br>each other academically but this is to<br>try and give you an idea you can see<br>that the biggest contributor to bigger<br>survival in New Zealand and it affect<br>the two big things are getting rid of<br>infinite mortality and child death with<br>vaccines and really the management of<br>cardiovascular disease is the biggest<br>player by far to date I hope that<br>everything else does the same<br>so if we now look at our Survival on<br>average for men and for women you can<br>see that in the year 2020 on average<br>half of us live to<br>82.06 years<br>and I've lived longer again right and<br>that that's a little worse than<br>Australia and we're doing better than<br>the us we're in effect survival is<br>falling and newer data shows that it's<br>fallen again now that's another whole<br>discussion while Western country is<br>falling<br>so the question that I'm going to try<br>and address quickly hopefully in an<br>intelligible way<br>is why did cardiovascular mortality fall<br>so much<br>and to understand that you've got to go<br>back to what was going on in about 1960<br>and 1970 when I graduated at the end of<br>that decade<br>well at that time heart attacks couldn't<br>be turned off<br>and so the emphasis is on recovery<br>if you were lucky enough to survive<br>there was a very high acute and<br>medium-term mortality from a heart<br>attack<br>the defibrillator had been invented and<br>if you want to see the Dunedin<br>Hospital's original defibrillator it's<br>in the waiting room up on the seventh<br>floor it's bigger than your frigid home<br>and you could only afford one so a<br>coronary care was built around the<br>defibrillator that's the origin of<br>coronary care units the defibrillator<br>costs so much<br>and they were effectively in the early<br>days morphine oxygen and lignocaine<br>two of those it's not even clear<br>actually work are beneficial anymore<br>right now if you want to see more of<br>this one of my mentors<br>was in this movie Ted Nai which goes<br>through his efforts to start rehab in<br>New Zealand and I've just will put in<br>one little snippet from this movie the<br>nurse is about to ask and when will he<br>go back to work or when will he leave<br>hospital will the patient be in hospital<br>well this naturally depends on his<br>progress and the presence or otherwise<br>of complications<br>in a straightforward case probably two<br>to four weeks<br>in any case it's not customary to allow<br>a patient back to work sooner than about<br>two months after his original attack<br>that was the Baseline and in fact Ted<br>was espousing a kind of radical idea<br>that people would leave hospital at<br>quickly<br>so I'm going to talk about a personal<br>View<br>I'm going to change my screen so I can<br>see it<br>of why those Giant Steps were made in<br>cardiology and I'm going to view it<br>through the lens of my own practice and<br>it's been a long and lucky career from<br>my point of view<br>because I just happen to be at the right<br>damn normal restio who I'm lucky to have<br>attending here was my mentor and taught<br>me Cardiology she suffered quite a bit<br>with me I think at times<br>but over three years she had been<br>performing outcomes research in the<br>coronary care unit of Dunedin Hospital<br>and I remember filling in paperwork<br>every Monday morning normal with you and<br>making sure that it was done<br>and over that period it reflects here<br>what was going on in mortality rates and<br>from that there's been a number of<br>Publications I've put three of them down<br>there but look just look at this data in<br>the 1979 to 81 period what we call the<br>biggest heart attacks are called SD<br>elevation in fact St the mortality rate<br>was 18 so if we turn that into what you<br>want to know that meant that 74 out of<br>403 people died in hospital from their<br>heart attack<br>and by 1989 to 91 that had dropped a bit<br>as the beginnings of new treatments came<br>along and then look<br>the newer ideas of stopping heart<br>attacks ameliorating damage estimating<br>and all the things I'm going to talk<br>about came along<br>mortality starts to drop like a stone<br>and indeed in contemporary work now<br>people joke that it's kind of hard to<br>die from a heart attack the mortality<br>rates are now three or four percent<br>across the board<br>indeed if you look at that from one of<br>these Publications if you look at who<br>was the biggest winners here is people<br>under 75 here are people over 75 the<br>biggest winners of all are the elderly<br>who have got the most to lose when they<br>have a heart attack they are much more<br>likely to die now you're going to say<br>that that's what nature does to you but<br>in fact that belief held back much of<br>what we do for many years<br>it was also the year that I engaged in<br>the first clinical Mega trial now Mega<br>trials are well known to people in<br>cardiology these are the times where<br>very large trials are conducted to get a<br>clear answer does this idea work this<br>drug this strategy or does it not<br>against a placebo and you get a clear<br>answer in the whatever the treatment is<br>gone or it's there in the middle of good<br>practice<br>this was called the Miami trial<br>metoprolola beta blocker drug in acute<br>myocardial infection pretty cute name<br>and basically what this demonstrated if<br>you look you either got given fake<br>metoprolol or metoprolol IV as you're<br>having a heart attack I remember doing<br>this it actually demonstrated that<br>across the board it didn't make any<br>difference at all but if you looked at<br>the high risk people with heart attacks<br>there was a difference a small survival<br>benefit and in fact all the trials of<br>beta blockers subsequently showed that<br>and that took nearly 6 000 patients<br>around the world to answer that and<br>that's what the mega trials are<br>University Hospitals doing combined<br>research<br>it also happened to be the time<br>we're coronary angioplasty started<br>here's a paper that I collected much of<br>the data for and then disappeared to<br>Boston and was published later by<br>Charles ellsley it was one of my mentors<br>look what he's saying<br>since May 1981 39 men and 11 women mean<br>age 55 have undergone balloon<br>angioplasty at Dunedin Hospital was<br>performed in 34 with stable angina 13<br>with unstable and already six percent of<br>them were having a heart attack that was<br>kind of a revolutionary even then<br>how did that happen this guy Mike ablett<br>lives in Australia I spoke to within the<br>last few months<br>did the first angioplasty in New Zealand<br>because someone had to as his reasoning<br>right and I think that was true there<br>was no skill base to do this but he had<br>attended a meeting on how to go about<br>doing this by the founder Andreas<br>groncig and Ben<br>and he came back and then the right case<br>started the technique<br>you can see that by our current<br>standards that wasn't overly successful<br>and everyone 70 single vessel 62 percent<br>Etc here<br>five ten percent underwent emergency<br>bypass grafting because it didn't work<br>out now how long is it for those of you<br>who work in cath labs and I can see lots<br>of my colleagues here how often does<br>but this was the beginning of a<br>revolution that's reflected in mortality<br>rates and ease of managing heart attacks<br>now and to explain this I'm going to<br>have to give you a little brief history<br>of Interventional Cardiology<br>so it starts right back here with a guy<br>called Werner forsman who in 1929 had<br>the outrageous courage<br>put a catheter in his heart and I'll get<br>to that in a minute I can see my brother<br>Peter who doesn't like the stuff scrap<br>slightly going over God in 1958 a guy<br>called Mason sewn squirted die and the<br>big blood vessel above the heart and the<br>catheter jumped into a coronary artery<br>but everyone oh my God he'll kill the<br>patient but in fact it didn't and he<br>therefore went on had the courage to go<br>ahead and take pictures of cardi<br>arteries<br>and then the shapes of catheters got so<br>easy that you could teach monkeys to do<br>a coronation gram or someone once said<br>to me and then gronzig invented the<br>first balloon Mike ablett was doing it<br>soon after it was invented in 1981 and I<br>was standing in the back room watching<br>him do it because I was training as a<br>registrar<br>soon after that in Kansas these two guys<br>started doing treating heart attacks by<br>opening arteries with balloons and one<br>of those guys is from otago University<br>from Southland Barry Rutherford who's<br>still alive in Kansas and is much fated<br>as one of the founders of this whole<br>deal<br>he's from otago University in other<br>words<br>segvat put the first Stanton I started<br>standing in New Zealand in 1989 and yeah<br>around it's moved about about 1990 and<br>then stents came into common use and<br>trials of what to do strategies<br>overwhelmingly supported doing<br>'s story I said he put a catheter in a<br>hat he put it in his own hat<br>he was told not to do this<br>so one night with the help of a nurse he<br>cut down on his own brachial vein and<br>threat there was no catheters for hats<br>he got a urinary catheter and he<br>measured the distance and he pushed it<br>up to his heart<br>and then he walked down to the x-ray<br>department and he had this Photograph<br>this x-ray taken look here it is here's<br>the catheter coming up as vain going<br>around and if you follow it there it is<br>sitting in his right atrium<br>he got fired basically for doing this by<br>the boss he did actually have a career<br>as a urologist he had a bit of a<br>checkered career including joining the<br>Nazi party and a few other things but in<br>fact was given a Nobel Prize very much<br>later in his life because of this<br>breakthrough which allows us to do so<br>many things<br>this is the first balloon invented by<br>Andreas gronzig by which he did an<br>angioplasty you couldn't go and buy one<br>because no one had ever done it it's a<br>gigantic Thing by the standards of what<br>we do today<br>nowadays stents look like that and<br>they're tiny little things there's one<br>wrapped around a pencil to give you the<br>idea of how tiny these things are on the<br>way in<br>and just to summarize what we do now<br>this is a heart attack someone I looked<br>after within the last few weeks<br>I chose one where it was kind of easy to<br>see so this patient has come in maybe<br>off a helicopter from Wanaka or<br>somewhere with chest pain they've got<br>morphine on board they come straight off<br>the helipad into the catheter lab<br>nursing staff are looking after them<br>scrub up enter through the wrist<br>and you can see there's an artery that<br>stops right there it doesn't go anywhere<br>the artery to the back of the heart<br>looks healthy now I've got a super fine<br>little wire resting against that<br>blockage Point see there you shake this<br>little here like wire next thing you<br>through the artery and you've unblocked<br>it<br>and this happens to have a really neat<br>thing you can see what the heart attacks<br>caused by so here it was blocked here is<br>all cholesterol goo and here's the<br>little crater that caused the clotting<br>so in other words you have to imagine<br>that the real arteries that shape and<br>that little thing there cracked and the<br>clot formed because of that inside the<br>artery that's the mechanism We Now<br>understand that caused all of those<br>deaths in people<br>now obviously this is pretty easy to fix<br>now you put a balloon in there you blow<br>it up you make a bigger hole you put a<br>stent in and measure it up<br>and then you blow the stent up and bingo<br>being the whole Outer is fixed okay<br>patient immediately feels better Sudden<br>talks talks talks with a fuller Morphine<br>by this stage and their background to<br>the wood and whoever's doing it and<br>there are five or so of us in this area<br>you go back to bed if it's in the middle<br>of the night<br>you feel good about it because you help<br>somebody and the team that does this<br>stuff is remarkable the nursing staff<br>the skilled technicians the<br>radiographers<br>we go in through that little thing in<br>the wrist<br>and then we take them around to the<br>water and we see how big the heart<br>attack is this is an ultrasound scan<br>this too it was unheard of in the 1970s<br>it looks at the size of the heart attack<br>and you can see this but it's all<br>Contracting in this but it's not because<br>that's where that artery goes<br>so getting an idea of what's happening<br>in the heart allows us to choose the<br>right medications which also come from<br>trials so the patient leaves Hospital<br>two to three days later actually you'd<br>be pretty lucky in Dunedin Hospital to<br>get three days rest now right remember<br>Ted nine three weeks and that was a<br>radical shortening and that's a very<br>short time ago<br>they leave on these drugs aspirin<br>tykagalure each of those has been<br>subjected to a massive Mega trial two or<br>three of them so we know that they add<br>life saved<br>now of course rehab's been tested<br>smoking cessations not been checked in a<br>re in a randomized trial<br>that would be hard to use smoke you<br>don't and just keep doing it for 20<br>years and see what happens but there's<br>so much data that it's overwhelming and<br>we only see people with big heart<br>attacks probably only once this is a<br>striking difference it's a giant step<br>if we think which of the things that I'm<br>talking about have made the difference<br>all of them this is for people who are<br>used to looking at relative risks this<br>is a nice way of of presenting this data<br>from Derek Chu who took 42 000 people in<br>a big database called Monica and was<br>able to look at relative impact of each<br>of the treatments because within that<br>database not everybody got all five<br>things done and you're able to do a very<br>clever statistical waiting where you<br>look at what adds what<br>so it turns out the biggest benefit a<br>reduction down to 0.58 risk is by<br>revascularizing re-plumbing people if<br>they come in with a heart attack and<br>then the next most important thing is<br>just to take a cholesterol-lowering drug<br>called a Statin and then it's<br>anti-plated agents rehab beta blockers<br>so why did that graph get so much better<br>it's hard to say which of all of these<br>things is the most important but<br>modeling shows that this remarkable<br>decline is fueled by rapid progress and<br>prevention and treatment including<br>precipitous declines in smoking<br>improvements in hypertension treatment<br>and control widespread use of statin<br>drugs to lower circulating cholesterol<br>and the development of time and timely<br>use of clot busting drugs called<br>thrombolytics and stents an acute<br>coronary syndromes to prevent a further<br>heart attack<br>and the evidence for that statement<br>comes from large Cooperative Mega trials<br>and Cardiology is really lucky it's led<br>the way in this area and other<br>disciplines of course are doing the same<br>thing to get an understanding of<br>treatment strategies they require<br>multiple sites cooperating to get a<br>clear answer<br>and as already thank you for the kind<br>introduction I've actually done a lot of<br>those Mega trials over the years with a<br>group of dedicated research nurses who<br>have been absolutely outstanding at<br>quietly putting patients into trials so<br>that we can understand<br>at points where we don't understand the<br>right thing to do<br>what's the right thing to do<br>and these trials these are kind of drug<br>and strategy trials but also a number of<br>First and man trials why do we do them<br>well we choose that to enter the trials<br>that have an important clinical practice<br>point to answer where there's a gap in<br>the understanding of knowledge in the<br>area where the protocol is reasonable<br>for the participants<br>where we can expect to find people who<br>would join such a trial where we have<br>the resources to do it<br>and obviously where we can get some<br>benefit from that to support other<br>endeavors and research I'm just going to<br>go through a couple of these really<br>quickly notice that for the academics<br>that these things have gigantic impact<br>factors I'm going to only show you the a<br>few from the New England Journal which<br>is the highest ranked medical journal in<br>fact one of the highest ranked research<br>channels in the world<br>he is for instance is the idea of a drip<br>of one of the clot busting drugs versus<br>being able to give it as a bullish which<br>clearly makes it feasible if you can<br>just give it like that to do it in an<br>ambulance rather than in a hospital<br>showing that it made no difference to<br>give it as a boss that's a big<br>breakthrough to know that or for<br>instance these are drugs a group of<br>drugs called this one's the Miller fiban<br>which was a type of anti-platelet agent<br>which was very expensive and it was<br>challenging cheaper things like aspirin<br>Ty clopidine that we use after coronary<br>syndromes and stents turned out it was<br>no better this drug and two or three<br>others that we did trials for then the<br>cheap stuff<br>that would have made a big dent on<br>medical spending if we'd believe the<br>data without doing the mega trial<br>here's a really important one a weak<br>Statin called pravastatin was a subject<br>of a very large trial of about ten<br>thousand nine thousand patients only in<br>Australia and New Zealand<br>and in this trial we tended to put<br>people who had had heart attacks not all<br>of them<br>it was weak but over the years that we<br>followed them six or seven with<br>excellent follow-up you could see that<br>not having a Statin versus being on a<br>Statin saved a lot of lives<br>so that this trial and two or three<br>others similar are just part of what we<br>expect from standard care they're at<br>every practice guideline to every group<br>that are involved in managing people<br>with heart attack and with stroke<br>these trials really change what happens<br>we've been continuing to do this this is<br>one of the drugs that replaces an old<br>drug called Warfarin which is dirt cheap<br>but patients never want to go on it<br>because they have to have blood tests to<br>get the settings right almost every week<br>for the rest of their lives<br>so this trial a very large trial 14 000<br>patients demonstrated that River Rocks<br>are bound which you just took and never<br>had to have a blood test reduces the<br>risk of stroke to the same level that<br>Warfarin does and you never have to have<br>a blood test<br>that's a big breakthrough<br>here's a new cholesterol-lowering drug<br>an injectable monoclonal antibody to get<br>rid of something called pcsk9 which<br>would be great to talk about but we'll<br>move the placebo here is a big dose of<br>Statin already okay so you're already on<br>a Statin and this is what your<br>cholesterol is and then you also have<br>this two weekly or four weekly injection<br>under your skin and it lowers the<br>cholesterol dramatically down to numbers<br>like 1.5<br>now we used to think until we had a drug<br>that would get you down that far that<br>you really didn't need to go that low<br>well mostly because you couldn't get<br>people down there but when you can you<br>can demonstrate that there is a survival<br>Advantage if you are post heart attack<br>or you've had a heart attack<br>so watch the space these drugs are very<br>expensive but equivalence of these will<br>turn up soon<br>even things that we eat so omega-3<br>products are much talked about they have<br>sold a lot in pharmacies but actually<br>there's no trial demonstrating any<br>survival benefit from being omega-3s<br>here is a one of those products this one<br>called icosapent ethyl it's a highly<br>specific omega-3 which completed this<br>trial with a survival benefit a<br>reduction in heart attack endpoint<br>so that we can say that at least one<br>specific omega-3 type<br>product<br>can deliver a survival Advantage<br>although many of the others that have<br>been tested similarly have not so it's<br>probably the type of Omega-3 and not all<br>of them<br>I've got I think 199 Publications from<br>such trials and yes they've been going<br>on in lots of centers to me these are<br>really important because they literally<br>change outcomes across the world<br>they form guidelines and that's where<br>that data that I just quoted in a recent<br>article about declining survival comes<br>from<br>let's go back to angioplasty because<br>this is one of my great loves<br>so this whole Space went from being Nano<br>the cardiac surgeons fix hats to I know<br>the cardiologists fix Hearts I don't<br>know whether dicks in the audience he'll<br>get me later<br>dick Bunton but in fact we've been<br>poking our noses into all sorts of<br>and partly that's because I have this<br>innate need to buy every Gadget I'm the<br>guy who goes on a rainy day to uh the uh<br>you know to to the hardware store and<br>walks around saying oh my God I need one<br>I've done a lot of device trials some of<br>them are first in men's and that means<br>that we've done something in live human<br>beings that's never been done before<br>and that's a particularly special kind<br>of trial to do and you don't do that<br>without a lot of thought<br>it's often about whole new ideas and<br>some of these seem quite crazy<br>taking out this for instance in hepatic<br>arteries taking out the sympathetic<br>nerves with a radio frequency ablation<br>in an effort to lower blood sugar<br>but clear it works it sort of goes in<br>the right direction<br>why is this important I think medicine<br>requires Innovation to improve<br>and Innovation at times requires<br>calculated risk<br>but I say calculated and I think it<br>needs to be done within the file the<br>confines of Trials where every single<br>thing that can be anticipated is looked<br>after<br>and then you do a trial of Safety First<br>and it's only after you've proven safety<br>that you go on to do does the device<br>deliver right it's always about safety<br>first I won't get into a long talk about<br>trial trials and the implications of<br>bioethics but in fact I've been<br>obviously walking along the edges of<br>that much of my career<br>somebody had to do things first and that<br>included the first coronary implant of a<br>stent by myself<br>and another thing I'm very proud of that<br>somehow I managed to introduce radial<br>intervention the thing I was showing you<br>rotor Bladers and a whole lot of other<br>things that we won't stand around and<br>look at<br>it turns out that rather than think of<br>ourselves as isolated from the world in<br>Dunedin you know the far Corner possibly<br>the most southerly cath lab in the world<br>right I haven't found anyone that can<br>claim one in Argentina uh that's any<br>that we have been relatively Heavy<br>Hitters in the world of first and man<br>research<br>why did that happen<br>well it actually exploits the opposite<br>of what you think a natural advantage<br>that we have here<br>we have high levels of local expertise<br>which can't be matched easily at other<br>places<br>we have low cost structures to do trials<br>we have a really excellent ACC system<br>that really helps to do trials<br>we have organized Central ethics which<br>mean that one ethics board covers the<br>new whole of New Zealand so things are<br>standardized we have excellent<br>compliance patients are amazingly<br>helpful in research in our area<br>they always turn up for their follow-up<br>almost with no exceptions and we have a<br>strong track record of doing the last<br>one well so we get to do the next one<br>and that resulted in a small group about<br>five hospitals two in Melbourne one in<br>Sydney Auckland and Dunedin pioneering<br>so many<br>stents right<br>now why drug alluding stints well when<br>we first started putting stents in the<br>the result on the angiogram this nice<br>open artery held up by that little mesh<br>of stainless steel was so phenomenally<br>attractive that you just wanted to put<br>them in everyone but it turned out those<br>early stents called bare metal stents<br>sometimes provoked a kind of scarring<br>reaction so the same thing if you put a<br>splinter in your finger you'll sometimes<br>have a very heaped up so-called proud<br>flesh right<br>which would narrow the stent right back<br>down to where you started by about three<br>to six months<br>a lot of thought was put into why that<br>was happening and probably changes<br>thinner straps on the stents has helped<br>but one of the ways of doing this is to<br>build onto the stent<br>a tiny microscopic layer like a wet X<br>cloth that can hold on to a tiny<br>quantity of an anti-proliferative or an<br>anti-rejection drug<br>when you put the Stenton it therefore<br>comes out very slowly into the wall of<br>the artery over the next 40 days<br>and that turns off that response and<br>pretty much now all stents heal with no<br>scar tissue in them at all<br>it took a lot of work on what drug what<br>dose what type of polymer to get that<br>right and first and man trials had to be<br>done<br>I'm going to run through some of them<br>that were done here at the center<br>and in fact what it results in<br>effectively at that time and about the<br>late 90s into the early 2000s there was<br>probably about six or seven stents used<br>around the world three of them had been<br>first in man trialed in those five<br>hospitals in Dunedin and two of the<br>others had been subjects of great big<br>database follow-ups<br>so we have a proud tradition of doing it<br>first and in a way leading and I hope we<br>can keep that up<br>now does that mean that everything went<br>well this is one trial where it clearly<br>didn't one of those drugs that looked<br>like it could be promising is a really<br>cheap drug called actinomycin the drug<br>that one in the end was called rapamycin<br>and kind of was thought to be a bit<br>similar its new name is serolimus it<br>wasn't similar you can see the people<br>who are randomized to Bare Metal stent<br>here had better long-lasting freedom<br>from scar than actinomycin and in fact<br>we had to come up with alternative<br>management strategies in the small group<br>of people in this trial<br>so in other words without trials we<br>would not know what to have on the stent<br>to get the end result<br>I guess one of the things that has<br>changed outcomes for people in a<br>practical sense is just the introduction<br>of doing your heart operation through<br>your wrist rather than a bigger catheter<br>through the big artery in the leg<br>now in some people that arteries a long<br>way away from the surface in others it's<br>not and that means there's lots of<br>bleeding and when you filled people with<br>clot busting drugs it's kind of hard to<br>do a catheter study in some folk<br>I happen to be filling in about a half<br>an hour between the lectures that I<br>wanted to go to at a European Society of<br>Cardiology meeting in about<br>1982 at 92<br>and I wondered and saw a poster on a<br>wall<br>and the owner of the poster standing<br>beside it and it turned out to be<br>Ferdinand kimene who I've known ever<br>since and he had invented for the first<br>time<br>doing it from the heart and doing stents<br>uh it had been done as an angiogram<br>prior to that the year before in France<br>it seemed such a good idea that I bought<br>that home and I I know that I really<br>annoyed the nursing staff in the cath<br>lab for years trying to get this right<br>but in fact it became the standard and<br>by 2012 myself and colleagues uh Coogan<br>got the data to get our trainee at the<br>time on how a whole Hospital group<br>had changed from doing mostly femoral to<br>mostly radial and that complication<br>rates had just dropped away to nothing<br>and by this I just mean that you felt<br>the artery in the wrist you put a little<br>needle in you pop that tube in right and<br>you pulled this thing out and you just<br>pushed a clamp on it I know I'm making<br>some people feel sick but you need to<br>know what this is It's just so<br>ridiculously simple but it actually is<br>associated with better survival right<br>more people live if they have it done<br>that way than the bleeding risk from the<br>leg when you do a lot of people who are<br>in emergencies<br>and the the a very flattering editorial<br>came when this paper was published and I<br>still smile at this the editor wrote<br>because he was writing to an American<br>audience who were really against making<br>change<br>look it happened quickly in Dunedin it<br>happened in a year regardless of the<br>level of Prior experience even the<br>fellows could do it the trainee centers<br>with immediate reduction in bleeding<br>complications to the Delight of everyone<br>patients and staff so why aren't you<br>doing it and I've often used that in<br>lectures and treating and teaching about<br>radial intervention after that<br>I'm now going to sort of speed through<br>some of the other fun stuff in my life<br>in the end this is about being able to<br>see into the Hat because if you can't<br>see you couldn't do any of this stuff in<br>the 1970s there was rudimentary<br>screening in x-ray rooms there was M<br>mode Echo and there was ECGs and now<br>we've got the suite of tools<br>those who do this will know what they<br>are I'll show you what they look like<br>and I it was suggested to be my Norm by<br>Norma restio that I should go off and<br>learn about Imaging and that was the<br>best thing you ever told me Norma<br>because<br>that meant that I was assisted into<br>getting a overseas Fellowship by the<br>national heart foundation and I was<br>parachuted into one of the most<br>outstanding Cardiology units in the<br>world it's Mass General Hospital in<br>Boston<br>that's me standing right there okay<br>and like and came and who came with me<br>my wife Barbara and this little<br>red-headed guy here came<br>and he was quite difficult in airports<br>uh and he ended up growing up to be a<br>cardiologist as well and he ended up<br>having a national Heart Foundation<br>Fellowship as well and I think that's<br>kind of a neat story<br>I'm just going to point out some of the<br>things that I was involved with there<br>and maybe the impact that they made now<br>this is kind of a a kind of a confusing<br>looking graph but one of the papers that<br>I'm very proud of in retrospect is one<br>of the only trials that that's really<br>looked at whether an echo cardigram I've<br>shown you one<br>can size a heart attack because it was<br>unclear<br>in 1984 whether you could do that<br>so I managed to convince Jim Southern<br>who was so broad of accent from<br>um somewhere in Deep South that I could<br>travel to understanding them sometimes<br>to find the people that I'd identified<br>in Mass General who had had an<br>echocardiogram within a day or so of<br>dying of their heart attack<br>and asked him to size the size of the<br>heart attack from autopsy material by<br>doing this looking at the in fact size<br>measuring over the top and quantifying<br>it we do this in experimental models uh<br>when we're when we're looking at heart<br>attack sizing<br>and then from these simple views of an<br>echocadagram those the<br>echocardiographers here will recognize<br>this we were abled and we were working<br>on this produce a very interesting<br>actual surface rendering of where the in<br>fact was<br>but this technique<br>and here for instance is the biggest<br>heart attack out of that group and you<br>can see that the only bit left working<br>is the circumflex territory there<br>now this demonstrated that if you took<br>autopsy surface area and you took the<br>echo the functional heart attack size<br>that there was an amazing correlation<br>and that is what we do every day around<br>the world to size up a heart attack now<br>we just do an echocadogram<br>I read the first two sentences of my<br>paper the other day and thought I wasn't<br>too far out was I with increasing<br>interest in myocardial Salvage after<br>presumed acute coronary occlusion an<br>accurate repeatable measure of the<br>amount of left ventricle rendered<br>dysfunctional by the ischemic processes<br>needed ideally such a method should be<br>quantifiably accurate non-invasive and<br>easily reproducible so that comparisons<br>through time and through subjects can be<br>made and coined the term a functional in<br>fact size<br>well that's just fundamental stuff now<br>and I think many of you who are training<br>probably forget that actually we didn't<br>even know that back then that data and<br>and that technique I wish that it was<br>available on Echo machines<br>um it it uh it's Well published and when<br>validated<br>in fact as I left Boston I had already<br>employed a fellow like Picard who became<br>the head of the echo lab eventually at<br>Mass General and a research<br>echocardiographer and had done two lots<br>of work I'd started a trial watching<br>heart attack patients to see what<br>happened and I also did a whole series<br>of dog experiments to see how quickly<br>these changes came on<br>thanks to Mike they all got published<br>after I scap it and came back to Dunedin<br>I'm going to move on<br>what did this work have as its impact<br>well a better understanding of the<br>progressive changes that happen in heart<br>attacks over time<br>Trials of reperfusion and stents made<br>sense if you could see the heart attack<br>say shrinking or not expanding over time<br>and Drug trials such as ice Inhibitors<br>and all the things that we give to stop<br>the heart stretching after a heart<br>attack have changed the Outlook and kept<br>people alive<br>here's another really fun paper that I<br>published at that time which goes back<br>to the very core of Cardiology Imaging<br>an outstanding clinician scientists live<br>Hatley had published a book we where she<br>explored the theoretical things that you<br>could do with sound going through the<br>narrowing of heart valves and you could<br>calculate from the Doppler equation and<br>from fluid dynamics the Bernoulli<br>equation you could calculate pressure<br>drops very accurately in Native Valves<br>and work was done but what was not known<br>did these assumptions apply to the very<br>strange shapes that come with some<br>prosthetic heart valves where there's<br>balls and cages and disks that tilt<br>so I was able to well befriend people in<br>the Cath Lab at Mass General and they<br>became very firm friends after that<br>and convince them that I needed to do<br>simultaneously echocardiograms<br>while they had catheters on either side<br>of dysfunctional valves<br>and that data showed an amazing<br>correlation<br>it was only at that time in 13 different<br>prostheses note for the cath lab ladies<br>that many of those cases were done by<br>direct punctures of things like<br>transceptors right ventricular you can<br>see where it came from okay you right<br>and this basically the impact of that<br>paper was the first paper that had ever<br>shown this assumption to be true<br>that basically since it was true no one<br>needed to have a cardiac catheterization<br>of that sort to prove that a valve was<br>working or not working from there on in<br>and that basically means that that tool<br>and the subsequent papers that validated<br>my work are part of standard cardiology<br>practice now<br>I suppose the thing that had the biggest<br>impact upon my career is this paper<br>in July 1988<br>and a number of papers that followed<br>were a very simple idea turned out to<br>have a big effect<br>so the impact of what I'm now going to<br>explain to you was a simple system to<br>pick which patients would have a good<br>result from a new procedure<br>suddenly in favorable cases a balloon<br>procedure and a conscious patient<br>replaced heart surgery<br>and this had a really big impact in<br>low-income countries with high rates of<br>rheumatic heart disease<br>because they didn't even have cardiac<br>surgical programs but some of them had<br>cath labs<br>and actually as a result of this<br>development a whole new branch of<br>Cardiology turned up I've told you about<br>Interventional Cardiology that stenting<br>well this is another one called<br>structural heart disease<br>what was this in rheumatic heart disease<br>we worked out how to put a balloon in a<br>here's a patient with typical mitral<br>stenosis and those of you that look at<br>Echoes will see that the valve is stuck<br>at its edges here and it's beautifully<br>flexible but it's stopping blood getting<br>in from the left atrium which is<br>enlarged into the left ventricle<br>and this little hole should be open the<br>leaflet should open all the way out here<br>but there's just a small hole probably<br>less than a square centimeter when<br>really that valve should open about<br>and you can see here's that the valve<br>again and this is transesophageal Echo<br>you can even see the swirling blood as<br>it clots or it wants to clot because of<br>the very narrowed Outlet there<br>so once again a quick 40-year tour<br>a brave cardiac surgeon from Japan<br>constructed his own balloon cut down on<br>a vein and did the very first balloon<br>valvuloplasty in patients<br>sort of ignored in the West<br>but this Pediatric Cardiologist Jim<br>read the paper and headed off to India<br>and did a number of cases because lots<br>of rheumatic heart disease and younger<br>people in India<br>there was very nice results obtained<br>he then came back and because<br>basically rheumatic heart disease in<br>Western countries is often in much older<br>people because of antibiotics to stop<br>recurrent throat infections and the<br>development of rheumatic heart disease<br>the cases that were done back in Boston<br>where I happened to be working at the<br>time<br>had very variable results some were<br>great successes and some were absolutely<br>I had been sitting watching these Echoes<br>coming through with my then Mentor Ned<br>Wayman and I would say to him this one<br>will work and this one won't and<br>actually mostly I was kind of right<br>and he said how you know you've got to<br>be able to make some numbers around us<br>mentally I knew this because I'd trained<br>with Pat Malloy<br>the foundational cardiac surgeon in<br>Dunedin<br>who did our operation A Primitive<br>operation by current standards where<br>without putting someone on bypass you<br>put them to sleep of course you'd make a<br>big thoracotomy normal will remember<br>this the lung was deflated and the<br>operating surgeon sewed his finger Into<br>the Heart at the left atrial appendage<br>felt the valve and split it with his<br>finger<br>and those surgeons knew that the<br>patients who had heavily<br>thickened calcified valves wouldn't do<br>well but those that very flexible valves<br>they would split it was so obvious<br>but you can't see that unless you do an<br>echocardiogram I happen to describe the<br>difference between a mobile thickened<br>and calcified valve and gave it some<br>numbers and it turned out that that<br>predicted very nicely who would have a<br>success with this procedure here's such<br>a procedure being done and I guess what<br>I'm showing you here this in a ways<br>original balloon the valve is being held<br>right there the balloon tends to grab it<br>and hold it in that divot and then the<br>valve splits<br>now you can't even see the valve can you<br>that's my point right<br>so in order to understand and do this<br>whole stuff we need to be able to see in<br>the Hat because Katic surgeons can see<br>the valve we can't we need the Imaging<br>tools here's an echo showing the before<br>and after of such a procedure in that<br>very early data<br>and what I was basically saying is that<br>this valve which is just stuck on its<br>tips but it's basically nice and<br>flexible will work and this heavily<br>calcified when when even though we might<br>split it is not going to open up well<br>don't do that one<br>put a new valve and that's a cardiac<br>surgical case<br>data over the next 10 years from just<br>from Mass General many hundreds of cases<br>because it became the center one of the<br>three big centers that did this in the<br>U.S showed that this score called the<br>Wilkins School nowadays<br>at eight it was good to do it and you<br>got a big Improvement but actually after<br>that the success rate was fell you see<br>and the Improvement in the valve area so<br>that in fact<br>I even got the midpoint right in the<br>school because it's out of 16 and about<br>the middle is where you would not a<br>chance that you would not send such a<br>patient<br>What followed then was five randomized<br>trials all using that valve score to<br>select cases in a demonstrated<br>against cardiac surgery the gold<br>standard that the procedure was at least<br>as good equivalence and that was it<br>who would have cardiac surgery if you<br>could have a balloon procedure many of<br>these people are very young and can need<br>be have it again but it's incredibly<br>durable if you do this procedure well<br>so this lesson was that outcomes are<br>predicted by case selection and cardiac<br>structures can be assessed by really<br>good Imaging and these non-invasive<br>tools that were growing in front of me<br>ended up being the key to unlocking a<br>lot of less invasive procedures<br>but you had to do trials and you had to<br>analyze data<br>of course that led this guy a Frenchman<br>and then Crevier to do the stupidest<br>thing I've ever heard of what his<br>cardiac surgeon told him when he dreamed<br>up the idea of putting a valve into the<br>aortic site on a balloon that he made<br>himself<br>and that of course is what we do Anushka<br>and Ben do they did three today of these<br>in people who have severely narrowed<br>aortic valve we just fix it now from the<br>leg with the patient a little sedated<br>but effectively talking to you while you<br>put their new valvein and they walk out<br>of Hospital the next day<br>how do we get there we give there by<br>teaching and training<br>we work as in most Medical Teams within<br>a sort of a team approach where people<br>have different subspecialties the<br>cognitive skills are taught they come as<br>kind of modules there are specific<br>things you need to use<br>that's difficult to write down and so<br>one of my loves and I think one of my<br>contributions has been this talking<br>talking<br>because in the end unless you go through<br>Kate live case demonstrations with<br>faculty expert faculty discussing why<br>you'd do it slightly this way rather<br>than do it that way this is very<br>difficult to pass on<br>and spread across the world but I've<br>been lucky enough to be involved in a<br>lot of that and there are all of these<br>different procedures that I won't dwell<br>on and once again the hero is the<br>Imaging<br>I'm going to quickly as I close show you<br>a couple of kind of interesting things<br>we don't have to do the same thing over<br>and over again because you can design<br>the right thing for this unique<br>situation let me show you this case<br>which is kind of interesting here's an<br>echocadagram which those of you who do<br>Echoes will say that looks a little<br>strange there's another chamber yeah<br>there is<br>this is the left atrium there's the left<br>integral there's something High Velocity<br>that's blood on Doppler Imaging going<br>into something weird<br>when we bring that patient back to<br>Dunedin we can see in a transitology<br>here's the mitral valve here's the<br>aortic valve here's the left ventricle<br>there's a weird hole into a big cavity<br>you know and that cavity is really big<br>that's it there<br>and it shouldn't have anything in there<br>at all<br>and I just want to show you how good CTS<br>are oh come on doesn't want to this runs<br>usually there's a very narrow neck in<br>this Dr ristio will immediately<br>recognize a rare thing called a<br>pseudoanurysm where the wall of the left<br>ventricle has ruptured<br>now how the hell are you going to fix<br>that call the cardiac surgeon would that<br>be the usual answer but in fact you can<br>fix that nowadays the same thing would<br>apply there it is right the same thing<br>would apply to leaks after say<br>infections around valves here's a<br>mechanical valve sitting in a patient<br>and here's a big defect<br>and there's just an enormous amount of<br>high velocity blood leaking around the<br>outside of it now this would be a<br>cardiac surgical case but we can see<br>this in such detail look 3D<br>reconstruction of that valve working<br>with its hinged device you can see even<br>the sutures holding it in there's the<br>hole we can measure the size of it work<br>out the plug work out a strategy we can<br>even work out how to get to that from CT<br>angles of the chest and work out the<br>line of flight<br>so we can fix perivalent leaks and<br>pseudoaneurysms like that so how do we<br>fix that one well you can't get at that<br>you might be able to come around there<br>but there to be difficult it's much<br>easier just to go clean through the wall<br>of the Hat something that we would not<br>usually do but if you plan procedures<br>like this you literally can do that<br>here's exactly that happening<br>right here's a a wire down an artery so<br>we don't hit that<br>and basically we're able to place a wire<br>and then a tube straight through to the<br>edge of a valve<br>how does that look there's lots of<br>Imaging going on here we've got all<br>sorts of images up in a cath lab<br>simultaneously including<br>trans-esophageal Echo Imaging going on<br>because that's where the real<br>information comes from here's my<br>jottings about where I'm going to find<br>the holes there's a hole around the<br>outside of a valve we can see them<br>he is crossing through pulling a plug<br>back into place and moving quickly here<br>there's one plug put in and then there<br>it is right there on the Imaging you can<br>see it's snugged into the hole here's<br>the other hole over the other side so<br>pretty simple matter to put another plug<br>through that one<br>pull that one down you can see these<br>little expanding plugs that are left in<br>place<br>snug it up<br>and leave it so here's one plug here<br>here's another one here and there's the<br>two valves that this patient has and the<br>Imaging is amazing here's one of those<br>valves and there's two little plugs<br>around the side a little bit like Mickey<br>Mouse<br>and of course you've got to plug the<br>hole as you leave through the Apex<br>these things can be done because of the<br>Imaging breakthroughs that happened over<br>that 40 odd years<br>and we can do things that previously we<br>would never be able to do because of<br>those Imaging changes<br>that's led to further first and man<br>trials we're currently working on a one<br>of the most frustrating areas of<br>Cardiology management patients who have<br>something called heart failure with<br>preserved ejection fraction<br>we can show the dramatic rise in and<br>lung pressures that these people have<br>and then we take a tiny little puncture<br>out of the walls between two Chambers to<br>act as a blow-off valve we cause an<br>atrial septostomy<br>he is there and follow up with an MRI<br>you can see this tiny little hole<br>to allow this chamber to be decompressed<br>into that one as people start exercise<br>and the follow-up data suggests that<br>this makes people feel better and we're<br>about to go onto a phase two trial in 77<br>hospitals around the world as a result<br>of this first and Main data that we did<br>in little old Dunedin<br>that hospital<br>as a result of 40 years I've been lucky<br>enough to be involved in the training of<br>22 I think fellows<br>five of whom I've put a little asterixis<br>including Professor Mike Williams and<br>Anushka moyna Sean Coffey shadesh Lao<br>and Peter McLeod have come back and<br>joined on staff and my colleagues<br>and a number of PhD and higher studies<br>candidates who've got their phds sorted<br>out perhaps a little bit by my help I'm<br>just going to show a couple of these<br>things here<br>saranga sanarco has done a trial of just<br>putting the exercise recommendations<br>into place<br>and watching people's blood pressures<br>this is on ambulatory blood pressure who<br>have resistant hypertension so these are<br>people who are on up to three or four<br>drugs to get their blood pressure down<br>and you can see just doing some exercise<br>which has been Charmed before but not<br>that much lowers your blood pressure<br>I've been involved in with Mike uh with<br>Mike with uh Rob Walker and all sorts of<br>animal studies uh looking at the healing<br>of kidneys and heart after heart attacks<br>and ameliorating effects of<br>spironolactone<br>Catherine Leader's PhD came from this<br>data I'm just going to go through it<br>quickly I've been involved with a lot of<br>physiology work with my friend Chris<br>baldy and many of his PhD candidates<br>have come up with the outstanding things<br>and that work continues on<br>it's not all been work I've done the odd<br>thing I've felt an obligation to the<br>National Heart Foundation because of<br>what they did for me you know I got to<br>Boston and enjoyed that<br>so about 10 years ago I ended up with<br>other cardiologists riding the length of<br>New Zealand and I'm pleased to tell you<br>that it only took us 13 days and if you<br>look at some of those distances it's 200<br>plus a day<br>you had to get fit for that we raised 5<br>million for the national Heart<br>Foundation Jenny Shipley was the patron<br>of that and there were no injuries it<br>kind of exhausting though fronting the<br>the uh yeah what do I predict for the<br>future<br>I think there'll be a progressive<br>Relentless drive towards less invasive<br>procedures<br>most new technologies actually currently<br>dovetail into what you can and can't do<br>in cardiac surgery anyway we're not<br>taking it away<br>and we often end up meeting unmet need<br>people who may be just a bit too sick to<br>get through cardiac surgery can be well<br>managed in these other ways<br>of course it'll raise a whole new thing<br>with Fair axis and provision of services<br>but any procedure that avoids anesthesia<br>and open surgery leads to faster<br>discharge and more rapid rehab and of<br>course with the burgeoning older<br>population we're keeping everyone alive<br>longer they often have very treatable<br>disease and it's much better to manage<br>people than minimally invasive manners I<br>think we'll see a steady rate of<br>coronary intervention it hopefully will<br>decline as we get better at getting<br>people on cholesterol lowering drugs and<br>blood pressure agents we'll see a<br>spectacular growth in Tavi procedures<br>and we'll see growth and pacing and<br>percutaneous interventions of all sorts<br>it's now time for me to thank you for<br>coming<br>I'm overwhelmed Honestly by the size of<br>the audience<br>I owe a great debt to the mentors who<br>taught me<br>Norma ristio<br>and Ned Wayman and those in the U.S<br>but I also owe an enormous debt to my<br>own colleagues you know my colleagues<br>today are my biggest support<br>and that includes my cardiac surgical<br>colleagues as well<br>and also to the very skilled nursing<br>staff and Cath Labs Colony candidates<br>and also my dedicated research nurses<br>three of whom stayed with me for 35<br>years<br>and are only just quietly thinking of<br>retiring now<br>I also owe a debt to all the students<br>that I've taught because I've Loved<br>teaching students and I've got to say it<br>keeps me young and keeps my brain Nimble<br>when you get asked questions that you<br>can't readily explain it does make you<br>think simply and that's probably a good<br>idea<br>into my family<br>what can I say thank you<br>thank you for listening I happen to be<br>in the right time in the right place<br>that would sum up my career thank you<br>very much<br>thank you<br>thank you<br>I don't know do I sit down or do I say<br>just stay here I'm okay I think that's<br>yes Jerry you do get your gift but you<br>have to hang on for just a second<br>that's just an amazing talk I really<br>really enjoyed your talk and I think the<br>audience did as well the weather outside<br>is nothing against this hurricane wind<br>of uh Jerry Wilkins to his journey of<br>Cardiology outside is just a Summer<br>Breeze I guess<br>um I loved it how you how you started<br>your journey with uh mentioning the year<br>1979 and you got it in the right order<br>because you do want to have dinner at<br>some point again tonight yes um you<br>mentioned Barb first as the first<br>experiment and then you graduated I<br>don't know if that was the right order<br>but at least that's that's how you<br>brought it across thank you so much of<br>course a cardiologist talks about Rhythm<br>and you had to start with music<br>um that that was a given but<br>um saving lives is is really the motto<br>that we heard here tonight and and you<br>really played a really big part in that<br>when you showed these graphs of of<br>diminishing mortality obviously as a<br>gastroenterologist I would say well this<br>is cancer screening but it's not it's<br>cardiac mortality it's it's really your<br>organ rather than the organ that I work<br>with that saves lives I'm hoping you'll<br>get there oh God yeah it will take a<br>while<br>um between 1978 and 2002 stopping harder<br>takes that's a term I have never heard<br>before but obviously that was the big<br>deal that you you could or where then<br>eventually able to stop a heart attack<br>from getting worse and worse and worse<br>in taking the whole organite that was<br>fantastic introducing us to Mega trials<br>well yes thousands of patients are<br>needed and isn't it exciting if you have<br>such a illustrious career and a<br>long-standing career that many of the<br>things Jerry mentioned that are that<br>have been in trial situations during<br>your time are just given metoprolol I<br>mean who would not know metoprol but<br>obviously it was against the placebo is<br>that even ethical only from from where<br>we're standing now probably not anymore<br>but absolutely amazing your journey<br>through Interventional Cardiology you<br>said someone had to do it someone had to<br>start it I also liked it that you can<br>teach monkeys to do it but that's a<br>different why do we employ so many<br>cardio never mind one of Horsemen yes<br>they are always these Pioneers in<br>medicine who try things themselves and<br>uh he truly was a Pioneer you mentioned<br>several times you were just at the right<br>place at the right time well I think<br>it's a bit more than that isn't it it<br>takes a brave man to take on these<br>challenges but also a man who sits down<br>and thinks about these things who<br>doesn't go recklessly into somebody's<br>heart who really thinks about what can<br>be done what should be done and what's<br>what's good for that person<br>199 Publications just on these Mega<br>trials alone with impact factors of 74<br>and more that is amazing when I read<br>your resume<br>and you you came up to the department<br>said hmm I I think I should apply for<br>for promotion and this is my resume my<br>immediate response was why why didn't<br>you do it 10 years ago 15 years ago<br>honestly I mean it was such a I was too<br>busy actually<br>I now realize that you had to save lives<br>you were just too busy and that's the<br>humble person that you are hardware<br>store on the weekends here some of the<br>things you talked about tonight you<br>probably got at the hardware store so<br>I'm not sure what Med saves says about<br>that uh first in main trial strike<br>eluding stencil I mean you you must have<br>done it all it's really the fundamental<br>stuff that we take for granted that you<br>were part of developing and and that you<br>still part of developing taking on the<br>cardiac surgeons that's a that's a good<br>thing if I remember dick Bunton right I<br>mean he's about two heads taller and a<br>bit more massive while taking him on and<br>he's he's stitching his finger into a<br>heart and you just replaced him by a<br>balloon not bad I say not bad your cath<br>lab really looks now like Starship<br>Enterprise it's not like it did look in<br>the past<br>plugging holes you're probably the guy<br>who everybody wants to have around when<br>the roof leaks fantastic stuff I thank<br>you so much for<br>um the work you've done I even more<br>thank you for the teaching I thank you<br>for all the other things that you have<br>done over your many years of of that I<br>think it's Testament that you had so<br>many uh trainees so many students that<br>awarded you and that came back to the<br>department I think that's the the best<br>Testament that you're a fantastic<br>teacher you're a fantastic guy I'm<br>really proud to be your colleague and on<br>behalf of the University you don't know<br>what's in there I know I never guess<br>never guess I thank you very much thank<br>you Michael we all break out into<br>another round of thank you uh can I<br>please invite everybody to join uh Jerry<br>and the rest of the academic party to<br>come over to the staff Club to have a<br>well well deserved refreshments and a<br>few of uh our personal moments with with<br>Jerry thank you very much for coming<br>tonight thank you very much thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
