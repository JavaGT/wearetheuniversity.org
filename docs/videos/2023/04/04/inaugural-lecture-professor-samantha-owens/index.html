explores the music making that took<br>place in New Zealand's streets and urban<br>parks around the turn of the 20th<br>century<br>and what she will do is delve into what<br>this music making tells us about the<br>cultural and social diversity of<br>Owens it's my very great pleasure to<br>invite Professor Samantha Owens to the<br>podium to give her inaugural lecture<br>thank you<br>thank you very much Provost and thank<br>you everyone for coming tonight<br>including my family my friends and<br>colleagues<br>foreign<br>choice to make<br>for tonight's lecture<br>between two different research areas<br>centuries apart and centered on<br>different sides of the globe<br>whether to speak about music in late<br>17th and 18th century Germany on the one<br>hand or about music in late 19th and<br>early 20th century australasia on the<br>other<br>in both of these fields I've always been<br>particularly interested in the place of<br>Music in society<br>and above all in the Practical realities<br>of making a living from music and in<br>fact one of my current projects together<br>with the German Canadian colleague<br>Barbara Royal is a book on musicians and<br>time I first started to consider<br>possible topics for this talk I was<br>writing a conference paper that dealt<br>with unauthorized music making on the<br>streets of 17th century Stuttgart<br>which is a city in which I've spent a<br>lot of time over the past 30 years I can<br>hardly believe it doing research in the<br>state archives at a library<br>in a roundabout way that conference<br>paper got me thinking about the types of<br>music that can be heard on Wellington<br>streets in 2023 and the challenges faced<br>by buskers in today's essentially<br>cashless Society<br>with many of us absorbed in our own<br>private sound worlds excuse me stored in<br>our smartphones as we hurried down<br>Lambton key or Willis Street largely<br>oblivious to any public music making<br>that may be taking place around us<br>of course as surviving documents from<br>17th century Stuttgart make very clear<br>buskers have always received mixed<br>responses from the public<br>and I can also attest to this from<br>personal experience having occasionally<br>busked with fellow music students on the<br>streets of Wellington in the late 1980s<br>but those are stories for another time<br>and stark contrast to my own encounters<br>as a busker though some musicians become<br>regular and much appreciated performers<br>on a city streets<br>this is certainly the case with the<br>professionally trained urhu player and<br>composer sin gang Huang and here he is<br>playing in the subway of Wellington's<br>railway station in July 2021<br>um<br>foreign<br>perfectly music can serve not only as a<br>powerful expression of creativity and<br>artistry<br>but also of cultural National and ethnic<br>identity<br>and I'm sure that most of you recognize<br>the tunes that he was playing<br>in Wellington perhaps the most<br>enduringly popular occasion on which<br>music is heard on the streets is the<br>vibrantly Multicultural Cuba Street<br>Carnival which is which was revived and<br>rebranded in 2015 as Cuba duper<br>oh yeah<br>thank you<br>so as that video makes clear this annual<br>event which next happens later this<br>month is well known for its<br>transformation of urban city streets to<br>a zone of music making and social<br>revelry<br>as such the festival's been studied by<br>ethnomusicologist Shelly Brunt<br>who describes it as a site for the<br>presentation of distinctive musical<br>practices of cultural groups where<br>musical performances can serve as a<br>visible form of cultural recognition and<br>some of you might recognize some School<br>of Music students on that slide<br>in her discussion brunt cites the<br>comments of one attendee of the 2009<br>Cuba Street Carnival<br>second generation Chinese New Zealand<br>New Zealander Linda lims who noted that<br>quote it was nice to see the Asian<br>Community who've been such an important<br>part of Wellington for so long become an<br>integral part of the event it shows that<br>we've really been accepted as part of<br>Wellington's Community to finally be<br>involved in such an iconic event for the<br>city<br>yet the Cuba Street Carnival in the<br>early years of the 21st century wasn't<br>actually the first time that<br>Wellington's Chinese Community had been<br>represented through musical performance<br>on the streets of the city<br>almost 120 years earlier in May 1891<br>procession through the city streets<br>featured a lorry with a dozen Chinese<br>playing musical instruments quote<br>peculiar to their country<br>this was part of an electric light<br>Carnival which raised money for the<br>Parnell memorial fund commemorating<br>Samuel Parnell founder of the eight-hour<br>workday movement<br>and I'm sorry I couldn't find any um<br>photographs of that actual event but<br>here are two images of members of the<br>Wellington Chinese Community dating from<br>the 1920s<br>Chinese musicians are also known to have<br>performed on Wellington streets a decade<br>later in June 1901<br>when a Chinese band played from the<br>Chinese citizens arch in Manor Street<br>and you can see in the upper right hand<br>picture here that it was possible to<br>stand on the top of the arch if you look<br>closely you can see two men standing<br>there<br>organized by three local businessmen<br>Chao Fong Yae Chong and Wong XI this was<br>one of the many decorated triumphal<br>arches through which the Duke and<br>Duchess of Cornwall and York later<br>George V and Queen Mary passed as part<br>of their Whirlwind tour of ayatiro<br>during their visit to Wellington the<br>Juco couple heard many types of Music<br>performed by musicians of different<br>genders and ages both amateur and<br>professional and drawn from<br>representatives of a range of<br>ethnicities and National groups<br>string bands played background music for<br>a state reception at Parliament House<br>for example while another evening High<br>Point was a comic Opera performed by a<br>group of amateur musicians under the<br>direction of Leipzig train conductor Max<br>Hopper and here's a picture of him<br>leading the Wellington orchestral<br>society and if you look closely you'll<br>notice that roughly one quarter of the<br>plays in this picture are women but<br>that's a topic for my expert colleague<br>ingevan Ray<br>Duchess also heard a choir of 250 voices<br>singing ode specially composed by<br>Wellington City organist Mormon Barnett<br>at the Lang of the foundation stone of<br>the Wellington Town Hall<br>while later that same day an<br>estudiantina band comprising 24<br>performers On the Banjo guitar and<br>mandolin with a star attraction at a<br>so-called Maori land fate a fundraising<br>Venture for the Victoria home for<br>incurables and I couldn't find a picture<br>of the Wellington group but so here<br>standing in for them as a Christchurch<br>banjo mandolin and guitar Orchestra from<br>1907. so this is a type of Spanish<br>influenced Ensemble that was very<br>popular in these years<br>but what's particularly striking to me<br>about the Music performed for the Duke<br>and Duchess of Cornwall in June 1901 is<br>that a significant amount of it took<br>place Outdoors<br>even at the start of a bitter Wellington<br>winter<br>perhaps this is hardly surprising given<br>the specific context of a royal tour but<br>nevertheless it seems to me worth<br>considering in more depth<br>with a few notable exceptions Chief<br>among them Stanley newcomb's work on the<br>Brass Band movement in New Zealand and<br>Alan Thomas's ethnographic study of<br>hawera in 1946<br>music historians have tended to overlook<br>music making on the city streets of<br>ayoteroa<br>actually this isn't at all unusual<br>internationally<br>pointed out by Paul watt in the<br>Routledge Handbook of Street culture<br>even studies of Street culture often<br>Passover or marginalize the rich<br>soundscapes of streets<br>yet what also notes that more recently a<br>number of Scholars have started to trace<br>the history of Street musicians in a<br>wide range of countries<br>um and I should note that New Zealand<br>does get uh two mentions in this<br>particular book but both are to work<br>that I've published which is flattering<br>but very frustrating at the same time<br>given that Street Music has largely been<br>ignored by scholars in preparing this<br>lecture I was curious to explore how<br>much music and of what types Was Heard<br>outdoors in colonial era Wellington<br>and furthermore I wanted to consider<br>or at least more realistically to begin<br>to consider what that can tell us about<br>the cultural and social diversity of<br>Wellington in the Years Around 1900<br>since music heard Outdoors on the<br>streets and in public parks could be<br>enjoyed and on occasion suffered by all<br>members of society regardless of their<br>age ethnicity or economic status<br>now I'd like to stress at this point<br>that the research I'm presenting in<br>tonight's lecture doesn't represent a<br>comprehensive survey in any way I'd need<br>years for that and I didn't have that<br>amount of time<br>furthermore I'm going to set aside<br>whistling<br>Street cries the tolling of bells and<br>Chimes and noise are showing forth from<br>music shops which were all sounds that<br>contributed to the rich soundscape of<br>Wellington's streets and were described<br>very nostalgically by Pat Lawler the<br>journalist writing about his boyhood in<br>the city in the early 1900s<br>I've drawn mainly on contemporary<br>newspapers and surviving photographs for<br>This research and have chosen to focus<br>chiefly on the years around 1900 in<br>effect taking an oral snapshot although<br>to the best of my knowledge and I'm<br>happy to be told otherwise there are no<br>actual recordings of Wellington Street<br>Music that survived from this time<br>broadly speaking the music Hooter doors<br>in Wellington during this period can be<br>divided into two main categories<br>day-to-day busking and music for special<br>occasions as we've already seen both<br>these types have persisted in Wellington<br>right up till the present day<br>it's perhaps easiest to start or deal<br>first with Buskers<br>some of whom were a regular presence on<br>Wellington streets<br>perhaps the most well-known was Charles<br>David Evans generally referred to as<br>Piccolo Charlie<br>who played the Tin Whistle usually on<br>Lambton key he was actually educated at<br>King's College Cambridge and in France<br>and had worked as a gold miner in<br>Australia and New Zealand but by the<br>early 1900s had fallen on hard times and<br>was frequently arrested in Wellington<br>for vagrancy as well as for drunk and<br>organ Grinders were also frequently<br>heard on the streets of Wellington City<br>including an Italian whose name is<br>unknown who played operatic Arias and<br>attracted additional attention thanks to<br>his monkey<br>which was kept on a chain in war Crimson<br>trousers and a cap and I don't have a<br>photo of him but this guy's standing in<br>for that Wellington Italian<br>sometime in early 1904 Wellington heard<br>its first street phonograph how exciting<br>that would have been and by 1909 there<br>were multiple Street phonograph<br>operators working throughout the<br>downtown area<br>and New Zealand times description of<br>Christmas Eve in the city refers to the<br>Happy crowds of Shoppers thronging the<br>streets where every man with a street<br>phonograph was at his post of Duty hands<br>vigorously playing Christmas carols<br>two further categories of buskers heard<br>regularly on Wellington streets in these<br>years were clearly demarcated along<br>National lines the German bands and the<br>Italian bands respectively<br>both types of ensembles were made up of<br>men from certain towns and impoverished<br>regions of their respective homelands<br>that specialized in itinerant<br>professional musicians<br>the Germans were normally from the<br>westfalls or Western palatinate in<br>Southwestern Germany just on the border<br>with France while the Italians tended to<br>come from the region of basilica in<br>southern Italy<br>it's can be seen in this contemporary<br>Australian illustration a key difference<br>between the two types of bands was that<br>when playing Outdoors Italian bands<br>typically comprised a combination of a<br>full-sized harp plus boat string<br>instruments such as a violin or cello<br>whereas the German bands tended to<br>specialize in the performance of wind<br>instruments and I was really thrilled to<br>find these photographs of both types the<br>German and the Italian in action on<br>Lambton key to include in this talk I<br>mean you have to sort of squint to see<br>the German band but they're there<br>standing on the street just by the<br>pavement<br>so their size German bands range from<br>between 6 to 12 players while Italian<br>bands could be a similar size but<br>appeared more frequently as a duo or<br>Trio<br>on the question of repertoire German and<br>Italian bands mainly performed music<br>drawn from their own cultural heritage<br>above all Arrangements of Opera Arias or<br>overtures waltzes and other dance music<br>and I'm going to play you an example of<br>a number of popular songs that were<br>composed around this time that centered<br>on the global phenomenon of the German<br>band and they usually parodying them as<br>you'll hear this one was composed in<br>1931 by Americans Matt Gordon and Harry<br>Revel and if you listen closely you'll<br>hear that Wagner list Bach and the<br>popular Viennese composer Oscar Strauss<br>are all mentioned in the song and this<br>is a recording made in 1932 by the<br>I love you<br>foreign<br>while around the people's gone to home<br>and sing and whistle couples meet stands<br>on the street after they've been a<br>schnitzel and they keep the musicals<br>from Valentines and Nicholas so the<br>musicals confide ours and Records the<br>so in that recording<br>you may have also picked up a reference<br>to the Irish Street ballad the wearing<br>of the green<br>since German bands also regularly played<br>whatever was familiar to or popular with<br>their target audiences including folk<br>songs national anthems and popular songs<br>among them patriotic numbers such as<br>Rule Britannia and soldiers of the queen<br>as specifically mentioned in this<br>newspaper report from 1899 excuse me<br>so this is called the lady cyclist and<br>the German band and I can't resist<br>reading it out to you the narrowness of<br>Willis Street Wellington is continually<br>making itself apparent through the<br>collisions that take place there last<br>Saturday morning says the New Zealand<br>times the German bandsmen realized this<br>to their discomforture a young lady<br>evidently a beginner braved the place on<br>a bicycle<br>she was getting along splendidly when<br>the air soldiers of the queen was<br>commenced<br>this tune seemed to have a peculiar<br>attraction for her for getting up a good<br>speed with the aid of the incline she<br>charged wildly into the midst of the<br>innocent musicians the sudden cessation<br>of the music a flattering man a<br>flattering Mass on the ground and Roars<br>of derision from The Spectators produced<br>a scene of absurd confusion<br>the music stance was scattered and two<br>bandsmen finding themselves so suddenly<br>Seated on the ground fled wildly at the<br>strange intruder the young lady however<br>nothing daunted but proceeded on her<br>journey in a series of graceful curves<br>after the lapse of about five minutes<br>the band pulled itself together again<br>and finished the popular selection<br>I've written Elsewhere on German bands<br>in New Zealand they were very common<br>from about the 1850s until the outbreak<br>of the first World War<br>one band leader Rudolf Mercy seen here<br>in around 1905 and he's the short man in<br>the middle of the first row<br>made frequent tours to New Zealand from<br>Germany and was among 12 unfortunate<br>German band members and turned on Mateus<br>Island for the duration of World War One<br>I still have more research to do on<br>Italian bands in New Zealand although<br>other Scholars have already investigated<br>their activity in Australia and<br>elsewhere including a book by John Zuki<br>on Italian child Street musicians and<br>19th Century Paris London and New York<br>in Wellington they included Giuseppe<br>pisani a harpist from viajano in the<br>basilicata region a town known for its<br>musicians who also had a regular gig on<br>the day's Bay fairy<br>accompanied by another of his countrymen<br>on the violin and Pat Lawler waxes<br>lyrical about hearing their gentle<br>obligato born on the wings of a<br>Wellington Breeze describing them both<br>as picturesque straw-headed Italians<br>in the mid-1890s several members of the<br>vitetza family immigrated from grumento<br>Nova in basilicata to Wellington where<br>they began playing on the streets but<br>soon proved much in demand with<br>Wellington's wealthier residents who<br>frequently engaged them for garden<br>parties and at homes as reported in the<br>social Columns of local newspapers<br>and here are two advertisements placed<br>by the viteta brothers in the New<br>Zealand times and they also had a<br>regular gig at Cuba Street's Royal Oak<br>hotel which you can see in that picture<br>by 1915 though the viteta family had<br>moved to Nelson where they continued to<br>work as musicians but they were also<br>significant players in the local tomato<br>growing industry and that's why the<br>picture of the harp here is taken in<br>front of a glass house<br>German bands also played indoors on<br>occasion mostly on string instruments<br>which is why there are generally both<br>winds and strings in posed photos of<br>German bands from this time however more<br>often they were engaged to perform<br>Outdoors on-wind instruments<br>and for this reason the musicians who<br>play in one corner of the tennis court<br>and Catherine Mansfield's short story<br>the garden party which was apparently<br>inspired by an event that took place in<br>the Wellington Garden in 1907 is most<br>likely to have been a German band in<br>military style uniform<br>Mansfield describes them as a green<br>coated band and they were almost<br>certainly playing wind instruments not<br>the cello the violin flute and piano is<br>depicted in the otherwise extremely<br>excellent Hamilton Gardens Recreation of<br>this scene<br>German bands were also frequently<br>employed to enliven significant events<br>held in The Wider community<br>over the summer of 1903 to four for<br>example Rudolph mersey's band which we<br>saw earlier played at the fifth annual<br>Carnival of the Swift swimming club at<br>Tiaro Baths on the lawn at Days Bay as<br>part of the King's birthday celebrations<br>organized by the Wellington steam Ferry<br>company at the annual sports day of<br>girls high school now Wellington girls<br>college and on many more occasions<br>besides I've got huge lists of stuff<br>mentioned in the newspaper of what they<br>were doing<br>all of these examples are of course<br>music provided for special occasions so<br>I've moved from busking now firmly into<br>that category<br>the visit of the of the Duke and Duchess<br>of Cornwall in June 1901 provides a<br>nicely focused snapshot of some of the<br>performances that were heard Outdoors<br>for such festive events<br>in addition to the group of Chinese<br>musicians mentioned at the beginning of<br>my talk the royal couple or also<br>experienced wayata and hakka presented<br>by a party of Maori at the Maori Arch<br>which also included children stationed<br>in the roof of the arch who chanted<br>while stamping their feet<br>groups capable of marching while<br>performing of course played a major role<br>as well as is still the case with some<br>Street parades today including bagpipers<br>and here's just one bagpipe band passing<br>through the Westport Arch the Royals<br>didn't go to the West Coast so that they<br>had to have this this arch in Wellington<br>bagpipe is often played for St Patrick's<br>Day parades and on festive occasions<br>celebrated by Wellington's Scottish<br>community<br>in 1898 for example before the first<br>annual ball of the Scottish thistle Club<br>four Pipers of the club marched through<br>the principal streets of the city and<br>played stirring National selections<br>and here's a picture of children heading<br>from Saint Mary the angels on bulkot<br>street to the railway station for the<br>annual Catholic picnic held at father<br>Lane's Gardens in lower Hutt and the<br>tall man you can see on the right is<br>actually Pat Lawler's father<br>so I can only imagine that Pat Lawler is<br>perhaps one of the children in this<br>Photograph as well<br>not surprisingly numerous brass bands<br>also participated in the 1901 Royal tour<br>festivities<br>among them groups associated with<br>certain Wellington suburbs such as the<br>Newtown band schools such as St<br>Patrick's College Band The City<br>Salvation Army Band and many visiting<br>Regional brass bands such as those from<br>wanganui fielding and pahiatua just to<br>name three there's huge numbers of brass<br>bands that are listed as playing in 1901<br>for the royal couple<br>a notable admission from this list<br>however was the celebrated<br>otaki Maori band a group led by<br>wellington-born and based musician<br>Salvatore Cimino<br>established in the later months of 1891<br>by June the following year the band had<br>been invited to Wellington to take part<br>in celebrations marking the reception of<br>a new government governor of New Zealand<br>as well as taking part in a public<br>procession on the day of their arrival<br>in Wellington the otaki Maori band quote<br>played through the principal streets at<br>midday their neat uniform good playing<br>and excellent marching attracting much<br>favorable comment<br>to be the first of many occasions upon<br>which the band performed in Wellington<br>and you can see another one on the slide<br>so they're arriving at the Basin Reserve<br>for the Maori Carnival which was a<br>fundraising event for Boer War soldiers<br>by the time the Duke and Duchess of<br>Cornwall made it to Wellington in June<br>1901 the otaki Maori band had actually<br>already played for them in Rotorua with<br>thousands of Maori from ewe across the<br>country presented a welcome and cultural<br>display<br>the 1890s had seen the formation of many<br>brass bands in Maori communities and<br>when the Maori King mahuta tafio visited<br>Wellington at the government's<br>invitation in September to October 1900<br>he brought with him to Maori brass bands<br>the Kiora Brass Band of around 18<br>players and the Nayana band<br>these two bands delighted audience at<br>numerous events including at the Labor<br>Day Sports meeting at the Basin Reserve<br>where one of the Bands also performed<br>haka at the exchange Hall where they<br>played popular selections and at the<br>band rotunda on gervoy's key at the<br>invitation of the Wellington City<br>Council<br>these two bands also delighted passes by<br>on several occasions and all of this is<br>reported in the newspapers by playing<br>outside the king's Hotel on molesworth<br>Street including a performance of the<br>Dead March from Handel's oratorio's Saul<br>when the king suffered a double<br>bereavement during his visit and this<br>peace the dead March from Saul had been<br>very famously played at the massive<br>State funeral of Lord Horacio Nelson in<br>1806 and subsequently it gets performed<br>at all the Royal funerals for a while<br>including Elizabeth II recently only<br>Queen Victoria who couldn't stand<br>handles music didn't have it played at<br>her funeral and it still also played at<br>the funerals of Tongan royalty as well<br>okay so in many ways in this paper I<br>have only scratched the surface of music<br>making heard in Wellington's streets and<br>parks in the Years Around 1900.<br>I haven't touched in any depth on Music<br>performed in the city's many band<br>rotunders a subject that many of you<br>will know is very dear to my heart<br>they featured regular public<br>performances by local and visiting bands<br>I haven't touched on music in any depth<br>at public demonstrations or in funeral<br>processions which often featured<br>bagpipers Salvation Army bands and other<br>brass bands and I found this great photo<br>of a funeral procession on Arrow Street<br>for those of you from the Arrow Valley<br>with a band Brass Band there<br>and there are many many more examples of<br>Music Hood outdoors in the city streets<br>nor have I begun to analyze the often<br>complicated Dynamics between the ethnic<br>and National identities of the<br>performers the choice of repertoire they<br>played and what their performances<br>represented both to themselves and to<br>those members of the public listening<br>in fact there's very little surviving<br>information regarding how such ephemeral<br>performances were received by those who<br>heard them<br>only the occasional comment provides<br>evidence of more complex readings on the<br>part of wellingtonians<br>during the second Boer War for example<br>in January 1902 the 600 plus<br>participants in the second Moonlight<br>cycle Excursion<br>from the general post office to kill<br>Bernie were reassured in the newspaper<br>that they were to be entertained by an<br>Italian band not as was first stated by<br>a German band therefore they need have<br>no misgivings on the score of patriotism<br>so Germany was supporting the opposition<br>in the Boer War so the Italians that<br>were safe you could come along listen to<br>them<br>what I have hoped to demonstrate however<br>is that the music making heard on<br>Wellington's streets in the Years Around<br>1900 was rather more culturally and<br>socially diverse than white previously<br>have been imagined<br>importantly all of this music not only<br>added color and spectacle to life in the<br>city both day to day and on special<br>occasions but it was free to the general<br>public including to children as well as<br>to those adults who were not able to<br>afford music lessons instruments tickets<br>to concerts and theatrical performances<br>or a gramophone<br>long may similar performances<br>representative of the city's Rich<br>diversity continued to take place on the<br>streets of<br>Wellington now Mickey<br>correct<br>good evening everybody I'm Simon<br>McKenzie I am a professor of criminology<br>in the faculty of humanities and social<br>sciences where Sam works and I'm<br>currently the acting dean of the faculty<br>and it's my pleasure and privilege this<br>evening to offer the vote of thanks on<br>behalf of us all to Sam for her<br>inaugural lecture as professor of<br>musicology and tekuki the New Zealand<br>School of Music here at tehringa Walker<br>it's lovely to hear about the history of<br>Wellington's vibrant music scene and to<br>see it Illustrated in this way by such<br>an expert is a rare treat<br>I was I granted by the middle and I was<br>thinking<br>I couldn't really enjoy this anymore<br>this is lovely and then the bagpipes<br>came in and I thought this is next level<br>I can't I can't believe there's Scott's<br>in there as well<br>um they're not universally loved in<br>Scotland it's a closely held secret<br>they're a bit of a Vegemite sort of love<br>them or hate them kind of thing the<br>bagpipes I've got uh my uncle lives in<br>Aberdeen and he reckons you can get the<br>same kind of music if you like Stanley<br>stand on your cat<br>um but personally I love them so I think<br>it's a a wonderful thing to see them<br>stirring the heartstrings of homesick<br>Celts up and down the streets of<br>Wellington the long way that continue<br>so it's been a celebration of the<br>multiculturalism of Wellington it's all<br>through a Street Music Scene<br>um<br>there's a lot in there isn't there<br>packaged up in the stories of<br>immigration and belonging and the<br>stories of representing your culture<br>through musical Traditions as a way to<br>practice identity<br>um bringing aspects of your culture to<br>this side of the world along with visits<br>from British Royals on tour and<br>um historical moments like the Earl of<br>Glasgow my hometown becoming the<br>governor of New Zealand in in 1890 which<br>was one of the the references that Sam<br>had there and when you put it like that<br>and you start to think about it in that<br>sort of context it's impossible to see<br>the archive pictures without<br>um challenging political questions being<br>raised about colonialism and the issues<br>of who's here in Wellington and and how<br>to wrote generally and how and why<br>um and Sam sort of alluded to some of<br>those issues<br>um it's important I think to acknowledge<br>the tensions in any discussion about<br>multiculturalism and identity and<br>belonging in our great City<br>but music is one of the great<br>cross-cultural positive forces and isn't<br>it is that particular kind of language<br>that allows us to come together to<br>engage with each other wherever we're<br>from so to some extent a musical<br>multiculturalism seems a lot less<br>fraught than the wider questions of<br>colonialism and now decolonization<br>because music is one of the social<br>forces which for the most part ties us<br>together rather than driving us apart<br>and I think Sam's done a great job of<br>helping us to see and hear the music<br>from that era and made a persuasive case<br>for why a musical history is an<br>important component of historical<br>studies and their political contemporary<br>relevance more generally<br>so I knew someone was going to talk<br>about Wellington Street Music I also<br>knew that as she said it was going to be<br>a difficult choice for her because she's<br>quite an Eclectic scholar and<br>um not everybody is some people are<br>quite narrow and they're thorough but<br>some people have a real breadth of<br>scholarship and then you come to give an<br>inaugural lecture and suddenly you're<br>supposed to kind of sum up your<br>everything in in the one and you've got<br>45 minutes and it's a tough choice and<br>it could have been German Baroque and it<br>could have been<br>um it turned out to be Wellington Street<br>Music I spoke to Sally Jane the head of<br>school about it and she gave me a little<br>preview into your interest in New<br>Zealand bandstands<br>um a little bit of kiwiana dropped in<br>there and then I went back and read some<br>of your papers and discovered a mutual<br>interest that you and I have in the<br>history of the emotions which is the the<br>big Australian Grand that Wendy<br>mentioned at the beginning<br>um I wonder whether everybody else here<br>knows that emotions had a history I<br>expect generally people probably aren't<br>aware of that sort of thing I thought<br>maybe I'd say a couple of words to try<br>to help you to see the breadth of the<br>scholar behind the lecture as it were so<br>that um Sam doesn't sort of suffer the<br>figure of having to make that choice and<br>then nobody sees what else is behind<br>them<br>um so there's a whole Rich field of<br>research concerned with variations in<br>emotions across cultures and throughout<br>history both the experience of emotions<br>and their expression so<br>um wait a minute the the expression of<br>emotions we can imagine I think how that<br>might vary across history it's quite<br>clear that the way that we express<br>emotions now might be different in terms<br>of the rules that that sort of control<br>it than how it was in previous<br>historical periods but um the field<br>isn't just about the expression of the<br>emotions it's also about the experience<br>of the emotions can emotions have been<br>not only expressed differently in the<br>past but actually experienced<br>differently the things that we feel now<br>are not the same things that feel in the<br>past question mark well um that's a<br>pretty pretty wild proposition when you<br>think about it but a lot of the evidence<br>that we have coming out in the field of<br>the emotions tends to suggest that<br>um the answer to that question is is yes<br>we think of emotions or um the passions<br>as they were previously called as<br>inbuilt As Natural as something that's<br>inside and that comes out and uh built<br>into that assumption that they're<br>natural is an assumption that they are<br>therefore Timeless but<br>um that's not right we learn about how<br>to show emotion from social cues as we<br>grow up and this in turn shapes our<br>sensible emotions are and in doing that<br>Society shapes the things that we feel<br>inside so actually what's inside comes<br>to an extent from what's outside so it<br>feels natural but it's actually heavily<br>influenced by social structures and<br>these have changed over time of course<br>the emotional regimes as they're called<br>the codes the rules of what you're<br>allowed and encouraged to feel these are<br>historically variable and in terms of<br>Sam's research while I'm talking about<br>social structures and their influence on<br>the emotions of course music is one of<br>those structures and musicologists like<br>Sam are among the key people who are<br>contributing to this Global discipline<br>in emotional history music is intimately<br>tied to the emotions and the lecture<br>tonight has begun to bring out some of<br>those underlying questions about the<br>relationship between music performance<br>and feelings the questions about what<br>people were thinking and feeling when<br>they took part in this street music<br>scene as performers or or as audience<br>we've been transported back tonight to a<br>fascinating era in the timeline of<br>Wellington's development as a world city<br>we've been immersed for a short time in<br>the idea of what it would have been like<br>to wander the Streets back then and then<br>to see the modern version of that in the<br>video of Cuba duper brings the<br>historical right alongside the<br>Contemporary and we can go home tonight<br>or and all of us mulling the issues of<br>continuity and change in the musical<br>backdrop to our city and in the cultural<br>arts scene and in society more generally<br>so thank you Sam for that<br>an entertaining lecture with lots of<br>deep themes running through it so I hope<br>that gives you a little um sort of<br>window into some of the the other<br>academic areas that sounds contributed<br>to over the years<br>um I couldn't end without running up to<br>my own recent embroglio with the<br>Wellington Street Music Scene a century<br>later than the formative era that's been<br>the subject of Sam's talk<br>um actually I probably could end and I<br>probably should but I started a nicer<br>here we are<br>I I some of my closer friends know um<br>and now as all of you will soon know<br>um I am a and have been over the years<br>an on off member of a variety of uh<br>hapless and deservedly unsuccessful Pub<br>rock bands and<br>um so I was practicing with the latest<br>version of these in uh not in the street<br>mind you in a legitimate practice room<br>soundproof and everything<br>um down in Arrow Valley but it was a hot<br>day and we'd left the window open and we<br>were hacking our way through<br>um a very<br>um<br>ill-advised version of motorheads the<br>Ace of Spades<br>and some people were walking past in the<br>street and they complained to the<br>council about it<br>and uh so sort of an inadvertent<br>participant in Wellington's Street Music<br>Scene<br>um and still quite salty about it as you<br>can probably tell it's uh so I'm a bit<br>triggered Now by that constellation of<br>words Wellington Street and music<br>being indelibly in record in one of the<br>council's basement archives as having<br>been um<br>emitting polluting noise into the<br>Wellington streetscape<br>which I have to say is a hopeful I went<br>to a musician with a fragile Eagle it's<br>not the most encouraging feedback to<br>receive<br>but tonight the dial has switched for me<br>back from hate towards love for<br>Wellington Street Music caught up as we<br>all have been in Sam's warm and<br>appreciative rendition of how things<br>were so um on that ear of piercing<br>offensive publicly offensive musical<br>note let me invite you all to join us<br>for a drink through those doors and some<br>convivial conversation let me say<br>Sam on behalf of the Wellington faculty<br>of humanities and social sciences we are<br>so very proud to have you working among<br>our number and on behalf of all of us<br>here tonight thank you for the<br>entertaining lecture uh one more<br>appreciative Round of Applause please</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
