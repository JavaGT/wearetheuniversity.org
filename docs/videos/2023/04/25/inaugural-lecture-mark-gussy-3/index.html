accurate.</p><p>hello everybody<br>um I'm surprised and pleased to see so<br>many people here tonight it's just great<br>to know that people have an interest in<br>oral health because sometimes it's a<br>difficult thing to sell to people<br>particularly decision makers and those<br>who have to part with money I've been a<br>little bit provocative and perhaps<br>mischievous in the title that I've given<br>my presentation tonight and I want to<br>say up front that I'm not here to talk<br>about the failings of the dental<br>profession or the failings of the system<br>that supports dental care but to start a<br>conversation about<br>where we are in terms of oral health<br>where we've got stuck maybe and and some<br>potential ways of moving forward because<br>we seem to be at an impasse where<br>clinical dentistry and other approaches<br>to dealing with dental health problems<br>have sort of reached their limitations<br>as to what what can be achieved so I'd<br>like to provoke a little bit of<br>conversation tonight<br>and<br>maybe put forward some some ideas that<br>that will help us to overcome what's<br>been called a wicked problem of poor<br>poor dental health so I want to start<br>where I began which is when I graduated<br>um in the early 90s so this is I don't<br>know whether you can spot me in this<br>group but this is the Wes Morton School<br>Dental team I look about 12 years old<br>but I assure you I was fully qualified<br>and adult<br>but this is where I started my career<br>and as Duncan said I worked in the<br>school dental service in Queensland we<br>traveled around in a silver Caravan to<br>remote and Rural communities treating<br>dental caries and because I was in the<br>school dental service Dental caries of<br>children uh<br>and and Adolescence and it was a great<br>life I enjoyed it it was fantastic place<br>to be in the communities we went to were<br>wonderful and we had a great time<br>when I graduated at the graduation<br>speech the chief Dental officer said to<br>us the cohort<br>you will be the first cohort of dental<br>professionals to treat yourself out of a<br>job<br>Dental caries at that time in the early<br>90s or dental decay the rates were<br>coming down and it was probably due to<br>widespread fluoridation and the use of<br>fluoride toothpaste and and maybe the<br>contribution of the school Dental<br>Service as well uh but they but we were<br>going to treat ourselves out of a job<br>and I thought cool that's that's<br>brilliant I get to retire early so I I<br>went out thinking okay I just need to<br>start this process and as as quick as I<br>can get it done I can retire<br>guess what it didn't happen it didn't<br>happen because what was happening<br>this is where I graduated these are the<br>dental caries rates in in 12 year olds<br>and this is in six-year-olds they were<br>coming down from the 1970s where dental<br>decay was endemic and everybody it was<br>it was out of control we saw a massive<br>and steep decline in disease rates and<br>those of us in the room who are old<br>enough to remember this will will know<br>that this was put down largely to to<br>fluoride and and if this trend continued<br>down that's we would have nothing to do<br>clinically fantastic unfortunately<br>though things started to kick up again<br>soon after I graduated and I I hope it's<br>nothing to do with the way I was<br>providing clinical care<br>but this is the trend and and the scary<br>thing is that we started to see in fact<br>it start to kick up again and Carries or<br>dental decay rates were going back up<br>and the other thing that we were unaware<br>of at the time but we know now is that<br>the disease that did exist in the<br>population was polarizing it was<br>locating itself in fewer and fewer<br>people so the better off in our<br>community we're getting lower rates of<br>dental decay but the people who are wet<br>Less well-off in our community<br>and you can see here these these are the<br>most deprived of these black bars were<br>experiencing most of the disease so this<br>was again an alarming indication that<br>things weren't going well in terms of<br>how we were managing dental disease<br>so we see we see these this inequality<br>developing people who are worst off in<br>terms of money resources and social<br>position<br>were worse off in terms of how much<br>Decay they got<br>and this the lights on it's not really<br>clear to see but this is what I was<br>seeing in very young children so you can<br>see most of the enamel on these teeth<br>have disappeared this is called Early<br>Childhood caries or early childhood<br>dental decay and I became very<br>interested in this here's another<br>picture of the child's mouth and you can<br>see that as well as those front teeth<br>which were decayed the molar teeth here<br>are also severely decayed interesting<br>thing about this kid<br>is here are the<br>two-year-old molars they're just coming<br>into the mouth so this child is about 18<br>months old and you can see from that<br>previous View most of the front teeth<br>were destroyed and the molars were not<br>far behind this is at 18 months so this<br>was really concerning for us to see you<br>know I thought long and hard about why<br>this was happening when things were<br>going so well the trends were so<br>positive why is this happening and it<br>turns out part of it might be the<br>commercial determinants of Health the<br>way food and sweetened sugared beverages<br>were being marketed produced and on a<br>global scale sold to our community so as<br>well as the biological determinants of<br>dental disease that I was taught at<br>school there were now this this emerging<br>commercial determinants of Health<br>and and what do these look like they<br>look like things like this bottom row<br>here so these foods that are so common<br>so prevalent now in children's diets<br>didn't exist<br>prior to the 1970s or didn't exist so<br>much<br>you know this is this is what meat used<br>to look like in our diet this is what it<br>looks like now this isn't actually food<br>anymore it's been processed so much and<br>had so much sugar fat uh and other<br>things added to it that it's um it's<br>it's no longer it doesn't resemble<br>this any longer and this is I think what<br>explains some of the the um<br>The Tick up that we saw soft drinks or<br>sweetened beverages are the other things<br>that there's massive consumption in<br>young people now in fact uh in in some<br>families and some groups you find that<br>the the consumption of sugar sweetened<br>beverages is greater than the level of<br>water that they're consuming so so very<br>concerning so this this is these are the<br>new forces that are that are out there<br>in the environments that are impacting<br>our General Health but also our oral<br>health this is a picture of a town I did<br>some work in kolac if anyone's been to<br>Victoria and Australia's beautiful<br>gorgeous place this is one of the towns<br>we did a lot of work in with young<br>families<br>and I think this encompasses this whole<br>commercial determinants of Health but<br>it's quite ironic so we've got the<br>medical practice here in this small town<br>I'm right next door we've got the<br>entrance to the takeaway for Kentucky<br>Fried Chicken<br>so this is sort of the circle this<br>revolving sort of process people get in<br>they can drive for a McDonald's or um<br>Kentucky Fried Chicken they can become<br>obese they can rot their teeth and then<br>they cycle into the medical practice uh<br>for uh you know their Cardiac Care<br>and this this is really a metaphor to<br>where we are currently in our society<br>unfortunately<br>but coming back to my title which is the<br>what happened to my mouth<br>part of the problem I think we have is<br>that we have this metaphorical<br>and conceptual removal of the mouth from<br>the rest of our body everyone here's got<br>a mouth right and we're not pretending<br>that they're people walking around with<br>no mouth<br>but what we have done conceptually<br>commercially professionally has taken<br>this mouth away from the rest of the<br>body the way we think about health and<br>well-being and we've compartmentalized<br>it and it's not just Dentistry that's<br>done it ears have done it too so have<br>eyes and and someone told me the other<br>day so feet<br>I wasn't quite I don't know much about<br>feet in the profession of foot care but<br>this is the way our health system has<br>has evolved so Dentistry is is an oral<br>health is not<br>but I want to take us back to the mouth<br>because that's where I'm starting okay<br>so what does the mouth mean to us<br>because this is really essentially<br>important I think for working out how we<br>how the mouth got out of our body<br>we think of the mouth in different ways<br>and you know I used to say to students<br>when I was a clinical instructor you you<br>see what you're looking for you see you<br>only see what you're looking for<br>and when they started to see new so<br>first year students they saw nothing<br>they knew nothing about the mouth they<br>knew there were teeth in there but they<br>couldn't spot disease they couldn't spot<br>other early early signs uh that all<br>older people like me could see but<br>neither could the patient so you only<br>see what you've been taught to see what<br>the dental and oral Health Professions<br>see when we look in someone's mouth is<br>very different from what people who<br>aren't oral and dental health<br>professionals see this is what we normal<br>people<br>see<br>okay<br>this is what doctors see medical doctors<br>they don't look at the teeth they tell<br>me they look past the teeth and they<br>look into the back of the mouth they<br>look at the tongue sometimes but they<br>don't look at the gums much and they<br>don't look at teeth they look past it so<br>they don't see the same things that we<br>see but they also see some other weird<br>things back here that some of us may not<br>recognize or see either<br>this is what dentists see or oral health<br>professionals see this has anyone had<br>this put on their mouth<br>this is rubber Dam and this is what I<br>used to teach students to do and I<br>taught them it because it made sense to<br>do this<br>for all sorts of reasons for keeping the<br>back of the mouth safe from bits and<br>pieces falling in it also meant that the<br>quality of the Restorations or fillings<br>we could do was better because we could<br>keep the tooth dry and with new<br>materials white tooth colored materials<br>they're really sensitive to moisture so<br>doing this actually we we are trying to<br>achieve an excellent outcome for our<br>individual patients<br>and again this is a metaphor as well<br>because what we're doing is isolating<br>that tooth<br>um<br>and we can get both our hands into<br>someone's mouth and we can do tiny<br>little things within a quarter of a<br>millimeter of precision and it's it's<br>really it's a very small space so it<br>helps us to be able to do that well but<br>what it does mean is that we don't see<br>or we lose sight of what's connected to<br>here's a slide that I showed Health and<br>Social care students when I wanted them<br>to think about what oral health means to<br>people and what I did here was put in a<br>couple of slides that I'd found of<br>different types of mouth and I said to<br>the Health and Social care students<br>which is which one of these mouths<br>is healthy would you say was healthy<br>and that what they said can you guess<br>this one<br>and this one was third not so good but<br>it was third<br>these three were awful<br>and the really sad thing for me was this<br>this is my mouth here it was awful they<br>did and and I said well which one would<br>you like and again it was the same ones<br>they didn't want this one but you know I<br>think I don't know maybe I need to go<br>and see someone but I think I've got<br>fairly good oral health uh this one uh<br>is is actually artificial these are<br>veneers or something artificial these<br>are dentures and these are teeth that<br>have been uh bleached or whitened so<br>none of these mouths are natural<br>so-called natural teeth and yet this was<br>the impression of healthy mouths and you<br>can see in the social media all around<br>us it's about white really straight and<br>sometimes the white is actually whiter<br>than natural shade of enamel would ever<br>be it's almost blue isn't it sometimes<br>what people do to their teeth with home<br>bleaching kits<br>so you know how we think about oral<br>health the way our math looks is really<br>important what does it mean to us and<br>the way we collectively think about that<br>influences What dental service looks<br>like or could look like it limits<br>sometimes what it could be this is<br>healthy<br>I hope this person is extremely healthy<br>they're not they're missing lots of<br>teeth but they're happy they're content<br>and they can do whatever they want to in<br>life<br>this person is very healthy although<br>there's a partial denture in a clasp and<br>you know the teeth aren't straight but<br>this person is happy they're healthy so<br>you know it's it's this way we think<br>about the mouth<br>and various<br>um organizations have attempted to say<br>what is oral health because this is<br>important as well the who says things<br>like essential functions such as eating<br>breathing speaking and also these<br>psychosocial Dimensions such as<br>self-confidence the way we feel about<br>ourselves the way we're able to<br>socialize with other people without<br>embarrassment without you know their<br>what oral health is they go on the World<br>Health Organization goes on to further<br>say oral health changes over life so it<br>means different things at different<br>stages of life if I was younger and on<br>the market socially for a partner maybe<br>I would have my teeth bleached and you<br>know straightened I don't know maybe<br>uh but at this stage in my life I'm<br>content with the way my teeth look even<br>though Health and Social care students<br>May criticize me but here's I also<br>really like this it's also about<br>into integration with oral health<br>with General Health sorry oral health<br>is important for General Health in fact<br>we can't have General Health if we don't<br>have oral health<br>and it's also about participating and<br>achieving people's potential so I really<br>like this expansive<br>definition of oral health<br>the<br>World Dental Federation so this is the<br>International<br>Association of of dental professionals<br>also talk about similar things so you<br>know smiling smelling speaking to that<br>functional thing the emotions so that<br>psychosocial elements it's really quite<br>important and they also talk about<br>freedom from Pain and discomfort of<br>disease<br>of of the the head uh and and face<br>but it's a much more limited scope<br>because this is the association of<br>dentists<br>if we connect back with our with General<br>Health we get this more expansive<br>definition so that's why I like it uh a<br>lot<br>but it has been criticized as difficult<br>to achieve how do we achieve all of<br>those things and certainly how does a<br>dentist or an oral health therapist or a<br>hygienist achieve all of those things<br>potential integration with General<br>Health<br>you know it's hard when we've only been<br>given a toolkit of clinical Dentistry to<br>work with we need to be a bit easier on<br>ourselves as Dental professionals you<br>know sometimes we feel guilt and blame<br>because we don't achieve what we want to<br>in terms of someone's potential in their<br>oral health<br>so we need to you know feel be a little<br>bit generous in the way we think about<br>what we do however the important thing<br>to remember is that oral diseases have<br>an impact on all of these parts of<br>people's lives and experiences<br>it influences things like whether<br>someone can participate or be socially<br>isolated there's some really interesting<br>work from my colleague Tim Newton and at<br>guys and kings in London where he's<br>demonstrated through a series of works<br>that manky looking teeth or teeth that<br>don't look great impact someone's<br>ability to get a job<br>employment<br>impacts their ability to get a date<br>impact a person's under you know<br>thinking about whether this person's<br>intelligent or socially skilled or not<br>those sorts of judgments are made and<br>Tim Newton's experimental designs show<br>that people will make those judgments<br>based on the way someone's teeth and<br>mouth look it's really interesting isn't<br>it<br>and it gives more weight to this idea<br>that oral health is more than just<br>prevention of pain and filling holes<br>good oral health impacts people's<br>well-being and life chances<br>it's really important<br>so let's take a trip through Dentistry<br>where did Dentistry begin well lots of<br>textbooks say it was in 1728 when Pierre<br>fouchard created this name the dentist<br>so that's where it began dentistry and<br>dentists apparently<br>of course people have had teeth before<br>1728 and people have been doing things<br>to their teeth into each other's teeth<br>to help them with problems but this is<br>when this term first started being used<br>these does anyone recognize these These<br>are Waterloo Dentures the so-called<br>Waterloo dentures and this was the state<br>of technology in in dental technology in<br>1728 these are in fact human teeth that<br>have been extracted from<br>uh cadavers or the war dead and then<br>mounted in Ivory and other other<br>materials and then used as dentures<br>this was the state of the art at that<br>time<br>this is what it looks like now so it's<br>all we're not we're not grave digging<br>and stealing people's teeth from bodies<br>and putting them in the interesting<br>thing was the first implants were being<br>done here too where dentists were<br>attempting to implant teeth that have<br>been extracted from bodies into live<br>bodies wasn't terribly successful but it<br>was the first first go at doing it<br>this is what Dentistry looks like now so<br>it's all whiz bang clean there are no<br>and it's a huge massive Market Dentistry<br>at the moment<br>um here we've got some astronomical<br>figures the global dental service Market<br>was<br>359 billion US dollars in 2021<br>in the UK<br>8.3 billion is spent<br>in a year on Dentistry<br>um for more than half of it came out of<br>people's pockets directly for private<br>care and the rest was covered by the NHS<br>so it's a huge Market lots of money is<br>being spent on trying to achieve oral<br>health<br>so given that that advance in technology<br>has occurred and the vast amount of<br>money that's spent on dentistry and oral<br>health services how are we doing in<br>terms of outcomes I just want to skip<br>you through and I hope this is not too<br>depressing because it's not meant to be<br>this is meant to be<br>an opportunity to think about how we<br>move things forward<br>okay so here's some scorecards from<br>public health England a quarter of uh<br>five-year-olds have tooth decay and this<br>is cavities uh three on average three to<br>four teeth affected per child who has<br>cavities<br>um the other thing that's interesting is<br>most of the cavities in young children<br>are untreated they're open active<br>lesions<br>and the other thing is with young<br>children and I know this because that's<br>where I used to work it's very difficult<br>to treat very young children with<br>extensive restoration of their think<br>about your own experience it's not<br>pleasant is it so for a very young child<br>it's also not great so a lot of money<br>time and pain is is expended in hospital<br>care for young children<br>we know that there is also a significant<br>impact on school hours Miss so kids<br>learning is impaired they miss school<br>their parents are distressed because<br>their children are in pain they don't<br>sleep well which is really important for<br>young children and parents also you lose<br>work both from the children's disease<br>but also from their own Dental Care<br>problems<br>um the cost of tooth extraction is quite<br>High because as I said children commonly<br>have this under a general anesthetic so<br>quite costly and uh in in this year here<br>50 million pounds were spent on<br>extraction of teeth of people under the<br>age of 19. I understand that this<br>includes wisdom teeth removal but it's<br>not the bulk of of that I might I might<br>not be correct there but I'm looking at<br>my dental colleagues in the room for<br>affirmation anyway there's a lot of most<br>of it is is not wisdom tooth removal or<br>um in terms of adults uh six million<br>adults in the UK have had long lasting<br>pain over two weeks caused by toothache<br>has anyone had a toothache has anyone<br>ever had a toothache<br>it's not good believe me it's not great<br>so to have that pain for two weeks is a<br>significant burden we're also seeing<br>other opportunity costs where people<br>have to pay to travel spend the time to<br>travel uh 40 miles 2 million adults have<br>had to travel more than 40 miles to get<br>dental care<br>and three and four adults have teeth<br>extracted<br>this is some American data because we<br>don't have similar data in the UK but<br>this was a survey of 15<br>000 patients by the American Dental<br>Association and here we're starting to<br>get into those social you know some of<br>those social things so here<br>um my life in general is less satisfying<br>because of my mouth and teeth and you<br>can see that<br>the low income uh the very often is much<br>higher than the high income so here<br>we're starting to see that social<br>gradient the impact of poor oral health<br>affects poorer people more than it does<br>better off people here we see 39 of<br>low-income adults say that they're less<br>satisfied with life interestingly 38 of<br>young people and this is what you know<br>well-off young people it's it's all<br>young people not just poor young people<br>isn't that interesting<br>and perhaps this reflects some of these<br>media some of the sense of what a good<br>mouth looks like what a healthy mouth<br>looks like that white straight thing<br>that we saw maybe that's feeding into<br>this dissatisfaction of younger people<br>with the way their mouth looks<br>I don't have any substantive<br>evidence for that but I just I I do<br>wonder whether that's something that's<br>feeding into it and here reasons for not<br>visiting a dentist this is really<br>interesting this is American data<br>remember so in the U.S most of dental<br>care is offered privately so you have to<br>pay out of your own pocket<br>but what we do find even in high income<br>people<br>this is the major reason for not<br>visiting a dentist is the cost even in<br>the most wealthy Americans the cost is<br>still cited as one of the most important<br>reasons not to go to the dentist<br>um just some more detail this is a<br>little sad I think I will accept I<br>accept I will lose some teeth with age<br>74 of young of sorry low income so poor<br>people accept that they will lose teeth<br>compared to their better off<br>citizens 48 so they're again a social<br>gradient with expectations about what<br>their oral health is going to be like I<br>think that's a bit sad too isn't it<br>hmm I'm poor I'm gonna lose my teeth<br>it's awful really<br>one in four Americans avoid smiling due<br>to the condition of their teeth 23 feel<br>embarrassment and one in five experience<br>anxiety because of the way their teeth<br>look<br>so significant psychosocial burden are<br>here as well<br>and here here's the here's the<br>um you know that that triangulation of<br>that data I talked about affecting job<br>opportunities<br>young people and poor people believe<br>that the appearance of their teeth does<br>actually affect their ability to<br>interview well so they're not going to<br>be confident in interviews potentially<br>let's come back to England though uh<br>this is the proportion of five-year-olds<br>with current active tooth decay by local<br>Authority so here we're starting to see<br>some geographical components to the<br>distribution of disease<br>and many people have probably heard<br>about the south north divide in terms of<br>socioeconomic stuff<br>well there's potentially the same<br>pattern with dental disease<br>this is five-year-olds where are we<br>we're here<br>so we're sort of in the middle here in<br>terms of the the pr the proportion of<br>children with tooth decay and not<br>surprisingly<br>it Maps against deprivation so the more<br>uh social deprivation we see<br>it Maps against the tooth decay of five<br>so so again it's reinforcing that idea<br>that social position determines disease<br>and also we'll look at later whether you<br>get care for the disease<br>and here I just put this in because this<br>makes me look really smart so the<br>scattergram<br>basically what it shows is the the port<br>the more deprived you are the the higher<br>sorry the rate of decay<br>it's it's a linear relationship and it's<br>consistently seen in all<br>um High income countries this pattern is<br>so<br>not great is it<br>one of the things I hear all the time<br>and my dental colleagues in the room<br>will also hear this is what are we going<br>to do about this what we need is more<br>Dental people we need more dentists we<br>need more oral health therapists<br>and that's probably true<br>however how many do we need<br>and how much is too much<br>let's explore this<br>here's some data from England this is<br>interesting at least I think it's<br>interesting<br>what we're seeing here<br>is the number of primary care NHS<br>dentists per 10 000 people in the<br>population these are the communities<br>that have the most dentists per 10 000<br>people and these are the areas in<br>England that have the lowest number of<br>dentists per 10 000.<br>I want you to keep an eye on Bradford<br>City do you know where Bradford is we<br>know the football club right<br>lesson the lesson now and Sid City<br>attached to the football club there's<br>Bradford<br>uh keep an eye on the south Tyne side we<br>know where that is I had to look that<br>one up because I'm I'm a migrant I<br>didn't know where that was and West<br>Norfolk and I know where this is because<br>I go there on holiday it's really lovely<br>okay so keep an eye on these<br>so this is the number of NHS dentists<br>per 10 000 people Bradford city is doing<br>real well West Norfolk<br>and South Lincolnshire are not doing in<br>North Lincolnshire hmm there you go<br>surprise okay here is dentist activity<br>as measured by this thing called<br>um Dental activity units of dental<br>activity and the dental people in the<br>room know this UDA and they all go oh<br>the UDA when they hear this but this is<br>how we measure Dental activity again<br>South tyneside and Bradford City the<br>most units of activity are delivered and<br>that sort of makes sense doesn't it<br>because they've got the most NHS<br>dentists right<br>good<br>nice linear relationship this is<br>statisticians in the room watching this<br>carefully this is there's nothing up my<br>sleeve<br>okay percentage of patients unsuccessful<br>when trying to get an NHS dental<br>appointment what's happened to Bradford<br>City<br>it's leapt across to the five bottom<br>why does Bradford city that has the most<br>NHS dentists per population so it's it<br>is a ratio right so we're we're<br>comparing eggs to eggs oranges to<br>oranges<br>why do they now have the most problem in<br>the last two years getting a an<br>appointment<br>there's lots of different reasons<br>there's private care that's distorting<br>what we're seeing here all sorts of<br>reasons but I guess the point I'm making<br>here is there is not a linear<br>relationship between the number of<br>dentists and oral health access and<br>outcomes it's not as simple as that as<br>saying we just need to put more dentists<br>here and the problem will be resolved<br>it's much more complex<br>that's my central thesis by the way<br>that's my central idea for tonight okay<br>so overall experience with NHS Dentistry<br>is actually very high right most people<br>are satisfied with it and that's great<br>but look Bradford City again down the<br>West Norfolk stays it's pretty constant<br>West Norfolk have you been keeping an<br>eye on that and something's going on<br>here in South China this is the place I<br>want to be South Ironside right<br>so again I just want to repeat that<br>there is not a linear relationship<br>between the number of dentists and the<br>outcomes that we would expect to see<br>and here's another interesting bit of<br>data<br>this is the percentage by course of<br>treatment by patient type over five<br>years so in so we've got three types of<br>patients here children who I understand<br>get free care am I right yep<br>non-paying adult who are those that get<br>Universal credits or on benefits and<br>don't have to pay the co-payment am I<br>correct yep and then we've got paying<br>adults that's the rest of us those of us<br>who have an income we have to pay a<br>co-payment which as an Australian I have<br>to say<br>Hazard is actually pretty modest cost<br>when compared to Australian prices but<br>let's just park that let's just park<br>that<br>uh<br>look but look what so look what's<br>happening over time and I want you to<br>keep an eye on this bar this orange bar<br>those people who have Universal Credit<br>and do not have to pay the co-payment<br>the the<br>that group<br>their access and receipt of dental<br>services is falling it's getting less<br>and less over time now why is this<br>happening when NHS Dentistry is<br>available for all citizens<br>and we've removed the barrier of the<br>co-payment why is it that those people<br>are accessing dental care less<br>significantly less over time for the<br>last five years<br>what is happening there<br>I have some ideas<br>but they're a little too controversial<br>tonight to tell you about<br>when I was a PhD student I went to<br>Cardiff so I've got this travel<br>scholarship and so I'm in Melbourne I'm<br>a PhD student I've got this travel<br>scholarship all this money to go<br>anywhere in the world I could possibly<br>get want to and I said to my supervisor<br>where am I going am I going to London<br>I'm going to New York or go to Paris no<br>you're going to Cardiff so I went to<br>Cardiff<br>and it was fantastic beautiful beautiful<br>place I absolutely loved it<br>but my the the project I had was why in<br>the presence of a universal free<br>dental service where young children only<br>going to see the dentist at the rate of<br>about 14<br>only 14 percent of children under the<br>age of five were going to the NHS<br>dentists<br>even when it was free<br>and universally available why was that<br>that was what I went to to understand<br>because it and and I still don't know<br>the answer to that question but I have<br>some very clear ideas about what that<br>might be<br>here's some Australian data just just to<br>reinforce that idea that just creating<br>more Dental professionals doesn't help<br>completely this is data in the state of<br>Victoria where I was something this is<br>data by one of my PhD students Prabhu<br>who's amazingly intelligent much more<br>intelligent this is a problem when you<br>when you get really smart students as<br>they make you look stupid this guy's<br>really brilliant but what what he did<br>was looked at we were looking at<br>refugees and their access and access<br>their their access and availability of<br>dental care services so refugees come<br>come from places which they've<br>experienced awful things and they have<br>terrible lots of uh terrible health<br>issues but dental health is one of those<br>things and the government in Victoria<br>made freely available and prioritized<br>for the first the next first appointment<br>was given to refugees to help them<br>access oral health services<br>so<br>but what we knew was they weren't going<br>they weren't going to this free<br>community clinics to receive oral health<br>services and we we wanted to understand<br>why that was<br>so what Prabhu did was to look at<br>um<br>the space the place where refugees were<br>located and where Dental Community<br>clinics were located<br>and to understand why maybe there's some<br>spatial thing maybe there was a mismatch<br>between where refugees were and where<br>the clinics were so that was the first<br>thesis so he looked at that using this<br>fancy GIS<br>software that Harriet knows about but<br>you know<br>most normal people couldn't couldn't<br>really understand but so what we see<br>here<br>is<br>um try so what we we also thought was<br>actually maybe transport and other<br>things have got to do with it so it's<br>not just about having a dental clinic<br>which is 10 miles away that that makes<br>it accessible to people it's how do<br>people get to that place and refugees<br>don't have much money by and large and<br>so ownership of cars was limited so we<br>looked at both how does the<br>using driving mode so he calculated what<br>would be a reasonable distance to drive<br>if you had a car and then he mapped out<br>where low accessibility was occurring<br>and not surprising it's up here in the<br>north west of the state which is north<br>which is pretty<br>um large but also remote so if if<br>refugees had a car and were able to<br>drive this is the level of accessibility<br>they would experience in these different<br>geographical places<br>so low<br>low accessibility it was difficult to<br>get to versus high<br>and we can see in the Melbourne<br>metropolitan area even though it was a<br>large city with lots of Roads it was<br>still difficult in some parts to drive<br>to uh to the local clinics<br>he also looked at public transport so if<br>you've got no car if you can't afford a<br>car you get the bus right<br>well that's if a bus exists and that's<br>if a bus actually turns up<br>so you can see here when when he mapped<br>against public transport modes the<br>accessibility just disappeared<br>and then what he did was look at the<br>oral health needs of refugees and he did<br>this in a very complicated way but he<br>mapped out then where the refugees were<br>in the state of Victoria and then what<br>their likely oral health needs were with<br>a high low medium Etc he mapped in the<br>same way oral health needs and then he<br>matched that to accessibility so the<br>next overlay we have are you keeping up<br>with me this took me a long time to<br>understand when he was explaining it to<br>me<br>so what he mapped here was low need High<br>accessibility right through to high need<br>low accessibility and the red spots are<br>where there are very high needs but no<br>access or availability of services<br>now what does this tell us apart from<br>these really cool maps with lots of<br>colors what it tells us is as we plan<br>oral health services where they should<br>be and who should be there we need to<br>take account of these geographical and<br>social issues because what we know from<br>history is that dentists generally like<br>to Cluster in large wealthy cities and<br>in Australia that is really quite<br>apparent<br>so most of the dentists and other oral<br>health professionals in the state of<br>Victoria live in Melbourne<br>and within Melbourne they cluster in the<br>richest suburbs of Melbourne where the<br>disease is lowest<br>so you think well what are they doing<br>there<br>they're not in the rural areas and poor<br>Fringe areas around Metropolitan<br>Melbourne where things are much higher<br>so problematic so<br>again my central thesis is it's much<br>more complex than just creating more<br>Dental professionals<br>let's come back to where Dentistry has<br>got to this is what it looked like in<br>the 1950s does anyone remember this<br>machine these machines I do and I you<br>know I sort of still think of myself as<br>young<br>this is what it looks like now<br>but really when you think about it<br>it's not much different is it the<br>machines are a bit fancier<br>there's better anesthetic and comfort<br>with the patient that's for sure<br>but really we're sort of doing the same<br>things we were doing in the 1950s which<br>is filling holes in teeth<br>and a colleague of mine at University<br>College London Richard watt who some of<br>you may have heard of published this<br>paper in the Lancet which was quite<br>critical of dentistry and where we are<br>at the moment and you can see from his<br>words that he's frustrated<br>that he is a dentist and and oral health<br>professionals are stuck in this model<br>that looks like this why are we stuck in<br>this model he he says we're trapped<br>we're trapped in this model because we<br>keep doing the things that we've always<br>done why couldn't Dentistry look like<br>this this is some work we did in that<br>you know the place with the Kentucky<br>Fried Chicken and the medical center<br>this is that place we're offering dental<br>care in someone's home this is a young<br>child receiving care in a laptop what we<br>call the lap to lap this was done in a a<br>home this is another person's home where<br>the child was receiving care this is<br>outside that traditional model of<br>Dentistry which which is a surgery where<br>we surround ourselves with the machines<br>that make us feel comfortable<br>here's another child receiving care I<br>think this is this isn't someone's home<br>you can tell by the tablecloth<br>and here's a very young mother and you<br>can see she's young because she's still<br>got the card saying congratulations on<br>the birth of your baby<br>and we're doing work here early in life<br>these are alternative models<br>but we don't invest much in them and we<br>don't really want to do them because<br>this is actually not as comfortable for<br>us to sit in this way<br>but it really suits potentially the<br>family<br>and here's the other thing remember I<br>talked about the food and the commercial<br>determinants of Health we really need to<br>understand this and I know the dental<br>professionals around us do understand<br>this but it's about how do we articulate<br>this in the British Dental Journal<br>Dental Care is an obesity must be<br>tackled together we cannot separate<br>those things out and do one thing over<br>here and one thing over here because<br>they're connected they're connected to<br>those commercial determinants of Health<br>diabetes people who have uncontrolled<br>gum disease will have worse control of<br>their blood sugar<br>and worse diabetic outcomes we know that<br>the the evidence is absolutely well I<br>won't say absolutely<br>um 100 because there's always doubt but<br>it's very very strong now we know that<br>if we treat periodontal diseases and<br>treat them well we'll increase<br>their vascular health<br>there's a huge cost people have done<br>modeling to show if we did this we<br>reduced periodontal or gum diseases we'd<br>save massive amounts of money in<br>Diabetes Care and yet we're not<br>connected up dentists aren't talking<br>about diabetes and doctors are even<br>worse they don't talk about looking in<br>people's mouths and talking about gum<br>disease<br>but we sort of know this stuff already<br>and this is this is from the 1990s this<br>stuff which connects up all of these<br>common risk factors and yet we all<br>operate in these silos<br>so you can see here that tooth decay<br>shares common risk factors with so one<br>of the things I want to propose as a Way<br>Forward is integrating oral health into<br>General Health dental medical Behavioral<br>Health Pharmacy social support services<br>all embracing oral health but equally as<br>this slide suggests Dental Health has to<br>embrace Behavioral Health and Pharmacy<br>it can't be a one-way Direction and when<br>we say to Doctors medical doctors you<br>need to do more in oral health<br>they say well what you know what are you<br>doing in obesity and it's a fair comment<br>isn't it so so this integration is about<br>taking the mouth back into the body and<br>this this is this is um a care home uh<br>where there's been there's some moral<br>Health stuff obviously going on there<br>but it's about thinking about how can we<br>do effective oral health outside the<br>dental surgery in an integrated fashion<br>and<br>we have a young PhD student in the room<br>Amanda I don't want to embarrass you but<br>talented young person who's who's doing<br>PhD study looking at how we can<br>integrate oral health into General<br>Health Care but there are various models<br>and again I'm just presenting this model<br>because it shows the complexity the<br>different levels that we need to operate<br>at policy as well as clinical practice<br>we need to think about organizational<br>integration and systems of reimbursement<br>or reward because unless we we do<br>something with the rewards the money we<br>won't get changes in clinical practice<br>because rewards determine Behavior<br>if we get money for this we do that if<br>we don't get money for that we don't do<br>it that's the way the world works so<br>it's got to be occurring at all of these<br>different levels<br>and that really<br>um sits well with this understanding of<br>these multiple determinants of Health<br>it's not just about the biology or the<br>bugs in our mouth it's about where we<br>live it's about what we eat it's about<br>how uh the structures around us the<br>roads all sorts of things influence our<br>health some smart people smarter people<br>than me have done a review of what what<br>would it take to get oral health into<br>General primary care more effectively<br>some of the barriers they came up with<br>this one low political will to do it<br>funding systems that actually discourage<br>people working together that's not good<br>right but we continue to do it and it's<br>expedient expeditious<br>for politicians to do that<br>so a lot of the decisions in health care<br>funding and a lack of integration are<br>based on political needs<br>and that's problematic<br>but we also have our disciplines nurses<br>saying I don't do dental stuff the<br>dentist has to do that and if they don't<br>do it I will blame the dentist rather<br>than what can I do in oral health to<br>support my patients when they're in my<br>care but there's also lots of good good<br>facilitators or things that can make<br>this happen and one of the things that<br>I'm very keen to move forward here at<br>the University of Lincoln Provost<br>Chancellor<br>Provost Chancellor number two is to move<br>forward integration of oral health into<br>all Health and Social care disciplines<br>so it sits in there but also to look at<br>how oral health can Embrace those<br>disciplines in return we need to work<br>together<br>and<br>we need to also encourage local<br>Champions so members of the public who<br>are going to work together with the<br>system to ensure that we get change<br>and here's an example of how we did that<br>in Australia these are migrant and<br>Refugee mothers and grandmothers so we<br>mobilized in in Melbourne a group of<br>mothers and grandmothers who were<br>refugees and migrants communities to<br>support the health of their children and<br>so we asked them what oral health meant<br>to them and what what they felt we could<br>do to improve the oral health of<br>themselves and also their communities<br>and the ideas that they came up with<br>were really amazing really amazing and<br>things that would never have occurred to<br>us as Dental professionals or<br>researchers I just want to tell you<br>about one project we did with rural<br>communities because I'm sort of now I'm<br>a professor of rural Health I've got to<br>talk about rural stuff as well this is a<br>project we did was funded by the nhmrc<br>which is the sort of big fun Health<br>funding thing in Australia and what we<br>did was we used a what's called<br>participatory methods so it's<br>deliberately involving<br>regular people in talking about the<br>issues around oral health and what those<br>Solutions might be now the context for<br>this was in rural Victoria there were<br>many communities that had no dental<br>services and they were unlikely to get<br>any in the short term<br>so we went into these communities and<br>used and the communities were located in<br>Queensland so there were three<br>communities in the front in in the far<br>north and far north of Queensland there<br>are also some communities in Victoria<br>where where we were karang kaya from and<br>Swan Hill<br>uh and we spent time working with<br>regular people and introducing the ideas<br>of oral health so there were two stages<br>one was around brainstorming and<br>thinking about what the solutions could<br>be and the second stage was about<br>implementing the plans that communities<br>had come up with themselves<br>this part was really important because<br>we needed to carry through with what the<br>public was saying they wanted what they<br>wanted their plans to be and they also<br>had an obligation to help us do that if<br>they had told us this is what we want<br>right<br>so it makes a lot of sense<br>so we had workshops in each of these<br>communities and we talked about what the<br>community's aspirations were for their<br>oral health and their communities oral<br>health we introduced information that we<br>knew about from the research literature<br>and we put it into language that normal<br>people would understand and we said this<br>is what we know Works in other places<br>here and then we worked together with<br>the community to say well these are the<br>problems this is what we understand<br>works this is what we would like to do<br>knowing those things rather than the top<br>down which is this is what we as health<br>professionals think you need<br>and what we what they came up with was<br>amazing they did absolutely amazing<br>stuff and the Continuum of things that<br>happened in these communities was from<br>very simple stuff like<br>having oral health awareness activities<br>when children were bought in for their<br>their immunizations early in life<br>because they happened multiple times<br>that was a real easy thing to do and<br>here was this was this is a real real<br>surprise for us<br>I don't know what the feeling is in this<br>community about water fluidation but in<br>Australia there was a massive debate<br>about whether water fluoridation is a<br>good thing or whether it's poisoning the<br>community<br>all right so what we had in Victoria was<br>uh communities that weren't fluoridated<br>but whenever someone said should we<br>fluoridate your community there'd be<br>this massive sort of<br>social media and and media<br>um uproar and people go oh no it's too<br>scary and dentists and others were too<br>scared to talk about fluoridation<br>because this happened but what we had<br>was one chiabrum<br>uh Community actually decided after<br>talking to us about water fluoridation<br>is one of the possible things they<br>actually went to the government and said<br>the community of kyabram led by the the<br>council went to the state government and<br>said we want water fluoridation I had a<br>call from the health Minister's office<br>saying what the hell have you been doing<br>in kyabram mark because we have never<br>ever had a community approach us asking<br>for water fluoridation usually they're<br>banging on the door saying we don't want<br>your poison in our town now whether you<br>agree with water fluoridation or not<br>that was a spectacular outcome I think<br>of this community engagement and<br>participatory methods so I'm going to<br>end here but I want to just<br>summarize by saying what we think might<br>be the solution which is the simple way<br>of thinking more dentists more Dental<br>professionals more Dental Services might<br>not be the full picture it's important<br>because we need to deal with the disease<br>when it happens but what is also<br>important is to think about not just an<br>effective and Equitable Dental Care<br>System<br>but we need to think about oral health<br>integrated into primary care so that<br>oral health happens everywhere a person<br>or patient has contact with the system<br>it has to happen in Social care as well<br>as primary care that's really super<br>important and then lastly we need this<br>community<br>effective Community engagement and<br>participation in decision making around<br>what oral health services look like and<br>what we spend their money on in terms of<br>oral health<br>I think if you this is my dream if we<br>can effectively create these three<br>pillars we will have a very sound Shield<br>over the population in terms of oral<br>health so I'm going to stop now because<br>I think I've actually over done the<br>talking so thank you for your<br>attention tonight and I hope that's been<br>useful and maybe a little bit</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
