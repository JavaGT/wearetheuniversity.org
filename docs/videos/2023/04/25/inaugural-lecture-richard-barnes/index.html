accurate.</p><p>um let me Begin by saying a huge thank<br>you for turning out to hear my lecture<br>this evening it's cold outside it's<br>getting near Christmas and the country's<br>in a bit of a state so actually of you<br>taking time out to come and listen to my<br>lecture is really warming and I do<br>appreciate it so<br>let's hope it's worth it<br>okay<br>I posed this title because I thought it<br>was quite interesting who owns the sea<br>and why does it matter now having posed<br>this question or set of questions I'm<br>now going to add a caveat and the caveat<br>is that I'm not going to answer the<br>question that I've paused because as an<br>academic I never let a little bit of<br>nuance stand in the way of a good title<br>a good set of headlines here<br>more seriously though<br>um the reason why I'm not going to<br>answer this question is probably because<br>we just simply don't have the data we<br>don't have the evidence to actually know<br>who owns the sea if we think about the<br>oceans they cover 70 of the planet it's<br>a massive space we've got the water<br>column we've got the seabed we've got<br>the subsoil underneath it we've got<br>Fisheries we've got shipping we've got<br>minerals we've got renewable energy<br>we've got a 198 or so countries some of<br>them landlocked all vying for control of<br>space in addition to all the companies<br>and individuals who conduct activities<br>at Sea it'll be a massive undertaking to<br>actually work this out and even if I<br>could do that it would probably be a<br>tedious lecture going X Y and Z owns X Y<br>and Z so what I wanted to do instead was<br>to think a little bit more widely about<br>how ownership and control come about and<br>the role that law play days and the<br>process of constructing the oceans<br>constructing ownership and to think a<br>little bit about what that tells us as a<br>society and some of the challenges and<br>the problems that it presents to us and<br>this is important because I think if you<br>read the newspapers if you look at any<br>specialist articles magazines the<br>research and the information out there<br>tells us that the oceans are in a pretty<br>poor State we're overfishing them we're<br>dumping a waste in them they're being<br>flooded with plastics so what we're<br>doing at the moment doesn't really seem<br>to be working so it's important for us<br>to understand a little bit about<br>how things work and maybe why the aren't<br>working<br>so my lecture is going to take us<br>through some of these things and at the<br>end I'll try and finish on a slightly<br>more positive note and think about maybe<br>what we can do going forward to try and<br>change that State of Affairs<br>anyway so that's what I plan to do the<br>reality might be something slightly<br>different time permitting so<br>um a bit like a play a narrative I've<br>got a lecture in four parts here so on<br>the first part of this I'm going to set<br>the scene talk a little bit about the<br>oceans but more specifically the values<br>that we attach to them and the reason<br>why I'm starting there is because as a<br>lawyer I love the law and I want to<br>understand how it works but I also<br>appreciate that law is instrumental it's<br>often there to achieve other social<br>economic and political ends so if you<br>want to know what the law is doing and<br>if it's doing it well we need to know<br>what the purpose of the law is so the<br>first part of my lecture will talk a<br>little bit about that<br>then in the second part of my lecture<br>I'm going to talk about lines and<br>legalities the oceans are different a<br>common theme meme within my lecture is<br>to explore the difference between the<br>oceans and land territory because law<br>Works differently at sea<br>and the point I probably want to<br>emphasize there is that when we start<br>thinking about how law enables control<br>over the oceans it does it differently<br>Often by drawing lines<br>but also when we think about how law<br>operates there is a greater degree of<br>pressure on law to deliver because there<br>are other mechanisms for ensuring<br>control aren't working so strongly so<br>the law has to be very legitimate and it<br>also has to be very effective in terms<br>of attracting compliance<br>then time permitting I'm going to get on<br>to say something about ownership because<br>I did say I was going to talk about who<br>owns the oceans but in this section I'm<br>not really going to be talking about the<br>Whos and the whys I'm going to be<br>thinking a little bit more deeply about<br>what justifies ownership and now I'll go<br>back and have a look at some theories<br>and concepts of ownership and the<br>justifications of that and show how they<br>might apply to the Seas and then<br>wrapping it all up together I'll then<br>provide some options for the future are<br>you with me<br>wow that's good okay<br>um<br>part one what do we value and um what<br>value do we place on the ocean so as I<br>said laws instrumental and so we need to<br>think about the values that we place<br>upon the oceans any good lecture always<br>starts with some facts and figures and<br>it says something about how important<br>the topic is you've got to justify what<br>you're speaking about so let's start<br>with some<br>economics or some data here<br>in 2012 the real plus 20 conference<br>developed this notion of the blue<br>economy and the idea of the blue economy<br>is that if the oceans are in a healthy a<br>good condition then we can exploit them<br>for better value<br>it was also about developing<br>potential of the oceans<br>in order to sustain<br>some of the societies some of the needs<br>some of the development needs that we<br>have around the world so the idea was<br>that we're kind of maximizing<br>exploitation of land so let's turn right<br>to the oceans and see if we can develop<br>them further to help improve our ability<br>to go forward as a society<br>and in doing so this generated quite a<br>lot of interest about the blue economy<br>but it started really with the idea of<br>trying to Value what the oceans are<br>worth if we're going to develop a blue<br>economy we need to know what the value<br>of that economy is going to be so the<br>oecd for example has valued the current<br>oceans as producing each year 1.5<br>trillion dollars worth of value and this<br>is expected to double by 2030. currently<br>ocean capital is somewhere in the region<br>of about 24 trillion dollars so to come<br>back to my initial question why does it<br>matter well if we know who owns the<br>oceans we know who owns a slice of that<br>great big pie up there<br>so I guess it's important that we<br>understand ownership<br>but the problem I have when I start with<br>things like economic value and dollar<br>values is that it starts to portray the<br>oceans as a commodity and the oceans<br>aren't just a commodity they are<br>valuable but they are something more<br>than that<br>also if we start to portray the oceans<br>purely in terms of Commodities it starts<br>to perpetuate the idea that the oceans<br>are only there to be exploited and this<br>isn't the only set of values which I<br>think can and should inform the way we<br>view the oceans<br>so let's look a little bit more widely<br>okay so as I said here part of the<br>problem is that when we view the oceans<br>in dollar terms we tend to commodify the<br>oceans and what that will do is it will<br>push us to try and exploit more of that<br>resource so on the left hand slide of<br>the slide here I've just got an image of<br>the Dutch Maritime Zone and what this<br>map shows here is the kind of scale and<br>range of different activities dredging<br>offshore wind energy generation the<br>submarine protected areas in there there<br>are fishing grounds there are dumping<br>zones there are sites for military<br>activities to take place<br>the Netherlands is a pretty small<br>country but you can already see how<br>intensive ocean use is and that raises<br>the question as to whether or not<br>actually valuing the oceans and<br>producing them as a commodity is the<br>best way forward is it risking things<br>collapsing<br>there are other<br>Valley oceans so let's have a look a<br>little bit at literature I like things<br>I'm mixing things up here Dominic you<br>still with me good excellent okay so<br>other values which attach to them<br>painting by Turner the fighting temerar<br>here um it pictures Battleship which is<br>just finished a conflict at Sea I think<br>it's kind of interesting here it makes<br>the point for me the oceans through<br>history have been a contested space<br>sometimes for war but perhaps more often<br>than not for other values the oceans are<br>a barrier between States but they're<br>also a bridge between States they're a<br>site where States move into and they<br>project their values they try and<br>present them against other states and we<br>can have dialogue and we can have<br>practice between states about what is<br>important about the ocean and how we use<br>it so it's a site of Interstate<br>interactions so when we think about<br>international law it's that process of<br>interaction which can sometimes create<br>value and create ideas but of course<br>that's only interactions by States I'm<br>not sure about the rest of us<br>so some other values here we've got the<br>Great Wave<br>um I really like this one because what<br>it says is that basic the oceans are<br>powerful they're beyond our control<br>we've got a tiny fishing vessel at risk<br>of capsizing there so in terms of how we<br>value we perceive the oceans we often<br>see them as being a space outside of<br>States but also beyond our control<br>somewhere we would like to exert control<br>somewhere we'd like to civilize but<br>sometimes beyond our ability to control<br>another example<br>everybody's familiar but probably hasn't<br>read the rhyme of the Ancient Mariner<br>here a classic of literature by<br>um Coleridge<br>um the memes are the ideas behind this<br>are that the oceans are sometimes an<br>unknown Space full of unexpected perils<br>here but also there's a lesson here when<br>the albatross is shot<br>it invites bad luck onto the vessel and<br>ultimately results in its doom and the<br>only Survivor here is then destined to a<br>life of telling everybody about the<br>perils that he's undertaken and how<br>warful his life is but it also speaks to<br>the idea that the oceans again or<br>outside of society and that they are<br>actually something which is infrequently<br>used or understood but also ones which<br>generate senses of loneliness and<br>Detachment so again we've got another<br>set of values which attach to this and<br>again another classic here Moby Dick and<br>the oceans are seen as a space a space<br>of Freedom a space where we can Quest a<br>space where there is opportunity to<br>explore and exploit but also the oceans<br>are a place where if we go and we pursue<br>our own self-interest our own ego then<br>we do so at our own Peril<br>um it tells us that if we are far too<br>reliant on ourselves then things are<br>likely to go wrong as Captain they have<br>found out here there's also some<br>interesting lessons about property in<br>Moby Dick so for example there's a nice<br>discourse on who actually is entitled to<br>own ship and fish and it's basically<br>first come first serve so kind of basic<br>Echoes of how property might be<br>constructed culturally when it happens<br>at Sea it's also got terrible undertones<br>of slavery as well I'm afraid so we've<br>got Pitt the cabin boy who is largely<br>disregarded and abused and he's<br>commodified as somebody who can be used<br>for the benefits of others and this<br>speaks to the idea that sometimes Beyond<br>States property works unfortunately in<br>in bad ways so we've got all these<br>different types of value which can be<br>sometimes used to help us understand the<br>oceans<br>another set of values which is coming in<br>more recently is the idea of Rights of<br>nature a lot of what I've said before is<br>about how we project our values onto the<br>oceans how we anthroper synthesize them<br>how we treat them as a commodity<br>increasingly there's a concern though<br>for the idea that nature is an equal<br>partner in society we don't view<br>ourselves as apart from it and this is<br>generating some interesting ideas about<br>how we value it and how we value our<br>interactions with the oceans now come<br>back to this later<br>so a couple of Key summary points here<br>oceans are spaces where many different<br>values interact and that's important<br>they're a site for Value creation<br>the oceans are a space which is<br>different to land when things happen at<br>Sea they happen differently and in part<br>that's due to the fluid the dynamic<br>nature of the oceans and the fact that<br>they are distant from many centers of<br>society<br>but there's also some questions here<br>about whose values Prevail I said a lot<br>about States and international law and<br>about how they project their values one<br>of the problems that we have perhaps in<br>terms of the construction of the oceans<br>how we design ocean regimes is the fact<br>that many important voices simply aren't<br>heard but I'll come back to that one<br>later<br>so that's the context sorry um that was<br>quite long so let's move on to some<br>thoughts about how lot interacts and how<br>lot advances some of these values<br>so in this part of the lecture I want to<br>talk a little bit about the construction<br>of ocean space the idea is that yes the<br>oceans are a space but the oceans<br>themselves aren't simply a space they're<br>a site where values interact and law has<br>an important role in creating and<br>establishing those values<br>so I'll begin with some lessons from<br>history just to show how some of that<br>has played out I'll then talk a little<br>bit about what this has resulted in and<br>come back to the question of who owns<br>the oceans and then I'll say something<br>briefly about the construction process<br>oops okay so going back in time history<br>um<br>one of the earliest legal regimes which<br>was developed for the oceans was<br>formulated in the Treaty of tordesius of<br>1494. this was an international<br>agreement between Spain and Portugal<br>there were two major Maritime powers<br>and basically what they decided between<br>them was to carve the world into two<br>parts they drew a line down the Meridian<br>of the ocean about 100 miles west of the<br>Azore Islands and basically everything<br>to the west of that was given to Spain<br>and everything to the east of that was<br>given over to Portugal<br>Spain and Portugal they were powerful<br>Catholic States and so this was endorsed<br>by the pool but a time when natural law<br>meant something<br>didn't matter that there were people<br>living in these different Societies or<br>these different parts of the world they<br>belonged to Spain and Portugal now<br>clearly the rest of Europe<br>wouldn't take that lying down and so<br>this generated quite an intense debate<br>about how to control the oceans and a<br>leading Advocate somebody who challenged<br>The Carving up of the oceans between<br>Spain and Portugal was the Dutch jurist<br>Hugo de grotius about 21 years old he<br>wrote a major manuscript on<br>international law he was advising States<br>and governments so it was a bit of a<br>go-getter for his time but what he did<br>was to challenge the idea that natural<br>law god-given law as dictated by the<br>pope and by Catholic States was<br>something which we have to take as a<br>given and he Advanced the idea of<br>freedom of the high seas the idea that<br>the Seas by their nature by human reason<br>were open to all states there were<br>common space<br>sounds great it sounds idealistic and to<br>an extent it was<br>but let's not forget though that Dutch<br>had employed Hugo de Groot of the East<br>Dutch East Indies had deployed him to<br>basically Advocate against the Spanish<br>and Portuguese claims because the Dutch<br>wanted a piece of the action and the<br>only way they could do this was by<br>basically maintaining free navigational<br>rights through what was claimed to be<br>owned by Spanish and Dutch Waters<br>he was challenged by somebody called<br>John Selden he was an English jurist and<br>he didn't like what um Grocers was<br>saying at the time England was an<br>emerging Maritime power and so he<br>advocated the notion of Mary klausum the<br>idea the Seas were closed that they<br>could be closed off by States and<br>exclusively used by them known as the<br>battle of the books this set the kind of<br>template for how the law of the sea<br>would develop here the idea of inclusive<br>and exclusive use of the oceans but what<br>we have is States basically projecting<br>their political their policy aims onto<br>the oceans and using that to carve them<br>up perhaps regardless of what other<br>values existed<br>so let's Zoom forward 400 or so years to<br>the present date and this is what the<br>oceans look like today when we draw<br>lines on a map we can see who owns what<br>well in rough terms but basically all<br>states at least those with a coastline<br>are entitled to claim Maritime zones a<br>12-mile territorial sea within which<br>they've got exclusive control subject to<br>limited rights of navigation and beyond<br>that stretching up to 200 nautical miles<br>an exclusive economic zone where they<br>have Sovereign rights for the purpose of<br>exploring and exploiting natural<br>resources basically they get anything of<br>value which is in the coastal Waters<br>next to the Sea and if that's not enough<br>we also have the continental shelf the<br>sea bed and subsoil beneath the Seas<br>which can sometimes extend out to around<br>about 350 nautical miles what this means<br>is that around about 142 States control<br>around about 50 of the oceans and the<br>bit that's left in the middle is the<br>high seas and that's left forever<br>everybody to use in common<br>but we have the carving up of the oceans<br>so I suppose to come back to my original<br>point then it states who own or control<br>the oceans but it's not just State<br>owning or controlling the oceans equally<br>as this little chart shows it's the top<br>ten of ocean owners as it were I could<br>show you the the remaining 142 but you<br>get an idea of who the major<br>beneficiaries of ocean control are so<br>right at the top we've got France not<br>the biggest state but by virtue of its<br>Colonial possessions its overseas<br>territories it generates a massive<br>Maritime entitlement again the UK number<br>five not quite Eurovision prospects but<br>still pretty high up on the charts there<br>again it's got a massive Maritime Zone<br>now this is important because when we<br>think about who controls or owns the<br>oceans it's not divided up on principles<br>of equity or fairness or need it's done<br>according to geography<br>your ability to claim Maritime space is<br>effectively generated by the size and<br>shape of your Coastline and if the<br>geographic dice have rolled favorably<br>then you get a great big chunk of the<br>oceans and if you're not if you're like<br>Germany where you're kind of tied in<br>between the Netherlands and Denmark you<br>get<br>a really small Maritime zone so<br>geography is critical<br>boss that suggests that geography is<br>somehow neutral in the process<br>why do we use geography well because<br>States decided to use geography<br>and obviously that benefited the top 10<br>Nations at least over time we've got<br>other claims to the oceans this is the<br>deep sea bed so we've got further<br>propertation or control exclusive<br>control of ocean space the Clarion<br>clipperton Zone here carved up between<br>about 10 11 states and private<br>Consortium and basically these are<br>claims to access the mineral resources<br>of the deep sea bed and these are seen<br>as increasingly vital for green energy<br>so it's Cobalts copper other rare<br>materials which we need for our Green<br>Technology that power our batteries our<br>phones and our cars again we have<br>significant claims by Leading states to<br>access these resources but this has<br>largely been done on a first come first<br>serve basis<br>and this is generally favored those<br>states with the technology to exploit<br>the deep sea bed so we're talking about<br>Western developed States we're not<br>talking about the poor economies around<br>the world<br>so coming back to this idea of geography<br>um<br>this is a little bit of law at least<br>everything else has been policy and<br>philosophy and ideas but we've got a<br>case here we've got the North Sea<br>continental shelf case of 1969 a seminal<br>legal case in international law which<br>set out how we delimit our Continental<br>shells how we carve up the seabed<br>adjacent to our coastlines and as part<br>of this decision it articulated the<br>concept that the land dominates the sea<br>so the idea here again is that territory<br>the power of states is projected onto<br>the sea and that justifies the maritime<br>claims and entitlements that we've got<br>of course<br>this is a little bit of a fiction though<br>the idea that the land does dominate the<br>sea<br>sea level rise<br>it reveals the limits of this approach<br>here we're all aware global warming is<br>causing sea levels to rise in some<br>countries this is merely eroding more<br>quickly coastlines but for some states<br>this is an existential threat<br>particularly if you're a small island<br>developing state in the Pacific where<br>you're largely based on recent atolls a<br>couple of inches can make your land<br>uninhabitable it can remove your access<br>to fresh water and if sea levels<br>continue to rise then ultimately it can<br>result in the loss of statehood<br>altogether<br>so geography is only useful so far but<br>what's interesting now is that many of<br>the states who are at threat from sea<br>level rise are turning to other<br>mechanisms for defining their claims<br>they're no longer saying that they're<br>our time entitlement will be determined<br>by their Coastline because their<br>Coastline will disappear they're<br>starting to fix points on maps which<br>will guarantee them control of ocean<br>space regardless of their territory<br>disappearing so again it shows how<br>certain policy drives can shape the way<br>in which we control or make claims over<br>ocean space and I'm not going to<br>complain about them doing that I'm not a<br>fan of geography and I think there are<br>important reasons to do this for Equity<br>why should they suffer because of<br>industrialization causing climate change<br>for which they haven't contributed to so<br>the idea that they should be able to<br>maintain these entitlements should be<br>driven by more Equitable concerns<br>now change of tax slightly so I've<br>talked a little bit about who owns<br>things but I want to say something very<br>briefly about the problems of<br>identifying ownership I want to say<br>something briefly about the kind of<br>hidden patterns of control so when I<br>talked a little bit about the idea that<br>in history certain States dictated set<br>the template for how the Seas develop<br>these ideas still continue to do but<br>they're not always apparent in the law<br>so we've got the idea that sometimes the<br>historical process creates ways of doing<br>things which aren't obvious to us now<br>and unless we see how that's happened we<br>don't sometimes understand how things<br>are going to happen in the future<br>in addition to those kind of<br>historical<br>challenges of corporate ownership and<br>structure and identifying actually even<br>within States who does own some of these<br>ocean spaces so we've got the recent<br>example here of narrow now narrow tiny<br>small island developing State about 11<br>000 people live in nauru but it's host<br>to Nori the narrow ocean<br>um<br>construction incorporation which is<br>basically a company which hosts one of<br>those claims to the deep sea bed however<br>Nori is actually owned or pretty much a<br>hold on subsidiary of something called<br>the metals company which is a Canadian<br>Corporation and it's the Canadian<br>corporation which has the technology the<br>resources to exploit the seabed and so<br>what we have here is a kind of<br>collaboration a joint venture between a<br>very weak State and a very powerful<br>mining cooperation<br>I'll ask you the question I won't answer<br>this one who do you think really owns<br>the claim which nauru is making to the<br>deep sea bed<br>interestingly in July last year Naru<br>invoked What's called the two-year rule<br>basically although we have claims to the<br>deep sea bed we don't have any rules<br>which govern these activities but in the<br>convention there is a rule which governs<br>this there's a rule which states that<br>states can't invoke the two-year rule<br>which basically means that unless the<br>international seabed Authority which<br>sets out the rules for how mining takes<br>place gets its act together and develops<br>rules for mining then if it doesn't do<br>so within two years it will have to then<br>start considering mining license<br>applications and to do so on the basis<br>of any information that it has but also<br>with a presumption it that it will grant<br>those licenses so what we have here is a<br>strong corporate process which is<br>perhaps pushing the way in which we<br>exploit ocean resources in a potentially<br>harmful and hazardous Direction<br>another example of hidden ownership we<br>all love renewable energy and in the UK<br>renewable energy is basically at least<br>activity at Sea so companies will<br>approach the government and in<br>particular the crown Estates Commission<br>in order to obtain the rights to use the<br>seabed for putting in place offshore<br>wind farms this generates a huge amount<br>of Revenue around about 5 billion for<br>the UK but what's interesting is that<br>actually most of the sites which we've<br>now leased out in the North Sea are<br>actually state-owned corporations in<br>other countries so for example we've got<br>Dom energy from the nether from Denmark<br>has about 24 we've got Endura from<br>Norway which has about nine percent of<br>these spaces so even though the UK<br>claims exclusive control actually the<br>activities and the revenues from them<br>are perhaps going to foreign States<br>okay so I've talked a little bit about<br>the values at play I've talked a little<br>bit about how law has a role to play in<br>constructing those values and I've also<br>talked about some of the kind of<br>problems in terms of identifying when<br>law grants rights actually are they<br>always granted to the people we think<br>they're granted and actually who enjoys<br>the benefits from these and if nothing<br>else<br>it's painting a picture that things<br>aren't always that straightforward<br>so<br>let's turn now to property<br>let's think about<br>how rules on property how ideas of<br>property can also play a role in<br>determining who can access and use the<br>oceans resources<br>right here's where I'm probably going to<br>trip myself up because I'm going to talk<br>about something a little bit<br>sophisticated and I'm not sure entirely<br>understand it myself and this is because<br>it's interdisciplinary research so I'm<br>going to talk about the idea of<br>constructing ocean space in law<br>we like a simplistic life we like<br>statutes we like cases we interpret them<br>we apply them but in other disciplines<br>they have a little bit more focus on<br>Theory and construction sorry to the law<br>school there I know that's not true but<br>I'm just trying to win some favors here<br>easily okay so the construction of ocean<br>space so the idea is that space is not<br>just simply a fact it's not just simply<br>an object which has things done to it<br>that actually space is something which<br>is constructed through the interaction<br>of natural or material processes and<br>social processes a really simple example<br>your house and your home<br>a house is an object it's a building<br>with a roof and windows and a door<br>your home is a place where you live<br>a home in a sense might be a constructed<br>space because it's something which is<br>the result of the interaction between<br>natural the house and social processes<br>the family Society so actually how we<br>understand it and how we use it as a<br>space is the product of those sets of<br>relations now this is not just a static<br>process when we construct space it's an<br>iterative process it's something which<br>continues to evolve we lived in caves<br>then in mud huts then in houses then in<br>skyscrapers and potential in the future<br>we might all live in communal buildings<br>Under the Sea who knows but our society<br>the way in which we construct space<br>develops but actually the construction<br>another example<br>Fisheries<br>in the days of old the oceans were<br>regarded as being a common space at<br>least before Spain and Portugal and the<br>UK got there they were a common space<br>they were open to all subject to freedom<br>of fishing<br>so that was how we<br>designated that space as a kind of legal<br>construct so we've got the oceans as a<br>common space<br>but by designating the oceans as a space<br>we began the process of changing the<br>nature of that space<br>when something is a common space anybody<br>can use that and so as more and more<br>people started to use the oceans to<br>catch fish as technology developed and<br>we're able to capture more and more fish<br>eventually<br>it resulted in a state where we were<br>over exploiting our Fisheries<br>so we started to change the nature of<br>the space it's not just simply a<br>designation as a label legal label we<br>actually caused fish stocks to deplete<br>because of the way in which we<br>constructed that space but of course we<br>react to that and so part of the process<br>of reacting to that depletion of a<br>resource is to then<br>try and limit use to carve up the oceans<br>and so we see the process of dividing up<br>the oceans into spaces of exclusive<br>control where we could limit access and<br>use<br>and so that then becomes the regime<br>which I talked about eez all these<br>exclusive areas which are allocated to<br>States but that in turn then generates<br>its own problems because as soon as we<br>start drawing lines in the ocean we<br>create boundaries and when we have<br>boundaries we have boundary problems<br>fish<br>brexit everybody saw the famous pictures<br>of brexit fish waving their UK passports<br>saying we're British fish but of course<br>that's not true<br>fish don't respect human-made boundaries<br>and so by creating boundaries between<br>states we then start to create other<br>problems problems of straddling stocks<br>shared resources and so that then<br>creates conflicts and we have to respond<br>to this by creating mechanisms of<br>control<br>so coming back to the whole point here<br>that space is a product it's a<br>constructed regime partially to do with<br>the material nature of the space but<br>partially to do with the social<br>processes which we apply to it it's<br>continual and it's evolving<br>I'm hoping you realize the reason why we<br>put the Dubai palm there is construction<br>at Sea sorry um you know just in case<br>all right<br>but<br>when we think about the oceans as a<br>space where we construct social<br>relations<br>we have to be sensitive to the nature of<br>ocean space<br>because if we're not sensitive to the<br>nature of ocean space we get things<br>wrong and we cause problems over<br>exploitation of Fisheries boundary<br>disputes are some of the examples of<br>that<br>and traditionally the reason why we tend<br>to get things wrong is because we treat<br>the oceans like land territory we carve<br>it up we delimit it we draw boundaries<br>but of course the oceans aren't like<br>that the oceans are a different space<br>they are fluid they are dynamic they are<br>Ever Changing if you think about drawing<br>a boundary on the oceans you're not<br>really fixing a space are you because<br>the currents in the ocean continue to<br>move across that boundary<br>and also when we think about the oceans<br>we're not just thinking about the oceans<br>as water we're thinking about them as<br>natural environments as ecosystems and<br>one of the things that science is<br>telling us now is that actually the<br>processes in the ocean are so<br>fundamentally connected that it's very<br>very difficult to separate them out<br>we can go hunting for COD but if we<br>ignore all the species that Cod predate<br>on then we're going to cause the<br>collapse of that stock<br>if we think about global warming we're<br>raising the temperatures of the oceans<br>and that's causing species to<br>redistribute<br>so we've got quite complex natural<br>processes taking place in the oceans<br>now that sounds fairly straightforward<br>but the problem is that when we start to<br>divide the oceans up we start to break<br>them down we start to run counter to<br>those kind of natural conditions<br>if we give some resources to one state<br>and other resources to another state can<br>they really regulate or control these<br>without cooperation without degrading<br>the environment so we need to be<br>sensitive to these types of interaction<br>when we're constructing ocean space<br>because if we don't we will get things<br>wrong<br>now just also kind of a bit of a summary<br>here<br>when law has been involved in the<br>construction of ocean space when we've<br>tried to Define legal regimes which help<br>us make use<br>of resources allow access to resources<br>it's done so often in a way which is not<br>sensitive to the nature of those<br>resources<br>and there are a couple of things where<br>law has traditionally gotten things<br>wrong<br>the first of these<br>is that it tends to treat all spaces the<br>same<br>so in the kind of little diagram there<br>it's as close to Churchill and those<br>I've got there Duncan so it's just for<br>you<br>um that's your kind of typical way of<br>delimiting the kind of Coastline so you<br>can imagine you're standing online<br>you're looking out to sea and around the<br>country you've got these bands of waters<br>out to 12 and 200 nautical miles but<br>those basic rules apply to all states<br>equally regardless of their geography<br>regardless of the ecological conditions<br>in those Waters regardless of who uses<br>those Waters it's simply a flat set of<br>rules applied to ocean space<br>law tends to ignore the specificities of<br>individual spaces so again another case<br>here dudlin Stevens the famous cannibal<br>case<br>some Sailors were Shipwrecked at Sea and<br>in order to survive they did what<br>everybody would do naturally they ate<br>the cabin boy<br>um<br>they came back to land and they were<br>prosecuted for murder<br>slightly kind of Macabre but the point<br>I'm making here is that the law the<br>criminal law at the time would apply<br>equally to what happens at Sea<br>regardless of the exigencies of the<br>situation so law ignores sometimes the<br>specificities of place locality event is<br>a little bit neutral or unrefined in<br>that respect and then the last of these<br>is King knuts I like this one it's my<br>favorite one so you're aware of the<br>legend of Canucks here the idea was that<br>he sat himself down on the coastline and<br>commanded the sea to stop and the title<br>Retreat and he did this not because he<br>was suffering from massive happiness but<br>because he wanted to demonstrate to his<br>courtiers that sometimes the remits of<br>natural man-made Authority has<br>boundaries the idea is that certain<br>things are beyond our control so when we<br>think about regulating the oceans it's<br>no good having a rule which commands the<br>tides to stop it's no good having a rule<br>which for example divides the oceans in<br>a Insurance of ecosystems because they<br>will still continue to happen regardless<br>of what law does<br>so law tends to ignore or at least<br>historically is tended to ignore those<br>subtleties in space and in practice<br>so property<br>I need to add a little bit of a caveat<br>here<br>so far I've really been talking about<br>State and State Control<br>and this is fine because under<br>international law international law is<br>basically about interactions between<br>states and States enjoy sovereignty and<br>control and jurisdiction they don't tend<br>to enjoy ownership of spaces so I'm<br>going to be talking about France holding<br>the oceans of the UK owning the oceans<br>being a bit of a misnomer there actually<br>the exercise Authority sovereignty or<br>jurisdiction over these activities<br>so I'm not really talking about property<br>so far but<br>I think we can still think of property<br>and we still can't talk about property<br>because as I indicated it's not just<br>states which enjoy control of the oceans<br>but actually when we think about how<br>States justify their claims how they<br>generate these claims to ocean space we<br>can understand it in property type terms<br>because ultimately property is all about<br>excludability your ability to exclude<br>through law access to a particular<br>resource and when we think about State<br>that's pretty much exactly what they're<br>doing now it's not just me that's<br>telling you that there's many eminent<br>Jews going back to people like Hirsch<br>lauterpact who talked about<br>International laws being the kind of<br>product of private law sources and<br>analogies and part of the reason for<br>this is because Lord doesn't exist in a<br>vacuum we draw upon whatever legal<br>material is to hand in order to help us<br>explain the world international law was<br>largely a product of the 17th 18th<br>centuries but in order to kind of<br>formulate the basic rules on what states<br>couldn't couldn't do they drew up on<br>canonical law domestic law and including<br>property institutions every country in<br>the world has a concept of property<br>every country in the world has a legal<br>system with property rules and so it's<br>no surprise that international law has<br>developed on lines at least analogous to<br>the way in which property has developed<br>I like this picture um so it's James<br>gilray there so it's the idea of um The<br>Plum puddings fit to burst here back in<br>the kind of mid 19th century States<br>carving up the world between them just<br>in the way that we kind of carve up the<br>land between us in terms of property<br>there so Echoes of that<br>bit eurocentric mind you but well that's<br>something that we have to live with and<br>redress<br>okay so ownership<br>so when we think about ownership I think<br>we're all familiar with property in kind<br>of general terms we might own a car we<br>might own a house a laptop a pen a<br>mobile phone but property is not some<br>single monolithic concept is it Martin<br>land lawyer at the back there so okay so<br>property is a complex set of legal<br>relationships here the idea is actually<br>although we have a concept of property<br>property itself at least in legal terms<br>is understood as a series of Dural<br>relations and what do we mean by Dural<br>relations we actually mean that property<br>is a bundle of different rights<br>entitlements and responsibilities so a<br>famous legal scholar a philosopher<br>honorary developed the idea of the<br>incidence of ownership and what he did<br>was to break down this monolithic<br>concept of property into its incidents<br>so typically property in varying degrees<br>involves the right of possession this is<br>my Clicker it's the right to use<br>something oh look I'm going backwards<br>and forwards nobody's telling me what to<br>do I have that Authority because I'm the<br>owner of my clicker oh spoiler alert<br>there so philosophy coming your way<br>um it's the right to manage to make<br>decisions about how your resource can be<br>used it's the right to income if you<br>want to lease something out it's the<br>capital your ability to use or even<br>destroy your property you can burn your<br>house down if you want<br>um it's the right to security the state<br>will guarantee or will make available<br>you can use your house as security<br>transmit trans sorry I'm getting tired<br>now transmissibility the idea that you<br>can pass possession of your property<br>over absence of terms the idea well well<br>let's not go into the absence of terms<br>um non-harmful use I've got this one<br>underlined here because actually<br>everything so far has been rights<br>entitlements and claims it takes us to<br>get to number nine where we actually<br>find the first rule of property which<br>suggests that you're not allowed to use<br>your property in a way which is harmful<br>to others you've also got liability to<br>execution so if you do something wrong<br>somebody can take your property away<br>from you and then last but not least<br>you've got residuality the idea that<br>your property if you do something with<br>it you loan it you lend it it's used and<br>to execute some debts on if all other<br>claims have been exhausted it will come<br>back to you so it bounce back effect<br>here<br>so even in law what we have here is the<br>notion of property which is very much<br>focused on rights and claims exclusive<br>entitlements but with one balancing no<br>harm use there and that I would suggest<br>here renders property very much useful<br>for that kind of process of<br>commodification that I talked about<br>earlier on the idea that claims are made<br>we commodify things we see them as<br>objects of value and we use and exploit<br>them all right so that's a little bit<br>about property now property doesn't<br>exist in a vacuum property exists<br>because Society decides that property is<br>a useful institution and fundamentally<br>property<br>is a legal regime which governs the<br>relationships between people in respect<br>of things and that's quite an important<br>distinction property is a legal<br>relationship between people in respect<br>of things property is not directly me<br>and a relationship with a thing it's a<br>relationship between members of society<br>and a thing the property itself is the<br>object of legal relations it's not the<br>subject of them that's quite important<br>here<br>and the reason why we have property is<br>because we need to decide how best to<br>distribute the world's resources between<br>us to avoid conflict and so on and so<br>forth so a number of theories have been<br>put forward which seek to kind of<br>explain and justify why we have this<br>regime of property and we can see Echoes<br>of how these apply to Ocean spaces so<br>let's take for example John Locke and<br>his labor Theory this was something<br>which is derived from natural rights the<br>idea is that each and every single one<br>of us has property in our own body my<br>body is my own and I can do with it what<br>I will it's kind of derived from the<br>idea of inherent equality of all<br>individuals and no person is able to<br>dictate what another person does with<br>their body<br>but the idea of the labor Theory that if<br>then I invest the labor of my body into<br>that thing and if I own my body and I<br>invest my labor into something then I'm<br>entitled to the product of my labor so<br>for example a farmer who tills his field<br>is that labor which justifies his<br>entitlement to his property<br>so the idea of the labor theory is that<br>if we do something<br>to the real world if we capture it if we<br>hunt if we Harvest it if we go fishing<br>then that generates a legal claim to it<br>but there are problems with the labor<br>theory of property and there are some<br>caveats to this so for example<br>a couple has sex they have a child is<br>the child the product of their labor and<br>does it have its own autonomy so there<br>are limits to the way in which the<br>natural rights Theory might apply there<br>are also ones which Locke recognized<br>the idea behind the labor theory is that<br>it has certain limits<br>just because you labor on something<br>doesn't necessarily mean you will always<br>get everything that you labor on because<br>ultimately that may reduce the amount<br>that's left over for others so we've got<br>the caveat the Lockheed improviso that<br>you can labor on something and you can<br>own something but only so far as enough<br>and as good as left over for others<br>because that would result in a<br>destabilization of society equally<br>you're not allowed to accrue things<br>beyond their ability to survive so if<br>you harvest too many things and they<br>spoil it's morally wrong for you to keep<br>those things so although that justifies<br>the institution of private property<br>there are some caveats and exceptions to<br>this which are there to benefit others<br>and Society more generally<br>the other problem is that um<br>you can do the wrong thing with your<br>labor you can capture people you can<br>subject them to slavery<br>so the idea is that labor in of itself<br>isn't sufficient it has to be productive<br>or socially beneficial labor so it<br>wasn't until maybe the 20th century when<br>somebody like Monza came along where he<br>combined labor with dessert and it's the<br>idea that only socially productive labor<br>entitles you to claim something<br>so if you're fishing and you over<br>exploit things it's not socially<br>productive so should you catch what you<br>keep what you catch so we can see how<br>these might apply<br>so that's the natural rights theory of<br>property the next theory of property is<br>the liberty-based approach here now<br>quickly deal with this one the idea of<br>Liberty accounts of property is that<br>basically unless people have access to<br>certain material resources they will not<br>be able to function as social agents if<br>I'm beholden to Karen for my food if I'm<br>beholden to Duncan for the house then<br>they will be able to pressurize me and<br>ask me to do things I might not<br>otherwise want to because the means of<br>my existence are dependent upon their<br>will so the idea is that Liberty<br>justifies the granting a certain<br>property to individuals because it<br>enables them to be political actors<br>straightforward so<br>if we look at the oceans we think for<br>example the claims that States make or<br>that individuals make the fisherman who<br>goes to see he needs to fish to earn<br>money to survive but also to be a<br>socially productive actor if we think<br>about States they make claims to Ocean<br>spaces because without access to<br>resources they may be dependent on<br>others so when we looked at for example<br>the generation of exclusive economic<br>zones throughout history these were<br>actually very much driven by developing<br>States who made the argument that<br>without control of their Coastal Waters<br>their economies would not be strong<br>enough and they would be dependent on<br>the charity and benefit of more powerful<br>states so Liberty justifies some claims<br>but there are problems with Liberty<br>because Liberty whilst it might justify<br>control and access to Resource Liberty<br>can be secured through other means it<br>doesn't just have to be a system of<br>private property why not common property<br>ever a material needs are being met<br>through a system of common property<br>through Social Security do we really<br>need private property<br>and there's also the problem that<br>Liberty resists patterned<br>redistributions of wealth<br>Liberty often requires us to resist<br>harmful or at least restrictive<br>interferences by the state so in this<br>kind of tradition property has been seen<br>as a bulker against intrusion by the<br>state it gives us the power to resist<br>the state but in order to protect that<br>it resists the redistribution of wealth<br>so most Libertarians struggle with the<br>idea of how to reconcile the Liberty<br>notion of property with the distribution<br>of wealth in order to meet social or<br>other needs there is a public Dimension<br>to it but it's one which is not<br>particularly well articulated utility<br>the idea of welfare maximization here<br>the greatest good of the greatest number<br>the idea is that somehow<br>we need property because it enables us<br>to maximize our well-being as Aristotle<br>said if we don't have private property<br>we will have conflict over natural<br>resources so property the idea to<br>delimit through law certain entitlements<br>helps us reduce conflict<br>we've got Hume the idea is that property<br>is really just security of expectations<br>as individuals we need to plan for our<br>lives we need to be able to look to the<br>Future and do things and we can only do<br>that if we have security of expectations<br>and property by guaranteeing to<br>individuals the return from their things<br>helps secure those expectations and then<br>most famously we've got Bentham I love<br>this picture of Bentham the auto icon<br>this statue his body is um on display at<br>UCL in London a man who's committed to<br>his cause in the favor of science here<br>again Bentham was a strong advocate of<br>this utilitarian notion of property<br>so<br>property exists because it benefits<br>Society but of course the problem with<br>utilitarianism is that it can result in<br>decisions which are harmful to<br>particular Goods to particular parts of<br>society if you're doing something which<br>benefits the majority what about the<br>minority utilitarianism has its own<br>flaws as a justificatory regime<br>the next of the regimes we've got are<br>economic approaches to property um I<br>love this one there's a book by wrongva<br>hanison who basically wrote a tree Ties<br>on why we should privatize the oceans I<br>know kind of two lines of argument which<br>he proposed here and the idea here is<br>that we need to privatize the oceans we<br>need private property because<br>it's about the efficient use of<br>resources and it's about preventing<br>destructive competition for resources so<br>part of his work here is based upon the<br>seminal tragedy of the commons by<br>Garrett Hardin in 1969. the idea of the<br>tragedy of the commons is that if we<br>have land which is open to war and we're<br>entitled to graze our capital on that<br>land then ultimately this will lead to<br>the degradation of that resource and the<br>kind of logic behind this is that if you<br>graze your cattle on land for free you<br>get the benefits of fat cattle grazing<br>on that land but you don't pay for the<br>costs of that they are basically defraed<br>across all members of society who have<br>access to this common land<br>so ultimately because we're all rational<br>actors we like something for free we<br>graze and Grays and Grays and Grays and<br>eventually the common land is depleted<br>and the only way to prevent this is to<br>basically introduce private property to<br>stop that overuse of resource to allow<br>certain people to exclude others from<br>access to the resource that happened<br>with cattle but it's also happened with<br>fish stocks the common fish stocks<br>problem that I talked about earlier on<br>and the other argument behind this is<br>that also by creating private property<br>it allows for the most efficient use of<br>resources property rights are marketable<br>we can transfer them and ultimately<br>property rights will accrue in the hands<br>of those best place to make use of them<br>it's the foundations of the market<br>system and that results in the most<br>efficient allocation of resources so<br>that's worked so well more generally so<br>another lesser known justification for<br>property is property as propriety this<br>is often associated with Civic<br>republicanism and the idea here is that<br>we give property to those persons who<br>are best able to make use of it for<br>society<br>for example the homeowner enjoys<br>property in their home because it allows<br>them to do the things which you require<br>done at home the farm operates as land<br>because it produces food for society the<br>fisherman owns the fish because he<br>catches that and brings that food home<br>for society so the idea here is that you<br>give property to those best able to make<br>use of it and this is often associated<br>with stewardship the idea that those<br>people who have control of things<br>because of their position are also under<br>responsibilities to make best use of<br>that for the benefits of society now<br>it's a great idea it's a great ideal but<br>the problem that we have with it is that<br>how do we get those persons to ensure<br>that they act on behalf of those they<br>are meant to be acting for if you're the<br>steward who requires you to do the<br>things that you're stewarding for<br>in the absence of strong legal systems<br>these things don't work<br>so what does property tell us well most<br>of the systems the justifications of<br>private property tend to prioritize<br>private rights and excludability for<br>individuals but also for states to take<br>claims<br>there's another problem with um the kind<br>of justifications for property is that<br>whilst property is a social construct<br>most of the justifications are ones<br>which are designed to enhance individual<br>benefits and not Collective benefits and<br>in the absence of strong controls either<br>upon individuals or upon States if we<br>have no strong public values which we're<br>pursuing through the institution of<br>property we tend to find that property<br>runs a mock and it's probably<br>then the last point I wanted to make<br>here was the oceans are an object of<br>social processes again throughout<br>history the way in which we treat the<br>oceans has been the object of human<br>relations we impose our Wills our values<br>onto it and we don't understand it as<br>part of it more interactive coherent<br>approach<br>so what we have there is a system of<br>property a system of State control which<br>is ultimately LED I think to the<br>degradation of the oceans because it's<br>pushing the wrong sets of values<br>so where does that take us well we've<br>got to think a little bit more<br>constructively for the future<br>so a couple of kind of just reminders<br>there sort of summary points to first of<br>all law hand of History heavy on her<br>shoulders what's been done in the past<br>continues to be done and the<br>institutions of property and control<br>have tended to accrue wealth in the<br>hands of some states of some individuals<br>most of the law that we have on the<br>oceans is resource orientated it's all<br>about exploiting and extracting<br>and when we think about all the<br>justifications that have been Advanced<br>for this they tend to be used in an<br>extract of a partial manner we don't<br>always add the caveats the kind of<br>public constraints on property<br>so how do we respond to that well here's<br>where things get imaginative a couple of<br>kind of recommendations for the future<br>the first thing that we need to do is to<br>think a little bit differently we need<br>new imaginaries if we do things the way<br>they've always been done then we're<br>going to repeat the mistakes of the past<br>so what we have here is some artwork by<br>a Swedish artist called Simon stalinghat<br>and what he was basically commissioned<br>to do was to kind of create some images<br>about what potential future Visions for<br>the oceans and what they might look like<br>um so on the kind of top left there<br>we've got the oceans as kind of<br>commodified Factories at Sea capturing<br>and processing Fisheries reducing it to<br>consumption products for consumption a<br>fairly Bleak dystopian future<br>below that we've got the oceans<br>um it's called The Rime of the Ancient<br>Mariner parody on the past one where<br>basically you've got an individual<br>sailing at Sea in a depleted ocean<br>trying to find whatever's left over<br>amongst the hulks of our industrial<br>wreckage these are kind of Pathways<br>which if we commit to if we continue to<br>over exploit we could potentially lead<br>ourselves towards but on the left hand<br>side of the slides here we've got some<br>more optimistic opportunities on the<br>bottom we've got oceans of the future<br>and here we've got the idea that<br>individuals through technology are<br>thinking of new ways in which to<br>interact with the oceans to rebuild<br>natural habitats to view them as<br>processes as structures as ecosystems of<br>value in and of themselves and not just<br>as things to be consumed then above that<br>potentially in the weird and distant<br>sci-fi future we'll be living closer to<br>the Seas part of the problems that we<br>have as Society is that the oceans are<br>distant from us<br>30 odd miles that way to the North Sea<br>most of us don't interact regularly with<br>the oceans we don't have close relations<br>with the oceans so part of this is about<br>strangling and structuring and<br>participating the process of law<br>creation and through that we can help<br>construct new ways and New Visions for<br>the future anyway I think I'm probably<br>out of time so I'm going to stop there<br>and thank you for your attention so<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
