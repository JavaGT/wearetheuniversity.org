Alzheimer’s disease, well-known as a devastating neurological disorder, is on the rise in New Zealand and around the world. Treating the disorder is thus one of the supreme challenges of neuroscience. The challenges are numerous, but progress is slowly being made, not only internationally but also at Otago. The talk reviews some of the challenges but also reasons for hope in treating the disease.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated

very<br>shortly<br>everybody it's Sheila Murray here<br>director of Developmental alumni welcome<br>you to the last of our webinars in the<br>series match with the Targo put on by<br>the alumni and development office here<br>at otago we're very excited to have<br>tonight Professor Cliff Abraham<br>um and certainly a great pleasure to<br>welcome him to the um Dewey's<br>presentation so just a few<br>um<br>mechanical rules if you like them if you<br>want to ask a question at the end of the<br>presentation please do so in the Q a<br>button at the bottom of your screen and<br>we will then Endeavor to ask your<br>question at the end of Cliff's<br>presentation we are hoping to go for an<br>hour but if there's a lot of interest we<br>may go a bit longer but certainly we'll<br>see how it goes um so um as I mentioned<br>welcome lovely to see you all registered<br>here on on this um presentation tonight<br>um Cliff is<br>um presenting on Alzheimer's disease<br>Challenge and hope and Professor Cliff<br>Abraham it has research interests in the<br>neural mechanisms memory he has played a<br>leading role in promoting Neuroscience<br>research and teaching at the University<br>of otago and nationally in 1997 he was<br>elected as a fellow of the Royal Society<br>of New Zealand and in 2007 he was<br>awarded James Cook Fellowship he was<br>awarded the University of otago's<br>distinguished research medal in 2009 and<br>the division of Sciences research of the<br>year in 2018. currently he's director of<br>a major hrc-funded research program<br>investing bio investigating biomarkers<br>and therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's<br>disease he has played a leading role in<br>promoting Neuroscience research and<br>teaching at the University of otago and<br>nationally and is currently co-leader of<br>the national aotearoa Brain Project<br>kopapa Aurora or aorta Tira after<br>completing his PhD in Neuroscience with<br>um he took five years of post-doctoral<br>research at the University of otago and<br>the University of Gothenburg Sweden<br>before taking up a role here in<br>Psychology at the University of otago so<br>welcome Professor Abraham and we look<br>thank you so much for the introduction<br>um yes so as Sheila mentioned I've been<br>at the University for a long time over<br>40 years so there must be something here<br>that I like and I like the cherry<br>blossoms<br>um and I work in a really great<br>Department the department of psychology<br>which I could work on for a long time<br>but equally um<br>uh and one of the real appeals of being<br>here is that there's a great collegial<br>network of neuroscientists uh working<br>across the university in the medical<br>school and then in the sciences and<br>um held together with by glue with uh by<br>the brain health research center with<br>the logo of which you can see here which<br>is currently directed by professor<br>professor Stephanie Hughes<br>uh but<br>um you'll see from this talk that my own<br>work has benefited a lot by<br>collaborating with um with my colleagues<br>around the university in different<br>departments<br>but I also just want to point out the<br>author of our brain project that<br>Sheila's mentioned because I'm a<br>co-director of that at the moment helped<br>set it up and we've just launched a<br>little while ago which aims to actually<br>serve that same glue role networking<br>role and promotion of Neuroscience<br>research across the country to improve<br>find ways to improve brain health for<br>everyone in New Zealand reducing<br>equities<br>and just get the research going further<br>and faster and better so we're really<br>looking forward to an exciting Journey<br>with the altario brain project<br>so I'd like to start with um<br>next slide if I can get it<br>yeah uh that looks like a tunnel uh and<br>yes actually indeed it is a tunnel<br>um and the reason I have it there is<br>because it's supposed to represent<br>life's journey which I know very well is<br>not a straight road there's lots of<br>forks in the road and different Pathways<br>that you take by a chance or by accident<br>like me coming to New Zealand<br>um and you sort of loop around and you<br>go different directions<br>but in the end we're hoping as life goes<br>on that we can reach those golden years<br>in good shape with good brain health and<br>we'll we're able to enjoy those years<br>um with our family and friends<br>but of course one of the key things<br>there is that we need good brain health<br>to reach that objective<br>so I get to talk about my favorite<br>subject here which is the brain and here<br>we are looking at a human brain a<br>picture of a human brain uh from a<br>top-down view with the front of the<br>brain here at the top of the screen back<br>to the brain here and you can see<br>actually well you may or may not know<br>but this is a very healthy looking brain<br>nice fat diary very narrow uh gaps<br>between them<br>if you had a plant analogy I would call<br>this a cauliflower<br>so very<br>um very tight connection or tight<br>groupings of all this cortical uh<br>now if you um but that's not the best<br>part in a way because you can you slice<br>the brain down the middle and then turn<br>it sideways if you can see it fits in<br>the palm of your hand and there's very<br>intricate structures inside the brain<br>that you can't see just from the outside<br>looking in too many to go into here but<br>you know here's another little<br>cauliflower looking like structure of<br>the cerebellum and lots of interesting<br>important<br>um groupings of nerve cells and nuclei<br>and so forth that we as we call them<br>um that coordinate with the cortex to<br>drive cognition and all our all our<br>behaviors<br>and this brain is only<br>um about a one and a half or so<br>kilograms so it's only about two percent<br>of body weight<br>but it uses twenty percent of the<br>cardiac output<br>so it's very hungry and thirsty it needs<br>lots of<br>you know<br>nutrition and it needs lots of oxygen<br>and it's a very busy uh organ and so it<br>takes as I say 20 of the output<br>so if we look inside there's of course<br>lots of nerve cells and here's just a<br>diagram of a of a stain that's stained<br>just a few of them there aren't really<br>lots of gaps between them it's there's<br>lots and lots of cells in here you just<br>can't see them all with this picture and<br>in fact the human brain is made up of<br>about 100 billion nerve cells<br>and if you think about the connections<br>between them that's about you know ten<br>thousand times that number<br>so there's a lot of processing power and<br>a lot of cells it's a very highly<br>coordinated Society of cells that work<br>together to produce<br>our behavioral outputs our emotions our<br>thoughts our movements<br>now in addition to those nerve cells we<br>have what I like to call the brains<br>Guardians and these are cells that are<br>in the brain but they're not nerve cells<br>they're non-neural cells and we have<br>represented here on the left we have<br>astrocytes labeled in red<br>they're called astrocytes because they<br>sort of look like star-shaped cells with<br>processes coming out from around the<br>Central Center<br>and they play a very important support<br>role and communicate with neurons to<br>enhance their efficiency and<br>productivity and also help keep them<br>healthy<br>and on the right there's another kind of<br>Guardian cell called microglia<br>so they have very spidery looking<br>processes thin processes coming out<br>there's one there's one there's one<br>there's one you can see that<br>there are many many microglia around as<br>well they are the resident immune cell<br>inside the brain and they serve a lot of<br>cleanup functions as do the astrocytes<br>to a certain extent to remove damaged<br>material damage debris and<br>material<br>um<br>microbes maybe and and other infectious<br>um things coming into the brain so<br>basically they're really on the constant<br>surveillance of the tissue and they can<br>actually move it's kind of creepy to<br>think about these things creeping<br>through your brain but they can move to<br>the sites of disorder and surround them<br>and try to eliminate them by engulfing<br>abnormal material<br>so these are very important parts of the<br>process as well and there's as many<br>actually way probably way more of these<br>kinds of non-neural cells as there are<br>the actual nerve cells which indicates<br>how important they are for normal brain<br>function<br>now the other Guardian is what we call<br>the blood-brain barrier so now we're<br>looking at<br>a capillary here on sort of and on<br>so it'll be coarse blood will be coming<br>into the brain and material is going to<br>be going into the brain from the blood<br>supply but only a certain material<br>because<br>the blood vessels are encapsulated by<br>different cell types endothelial cells<br>pericites astrocytes and cells and so<br>forth so that only certain things are<br>allowed out of the bloodstream into the<br>brain because there's lots of things in<br>here in the blood supply that would<br>actually be damaging to brain function<br>so it's very important to only transport<br>in the things that are that are needed<br>and not the things that would be<br>damaging<br>so this is the third level of protection<br>okay well<br>here's the challenge<br>we've been talking about Alzheimer's<br>disease and really what happens there is<br>that this tunnel that we're or this<br>roadway that we're trying to take to the<br>golden years<br>um becomes blocked and interrupted and<br>difficult to get through<br>and it's kind of look this is kind of<br>symbolic of the disease because disease<br>is characterized by accumulations of<br>material that get in the way of nerve<br>cell function as well it's not just kind<br>of in the way of the pathway and this is<br>the challenge that's represented by<br>actually not just the Alzheimer's<br>disease but many other aging related<br>neurological disorders Parkinson's<br>disease disease benzo Temple difference<br>and so forth<br>so this is the challenge and obviously<br>it's a difficult challenge because<br>people have been studying Alzheimer's<br>disease in ways to kind of treat it for<br>decades<br>and we're only just beginning to make<br>some progress but at least that's a<br>positive thing and you'll be hearing a<br>so Alzheimer's disease<br>um<br>is the best known and most widely found<br>form of dementia so dementia is kind of<br>a catch-all term for many diseases but<br>Alzheimer's disease makes up 50 to 70<br>percent of cases so it's a very severe<br>problem as I think everyone knows I<br>don't think I need to describe the<br>symptoms because that they're very<br>commonly known beginning with memory<br>disorders but progress to all facets<br>brain function<br>and eventually ending in death<br>so a normal healthy brain by the end<br>stage begins to look like this<br>and just by looking you can tell this is<br>not very healthy now it's not the nice<br>cauliflower shape but the the diary as<br>they're called to become much thinner<br>and the gaps between them are fissures<br>they look like<br>um you know big cavities Caverns<br>um that are developing between the Joey<br>and this is basically just because so<br>much brain tissue has been lost so many<br>cells have died off so it's no surprise<br>that brain function is completely<br>compromised when you get to this stage<br>and what we know about the pathology is<br>that<br>um there's accumulation of different<br>kinds of proteins that get into the way<br>that sort of block the tunnel<br>get in the way of normal North self<br>nerve cell function and it can actually<br>kill them off<br>so for example up here are examples of<br>tissue stained for what are called<br>amyloid plaques made up of a small piece<br>of protein or short peptide called<br>amyloid<br>and they gather at in in clumps that<br>that are kind of insoluble in a very and<br>difficult even for the guardian cells to<br>get rid of so they develop and<br>accumulate more and more here's a<br>close-up of one such plaque<br>the other thing that accumulates<br>um is is inside the cell called Tangles<br>made up of a different protein called<br>Tau which gets into a<br>dysfunctional form and they start to<br>aggregate into insoluble forms as well<br>they build up inside a cell and<br>eventually kill that cell off as you can<br>sort of see in this case<br>so these are pro this is basically a<br>protein aggregation disease and in fact<br>many of the neurological degenerative<br>neurological disorders of various kinds<br>are protein aggregation disorders<br>but involve maybe different proteins and<br>aggregating in different parts of the<br>brain to give the different disease<br>phenotypes<br>so um<br>it is the<br>uh really post-mortem analysis of brains<br>looking at these Aggregates that really<br>help us define whether a person has<br>Alzheimer's disease<br>people may be diagnosed as probable<br>Alzheimer's disease while they're living<br>but it's based on educated guests based<br>on the clinical information available<br>but really it takes formal postmortem<br>pathological analyzes to confirm for<br>sure and of course this is not often<br>done because Indian there's probably no<br>now part of the problem with the<br>Alzheimer's disease is that as these<br>Aggregates form and cells die off these<br>brain Guardian cells get activated<br>so the astrocytes become uh hype become<br>hypertrophied they get expanded<br>processes they get fat and thick they<br>look they can they can just look<br>activated look angry<br>um as they're trying to deal with the<br>Disturbed tissue around them<br>and also the micro glare over here uh<br>lose their spidery processes and they<br>they form more globular structures as<br>they moved around to the site of<br>disorder trying to engulf the dead and<br>dying material<br>so this is a form of neuroinflammation<br>as we call it<br>and um<br>and normally you you would as you know<br>about inflammation generally<br>this is a good thing this is part of the<br>body's natural reaction to damage<br>anywhere<br>whether you sprain your ankle breaking<br>break an arm you will get inflammation<br>they to deal with the problem and<br>eventually gets fixed and the<br>inflammation dies down<br>but because these are insoluble plaques<br>and Tangles the the the the triggers for<br>the inflammatory response never go away<br>and then the fact that these cells<br>remain activated releasing their<br>chemicals that are supposed to help with<br>the inflammation but if released and<br>maintained over a long period of time<br>causes damage actually so we get<br>additional damage<br>to the brain because these immune cells<br>are no longer working as as best they<br>can<br>and what's more the blood-brain barrier<br>because of these neuroinflammatory<br>responses become leaky and things that<br>are not supposed to be in the brain<br>start getting the brain from from the<br>blood supply as well<br>so it's just a kind of a negative spiral<br>of events<br>um that just make the situation in the<br>brain worse and worse over time<br>so what are the big issues in terms of<br>dealing with the disease<br>first of all we would like to actually<br>prevent it obviously and if not prevent<br>it we'd like to delay the onset so that<br>people have a good quality of life for<br>as long as possible<br>second of all we'd like to actually be<br>able to detect the disease early<br>and that's very important because the<br>earlier you can detect it the more<br>effective treatments are likely to be<br>and finally we actually need to have<br>effective treatments and that's been a<br>major issue because we're still<br>walking around the edges of this and<br>that's one of the major challenges<br>there are some treatments currently<br>approved<br>um but again they generally only come<br>online after clinical diagnosis<br>which means that already brain has<br>suffered a lot of damage so if we could<br>just get it to happen<br>earlier if we get the early detection<br>going then some of these treatments<br>might actually be more effective and but<br>still probably even still need new<br>treatments<br>okay so for prevention or delay<br>it's basically old Edge I'm sure you've<br>all heard<br>use it or lose it<br>not use or it or lose it but use it or<br>lose it so um<br>so just like muscles<br>the muscles<br>are more functional you might say<br>healthier if you use them than if you<br>don't use them in the atrophy brain is<br>very similar<br>so the things that you can do to help<br>delay at least the onset of degenerative<br>diseases and Alzheimer's disease is to<br>use your brain and to keep it in a<br>healthy environment of healthy body<br>environment<br>so good diet good exercise<br>good social connections<br>um<br>keeping your way within a normal limit<br>is good because obesity is also<br>associated with inflammation in the<br>brain<br>I'm not sure about writing checkbooks I<br>mean that checks that's not really<br>something you can do anymore but I'd<br>like to think of it as going shopping<br>so I heard someone say that actually<br>going shopping is good for you you get a<br>bit of exercise walking around you use<br>your brain looking for your Bargains you<br>do it socially and you probably have a<br>good healthy lunch while you're doing it<br>so<br>um maybe you should go shopping<br>if you're a smoker actually the best<br>thing you can do is stop smoking<br>so these are things that that you can do<br>in your own life<br>um to delay at least the onset of<br>neurological many neurological disorders<br>and also other other<br>issues or health issues and the rest of<br>your body for that matter by following<br>now what about early detection well<br>basically early detection has been<br>almost impossible because the disease<br>actually can start 10 15 20 years before<br>actual clinical diagnosis<br>and we've only come to realize this<br>through longitudinal studies over some<br>period of time<br>but with the emergence of some Modern<br>Technologies like so-called pet scans<br>where you inject a little bit of a<br>radioactive tracer that can bind onto<br>the amyloid plaques there is this<br>technique then that can be used to<br>determine whether a person's brain has<br>developing Alzheimer's disease<br>unfortunately these kinds of scans are<br>expensive<br>they're not able to be done most places<br>in the country or the world on in a few<br>centers that have these pet scan<br>scanning techniques<br>and so it's not really a really<br>available readily available for the many<br>many people who have potentially<br>Alzheimer's disease developing their<br>brains do we need something better<br>although it is a tool in the toolkit<br>should clinicians feel the need to check<br>so what would what we've been doing here<br>at the University of Targo<br>who uh<br>a collaboration<br>funded by the health research Council<br>beginning some more than 10 years ago<br>now and led by associate professor<br>Joanna Williams in the anatomy<br>Department<br>and with some other<br>important colleagues to this effort<br>including um Diane Vermont uh who's been<br>doing a lot of the Hands-On work in the<br>lab and Professor Warren Tate<br>biochemistry and Nick huckfield who's a<br>so um we've been studying the potential<br>of a blood test for early stage<br>Alzheimer's disease looking at a<br>particular molecule called micro RNA<br>tiny strands of RNA which<br>um can escape out of cells and even out<br>of the brain into the blood supply<br>and can be measured in plasma samples<br>that you take from patients or study<br>participants<br>and our group has found that actually it<br>only takes measuring of a couple micro<br>RNA in the blood supply give a very<br>sensitive indicator of whether someone<br>has<br>um early on early signs of Alzheimer's<br>disease with 86 specificity and 80 80<br>sensitivity which means that there's a<br>very high likelihood of detecting<br>someone who has it and also very likely<br>very high likelihood of<br>saying that someone who doesn't have a<br>disease they don't actually have it<br>so this is a very promising<br>um test<br>um that we're we're working to um<br>uh but based on samples we collected<br>here in Dunedin actually but also from<br>samples that have been attained overseas<br>from Australia in the USA and we're<br>trying to interest<br>um drug companies in helping progress<br>This research to a scale where we can do<br>this<br>um in much larger populations and<br>hopefully roll it out as some kind of<br>test in in the not too distant future<br>and for that purpose<br>um working with the taco Innovation<br>we've gotten again led by Joanna uh got<br>a provisional patent here in New Zealand<br>um that we are now working to progress<br>to later stages<br>so this is our new hope that's come just<br>out of research here at the University<br>of otago<br>um through a dedicated interest in this<br>early detection issue I want to give out<br>a shout out to the University otago<br>Foundation trust because<br>there was a time uh when the funding was<br>running out from the HRC<br>Council and we were needed to keep the<br>research going and people kindly donated<br>towards this blood test research effort<br>through the University of otago<br>foundation trust and helped us keep it<br>going<br>um and so we're immensely if you're one<br>of those we're immensely grateful to you<br>now what about treatment<br>this has been the bug bear really for<br>decades trying to find something that<br>will actually work against the disease<br>and again so the question is is this all<br>challenge or is there still now New Hope<br>so what does it take to get a good<br>treatment<br>well here's a list of uh you know sort<br>of a shopping list of things that we'd<br>like to see in a treatment first of all<br>of course it needs to be effective<br>to be nice if it's long lasting so you<br>didn't have to keep taking the treatment<br>over and over again<br>daily or weekly or monthly<br>didn't mean you wanted to be<br>non-invasive you don't want to have to<br>open up<br>all and inject things into the brain<br>through neurosurgery which is not which<br>is not practical of course and has lots<br>of risks anyway you want to deliver it<br>to the whole brain is the disease in the<br>end gets to the whole brain<br>you want it to so that means you're<br>probably going to be taking it orally or<br>injecting something in the periphery in<br>order to use the blood supply to take<br>your treatment through the whole brain<br>and that will mean that you have your<br>treatment has to get across that<br>blood-brain barrier that I've just been<br>telling you about<br>and of course she went few if any side<br>effects then it should be affordable<br>so<br>uh it's a long wish list and maybe<br>difficult to hit all the targets but<br>this is the sort of thing that we're<br>looking for<br>so as I mentioned people have been<br>um studying this these aren't our people<br>these are just random people pictured<br>off the internet but people have been<br>working at this um like I say for a long<br>time trying to find ways forward and<br>there's lots of strategies for this you<br>might have antibodies to those toxic<br>proteins that can bind to them and take<br>them out of the system or you might<br>develop drugs that inhibit the enzymes<br>that make those toxic proteins<br>you might have drugs that to attack the<br>neuroinflammation response<br>and potentially you might be able to<br>actually repurpose drugs already and use<br>for something else<br>so there's lots of strategies and there<br>has been some progress in the antibody<br>front so you may have heard the news in<br>the recent over the last nine twelve<br>months that two new drugs have been<br>approved by the FDA in the U.S the Food<br>and Drug Administration for treatment of<br>more recently<br>and although they've been approved<br>they've been really approved more on a<br>wish in a than a prayer than<br>um hard scientific evidence that they<br>can actually manage all those<br>um uh get all those<br>uh Target points that I've just<br>mentioned you for treatment and<br>particularly effectiveness<br>so they have some sign of being<br>effective<br>but not a huge effect and not for all<br>that much longer than normal and they<br>come with potential side effects that<br>can be quite serious so although they've<br>been approved I'm sure people will be<br>lining up to get them they'll be<br>expensive and<br>uh whether they'll be you know good<br>value for money in the end is still<br>questionable but it is a step forward<br>from where we have been so I think<br>there's reason to be grateful that<br>there's this kind of work going on<br>but we're taking another approach and<br>that is<br>um we want to talk about maybe producing<br>more positively acting proteins in the<br>brain<br>and we're taking our clue here from the<br>so-called nun study I don't know if<br>you've heard of the nun study<br>it's really old study now but um<br>quite some time ago researchers decided<br>to study<br>678 American members of the school<br>sisters of Notre Dame across the USA<br>beginning In Minnesota where the study<br>study research is actually located<br>so these uh women were at the time of<br>study was 75 to 106 years old<br>and they were chosen because<br>they live they lived a fairly<br>um<br>parallel and consistent lives in terms<br>of their environmental exposures their<br>diet<br>probably their level of exercise their<br>interactions with other people so it<br>removes a lot of variability that you<br>might just get from the general public<br>population and the interesting thing is<br>they you know there's masses of data<br>that are collected about them and one of<br>the things that was collected was that<br>the researchers had X access to was the<br>autobiographical essays that the young<br>women wrote when they when they applied<br>to join the order in their early 20s<br>and what the researchers found was that<br>those who had very high density writing<br>in their in their essays were much less<br>likely to develop Alzheimer's disease in<br>their old age compared to those who had<br>very low linguistic density in their<br>essays<br>so that gives a sign that maybe<br>education or some other factors<br>associated with good brain performance<br>might we might give some resilience<br>uh to the effects of<br>um the possible Alzheimer's disease<br>developing<br>and one of the really interesting things<br>was that even for those women who had<br>very good brain function<br>um in their later life<br>many of them actually had brains that<br>were populated quite a lot with those<br>amyloid plaques I was telling you about<br>so they had the pathological signs of<br>disease but they didn't have the<br>cognitive dysfunction an impairment<br>again suggesting that they had some kind<br>of resilience to the Pathology even<br>though that it was already developing in<br>the brain so they were able to live<br>longer with Better Lives despite the<br>Insidious pathology that was developing<br>so that gave us hope that we can Target<br>brain resilience and building what is<br>called cognitive Reserve to promote a<br>longer and better life<br>so the idea here is that a person with<br>lower Reserve<br>as the pathology develops tips over into<br>cognitive decline in dementia sooner<br>than a person with high cognitive<br>Reserve who may tip over a bit later at<br>the later stage of pathology and takes<br>longer to reach that dementia stage<br>so we've been working on this idea<br>that we should try to increase increase<br>the amount of a particular therapeutic<br>neuroprotective protein in the brain<br>that we've been working on actually to<br>with this kind of aim in mind for the<br>but the problem of course is that how do<br>you get a neuroprotective protein<br>increase in the brain and if you're just<br>going to kind of give it as a like a<br>drug to a person how are you going to<br>get that across the blood-brain barrier<br>because proteins not like the cross the<br>blood brain barrier<br>so that's a significant issue in turn to<br>develop a treatment out of a possible<br>therapeutic protein<br>so here's the solution<br>and that is to try to harness the gene<br>therapy approach to produce a long-term<br>fix to problems in the brain<br>so how does that work well you begin<br>with a virus now this may sound very<br>counter-intuitive having been in the<br>being in the middle of a pandemic or the<br>back end of a pandemic where we've all<br>learned a little bit about viruses and<br>how bad they are<br>and how they have Spike proteins that<br>get the viruses into the cells and of<br>course the viruses replicate they end up<br>destroying cells and destroying function<br>because they've been so<br>hyper um kind of<br>reproduced inside the cell but the thing<br>is you can you can harness this you can<br>take advantage of what we call the virus<br>envelope where the virus capsid you can<br>take out the DNA the harmful DNA that's<br>in the virus and you can put into the<br>virus envelope the DNA that you do want<br>to be there then that you want to go<br>into cells and be reproduced there and<br>let the cell's own Machinery make more<br>of this therapeutic protein that you're<br>trying to um trying to amplify into the<br>tissue<br>so this is a very common technique now<br>both research and it's been also now<br>being looked at more and more in terms<br>of therapy for all kinds of disorders<br>where<br>uh adding getting therapeutic genes into<br>cells may be helpful<br>so um so we've taken this approach as<br>well and we started by<br>uh intracranial injections into animals<br>modeling Alzheimer's disease into the<br>brain region called the hippocampus it's<br>one of the areas of the brain that is<br>impaired quite early in the Alzheimer's<br>disease process<br>and is associated with memory deficits<br>like spatial memory deficits and so<br>forth so as a good Target<br>as a for a proof of principle study that<br>maybe this kind of approach might be<br>helpful<br>so to do this it joined up with the<br>virus and gene therapy expert at<br>University Professor Stephanie Hughes in<br>the biochemistry Department<br>again working with our team members Lucy<br>and Bruce and also again our Guru Warren<br>tape and biochemistry<br>we brought in a mouse model of<br>Alzheimer's disease where they've been<br>given human genes associated with a<br>familial form of Alzheimer's disease<br>here's the shine in the hippocampus lots<br>of plaques amyloid plaques that are<br>shown in the brain<br>and<br>um so researchers in our Labs especially<br>noting here at Connie Chan who is a<br>master's student was looking in as one<br>measure the ability of the brain to<br>produce neurogenesis as adult mice in<br>other words build new cells generate new<br>brain cells nerve cells in the brain<br>and you can see in the control mice<br>there's a certain amount of in each dot<br>is actually the data from a single Mouse<br>you can see that compared to the control<br>wise the Alzheimer's mice have a much<br>lower rate of neurogenesis compared to<br>the controls<br>now if we inject a single injection in<br>this case nine months of age and then<br>study three or four months later you can<br>see that this ability to produce nerve<br>cells is almost completely rescued by<br>giving the virus with the therapy<br>protein into the tail vein so then just<br>circulates through the body and into the<br>brain and at a disability able to rescue<br>this neurogenesis function<br>perhaps more importantly it was also<br>able to rescue a memory deficit as shown<br>by ability10 during her PhD studies<br>so this is what we call a water maze<br>where the animals have to swim around<br>and navigate<br>around in a pool of water to find a<br>submerged platform where they could rest<br>on<br>and<br>um using the cues around the room they<br>can eventually go<br>um faster and with the shorter swimming<br>distance to get to that submerged<br>platform<br>the Alzheimer's mice are very poor at<br>this task but when they're given the<br>gene therapy into the hippocampus<br>they're just about back at control<br>levels so that was very promising<br>results<br>from that study but of course we're not<br>wanting to execially inject in the brain<br>we want to actually<br>um I say check the tailbone the X<br>ejected in the brain for these<br>particular studies so now we that was<br>proof of principle that gene therapy<br>might work over a period of time now we<br>need to be able to do it in the<br>periphery<br>so this involves<br>in this case for these mice injecting<br>into the tailbane<br>and we had to find well we had the<br>problem that these viruses were working<br>with didn't cross the blood-brain<br>barrier either<br>but more recently we found<br>um they've been developed versions of<br>these virus envelopes that is able to<br>actually get across the library and into<br>um into the cells so I took advantage of<br>one of those and did a study<br>um<br>beginning with Sophie Matheson during<br>her PhD and then Emily who's just her<br>own PhD looking at the ability of the<br>peripheral gene therapy<br>with this therapeutic protein to rescue<br>um uh the disease in these mice and if<br>we look at the amount of area that's<br>covered with plaques in a six-month-old<br>Mouse compared to a nine-month-old Mouse<br>you can see the plaque area increases<br>quite dramatically over that three-month<br>period<br>the mice that I've been given the gene<br>therapy have a much lower rate of plaque<br>development compared to um the untreated<br>mice that's in the hippocampus and if<br>you look in the cerebral cortex<br>they see the same kind of trend where<br>there's the increase in plaque load in<br>the nine month old mice compared to six<br>months and that's basically completely<br>stopped by the um the mice that have<br>so<br>um this looks promising<br>um still this particular virus although<br>it can cross the blood-brain barrier<br>doesn't do it in primates so now if<br>we're going to think about humans we<br>need to find a a virus envelope that can<br>cross the low brain Berry and primates<br>one of those has now been developed and<br>so we've just started a full trial uh<br>using this new virus capsid<br>um to kind of see if we can get all<br>these bits and pieces put together from<br>these preliminary studies behavioral<br>Improvement plaque Improvement<br>reducinger inflammation<br>brain plasticity rescue and so forth<br>so the hope is then that more<br>neuroprotective proteins in the brain<br>will give more brain resilience more<br>cognitive Reserve reduce pathology and<br>so we think we're on a good track and<br>um yeah we're going to keep working on<br>this see how far we can get<br>so to conclude basically with what you<br>can do then what we can do<br>and working together we want to be able<br>to add life to years and I think we want<br>to get to that that golden stage where<br>we have an enjoyable later part of our<br>lives with good brain health<br>so I want to thank all the the funders<br>um particularly the HR City health<br>research Council and brain research New<br>Zealand Center of research Excellence<br>when I was when I was around so your tax<br>dollars we're helping with that but also<br>those of you who have been donating to<br>the neurological Foundation anatomical<br>Medical Research Foundation have also<br>helped in supporting parts of our work<br>and also again I just want to thank the<br>University of otago foundation trust for<br>the people who have donated to the<br>particularly the um<br>the blood tests work that's been ongoing<br>and I just want to say and also I want<br>to thank people here some of them not<br>all of the team but here's some we did<br>give ourselves a little bit of time off<br>from time to time<br>um so yeah I want to thank thank the<br>team of course all the participants who<br>are in the blood test study too of<br>course<br>so for those of you who might be<br>thinking how you might be able to help<br>more well you can support brain health<br>research okay<br>um you can go to this website uh for the<br>alumni development office and you can<br>specify any any support that you might<br>want to be able to help us given that<br>you know<br>research funding for this kind of work<br>is difficult to get to be honest so<br>we're we're we're just getting along<br>actually with our work<br>um so you can specify the work goes to<br>the National effort and the altario<br>brain project for Alzheimer's research<br>at otago and you can be assured that 100<br>of your donations directed or you can<br>contact the development office by email<br>and and talk through most of you which<br>is as you as you may wish<br>so with that I think I'll stop<br>um I'll probably set enough I'm very<br>happy to answer questions I hope you<br>feel that actually there is hope despite<br>the extreme Challenge of any brain<br>disease actually and there and<br>Alzheimer's disease in particular I<br>suppose but they're all difficult ones<br>uh but we are making progress even here<br>at otago just as there's progress<br>elsewhere in the world but we have we<br>think we have some unique ideas that<br>actually make may take us quite a way<br>so thank you very much for your<br>attention and um look forward to hearing<br>what you all think and what questions<br>you might have<br>thank you Cliff that was um it's<br>fascinating quite interesting the um<br>extent of which we can um<br>go to provide some some results really<br>so um how long do you think it would<br>take for gene therapy to be an<br>alternative<br>um<br>um you know option viable option to<br>fight Alzheimer's and just science<br>before we answer questions reminder<br>anyone here if you'd like to ask a<br>question please type it into the Q a<br>button at the bottom and then we can ask<br>um so it's a good question and it's a<br>little bit outside my comfort zone<br>because I've never been involved in any<br>uh commercial activity or trials myself<br>but um I think the first thing we have<br>to do is<br>um this complete this study that we've<br>just started with the new virus capsule<br>that we know Works in primates so if we<br>get good results with that then I think<br>we'll get a lot of interest from<br>um various companies to help us push<br>that out into some kind of clinical<br>trial there are Gene therapies for other<br>things other diseases around<br>um<br>and<br>so there is there are Pathways<br>um<br>but<br>um we're in we're in contact with otago<br>Innovation and with the you know getting<br>advice on how to how to navigate that<br>that system going out and trying to get<br>either a patent or some other way<br>forward to kind of test the gene therapy<br>but it's um you know<br>it's it's not trivial in the sense that<br>you are changing the way in which brain<br>cells operate so you want to make sure<br>that you only really do it for people<br>who have clearly have the disease but<br>not so far along that you've got too<br>much damage already and that's where<br>having a good screening test is also<br>important so I don't want to put years<br>on it but<br>I'd like to think that<br>yeah I don't think I should put years on<br>it but it's not in the immediate future<br>right but I'd like to think that it's<br>not in the distance future either I<br>think all going well you know yeah it's<br>a few years away okay what about Cliffs<br>that blood tests the blood test that you<br>can take that shows you're predisposed<br>to getting Alzheimer's<br>um it's readily available in other<br>countries is that something you can get<br>well<br>um<br>there are blood tests that have been<br>licensed right<br>um there is you might say academic<br>debate about how good they are<br>so I'm not aware of I'm not aware of any<br>um<br>commercially or clinically available<br>blood tests that are being used in New<br>Zealand but having said that I'm not a<br>clinician myself and so I may not know<br>all the all the story<br>um but there's<br>um<br>yeah I think there's a bit of<br>development work still to be done that<br>we're trying to find support for for our<br>test yeah and uh really it comes down to<br>matching up against these tests the<br>thing is thing is this these tests are<br>not 100 perfect so even if you got a<br>result on the test you're not<br>necessarily in the clear or you're and<br>you're not necessarily you know<br>um you might have the disease but if it<br>shows signs that you might have the<br>disease it would give give you um the<br>clinic your clinicians the directive to<br>kind of explore this further for you and<br>to try to get alternative methods to<br>confirm a diagnosis I don't think they<br>you wouldn't want to use these blood<br>tests alone to give you a diagnosis<br>they're not 100 yeah all right thank you<br>uh we do have some questions here so how<br>uh well they're very important and in<br>fact um I've just spoken about quite a<br>few and we spoke about<br>um all these health<br>healthy ways of living<br>and um and being and from both diet<br>exercise Social connections and so forth<br>these are all these are all modifiable<br>um risk factors such as<br>um cardiovascular problems through<br>because of smoking for other issues like<br>diabetes these things that they are<br>controlled or you stop smoking these are<br>very important and in fact there's been<br>quite a bit of research in several<br>Western countries that over the over the<br>last 10 20 years the incidence of<br>Alzheimer's disease has been going down<br>in terms of at a given age how much of<br>the population is actually showing<br>Alzheimer's disease<br>um so probably there's a lot of<br>self-medication going on through healthy<br>lifestyle interventions Better Health<br>Care better education<br>so that's a positive on the other hand<br>there's some evidence that that might be<br>beginning to reverse because<br>of um I think there's a lot of<br>um obesity coming online that didn't<br>used to be there for example and other<br>things that are actually on the rise so<br>there's a there's sort of conflicting<br>pieces of information but there's no<br>doubt that<br>um uh well I say no doubt the evidence<br>is pointing to a very large important<br>that that a lot of dealing with your<br>modifiable risk factors is hugely<br>important for at least pushing out the<br>onset of your cognitive decline and<br>um and that's going to just as we're<br>trying to do add life to your ears okay<br>another question here do the activated<br>micro glia produce factors that affect<br>the disease<br>yes they do<br>um and like I say they produce these<br>factors because they're trying to deal<br>with the disease so we have a<br>combination of what we call<br>pro-inflammatory<br>molecules and anti-inflammatory<br>molecules and they can produce both and<br>some of the same molecules can do both<br>things so it's a matter of how much and<br>for how long and so this is one of the<br>when this is one of the big things that<br>um<br>is contributing greatly the<br>neuroinflammation is contributing<br>greatly to disease amplifying what other<br>problems the brain has whether it's the<br>blood supply is not good enough you have<br>too many plaques or whatever<br>um when they when the microglia are<br>releasing their cytokines as they're<br>called or other factors<br>um when they're doing it for too long a<br>period of time they actually turn into<br>pro-inflammatory and aggravate the<br>disease so you know you need to have the<br>microglia because<br>a normal kind of shorter term disease<br>conditions or injury conditions they do<br>a great job<br>um but when they're chronically<br>activated then it becomes an issue and<br>this will be true for other parts of the<br>body you're probably aware that if you<br>have chronic chronic inflammation in<br>various tissues in the rest of your body<br>that's a bad thing rather than a good<br>thing yeah okay uh there's a question<br>about how specific is this treatment<br>um I'm not sure which treatment might it<br>be useful for other neurological<br>diseases such as Parkinson's<br>yeah good question the uh this<br>therapeutic protein and you'll notice I<br>haven't given you the exact name of the<br>protein particular reasons but um<br>actually yeah so I mean I probably could<br>but I'm just being a bit cautious here<br>um for other reasons but but yes we<br>think that this protein and there have<br>been some studies to say that this<br>protein can actually be helpful for<br>other brain disorders for example<br>um for helping treat stroke or helping<br>uh treat head injuries<br>um Parkinson's disease maybe<br>um<br>we haven't really tested it<br>um in that and no one no one has my<br>knowledge have tested it in that sense<br>but maybe other things like friends or<br>temporal dementia and other forms of<br>brain dysfunction so yeah I think this<br>is a this is a treatment to increase<br>brain resilience and we don't think<br>um of course it takes the evidence to<br>show but we don't think it's specific to<br>Alzheimer's disease that it will be<br>something that could be useful for other<br>disorders as well that's good that's<br>good to hear<br>okay another question does your<br>wonderful neuroprotective molecule<br>reduce neuro inflammation associated<br>with the disease<br>yeah that's something we are currently<br>investigating so<br>um interestingly when we did the studies<br>in the uh with the injections directly<br>into the hippocampus<br>they improve memory they improve brain<br>plasticity but they didn't reduce Plex<br>or reduce the neuroinflammation so again<br>this is a matter of making<br>um making the brain more resilient uh to<br>these to the Pathology<br>but the studies that were done with the<br>peripheral injections into the tail vein<br>um are showing signs of actually<br>reducing the inflammation as well as the<br>plaques which would not be surprising<br>because they sort of go hand in hand but<br>we're still analyzing that tissue this<br>is really a step that's hot off the<br>press so we don't have a complete answer<br>to that yet but it's looking promising<br>in this regard so far<br>okay great<br>another question do<br>non-steroidal<br>anti-inflammatory drugs have any impact<br>on the disease<br>yes that's a good question and it's been<br>around for a while actually<br>um<br>they've been trialled<br>um<br>quite a bit because as you might think<br>that you know you can infer from the<br>question that here's a way of<br>potentially controlling uh inflammation<br>um and I think the evidence has been too<br>ambiguous to say that it's actually a<br>positive thing so<br>um<br>it's not currently recommended it's not<br>been improved approved by the FDA for<br>example for treatment of Alzheimer's<br>disease and so while there may be some<br>benefit<br>um<br>the problem with the general<br>anti-inflammatories is is that<br>um you know you do you do need to have<br>some<br>inflammatory response for just normal<br>healthy brain operations and sort of<br>normal conditions so if you over you can<br>overdo it potentially and uh and you<br>lose the positive functions of these<br>immune cells<br>um and so it's it's a balancing act so a<br>generalized anti-inflammatory may not be<br>the right approach okay good<br>um okay quite a clinical question here<br>the amyloid beta hypothesis has been<br>researched for many years and when many<br>clinical trials not having seen benefit<br>from targeting the amyloid beta better<br>do you still think the amyloid<br>hypothesis holds value or should we move<br>to other avenues for research<br>right I guess it's hey that's that's a<br>that's a very topical question as<br>probably the person asking the question<br>those<br>um it's a very uh<br>well debated topic just at the moment<br>and I think<br>um<br>I think the answer is that amyloid beta<br>is a part of the disease there's no<br>doubt about that I think but it may not<br>be it is probably not the trigger as it<br>were something has to trigger the<br>amyloid plaque development and that's<br>really where we need to be looking and<br>there's various hypotheses about how<br>that works<br>um the amyloid the anti-amyloid<br>strategies may not be working as well as<br>we like because they're they're probably<br>being given too late in the disease and<br>they have some side effects<br>unfortunately<br>um and it may just not be the right<br>strategy these antibody strategies may<br>not be the right ones in some ways<br>that's why we have gone away from trying<br>to Target the amyloid plaques directly<br>but instead it just increasing a general<br>neuroprotective protein so that it's<br>almost doesn't matter what the actual<br>source of the disease is<br>um we can make the brain more resilient<br>to the Pathology<br>so I think it's I think<br>I don't think we need to just say<br>plaques had nothing to do with the<br>disease<br>um but to say that they're the primary<br>cause is probably I'm not looking at the<br>right way either hopefully that answers<br>the question for the okay great all<br>right we've got time for one last<br>question and the question is is would<br>the treatment have application for<br>vascular dementia<br>uh my prediction would be yes well the<br>reasons I've just been<br>um suggesting that we think it's a brand<br>resilience<br>um uh neuroprotection that we're we're<br>providing<br>um<br>I'm not saying that and I hope what I<br>want to make clear is and I'm saying<br>this is going to be a cure for these<br>diseases because they're not directly<br>targeting the disease mechanisms but<br>it's making their brain more resilient<br>to override potentially a variety of<br>different uh disorders so basically<br>delaying how long it takes for the<br>disease to develop before you sort of go<br>past the Tipping Point<br>um and it might be quite a long time we<br>don't know<br>um but it it um it's it's an empirical<br>question and you know and it would take<br>doing these pre-clinical studies in in<br>models of of um of these different<br>diseases to really answer the question<br>so um yeah more work more people more<br>money we can we can get them we can ask<br>that question yeah great<br>lovely okay well I'll just handle the<br>last one comment was great talk thanks<br>Cliff so I just want to Echo that so I<br>want to thank you very much Cliff for a<br>wonderful presentation a lot of food for<br>thought um obviously a lot of things<br>that you can do as a person to<br>um help you know prevent<br>um this as long along with a whole lot<br>of other diseases just a reminder we<br>will have a copy of this presentation<br>available as a recording and my team<br>will send that out to people who are<br>registered for this talk but once again<br>I thank you so much Cliff for your time<br>and your expertise and for a very very<br>interesting presentation thank you<br>thanks and thanks to everyone who turned<br>up it's um it's great to have an<br>audience and to share what we've been<br>doing which is pretty exciting so thank<br>you okay all right and don't forget if<br>you'd like to support Cliff please um<br>there's a donation link on that because<br>yeah as you said research funding in New<br>Zealand is a bit hard to find thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
