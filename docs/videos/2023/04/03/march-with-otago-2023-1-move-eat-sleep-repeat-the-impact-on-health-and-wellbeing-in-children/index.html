um<br>the first in the series of match with<br>otago for 2023<br>um and it's wonderful that we can have<br>Professor Rachel Taylor with us tonight<br>uh just a couple of technical things<br>um if you would like to ask any<br>questions of Rachel at the end of her<br>presentation please use the Q a button<br>which is at the bottom of your screen<br>and please type in your question and<br>then we will make sure that we get to<br>ask Rachel of that we are recording the<br>session so we will be promoting it and<br>distributing it out afterwards via our<br>normal Communications online so you can<br>always listen to it again or share it<br>with some friends<br>so um as I said this is the first of our<br>2023 series of match with otago and we<br>are so excited to have Professor Rachel<br>Taylor with us tonight she's the<br>karatani fellow in early childhood<br>obesity and she's also head of the<br>Department of Medicine and director of<br>the Edgar diabetes and obesity Research<br>Center one of the University's Flags<br>Flagship research centers<br>Rachel is interested in determining how<br>sleep diet and physical activity can be<br>manipulated to a favor to favorably<br>affect body weight throughout the life<br>cycle but particularly in childhood her<br>work consists of observational studies<br>and randomized control trials her<br>current research includes investigating<br>various aspects of children's lives and<br>the impacts over time these include<br>researching sleep habits how solids<br>introduced babies the importance of<br>school play space and how guidance on<br>breastfeeding sleep food and activity<br>assist with development so her title of<br>her presentation tonight is move eat<br>sleep repeat the impact on health and<br>well-being in children and it's over to<br>you Rachel<br>thanks very much Sheila and thanks very<br>much to Daniela and otane for inviting<br>to me to talk to you guys today so<br>Sheila outlined I am really interested<br>how all these lifestyle behaviors how we<br>move how we eat and how we sleep<br>influence predominantly our body weight<br>I really started off as a childhood<br>obesity researcher but more laterally<br>thinking a little more holistically in<br>how they impact wider aspects of health<br>and well-being and children<br>so you can't help if you're a childhood<br>obesity researcher there's often a lot<br>of Doom and Gloom around the state of<br>the nation when it comes to obesity and<br>both children and adults but we actually<br>do have some good news<br>data from our before school chick so<br>almost every child in New Zealand<br>undergoes a check before they start<br>school in which they measure their<br>height and weight as well and in almost<br>all sorry and across the last seven<br>years what we are seeing is declines in<br>the prevalence of obesity and<br>importantly this is a happening in both<br>sectors all ethnic groups all levels of<br>deprivation and across the urban rural<br>divide and so our inequities and<br>childhood obesity at least at this age<br>are decreasing rather than increasing as<br>this happens much around the world now<br>when we think about body weight and<br>behaviors that influence that what we<br>tend to think of is how much we eat and<br>how much we exercise uh or not as the<br>case may be what we really think about<br>is how much we sleep and this is an area<br>that is a nutritionist by training I've<br>become increasingly interested in over<br>the last few years<br>is really strong and really consistent<br>evidence that short sleep increases the<br>risk of obesity in children and I would<br>provocatively argue as much stronger<br>evidence than a lot of the evidence<br>linkings lots of dietary behaviors with<br>obesity for things like fruit and<br>vegetable intake and yet fruit<br>vegetables is always a Cornerstone of<br>obesity print prevention initiatives<br>but just because something is related to<br>another variable isn't really a strong<br>enough evidence when it comes to Weight<br>Management what we need to be able to<br>show is that changing one Behavior<br>actually influences our outcome of<br>interest and so a number of years ago we<br>were one of the first in the world to<br>set up a sleep intervention for the<br>purposes of obesity prevention in<br>children<br>so we managed to convince 800 uh in two<br>pregnant women in Dunedin to enter our<br>two-year prevention of overweight and<br>infancy or POI study half of them<br>received a fairly standard food and<br>activity intervention for the next two<br>years sort of throughout pregnancy and<br>until their infant was two and then half<br>of them got a more novel sleep<br>intervention and just notice here too<br>the different level of contact the Sleep<br>intervention was really brief we got the<br>woman when they were in the latter<br>stages of their pregnancy to come into a<br>group session with their partner if they<br>had one and we really talked to them<br>about what the next few months were<br>going to entail which was essentially<br>that yes they were going to be extremely<br>tired and that getting your infant to<br>sleep can be really hard work but there<br>were things that both they could do and<br>their wider whanau could do to help make<br>that more achievable for everyone<br>we then went into the homes when the<br>babies were three weeks of age<br>individually and we talked to the mum<br>and other caregivers and asked how it<br>was going how sleep was working had they<br>tried this and whether there were any<br>any sort of things that we could help<br>with them in terms of their infant sleep<br>most of those families did not see us<br>again in an intervention since<br>and we then measured the children at the<br>age of two which was the end of the<br>intervention five which was the end of a<br>follow-up and then we've just recently<br>um finished measuring them at 11 years<br>of age<br>and in lots of ways we were quite<br>stunned uh at the results of the study<br>because we were able to show that at<br>both the end of the intervention at two<br>years of age and the end of the<br>follow-up at five years of age the<br>children who had received that really<br>brief sleep intervention and infancy had<br>just half the risk of obesity at five as<br>the children who had not received the<br>interview sleep intervention<br>and these results if you're not familiar<br>with the Obesity prevention literature<br>are really quite astounding because most<br>interventions in the weight management<br>area be they treatment or prevention you<br>can sometimes get a positive effect by<br>the end of your intervention but more<br>often than not that positive benefit<br>diminishes once the intervention has<br>ceased and so it's really unusual to see<br>this sort of pattern that you see here<br>this is the main beta mass index said<br>score which is how we measure weight<br>status in children and the blue was the<br>Sleep group and the red is the non-slip<br>group and you can see that the<br>difference here at two years of age<br>there was a difference but it wasn't<br>very big those differences widened not<br>lessened which is really pretty unusual<br>however Hoy was predominantly undertaken<br>in uh European population and we know<br>that a lot of our sleep guidelines<br>really don't fit the lived realities of<br>mini whanau could be whanau with bigger<br>households who are doing shift work who<br>may have cultural or church<br>responsibilities that keep the families<br>out late at night and so on and so<br>trying to achieve these guidelines for<br>the infants and indeed children can be<br>quite difficult things like baby having<br>their own space to sleep we work with<br>some families and some areas that say<br>that they've had children who have never<br>had their own bed to sleep in<br>sleep spaces should be quiet and warm we<br>know New Zealand has a problem with<br>healthy housing and so that can be a<br>really challenging guideline to be met<br>we currently say that no one US included<br>should actually use any screens in the<br>hour before bed but realistically it's<br>not a guideline that's followed terribly<br>well and there's this real focus in the<br>western literature on routine and<br>regularity that's very time focused<br>having a regular bedtime a regular wake<br>time and sticking to that<br>so that really led us to develop our Moy<br>Moya program which was a maori-led<br>intervention that really tried to<br>harness the power of traditional<br>knowledge around sleep and well-being<br>and whanau really connect our<br>participants to tiamati if they weren't<br>connected or to increase their<br>connection if they already had some<br>connection and to promote better sleep<br>and well-being not just in the mum and<br>the pippy the baby but also in the white<br>a whanau<br>and this is a really interesting project<br>for me I I co-lead this project with my<br>Maori lead Dr Justine Ken with my<br>Pacifica Aid Professor Rose Richards and<br>in many ways I'm the junior if you like<br>in this project and this Mighty LED<br>project<br>and why I find it quite fascinating is<br>because a lot of what our intervention<br>entails has elements of what any sleep<br>intervention around the world has it<br>uses water for instance so have a bath<br>before bed it will talk about stories in<br>things like that but there's also quite<br>a fundamental difference that you can<br>see as both tiny and huge so in muy Moya<br>for instance we use the concept of<br>ritual rather than routine so there<br>still might be some water but not just a<br>bath maybe it's about being out at the<br>ocean or down at the river not just a<br>story maybe there are some Tata some<br>karakia some Audi Audi or some sleep<br>meditation that can be used and these<br>connect our participants back to the<br>almadi as well<br>and most importantly it's not tied to<br>time so it doesn't matter if you are<br>away with family somewhere if you're on<br>the Mirai or you've got an incredibly<br>busy household the time Factor doesn't<br>come into it but the ritual does and<br>it'll be really interesting to see we've<br>currently got 500 families around the<br>country<br>um giving this a go to see what<br>so how on Earth does sleep which let's<br>face it is the ultimate sedentary<br>activity actually reduce the risk of<br>obesity because most of the time you'll<br>hear that being sedentary of course is<br>not good for body weight and there's<br>lots of reasons you only need to think<br>about it yourself when you're a bit<br>tired<br>um doesn't make you less active are you<br>less likely to perhaps finish your<br>popcorn less likely to go to the fridge<br>how does it actually explain the very<br>strong relationship Pursuit that we see<br>between not getting enough sleep and<br>increased body weight<br>well the only way to actually work this<br>out is to actually make children sleep<br>deprived and see what happens we need<br>this experimental evidence to actually<br>give us this proof and so that's what we<br>did so we got 110 children aged 8 to 12<br>years and importantly these guys were<br>good sleepers and I'll explain why in a<br>minute<br>we worked out what their usual bedtime<br>and wake time was and then for a week<br>quite happily they got to go to bed one<br>hour later than they normally did to<br>create a period of sleep restriction and<br>they're not quite so popular was in<br>another week they had to go to bed one<br>hour earlier for a week to try and<br>extend their sleep<br>so that gave us an up to two hour<br>difference in sleep and then we very<br>carefully measured what they ate how<br>active they were and how good they felt<br>now they had to be good sleepers because<br>we were specifically making them not<br>sleep so well so we didn't want to<br>enroll children who were already<br>struggling with their sleep because<br>there's some really serious side effects<br>and the first thing was these children<br>did sleep more when given the<br>opportunity to do so so this just<br>presents the data from the first eight<br>children enrolled in the study and we<br>used actigraphy or a bit like a Fitbit a<br>watch that measures your sleep really<br>accurately to measure their sleep so the<br>green represents their baseline or their<br>usual sleep the yellow represents how<br>much they slept on their sleep extension<br>week and the red their sleep restriction<br>week every single one of these children<br>had met sleep guidelines so<br>theoretically was receiving sufficient<br>sleep but you can see that almost all of<br>them with the exception of the top child<br>there were able to extend their sleep<br>when they went to bed a bit earlier<br>and this is a really important thing<br>about sleep guidelines they're really<br>based on<br>um<br>expert opinion and what we know about<br>how much children sleep rather than how<br>much sleep children need because your<br>sleep need is very individual<br>so what happens when they don't get<br>enough sleep are they less active and we<br>were able to show that they're not and<br>of course when you think about it time<br>happens within a constrained 24-hour<br>window you cannot get more time in the<br>day so if one activity goes down another<br>activity must go up to fill in that<br>24-hour window<br>so on Leverage these kids lost about 48<br>minutes of sleep per night<br>however they also woke up Less in the<br>Night by about eight minutes so in total<br>they gained themselves 56 minutes of<br>time to spend somehow differently that<br>day<br>yes they were more sedentary they spent<br>most of that 36 minutes being more<br>sedentary with an increase of 31 minutes<br>but they were also more not less active<br>by about 25 minutes admittedly most of<br>it was fairly light activity and night<br>nature perhaps plain and things like<br>that with no real difference in their<br>levels of moderate to vigorous physical<br>activity but it didn't make them less<br>active<br>what it did do was very much change uh<br>what and how much they act<br>so this is their energy and taking<br>kilojoules and the Sleep extension<br>condition versus the Sleep restriction<br>condition and then the main differences<br>we saw across these two conditions<br>essentially they ate more food and it<br>was all crappy food they were not<br>pestering mum and dad for more fruit<br>vegetables Dairy Foods or a variety of<br>core Foods it was all the non-core sort<br>of foods your chips biscuits cakes<br>packaged food and so on<br>this was a randomized controlled trial<br>that we were used in an intention to<br>treat so every child was included this<br>in analysis whether they managed to<br>reduce their sleep or not if you<br>restrict it to the two-thirds of the<br>sample that actually did manage to get a<br>difference in their sleep of at least 30<br>minutes a night you can see that all of<br>these differences were magnified so they<br>ate significantly more energy when they<br>were tired it was not from the good core<br>Foods it was all from the non-coor foods<br>the ultra processed foods and the sugary<br>drinks all things that have been related<br>why is that why then that doesn't sort<br>of it answers that they do eat more but<br>it doesn't really answer why they eat<br>more and there's been a lot of interest<br>in the fact that it's all to do with our<br>hunger hormones we have two hormones in<br>our body leptin and ghrelin<br>um and they're involved in our hunger<br>and satiety response and the way you<br>need to measure that though of course is<br>to take blood tests children not<br>surprisingly and not that Keen on blood<br>tests so we wanted to measure whether<br>hunger had changed in these children in<br>a different way<br>so we use this experiment called the<br>eating and the absence of hunger<br>experiment so the kids had been either<br>had their sleep extended or restricted<br>for a whole week we get them in at the<br>end of the week they answered a variety<br>of questionnaires and things like that<br>and then we said hey help yourself to<br>dinner<br>we put out this Buffet meal for them and<br>you can see that there's quite a lot of<br>food there that's actually about 15<br>megajoules that's actually about two<br>days worth of food and why it's<br>important to offer so much in that<br>context is we want to ensure that when<br>they've finished that meal that they are<br>full because what we are wanting to<br>measure in the next step is how much<br>they eat when they we know they're not<br>hungry<br>so then I'm benign to them what comes<br>next is course two and we say hey thanks<br>very much would you like to have some<br>dessert help yourself but we have<br>measured these food items very carefully<br>down to the sort of milligram and we<br>measure them before and after the child<br>has eaten and so how much energy they<br>eat in this step here determines their<br>eating in the absence of hunger that<br>essentially was not different across<br>those two conditions so it didn't seem<br>to be related to their hunger hormones<br>and that certainly is supporting some<br>earlier work also showing that it<br>doesn't seem to have a lot to do with<br>hunger<br>what it has more to do with and this<br>perhaps won't surprise any parents in<br>the audience<br>is their emotions and so there was a lot<br>more eating and less eating in response<br>to their emotions when the children were<br>tired so overall we saw more emotional<br>under eating and more emotional<br>overeating during that sleep restriction<br>week but we also saw some differences<br>according to the weight status of the<br>children<br>so children who were lean<br>um with the experiment tended to show<br>more emotional under eating and more<br>food fussiness when they were tired so<br>that we they were less likely to eat uh<br>overall whereas children who were<br>overweight tended to show less satiety<br>responsiveness so this is the ability to<br>stop when you're full and they were<br>faster at eating so they ate their food<br>faster when they were tired and eating<br>faster has also been associated with<br>body weight in children so this was just<br>an exploratory analysis but it provides<br>some interesting suggestions for what<br>might be producing the increase in food<br>that we see<br>other suggestions for the mechanism is<br>simply a time if you've got an extra<br>hour in your day you've got an extra<br>hour to go to the fridge and some of<br>those studies do show that the extra<br>energy is eaten in the evening more than<br>spread throughout the day so that's got<br>some validity as well<br>this was one of the results that I<br>thought was the most interesting and in<br>some ways the most worrying I feel like<br>so what we asked the kids to do at the<br>end of each of those weeks was do a<br>questionnaire that measured their<br>well-being so how well they felt<br>physically psychologically how well they<br>got on with the appearance their friends<br>and how well they did at school<br>and what we were able to show here was<br>that even one not one week of getting<br>about 40 minutes less sleep a night<br>significantly reduced their physical<br>school and total well-being and again<br>when restricted to those kids who had<br>met that 30 minute a night difference<br>you also saw their peer relationships<br>were adversely affected whether this<br>actually continues and happens long term<br>this study doesn't answer because it was<br>a mechanistic study trying to determine<br>sort of why not getting enough sleep<br>might lead to an increased risk of<br>overweight in children it wasn't a<br>long-term intervention sort of seeing if<br>you change sleep what happens to diet<br>so one of the big areas of course that<br>receives a lot of teaching uh just in<br>general but also when it comes to sleep<br>as thinking of screen use and how screen<br>use may impact sleep in children<br>and now screen use is not necessarily<br>new and in some people you might argue<br>what sort of levels of research or<br>evidence do we need this is the CEO of<br>Netflix who was quoted as saying we<br>actually compete with sleep and we're<br>winning so it's well known if you like<br>but worries about sleep and technology<br>or technology in general I should say<br>have actually been around for some time<br>so no locks will keep this Intruder out<br>nor can parents shift their children<br>away from it and this major concern was<br>in relation to the dastardly radio<br>introduced into the 1930s so parents<br>have been worried about these child<br>distractions for some time<br>so we have quite a bit of evidence in<br>the literature suggesting that screen<br>time is not good for sleep but<br>essentially what almost every study has<br>used to measure screen time in children<br>is either self-report by the children<br>how much they say they spend on their<br>screens or asking the parents about<br>screen time in children<br>now I'm a parent of three teenagers I'm<br>sure there are many parents out in the<br>audience there I wonder if you think<br>your own children would be very accurate<br>either intentionally or unintentionally<br>at measuring how much true screen time<br>they truly have<br>and simply put it's a lot more<br>complicated than it used to be in terms<br>of a setting screen time gone are the<br>days of having a single device in the<br>household which only had children's<br>programming on for a limited number of<br>hours screen time today is complex it's<br>rapidly changing and it's often uses<br>multi-devices like you see here this is<br>how children use their screens in<br>today's world do you think any child has<br>the ability to accurately record that in<br>a questionnaire type situation<br>was it important because you probably<br>think particularly if you're a parent of<br>older children we're not they're not<br>calling out to you at night you probably<br>think they actually sleep okay<br>we have a lot of measurements using<br>ectography so as I mentioned they're the<br>sort of Fitbit like devices the watches<br>that you wear around your wrist or hip<br>and they measure sleep really from an<br>absence of activity they actually show<br>us pretty clearly there are a lot of<br>children out there who are not sleeping<br>well so these are the data you get from<br>a Fitbit type device from between over a<br>24-hour period so the blue refers to<br>activity this is when you're moving the<br>green refers to their sleep so this<br>child went to sleep at 2am<br>and they woke up at 8am<br>um so they got just under six hours of<br>sleep per night I doubt the appearance<br>this is an 11 year old child on a school<br>night I doubt mum or dad thought they'd<br>gone to sleep at 2am<br>or you might have a child during the<br>school holidays they've gone to sleep<br>here at midnight and they've woken up<br>close to 10. that sounds like a<br>fantastic sleep who wouldn't want to<br>sort of almost 10 hour sleep but these<br>periods Punk here are showing you<br>actually how long they're awake in the<br>night and you can see that this child<br>had a very disrupted sleep so they<br>weren't actually getting any more sleep<br>than the previous child in that example<br>and so that really led to our beard<br>study<br>time and electronic devices study and<br>we're just currently analyz<br>but we were really interested in knowing<br>does screen use actually impair<br>adolescent sleep at the moment we tell<br>adolescents they should have no devices<br>for at least an hour before bed they<br>should not have any devices in their<br>bedroom and they should have less than<br>two hours per day there's Fat Chance of<br>any of that probably working in the real<br>world<br>so what we did uh was actually tried to<br>measure their screen time much better<br>and essentially what we got the kids to<br>wear were these police body cameras so<br>they worn in a harness around the chest<br>they face outwards and what you see was<br>the images that I showed you before of<br>that very interactive screen time we<br>were also interested however in the<br>sneaky screen use and so we also set up<br>one of these infrared cameras in the<br>child's bedroom overnight which captured<br>a reasonably alarming level of overnight<br>screen use in these children with some<br>children having tens if not hundreds of<br>notifications throughout the night<br>this will give us a really good measure<br>of screen time we measured their health<br>and well-being and we measured their<br>dietary intake and interestingly we've<br>also collected measures of their heart<br>rate 24 7.<br>so 80 kids wore these cameras for three<br>hours before they went to sleep each<br>night and then overnight in their rooms<br>for four nights over the course of the<br>week<br>and so we've got repeated nights where<br>we can see if they're doing different<br>activities prior to being on different<br>days how it impacted sleep that night so<br>it's a really powerful study design<br>why we're interested in heart rate as<br>partly to look at the content or the<br>level of excitation if you like of the<br>gaming it could be that something like<br>Snapchat is fairly benign they often<br>just scroll through the video sorry<br>scroll through their um snaps it's not<br>often that interactive but maybe it is<br>maybe they get a bad snap or a good snap<br>that creates a bit of excitement so<br>we'll have these heart rate data to<br>actually give us another level of<br>information about the sort of screen<br>time that these children are actually<br>doing<br>so from the video data that I showed you<br>we can actually determine these nine<br>different activities we can see if<br>they're watching something if they're<br>multitasking if they're just browsing<br>doing educational activities gaming<br>social media listening messaging or<br>reading and interestingly we can<br>actually tell and when I say we I'm in<br>Brad and Shea two PhD students who have<br>done a phenomenal amount of work to<br>determine this can actually discriminate<br>between these nine activities even when<br>the camera doesn't actually show the<br>device screen that the children are<br>using because over time they've learned<br>the different hand and finger movements<br>are very indicative of the particular<br>program that they're using<br>surely there's an easy way of getting<br>than getting kids to wear police body<br>cameras you might say that sounds<br>relatively invasive<br>um you don't want Dad running down the<br>hallway to the bathroom<br>um Sam's clothing if you like if<br>someone's wearing a police body camera<br>in the house<br>um and for those of you with an Apple<br>device look on your Apple it's got a<br>screen time<br>um app you can see how much screen time<br>you had each day you could sort of see<br>when you're having it you can see how<br>long you're spending on it but we want<br>to know about screen time just prior to<br>Bid And so this information isn't<br>actually available this is proprietary<br>data from Apple that you can't actually<br>get hold of so you'd be trying to<br>estimate these sorts of things from<br>these pretty pictures<br>unless you actually do research at<br>Stanford University in the States<br>because they have done a deal with Apple<br>whether they've got a number of people<br>and every five seconds it takes a<br>screenshot of your phone and shows you<br>exactly what you're up to<br>during the course of the day and that<br>from that they're actually going to be<br>able to determine quite a lot of screen<br>time that sounds pretty cool and it is<br>pretty cool but when it comes to<br>teenagers even every five seconds is not<br>enough these kids rapidly change what<br>they're doing within that five second<br>thing and they don't just use their<br>phones you can see that they were often<br>on their camera other devices<br>multitasking and so on so this is going<br>to be probably okay for adults that miss<br>a lot in the teenage sense<br>so what we hope bed will actually tell<br>us is whether the different devices make<br>an impact maybe phones<br>um aren't very good but maybe watching<br>tally before beard isn't actually too<br>big a deal<br>maybe it depends what you're doing so<br>maybe Snapchat's okay but for anyone<br>interested in gaming and The Last of Us<br>and fighting cordyceps maybe that and<br>all the adrenaline that gets going is<br>going to be bad for sleep<br>maybe it doesn't matter what you're<br>doing but it's a win that's important<br>and that's really tied up with the view<br>that if you have the screen time too<br>close to bed it increases the blue light<br>it lowers your melatonin and that delays<br>the time sorry extends the time before<br>you can actually get to sleep we'll be<br>able to tell that from the study and<br>nobody in the world's actually done this<br>sort of thing before so we're really<br>hopeful it's going to give us some<br>really useful information both for<br>interventions in the future and for<br>changing sleep guidelines<br>internationally<br>so how else could we improve sleep and<br>youth maybe some of you use the night<br>shift on your Apple phone and the<br>Android's got a similar sort of thing<br>and that's where it supposedly sort of<br>reduces the amount of blue light that's<br>emitted by your device and it should be<br>better for your sleep<br>so they've done a few studies to<br>actually look at this now and this is an<br>example of a group of young adults so<br>for a week they did not use their phone<br>in the hour before bed another week they<br>use their regular phone and another week<br>they put the night shift on their phone<br>you can see that having night shift<br>didn't affect how long it took them to<br>get to sleep how long they slept or<br>whether they woke up in the night and<br>actually a couple of years ago Apple<br>changed their advertising and they no<br>longer advertise night shift is good for<br>sleep<br>and I think one of the biggest just<br>lastly one of the biggest areas in<br>really exciting areas for future sleep<br>interventions and this will please I<br>think almost every teenager out there is<br>talking about delayed school start times<br>so this has been around and the states<br>for quite a while but that's really<br>because they start school dang early so<br>these are data now that are about five<br>six years old but no school in New<br>Zealand starts before 8 30 a.m less than<br>a fifth of American high schools started<br>after 8 30 in that time they start much<br>much earlier than we do so 10 before 7<br>30 a third between 7 30 and 8 and about<br>a third from eight late 30. so quite a<br>lot of work was done at the states at<br>the time shine that if you did delay<br>starting school till at least 8 30 you<br>did see an improvement in sleep academic<br>achievement mental health well-being and<br>a whole variety of things<br>why is it important to change school<br>start times this is actually the best<br>evidence we have I think it's all to do<br>with biological changes that happen in<br>older adolescents so asking a teenager<br>to wake up at 7am is like asking an<br>adult to wake up at 4 00 am I'd be very<br>surprised if any of you including me<br>could get up at 4am very happily five<br>days a week and not be a grouchy pain in<br>the butt getting out the door and it's<br>all to do with that biological shift in<br>their circadian rhythms for reasons<br>still really unknowing and sort of mid<br>to late adolescence they get a shift in<br>their body clock that just means they're<br>not tired at night time like younger<br>children and adults do they need to<br>sleep later which means they also need<br>to get up later but our social norms<br>prevent that from actually happening so<br>why don't we just lick teenagers start<br>school later there's a lot of perceived<br>barriers people worry about school<br>transport getting the rest of their<br>whanau to school after school jobs<br>before school sport after school sport<br>traffic a whole variety of things<br>um and in the states a lot of the um<br>resistance was really about the school<br>transport system so in the states almost<br>every child goes to school on a school<br>bus it's a very big part of their system<br>they did an economic analysis to see<br>what would happen What would be the cost<br>of every school in the country delaying<br>their school start time to 8 30 A.M<br>remember very few schools actually got<br>to that point what they saw was that<br>actually it saved money within the<br>second year of implementation to the<br>tune of about nine billion dollars per<br>year about the same income that Major<br>League Baseball brings into the United<br>States so it was a big deal and it was<br>only on the basis of decreased traffic<br>accidents which are a major side effect<br>of young tired adolescence and increased<br>academic achievement<br>so what people generally say is surely<br>if you let children go to school later<br>they'll just get up later won't they but<br>actually this doesn't seem to happen<br>this has been one of the one of the very<br>few benefits of covert a lot of schools<br>around the world have actually changed<br>how they deliver their curriculums in<br>times of lockdown and so on so this is<br>an example from Croatia where they had a<br>morning school class and an afternoon<br>school class so if you look at their<br>sleep duration on the right here the<br>children who went to afternoon school<br>got almost two hours more sleep every<br>single day than the children who went to<br>morning school it wasn't because they<br>went to bed later they went to bed a<br>little bit later but they basically<br>slept on a lot longer and those days are<br>a pretty consistent across studies and<br>it's because their bedtime is<br>biologically driven and their wake time<br>so why not start school even later then<br>so as I said the majority of the<br>research has been in that sort of U.S<br>state where they're changing from 7 30<br>to 8 30. we think that school could even<br>change to say around a 10 a.m start but<br>there's not a lot of evidence yet that<br>that's going to have as beneficial<br>effects but we think it will so here's<br>an example from one school school<br>district also overseas that had a<br>natural experiment they had a change in<br>local government essentially so at year<br>one Baseline school start time was ten<br>to nine for various reasons they changed<br>it to 10 AM for two years and then lo<br>and behold change a local government<br>they reverted back to the original<br>so this was the absence due to illness<br>over that time and you can actually see<br>Sharp decreases while they had the<br>latest start time which was returning<br>back to original once they introduced<br>the earlier time and the increases in<br>academic success introduced by that<br>delayed school start time also starting<br>to decline over time<br>so we're really hoping to get this<br>underway and New Zealand at some stage<br>over the next couple of years so we're<br>currently doing a lot of talking uh with<br>children teenagers parents teachers<br>Boards of Trustees principals transport<br>operators sports clubs<br>um everyone that may be potentially<br>affected by<br>um older teenagers having a later school<br>start time so if anyone's interested and<br>seeing those questionnaires adding their<br>points of view please let me know<br>afterwards I can send you the links what<br>we're hoping to do is a step wedge to<br>RCT where we convince six schools so<br>actually try a change to later school<br>start times just for their senior<br>students for a couple of terms and<br>actually determine the effects on health<br>and well-being in these cats<br>so as a nutritionist do I think sleep's<br>the answer I actually do<br>um it certainly has a major role to play<br>in sleep and well-being we know lots of<br>children and not receiving either enough<br>sleep or enough good quality sleep but<br>this is sort of one of the most<br>interesting areas I think so I've been<br>working in dietary<br>um interventions for quite a long time<br>and there's often a lot of angst around<br>dietary interventions with parenting<br>whereas parents are very receptive to<br>interventions that might improve the<br>Sleep health of their children<br>I think it's got really interesting<br>ability to potentially influence diet<br>and physical activity in children as<br>well as having the multitude of other<br>benefits that good sleep Health has on<br>Mental Health wellbeing and academic<br>performance and a million other things<br>I'd just like to acknowledge my<br>wonderful collaborators who have<br>contributed in many many ways to all<br>those projects that I've shared with you<br>tonight and also our funders thanks so<br>much<br>right okay we've got time for some<br>questions so we've got a couple of<br>questions here so um<br>right sure one of the questions is do<br>you think the some of these results that<br>you have um translating to reasons for<br>obesity in adults<br>yes um a lot of the literature applies<br>to adults as well very much so<br>um and so the link between short sleep<br>duration and body weight is not quite as<br>strong in adults as it is in children<br>but it definitely still exists<br>um the employ the studies like the one<br>where we made the children sleep<br>deprived they also show similar dietary<br>effects in adults so adults tend to eat<br>more tends to be the less healthy<br>options and nobody the physical activity<br>side hasn't been investigated<br>um as much but yes pretty much the same<br>stuff applies for adults as it does for<br>children okay<br>so just a reminder the people that are<br>here listening if you want to ask a<br>question please type it into the Q a<br>which is the little button next to the<br>shared screen on the bottom of where<br>you're watching<br>um so another question is<br>um well we've had a comment great<br>presentation thank you very much do you<br>think daylight savings has an influence<br>too should we be sleeping according to<br>Daylight Darkness patterns<br>yeah there's certainly a lot of a lot of<br>interest in daylight saving and the<br>potential um effects that it may have<br>um because certainly getting natural<br>light<br>um in the morning or artificial light to<br>some degree but natural light preferably<br>is actually important for waking the<br>body up for getting into the sort of<br>wake cycle and then getting into the<br>dark phase again and so Daylight Saving<br>does actually disrupt that a little bit<br>whether it's as important I think the<br>way we live our lives a bit artificially<br>in terms of the screens and the lights<br>and all those other things we have a<br>bigger impact than Daylight Saving but<br>it's certainly a part of the puzzle as<br>well I know lots of parents of young<br>children always hate the start of<br>daylight saving they we say it's an<br>issue with getting their children to bed<br>and things that's right it does take a<br>while to learn we actually adapt to our<br>sleep if it works well quite quickly<br>okay<br>so um what would be the one thing that<br>you would suggest to parents to improve<br>the health and well-being of their<br>children<br>well I think it would be sleep I think I<br>think we need to pay more attention to<br>sleep<br>yeah the poor cousin really so to speak<br>we think of the diet and activity and<br>the whole variety of other things and<br>yet I think any parent out there knows<br>that if their child sleeps well<br>everything else sort of tends to follow<br>generally speaking and you know that<br>yourself if you wake up having had a bad<br>sleep the day's pretty tough whatever<br>else<br>um and so I think that applies to all<br>and so trying to create an environment<br>that you know that promotes good sleep<br>as much as humanly possible is<br>beneficial<br>thank you we've got a couple more<br>questions so there are lots and lots of<br>students married to students who study<br>during night hours and have less sleep<br>so how can this affect their health you<br>know it's a you know it's what you do<br>when you're trying to pass or get exams<br>or you've got a lot of study load yep<br>yep so in the ideal world what we should<br>uh depending on there at their UNI<br>schedule of course is maybe they should<br>actually sleep in in the morning<br>um and so what happens is they might<br>pull an all-nighter to get a particular<br>assignment in<br>um and then hopefully they can catch up<br>on that sleep<br>however<br>sort of having having a big difference<br>in the amount of sleep you get between<br>the weekends and the weekdays is<br>actually not good for health either it's<br>what we call a social jet lag so when<br>you're sort of having to catch up on<br>your sleep in the weekends so it's a bit<br>of a catch-22 because if you have a bit<br>of a sleep deprived child or young adult<br>because they've been working or up for<br>school or whatever all week<br>you want to let them sleep on and the<br>weekend to catch up on their sleep but<br>that sort of big difference<br>um in that can actually create some<br>health effects as well so it's a bit of<br>a balance between uh trying to encourage<br>a bit of regularity or a bit of routine<br>sorry ritual<br>um but also letting them catch up where<br>go<br>I was just gonna say your body does um<br>basically sleep you will sleep<br>eventually if you like the Sleep<br>pressure in our body builds up so you<br>just have to sleep it's a sort of<br>biological need to sleep so that does<br>kick in eventually okay can you<br>elaborate on what are what rituals we<br>should or can do before sleep one of<br>them you've said about is no screen time<br>within at least an hour before you sleep<br>is there anything else yep so we know<br>that we know that a bath or a shower is<br>actually good for Sleep um it helps with<br>our body temperature which puts it in a<br>place where it likes to go to sleep<br>um relaxing activities<br>um preferably non-screen ones although<br>like I say the screen information is<br>based on really crude data and we're<br>really hoping that bed study will give<br>us much better ideas because it could be<br>that some screen time is fine which is a<br>lot more palatable to the public if they<br>know which screen time things are good<br>and which ones maybe not so good<br>um uh so sort of quiet time things that<br>relax people some people like meditation<br>some people listen to a sleep story<br>avoiding heavy exercise avoiding alcohol<br>avoiding caffeine some of those sort of<br>standard things too close to bed yeah<br>what are the effects of having daytime<br>naps you know you always talk about<br>having a net in it yeah<br>yeah but it's a pretty fond Nets mostly<br>book experts think that naps are<br>actually really a really good thing and<br>when you think about a lot of the world<br>lives that way in fact I think we<br>actually were born sort of having quite<br>a diurnal sleep pattern so that we<br>should sleep twice a day not once a day<br>like we tend to in Western societies so<br>if you're someone who can nap and who<br>enjoys a nap and feels good after a nap<br>then it would generally be recommended<br>um they do say not long for longer<br>though than about 20 minutes any longer<br>than that might impact your night's<br>sleep but if you get a good 10 15 Nano<br>napping then go for them okay<br>if you have an older teenager who<br>prefers being up all night and then<br>wanting to sleep during the day should<br>you be worried should you be concerned<br>yeah so it's only it's only um a short<br>phase of life if you like so it doesn't<br>it depends of course on how different<br>children<br>um mature and things like that but it's<br>only really in the sort of last couple<br>of years of school in general that this<br>um sort of thing hits and then into sort<br>of early adulthood so say 16 to 22<br>something like that that's that's pretty<br>broad or 25 that's where this biology<br>seems to change<br>um personally I think if they can if<br>they can't go to sleep at night and they<br>have the ability to sleep in a bit the<br>next day then that's what they should do<br>because it'll probably improve their<br>health and well-being a lot because they<br>will be getting sufficient sleep<br>as they have to get up for certain<br>activities like most of us do then it is<br>a matter of where possible trying to<br>perhaps bring that sleep a little bit<br>earlier but within reason because you'll<br>know if you cannot go to sleep you can't<br>go to sleep and if they buy it logically<br>uh designed that way yeah you're going<br>to hit a brick wall<br>okay<br>great all right well they seem to be all<br>of the questions that we have oh no<br>sorry a couple more popping into the<br>screen so um<br>do you have a view on the use of<br>melatonin to Aid sleep<br>yeah well certainly the studies I mean<br>it varies but from person to person like<br>anything out there<br>um but for some people melatonin works<br>well and for others it's um it doesn't<br>seem to be effective but in general<br>melatonin can be a useful sleep aid for<br>people<br>okay great it seems to be more and more<br>sleep aids being advertised with all of<br>these all the nutrition firms and things<br>it seems to be the thing that people are<br>trying to to take a pill to help them<br>sleep yeah I mean you know the the<br>um positive what's the you know positive<br>view of that I guess is that people are<br>recognizing the importance of sleep a<br>bit more perhaps so while popping a pill<br>isn't necessarily the best answer uh<br>yeah you know at least sleep has been<br>valued okay I think one of the big ones<br>is magnesium isn't it magnesium sleep<br>it's become really popular in the last<br>couple of years<br>um okay we've got a question here I<br>noticed I'm a night owl in general but<br>due to work demands I have to get up<br>early for work and that becomes a<br>routine since I have the flexibility to<br>start my work earlier or later should I<br>change to start later and sleep more in<br>the morning or keep the current routine<br>and so we can train our bodies to some<br>degree and so like I said so it's so<br>kids we want to go to sleep early it is<br>this sort of period and later at lessons<br>early adulthood we've drive to go to bed<br>later and then we actually return to<br>wanting to go to bed a bit earlier but<br>we do have night owls and we do have<br>morning Larks if you have the ability to<br>start later and you feel better if you<br>slept in later then yeah I would go for<br>it if you feel that it doesn't make a<br>difference or your body has some has now<br>just adapted to to getting up earlier<br>then maybe there's no need to change but<br>I would work out what's what's best for<br>you okay<br>can the biological and physical features<br>specific to obesity affect the quality<br>of sleep you know it's quite a vicious<br>circle<br>um<br>yeah I think it can can't it yes so it<br>definitely goes both ways yeah so<br>certainly the the the relationship is<br>probably strong well the relationship is<br>stronger going from poor sleep to an<br>increased risk of overweight but it does<br>certainly go the other way when you get<br>to people who have sleep apnea so to see<br>that there is the point where you do<br>have um difficulty sleeping your Airways<br>get compressed during the sleep and it<br>wakes you up in the night because your<br>body automatically realizes that<br>something's wrong wakes you up and so<br>that constant waking is very bad<br>um for your sleep health so people who<br>are bigger do have an increased risk of<br>sleep apnea so it does go both ways for<br>sure okay<br>um we've got a question about shift work<br>um you know how how do you manage that<br>in regard to sleep and and being uh you<br>know getting regular hours yeah so<br>unfortunately shift work is notoriously<br>bad for lots of aspects of our house<br>unfortunately<br>um it makes sleep tougher uh their<br>dietary intake is often different<br>um not generally as favorable physical<br>activity patterns<br>um Can often be adversely affected as<br>well so strip work is is really hard on<br>our bodies<br>um for sure so it's a matter again at<br>the individual level of people being<br>able to do whatever they can within<br>their own constraints try and maximize<br>their sleep and maximize their diet and<br>their activity and their health in<br>general so if you're a shift worker for<br>instance you might be able to have a nap<br>at some strange hour if that benefits<br>your sleep<br>um so it might be a strange hour for<br>other people who aren't shift workers<br>but if it works within your schedule and<br>helps you then that might be something<br>that you can actually introduce okay<br>all right looks like we just might have<br>time for one more question and it<br>relates to sleep apnea besides the CPAP<br>you know what else can help with sleep<br>apnea obviously one of the things I talk<br>about is losing weight because then you<br>know is there anything else that you<br>know of that<br>uh I'm not asleep<br>um Physicians yeah certainly they're<br>certainly the two<br>um major ones<br>um I might have to get back to you if<br>whoever's asked that they could email me<br>I'll send you some more information but<br>this would be the two major things yeah<br>all right<br>last question<br>um how do you explain ethnic differences<br>in body weight to BMI for you know like<br>Pacifica children's Sleepless and polany<br>children you know is that something you<br>looked at<br>we have done a little bit of uh looking<br>here at ethnicity and so and<br>um sleep patterns across different<br>ethnic groups and yes we actually showed<br>that Pacifica children did tend to have<br>shorter sleep duration<br>um than party High children<br>um and a little bit lower in terms of<br>the Sleep Quality Maori children were a<br>bit in between<br>um a wee bit<br>mixed in terms of the different number<br>of slick variables you can look at<br>um and and I guess that supports the<br>shorter sleep being related to higher<br>body weights that we also see across<br>different ethnic groups it certainly<br>doesn't explain the whole story at all<br>but it may be a contributor yeah great<br>okay well that's the end of the time we<br>have and actually that's the end of the<br>questions that I can see so just want to<br>thank you very much Rachel it's<br>fascinating and<br>um we we don't know you know we don't<br>realize how important sleep is we all<br>know we like sleep<br>but how it actually affects your<br>physical and mental well-being is that's<br>actually great to hear and some of those<br>studies are amazing so um thank you so<br>much for your time tonight and<br>um as we mentioned we will have this<br>recorded<br>um so we will be uh it will be available<br>to be distributed out so thank you once<br>again and thank you everybody who<br>attended I hope you enjoyed it thanks</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
