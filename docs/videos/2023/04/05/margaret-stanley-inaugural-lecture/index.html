tonight QR code my<br>name is John Hoskin I'm the dean of<br>science here at the University of<br>Brooklyn and it's not a great position<br>to welcome you to the university<br>of<br>Stanley<br>however it's an ecologist with a special<br>interest in Urban Ecology<br>the pointy end of the collision between<br>the people and nature she believes with<br>good scientific support but exposure to<br>Nature throughout our wives suspended<br>people to everyone's health and<br>well-being<br>is an increasing disconnect between<br>people in nature around the globe<br>because we've crammed more people into<br>cities<br>Margaret's work is often about<br>unintended consequences of people<br>nature such as a web with Jersey<br>goldbreath on uncritical backyard<br>feeding Birds which has had the<br>unintended Consequence the boosting the<br>population<br>of the fluid species at the experience<br>of paper birds<br>similarly to work on the extended or the<br>Border Police or parents<br>so the danger of their becoming an<br>Invader an endemic invasive species<br>competing with Native bird species for<br>sale<br>whether it's Deluxe of chainsaws<br>resilience to flooding hedgehogs bird<br>feeding light pollution cats artificial<br>grass or weeds Margaret has an informed<br>opinion which can regularly be found in<br>an airport media articles and interviews<br>and venues such as the guardian New<br>Zealand Metropolitan press or Windsor<br>Geo<br>this has led at twice being a finalist<br>for the prime minister's science<br>Communications products<br>I particularly like a perspective on an<br>urban tree Portables she talks about the<br>330 300 room being adopted elsewhere<br>means that everyone should be able to<br>see three trees from their house every<br>neighborhood should have a 30 tree<br>canopy and everyone should live less<br>than 300 meters away from in space it's<br>not a great inspiration<br>so having strong academic impact with<br>their work regularly being found in top<br>venues such as nature ecology and<br>evolution Venus frontiers of ecology and<br>environment and Global changing biology<br>through thatch is also a good impact on<br>policy and Community advice<br>the research is also positively<br>impacting her teaching exemplified by<br>her development of the Masters and bias<br>security and conservation<br>her teaching is nothing surely excellent<br>however it comes from Dominion to the<br>BSC honors and geology at otago her PhD<br>in ecology at Monash<br>ER for six years she will joining the<br>academic style and biological sciences<br>here in Auckland<br>it's like Margaret's going to tell us<br>about<br>future coaches all right<br>and thank you all for braving the<br>traffic to come here tonight to see me I<br>hope at least the food and drink was<br>worth it if nothing else so<br>um for me science and teaching are both<br>team sports and although I'm being<br>individually assessed for my performance<br>I'm here because of a lot of other<br>people so I'm going to be very<br>self-indulgent tonight and use this hour<br>I promise it's not more than an hour<br>to thank those who have helped shape my<br>journey and those who I feel standing<br>beside me<br>so the disclaimer here though is if I<br>forget to mention your name thank you<br>everybody uh now so I've done the<br>disclaimer<br>so<br>um as an aside I am always nagging my<br>students about taking pictures in the<br>field<br>um I have very few photos from my PhD<br>the photo quality in this talk is going<br>to be terrible<br>but I have to live with this so this is<br>in fact a fake photo that was used for a<br>departmental promo during my PhD what<br>I'm doing here is actually extracting a<br>taxidermied Eastern<br>Robin from a Miss net World<br>simultaneously trying to hide the museum<br>tag<br>so I will not stop nagging about taking<br>photos<br>but I do hope that I've at this point<br>I'm perhaps reached the well-baked<br>ecologist stage and that as I age I<br>don't kind of go backwards to the Half<br>Baked but there is quite a lot of time<br>left or perhaps do that so do keep me on<br>track<br>um and I'm sure that Kate has picked out<br>the irony of this title<br>um that well scientists are extremely<br>creative and artistic and do not get<br>enough credit for this unlike my<br>extremely talented post-grade students<br>who can paint and craft and knit and<br>bake the most amazing cakes I can do<br>none of this and certainly no matter how<br>good a cake looks in my head I fail to<br>produce what's in my head so Kate knows<br>about this and I'm going to get this out<br>of the way now so for Kate<br>this is Lucy at age four she is<br>genuinely pleased with this Frozen cake<br>that I decorated<br>even though it's clear to the adults in<br>the room that the snowflakes look like a<br>bird has crept on the cake<br>the irony of which is one of my sisters<br>actually calls me a doctor of bird<br>so it's probably uh quite right but my<br>postgrades genuinely do have that look<br>of fear on their face when I say we're<br>talking about experimental design and I<br>say let's draw a picture shall we so I'm<br>well known for really bad pictures and<br>things got really bad over covert on<br>Zoom whiteboard so we'll try to avoid<br>that tonight<br>but the first people I need to thank is<br>my family and I just want a definitive<br>note here that these hand-me-down<br>clothes were at least 10 years out of<br>date so this is not as old as you<br>perhaps thinking<br>um but<br>um I am the last of seven children and<br>the favorite of course we all know that<br>um but um I think one of the reasons<br>that John's introduction makes me a<br>little squirmy as I stand there is we<br>were taught never to get too big for<br>your boots and never to Skype and that's<br>something we were brought up with which<br>is ironic given the speed at which my<br>parents have pushed their Zimmer frames<br>around the rest home to tell everybody<br>about my promotion<br>but my siblings certainly never get let<br>me get an ego at all or bigger than my<br>boots<br>but I do need to acknowledge my parents<br>for setting me out on this journey both<br>of them they only had a year or so at<br>high school before they were set out to<br>work for their families so education was<br>really really important for them to give<br>us that opportunity<br>so<br>I was reflecting on what makes an<br>academic and many of us are on this 40<br>40 20 model which supposedly adds up to<br>100 but feels like 200 at times<br>um and you know this is what we have to<br>report on for promotion and uh I guess<br>when we can meld those three things<br>together I think that's where we're most<br>efficient and successful in the job is<br>really enjoyable so I'm going to try and<br>touch on a wee bit of all three of those<br>tonight but I have to say that we're<br>trained as scientists to sort of be<br>thrusting to this world of teaching and<br>service is really overwhelming as an<br>early career researcher so I'll have a<br>lot of people to think for that<br>but um uh one thing I'm hoping that will<br>come out as a theme for the talk tonight<br>is uh learning and I got awarded this<br>Peter Ingram Memorial award<br>um just a couple of years into my post<br>grad and I was actually really confused<br>and a bit<br>um befuddled by it because I was just a<br>year or two out of my PhD I just don't<br>want to learn anymore you just want to<br>be at the stage where you know you know<br>stuff and we don't have to constantly<br>learn new things so<br>um I felt a bit sick of it and I got a<br>bit depressed at the fact that I was<br>going to always be learning but then I<br>delved into Peter's life and his<br>philosophy and as I've got older I've<br>realized that we always need to be<br>learning all of the time I really don't<br>want to learn another piece of<br>University software<br>but I'm really hoping that we can spend<br>some time learning on the things that<br>are going to make a difference for our<br>teaching and research but particularly<br>in making that more inclusive and for<br>adding it into the context of society so<br>and to do that I've had to learn a lot<br>from other people so we're going to talk<br>about what people have taught me as the<br>night goes on<br>but the key uh message or theme for<br>tonight is nature connections and that's<br>really one I want to talk about and I<br>really like this figure from the<br>University of Derby which shows our<br>progression with a nature connection<br>and I love sniffing things you can ask<br>my children that I love sniffing things<br>and if I think about where I sit on here<br>with sensors for me it's the smell of<br>thyme you can see the raggedy old time<br>there in the picture in central otago<br>yes it's a weed ironically but for me<br>that brings back childhood memories of<br>camping in central otago might be a<br>sound for you might be cicadas for me<br>it's the sound of the pods on Broom when<br>they start crackling and pop open and<br>the seeds come out so it's things that<br>connect you to Nature that bring back<br>those what people might call Core<br>memories if you've seen the movie<br>um that yeah they're both weeds but you<br>know that was my childhood that was the<br>landscape that I grew up in there wasn't<br>much in the way of native biodiversity<br>so you take what you get and hopefully<br>as you move to finding meaning you can<br>have that compassion to improve the<br>nature around you and to get more<br>biodiversity back<br>as opposed to perhaps listening to old<br>so this and key of science on the<br>benefits of Nature and there's heaps and<br>heaps of research in the last perhaps 15<br>years around this we know that having a<br>10-minute walk in your local Bush patch<br>or Wetland is going to significantly<br>lower your stress levels and your blood<br>pressure among other things compared to<br>walking around in this hard concrete and<br>Lawn environment<br>for me the palm trees set my blood<br>pressure up even higher<br>but the opportunity to connect with<br>nature in cities can be quite difficult<br>for many people and it often depends on<br>our socio-economic status and it's quite<br>damning I think that we know all of<br>these health and well-being benefits of<br>nature connection but the poorest areas<br>of Auckland have the lowest tree canopy<br>and so all of those people are missing<br>out on those health and well-being<br>benefits<br>and during lockdown this came really to<br>the four in our psyche we won't mention<br>the sort of cars that are in this<br>neighborhood but people in this<br>neighborhood were able to go and walk<br>around these tree-lined streets as<br>opposed to people in other neighborhoods<br>and this has happened all around the<br>globe as well<br>so most of new zealanders live in<br>Auckland most of them don't have an<br>opportunity to connect with nature and<br>some members of our community don't have<br>the means to leave the city<br>so I really connected to this uh sober<br>and Gaston framework on these this<br>Extinction of experience<br>so it basically starts here where you<br>lose those opportunities to connect with<br>nature and then you start losing those<br>experiences that we all had growing up<br>with nature and with that loss of<br>experience you also get these health and<br>well-being changes and we know that<br>we're starting to get higher levels of<br>anxiety and depression particularly with<br>City dwellers<br>leads to a lot of emotional changes and<br>attitudinal changes our environmental<br>values which of course can lead to<br>changes in voting but also Behavior<br>changes so where we're perhaps chopping<br>down those trees in our backyard and<br>those behavioral changes lead all the<br>way back up here to loss of opportunity<br>so we have to start breaking that cycle<br>by allowing more opportunities for<br>so what were my first uh nature<br>connections I was very lucky to grow up<br>around<br>otako otago Harbor<br>sadly no YouTube or Tick Tock so we were<br>outside with the neighborhood kids until<br>Dad came to the front door whistled very<br>loudly when it was tea time<br>there wasn't any native species that I<br>can remember now I clearly remember<br>climbing macrocarpa's playing in Scotch<br>Broome you will have similar memories<br>growing up<br>and there wasn't any health and safety<br>either<br>and just to be very clear I'm not<br>wearing a helmet this is my actual<br>and it's mum who for me gave me a lot of<br>those opportunities so those first few<br>memories I have a mum showing me a stick<br>insect in the garden or a frog which is<br>just insane and knowing that she had<br>seven kids she was doing all the cooking<br>and cleaning in a household labor and<br>then when I was just a few months old<br>she worked at the Tanner local Tannery<br>in the evening to supplement a dead<br>salary so the fact that she did these<br>little things that had a really profound<br>effect on me and quite amazing so this<br>is where Imogen must close her ears<br>because I'm going to tell you my one and<br>only biosecurity crime<br>so<br>my brother rescued some baby rabbits<br>from his girlfriends<br>um ex-girlfriend's farm at that point<br>which is ironic given how many rabbits<br>our family shot and ate<br>and Mum got an eye dropper and some milk<br>and we raised these rabbits I think she<br>did it for the younger a couple who<br>hadn't had pets at that point until they<br>got bigger dad lost all sympathy with<br>having wild rabbits in the backyard but<br>mum's soft heart meant that we put the<br>rabbits in a box took it up the road in<br>the van and let them go<br>all right imagine<br>so we've still got work to do 40 years<br>later with stopping people releasing<br>pets so yeah<br>and there's no one from otago Regional<br>Council here so that's all good<br>so most of my Christmas businesses were<br>up in otago in earnsclaw so again those<br>memories those early teacher memories<br>for me it was mum she made uh fishing uh<br>net out of old pantyhose and helped me<br>catch cockapillies in the creek<br>and I found this one and I know mom's<br>going to kill me but I was trying to<br>prove that Mum could feed us wash us<br>clothe us and at the same time she<br>managed to find time to put a hair and<br>curlers and wear this Infamous blue<br>scarf so I know she's going to be mad<br>about that but that's okay<br>um the most commentary of my summer<br>holidays were Willows so again Dad would<br>get us a green sharpened Willow stick a<br>stick of sausage on the end it went over<br>the fire<br>and they were everywhere in Central and<br>ironically of course I went on to study<br>them as an invasive weed so it's about<br>changing and getting compassion and<br>changing biodiversity around us but<br>where we haven't got it then perhaps any<br>nature might do for the instance and of<br>course the first close encounter with<br>opossum was dad taking me to the outside<br>Dunning at one of these places in the<br>middle of the nights<br>but invasive species were so widespread<br>the landscape was so changed that these<br>were the species that actually I formed<br>critical nature connections within my<br>so how did I become a scientist like<br>everybody and I noticed Rochelle said it<br>the other night I thought I wanted to be<br>a vet because I think we knew of like 10<br>jobs that you could do when I was a kid<br>I was incredibly lucky to have the best<br>sixth form or year 12 biology teacher<br>so sue Heath had done a masters in rock<br>green biology<br>so a few things that was my wait what<br>moment what's a rock green what's a<br>masters what's zoology we don't have any<br>zoos in Dunedin it was utterly confused<br>and two things that Sue did<br>um that stand out in my memory<br>um and one was that she had us uh right<br>to dock offices all around the country<br>and ask for them to go outside pluck a<br>bit of Manuka throw it in a envelope and<br>send it back to us and we'd wait for the<br>mail to come in and we would measure<br>Leaf shape and try and correlate it with<br>rainfall and latitudinal gradient and<br>really that must have been quite rare<br>back in those days to do such meaningful<br>science at that age I'm sure my children<br>have done a thousand volcanoes at school<br>so I'm grateful for her<br>she also took the three Keener students<br>so she harnessed our curiosity and saw<br>that we needed opportunities and what<br>she did was she organized for us to have<br>a three-day experience at Portobello<br>Marine Lab with Sally Carson here we are<br>um dissecting a poor beagle shark that<br>some fishermen just rocked up to the lab<br>with<br>um and Cheryl there on the left became a<br>scientist a marine scientist at niwa and<br>she's now does matarangamari at greater<br>Wellington Regional Council so<br>he Sue had a huge impact on us and it<br>was really really pivotal for us I think<br>in our careers and so good teachers I<br>had some terrible teachers but that's<br>why I'm a biologist<br>it's the only time I can say I've ever<br>but then over the summer period after<br>that experience I have the privilege of<br>volunteering at the Marine Lab and the<br>privilege of a small town of knowing the<br>captain of the munator who lived on our<br>side of the harbor so every morning he'd<br>pick us up pick me up from Kerry's Bay<br>and either take me dredging out the<br>heads or take me over to the Marine Lab<br>and back again at the end of the day so<br>the opportunities just piled up for me<br>and that was I guess part of my my<br>privilege in getting<br>um those so again it's people's<br>circumstances<br>I think they do have my mother's fear of<br>open water though because Marine Science<br>was not<br>um to be for me that that's a nice day<br>um I also took a botany paper<br>um Mike Taylor was my first year lab<br>partner so maybe that's what put me on<br>um<br>could it also been the enormous amount<br>of drawing plants that we had to do we<br>know what an artist I am<br>um so botany was not to be so I went to<br>zoology<br>and for my honors I worked on these<br>endangered skinks this is definitely a<br>fishing story The no this big about a<br>foot long one of our largest highly<br>endangered lizards in this beautiful<br>landscape at mcrae's flat<br>my field site wasn't much of a drive<br>from home an hour and a half two hours<br>the slog was getting in to this part but<br>it actually felt like a million miles<br>away it was all these eroded chest tour<br>Landscapes where the tools or the<br>outcrops great refuges for lizards and<br>Falcons and all sorts of rare plants<br>that weren't getting hammered by sheep<br>and Cattle<br>in reality my field site was more like<br>this so it was a working cattle farm it<br>was fragmented my project was looking at<br>the movement of the lizards between uh<br>the the tours and how fragmentation<br>affected that and also looking at the<br>Homing behavior in case one day if they<br>decline too much we had to translocation<br>then that site Fidelity would be a bit<br>um I learned to fish for lizards so you<br>can't dig a pitfall trap into a rock so<br>what we did was we had fishing line<br>which was in a repurposed car aerial and<br>we fished snuck up lassoed the lizards<br>that's just a normal old grass skink in<br>that picture<br>so look new skills lived in Joe Dooley's<br>Hut well I came outside most of the time<br>because this place was humming<br>particularly in the summer when the the<br>lizard team arrived and this is where I<br>learned Natural History so there were<br>Dave Houston's and you're in Sally's and<br>your grandma's that was super generous<br>with their knowledge and the late Tony<br>Whitaker who you know taught me about<br>being a scientist<br>so these guys were just enthusiasts<br>about natural history<br>I didn't know anything and I just jumped<br>on every opportunity yeah let's go see<br>the bulk Pine I don't know what the bulk<br>point is but it sounds real special for<br>this landscape and it was<br>um so seating Predator traps whatever<br>was happening including dagging the<br>farmer's sheep to keep him on side as<br>well this is always a bit of politics at<br>Play<br>and there's so much leveling at places<br>like this you know it doesn't matter<br>whether you're the senior scientist on a<br>student the dog manager everyone does<br>the dishes and everybody digs a hole for<br>the toilet bucket<br>so great experiences but really it was<br>uh Doug and Maria on the left here that<br>really were formative to me as a<br>scientist they were post-docs from the<br>University of Kansas that were working<br>here Doug worked on reptiles and Maria<br>worked on small mammals<br>but you'll notice they have two small<br>children there so that was a real light<br>bulb moment for me here's Maria a<br>scientist with a one-year-old and a<br>four-year-old I'd never met a woman<br>scientist with children before and they<br>were in the field with the toilet back<br>in<br>um so okay mum sent lots of toys and<br>books up but they were really formative<br>to spending lots of time with me and<br>very generous with their advice<br>and you know it's things like our memba<br>coming across Doug<br>um when I was walking to my site across<br>the ridge from his and he was just<br>sitting in the tussock just staring into<br>space so it went over and sat by him and<br>said what's going on Doug he's like it's<br>not working my experiment's not working<br>I hadn't counted on the ferrets of<br>course you wouldn't when you were<br>designing this in the states<br>um<br>and that whole deer that he would that<br>science is hard sometimes it doesn't<br>work and it's okay to say so<br>um and that he involved me as a very<br>young honors student in solving that<br>problem so I'm really grateful for<br>experiences like that and it's those<br>small moments that people spend with you<br>that are really influential<br>so when it was a bad lizard day so<br>um and a bad Liz a day as it's pouring<br>with rain Doug got to stay home with the<br>kids and the Hut probably making scones<br>and Maria and I went out in the rain<br>climbed over the Rocks you know health<br>and safety and we id'd all of the plants<br>that were on the rocks and the amount of<br>fruit they were providing for the<br>lizards there<br>um and that getting stuck in and helping<br>but I think Crystal Cohn said the other<br>day was a reciprocal altruism it was<br>just Karma this came back to be a huge<br>opportunity uh for me in the end<br>so after writing my thesis by hand then<br>typing on the Mac classic no one had<br>their own computers back then really<br>excited when zip drives came along<br>um I made some decisions about a PhD<br>I decided that I wanted to do a<br>theoretical PhD I did not want to go<br>through an endangered species politics<br>restrictions again I wanted to learn<br>some skills first before I got back into<br>the applied stuff<br>and not to worry about sample sizes<br>so on my 21st birthday I left New<br>Zealand for the first time with Darren<br>it was our first plane ride to start my<br>PhD<br>and the days before Zoom my choice of<br>supervisor Alan was made entirely on the<br>basis of a dad joke about a fruitful<br>relationship<br>um and I thought you know what I can<br>work with this guy and he's not so scary<br>um so and that supervisor relationship<br>is so critical and I'm so grateful that<br>I made the right decision<br>um there I learned a lot about doing<br>science from Alan and also learned a lot<br>about supervising students from him and<br>I certainly can feel him beside me when<br>I'm supervising my students<br>although I'm not sure I've bought them<br>as many coffees as uh he did for me so<br>so<br>one thing I've only realized now was how<br>much Alan trusted me and supported me<br>because during my PhD during the<br>Australian winter for two Winters he<br>allowed me to go over to the US for um<br>two months and work on an earthwatch<br>project with Doug Moran which is a<br>pretty big level of trust so Doug and<br>Maria<br>obviously were pleased that I got out in<br>the rain and helped with the plants and<br>they wrote me and Darren into a funding<br>bid for earthwatch to teach 16 year olds<br>from all around the states about science<br>and get them excited about science so it<br>really paid off we were flown to Arizona<br>for those two American Summers 30k from<br>the Mexican border you're introduced to<br>small town America<br>road runners Bobcats and the Delights of<br>research station tuna salad which is not<br>good<br>um<br>I'm not sure that South Islanders are<br>really suited to field work and 50<br>degrees in the desert<br>and probably also not very safe when it<br>comes to rattlesnakes and avoiding armed<br>border patrol guards but we survived in<br>the end the study species was this<br>whip-tailed lizard here fully<br>parthenogenic only females no males some<br>of the action there was a bit<br>eye-opening from some of the kids from<br>Alabama and Tennessee<br>um but it was we set up some really neat<br>experiments we had to first again this<br>is pretty hard rock you know I'm going<br>to dig some purple traps in here so we<br>had to work out how to get these lizards<br>that were going straight under these<br>very prickly Mesquite bushes and we<br>constructed these corels with heavy<br>chains at the bottom to drive them in so<br>pretty amazing experiencing to top it<br>off on the last day of field work Darren<br>and I got married much to the confusion<br>of the high school students there as<br>well it was not in the radar at all<br>the research has given me the record for<br>the longest research to be published so<br>this year we have just submitted a paper<br>from this research<br>so I have so much hope now for the rest<br>of my projects that are in filing<br>cabinets<br>so again uh trained as a scientist and<br>then back in 2003 I'd only been at<br>landcare for a year or so on akifenoir<br>is a postdoc and got contacted by Judy<br>O'Brien saying we need to run an ecology<br>course we've had an external review and<br>SPS is not looking so great in ecology<br>can we subcontract monarchy fenua so I<br>got Bruce and Bruce Boons and Robin<br>simcock on board and was in this was<br>deepened stuff for me this was I've done<br>today I don't know anything about<br>learning design turns out all you need<br>when your clueless is Studio Brian so<br>thanks Judy<br>um but this is the first slide from my<br>first lecture ever back when that blue<br>gradient was just wow that was the thing<br>you know<br>so I'm really hoping that I've got<br>better than that now<br>but field trips are the highlight of any<br>uh course for us it's where we get to to<br>know the students teach them some<br>practical skills and get them connected<br>to nature which for a university in the<br>middle of a giant city is absolutely<br>critical that we we get them out there<br>even at first year where they struggle<br>to climb over the log and we've had some<br>amazing trips with some amazing and<br>famous ta faces in there<br>most of these teaching trips were<br>co-designed by Bruce Burns and we've had<br>lots of fun over the years designing<br>awesome field trips so thanks to to<br>Bruce we've had to do a lot of learning<br>over the years<br>budgets islands are expensive and more<br>recently learning how to make our field<br>trips more inclusive for all students<br>we've also I think you can see Kelly<br>Booth sitting here we're being supported<br>by some amazing ticks over the years and<br>Joe's in the audience site which is<br>great<br>um who else oh yeah<br>that's the one thing I had to do<br>um so Sandra amazing ecological<br>knowledge and we're so grateful to have<br>her for her wealth of knowledge she also<br>keeps Bruce and iron check all the time<br>and she makes sure that those students<br>um in my early career at monarchy<br>funeral I didn't have I had a distinct<br>lack of woman scientists who were models<br>or mentors in my early career years I<br>did have some blokes who weren't<br>involved in my postdoc in any way but<br>Phil Cowan Peter Williams in the late<br>Ross Beaver who are utterly generous<br>with their time and encouragement and<br>just their interest in me as a young<br>scientist and so it's been those key<br>moments of kindness the way they talked<br>to me that make a huge difference to<br>people<br>um and I also want to acknowledge here<br>it was a fantastic colleague while we<br>were at the weed buyer control team<br>together at monarchy funeral but also<br>for his patience with my Dunedin toddler<br>first steps and missteps in my journey<br>on tell Maori so he's been very patient<br>with that thank you<br>and then<br>um lucky for me Mick applied for some<br>funding for math biosecurity to start a<br>postgrad masters in biosecurity and so<br>funding came with it so they put out an<br>advert for a lecturer<br>um so thank Mick for getting the funding<br>and I got that job<br>so big thank you to Margaret Golson from<br>faculty of science here in Judy as well<br>who really helped me sort of I've done a<br>course but a program at something really<br>really different<br>and I didn't understand any of it so<br>um thank you for that and for some good<br>teaching design<br>but also to end boothroid from school of<br>environment at the time<br>he had been running block courses block<br>courses were new and esps and he was<br>really generous with his uh time so<br>and some of you are in the audience<br>tonight thank you for the practitioners<br>who have come into these classes I think<br>we've got some really good work<br>integrated learning out of our postgres<br>students produce some amazing reports I<br>think the Myrtle rust one was used<br>during the incursion<br>um and I think we've produced some<br>pretty amazing graduates over the years<br>for them<br>so also uh thanks to my teaching teams<br>we've actually got some really amazing<br>teachers in SBS who prioritize the<br>teaching when researchers calling us<br>um so thank you to those teaching teams<br>and the professional teaching fellows<br>which I didn't discover until I started<br>doing first year lectures in<br>particularly Caroline who's been so<br>helpful to me with um<br>particularly assessment design which is<br>pretty hard tricky<br>and although it was<br>quite a commitment to be on our school<br>board for six years I picked the right<br>School in stonefields was really ahead<br>of the curve in terms of their learning<br>design so I thank them for leading me in<br>on these secrets and for the maniah<br>Kalani trust learning about how to take<br>all our Learners with us as well<br>but I really found my work home when I<br>moved to Tamaki campus<br>um and uh so I think my academic<br>colleagues particularly Mac and Jack one<br>of those early days but later on all the<br>rest there<br>um for creating an awesome family<br>culture at Tamaki uh but particularly at<br>admin staff Kerala and Bessie who really<br>cared about each and every student and<br>uh always pulled us out of our offices<br>and into the tea room to talk to each<br>other amazing stuff<br>um<br>and the lack of women mentors<br>particularly with babies really kind of<br>showed early in my career so when I was<br>on maternity leave and Lucy was just six<br>weeks old my back fell for my block<br>course I had a family emergency I didn't<br>think I could say no so I took six week<br>old Lucy in to do a block course today<br>14 years later I hope we'd just cancel<br>the course but BC and caroler were just<br>amazing and helping me juggle feeding<br>sleeping in teaching in the summary<br>during those eight hours days so thank<br>you to them but we did revolve around<br>food and drink my favorite of course a<br>single malt and cheese rolls can't go<br>astray<br>and you know<br>parties are really good for creativity<br>I've said how artistic our students are<br>but then the creative side kind of<br>disappeared when we moved into the<br>campus Because we moved in just before<br>uh covert to the city so covert has hit<br>us and more recently floods have hit us<br>so I just to call out a shout out to my<br>awesome Corridor colleagues in the<br>basement<br>we get we'll get there we'll get there<br>with that culture going again we just<br>need to keep the disasters at Bay<br>but I do really want to emphasize the<br>importance of social interactions and<br>coffee breaks as actually being really<br>critical to being productive sometimes<br>we talk nonsense<br>often we just checked in with each other<br>but sometimes we ranted and those rant<br>sometimes turned into something<br>important and Jacqueline Bruce and I<br>ranted about that removal of Urban Tree<br>protection and add that morning tea we<br>come up with a plan for scrambling some<br>money together and hiring Sarah who just<br>finished her PhD to to analyze some data<br>and write this paper which is paper I'm<br>really proud of because of the way it<br>came about but also it's been one that's<br>been used by barristers and the unitary<br>plan and by MPS and the rme process just<br>hopefully one day we might get there<br>with some true protection bad<br>so back to research I have switched<br>topics and taxa fairly often usually<br>because I haven't had a job and was<br>trying to get funding so those early<br>years of continuous fixed term positions<br>are really tricky I also have intense<br>fomo which probably explains the variety<br>of projects I've been involved in so<br>everybody tries to figure out what my<br>research area is I recently had someone<br>introduce me as a botanist then at the<br>conference in November someone<br>introduced me as a social scientist and<br>all of this I could hear my colleagues<br>and students sniggering around me so I<br>do tend to confuse people with what my<br>research is so I'm just going to let the<br>word cloud speak for itself the larger<br>the word the more research I've done in<br>the area just to say no marine or fresh<br>water already got too many fingers in<br>pies<br>so<br>I think it's sometimes a little bit odd<br>danger of knowing a little bit about<br>lots of things but I'm less defensive<br>about that now instead of saying oh Bill<br>Lee or Kevin Gaston do it I actually<br>enjoy being able to apply knowledge and<br>techniques from different taxa and I<br>think that it actually adds a bit so try<br>not to be defensive about that now<br>but often my research drivers and<br>supporters have actually come from the<br>community or Council or practitioners<br>and I've responded to what they're<br>interested in so I have learned from so<br>and I'm here I'm in trouble because I've<br>missed someone's logo out but thanks to<br>everyone<br>so I've learned so much from Community<br>groups from these practitioners<br>and I'm still learning the one thing I<br>know is that we can't do our science and<br>isolation of society you know our<br>salaries are paid by new zealanders and<br>we've also got an obligation to help if<br>we if we can<br>so<br>um thanks to the aucklanders who let all<br>my<br>postgrades come onto their properties at<br>ungodly hours of the morning to do bird<br>counts and whatever else<br>and also thanks to people like Shah who<br>has opened my eyes to looking at the<br>nahre in a different way<br>and if you ever get the chance go on a<br>heck or it was sha it'll blow you away<br>so always learning and I particularly<br>want to thank<br>all the council staff I've worked with<br>there's a heap of Auckland Council<br>people here today so thank you but also<br>some of these other councils I have<br>learned so much from Council staff<br>I am an ore of their knowledge and their<br>technical skills but also their service<br>to their respective communities and I do<br>get very distressed about the disdain<br>that some community members have towards<br>our Council staff when they're fronting<br>difficult conversations so I just want<br>to have a shout out to council stuff we<br>appreciate you and um yeah I hope things<br>improve<br>I don't know how you do it<br>um<br>and although most of my research is<br>applied I have had the privilege of<br>working with may bierenbaum only because<br>the study species the parsonant web worm<br>that she has been working on for decades<br>arrived in my hometown about a k or two<br>from my parents house and I jumped on<br>the opportunity to work with her she is<br>an awesome woman and science role model<br>and a science communication role model<br>she does outreach in so many different<br>ways is um<br>for the old people among us she had a<br>character named after her in The X-Files<br>the forensic entomologist<br>and more importantly she was awarded the<br>national medal of science from Barack<br>Obama for her research and science<br>communication<br>I sometimes like to feel a little bit<br>confident that she looks like she has an<br>imposter syndrome there it's someone so<br>great can sometimes feel but then I<br>actually loved this picture better where<br>Barack is looking at her in awe so I<br>think May for all her generous advice<br>over the years<br>and I believe a scientists were<br>obligated to communicate our science he<br>haven't completed your science until<br>you've communicated it so shout out to<br>Anne beston who everyone seems to be<br>retiring it's terrible who was our media<br>advisor and particularly because she<br>took the time with my post-grade<br>students when it was their first radio<br>or TV interview to really calm them down<br>and talk them through it and that was<br>really thoughtful of her and and not<br>many people would do that<br>and I'm going to shout out to more<br>blokes sign of the times in my field<br>um and the reason uh these blokes are<br>particularly thanking them because they<br>have really taught me how to act on a<br>technical Advisory Group and they've<br>been instrumental to learn how to be a<br>scientist giving technical advice it's a<br>really incent The Imposter syndrome<br>kicks in when you're in early career<br>researcher where you can't put caveats<br>on things we just need a decision<br>and I think coming from a a family of<br>nine yelling over top of each other I<br>have to tell myself to stop talking in<br>meetings and I use weight why am I<br>talking sometimes it works most of the<br>time it doesn't but it's a good strategy<br>and these three are really good at<br>cutting through the waffle and getting<br>that really good advice out more<br>importantly they never dismissed me as<br>an a female early career scientist they<br>encouraged me they took my suggestions<br>seriously and I never dismissed them so<br>I thank them and New Zealand's going to<br>be a lot worse with these guys retired<br>and I'm still learning about science<br>communication especially tricky<br>intergenerational stuff it's really hard<br>to communicate it's been great learning<br>with pepper raccoon through the drawing<br>science about how to collaborate<br>collaborations hard<br>um and I feel really bad for her having<br>to collaborate with me I had the<br>audacity to draw her a picture trying to<br>explain<br>my my thoughts so I thank her for not<br>laughing too much and look what a<br>collaboration you do<br>important points are that we all have<br>strengths and we all have weaknesses so<br>collaboration is key<br>again this is dangerous I hope to God I<br>haven't left someone off<br>but I think in a research environment<br>where reviews and models are taking over<br>uh these are the people who do that<br>basic biological data collection that we<br>desperately need for our fauna and Flora<br>so this is where the best data is<br>produced they've got the time and the<br>energy to click day in and day out while<br>we're using wahapoo and timetabling and<br>Concur<br>and they collect data literally Through<br>Blood Sweat and Tears<br>so being a supervisor is definitely the<br>most rewarding part of my job we have<br>these long-term relationships with these<br>wonderful early career researchers I<br>love seeing them grow in confidence it's<br>also the most difficult part of my job<br>life throws science but mainly life<br>throws curveballs at young people and<br>I'm an aura of the strength and<br>resilience that all of them have shown<br>so<br>on behalf of my postgrades I also want<br>to thank friends and particularly family<br>that have supported them families are a<br>really important part of ecological<br>research for some reason we always have<br>to make new things we have to build new<br>things that haven't been built before<br>and we have long hours in the field<br>and Sonia provides us with baking thank<br>you Sonia so baked goods are always<br>welcome<br>so thanks families<br>but I can't go through all of my<br>students haven't got enough time but I<br>am going to mention Cheryl because she<br>seriously was the guinea pig so<br>uh I had very little training on how to<br>be a supervisor and lent heavily on the<br>things Alan had taught me<br>um so boy I was learning fast uh how to<br>be a supervisor there was real ups and<br>downs here we had fear of pigs we had<br>Hunters we had rugby players<br>we had Cody dieback we had Cheryl's mum<br>needing double knee surgery after field<br>work<br>and we had Cheryl being caught up in the<br>Christchurch earthquake but we learned<br>together how to navigate that first<br>student supervisor relationship create a<br>lab group together and gained a friend<br>for life<br>and with Bruce and Nick who here and<br>Dave and support we also made some<br>really awesome contributions to how<br>feral pigs are managed in New Zealand so<br>thank you also to all of the<br>co-supervisors who have supported my um<br>my students and I there's nothing better<br>than a supervisory team that hums it's<br>nothing better than sitting down with<br>that piece of paper and drawing really<br>stupid science diagrams so thank you for<br>that support<br>and I'm gonna mention Josie because when<br>I was reflecting on this I realized that<br>my career was a game of two halves<br>so there's before Josie after Josie and<br>Josie turned up my office and said<br>I wanted to approve it on Urban Ecology<br>on bird feeding I was like wow what are<br>you talking about and I was utterly<br>confused and a bit bemused because all<br>of my research had been in protected<br>areas or in uh on invasive species to<br>protect areas so this is really new for<br>me um you can see what a difference it<br>made so I thank Josie for<br>bringing this field uh to my attention<br>and showing me the opportunities that<br>can be had and the really awesome<br>science<br>um and of course Josie lead the way with<br>some pretty high impact<br>papers on her project and some also<br>really awesome science communication<br>that set the the lab group up in a<br>really good way<br>and we learned a lot of stuff we learned<br>that Urban Ecology is horrific because<br>of the heterogeneity the multiple<br>drivers and people<br>but we also learned it has its upsides<br>when you're cold and miserable<br>so even if the delivery drivers are<br>looking highly bemused about why there's<br>a bunch of people hanging out in<br>carports in the middle of the week<br>so I have promised some challenges I<br>think I put challenges but anybody who<br>knows me will know their rants John said<br>they were a informed opinion so I'll<br>take that as a compliment<br>it's been hard narrowing down uh just a<br>couple of rounds but just a brief<br>comment on climate change as I was<br>reflecting on my life I was in sixth<br>form which is year 12 when I wrote my<br>first essay on climate change my son is<br>now in year 12. and it feels like we<br>have done nothing in 30 years<br>so I don't think this is a science issue<br>anymore this is a people issue I wonder<br>if instead of biology class we're also<br>teaching climate change and economics<br>and in social studies and in English<br>because we ain't making much progress<br>otherwise<br>recent extreme events have hopefully<br>given another boost to the need for<br>urban green cities to protect lives at<br>the very least if nothing else in terms<br>of all the other benefits that<br>vegetation and city gives us a shout out<br>to Robinson and Bruce Burns for all<br>the many conversations we've had on how<br>to implement Urban Greening how to<br>improve outcomes and it can be done on<br>an extreme way in South Korea here I<br>mean it does look like Spaghetti<br>Junction in Auckland<br>we just need good leadership in place<br>and the focus has to be on integrating<br>nature-based Solutions with our hard<br>infrastructure<br>and a side rant we have to stop taking<br>things from Europe and the UK and the US<br>and just plonking them on our indigenous<br>ecosystems and our indigenous people so<br>we have to think carefully before we're<br>putting some of those Solutions in place<br>but we are getting there<br>as I walk to football games I take<br>photos of hideous Urban stuff but we are<br>replacing it with green infrastructure<br>but we've actually got a long way<br>to go and supporting and funding this<br>and in leading it<br>so you have five days to go<br>five days<br>this is having huge ramifications for<br>our city and our people and as of<br>yesterday people like me have submitted<br>to everybody here who's under 40. do it<br>because this is huge so just go do it<br>I think the biggest challenges for<br>biologists this is a million and one<br>different Frameworks on<br>transdisciplinary research and I still<br>don't think we know how to do it<br>we but as biologists we have to be a<br>tiny part of the puzzle and not dominate<br>the system with other disciplines and<br>communities as add-ons so truly trying<br>to work with different people and<br>different disciplines from engineering<br>to governance to social science we've<br>got a lot to learn thank you for Maureen<br>mcentee and Nicki harde and Joe Ali and<br>Julie Kidd from Doc for letting me dip<br>my toes in the water of people aspects<br>of nature but fundamentally we're going<br>to go past other disciplines to truly<br>partner with communities and planners<br>and practitioners in Maori communities<br>and entities<br>in a much better way than we're doing<br>now and I certainly I think that's a<br>challenge because we all work on<br>different time scales and priorities<br>I didn't say I had any answers to any of<br>this<br>and teaching challenges I've whipped<br>this off Kate's uh Twitter feed last<br>year and I think universities the world<br>over are struggling to get students back<br>into classes yes there's horrific<br>timetabling but the online learning<br>during covert has made it very difficult<br>to get them back not to mention the<br>family and work pressures that our<br>students have but ecologists we've got<br>to get them back into the field we've<br>got to get them learning those practical<br>skills<br>I really wouldn't be confident of my son<br>learning to drive from a video I don't<br>think we want to give Council those<br>people and so how do we get them to<br>continue those nature connections<br>continue those practical skills but<br>still dealing with these issues around<br>Equity around family and work<br>and I think the other thing that we do<br>or don't do is around science being a<br>team sport I've been assessed on my<br>promotion individually our students are<br>being assessed individually our<br>employers want people who can<br>collaborate and work in a team and do we<br>have those conversations<br>about what collaboration is and how to<br>have difficult conversations<br>um and uh Crystal would say new<br>zealanders are not good at difficult<br>conversations anyway<br>um so maybe we need to teach ourselves<br>um before we teach our students<br>so since I've made it too old and<br>supposedly wise Professor stage I'm<br>going to share a few take homes for you<br>I really don't want you to underestimate<br>your role in being a teacher even while<br>you're still learning because every<br>small connection that you have with<br>people can make a huge influence on<br>their lives as it has done with me<br>we need diversity of nature connections<br>for people and we need a diversity of<br>people connections we need everybody on<br>board from volunteers to practitioners<br>to planners and researchers<br>we need to ensure that everyone no<br>matter what the socio-economic status is<br>has access to Nature and the benefits of<br>that nature connection<br>and we need to make multi-functional<br>spaces and this comes back to Abby's<br>research on schools that we can have<br>learning environments but with heaps of<br>biodiversity on them so we can get the<br>the both things in one space we can have<br>our cake<br>ugly cake and eat it too<br>but one of the most important take homes<br>is that you need to make sure you take<br>and Darren supported my career from the<br>very first time our discs were together<br>during our honors year while growing his<br>own career trying to look after a<br>million arthropods he's still got a<br>couple of thousand native hymenopteran<br>to describe before he retires<br>he's been a great collaborator but also<br>taken a load of the family<br>duties more than his first year<br>especially at the football admin thank<br>you<br>but despite everything I've done my two<br>kids<br>Jamie and Lucy are my best outputs they<br>they've put up with mum being away or<br>late a lot that bothered them when they<br>were little now not so much they're<br>quite happy when I'm away but it<br>definitely keeps me grounded and the<br>only thing they want is for mum not to<br>embarrass them<br>biologist kids full of nature<br>connections they've been to amazing<br>places<br>there have been on many many field<br>collections<br>and have been brimming with curiosity<br>until they turn into teenagers<br>but the good news is that that's okay<br>because according to some of the<br>research coming out of the University of<br>Derby they are completely normal<br>teenagers<br>teenagers become far less connected to<br>Nature as they grow and unfortunately<br>for everyone it's going to take another<br>20 years to get their back based on<br>current research<br>so like everything with teenagers I just<br>need to wait them out and they'll<br>eventually get their nature connection<br>again<br>thank you all</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
