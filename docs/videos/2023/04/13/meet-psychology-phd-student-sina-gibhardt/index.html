https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-psychology/should-i-do-a-phd-.html?cq_ck=1680664917639</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>children<br>what are they<br>how do they think and importantly how<br>they made all pressing questions to<br>which I don't have any answers but Cena<br>who works at the Early Learning lab may<br>be able to provide us some insights into<br>these pressing questions<br>so Xena I've been walking around today<br>checking out the faces places and spaces<br>within postgrad psychology and I'm<br>wondering where are we well we are in<br>the waiting room of our lab and we have<br>families come in to study children's<br>development and so in this wedding room<br>we bring the families in to warm up and<br>play with the kids and so we have lots<br>of really cool toys cool cool I'm very<br>distracted indeed what do you do in the<br>Ella lab<br>um I'm a PhD student and in my final<br>year and I was part of a big<br>longitudinal study where we look at how<br>children kind of learn to cooperate with<br>each other help and share take other<br>people's perspectives and so I came in<br>for this big project and ran one of the<br>data collection waves and used the data<br>for my PhD awesome yeah I specifically<br>am really interested in actually whether<br>helping makes kids happy so I look at<br>the positive emotions that might be<br>elicited which might motivate them in<br>the future to do that again because<br>we're quite a social species so why do<br>we do that and one factor might be<br>because it makes us feel really good we<br>design experiments so we have tasks so<br>for example I look at a helping tasks<br>where we have you know the experiment in<br>needing help and then they give the kids<br>cues of what kind of help they need and<br>they get a score for it for example if<br>they don't help they would get a zero<br>and if they have really quickly they get<br>a three and we can see what kind of<br>factors influence how children how<br>quickly they help so so whether for<br>example parenting factors influence<br>whether they get a three or zero if that<br>makes sense yeah yeah for you what is<br>the most rewarding thing kind of as a<br>PhD student I really love teaching<br>tutoring really gave me the opportunity<br>to interact with with other students and<br>um to teach them and to actually feel<br>like conveying my knowledge in a way and<br>you would get feedback from the students<br>interact with them another Point really<br>is that I really love interacting with<br>the kids and really see how they react<br>to the tasks that we design and how much<br>fun they have and then I hope that the<br>results that we kind of gain from it can<br>really help policies of parents I<br>imagine you've found some really<br>interesting things can you share<br>spoilers of what you've found when it<br>comes to children and helping we<br>generally find that over time kids help<br>more quickly so they become a competent<br>and in terms of positive emotions we see<br>that those kids who are spontaneous<br>helpers that really want to help show<br>the highest happiness but it doesn't<br>seem to be intuitive it's kind of like<br>an unconscious process<br>yeah what's it like being part of an<br>active research team<br>it's really great because it gives me<br>the opportunity<br>um<br>doing in<br>their masters PhD honors students what<br>they're doing and so we would be working<br>on projects together we can give each<br>other feedback and so it just gives you<br>the feeling that you're part of a of a<br>bigger team like Cena I imagine that a<br>lot of students are watching this<br>wanting to the PHD thinking about it<br>what do you think they should expect and<br>what is your advice for those who are<br>thinking about pursuing them my advice<br>more then a PhD is great to explore this<br>because you have the freedom to do so<br>think about what you're passionate about<br>whether there is someone out there who<br>can facilitate that and then go for it<br>Cena congratulations on making this far<br>it's your PhD<br>um best of luck for the rest of it<br>thanks for letting us in your colorful<br>crib and see you later thanks for coming<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
