chair<br>please join me in welcoming Professor<br>Bremer to deliver the graduation address<br>Chancellor<br>acting Vice chancellor who worship the<br>mayor<br>members of the University Council<br>colleagues<br>graduates<br>family and friends I warmly greet you<br>Chancellor<br>thank you for your very kind words<br>introduction<br>graduates I offer you my sincere<br>congratulations on this very special<br>occasion<br>I'd also like to acknowledge the support<br>that you have received from your family<br>and friends and to thank them for being<br>there for you<br>as the chancellor mentioned I am a proud<br>anomalous of the University of otago<br>as a student I had the privilege of<br>crossing the stage to graduate three<br>times<br>on none of those occasions did it into<br>my mind that one day I would have the<br>honor of giving a graduation address<br>I sincerely thanked the university for<br>the first time I graduated was in May<br>1983.<br>weirdly enough almost 40 years ago to<br>the day<br>I had arrived in Dunedin in 1980 as a<br>very fresh-faced kid from invercargill<br>who enjoyed spearfishing and snorkeling<br>for power around the southern coast but<br>also growing up watching Jacques<br>Cousteau on TV and I thought a career in<br>Marine Science seemed interesting<br>once I started study I found that I was<br>interested in a wide range of topics and<br>I ended up with a Bachelor of Science<br>after completing the BSC I started a<br>master's in Marine Science investigating<br>how bacteria and Marine sediments bind<br>chromium which at that time was being<br>discharged into the Harbor from a local<br>Tannery<br>on the completion of the EMC I was<br>really not that Keen to graduate in<br>person<br>but I did mainly to please my mother<br>mum loved the Pomp and ceremonial<br>graduation as well as the opportunity to<br>I think started a PhD looking at what<br>happened to see urgent larvae if they<br>ate the bacteria or algae containing<br>chromium<br>on the completion of my PhD I was this<br>time very happy to graduate in person<br>both in my family and for myself<br>I thought I had really earned the right<br>to celebrate as have all of you who have<br>graduates some of you here today will<br>have sailed through your degree and you<br>only have fond memories of your time at<br>University<br>others of you would have found your time<br>at University to be a little more<br>challenging<br>perhaps owing to academic social<br>economic or maybe pandemic reasons your<br>degree took longer to complete than<br>originally planned<br>maybe you your family or your friends<br>for those of you who went through tough<br>times completing your degree I offer you<br>my heartfelt congratulations well done<br>you made it<br>the experiences you have gained in<br>overcoming your challenges will be<br>invaluable to you as you proceed through<br>life<br>a number of years ago I supervised a PhD<br>student who for a variety of reasons<br>took around six years to complete what<br>is ideally a three-year degree<br>some of these reasons were of their own<br>making and others were due to just sheer<br>bad luck<br>nevertheless they persevered they owned<br>their mistakes and coped well with<br>misfortune<br>when I eventually received a copy of<br>their PHD thesis they had included on<br>its first page in African proverb which<br>I thought was very appropriate and very<br>insightful<br>it read<br>I encourage you all to consider how the<br>challenges you have faced have made you<br>I would like to take this opportunity to<br>pass on to the graduates some<br>Reflections from my career which I hope<br>may serve as a guide for you and your<br>the first reflection is the importance<br>of having the confidence in your<br>abilities<br>and in the quality of the education you<br>have been privileged to have received<br>to back yourself<br>do not be afraid to seize the<br>opportunities that come your way<br>and to strive for excellence in all you<br>do<br>I urge you to volunteer to give that<br>presentation we'll lead that project<br>even if you hate being sent a stage<br>to bite off more than you can chew and<br>into true like hell<br>to not be afraid to push the boundaries<br>of what you believe you can achieve<br>if you dare to take chances you may be<br>surprised what opportunities can take<br>you<br>looking back I can now clearly see how<br>seizing such opportunities have made a<br>during my PhD the lab I was working in<br>hosting an American Professor on a six<br>month sabbatical<br>I was studying how bacteria and<br>sediments bindmetals and he was studying<br>how bacteria attached to metal pipes and<br>based on this tenuous Link in the fact<br>that whenever he was around I worked as<br>hard as I possibly could<br>he offered me a postdoctoral position in<br>his laboratory first in Long Beach<br>Walden Bozeman I was rung up one day by<br>the CEO of plant and food research here<br>in New Zealand<br>this was in 1990 a New Zealand Public<br>had just been shocked by the tragic<br>deaths of twin neonates from a woman who<br>during pregnancy had eaten the stereo<br>contaminated Hot Smoke muscles<br>plant and food research had a unit based<br>in Nelson and they were looking for a<br>microbiologist with Marine background to<br>over the phone the CEO outlined The<br>Challenge and asked me if if I thought I<br>could help<br>I mumbled something like hmm the stereo<br>can be challenging to control but yes I<br>think I can help<br>I then hung up the phone<br>ran across the library and searched for<br>anything I could find on listeria<br>I went on to have an enjoyable 10 years<br>working at the seafood research units in<br>Nelson and did develop some expertise in<br>over that time I realized it was one<br>thing to make safe food<br>it was another thing to make safe food<br>that tasted great<br>so I got more and more interested in how<br>food was produced and its flavor and<br>quality<br>while attending a food science<br>conference in Napier I mentioned these<br>evolving interests to a fellow attendee<br>who was a professor at the University of<br>otago<br>over a beer or two he realized that my<br>background could be useful to the<br>Department of Food Science and he<br>offered in the election job<br>now despite having never lectured before<br>I said yes on the spot<br>20 years on from that decision I've not<br>regretted a minute of my time as an<br>when the chancellor kindly introduced me<br>you heard that I hold leadership<br>positions on a number of national bodies<br>and that I provide advice to a number of<br>food companies<br>I stress that is not solely my academic<br>ability or my knowledge of the food<br>industry that led me to being offered<br>these positions<br>rather it was because I was fortunate to<br>have earlier my career strong mentors<br>who by their actions demonstrated the<br>value of treating everyone as an equal<br>and the importance of building strong<br>networks and corporations based on trust<br>and speak<br>it was the networks and trusts I<br>developed within Academia<br>government and the food industry that<br>led to my appointments<br>respect and Trust<br>is crucial to any relationship<br>hence I stress the importance of<br>upholding High professional and academic<br>my next Emperor's most important<br>reflection is to note how easy it can be<br>in the rush and pressure of a career to<br>lose track of what really matters<br>I cannot overstate the importance of<br>looking after what is most dear to you<br>your loved ones your family and your<br>friends<br>despite<br>the many competing pressures you may be<br>under I urge you to give to them the<br>you will have noted that I've encouraged<br>you to seize opportunities and to do<br>more<br>I've also stated the importance of<br>making time for your family friends and<br>colleagues<br>disapparent contradiction leads me to my<br>final reflection<br>which is the challenge in the importance<br>of using your time wisely<br>as you proceed through your career you<br>will need to determine for yourself the<br>relative importance of time spent<br>striving for recognition promotion power<br>wealth or fame<br>versus time speaking for family or<br>friends well being a good partner<br>supporting those you love taking time to<br>stop and smell the roses or in my case<br>is someone much closer to the end of a<br>career than the start of it it is clear<br>to me that the love and support of my<br>family and friends and the respect of my<br>colleagues is what brings me the most<br>graduates I appreciate that Phil as you<br>are with optimism for the exciting<br>opportunities ahead my words may not<br>seem that relevant today<br>however it is my hope that in the<br>fullness of time they may resonate and<br>provide some guidance<br>in the meantime I encourage you to<br>embrace with Open Hearts and Minds all<br>of the great experiences that the<br>somewhat troubled world still offers<br>live the otago motto in all you do<br>separate alday<br>dare to be wise<br>thank you very much Professor Bremer<br>Phil for speaking to us today we're<br>privileged to have a dedicated Professor<br>like you here at the University of otago<br>and I
