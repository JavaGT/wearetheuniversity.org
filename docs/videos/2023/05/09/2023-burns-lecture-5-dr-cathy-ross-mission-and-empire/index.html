thoroughly<br>enjoying the series so far and look<br>forward to tonight's lecture on Mission<br>and Empire thank you<br>thank you Murray<br>good evening everyone<br>so I've entitled tonight's lecture<br>another world is here Mission and Empire<br>Octavius Hadfield pioneering profit or<br>complicit colonialist<br>so um this paper actually was co-written<br>by myself and my colleague James Butler<br>as a result of a conversation that we<br>had Around Mission and Empire<br>so we decided to work it up into a paper<br>and I've always been and we've used<br>Octavius Hadfield as a kind of case<br>study I hasten to add I am not an expert<br>on Octavius Hadfield I actually know<br>more about his wife Kate because she was<br>one of the women I looked at for my PhD<br>but that piqued my interest in Octavius<br>because obviously when you read about<br>the wives you also read something of<br>their husbands and I was always<br>interested in Octavius he struck me as a<br>very interesting character in his<br>advocacy for Maori<br>so we've used Hadfield as a kind of case<br>study<br>or more precisely one particular event<br>that Hadfield was involved in during his<br>time his life in aotearo New Zealand<br>so I'd like to begin this paper by<br>acknowledging where James and I write<br>from<br>we do write from within Empire<br>as scholar Dorothy zerla has said we are<br>doing our theology while still living in<br>Egypt<br>well we may not not like this labor we<br>have to acknowledge that we are white my<br>colleague James and I he's English we<br>live in a prosperous Nation whether<br>that's the UK or aotearoa and continue<br>to benefit from Empire<br>and as we tend to discuss Octavius<br>Hadfield we acknowledge that we have a<br>lot more in common with Hadfield than<br>with Maori<br>as much as they want to critique and<br>learn there is something in us which<br>wants to name Hadfield as the goodie if<br>you like the pioneering Prophet as the<br>one who was compromised by Empire but<br>tried to do his best to be faithful to<br>God and to be a good friend to Maori<br>we too have experienced this tension and<br>cross-cultural Mission I've worked in<br>Rwanda Congo in Uganda James has worked<br>in Uruguay and other Latin American<br>countries and we know we have not done<br>everything right we've struggled with<br>our privilege and our position we have<br>felt the pressure to evangelize to show<br>ourselves worthy of the support we<br>received<br>we have also thought to be good friends<br>and allies to those with whom we have<br>worked<br>we have wanted to be known as the<br>goodies<br>but can we step back enough to ask<br>deeper questions<br>perhaps in Reading Hadfield we can get<br>Beyond us we can get Beyond asking this<br>binary question<br>whether he was a pioneering Prophet or<br>complicit colonialist<br>and instead ask deeper questions<br>that can disclose our own complicity<br>with the empires of our time<br>our tendency to relate more easily to<br>Hadfield than the Maori clearly shapes<br>this paper and it would undoubtedly look<br>very different from the perspective of<br>the colonized those not living in Egypt<br>so Octavius Hadfield was initially a CMS<br>missionary in aotearo New Zealand from<br>1839 until he became Bishop of<br>Wellington in 1870 and later primate<br>he died in 1904 at the age of 91. he was<br>born on the Isle of Wight studied at<br>Pembroke College in Oxford but never<br>completed his studies due to ill health<br>in fact that's why he was sent to Arturo<br>New Zealand rather than India I think so<br>clearly New Zealand agreed with him<br>he went to Australia where he was<br>ordained a deacon and as he did not have<br>a University degree he couldn't be<br>ordained as a priest but this changed<br>when Bishop Broughton of Sydney was<br>asked to visit aotearoa in 1839<br>he became the first priest to be<br>ordained here<br>he spent nearly all his missionary<br>service and waikanae and otaki 40 miles<br>north of here of Wellington rather his<br>geographical area of responsibility was<br>huge and stretched to include roughly<br>the bottom third of the North Island<br>the incident that we're considering<br>occurred 20 years into his missionary<br>service and concerned the unjust sale of<br>Maori land to settlers in taranaki<br>Hatfield with fluent and Maori and was<br>considered by Maori missionaries and the<br>government to be an expert in Maori land<br>ownership<br>he had also prevented a major Maori<br>attack on Wellington<br>he was considered a peacemaker friend of<br>the Maori and respected by some and the<br>colonial government by others he was<br>called a traitor and the most hated man<br>in New Zealand for his advocacy for and<br>defense of local Maori<br>so in this presentation I'll consider<br>the following issues land and Maori<br>responses Justice theological<br>anthropology the colonial logic of<br>mission and conclude with some learnings<br>so unusual among missionaries of the<br>time Hadfield was extremely well<br>informed on Maori understandings of land<br>he had spent 18 years studying native<br>titles to land and wrote a paper on this<br>subject for governor Sir George Gray<br>he was so incensed by the Injustice of<br>the sale of this particular tract of<br>land and taranaki that he wrote a series<br>of pamphlets to the Secretary of State<br>for the colonies<br>the first one of which was entitled<br>one of England's little Wars<br>when he excoriated in the strongest<br>terms the flagrant Act of Injustice by<br>the governor the ignorance of the land<br>Commissioners and the attack or little<br>war as he called it on the local Maori<br>Hadfield had learned that indigenous<br>attitudes to and ownership of land are<br>very different from English<br>understandings<br>however in the 19th century many<br>missionaries challenged the<br>understanding shared by indigenous<br>peoples about their sense of identity<br>their sense of well-being and their<br>relationship with the land creation and<br>place and I was speaking about this<br>yesterday in the lecture on whiteness<br>some of these early Europeans came to<br>new places which they defined in their<br>own terms and they designated in<br>categories familiar to them they divided<br>ancient tribal groupings their created<br>borders with straight lines they<br>developed racial categories<br>they challenged and destroyed the deeply<br>held beliefs and practices of indigenous<br>peoples<br>African-American Theologian Willie James<br>Jennings explains that the early<br>missionaries brought a very different<br>understanding of how to be in the world<br>and he wrote The crucial as crucial<br>educational Hope was to disabuse native<br>peoples of any idea that lands and<br>animals Landscapes and Seasons carried<br>any communicative or animate Destiny and<br>therefore any ethical or moral Direction<br>and how to live in the world<br>instead they offered peoples their<br>relationship with the world that was<br>basically one-dimensional<br>we interpret and manipulate the world as<br>we see fit taking from it what we need<br>and caring for it within the Logics the<br>logic of making it more productive for<br>us<br>for indigenous peoples we know that the<br>place is in them they are the place the<br>land and the nation and we know this<br>coming from aotearoa New Zealand where<br>Maori Define themselves according to<br>their place their Mountain their River<br>so just as in the Genesis creation<br>account indigenous myths of origin are<br>closely linked to the land and these are<br>a source of identity and orientation in<br>the world<br>enrolled member of the citizen<br>Potawatomi nation and professor of<br>Botany Robin wall camera explains this<br>indigenous worldview<br>she says for all of us becoming<br>indigenous to a place means living as if<br>your children's future mattered<br>to take care of the land as if our lives<br>both material and spiritual depended on<br>it<br>Tongan biblical scholar Dr Javier<br>explains how the land is gendered both<br>male and female for Island peoples and<br>the South Pacific<br>he writes as mother the land is the<br>primary carer of us<br>as father the land connects us to those<br>who have passed to one another and to<br>those who are to come and to the circles<br>of life around us<br>he also asserts that the colonial<br>project has feminized the land to<br>license its taking rape and exploitation<br>Jennings takes this further by claiming<br>that colonialism has resourced and<br>produced a Theology of extraction<br>supported by three crucial agents<br>necessary for that earth-shattering work<br>the merchant the missionary and the<br>soldier<br>this is clearly demonstrated in<br>hadfield's explanation of the unjust<br>sale of land and has led her to the Gen<br>then General Secretary of CMS Henry Vin<br>he wrote the government has taken<br>hostile proceedings against a chief<br>waramu kingi and his tribe because they<br>have resisted the survey of land which<br>belongs to them<br>but which an individual native Tiara has<br>sold to the government land agent<br>to my utter astonishment a few weeks ago<br>I learned that the governor had taken<br>troops to taranaki had issued a<br>proclamation authorizing martial law and<br>had marched troops onto the disputed<br>land and on the withdrawal of the<br>natives who were residing in paths quite<br>indefensible had destroyed these<br>in this instant Hadfield instance<br>Hadfield is the missionary who defends<br>the indigenous worldview and Advocates<br>on their behalf both to CMS and to the<br>British government in his series of<br>pamphlets to the Secretary of State for<br>the colonies<br>the merchant is the government<br>let the government land agent acquiring<br>land for the settlers<br>and the soldiers are sent by the British<br>government forcibly to subdue the Maori<br>and begin what Hadfield calls one of<br>is a Christian and a friend of Hatfield<br>he resolutely opposes the sale of the<br>land to the settlers and he writes<br>movingly to the governor and this is his<br>letter and the italics are his own<br>he writes I will not agree to our<br>bedroom being sold<br>for this bed belongs to the whole of us<br>and do you not be in haste to give the<br>money<br>do you hearken to my word<br>if you give the money secretly you will<br>get no land for it you may insist but I<br>will never agree to it all I have to say<br>to you o Governor is that none of this<br>land will be given to you never never<br>the Maori understanding of land<br>contrasts with the European worldview<br>that has so often reduced land to an<br>inert or utilitarian resource<br>for our own use<br>this is indeed an extraction worldview<br>whereas many indigenous cultures<br>practice more of a gift mentality<br>Maori Theologian Jay matanga writes that<br>the Maori world view is of a sharing and<br>gift economy<br>but that when industrialization was<br>imposed it was out of sync with Maori<br>souls and like most indigenous people<br>around the world it then proved a fast<br>track to poverty<br>and Martin reminds us of this spiritual<br>and emotional connection to material<br>reality just as Jesus had a relationship<br>with the created order where we see the<br>winds and the waves obeying him<br>martinga claims that private ownership<br>is not typical in indigenous ways of<br>knowing but it is endemic to Western<br>thinkers<br>so in this extract from kingy's letter<br>to the governor we see his personal and<br>familial attachment to the land it is<br>their bedroom<br>he's not interested in money because you<br>do not sell the family bedroom as it<br>belongs to everyone and no one person<br>has any right or desire to sell it<br>Hadfield understood and appreciated this<br>relationship with the land and he'd<br>assured the Maori that the British<br>government would never would unjustly<br>seize their lands<br>in this instance he later realized that<br>he that he had misled them and he was<br>therefore ashamed to meet with them<br>and kingy also declares<br>that this piece of land belongs to us<br>that belongs to the orphan it belongs to<br>the Widow<br>again we see here a deeply communal<br>understanding of ownership as well as<br>one which prioritizes those on the<br>margins and those at risk<br>this has striking resonances with a<br>Biblical understanding of the land and<br>how it can serve the poor and the Widow<br>such as in the Old Testament story of<br>Ruth<br>and as we have seen for Maori their<br>lives and their identity depended<br>fundamentally on their land<br>so they were not going to give up their<br>land easily nor were they prepared to<br>engage in violence<br>they were certainly not willing to<br>accept the investigation initiated by<br>the government on behalf of the governor<br>as Hadfield explained in his pamphlet<br>whose business is to purchase land and<br>who by the very nature of his office is<br>disqualified in the estimation of the<br>natives and partially to investigate<br>claims to land<br>however the governor quickly adopted<br>Colonial logic and sent soldiers on a<br>warship to deal with the situation<br>Jennings claims that this Triad of<br>merchant missionary and Soldier<br>reordered our sense of land animal plant<br>Earth and each other<br>through forming life into abiding<br>enclosure<br>this then led to new understandings of<br>boundaries identity and existence which<br>were then internalized<br>he writes the production of lines to<br>separate spaces that were in fact not<br>separate<br>took on a new economic determination as<br>the privatization of land and places<br>sliced through the forms of identity<br>both social and human<br>yet the line outside the body was also<br>the line within the body as people were<br>habituated to see the line that was not<br>in fact there<br>and internalized the line as a boundary<br>of existence<br>and this context in taranaki the lines<br>were literally being drawn by surveyors<br>marking out the land between their<br>surveying pegs<br>this was privatizing land creating<br>enclosures and taking away more than<br>just land<br>this was the literal slicing of identity<br>local Maori responded to these invasive<br>actions in a creative and subversive way<br>the women and children not only removed<br>the surveyors measuring pigs<br>but they also hugged the surveyors so<br>they could not do their surveying this<br>demonstrates their commitment to<br>peaceful protest in contrast to the<br>British response to send troops and<br>gunships<br>we also see here I think a fascinating<br>gendered response and a clever use of<br>bodies to thwart the surveyors<br>the governor then declared martial law<br>and when the local Maori refused to give<br>up their land a party of surveyors fired<br>the first shots followed by field guns<br>and Naval rocket tubes pouring a barrage<br>of shells at them<br>and so began the first wave of the land<br>Wars<br>Hadfield expressed his opinion to the<br>Secretary of State for the colonies in<br>the strongest terms possible he wrote<br>the governor's attack on William King<br>was not only in politic but under the<br>present circumstances of the colony an<br>act of folly<br>closely bordering on insanity<br>while Hadfield wrote a lengthy pamphlet<br>to the Colonial Powers local Maori took<br>both a personal and communal approach<br>I've quoted excerpts of King kingy's own<br>letter to the governor outlining his<br>refusal to sell the land<br>500 Chiefs also wrote a petition to the<br>queen imploring her to act justly<br>they wrote this unjust unjust conduct on<br>the part of a governor has filled us all<br>with grief and consternation<br>we are quite sure that your majesty has<br>not sanctioned the principle that land<br>is to be foresomely forcibly taken away<br>from your Majesty's subjects many of<br>them widows and orphans<br>for these reasons we your Majesty's<br>faithful and loyal subjects address your<br>majesty and pray that this Governor may<br>be recalled that this island may not be<br>involved in war and that your majesty<br>will send another governor who may know<br>how to govern in accordance with the law<br>and your Majesty's instructions<br>and that we and the white inhabitants<br>May dwell together in peace and love to<br>your majesty and we will ever pray that<br>your Majesty's sovereignty May prosper<br>oops May prosper<br>so it's noticeable that they appealed<br>they appealed to the queen believing her<br>to be the highest Authority and that<br>again they refer to the widows and<br>orphans appealing to a sense of justice<br>on behalf of the marginalized<br>they are clear that they want the<br>current governor removed because of his<br>unjust actions which resulted in a war<br>and twice they refer to prayer<br>the Maori approach is clearly communal<br>and invokes scripture by their reference<br>to widows and orphans<br>their worldview seems to have been<br>shaped by a Christian frame of reference<br>alongside their own indigenous cultural<br>values<br>for a settler Hadfield had an<br>unparalleled understanding of Maori<br>customs and culture with respect to land<br>ownership and he had an important role<br>in communicating and translating that to<br>the settler population<br>it's heartening and encouraging to see<br>his close friendship with kingy and his<br>support for him<br>however this was all framed within a<br>peculiarly British understanding of<br>Justice<br>so let's move on to consider that<br>as we've already seen Hadfield<br>immediately recognized and spoke out<br>about the Injustice of the British<br>possession possession of the land<br>his pamphlets on which we're reflecting<br>here are an attempt to highlight this<br>Injustice and they appeal to the British<br>government<br>hadfield's public condemnation of the<br>government reveals a bold and deep<br>commitment to his Maori friends<br>has tone as direct and demonstrates his<br>anger at the injustice<br>as this extract shows<br>he writes him in a flagrant Act of<br>Injustice has been committed by the<br>governor of a British colony in the name<br>of her majesty the queen<br>it is not easy to determine on what<br>course to pursue<br>if indeed an Englishman with a sufferer<br>either the courts of law or the public<br>press would afford a sufficient<br>guarantee that the Injustice would be<br>remedied<br>but when an Aboriginal Chief is affected<br>by such an act of Injustice neither of<br>these Avail him<br>he may be 200 miles distant from any<br>judge of the Supreme Court and he fails<br>to enlist the sympathy of the public<br>press<br>feeling deeply convinced that such an<br>act of Injustice has been committed by<br>Colonel Brown the governor of this<br>colony and has recent forcible expulsion<br>expulsion of William King from Land<br>inherited by him from a long line of<br>ancestors I venture to address Your<br>Grace as her majesty Secretary of State<br>for the colonies and to call your<br>as well as demonstrating his anger at<br>Injustice this extract also draws our<br>attention to the ways which Hadfield<br>views Justice<br>implicit in his writing is a belief that<br>the British government is committed to<br>Justice<br>and that a disclosure of The Facts of<br>the case would be enough to reverse this<br>unjust decision<br>however his confidence might seem<br>misplaced<br>perhaps an Englishman with a kind of<br>education and back free background as<br>Hadfield<br>might be able to expect Justice<br>but it wouldn't take much searching to<br>find a Litany of people who had suffered<br>Injustice because of the British<br>government within Britain itself<br>for example the Highland clearances for<br>which many of you may be very familiar<br>were taking place during this time in<br>Scotland and land enclosure in England<br>was taking land from common use to be<br>put into private ownership<br>English writer and environmental<br>campaigner Nick Hayes and Scottish<br>quater Quaker an activist for land<br>reform Aleister McIntosh as accounts of<br>these events demonstrates that this is<br>not a problem of distance from justice<br>but habitual practice of the British<br>itself<br>it appears that for Hadfield one of the<br>key problems facing kingy in the<br>displaced Maori is their distance from<br>the court and the difficulty they would<br>have in enlisting public sympathy<br>or to the British government can be<br>framed in a less hopeful light by<br>turning again to Jennings and his<br>Reflections on James's execution and<br>Peter's imprisonment in the book of Acts<br>chapter 12.<br>Jennings States<br>the prison always announces worldly<br>power and reveals those intoxicated with<br>the lust for violence<br>he does not mean the violence of the<br>inmate but the violence of the system of<br>the state and those in power<br>the prison is part of the storm's tools<br>of statecraft and Empire and the kind of<br>Justice offered by the prison is the<br>justice of King Herod not of Jesus<br>it's designed to silence opposition<br>and to bring pleasure to the political<br>and religious leaders<br>Jennings writes Christians like no one<br>else should understand how easy it is to<br>return to prison not because of human<br>failing but because of failed systems<br>that are calibrated against the<br>powerless the weak and the poor and work<br>best against Insurgent voices<br>pressing to systemic or pressing for<br>through Jennings readings of Acts 12<br>hadfield's Hope For Justice can be<br>interpreted as misplaced because of the<br>state's priority because the state's<br>priority is maintaining power not<br>Justice<br>it draws attention to the fact that<br>throughout the entire pamphlet Hadfield<br>Hadfield does not seem to doubt that the<br>route to justice is through the courts<br>and he does not appear to ask the<br>question of what a Biblical conception<br>of Justice might bring<br>as womanist scholar Audrey Lord has<br>reminded us the Master's tools will not<br>dismantle the Master's house<br>and here the tools of British Justice<br>will not reverse the Injustice of<br>British Empire<br>returning to Jennings and his<br>Reflections on Prison it's interesting<br>to note that the church's response in<br>Acts 12 is not to seek Justice from the<br>state but to turn to prayer as did the<br>500 Maori Chiefs in their petition to<br>the queen<br>we can see residences with a confidence<br>a white person would have on calling on<br>the police as compared for example with<br>a person of color<br>the Maori are much more aware of the<br>structures of power and Injustice and<br>while kingy seeks to appear on Monarch<br>to Monarch they know that the Justice<br>they seek is not given by the courts of<br>there might be another way to read this<br>we are assuming that the hepamphlet<br>expresses hadfield's feelings and<br>understandings<br>but this may not be true<br>and Community organizing for example saw<br>a links a linksky's fourth rule<br>as make the enemy live up to their own<br>Book of Rules<br>the have-nots make the haves live up to<br>their own rules<br>hadfields is a public letter and<br>therefore written with an audience in<br>mind<br>a more generous reading of Hadfield<br>would suggest he's trying to reveal the<br>acts of the British Empire for what they<br>are not the noble generosity of a<br>commonwealth but the smash and grab of a<br>criminal<br>it's one of a series of ways to shame<br>Swan opponents into acting justly to<br>show them the gulf between what they<br>claim and how they act<br>his letter could then be read as an act<br>of contextualization and of public<br>shaming<br>in some ways it's effective<br>the governor is removed but the<br>Injustice at the heart of the problem<br>the illegal taking of the land remains<br>unremedied<br>ultimately Justice was not done<br>the British Empire did not act justly<br>not only that as the many former places<br>of Empire the acts of the unjust unjust<br>are celebrated and even remembered by<br>having streets and memorials named after<br>them<br>whereas those mistreated uh forgotten<br>in many ways Hadfield can see can be<br>seen to be on the right side of history<br>but it's not clear whether these<br>experiences around Seeking Justice and<br>the lack of justice for Maori caused him<br>to question underlying assumptions about<br>moving on now to theological<br>anthropology<br>as we turn to reflect on hadfield's<br>theological anthropology another extract<br>from his pamphlet is helpful which shows<br>both his deep love and respect for the<br>Maori and at the same time an<br>understanding of indigenous peoples<br>which is jarring when read in the 21st<br>century<br>so he writes nothing but the deepest<br>conviction of the present critical state<br>of this colony and Colonel Brown's utter<br>in capacity to rescue it from disaster<br>and ruin has induced me to address your<br>grace<br>it is still possible that the presence<br>of some superior man might restore the<br>confidence that is lost<br>a little delay May occasion a war of<br>races<br>no doubt Great Britain has men and money<br>wherewiths to carry on against the<br>native race the war of extermination<br>but is this to be the issue of the<br>Endeavors to establish Christianity and<br>civilization among one of the most<br>intelligent and tractable of races<br>are we in the middle of the 19th century<br>to confess to the whole civilized world<br>that our Christianity and our<br>civilization have given us no advantage<br>over these people but that of a more<br>scientific use of material Force<br>is the pride of Englishmen to exclude<br>from the breasts all sympathy for a race<br>but recently emerging from barbarism<br>because its quality is too nearly<br>resembling their own<br>because it repudiates degradation and<br>refuses to be submissively trampled<br>underfoot<br>is the sound of War once again to deafen<br>and this is extract it's difficult to<br>unpick the seemingly paradoxical nature<br>of hadfield's theological anthropology<br>on the one hand he values his<br>relationships with the Maori and sees<br>the way that diversity enriches the<br>community<br>but in the next sentence he seems able<br>to name them as a formerly barbaric race<br>to do this he seems to draw on a kind of<br>British exceptionalism<br>he sees the British as a pinnacle of<br>civilization to which the Maori should<br>aspire<br>he appeals to this Pride naming it as a<br>reputation to be maintained not by<br>descending into war<br>but to be civilized<br>English Theologian John Hull explains<br>how the use of the Christian faith as<br>the ideology of the British Empire<br>changed and distorted theology in the<br>Christian faith<br>studying the sermons of chaplains to the<br>trading companies and the writings of<br>other theologians in the 16th century as<br>the British Empire began to expand<br>across the world he identifies this<br>distortion<br>one particularly Stark theme is to turn<br>to the Old Testament where he notes how<br>the political classes were attracted<br>more to the ideals of the Hebrew kingdom<br>than to those of the suffering Messiah<br>the justification became when a<br>Christian Nation conquers a<br>non-Christian Nation it is really Christ<br>who is the Conqueror<br>and led to a sense of superior<br>superiority of the faith of the English<br>over other colonizing Nations<br>according to Hull<br>these developments and the expansion of<br>the British Empire led to an emphatic<br>contrast between Christianity<br>and the dark savagery of the non-quest<br>Christian world<br>as the stark contrast plays out in North<br>America Hal notes the argument is simple<br>God has given the Earth to human beings<br>but the native peoples of North America<br>are not human<br>they are they are mere beasts<br>having dehumanized them any objection to<br>their colonization as void and the way<br>is cleared for Christian Britain to<br>follow the example of Joshua<br>the requirements of power and possession<br>shape biblical interpretation Christian<br>doctrine and the practice of Faith<br>rather than being challenged by them<br>so this tying together of civilizing the<br>Savage and the Christian faith is<br>clearly visible in hadfield's account<br>the underlying anthropology inherited<br>from the requirements of Empire shapes<br>his worldview<br>and a sermon on Maori Mission he<br>particularly sorry in a sermon on the<br>Maori Mission he points to their<br>degrading superstitions their<br>cannibalism the maintenance of a<br>particularly brutal form of savage<br>savagery slavery and infanticide<br>noticing human life was not valued very<br>highly<br>he then tells stories of how violent<br>Maori became peaceful civilized<br>Christians<br>this narrative maintains and reinforces<br>the binary described by Hull and it<br>feels particularly striking from the<br>21st century that he could use brutal<br>slavery as evidence of their barbaric<br>state with no reference to the equally<br>horrific Atlantic slave trade exploited<br>by the British not many years before he<br>was writing<br>interestingly in an article about the<br>chief tiruru uprahama he describes how<br>no careful Observer could fail to notice<br>the courage self-reliance and<br>Independence of the Maori<br>he Praises them for not being a<br>revengeful people and yet maintains the<br>language of savages<br>so this close attention allows him to<br>call into question some of the<br>assumptions about indigenous people in<br>the particular setting of the Maori but<br>it does not cause them to question his<br>own language and inherited exceptions<br>about indigenous peoples generally<br>he accounts for it within the logic of<br>the anthropology has he has inherited as<br>one of the most intelligent and<br>tractable of races allowing him to place<br>them on a Continuum a Continuum closer<br>to the Civilized end and an exception to<br>the rule rather than a debunking of the<br>happen if his deep friendship and<br>appreciation of the Maori had not just<br>caused him to look more positively on<br>this particular indigenous people but<br>also to begin to question the colonial<br>logic of how he was encouraged to look<br>at them in the first place<br>would it have been possible for his<br>friendship with many Maori to cause them<br>to ask questions about the colonial<br>logic under which his own missionary<br>Endeavor took place<br>all of the above shows how Hadfield<br>continued to operate in a logic of<br>Empire<br>this was a logic of land ownership of<br>private property of Courts and judges<br>significantly it was a logic which tied<br>Christian faith with British culture<br>this logic caused him to see aberrations<br>rather than a broken system<br>and in the argument over land he saw the<br>problem as corrupt individuals rather<br>than systemic<br>there's an implication that the Maori<br>need to be fully incorporated into<br>Empire<br>rather than Empire itself being<br>challenged<br>for example in one of England's little<br>Wars he briefly refers to the Kinga the<br>Maori King movement where a number of<br>tribes came together to try and elect a<br>king to oppose British rule<br>he Praises kingy's refusal to<br>participate and to stand for the crown<br>as one of the key reasons the uprising<br>failed<br>he appeals to kingy's loyalty to the<br>British Empire as one of the reasons why<br>this Injustice should be righted<br>having shown that in many ways<br>hadfield's Hadfield continued to operate<br>according to a logic of Empire rather<br>than argue for a binary assessment this<br>more complex account can be a means to<br>interrogate the Logics of Empire within<br>contemporary mission<br>as we identified at the beginning this<br>paper is written within the Empire and<br>we must avoid the temptation to suggest<br>that the answer is simply<br>to step outside the logic of our own<br>system<br>British Theologian Luke breatherton and<br>his careful study of capitalism points<br>out the naivety and the inherent<br>anthropology and assumption that some<br>Act of Revolution or some alternative<br>ideology will somehow restore order<br>he notes the need to resist rendering<br>contingent social political or economic<br>orders immutable and determinative of<br>what it means to be human<br>he argues that capitalism needs to be<br>unveiled as neither neutral or<br>inevitable<br>but that the answer is not Revolution<br>this assumption that it's possible to be<br>outside the system and untainted by it<br>fails to account for sin and domination<br>and it makes the same mistake of seeing<br>a temporal program as able to bring<br>really what only Jesus's return can<br>He suggests that what is required<br>theologically is both sober and radical<br>a Hope for Change<br>which seeks to convert and reconfigure<br>he writes redirecting its discursive and<br>structural apparatus to apparatus to<br>different god-given ends<br>this entails both recollection and<br>rupture being Salt and Light<br>conservative and radical continuity and<br>change<br>prophetic critique of what is and what<br>was as well as Messianic Hope For What<br>will be but is beyond human control or<br>determination<br>Jenning says something similar and his<br>Reflections in the book of Acts about<br>he says faith is always caught between<br>diaspora and Empire<br>it's always caught between those on the<br>one side focused on survival and fixated<br>on securing a future for their people<br>and on the other side those intoxicated<br>with power and possibilities of Empire<br>and of building World ordered by its<br>Financial social and political logics<br>that claimed to be the best possible way<br>what does it mean for Hadfield to be an<br>advocate friend and participant and to<br>live in between Empire and diaspora<br>some would like to convince us that<br>Revolution can overthrow Empire<br>as if some Utopia exists the side of the<br>eschaton<br>some would like to convince us that we<br>have to be a separate people a city on<br>the hill separate from the machinations<br>of Empire<br>and yet Hadfield attempted a Middle Road<br>Hadfield knew the complications and<br>complexities and he did this within the<br>logic of Empire of which he was apart<br>we cannot draw a simple line between<br>Empire and revolution<br>instead there is a need to embrace the<br>complexities<br>but even in saying all this it's clear<br>from our critique that while there is<br>much to learn from how Hadfield got this<br>right<br>there is also much to learn from how<br>Hadfield got this wrong his blind spots<br>assumptions and unwillingness to<br>question the logic from which within<br>which he lived<br>so we began this paper with a question<br>about whether Hadfield was a pioneering<br>profit or a complicit colonialist<br>hopefully by now it's clear that such<br>labeling is too simplistic and generally<br>unhelpful<br>and yet so often the Temptation is to do<br>to find a way of either justifying some<br>as good or writing them off as bad<br>but on raising questions about Hadfield<br>Our intention is not a simplistic<br>Judgment of history but to allow the<br>lens to be turned on us<br>in the 21st century<br>as we have shown Hadfield stood up to<br>the British Empire in a number of ways<br>he engaged in good practices of<br>cross-cultural mission<br>he developed deep friendships with Maori<br>and yet he also had blind spots to the<br>ways in which empire<br>shaped his practice and world view<br>as<br>a historian from this University Tony<br>Valentine has so definitely export<br>explored in his book entanglements of<br>Empire missionaries Maori and the<br>question of the body<br>relationship with the Empire and with<br>Maori is complex layered and really<br>straightforward<br>we are embedded in Empires and we are<br>not<br>the aim is not to discredit Hadfield nor<br>to hold him up as a model but to see him<br>as someone like us he has a complex<br>relationship with his political and<br>social context<br>so how can we learn from hadfield's<br>strengths and his blind spots about our<br>so while we may not feel that we are<br>part of blatant colonialist expansion we<br>are still entangled within the logic of<br>our day<br>we've already highlighted capitalism and<br>the complex relationship that Christians<br>and churches have with its particular<br>construction of what it means to be<br>human<br>we could add to that list money race<br>gender sexuality being differently abled<br>eurodiversity and climate change<br>we have suggested that hadfield's<br>encounter with difference through his<br>friendship with Maori raised awareness<br>of Injustice but that there was much<br>more to be opened up<br>similarly<br>we have suggested that a closer reading<br>of scripture alongside and with Maori<br>might have caused Hadfield to question<br>some of these underlying assumptions<br>which came through his writing<br>so if Revolution is not the answer<br>how might we open ourselves up to<br>difference and to scripture in such a<br>way to in the words of North American<br>Theologian Walter wink unmask the powers<br>in what ways are we complicit with<br>which dehumanize both us and others in<br>fact<br>what is the implicit anthropology in<br>capitalism and why is it that Society<br>seems unable to confront and deal with<br>climate change<br>similarly we might question the patterns<br>of Investments by Churches<br>we recently heard of Christian<br>organizations being encouraged to sweat<br>their assets<br>with initial theological reflection on<br>what exactly that might mean<br>but there's also a deeper critique to be<br>made church is investing in the latest<br>technology multi-million pound<br>refurbishments failing to pay a living<br>wage to their cleaners or importing the<br>logic of capitalism around Perpetual<br>growth into their Theology of the<br>Kingdom<br>we may feel like we are living<br>Faithfully but there are plenty of<br>voices encouraging us to listen more<br>UK minority ethnic Christians are<br>telling us that our structures and<br>patterns of ministry remain racist<br>racist<br>we need to listen carefully<br>people living in areas which will be<br>wiped out as sea levels rise due to<br>climate change are telling us this is<br>urgent<br>differently abled friends tell us that<br>they are tired of being marginalized and<br>overlooked<br>in many parts of our world and in our<br>own Society women still experience a<br>glass ceiling and feel unsafe not only<br>we are just as entangled in the empires<br>of today as Hadfield was<br>and if there's no option to step out of<br>it how can we be sober and radical<br>and be part of realigning it from the<br>inside and out<br>perhaps it starts by listening and<br>listening well<br>it may require painful exchange as as we<br>slowly learn how we continue to emulate<br>Empire<br>it may require learning other languages<br>both actually and metaphorically and<br>having friends that had fielded in these<br>varied and diverse communities<br>we cannot step out of Empire but we can<br>be exposed to its brutal reality<br>learn to live differently within it and<br>seek its conversion from both the inside<br>and out<br>thank you for listening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
