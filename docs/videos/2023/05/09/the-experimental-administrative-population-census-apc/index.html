The NZ Census has already adopted a combined model that uses administrative data to fill in any gaps left in the field enumeration. This approach was first used in 2018 when the field collection was faced with lower-than-expected response rates, and it is included in the 2023 Census by design, to ensure the final data is as high quality as possible. The experimental administrative population census (APC) is taking the idea one step further and examines the potential for census information to be produced from administrative data only.<br><br>The second iteration of the APC was released in October 2022. It is a time-series spanning 2006—2021 and covers demographic (age, sex, geography, number of children born), identity (detailed ethnicity, Māori descent, birthplace and years since arrival in NZ), as well as education, income, and work variables. The APC is designed to be released iteratively and provides data users the opportunity to provide feedback and be involved in its further development.<br><br>In this talk we will cover various technical aspects of the APC, highlight research opportunities it provides, describe areas of ongoing development, but also outline information needs that are not well covered in administrative data</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the APC is trying to do or what we're<br>trying to do with the APC to be more<br>clear is to to ask the question what if<br>we only rely on on admin data and so we<br>produce a census only based on admin<br>data um the first one released in 2021<br>and the second version in in 2022 and<br>this is really to understand the sources<br>better the admin data better and also<br>maybe sort of understand what would a<br>future look like in which we only rely<br>on Edmund data on Edmund data first to<br>derive census information and not<br>primarily on a survey<br>now all of this sort of use of admin<br>data to produce census information has<br>actually quite a long history<br>um it's going back all the way to 2012.<br>and with the start of the census<br>transformation strategy and with a<br>short-term goal and medium firm goal to<br>sort of modernize the then current<br>census model and the long-term goal to<br>actually look at this possibility that I<br>just mentioned about<br>um producing a census only based on on<br>admin data<br>um all of that got a bit more impetus in<br>2015 with a cabinet decision and there<br>was some other sort of experimental<br>outputs that all of this Builds on and<br>then relies on<br>um we didn't really call them a census<br>then they were just population estimates<br>um but they were basically the same idea<br>just growing adding on more variable and<br>variables and so on<br>as mentioned in 2018 admin data was<br>actually first used in the census<br>um to to fill in any gaps left by the<br>field enumeration<br>and then in 2021 we actually did release<br>the first ABC and last year the second<br>ABC and as you can see a bit of growth<br>there in terms of size I'm adding in a<br>lot more variables now I've also<br>mentioned on this slide that in 2021 and<br>there was the government starter<br>investment plan I'm stating with a<br>priority of producing more accurate<br>treatment measurements of the population<br>and also stats New Zealand's strategic<br>intention of 2021<br>um of less Reliance on Direct contact<br>and more data and better data for in<br>about Mari and the subtext of both of<br>these points being that an admin data is<br>one of the possible ways to hopefully<br>um go into that direction<br>um and finally and also as mentioned in<br>the 2023 census that's currently ongoing<br>actually does use admin data by Design<br>like from the beginning it was always<br>imagined to fill in the gaps and<br>everything has been set up in that way<br>but it's still using admin data as a<br>secondary source line primarily on the<br>field enumeration<br>so what are we trying to do with APC our<br>tagline is that we are a practical<br>demonstration of what can be achieved<br>now with admin data only to produce<br>census type information and I've<br>highlighted the three words that I think<br>are the most important there<br>um the now it's really just supposed to<br>be a research project a snapshot sort of<br>understand of how far we have come how<br>good we understand the admin sources how<br>good our methods are<br>uh it's relying only on on admin data<br>there's a bit of an asterisk there<br>because we do use census 13 information<br>to sort of fill in historic gaps but<br>rather think of that as historic admin<br>data rather than census data and finally<br>the one I think is most important it's<br>supposed to be practical demonstration<br>it really is supposed to look like a<br>census that the data has the same shape<br>and to help people understand<br>um the data and evaluate the data and<br>better<br>so the purpose to be a bit more detailed<br>um there's various wants and one of them<br>being to sort of gauge the technical<br>feasibility of an app and first sensors<br>and to enable a decision making on any<br>future model and sort of evaluate the<br>data and the methods it used in the APC<br>but also enable engagement<br>and then use that feedback from<br>engagement to sort of direct further<br>development now I did spell these out<br>because I think they explained some of<br>the design decisions we had to make<br>uh for example for the first two to sort<br>of assess how good the admin data is<br>that we have available and our methods<br>for example we made the choice of not<br>using census 80 information even though<br>it is there it is linked we could use it<br>it would probably improve the data that<br>we could produce a lot and fill in any<br>sort of gaps but it would give us the<br>wrong impression in some sense it was<br>sort of like lead to the wrong<br>conclusions and it wouldn't really<br>answer the question of how would it look<br>like if we primarily rely on Edmund data<br>because you'd always have the sort of<br>like safety net you never know how it<br>would look like without this um since<br>it's 18 saying saved in it<br>um and they did the last two in the game<br>will enable the engagement and and seek<br>feedback and for that I think that the<br>Practical aspect is really important uh<br>it was really designed to to elicit<br>these sort of conversations for people<br>to sort of look at the data and<br>understand the data and tell us what<br>they think<br>I think the nicest way of thinking about<br>it is to to think of the APC as a<br>conversation Catalyst like it really<br>sort of enabling these discussions<br>um about a possible change in the<br>well a bit more detailed or have we<br>produced in terms of data um so unlike<br>the sensors that only produces data from<br>one point in time we've actually<br>produced an entire time series from 2006<br>to 2021 and for each of these years<br>centering around the reference state of<br>the 30th of June just because it sort of<br>aligns with a lot of other outputs that<br>stats New Zealand has<br>and for each of these 16 reference<br>States we derive a admin-based New<br>Zealand resident population<br>um if you're familiar with some of the<br>sort of details<br>um this is known also it's basically the<br>same as what's been known as the IDI UB<br>in the past slightly more refined some<br>minor changes around the edges<br>and on top of that admin New Zealand<br>resident population we also had 19<br>census variables<br>um they are the ones about sort of that<br>you would expect population structure so<br>these are age six<br>um geography down to the address level<br>um usual residents in years ago to sort<br>of understand mobility and number of<br>children born for all females over 15<br>but then also importantly identity and<br>culture attributes and ethnicity if<br>you're familiar with the ethnicity<br>classification in use and that's<br>actually going down to the lowest level<br>and level four or the most detailed<br>level level four<br>um we also have Ari descent<br>um birthplace and for those who haven't<br>been born in New Zealand the year since<br>the Rival in New Zealand<br>and then three groups which we've added<br>in this last second inspiration that<br>we've released which sort of added a lot<br>to the growth and these uh income<br>um before we go on I should also say so<br>this was what the APC is<br>um I should also add and hasten to add<br>what the APC isn't so it isn't census<br>2023 that still relies on a field<br>enumeration yes you will well be aware<br>because I hope you've all filled out<br>your census form<br>um however having said that some of the<br>DNA is shared as I mentioned like some<br>of the census 23 model does use admin<br>data to fill in gaps the way this admin<br>data is condensed from the sources<br>available is of course sharing a lot of<br>the same ideas and the same methodology<br>and of course the admin sources to start<br>with are are shared<br>and the APC also isn't census<br>um 28 and that model hasn't been decided<br>yet it's not clear what that will look<br>like<br>um we're currently in the sort of phase<br>of making that decision as an<br>organization<br>but it's not too far-fetched to say that<br>again a lot of the sort of ideas and<br>then learnings from the APC will<br>actually inform the decision making and<br>then some of these ideas and<br>methodologies might actually end up<br>there again<br>and it also isn't official statistics<br>and this is a bit of a fine line to walk<br>because we're sort of trying to<br>encourage people to say here's our data<br>please use it but at the same time<br>here's our data please don't use it for<br>any sort of important decision making so<br>it's the sort of Fine Line<br>um to walk but overall it's actually the<br>data is looking reasonably good as<br>you'll see<br>and finally it also doesn't represent<br>all of the sort of research that is<br>going on all of the evidence used we're<br>exploring and there's a lot of bits and<br>pieces from census that are missing in<br>there you see things like dwellings<br>household and families there's this<br>whole area about population estimation<br>so this sort of adjustment layer where<br>we normally use like dual system<br>estimation techniques to to adjust for<br>under coverage in the senses like all of<br>these sort of prints and pieces and<br>parts research is going on I won't<br>really talk that much about them<br>in this<br>now from the beginning the whole APC had<br>been designed and conceived sort of an<br>iterative process that is it was always<br>claimed to have multiple iterations<br>multiple releases<br>and from year to year go out engage on<br>these releases engage on the data and<br>take the feedback that we have back and<br>then sort of feed it into the next<br>iteration and and of course we also did<br>a lot of sort of learning and then you<br>do understand that and data better and<br>you introduce improvements and the other<br>thing on this slide maybe to talk about<br>is what sort of data is available where<br>um so all of the APC is produced in the<br>IDI and in there in the IDI<br>um stats New Zealand's integrated data<br>infrastructure if you hopefully are<br>aware of that and what that is<br>who have IDI access<br>can actually access our unit record data<br>so we do sit there under the data and<br>schema and in all the unit record data<br>is available that has always been the<br>case<br>um One new edition this year is that<br>we've added a spells table meaning that<br>you're not sort of bound to that 30th of<br>June and reference State you can<br>actually produce the population and the<br>edit<br>um attributes for pretty much any any<br>day any reference State between 2006 and<br>2020 aren't there certain limitations I<br>don't want to go into details too much<br>we've also added some unit record<br>quality scores in the unit record data<br>so really each sort of attribute for<br>each unit record coming with a a score<br>of how good we think that particular<br>number or that particular value is<br>and also unnecessarily almost to add<br>we've also released our source code the<br>metadata to really help people<br>understand the data<br>now publicly available outside the IDI<br>and on the state's New Zealand website<br>um if you do Google stats New Zealand<br>and APC you'll you'll easily find us if<br>you only Google APC you'll end up at the<br>annual practicing certificate for nurses<br>so we haven't quite yet managed to<br>overwhelm Google but maybe one day we'll<br>come up as the first choice<br>um anyway outside on our website you'll<br>find a whole lot of sort of aggregate<br>tables<br>um released or taken from the IDI and<br>there's also an interactive app which<br>I'm going to mention in a second or talk<br>about a bit more<br>and there's a methodology report<br>um we've released one for 2021 and in<br>even more detailed one for 2022 and in<br>there there's also for information by<br>variable you'll find if you're<br>particularly interested in one of the<br>attributes and a lot of detail about<br>that variable a lot of quality<br>assessment<br>and<br>yeah just a whole lot more explanation<br>finally the the other thing we've also<br>released last year for the first time<br>was a condensed paper with information<br>for Mari again you can find that on the<br>website as well and containing<br>just the the parts of the APC that we<br>think is is of most importance to Mari<br>um and it's also hopefully a bit easier<br>to digest than the the rather technical<br>sort of methodology<br>and needless to say we also have plans<br>for the next iteration<br>um but more on that hopefully later<br>so if you go on the website<br>um<br>a few lines down on you you'll find this<br>interactive app that I mentioned<br>and it basically it looks like this<br>um there's a few tips<br>um the nicest view is probably the sort<br>of met you on the left side you can<br>select various things you can select the<br>year that you're interested in<br>um some of the covariants and of course<br>the attribute and then it will sort of<br>like display that information nicely on<br>a map of New Zealand and you can zoom in<br>you can switch on on roads so that you<br>can find your own area and as really as<br>I've mentioned before trying to<br>encourage people to to interact with the<br>data and to explore the data and helping<br>them to to understand the the data<br>better<br>um there's also a tab where you can look<br>at nice graphs sort of like development<br>over time and you can download specific<br>tables which is quite useful it's the<br>same information that's provided in the<br>summary tables and but it's you know<br>um of course because it's data that's<br>not unit record data anymore it's it's<br>taken out of the IDI and there's<br>somewhat limited crosstabs available so<br>you can't of course look at every<br>possible combination of Education income<br>um things you could do with the unit<br>record<br>um of course there's too many<br>possibilities to combine that with age<br>years and so on that we had to make some<br>some decisions of what are these sort of<br>like<br>and possible combinations<br>um are<br>all right maybe what have we learned so<br>far<br>um so the first thing is that and maybe<br>some it's a bit of a selection of the<br>things we've learned there's of course a<br>lot more detail to this as well<br>um the first one being that the<br>ethnicity information<br>um at least for level one and two is<br>actually a fairly high quality<br>and I'll go into a bit more detail on<br>some of the later slides<br>and the quality of Maori descent is not<br>quite clear yet and again there's more<br>detail coming up<br>um the tldr there is that the quality is<br>mainly driven by missingness so we are<br>missing values rather than for the<br>people for which we have information the<br>quality is actually quite high but<br>there's just a large group of people for<br>which we don't have this information and<br>format with data<br>um we've also learned in this spot<br>really come as a surprise that there's<br>definitely a need for deeper<br>consultation<br>um throughout the planning and<br>engagement periods and this this of<br>course needs to be slightly wider than<br>the APC all of the sort of movement of<br>States New Zealand towards an<br>organization that uses more and more<br>admin data<br>is<br>requires a lot of conversations and and<br>engagement and Beyond the APC<br>um really<br>um there's also one of the areas that<br>was is mentioned quite often is that<br>there is a potential for the inclusion<br>of ewe affiliation that's not currently<br>included<br>just in terms of sort of demand and this<br>is a frequently requested thing that if<br>we could possibly do that and that would<br>be great that sort of thing<br>um and finally and this is where we<br>might be hoping for a bit of feedback<br>today as well as I've mentioned<br>um we are sort of limited in the<br>crosstabs that we can provide um outside<br>of the IDI<br>um but there's just too many<br>possibilities so there we're really very<br>keen to hear if you have very specific<br>use cases in mind<br>um if you think there's certain<br>combinations that would be very very<br>interesting<br>um we'd be interested to hear to sort of<br>understand what data people are actually<br>um because we were just talking about<br>um ewe and Mari data needs in particular<br>uh<br>we do understand that the data needs of<br>ewe and Mari to some degree uh there has<br>been a paper about the Erie data needs<br>um and just going into some of the<br>details about that paper that you will I<br>guess be familiar with and we can pull<br>out a few points where the APC helps in<br>in that to sort of address these points<br>I'm not saying that it solves every<br>single problem and fulfills every single<br>data needed there obviously just making<br>the point that there are certain aspects<br>that you can see where the sort of<br>experimental work is already sort of<br>going into the right direction<br>um so that paper does mention and the<br>need for more timely more detailed and<br>more frequent<br>um data and measurement particularly of<br>the Maori populations and and that's a<br>definite yes as I mentioned we have data<br>for all years not just the census years<br>there's a lot more frequent data<br>available and it's also in some sense a<br>lot more detailed again details coming<br>up<br>um more relevant data again going to the<br>right direction some of the um up so<br>what the APC allows us to do because it<br>is part of the IDI as the sort of like<br>centralized point it allows the the<br>connection to other research<br>and sort of providing uniform<br>populations that people can base their<br>research on and hopefully able to make a<br>lot more research and comparable so<br>being the conduit that a lot of the<br>other research in linking can feed<br>um through<br>and yes how are you getting this data<br>what part of the audio are you using to<br>get this the startup or right okay and<br>skip a million slides don't worry<br>um<br>so we use quite a few data sources and<br>sources in the IDI basically all they<br>pretty much all of the ones that are<br>there that you can think of and the<br>details of this slide also don't really<br>matter too much I think the takeaway is<br>we use different parts for different<br>different attributes<br>um for example<br>um for getting birthplace and there we<br>rely on Dia data to see who's born in<br>New Zealand but we also rely on Customs<br>data and mbie and data Visa data to get<br>birthplace and condense those two for<br>that<br>attribute what about the Electoral roles<br>of any use uh it was on the list of<br>things to mention at some point during<br>this talk<br>um so so far we weren't allowed to use<br>the Electoral role for statistical<br>production and you were allowed to use<br>the Electoral role for one-off research<br>purposes<br>um however with the change with the new<br>data and statistic act that just came<br>into Force last year that replaced the<br>original 1975 Act<br>that actually does enable the use of the<br>Electoral role and we have started as an<br>organization to get hold of this data<br>sort of this sort of<br>understanding um ingesting the data but<br>we're still<br>um need to do the research of like<br>looking at the data seeing how it fits<br>in<br>um for example one of the places where<br>we do hope that it will help a lot of<br>the get filling the Electoral role is<br>for that Gap that Maori descent that I<br>mentioned before<br>um but just to mention detail there it's<br>a slightly different classification for<br>example on the Electoral roll it's a<br>it's a yes no question in the census<br>context we have yes no don't know so<br>there are some questions about how to<br>combine them and what the output<br>actually means and what it looks like<br>some details is that yeah that was good<br>all right<br>um now Renee specifically asked me to<br>comment on on the ethics of using admin<br>data that's all that's actually quite<br>nicely aligns with the question about<br>the the using electoral role<br>um now that's a very hard question to<br>answer I guess naturally I'd say that<br>that personally I think it's ethical to<br>do that since New Zealand obviously<br>things that's ethical to do that<br>and I think in general it's a question<br>that's probably not answerable as a<br>mathematician what I'm going to do is<br>probably answer a slightly different<br>question<br>um so maybe talk about some of the<br>aspects around it<br>um one of them is is the legality of the<br>whole thing as mentioned we just have a<br>new statistic statistics act<br>um so legally we're on very very Solid<br>Ground and it's not that the previous<br>act didn't allow the use of admin data<br>for statistical purposes and it was just<br>there was written in 1975 and it didn't<br>have a lot of things in mind like<br>digital registers and all of these<br>things it didn't mention data at all as<br>just as a word for example<br>um and the new Act is a lot more<br>modernized and and really enables this<br>use a lot better and for example it also<br>puts in an onus on the data suppliers to<br>inform stats New Zealand if they make<br>any changes to the way they collect<br>their data and things things like that<br>um another aspect to maybe mention is<br>it's not just a question about whether<br>it is ethical per se to use admin data<br>to produce statistical information<br>um it's also a question of whether the<br>production itself is done in an ethical<br>way<br>um so this is sort of linking up to to<br>aspects of privacy security<br>confidentiality<br>and again I think there we are on<br>reasonably solid grounds that states New<br>Zealand have very like<br>um well-established Protocols of you<br>know confidentializing data random<br>rounding perturbing suppression and<br>rules that we of course also follow<br>um with the APC and independently of<br>that the IDI has even stricter rules and<br>has its own rules<br>um and as we are producing as we are a<br>project in the IDI we have to follow<br>their rules and all as well and of<br>course<br>um there we adhere to those standards as<br>well so that is<br>framework that the IDI has developed but<br>that's a lot more general actually than<br>just applying purely to IDI<br>um research it's a framework that can<br>actually be applied to to more generally<br>to all sorts of data-driven research so<br>that covers aspects of<br>um<br>like are the people informed as the data<br>and safe hands or all of these um isn't<br>treated in a safe way all of these<br>um aspects<br>um and finally maybe uh mention trust<br>trust and confidence which is maybe the<br>slightly more important question rather<br>than is it ethical to do so will people<br>see it as ethical or have people do the<br>people of New Zealand have the trust and<br>confidence<br>and in data being produced by Edmund<br>data there my comment would be mainly<br>um that it should not really be thought<br>of as sort of like a one tick box<br>exercise where we have to gain the trust<br>and confidence license to do this sort<br>of thing and then it's fine I think it's<br>more of an ongoing process where this<br>this trust and confidence needs to be<br>um maintained and one of the ways to to<br>maintain this trust and confidence is is<br>hopefully by being transparent by as<br>we're trying to do with APC in<br>particular and to explain our methods to<br>make the the<br>algorithms available to really enable<br>people to look at and sort of like<br>understand what what we're doing<br>and and the other thing is I think most<br>of the trust and confidence will<br>probably actually come from producing<br>useful data I think most people are<br>probably quite happy<br>um for<br>um their data to be reused if they get<br>some if it's not seen as a one-way like<br>the government is collecting data and<br>then doing something with it but rather<br>it is<br>collected by the government for various<br>reasons and then we reuse it provide<br>statistics that are then useful again<br>for everybody and are provided to<br>everybody and again I hope that the ABC<br>does a little bit of that with<br>um providing as much data as we possibly<br>um all right getting maybe to a few more<br>um more data specific points<br>um maybe it's also interesting to to<br>just mention I was sort of like quality<br>measurement strategy like how we assess<br>the data what how we<br>or how we derive our sort of evaluation<br>and so this sort of breaks down in a<br>quality qualitative art and a<br>quantitative part<br>um qualitatively we've done quite a lot<br>of groundwork especially in the early<br>years if you think back of the second<br>slide that the history 2012 just<br>collecting information understanding how<br>is the data collected what is the<br>purpose of the collection because that<br>obviously uh<br>helps you understand<br>um the the data better and also what<br>happens in the ingestion process how is<br>it linked<br>um how can errors for example sort of<br>enter the system and all of these<br>questions<br>um quantitatively we rely on a few<br>metrics uh one of them being in coverage<br>like just if we have the population and<br>we have an attribute for how many people<br>in the population can we actually<br>produce this attribute<br>um there again hopefully the the higher<br>the better<br>in terms of numbers we can also compare<br>the the aggregate statistics that we can<br>produce with other statistics like the<br>ones that rely on 2018 sensors and that<br>being the reason not to include census<br>18 data for example so that we have this<br>independent list independent information<br>source of information that we can<br>compare with but of course also other<br>things like the estimated resident<br>population that we can hear our<br>population counts with<br>um and there's also other statistics<br>same Ministry of Education producing<br>some education statistics that we can<br>compare our numbers with to understand<br>that<br>um because we have census 18 as a unit<br>record file and we have all of our data<br>as unit record as well in the IDI we can<br>actually also do a unit record<br>comparison so we can really look at<br>specific<br>units and compare how well it's the<br>agreement that level<br>and that is another sort of measure of<br>how good we are how consistent things<br>are and of course that you can only do<br>in 2018 if you have a list to prepare<br>against<br>um and finally we've also derived some<br>other methods or we've experimented with<br>other methods<br>um we've been using one based on<br>Dempster shaper Theory I don't want to<br>go into details there but it's basically<br>just looking across different sources if<br>an attribute is available from different<br>admin sources how well is the agreement<br>within those sources and how well does<br>that agree with the value that we've<br>Chosen and again the more the agreement<br>there is the higher the score and the<br>lower so what that allows us to do is<br>sort of move Beyond<br>um 2018<br>and have some sort of score that also<br>works in in other years where you don't<br>have this list of arrogance<br>all right some data before I can show<br>you some graphs I have to show you the<br>IDI disclaimer<br>um<br>maybe starting with an overall sort of<br>quality because we were just talking<br>about the quality<br>um so that the main sort of measurements<br>being the missingness and the<br>consistency with 2018 comparing on a<br>unit record level data<br>um and then basically multiplying those<br>two numbers to get an overall output<br>score for the whole population for that<br>attribute<br>and too many numbers to ingest<br>um the thing to mainly look at if you<br>look at the second column and so this is<br>the consistency so this is or where we<br>have a value how good is the value how<br>well does it agree with a census<br>response and overall as you can see the<br>agreement is actually reasonably high<br>with a few outliers but those won't<br>really surprise you for example and me<br>lays is quite a tricky ethnic group<br>conceptually and the other ethnic group<br>at level one<br>um is is very very small and also<br>conceptually somewhat tricky so it's not<br>that surprising to see a bad consistency<br>there<br>and what mainly drives the outcome<br>quality is is actually the missingness<br>and there I highlighted that<br>aforementioned again in Maori descent<br>where for 14 of the population we don't<br>actually have a value<br>um at all but again for the ones where<br>we have a value it's actually the<br>quality is is quite High<br>this is only comparing<br>pleated since 2018. yes yes<br>yes when we come here<br>but um<br>there is actually an<br>a denominator<br>yes so the missingness is is within the<br>APC<br>So within the ABC population<br>um there's 14 for which we can't fill<br>the Maori descent<br>um value<br>um<br>there's also missingness in the senses<br>so this is just<br>of the people who are in the APC and at<br>the same time have answered since it's<br>18 how good is the agreement for that<br>Overland<br>and then of course making the slight<br>leap of faith of assuming that that is<br>more generalizable to other people in<br>the APC um so you've got you've got<br>people who will be in your ABC yeah<br>who were<br>in 2018 census because they were drawn<br>from the admin yes that's the second<br>Point uh I should have came the second<br>thing I should have added as well when I<br>say comparison with census 18 and we<br>only compare with<br>um the the response the true not not the<br>true responses and the the field<br>enumeration responses we obviously built<br>out any any of the things that had been<br>filled in with admin information because<br>otherwise yes it would be quite funny we<br>would be comparing since admin<br>information with um admin information<br>um but can you trust this data when the<br>quality of the 2018 census wasn't very<br>good so you're producing data here based<br>on a census yeah I guess if you say that<br>the quality of the 2018 census wasn't as<br>good I think it's almost like a similar<br>picture is here I think what most people<br>probably think about is that the<br>response rates were far lower than we<br>would have hoped for so it is it is also<br>like a missingness problem rather than<br>um I think saying that oh that was<br>conducted in such a bad way that people<br>like didn't fill it in properly I think<br>of the people who did answer the 2018<br>census I think we can make the<br>assumption that that is very very high<br>quality data that is<br>um the right response I think the<br>problem with the quality is more<br>the missingness the people who didn't<br>answer the census to start with<br>and and then the quality assessment of<br>the admin data that was used to backfill<br>the census<br>which is slightly different to the<br>Quality assessment that you have here<br>yeah<br>that's derived from from spatial units<br>it's not based on a general<br>New Zealand scalpers this thing that<br>what do you mean by that<br>well you you you're calculating the<br>population Maori for different area<br>units right<br>so so this comparison here as I said<br>like the the second column is is on a<br>unit record level so this is actually<br>taking individuals and their admin data<br>that are linked to individuals in the<br>senses and comparing that on that<br>um level because we so of course we can<br>also do the geography to this so can you<br>map out where you got the missing data<br>or now yeah yeah yeah of course and this<br>is some of the country where is it<br>missing yes<br>um<br>um Queenstown<br>is particularly bad a lot of the Maori<br>descent missingness is actually driven<br>by um the overseas population which<br>conceptually makes sense because it's<br>that actually brings me to the next<br>slide again our Mario descent is derived<br>and so we're mainly there like for many<br>other attributes we're relying on on<br>sort of like ranked methods where we<br>have analyzed the the sources that are<br>available and sort of take the best<br>available source and if there's no<br>information available from the tools we<br>sort of start relying on the next one<br>so for Mario in this end we don't<br>actually have that many admin sources<br>available as you mentioned electoral<br>role would be fantastic one to have<br>hopefully<br>um but we do have Dia data it is a<br>question there whenever you're born and<br>if you ever have a child as a parent you<br>get asked that and so we take the DIA<br>response there and prioritizing parents<br>response over the the children<br>um because we do want to to<br>um prioritize<br>um responses over proxy responses rather<br>than you know somebody filling it in or<br>their child it's not the child itself<br>answering that question it's somebody<br>else filling in order<br>um so if we have information from DIA<br>where you were a parent<br>um for the Maori descent attribute we do<br>use that if not maybe we have your your<br>birth register uh as a child we use that<br>and that gets you to 49 of the<br>population<br>now that has only been started uh that<br>information has only been collected<br>since 1995 So for anybody who was born<br>before 1995 or didn't have a child after<br>1995.<br>um we do need to get this information<br>from somewhere else and here we<br>immediately fall back of the sort of<br>like historic admin data of of census<br>2013 and that obviously fills a large<br>gap there and that gives you two gets<br>you to 85 percent<br>basically you're missing all the people<br>that go overseas and all that yes yes<br>exactly so so the main it's mainly<br>driven the missingness here is by the<br>overseas spawn population and that<br>hasn't had a child in New Zealand<br>um so again like we do understand the<br>missingness problem quite well uh we do<br>have some hope or we do have a lot of<br>Hope in the Electoral data is sort of<br>like sustainable going forward something<br>that will be filled in by it by most<br>people better than Revenue this is<br>whatever job wouldn't they um they don't<br>so don't don't you have like a an ID for<br>each person when you can cross-link them<br>and all that<br>it's like<br>well there's linking down this<br>probabilistic linking done in in the IDI<br>um but yeah for somebody who's born<br>overseas even if all of the data sets<br>are linked none of the data sets<br>his Maori descent available for that<br>person<br>no no<br>um so this goes back to to talking about<br>the um the the this is what we can<br>achieve now with deriving<br>um census information from admin data<br>there is of course the potential to<br>maybe go to the Ministry of Education<br>and then ask you know and then get them<br>to start collecting this information<br>um for I think tertiary students they<br>already collect<br>kiwiation for example<br>um so it would be quite natural to also<br>collect that information and but that<br>doesn't help us right now that might<br>help us so you're saying education<br>health benefits the information<br>simplicity<br>okay<br>um ethnicity same same picture as before<br>and I'm terribly running out of time<br>um but ethnicity is actually we're quite<br>a luxurious position because there are a<br>lot of different admin sources available<br>it is collected by a lot of different<br>so many ethnicities let's say you are<br>taking you are defining in the APC that<br>they're sitting you're taking it from<br>say five different sources and if all of<br>them have saved for some reason<br>different ethnicities for one person so<br>is that person counted in each of those<br>ethnic groups so again we were using a<br>ranked method in that we've sort of like<br>ranked the sources and for every person<br>we sort of go through the sources look<br>is it available in DIA<br>is it available in Ministry of Education<br>tertiary data is it available in<br>Ministry of Health and then until we<br>sort of run out of sources and at the<br>end we use 2013 to sort of fill in any<br>gaps according one ethnicity for each<br>person<br>no we we collect all of the ethnicities<br>that are selected in in<br>a source<br>because each of these sources might will<br>collect multiple ethnicities<br>right<br>um we have also been doing some research<br>of slightly breaking that that pattern<br>there there's some research we've done<br>on using latent class modeling<br>um more like methods that look at all of<br>the sources at the same time and I think<br>there is definitely scope or Improvement<br>but and maybe that is something to sort<br>of finish on two or two slides is that<br>the data actually looks looks quite good<br>so here's only the the Mari ethnicity<br>usual resident population I'm comparing<br>the counts in 2018 from the ABC<br>um with the 2018 census counts and in<br>with the adjusted that's the yellow line<br>the estimated resident population that<br>adjusts using the post enumeration<br>survey for under coverage in the census<br>um and I mean there's some there's<br>obviously some differences here but<br>overall I think it's quite reassuring of<br>how close the these patterns really are<br>so it's it's safe to say that all of<br>these measure the same concept<br>um having said that there are some fine<br>distinctions for example you can see<br>here that the<br>um APC seems to be missing some of the I<br>think this is like sort of like 15 to 19<br>year olds<br>um doesn't have as much problem as<br>sensors to pick up the 20 to 30 year old<br>so there's these fine sort of nuances<br>how does this graph look at uh<br>sub-reasonal level because I'm assuming<br>yes it's as you go so this is also just<br>the the national<br>um picture if you start going down<br>breaking it down by say geography<br>mtalbs regions sa2s and so on of course<br>you you'll see a lot more variation as<br>you would expect<br>similarly<br>really importantly at the more finer<br>grade level for the ethnicity data for<br>the noticed population<br>um you know it's quite concerning that<br>one of your hierarchies for ethnicity<br>data is probably in secondary Ministry<br>of Education data because that ethnicity<br>data is<br>really poor quality<br>um and it's not collected I mean we're<br>still undergoing the ethnicity<br>standardization<br>um process which will be really<br>important but at the moment it's not<br>uh it's not that it's not even the<br>standard census question in those data<br>sources<br>it is is this so so these have been<br>ranked in in how well they agree with<br>census 18.<br>um so so<br>just overall one yes uh this is uh yes<br>but the ranking is done on us okay<br>um there's a lot more to say there's a<br>lot more scope for improvement but<br>overall the the agreement is maybe<br>surprisingly um High maybe I can show<br>you another<br>um<br>slide with graphs<br>um so this is<br>um the the quality of the<br>um Pacific ethnicities at level two and<br>three um leaving out the the other sort<br>of categories<br>and again you can see that the count<br>from sensors in the APC are actually<br>remarkably loads um even if you break it<br>down by five year age groups except for<br>that VG except for one and this is the<br>sort of analysis that we're doing and<br>this is why we're doing it and it's sort<br>of like understanding these things and<br>there we do actually know or we think we<br>know what's going on and this is<br>probably something to do with the way<br>that um ethnicity is collected say at<br>Ministry of Health at the GP and because<br>there's not just the PGM category<br>there's also the PG and Indian category<br>which is sitting in a different<br>um setting under the Asian ethnicity<br>classification<br>um so what is happening there the over<br>count will probably be a lot of Fijian<br>Indians being counted as Fijian in<br>adminate and again sorry the denominate<br>us the comparison the 2018 census<br>comparison here is those that completed<br>the 2018 census<br>um<br>so so these are now not unit record<br>um information anymore this is now the<br>aggregate information so this will be<br>including the admin field including<br>statistical imputation<br>okay so you're including those that<br>whose 2018 Census Data comes from Advent<br>data<br>yes so some agreement there will happen<br>however I mean even though 2018 response<br>rates were<br>rather low it is still like at least I<br>mean again depending on the ethnicity<br>specifically so it's really hard to talk<br>to look at this comparison where you<br>didn't use the admin data in the 2018<br>census included that's the comparison<br>yeah then then you obviously you'll see<br>um the Census Data being a lot lower<br>then I guess the fear of comparison<br>would be in terms of of distribution oh<br>in the proportions well that would be a<br>fair comparison what you're saying here<br>is that our admin data is just as good<br>as our 2018 Pizza starter without saying<br>but for around about a third of the<br>Pacific population and again higher for<br>people too yeah you're comparing your<br>admin data you could filter those out<br>this was<br>Daniel what suppose us to the tree well<br>we don't have the truth yeah I know so<br>yeah<br>all right I think in the interest of<br>time<br>um I I as you might expect and as you<br>might have seen I have a million slides<br>or maybe if you allow me to show one<br>more slide of the sort of things<br>um which are quite exciting which we can<br>do so there's a lot more frequent data<br>and basically have a census<br>as often as you'd like you could have a<br>quarterly census you could run this this<br>process and then produce census<br>information more data than you could<br>hopefully ever hope to analyze one of<br>the interesting things we haven't<br>mentioned yet is that it's not just that<br>there's more frequent data available but<br>it's all longitudinally linked on a unit<br>record data level and that is something<br>we haven't really explored that much but<br>that allows you to look at things that<br>you couldn't really look at with the<br>additional way<br>um we've used census information so you<br>can't just look and here's an example<br>between Hamilton and Tauranga you can't<br>just look at how many people lived in<br>Tauranga over the years how many people<br>lived in Hamilton<br>for each of the reference States you can<br>also see how many people actually moved<br>from one year to the other from Hamilton<br>to Tauranga and the other way around<br>even though in the aggregate numbers<br>they would cancel each other out<br>um I'm not sure if this is a<br>particularly interesting pattern but yes<br>so uh I've been taking back of my mind<br>that this APC is kind of finding a New<br>Zealand version of what would be called<br>population registration data in uh<br>Scandinavian the Netherlands which have<br>familiar with now um actually this is<br>what can be more powerful because<br>there's a limit to what these<br>registration systems collect but on the<br>other hand they are and they have their<br>incentives for people to register or<br>de-register because if you don't<br>register you don't get any Services if<br>you don't deregister like for example I<br>lived there in recent years uh if we<br>hadn't deregistered<br>um and therefore<br>signaled our migration leaving the<br>country we would have continued to have<br>to pay taxes so um the question in this<br>context and I'm particularly interested<br>in is something really hard in the past<br>and you've seen getting to grips with<br>immigration people leaving New Zealand<br>uh and by and different spatial levels<br>which listen<br>yeah just always a residuals yeah<br>um you know what as people have been<br>demographically calculating that<br>immigration residual but you have<br>something to you all right yes it could<br>basically easily identify people who<br>have emigrated and then because of this<br>reiterating for the millionth time it is<br>like having the the entire information<br>available you can start analyzing this<br>and look at the age structure look at<br>the education level like all of these<br>things you could easily do like it's<br>it's mentioned like we've only sort of<br>starting to scratch the surface of the<br>things that are really possible with<br>but I think I should probably stop at<br>this point I'm more than happy and we<br>are more than happy to hang around and<br>then continue any conversation but I<br>think before<br>generally seems to be there's an overall<br>well it again it depends like what<br>attributes is is useful I think Dia or<br>my theory would be that<br>um it's if you have a child it's such a<br>like momentous event that you do sort of<br>like you know take care and filling out<br>the forms and you really start to think<br>you know this is that they're going to<br>carry around for the rest of their life<br>because when I put some effort into<br>thinking what ethnicities do I want to<br>write down slide 29 has one<br>they wouldn't know if you leave the<br>country or not<br>no but that doesn't matter does it it's<br>everything's linked That's The Power of<br>it yeah okay I just want me I would have<br>thought Health would be pretty good<br>because everyone most people bridges on<br>the health status pretty quickly I I<br>think you really have to break it down<br>for what you want to use the data for<br>like we use for example Health as an<br>activity<br>um check Signs of Life to to make sure<br>um to sort of filter<br>that the Edmund population and and there<br>yeah it's very good because people do<br>interact with the health system quite<br>often<br>um some of the ethnicity information for<br>example from health is is known to be<br>slightly problematic<br>so it really depends of what you use<br>that for this goes back to what I've<br>said in life it is really important to<br>understand your sources and to<br>understand what they're collecting the<br>data for and thereby informing how we<br>can reuse the data<br>this is not used to if I act like a<br>population registered but it's not a<br>population register it hasn't been set<br>up that way and now admin sources that<br>are being used as the source for this<br>register haven't been set up as<br>uh and so you know you you didn't really<br>discuss the data sovereignty<br>considerations but you know the data<br>sovereignty considerations include not<br>only the governance over this so it'd be<br>really interesting to understand if<br>that's connected to to the governance<br>um that needed to be put in place with<br>the 2018 census challenges and then also<br>includes that interpretation challenge<br>so it it's absolutely critical that<br>everybody understands the limitations of<br>the sources of the data of the IDI but<br>nobody does so I sit on the health<br>research Council public health committee<br>and we have a process underway with our<br>Ethics Committee for the health research<br>Council looking at whether what the<br>implications are for IBI research to do<br>health research and the number one<br>implication is that the vast majority of<br>applications to do health research that<br>that state that they're going to use the<br>IDI don't actually understand the data<br>sources of the idea AI that they're<br>planning on using and the limitations of<br>those so there's data are typically<br>deficit and also they're collected in a<br>very uh very different way to what a lot<br>of the research questions are that might<br>want to use the APC you might want to<br>use the idea so it is really important<br>that we have that social license<br>conversation that we have that<br>governance compensation and that we<br>understand<br>that creating such a resource might be<br>fabulous but it might really also<br>stimulate additional deficit based<br>um framing of outcomes particularly for<br>Maori and Pacific and their ethnicity<br>pieces is really important<br>and I think there's another question<br>Jamie Beal asked a question and also<br>about about you know important<br>populations and how they may or may not<br>be represented in<br>what are your plans to collect data<br>about rainbow communities with Edmond<br>does actuality General transgender<br>status<br>that was mentioned in one of the slides<br>as is one of the sort of like blind<br>spots currently<br>um States New Zealand has developed a<br>standard<br>um I think that's been some of the<br>previous years<br>um and it's it's the sort of like data<br>system leadership role that says New<br>Zealand has has sort of pushed it out to<br>other agencies to start collecting it<br>and the information is obviously also<br>for the first time collected in the 23<br>census<br>uh in terms of admin data you of course<br>have a bit of a lag there in that it<br>hasn't been collected to this point and<br>it's sort of like it's it's hard to see<br>like what how it's been collected by<br>what agency<br>what has been done to it until we sort<br>of see the data<br>um where was I going with it<br>um so so there's<br>the groundwork has been laid in some<br>sense and but of course to to start<br>seeing this in admin data will take<br>quite a long um time so this might be<br>some of the information that for some<br>time might need to be collected um in a<br>foreign<br>whanau<br>no we might<br>um<br>blows off from now and continue this<br>conversation here in the room<br>um yeah so we'll call it a conclusion I<br>was wondering the same question is<br>Richard said will the Public<br>Presentation be available and if so how<br>would we get our hands on totally okay<br>so so just to kind of wrap up thank you<br>for um attending everyone absolutely the<br>slides and the recording will be on our<br>tenyatta<br>website.ac.nz uh so yeah you can find<br>that by just Googling team<br>um if you know of any of your friends or<br>colleagues that might like to join our<br>mailing list who have invitations to<br>Future seminars please also find my<br>contact details on the tiniera website<br>um so what I'll do now is I think I'll<br>finish recording I think there's going<br>to be a little bit more of recorded or<br>going on in this room if anyone wants to<br>leave you online uh version please do it<br>if you want to stick around to listen</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
