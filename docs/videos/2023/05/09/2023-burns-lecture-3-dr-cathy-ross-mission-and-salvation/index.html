Facebook<br>Messenger function<br>so before we begin this evening let's<br>a<br>honor and glory to God<br>peace on Earth and Good Will to all<br>people<br>create O Lord in us a new heart in all<br>of us<br>instill in us your Holy Spirit<br>help and direct all of us so that we may<br>learn what we need to this evening<br>amen<br>thank you and uh<br>good evening everybody thank you for<br>your patience and to those of you online<br>I think we've got the tech issue sorted<br>so tonight I want to think about<br>salvation<br>another world is waiting Mission and<br>salvation who then can be saved<br>and I've entitled to perspectives on a<br>lived Theology of Salvation among fresh<br>Expressions communities in Britain<br>so this paper this presentation is a<br>result of some research that I did with<br>my colleague Dr James Butler last year<br>and we wrote this paper together<br>actually<br>Lynn said that when she introduced me<br>for the first lecture that I like to<br>co-write and co-edit and it's really<br>great working with colleagues I prefer<br>actually<br>are researching and writing with<br>colleagues with somebody because you<br>know two heads are better than one and<br>you have Rich conversations and ideas<br>emerge even in the conversations that we<br>have together so James and I did this<br>research and wrote it up last year and<br>looking at how salvation is understood<br>and emerging communities of fresh<br>expressions in England<br>and for those of you unfamiliar with the<br>term fresh expressions<br>they are a form of church for our<br>changing culture established primarily<br>for the benefit of people who are not<br>yet members of any church or another<br>word might be missional community so<br>there's a whole Spectrum that's covered<br>by fresh expressions and if you're<br>interested you can look it up there's a<br>whole website that explains to you in a<br>lot more detail<br>so as researchers and teachers James and<br>I are committed to paying close<br>attention to lived practice<br>and our Theology and research<br>our approach comes to the conviction<br>that the lived practices of fresh<br>expressions are themselves theological<br>and speak into a wider conversation<br>and Theological action research which we<br>are both committed to sees the process<br>of qualitative research as recognizing<br>the interrelated nature of theological<br>voices<br>particularly the four voices the formal<br>normative operant and espoused I'm not<br>sure if you're familiar with this but<br>they're a kind of device to help us<br>identify the theology embedded in<br>practices<br>so the formal voice is the voice of<br>formal theology<br>the normative voice refers to the<br>scriptures Creeds and official Church<br>teaching<br>the espoused voice as what a group says<br>they believe while the operant voice is<br>the Theology of their actual practices<br>the theologies embedded in the group I.E<br>what they actually do<br>so as these voices are recognized<br>together new moments of disclosure can<br>occur<br>so to pay attention to practice we ran a<br>focus group with members of a boxing<br>community<br>um and we interviewed a member of a<br>classic car community and we interviewed<br>a member of a sewing Collective<br>these are all communities led by people<br>of Faith ordained and lay<br>the boxing Community developed on an<br>estate among those with a love for<br>boxing the classic car Community appeals<br>to Classic Car enthusiasts and the<br>sewing Collective<br>attracts commercial sex workers in the<br>city in the north of England<br>and we also ran two further focus groups<br>with leaders of fresh Expressions all<br>the names are pseudonyms and the names<br>of the groups have been removed so when<br>I refer to people's names they are<br>pseudonyms so these are all if you like<br>missional communities or fresh<br>expressions<br>so over our years of teaching and being<br>involved in fresh expressions<br>we have noticed a recurring question<br>which but is this church<br>this has been a regular question<br>initially targeted at those articulating<br>a theological basis of fresh expressions<br>and now more commonly aimed at those<br>involved in fresh Expressions as a call<br>to justify themselves<br>it's interesting to us however that the<br>question of Salvation is not one that<br>has been raised so frequently<br>Dutch missiologists Stefan pass and Hans<br>Schaefer in a paper they wrote recently<br>entitled reconciled community on finding<br>a soteriology for fresh expressions<br>ask why there's been so just attention<br>given to this question of soteriology<br>and fresh expressions<br>and their suggestion that is that that<br>it's a combination of speechlessness<br>about religion and Western secularized<br>societies<br>theological embarrassment of an<br>Evangelical soteriology that fresh<br>Expressions have left behind and a lack<br>of deep theological pockets is<br>persuasive<br>they argue that fresh Expressions have a<br>social or communal soteriology<br>as does Philip Philip wall who has also<br>paid attention to soteriology and fresh<br>expressions<br>he adds that while soteriology<br>particularly with an evangelicalism has<br>a strong otherworldly Focus fresh<br>Expressions also bring a present Focus<br>to Salvation<br>and North American Theologian Brian<br>Stone makes a similar turn to a communal<br>soteriology and his work exploring<br>evangelism in a plural society<br>and he also argues it's necessary to<br>avoid making the church subordinate to<br>Mission<br>so our this presentation Builds on this<br>turn to a communal and present focused<br>soteriology through this qualitative<br>research program project with members of<br>Three fresh expressions and then further<br>discussions with leaders of fresh<br>expressions<br>and here we reflect on the themes which<br>arose in the conversations with our<br>participants and then we draw out some<br>insights for a communal soteriology<br>We Begin by identifying this communal<br>soteriology within the communities<br>themselves and identifies some of the<br>key practices for this<br>we then turn to the fruits of this<br>communal soteriology exploring the<br>difference these communities have made<br>and we address the question of whether<br>this is simply a collapse into imminence<br>and to contemporary well-being culture<br>first through exploring articulation and<br>then drawing on one of the most<br>significant themes to come out of these<br>communities which is prayer<br>and we conclude by drawing together the<br>learning from these communities to<br>discuss how a focus on lived satireology<br>offers A New Perspective on the cones of<br>ecclesiological questions which have<br>dominated the conversation around fresh<br>expressions<br>so firstly communal salvation<br>many of the people we talked with in our<br>research had had little connection with<br>church before they became involved with<br>fresh expressions with these fish<br>expressions<br>Sarah from the sewing Collective was a<br>particularly interesting example<br>she had led a difficult and chaotic life<br>she'd struggled with addiction<br>homelessness and self-esteem issues<br>for her one of the words she used most<br>in her interview was connection<br>and she comments as much as life has<br>been a struggle it's been blessed as<br>well you know because of my downfalls I<br>feel more blessed because of the<br>connections I've made and other I've<br>made to the people and other people in<br>relation to Jesus and God<br>you know that connection helps bring me<br>closer as well<br>Sarah the welcome and support she<br>received were an important part but what<br>she kept returning to were connections<br>for her these connections to others and<br>connections to Jesus were interrelated<br>and demonstrate an experience of a<br>communal soteriology<br>this interconnected nature of the<br>community bringing people closer<br>together and to God was also noted in<br>the boxing community<br>so Gareth commented<br>we'll keep it going not only just for<br>the boxing side of things but also for<br>the community side of things<br>and that there'll be a couple of people<br>there that will keep it going for the<br>faith side of things it's not just one<br>aspect<br>relationships God physical and mental<br>well-being spirituality all seem to<br>overlap in the experience of the boxing<br>community<br>there was not a strong focus on<br>individual conversion although some did<br>talk about becoming Christians and a<br>member had been baptized<br>and all three communities it was the<br>integrated sense of community faith and<br>life which was appealing to the<br>participants<br>so a key Insight from pass and Schaefer<br>is drawn from the loving first journey<br>developed and explored by English<br>Theologian Mike moyna<br>it identifies how fresh Expressions<br>often develop through a process of<br>listening loving and serving building<br>Community exploring discipleship Church<br>taking shape and then doing it all over<br>again<br>this has been a helpful guide for fresh<br>Expressions as they have developed<br>pass and Schaefer pick up on this<br>process as valuable path and shape for<br>pick up on this process and their paper<br>and claim that if as moina asserts each<br>stage of this process is valuable in its<br>own right for Community Building not to<br>be instrumentalized to the service in<br>the service of making disciples then<br>these must be two sides of the same<br>soteriological coin<br>salvation is not primarily an individual<br>experience but a communal one where the<br>community Journeys together and<br>salvation is seen as more of a process<br>than an event<br>Parson Schaefer summed this up quite<br>clearly<br>the theological assumption is that God<br>is at work wherever a reconciled<br>Community is in the process of being<br>created and that salvation is happening<br>wherever this is experienced<br>and this matched with how our<br>participants understood their own<br>experience<br>Sarah States there's not one thing in<br>particular I can say I've been saved<br>from because it's an ongoing thing with<br>me<br>there's a sense of growing and belief<br>and as a Christian<br>and Gary from the classic car Community<br>says I can't Proclaim to be a strong<br>Christian a strong believer but what<br>belief I have is more than what I had<br>just over four years ago<br>so understanding salvation as a process<br>is not something new for the Christian<br>faith and would be seen as a quite<br>normal a move away from a more<br>conversionist approach to the faith<br>the synthesis demonstrates the ways in<br>which these fresh Expressions have moved<br>from a Salvation primarily focused in<br>the future towards a focus on the<br>present<br>as North American Theologian Steve<br>Bevins and Roger Shredder right<br>salvation is something that is operative<br>now as we live in the presence of God's<br>grace and the spirit through Christ<br>again explicitly or implicitly<br>acknowledged and yet it's something<br>towards we which we continually move in<br>this life and into which we grow more<br>deeply<br>what pass and Schaefer go on to name<br>they say salvation first and foremost is<br>about becoming a person a more social<br>being<br>somebody who is capable of living in<br>loving relationships<br>and this was very clear in the<br>conversations we had that the change<br>which has come about as people have<br>participated in these communities has<br>been a growth and loving relationships<br>and through and alongside these growing<br>relationships they have experienced<br>growing closeness of to Jesus<br>the participants identify these<br>communities as unusual in a number of<br>ways<br>in the boxing Community they claimed<br>that it was more welcoming than any<br>boxing Community they had ever been to<br>before<br>they are not awkward and intimidating<br>but spaces where you're greeted with<br>handshakes and invited to participate<br>there are spaces where Faith<br>spirituality and God mix quite freely<br>with the activities they're doing the<br>relationships they are building and as a<br>result they seem to become places where<br>people are able to be more open perhaps<br>about family issues mental health<br>addiction or other things going on in<br>their lives<br>they are supportive communities<br>again these communities demonstrate<br>Parson Schaefer's description of how<br>these communities open up a<br>hermeneutical space in which we can<br>discover and explore God's salvation<br>they argue that it's a porous space<br>where people learn to explore their<br>nature as relational beings<br>their conclusion is that the theological<br>vision of God's mission is oriented<br>towards the restoration of community<br>both the sewing Collective and the<br>boxing Community expressed this in their<br>and the sewing Collective they say more<br>importantly it's the place of acceptance<br>and mutual support where women can share<br>and learn skills create community<br>Through telling our stories gain<br>self-worth and self-confidence<br>find self-expression through creativity<br>flourish and be transformed through<br>and and the boxing Community when you<br>spent an hour and a half kind of<br>sweating in the same room it's kind of<br>10 other people there's a kind of a kind<br>of leveling in that and there's a<br>realism of that and being able to to<br>kind of share and kind of the stories<br>we've got and kind of in our own lives<br>or kind of in the prayers all the time<br>our qualitative research has enabled us<br>to explore some of the ways in which<br>this communal soteriology is mediated<br>and enabled<br>so by rooting our account and the lived<br>practice of these communities we're<br>built on these insights looking at how<br>participation opens people up to<br>Salvation what that salvation looks like<br>in their lives how the holistic nature<br>of Salvation is expressed and explore<br>the significance for a communal<br>soteriology's turn to prayer<br>so it was fascinating to hear how people<br>were welcomed into these communities and<br>the enthusiasm for their communities<br>Gareth and the boxing Community told us<br>there's no other place that gives you<br>the support the friends and pretty much<br>it's like your own tight little family<br>and you look after each other it's<br>always been like that<br>Sarah from the sewing Collective<br>explained that it was part of her<br>extended family and Greg told us that<br>the classic car Community is exactly<br>what he had hoped for in a community<br>he said it's not just well-educated<br>people it's the full spectrum of what<br>you would call what you would hope would<br>be a community<br>so what exactly is it that underpins a<br>strong sense of Welcome community and<br>the extended family<br>and how is this part of a soterological<br>understanding and vision<br>so from listening to our participants<br>Express their enthusiasm for these<br>communities we think there are two main<br>Dimensions to this<br>one we have called chit chat or<br>conversation<br>and the other was about seeing the world<br>differently<br>so perhaps chit chat or conversation<br>sounds trivial and not very theological<br>and maybe even less so teriological<br>but is chit chat or conversation not at<br>the heart of what it means to be<br>together<br>and therefore to be human<br>at the heart of being human is living in<br>relationship with one another<br>being created in the image of God means<br>that we find our true identity in<br>coexistence with one another<br>our human existence is communal not<br>individualistic<br>so we are most human when we are living<br>and participating in community<br>not living and experiencing life as an<br>individual<br>we exercise and live out our freedom not<br>in Splendid isolation but in continual<br>interaction with other human beings<br>this implies being together<br>engaging in conversation or Chit Chat<br>listening to one another<br>sharing stories opening ourselves up in<br>mutuality and vulnerability<br>our participants certainly love telling<br>stories and engaging in conversation<br>Sarah confirmed Us in her experience of<br>the sewing Collective where she<br>explained<br>when we come together in the morning you<br>know we get the cattle on as you do when<br>you meet his friends and God and<br>whatever and we sit around for just a<br>general chit chat or how everybody is<br>if anybody's got any issues and so on<br>and so on and then we try to have a<br>little a little bit of time of quiet<br>time for prayer and reflection<br>Sam at the boxing Community really<br>reiterates this also<br>you walk in everybody shakes hands<br>everybody welcomes you you have a nice<br>chat a laugh before you even start<br>training you do your training and then<br>you're there for another 20 minutes to<br>half an hour at the end just having a<br>chat<br>conversation or Chit Chat seem to be at<br>the heart of their experience of<br>community<br>and it made me think again of the<br>African concept of Ubuntu which we<br>talked about yesterday<br>and I think that concept might help us<br>here<br>Ubuntu is a philosophy of life or moral<br>philosophy rooted in the South African<br>context and it's best expressed in<br>aphorisms and practices reflecting the<br>oral tradition from which it emerges<br>it describes the interconnectedness<br>or togetherness of all humans and that<br>it's only possible to be a person<br>through other persons I am because we<br>are<br>furthermore it describes Dynamic<br>interaction the active interplay of<br>forces between the individual and the<br>community and finally an Ubuntu ethic<br>refers to the importance of values of<br>generosity Hospitality friendliness<br>compassion and solidarity<br>and we certainly saw these values at<br>work in all three communities<br>Barry found solidarity in sharing his<br>stories and frustrations<br>he said it feels like to me anyway a<br>kind of safe space to share that stuff<br>it doesn't hurt that we have a few punch<br>bags that we can take our frustrations<br>out on when the need arises<br>Gary found compassion and comfort from<br>an older member of the classic car<br>Community he said who would just talk to<br>me and it won't be just about talking<br>about the cars we'll be talking about<br>our own restoration about how things are<br>going on between us<br>this level of sharing solidarity and<br>openness led to a depth of participation<br>and mutual support as they engaged with<br>one another's lives<br>the metaphor of restoration is very<br>important for the classic car community<br>the leader there is very attuned to the<br>culture and context of that Community as<br>he's a classic car Enthusiast himself<br>and he's able to be bilingual and uses a<br>metaphor of restoration to explain our<br>relationship with God he explains that<br>just as they lavish love and care on<br>restoring restoring their classic cars<br>so does God love lavish love and care<br>and restoring<br>his relationship with us or our<br>relationship with God and with one<br>another<br>it's a conversation and being together<br>seemed also to lead to increased<br>participation<br>the leaders we spoke with all had<br>stories of change when people became<br>part of these communities<br>they told us of people who grew in<br>confidence to such an extent by<br>participating in these communities<br>that they were on welcome teams and one<br>context in a prayer group and a gay bar<br>were involved in a youth project<br>participation in these groups meant<br>friendships sharing stories and openness<br>to sharing mental health issues and<br>finding support and acceptance<br>and we found it fascinating that two of<br>our groups could be seen as<br>stereotypically male Pursuits a boxing<br>community and a classic car community<br>and yet what these men loved about them<br>was the depth of sharing and<br>participation<br>for the classic car Community the<br>metaphor of car restoration was applied<br>to personal lives and to the loving<br>restoration of the whole person<br>and in the boxing Community it was about<br>being in each other's Corners they knew<br>that they had one another's backs<br>and what was most Delight perhaps most<br>delightful in a revealing Insight was<br>how their own participation enabled them<br>to see the world differently<br>our participants affirmed that the world<br>was a better place as a result of being<br>involved in these groups<br>Sarah said I think I can go in and be in<br>a really low in mood<br>and by the time I leave you know I'm in<br>a totally different place in my mental<br>capacity of how I'm dealing with things<br>that are going on at home or in my life<br>and Gary insisted several times that the<br>world is a better place as a result of<br>the classic car community and she felt<br>happier by participating in that<br>community<br>after a final prayer in the car park<br>Gary said last Saturday out on the car<br>park you know everybody was silent and<br>everybody listened and that's all you<br>ask for because those individuals can go<br>home and just hopefully as I did start<br>to feel that something might be better<br>in this world<br>surely this is a soteriological Insight<br>that there might be something better<br>while these communities might be<br>emphasizing a present Focus to Salvation<br>there are signs that it remains<br>eschatological<br>and perhaps the most telling<br>soteriological Insight came from Greg<br>who told us<br>I would say salvation is for whatever<br>better word where you are complete<br>and we thought this is indeed a<br>theological vision of God's Mission as<br>oriented towards the restoration of<br>community and seeing the world<br>differently<br>is all this salvation though as pass and<br>Schaefer pointedly ask<br>the point is of course<br>can this salvation be had without<br>actually confessing Jesus<br>even if it is unavailable without him<br>they ask of entering the sociological<br>space counts as conversion if one has<br>not confessed Jesus or believes in God<br>and this is a question and concern of<br>many Christians still<br>that perhaps in some ways it's the wrong<br>question or perhaps we're coming at this<br>from the wrong angle<br>back in the early 1990s over 30 years<br>ago South African messiologist David<br>Bosch was challenging us to have a more<br>comprehensive understanding of salvation<br>he wrote never before in history has<br>people's social distress been as<br>extensive as it is in the 20th century<br>and this may apply even more<br>particularly in our current decades and<br>our current context of a global pandemic<br>increased isolation and loneliness along<br>with soaring levels of mental health<br>issues and ongoing Wars<br>Bosch believes that Christians are well<br>placed to do something about these needs<br>he asserts to introduce change as<br>Christians and to all of this is to<br>mediate to is to mediate to Salvation<br>and he claims salvation is as coherent<br>Broad and deep as the needs and<br>exigencies of human existence<br>we certainly found this to be the<br>reality among our participants borne out<br>by our findings with respect to being in<br>community and how that improved their<br>well-being<br>however it did not stop with their own<br>personal well-being and this really<br>impressed and challenged us<br>nearly everyone we spoke to felt that<br>they had been changed as a person<br>through participating in these<br>communities and they wanted to pass this<br>on<br>we have called this fruits with its<br>biblical Resonance of lives transformed<br>which results in changed Behavior<br>Sarah explained it like this<br>I like to help other people<br>I would go out of my way to help<br>somebody if I see them people look to<br>you for a little bit of physical support<br>you know so that to be a Christian means<br>I've got to give something back give<br>something of myself<br>and she then went on to give a powerful<br>explanation of Hope which resonates with<br>Bosch's more comprehensive understanding<br>of salvation<br>she said hope for me is being able to<br>reach out to people who are less<br>fortunate than myself<br>because I've been saved from the sort of<br>squatted lives I might have had<br>previously my younger adolescence<br>being saved like that you've got to pass<br>on for hope<br>Gary from the classic car Community<br>expressed how his own personal<br>restoration has meant that he's able to<br>help others<br>he said well me personally this is<br>honestly the restoration of me has again<br>in turn helped the group because what<br>personally I hope is that I can possibly<br>help another person<br>and he related a very moving story of a<br>work colleague who told him that he<br>wanted to top himself and Gary replied<br>to this colleague that ain't the way<br>and then all of a sudden I started<br>trying to talk to him I told him about<br>my problems and my issues and he was<br>crying in front of me but at the end of<br>that he went I can't believe what you've<br>just done<br>I haven't done anything I've just told<br>you about me and you've told me about<br>you<br>and I said do you feel better<br>do I I do and from there on he's been a<br>friend<br>but if it wasn't for this community<br>things like that in my life so you can<br>see how it's made a difference<br>and by being a part of the sewing<br>Collective Sarah grew in self-confidence<br>she was able to help others and she'd<br>found hope that she wanted to share for<br>Gary being part of the classic part of<br>the classic car Community has helped him<br>likewise to grow in confidence and to be<br>able to share about his own restored<br>life<br>so that he could help others and<br>literally save a life<br>Gary passionately believes that the<br>classic car communities make the world a<br>better place<br>he said there's more communities<br>starting to go around the country and if<br>it can be hosted by people that help to<br>run and build then the world is going to<br>be just that little bit of a better<br>place to be in<br>so those stories do indeed seem to meet<br>Bosch's Criterion of Salvation meeting<br>the needs and exigencies of human<br>existence<br>so these are examples of the<br>transformation leading to changed<br>attitudes and actions but there was also<br>inner and personal transformations<br>Sam and Gareth and the boxing Community<br>expressed the inner transformation as a<br>kind of inner peace and an inner<br>confidence<br>Sam said<br>for me<br>that's what it was just you just feel<br>like you're a better person you're<br>you're kinder to others you don't you're<br>not I can't put it into words like<br>you're not uptight with situations<br>you're more relaxed and you actually<br>listen to people rather than just<br>sticking to your own opinion<br>Gareth reflected I used to be really<br>hot-headed everything used to be around<br>no matter who it's with or what it's<br>about and in coming here it's chilled me<br>out<br>Gary from the classic car Community said<br>something similar and that<br>he used to be really Brash and more<br>self-centered person and that this<br>change has enabled him to help others<br>and to be less self-centered<br>perhaps mark from the boxing Community<br>sums it up<br>you know me just try to be the best<br>person you can be<br>none of us are perfect you're never<br>going to be the best person all the time<br>but it allows you are a bit more<br>breathing space so you can think about<br>things more and try to be you know more<br>level-headed about things and then also<br>be more Christian about it as well<br>we thought that on reflection that was<br>quite a doctrinal statement<br>we see Illusions in there to Grace<br>to forgiveness and Redemption to<br>compassion to sanctification and<br>discipleship<br>he also alludes to issues of<br>vulnerability self-worth and an honest<br>and realistic assessment of The Human<br>Condition<br>how can this not be salvation<br>salesian priest and theologian from<br>India father Sebastian Curry temporal<br>expresses Mark's ideas similarly<br>he says salvation consists and the<br>gradual transformation of the inner<br>person into the image and likeness of<br>the creator<br>to an authentic Humanity<br>this is a gradual and lifelong process<br>here is the ground for the unity of the<br>human vocation<br>so this account of the fruits of<br>Salvation further demonstrates the ways<br>in which a communal salvation is<br>experienced is Meaningful and brings<br>about change<br>but there is still a need to tackle the<br>question about the place of confession<br>and articulation of faith<br>theologians may be happy to name this as<br>Christ's work experienced implicitly<br>but as we continue to reflect on these<br>communities there was a niggling<br>question of whether much of this was the<br>language of a contemporary well-being<br>culture rather than an explicitly<br>Christian one<br>after all the language that many of the<br>participants pertaining to was about<br>having a better and more Balanced Life<br>healthy routines personal health being a<br>better person and being more generous<br>these are not exclusive to Christianity<br>and more generally be seen as good<br>throughout contemporary British culture<br>it could also be argued that these<br>qualities do not easily map on to<br>Christianity throughout history<br>after all it would be difficult to argue<br>that the Desert Mothers and Fathers<br>prioritized a balanced life or personal<br>health in the way it's articulated here<br>so one clear Trend in the data which is<br>culturally rooted is a strong emphasis<br>on authenticity being real with each<br>other<br>this subject of turn in religion is a<br>fascinating subject but the key Point<br>here is not so much<br>it's not so much how religious<br>participation and late modernity is a<br>culturally rooted phenomenon but to ask<br>about the implications of this<br>subjective language for a communal<br>soteriology<br>interestingly the leaders of some of<br>these fresh Expressions were cautious<br>about letting us talk to their<br>communities about salvation<br>because it was not language they had<br>used<br>and they thought that it might be<br>alienating<br>so on one level this is good and right<br>that they should care for those they<br>work with in a pastoral role but perhaps<br>it also revealed what pass and Schaefer<br>describe as a theological embarrassment<br>about salvation<br>Paul who set up and leads the boxing<br>Community talked about his regret at<br>using the word conversion in some<br>previous publicity about the community<br>and turned instead to a language of<br>Journey and process<br>adding value bringing peace offering<br>words of comfort<br>rather than conversion he began to see<br>the Divine and other people<br>Wendy reflecting on the forest church<br>group which she helps to lead identified<br>that these changes she said that these<br>changes identified above are not<br>articulated in Christian terms within<br>that community<br>and she states<br>the one criticism I think I would have<br>about this project or this community is<br>that I mean the families call it church<br>and we open the prayer and its gentle<br>Witness<br>but there's nobody really identifying<br>that there's nobody including me making<br>these links between transformation and<br>Jesus you know or pointing out where the<br>holy spirit is moving<br>Wendy can see changes and identify them<br>as because of God but the group is not<br>comfortable to name that for others<br>in response Anna a curate involved in<br>similar work in another part of the<br>country asked whether they could pose<br>questions which would encourage people<br>to name the change themselves<br>this seems to fit with a monsie O'Day<br>approach of fresh Expressions<br>identifying the spirit's work through<br>listening reflection and discernment but<br>in not wanting to impose an<br>interpretation it may actually be<br>denying them the language to express it<br>and lacking this language it might not<br>be surprising that they would turn to<br>the more familiar language of well-being<br>for example Sarah resists salvation<br>language<br>I want to be that close to Jesus and<br>prayer in my life that I you know I<br>don't feel like I need saving but I'm<br>just one of those people that you know<br>he's looking out for really<br>she reframes it as looking out for<br>looking out for each other<br>similarly Sam when trying to express<br>what he means about being a better<br>person says I can't put it into words<br>but talks about being relaxed and<br>listening to others<br>so this shows that while articulation is<br>not required for salvation<br>articulation of Faith does have a role<br>to play<br>Markham Macintosh an Episcopal priest<br>and theologian might be off to help us<br>here he focused on seeing Theology and<br>spirituality as integrated through the<br>mystics<br>he describes spirituality as the<br>impression of the encounter with God on<br>the community<br>and theology as the expression of that<br>encounter<br>and he describes the separation of<br>spirituality and theology as<br>debilitating and how both ideally serve<br>each other<br>theology needs to be rooted in the<br>experience of the community but<br>spirituality similarly needs theology to<br>move experience from some private<br>devotional or personal encounter to<br>become meaningful for the community<br>he notes the problem with the separation<br>from theology is that it tends to<br>disorientate spirituality<br>to deprive it of some stable communal<br>goal and reference and hence render it's<br>susceptible to the idle compulsions or<br>fears of the individual<br>the communities in this research might<br>be nervous about imposing meaning on<br>experience that Macintosh highlights<br>that without the language to enabled<br>articulation the community is undermined<br>reverting to individual experience<br>subject to the individual's own virtues<br>and vice virtues and vices rather than<br>being drawn into the bigger story of<br>Christian tradition<br>confession of Faith might be unnecessary<br>for salvation but an ability to<br>articulate the communal experience<br>becomes necessary for maintaining and<br>the turn to prayer it was surprising to<br>us<br>and I'm not exactly sure why but it was<br>surprising to us to find just how<br>important prayer was to the participants<br>for Sam prayer at the end of the boxing<br>sessions resonated with him<br>Gareth was intrigued and drawn in by<br>prayer and how the prayers in the boxing<br>club related to their lives in contrast<br>to standard church-going prayers was key<br>for Ben<br>Gary looked forward to the prayer at the<br>end of the classic car meetings and<br>actually started offering to pray for<br>others at work and for Sarah prayer was<br>associated with being close to Jesus she<br>prays daily<br>North American Theologian Andrew root<br>suggests that the turn to the imminent<br>to resources and programs<br>has been the key problem for churches<br>and means that Divine action is pushed<br>into the background<br>He suggests teaching people to pray is<br>one of the key roles of the pastor<br>bringing Divine Focus bring the focus<br>back to Divine action<br>he States in prayer we come to see that<br>God that this God is a minister who<br>shares in our lives by caring for us<br>the way in which prayer has been valued<br>and taken up<br>by those in these communities is<br>absolutely fascinating and as a clear<br>example that what is going on is beyond<br>our simply well-being emphasis<br>English Theologian Ashley coxsworth and<br>her Systematic Theology of prayer<br>explores avagrius's assertion that<br>prayer is the mind's conversation with<br>god<br>which cocksworth asserts that suggests<br>at the center of all existence is deep<br>dialogue with the divine<br>and while rooting that conversation<br>while noting that conversation is a<br>metaphor picked up again and again in<br>the Christian tradition prayer can't be<br>said to Matt nicely onto human<br>conversation<br>rather than a neat back and forth It's<br>instead a messy polyphony of voices<br>intersecting with each other<br>but given that those prayers are both<br>given by Christ and that Christ to<br>praise in the person praying he asserts<br>that to pray truly is to be caught up in<br>the sun's Eternal conversation with the<br>father<br>this articulation of prayer further<br>serves our thesis of a communal<br>salvation as prayer becomes the way in<br>which the relationships of welcome and<br>participation are valued and drawn into<br>communion<br>so what we are seeing in the practice of<br>these communities is a holistic<br>understanding of life and therefore<br>salvation<br>salvation is not compartmentalized into<br>moments actions or practices but is<br>integrated right throughout the life of<br>the community<br>experienced by the individuals and their<br>relationships with one another<br>prayer is one way in which the community<br>opens these relationships up to<br>encounter Jesus<br>Malawi and messiologist Harvey quiani<br>critiques Western approaches to<br>evangelism asking why so much time is<br>spent on strategy and so little time on<br>prayer<br>what we see from these groups is that<br>prayer does not simply prepare the way<br>but is a key means of participation<br>the significance of prayer for the<br>participants<br>suggests that it is at the heart of what<br>it means to be a fresh expression and at<br>the heart of a communal soteriology<br>so to conclude who then can be saved<br>just as the Rich Young ruler's<br>assumptions behind his question were<br>challenged perhaps we too need to think<br>about this question differently<br>our aim has been to explore a lived<br>soteriology for fresh Expressions<br>through praying close attention to the<br>experience of members of fresh<br>expressions<br>hopefully we've demonstrated the ways in<br>which the accounts reveal a communal<br>soteriology<br>this soteriology is mediated through<br>participation and conversation and bears<br>fruit and changed lives perspectives<br>relationships and actions<br>we suggested that bringing this<br>experience of soteriology to<br>articulation is important for the<br>communal sharing of this experience<br>not because people need to know or<br>confess things to be saved but because<br>the communal soteriology itself is<br>served by such an articulation<br>and we've shown how the emphasis on<br>prayer is integral to this communal<br>satriology helping to give it a<br>Transcendent and eschatological<br>perspective<br>and we believe that by articulating a<br>lived communal soteriology this then<br>offers a fresh fresh perspective on the<br>ecclesiology of fresh expressions<br>pass and Schaefer suggest that community<br>building and discipleship are two sides<br>of the same soteriological coin<br>and we might tentatively assert that the<br>communities in this research are<br>becoming places where they meet Christ<br>through meeting together and that they<br>are changed through these encounters<br>through these communities and their<br>practices<br>the encounter with Christ is mediated in<br>the relationships with one another and<br>the relationships with one another are<br>enriched and deepened because of their<br>Temptation when turning to an<br>ecclesiology of fresh Expressions is to<br>see what needs to be added to make this<br>church<br>be the sacraments the preaching of the<br>word or through developing the four<br>marks of the church<br>but in these communities we have seen<br>these things emerging through the<br>encounters with one another<br>the participants did not hesitate to<br>call these communities their church<br>because of these meaningful encounters<br>eating together becomes the breaking of<br>bread together<br>baptism<br>becomes the natural expression of<br>finding this better version of oneself<br>and having encountered Jesus<br>the word is shared because questions are<br>asked and stories are explored<br>these communities are experienced as<br>graced as sacramental<br>to think that somehow it becomes Church<br>by adding something to it is to miss the<br>work of the spirit and their midst<br>for us the biggest question is how the<br>articulation of a communal soteriology<br>can happen not that just at the level of<br>an academic paper or presentation but<br>Within These communities<br>we want to see a communal soteriology<br>that enables these things to become<br>further shared with one another and with<br>those who find themselves welcomed and<br>drawn into these relationships these<br>communities of salvation<br>thank you for listening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
