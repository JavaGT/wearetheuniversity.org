of this series is<br>Mission as an adventure of the<br>imagination and tonight Kathy will be<br>presenting on Mission and whiteness for<br>those of you who don't know Kathy I'm<br>just a very very very brief<br>um<br>bio she works with this church<br>missionary Society in Oxford and is also<br>lecture and Mission at Regents Park<br>College Oxford<br>and it is my great Delight to welcome<br>good evening everybody thank you for<br>your warm welcome as Chris said<br>tonight's lecture is on Mission and<br>whiteness<br>a fellowship of the unlike and um<br>you're going to start by doing a bit of<br>drawing actually so those of you who are<br>online you will need pen and paper<br>and I'm going to give you a few minutes<br>to do this exercise it's only for you<br>you don't have to show it to anybody or<br>talk to anyone about it so relax it's<br>just for you you can cover your paper if<br>you need to and but we will come back to<br>it briefly at the end again just for you<br>to look at<br>so to start off could you take your<br>piece of paper and draw<br>five actually I couldn't get an image of<br>five but five concentric circles so it<br>looks like that four or five<br>for those of you at home this is what<br>you'll need to do pen and paper and four<br>or five concentric circles please<br>and then I'll tell you what<br>they'll need to be big enough to write<br>and we'll just do it quite quickly and<br>briefly don't overthink it otherwise<br>so have you done your five circles<br>so in the first Circle<br>write one word that best describes you<br>one word<br>and then in the second Circle write two<br>more two more words that best describe<br>and then in the third circle write three<br>more<br>and you've probably got the drill by now<br>and if you have enough words left in the<br>fifth Circle right<br>up to five more<br>and this is not to show anyone it's only<br>I'll give you one more minute<br>okay if you haven't finished don't worry<br>I asked you to do this exercise because<br>I think it's revealing<br>and it shows us something of our own<br>context our own complexities and perhaps<br>our own unfinished agendas<br>for example I wonder how many of you put<br>woman or man in the inner circles<br>or white or black<br>or able-bodied or differently abled or<br>heterosexual or gay<br>so I borrowed this exercise from British<br>afro-caribbean Theologian Anthony Reddy<br>who's used it many times I've used it a<br>few times<br>and we have both noticed that minority<br>groups or groups who experience<br>marginalization or othering or even<br>invisibility<br>usually do name that in one of their<br>inner circles while those who are<br>normalized do not<br>so recently I used this with a group of<br>students<br>and not a single male student noted that<br>he was a man in any Circle<br>whereas all the women did<br>Anthony has noticed the same with those<br>other realities I mentioned if you're<br>able-bodied you probably neither notice<br>nor note that down but if you're<br>differently abled you might or if you're<br>white you probably don't notice that or<br>write it down but if you black you may<br>do and so on<br>so I think that this exercise points to<br>not only our own inner complexities<br>our own personal realities and<br>located-ness or context the reality of<br>our own Human Condition but also it can<br>alert us to the systemic and structural<br>injustices in which we are embedded and<br>enmeshed such as being a woman in a<br>patriarchal world or being a black<br>person in a world of white privilege or<br>being gay in a cisgendered world and so<br>on<br>these unjust systems and structures can<br>make it hard for us to notice<br>or to be attentive or to see clearly<br>indeed systems and structures want to<br>Blind us or to make us indifferent to<br>Injustice in its many forms economic<br>racial sexual class Etc<br>for example we might not notice that if<br>we're white we benefit from centuries of<br>white privilege or if we're male we<br>benefit from being the norm the default<br>setting or if they're able-bodied we<br>just don't even think about how we're<br>going to navigate the world<br>or if we're straight what that might<br>mean for our gay friends to be in church<br>which seems to be the least loving and<br>accepting Place sometimes<br>or refriminal class just how patronizing<br>and unaware we can come across<br>so maybe it's easy to blame systems and<br>structures<br>principalities and Powers we blightly<br>say and Nod wisely I have done this<br>myself<br>and I agree that there are<br>principalities and Powers at work and<br>that sometimes this seems to be a kind<br>of evil Unleashed that is humanly<br>incomprehensible<br>and seems to take over think of the<br>Holocaust the Rwandan Genocide the<br>troubles in Northern Ireland the Russian<br>invasion of Ukraine what's going on in<br>Sudan at the moment<br>perhaps those are extreme examples<br>though so then let's think in a UK<br>context with which I'm more familiar but<br>I imagine it's similar here<br>let's think of the year's Asylum Seekers<br>can spend waiting in the system for<br>their case to be heard<br>or the month and months and years it can<br>take for people in the welfare system to<br>get the benefits they're entitled to<br>to the unequal access to the education<br>system the postcode lottery for the<br>Health Care system in Britain<br>the lack of representation of women and<br>people in color in leadership in any<br>Institution<br>but who are these systems and<br>institutions<br>who are they<br>well to a large extent they're us aren't<br>they these systems and institutions we<br>are involved and we perpetuate the evil<br>the violent free Injustice and the<br>indifference we are part of these<br>systems and structures and institutions<br>that allow such injustices to be<br>perpetuated<br>so like many of you I began to see this<br>in Stark relief during the pandemic<br>we all know how the pandemic has opened<br>up the cracks and exposed the<br>inequalities and injustices that were<br>already there<br>it has forced us to face those these<br>inequalities and injustices in our world<br>then justices and inequalities of our<br>systems and in our lives and I think<br>it's been a wake-up call<br>and it was a wake-up call for me<br>particularly in one area that of racial<br>Justice and I would like to explore this<br>with you now<br>so in some ways I've been thinking about<br>issues of race all my life<br>I am from here I'm from arteroa New<br>Zealand I was born here I was brought up<br>in Auckland<br>I think it's called now is that right<br>um so I was brought up in aotearo New<br>Zealand where 15 of our population is<br>Maori<br>as a child so I'm older than most of you<br>but as a child at primary school I can<br>remember learning stick games and POI<br>dances<br>as if these were rituals of some exotic<br>culture<br>some other culture and tribe<br>while the memorial children in the<br>classroom sitting next to me I mean<br>looking back it seems othering and quite<br>frankly bizarre<br>we know that we park here uh the<br>maruhiri the incomers the guests are the<br>tangitofeno are the people of the land<br>and I do think that despite that growing<br>up here in aotearoa New Zealand<br>the Maori world view has had an impact<br>on how I see myself in relation to land<br>indigenous cultures and other people it<br>has shaped who I am and our culture and<br>aotearoa New Zealand and then more<br>recently the emergence of black lives<br>matters also raised my awareness even<br>further and so I started reading<br>intentionally around race books blogs<br>and podcasts and I'm going to show you<br>some of the books I read I hope this<br>doesn't look too show offy but this is<br>in the last few years not just in the<br>last few months so these are books that<br>have a very British Focus but or North<br>American Focus but a focus around race<br>and these are some of the books that I<br>read<br>and one area that had a particularly had<br>a huge impact on me was the slave trade<br>so of course I knew about the slave<br>trade and its Horrors<br>but actually it was only after reading<br>that book British in the middle yet<br>there the yellow one but after her she's<br>a Ghanaian Brit in 2018 I read that book<br>that I started to think<br>what does it do to you to know that your<br>ancestors were slaves<br>actually that book was such a great book<br>I gave it to our kids for Christmas<br>and insisted that they read it<br>if you are black and British you also<br>suffer a kind of Double Jeopardy because<br>it was only in 2015.<br>2015<br>that<br>our taxes in Britain<br>stopped paying off the compensation<br>offered to slave owners in the 19th<br>century<br>in 2015. did you know that<br>I didn't know that I thought how is this<br>even possible how have I not known this<br>in 2015 our taxes stopped paying off the<br>compensation to the slave owners<br>not the slaves who've got nothing<br>I thought well it's okay I'm a kiwi I'm<br>not part of this this is the Brits<br>problem<br>British Empire<br>but then I thought<br>our own New Zealand was part of the<br>British Empire<br>and some of our wealth and development<br>will be a direct result of the slave<br>trade<br>and certainly Maori suffered under<br>colonialism now that might be a bit of a<br>segue from slave trade to colonialism<br>but I think there are some connections<br>much of the land was taken the language<br>was banned for a period in the 1930s<br>their customs and culture othered and<br>exoticized it was the first CMS<br>missionaries who transliterated the<br>language and introduced the printing<br>press so made Publications in Maori<br>possible there's also the Anglican<br>Church led by Bishop so on at the time<br>who refused to ordain Maori clergy until<br>they could speak Greek and Hebrew but<br>you will know more about this than me<br>and then two further encounters<br>challenged me in this area of racial<br>justice during this covert period one<br>was reading after whiteness by William<br>James Jennings and other works by<br>African-American by other works by him<br>and the other was the daily meetups with<br>our neighbors during the various<br>lockdowns I've forgotten how many<br>lockdowns we had in Britain now but I<br>think it was at least three and the<br>first one was for three months and it<br>was very strict<br>so I'm going to start with neighbors and<br>so that was the first encounter that<br>confronted me<br>being forced to stay at home so we had<br>to be at home we had to stay at home we<br>were allowed out once a day for a walk<br>and um that was it<br>so being forced to stay at home and to<br>stay local challenged me in unexpected<br>ways<br>as you could only meet up one to one or<br>in very small groups we slightly stretch<br>the definition with our neighbors but<br>so this smallness meant that we<br>experienced life and the level of<br>intimacy that we did not know before so<br>during that first lockdown with a group<br>of neighbors I live in a kind of it's a<br>typical sort of British housing estate<br>and our houses are all pretty close to<br>each other but there's a big open sort<br>of driveway area in front of all the<br>houses so during the first lockdown<br>I met with my neighbors every day at two<br>o'clock<br>so every day at two o'clock whoever<br>wanted to I mean everyone was home<br>because there was nowhere else to go<br>whoever wanted to came outside and we<br>met together for a cup of tea my son<br>said to me what did you talk about every<br>day<br>but we managed to find things to talk<br>about we shared much of life together we<br>were vulnerable tearful open honest and<br>hospitable even with many restrictions<br>we shared our struggles and joys<br>together we offered and received<br>Hospitality comfort and support<br>we know the hospitality is a good<br>metaphor for Mission I've already talked<br>about that with its ambiguity and<br>fluidity of Hosting guests challenging<br>many of our understandings of<br>reciprocity power and gift<br>I discovered that I needed my neighbors<br>I needed their human companionship as my<br>husband was working long hours at the<br>medical center most days he was still<br>going to work as a medical doctor I<br>discovered sharing mutuality the<br>enriching of community because we'd been<br>pushed into a place of seeing our need<br>of the other and the incompleteness of<br>Our Own self-sufficiency<br>it felt like we were learning what it<br>meant to be human together<br>and these seem to be key principles and<br>Mission<br>he wondered why was it ever like this<br>before the pandemic<br>well I guess there are some obvious<br>reasons I was traveling to work I was<br>shadowing around the world I actually<br>never took much effort to get to know my<br>neighbors<br>I was polite but distant I was too busy<br>to get involved<br>and until now I've never really thought<br>very attentively about Jesus's second<br>commandment<br>does he literally mean love your<br>neighbor as in the person next door<br>probably yes<br>certainly in his context and in his day<br>so this might be my first challenge the<br>missionary Frontier as former CMS<br>General Secretary Bishop John Taylor<br>rather quaintly put it is literally five<br>steps away<br>the number of steps to my nearest<br>neighbor's front door<br>and neighbors are always there in fact<br>you may see your neighbors more than<br>your own extended family neighbors can<br>interrupt you they can demand things<br>from you you actually can't avoid them<br>unless you choose to<br>and this encounter with my neighbors<br>challenged me because of our own<br>diversity<br>as a group of neighbors we represented<br>other ethnicities and nationalities as<br>well as other faiths or none<br>so diversity has many faces cultural<br>racial ethnic gender sexuality<br>differently abled age class to name some<br>in the pandemic unmasked and revealed<br>starkly these diversities<br>and precisely because of our diversity<br>and the racism one of our number<br>experienced black lives matter and<br>racism became a key area for discussion<br>recent Publications have also alerted us<br>yet again to our lack of awareness with<br>respect to racial diversity our<br>institutional racism and our white<br>fragility<br>and so I had some very uncomfortable<br>conversations with our neighbors during<br>our daily meetups<br>and then towards the end of the first<br>lockdown I read after whiteness by<br>African-American Theologian Willie James<br>Jennings<br>I read this as part of a dth reading<br>group with the University of Roehampton<br>and afterwards I devoured a lot of other<br>stuff by home articles lectures podcast<br>webinars<br>and he used a metaphor which became a<br>kind of light bulb moment for me in<br>seeing the world<br>possession control and Mastery as his<br>metaphor<br>and suddenly the world and how we have<br>engaged in it made a lot of sense to me<br>so let me try to explain this to you<br>so in his book after whiteness Jennings<br>claims that the role of theological<br>education in particular is to cultivate<br>belonging<br>but he explains that theological<br>education has become instead an exercise<br>and mastery<br>and it's a plantation metaphor so<br>literally he says it was the master<br>training the master's son to run the<br>plantation efficiently to maintain order<br>to categorize to delimit Define maximize<br>the efficient use of slaves bodies<br>however he offers some Hope by stating<br>that theological education has within it<br>the resources to reframe Western<br>education Beyond this distortion<br>the first is so he uses this image<br>according to Jennings there are two<br>things that form this distortion<br>and the first one is this<br>a white self-sufficient man has<br>self-sufficiency defined by possession<br>controller mastery<br>the second is that many respond to this<br>image by promoting a homogeneity that<br>aims towards a cultural nationalism<br>this then results in hegemony and<br>homogeneity power or authority and<br>sameness neither of which are gospel<br>values and can can lead us towards an<br>individualized faith and a utilitarian<br>education and away from diversity<br>furthermore Jennings explains and this<br>is important that white self-sufficient<br>masculinity which is the phrase he uses<br>does not necessarily refer to a<br>particular person<br>but rather it's the way of organizing<br>life that distorts their identity and<br>the possibility of a richer life<br>together<br>and moreover whiteness does not even<br>necessarily refer to skin color<br>but rather to a way of being in or<br>operating in the world<br>a way of seeing the world and inhabiting<br>the world<br>therefore when theological education<br>becomes an exercise and possession<br>control and Mastery it sets out to<br>maintain order to categorize the limit<br>to phone maximize efficiency and<br>productivity<br>maybe this sounds a little bit like the<br>University full stop<br>Mission has played its part in this as<br>it has so often been framed by or<br>located in white colonialism<br>as this was how Colonial Masters saw the<br>world<br>we might call this the pedagogy of<br>Plantation and I think we can see how<br>this is influenced not only our<br>engagement and Mission<br>not only our engagement Mission but also<br>our language<br>much of Western mission<br>and perhaps even Church growth<br>reflects this in its drive for growth<br>expansion efficiency measurement<br>projects strategies and numbers<br>there are targets to meet business plans<br>and projects to write strategies to<br>formulate conversions to count ever<br>bigger and more expensive conferences to<br>attend<br>much of this language and world view<br>comes from the worlds of military and<br>management worlds of War measurement<br>efficiency productivity and Victory<br>in fact there's even a term for this<br>managerial missiology<br>a cold reductionist term which<br>dehumanizes mission<br>and 20 years ago Peruvian mythologist<br>Samuel Escobar critiqued this back in<br>2003<br>he wrote what I am seeing in the<br>application of these Concepts in mission<br>is that missionaries depersonalize<br>people into unreached targets making<br>them objects of Hit and Run efforts to<br>get decisions that may be reported<br>Jennings explains how colonialism meant<br>that whiteness was projected onto the<br>world<br>European Christians and missionaries<br>projected<br>a meaning onto the world that was very<br>different from many of the cultures they<br>went to and were living in<br>they challenge the world view shared by<br>many indigenous peoples about their<br>sense of identity their sense of<br>well-being and relationship with the<br>land creation and the place and even the<br>indigenous languages<br>these early Europeans and new places<br>defined they designated they divided<br>ancient tribal groupings<br>Rwanda and Burundi is a classic example<br>of that they created borders with<br>straight lines have a look at the<br>borders around Sudan and Algeria<br>they developed racial categories<br>they challenged and destroyed the deeply<br>held beliefs and practices of indigenous<br>peoples<br>for indigenous peoples the places in<br>them the place the land they are the<br>place the land the creation we know this<br>from Maori culture here and aotearoa New<br>Zealand we know this here with the Maori<br>Define themselves according to their<br>place their Mountain their River will<br>see in their tribe and the Maori word<br>for land fenua is the same word for<br>placenta<br>Maori is the land the land is them<br>Ori understanding of the land contrast<br>for the European worldview of individual<br>ownership<br>and one which has so often reduced to<br>the land to an inert or utilitarian<br>resource for our own use<br>this seems to be an extraction or<br>economic worldview whereas many<br>indigenous cultures practice the world<br>view with a more of a gift mentality<br>Maori Theologian J matanga writes that<br>the Maori world view is of a sharing and<br>gift economy<br>but that when industrialization was<br>imposed it was out of sync with our<br>souls and like most indigenous peoples<br>around the world it proved a fast track<br>to poverty<br>so this Plantation metaphor plays out in<br>many ways<br>in the United States educational<br>institutions many of them are literally<br>built on former Plantation land or with<br>endowments from slavery<br>we know that the same is true in Britain<br>also<br>in Oxford some post-grad students have<br>started what they call the uncomfortable<br>Oxford tour uncomfortable Oxford founded<br>in 2018<br>by some post-grad students with the aim<br>of raising questions about the<br>uncomfortable legacies of inequality and<br>imperialism in the city and in the<br>University<br>they say we ultimately ask how can we<br>engage collectively with these histories<br>in the public space<br>the uncomfortable Oxford walking tour is<br>an excellent way of learning about<br>Oxford's uncomfortable history including<br>its links with the slave trade so if you<br>ever visit Oxford I highly recommend<br>these tours they've got the classic one<br>the uncomfortable Oxford tour they also<br>have one on money they have one on<br>Empire and you can do them online so if<br>you never get to Oxford you can sign up<br>and do them online they cost about<br>so it's an excellent way of learning<br>about Empire and some of this<br>uncomfortable history one of the stops<br>of the uncomfortable<br>walking tour is All Souls college and<br>there's a picture of it the doorway<br>there<br>where its connection to wealth generated<br>from slave plantations in the Caribbean<br>as explained<br>the college's codrington library is<br>named after a plantation owner<br>and the online tour shows a photo of a<br>young black man outside the college with<br>the word the words all slaves College<br>painted on his body<br>to address this Legacy the college<br>recently created an annual scholarship<br>two I think for undergrad students from<br>the Caribbean they also mounted a plaque<br>inside the Library<br>so it's through that door I don't think<br>you can see the plaque but it says in<br>memory of those who worked in slavery on<br>the codgington plantation in the West<br>Indies<br>unfortunately the plaque is not visible<br>to most people because that door is<br>normally closed it's not open to the<br>public<br>this Plantation metaphor is more than<br>just an economic worldview it relates to<br>how we organize the world how we inhabit<br>our world a world of efficiency control<br>measurement and production for the sake<br>of the master and the Masters sense<br>Jennings claims as replicated in places<br>far removed from the history of the<br>slave holding USA because we have all<br>been framed in this way<br>he says an ecclesial reality inside a<br>white patriarchal Domesticity<br>shaped by an overwhelming white presence<br>that always aims to build a national and<br>the slave Legacy of theological<br>education is deeply embedded in our<br>imagination our imaginations and in many<br>of our institutions<br>it might be harder for you to understand<br>here in artero New Zealand but believe<br>me we can see it in Britain and if we<br>think it's just if this is Extreme or<br>just a North American problem think<br>again<br>we have seen how it's easy to think how<br>this might apply to Oxbridge Oxford and<br>Cambridge or to theological tradition<br>colleges for their traditions of Empire<br>embedded in their architecture their<br>three could say we could take this a bit<br>more broadly and think well what about<br>us<br>and some of our missional instincts and<br>practices<br>and if we think especially within the<br>context of emerging church or fresh<br>Expressions which I spoke about last<br>week<br>let's just pause for a moment and ask<br>ourselves a few uncomfortable questions<br>emerging from this analysis<br>and you'll have to think of resonances<br>for you here in arteroa New Zealand I'm<br>thinking about this more in a British<br>context but I'm sure there'll be some<br>overlaps<br>so are we very white and middle class<br>do we sometimes have a kind of Savior<br>complex with our activist approaches and<br>our entrepreneurial mindsets<br>how diverse are our communities<br>how different from us are our<br>communities and who has given leadership<br>in our contexts<br>who is invisible<br>whose voices are not heard and who is<br>not present at the table<br>sometimes even in a strong example of an<br>emerging church or fresh Expressions<br>there are still issues<br>I can think of one community in England<br>where a member told me that he longed<br>for the leader to be more open and more<br>vulnerable<br>this person would have loved to be able<br>to help the leader<br>and when thinking about context good<br>coffee and craft beers May appeal to<br>certain groups but we know that's only<br>one sector of society<br>maybe it's more about<br>or you'll have to think of what the<br>equivalent is here<br>what might be the Kiwi equivalent<br>do we hang out with the like-minded and<br>sweep people along with us with our own<br>ideas of a future that we should all<br>inhabit as Jennings refers to<br>in my own ecclesial context of the<br>Church of England black British Anglican<br>priest Azariah France Williams offers a<br>searing critique of institutional racism<br>in the Church of England<br>his book is a kind of theology From<br>Below prophetic storytelling poetic full<br>of stories metaphor anecdote and<br>Imagination I thought perhaps our<br>Theology and mythology could look a bit<br>more like that<br>he offers some imaginative re-readings<br>of biblical texts using the lens of<br>black theology<br>and he also imagines some new ways<br>forward He suggests a truth and<br>reparations commission which could be a<br>sharing of stories followed by<br>recompense and maybe a relationship<br>but he also wonders if that would be<br>enough<br>what would that relationship be based on<br>he concludes rather bleakly that the<br>Church of England or the cross and Crown<br>Club as he calls it<br>was not designed for people of color<br>he says if you're ignored for long<br>enough<br>the social death<br>the isolation<br>and the futility of your efforts for<br>change silence you and sentence you to a<br>things are changing<br>and with the Advent of movements such as<br>black lives matter roads must fall or<br>that was a particularly Oxford thing<br>Cecil Rhodes as a an Oxford there's a<br>roads scholarships I guess you know<br>about this<br>roads must fall except he hasn't his<br>statues still there in the High Street<br>uh me too Extinction Rebellion the<br>momentum around decolonizing the<br>curriculum the discussion about private<br>property and public statues in England<br>that was brought to a head with the<br>former slave trader Edward Colston being<br>unceremoniously dumped in Bristol Harbor<br>but I note this is a live issue here too<br>I read in stuff<br>stuff.co.nz<br>that academic resource I read on stuff<br>about the sordid history behind the<br>Wakefield Memorial and the

that took us out of the<br>picture<br>fans are divided over this some wonder<br>what the memorial even is some find the<br>actual structure beautiful<br>former white fern Penny canzela thinks<br>she thinks it represents oppression and<br>Colonial attitudes<br>Heritage New Zealand Kerry Pollock said<br>interpretation is really important<br>Heritage listings represent a moment in<br>time<br>but social attitudes towards something<br>might change changing social narratives<br>so there are no easy answers as to how<br>we deal with our history and interpret<br>it but we need to have these<br>conversations<br>slowly becoming aware how white<br>privilege and even white supremacy have<br>skewed and distorted theological<br>education and our engagement and mission<br>for so long<br>my colleague malawian mythologist Harvey<br>quiani claims<br>many white Christians Jesus do not know<br>how to relate with black and browned<br>people apart from oppressing them<br>600 years of church history can testify<br>he maintains that mission as we<br>understand and practice it today is a<br>European creation and that we need to<br>learn to engage in Mission without an<br>attitude of superiority<br>one of our students challenged us<br>recently<br>the interesting thing to me then is just<br>how much this module of theology is a<br>Global Perspective is making me question<br>everything<br>one of the questions I have repeatedly<br>asked in the sessions is why amazing<br>people continue towards improving an<br>institution so clearly steeped in<br>colonialism patriarchy and a whole<br>manner of other issues when they could<br>create something new a concrete a<br>contrast Community as Willie James<br>Jennings puts it<br>all of the speakers have had examples or<br>given glimpses of alternative systems<br>that seem to work better than the time<br>honored traditional way of doing things<br>and yet they continue to seek to be part<br>of and to change the system<br>for this student the most exciting<br>alternative they had heard of was the<br>cons the circle of concerned African<br>women theologians which has been such an<br>important space for women to do theology<br>together communally in Africa<br>it draws on women from all backgrounds<br>cultures and religions it's diverse and<br>it's a loose and flat Collective a<br>really good model<br>African-American scholar and social<br>activist Bell hooks who died in 2021<br>and Willie James Jenning both offer ways<br>forward again with two arresting<br>metaphors or ideas one Eros and the<br>other the crowd<br>Bell hooks writes about a passion for<br>learning what she names as Eros<br>this is not meant in a sexual sense but<br>rather in terms of an energy or a<br>passion that propels us towards learning<br>as an adventure<br>she tells us that Eros can be a<br>powerfully motivating force<br>and that it can provide in a<br>epistemological grounding informing how<br>we know what we know<br>and to use such ways to invigorate<br>discussion and to excite the critical<br>imagination<br>it's an energy that drives us towards<br>Discovery and wholeness as well as<br>towards co-learning and co-creation of<br>knowledge<br>one student told me recently that she<br>thinks people no longer seat out seek<br>out experts who impart information to<br>them<br>a Master Slave model perhaps<br>but rather that people prefer to join in<br>learning together<br>and Jennings believes that theological<br>education has within it<br>theological education has as its<br>fundamental resource erotic power<br>and that power Finds Its home in the<br>Divine ecstasy in which God relentlessly<br>gives God's self to us<br>joyfully opening the Divine Life as our<br>habitation<br>so I think that's a fine sounding<br>sentiment but what does that actually<br>mean<br>I think that this this power can only be<br>entered through participation<br>and that I think is the promise and the<br>challenge<br>with whom do we participate<br>Joe Jennings also offers the metaphor of<br>the crowd and I think that's quite an<br>intriguing one he says that Jesus<br>attracted crowds<br>and that he often gathered people around<br>him who preferred not to be together<br>he reminds us of God's power to end<br>hostility and to draw Us in all of<br>creation into reconciliation one that we<br>do not control but one that will<br>recreate and reform us<br>and Jenning State claims this starts<br>with the community with community<br>the crowd<br>so for this to happen we need to be in<br>shared spaces<br>so that we can share life together<br>it means Gathering Together those who<br>may even prefer not to be together<br>Jennings insists that we must be willing<br>to live towards a different formation of<br>place and space<br>he says we fight against the segregation<br>that shapes our worlds and we work to<br>weave lives together<br>and he goes on to explore the concept of<br>forming a contrast community and he says<br>that these communities must be formed on<br>the actual ground in neighborhoods and<br>In Living Spaces<br>it's in our shared Living Spaces<br>it was with my neighbors in lockdown and<br>our meetups and subsequently<br>it was it's in our friendships and being<br>together in the same space and in<br>conversations that learning and change<br>can happen<br>imagine a learning community who<br>welcomes all across all the lines that<br>might divide us<br>a contrast community that is formed on<br>the actual ground in neighborhoods and<br>learning spaces<br>so that we experience the gifts and<br>challenges we can offer one another<br>so after whiteness means that we need a<br>new discourse and a new posture when it<br>comes to education and to Mission<br>in his book Multicultural Kingdom ethnic<br>diversity Mission and the church my<br>colleague Harvey quiani asserts that in<br>our current context in the UK he says<br>diversity is The New Normal<br>and that our discourse Spirit the<br>missional church conversation the<br>emerging Church missionary congregations<br>or fresh expressions of Church Must<br>so I'd like to conclude the two stories<br>one from the 19th century and a more<br>contemporary one both involve women from<br>Africa<br>so the first one is about a Rubina<br>and this is a story that I discovered<br>from a former CMS General Secretary<br>Simon Barrington Ward who narrates this<br>moving story of a Rubina<br>she was a prophet a woman leader and<br>Trader in the 1880s in Niger<br>she had been filled with the Holy Spirit<br>in a mission-led church<br>the CMS Church probably<br>and she learned how to read from the<br>local CMS missionary so that she could<br>and this is what Barrington Ward writes<br>a Robina saw a nice<br>a new love<br>a new all-pervasive spirit Power<br>the possibility of a new people<br>a fellowship of the unlike<br>those are my italics I love that phrase<br>I feel like this is what Jennings is<br>talking about the contrast community<br>a fellowship of the unlike bonding<br>together all tribes all ethnic groups<br>both black and white and to a new<br>Society<br>here the rich would care for the poor<br>and the strong for the weak and what was<br>to be a new Heaven and a new Earth<br>so a fantastic vision<br>the movement grew enormously<br>not only drawing in young people and all<br>ethnic groups<br>unfortunately it also created conflicts<br>with the elders and with the<br>missionaries<br>and Simon Barrington Ward writes how<br>eventually the CMS missionaries came in<br>to tidy things up to conform to a tidier<br>colonial mindset<br>he says a CMS shaped and trained the new<br>church to fit in with a wider Colonial<br>world<br>a much more individualized spiritualized<br>faith seemed appropriate along with a<br>largely utilitarian education<br>and everybody ended up being a matron<br>and a CMS girls hostel<br>but nevertheless ever been a story gives<br>me hope to embody a new discourse a new<br>posture a new action<br>she came to Christ in a mission context<br>she lived out her faith in a way<br>appropriate to her own place and space<br>and time her own context yes it was shut<br>down by the missionaries in the colonial<br>mindset but it shows that it is possible<br>to live out and rejoice in diversity<br>indeed to become a fellowship of the<br>unlike<br>she was also then<br>as is perhaps still the case now sadly<br>an unlikely leader<br>she was originally an illiterate woman<br>he led people into a fellowship of the<br>unlike<br>where are those leaders Among Us<br>are they even Among Us<br>and would we even recognize them if they<br>were<br>and how are we part of developing<br>fellowships of the unlike in our<br>contexts<br>how are we intentionally encouraging<br>interaction with difference<br>and one final story to encourage us to<br>take action<br>so recently at our postgrad research day<br>we had Dr Lisa Ajay speak to us she<br>works for Christian age in the UK and<br>she spoke to us about racial Justice<br>and she asked us<br>she finished by asking us to please stop<br>touching her toes<br>so I found this to be a very arresting<br>metaphor what does she mean please stop<br>touching my toes<br>so she explained to us that as a black<br>woman of Ghanaian descent<br>she is sick and tired of white people<br>offering to or actually washing the feet<br>of black of people of color and wanting<br>to repent<br>what she wants to see is repentance<br>followed by action and change changed<br>Behavior<br>she exhorted white people to stop<br>touching her feet and I found this to be<br>a powerful and memorable image and a<br>Clarion cry to action<br>Lisa is one of the co-founders of the<br>Sankofa Collective<br>a community of Christians committed to<br>racial Justice Anisha told us about the<br>four pillars of their Collective and I<br>thought this might have some resonances<br>for arterio New Zealand<br>telling the whole truth about our<br>history<br>taking time to Lament<br>to repent and forgive<br>and to change systems<br>it's my colleague Harvey Queen aquiani<br>then led us in a time of reflection and<br>he asked us to write down one action we<br>could take as a result of repenting<br>and one student wrote that he repented<br>so I don't think that we can engage in<br>Mission today without an awareness of<br>the impact of colonialism<br>and of the wide and the impact of<br>colonialism<br>and of The Wider context of racism in<br>our society and our world<br>we then need a willingness to take<br>action<br>African-American activist and theologian<br>James Cohn alerts us to White<br>Christianity's ability to talk<br>abstractly about the love of God while<br>similar whilst simultaneously allowing<br>racism colonialism and Empire to<br>flourish<br>he claims that whites do not talk about<br>racism because we do not have to<br>because of our guilt and because we do<br>not want to engage with black rage<br>and because we are not prepared for a<br>radical redistribution of wealth and<br>power<br>Anthony Reddy does not mince his words<br>when he says<br>and critiquing whiteness I am talking<br>about a thorough deconstruction of the<br>toxic relationship between Christianity<br>Empire and Notions of white British<br>superiority<br>so to conclude daily meetups with my<br>neighbors and encountering a powerful<br>metaphor from Willie James Jennings have<br>challenged me to think more deeply about<br>whiteness and racial Justice<br>and my dream is for our learning<br>community at CMS<br>to become a fellowship of the unlike a<br>contrast Community where we learn<br>together across all boundaries<br>two years ago we introduced a new<br>program and for African Christian<br>diaspora students<br>so we now have two parallel programs one<br>for African diaspora students and one<br>for Pioneer student studying Mission and<br>these students Share three quarters of<br>the modules together<br>so this is beginning towards to move<br>towards my dream<br>as we learn about our own postures<br>experience not only our own discomfort<br>but also the gift of diversity<br>we are learning what it might mean to<br>have to decolonize our own<br>individualistic pedagogies to become<br>more communal and perhaps even a<br>contrast community<br>to decolonize Mission education and the<br>curriculum more generally<br>to move towards reconciliate<br>reconciliation and Justice and<br>Multicultural learning and to frame<br>Mission education in terms of Hope<br>so for the last minute I'd like you to<br>look at your circles again<br>the circles that you had at the<br>beginning<br>do you look at these any differently<br>having heard this so I'll give you a<br>minute<br>to create an Outer Circle in which you<br>can write one action that you might take<br>as a result of listening to this<br>so if you've got room creation out of<br>circle if not just have a look at what<br>you've got there and write one action<br>that you might take as a result of<br>having had this presentation</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
