it's<br>been wonderful to have you and welcome<br>wonderful to welcome you for this fun<br>final lecture this evening we have been<br>on an adventure an adventure of the<br>imagination we have been exploring<br>Mission lament and hope we've been<br>through Mission and Hospitality we've<br>explored Mission and salvation we've<br>considered Mission and whiteness Mission<br>and Empire and now we're thinking about<br>how we join in with God in this<br>adventure of mission and so thank you<br>Kathy for your engaging and insightful<br>and inspiring lectures over these past<br>five and we look forward to this<br>good evening everybody and thank you for<br>coming again thank you to those of you<br>who've come to everyone thank you to<br>those online and particular thanks to<br>Hugh and Anne Morrison for hosting me<br>last week and Lynn and Steve Taylor this<br>week and to the theology faculty here<br>for inviting me and hosting me and to<br>the funders thank you for making this<br>possible<br>so um tonight to be thinking about<br>another world as possible Mission as an<br>adventure of the imagination<br>so I hope that during these the series<br>of lectures we've seen how Mission can<br>be an adventure and as Lind has<br>mentioned we've gone on a journey from<br>Mission as lament hospitality<br>perhaps a larger understanding of<br>salvation<br>thinking about race and Empire<br>and all Concepts which relate to Mission<br>and all this is part of doing joining in<br>with God and trying to make our world a<br>better place<br>through knowing god<br>so this evening I want to draw on the<br>writings of John Taylor who was a formal<br>General Secretary of CMS from 1963 to<br>74.<br>and during my last study leave I had the<br>privilege of reading his travel Diaries<br>and he wrote eight extensive travel<br>Diaries during his time as general<br>secretary and 121 CMS newsletters<br>so these reflect his own mythological<br>thinking and ideas and direction of<br>travel essentially the newsletters are<br>1500 to 2000 words of accessible current<br>and creative mythological thinking and<br>they always included a few Reflections<br>from his current reading related to the<br>topic in the newsletter<br>and so after reading the Diaries and the<br>newsletters I had a lot of really<br>interesting material to draw on and I'm<br>going to present some of that here my<br>own distillation of his creative ideas I<br>think you'll see how prophetic and<br>present he was<br>um so he he started off in Mission with<br>10 years as a mission partner in Uganda<br>and it was during that time and his<br>travels as general secretary were very<br>important influences on his thinking and<br>writing which are creative and<br>imaginative he loved the Arts he was a<br>published poet and he was a photographer<br>as well as a musician he was an<br>improviser and a creative<br>his posture was one of humble listening<br>a 10 attentive curiosity and Lively<br>interest in the world around him and<br>that really made him a very attractive<br>person and mentor<br>and I think this is what makes his<br>writing so captivating and exciting for<br>us today over half a century later<br>theology for John Taylor is living<br>functional and practical<br>his 10 years of teaching theology in the<br>Ugandan language in Uganda<br>from 1945 to 1954 forced him to think in<br>concrete terms<br>so he wrote of teaching during that time<br>that this exercise instilled in me the<br>realization that every abstract idea<br>including our idea of God is derived<br>from experience<br>and all Revelation is given through<br>things that happen<br>and this had a proud a profound<br>influence on his understanding of<br>Theology and Mission<br>theology is living<br>it emerges out of a dynamic encounter<br>with the world<br>and in fact later he asserts there is no<br>John Taylor is best known these days<br>certainly in the UK for his succinct and<br>popular definition of mission<br>which is seeing what God is doing in a<br>situation and trying to do it along with<br>God<br>this in christology and the spirit as<br>Jesus had his eyes opened by the spirit<br>to recognize God at work in the world<br>and as disciples we are called to take<br>the same position in relation to Jesus<br>as Jesus had in relation to the father<br>Mission we we see Mission as a longing<br>to see all things renewed our<br>relationship with God and with one<br>another with our environment and species<br>with our societies our world and our<br>Cosmos<br>it's the healing and Redemption of all<br>things under the lordship of Christ<br>ultimately for Taylor and for us at CMS<br>we believe that mission is indeed an<br>adventure of the imagination to pick up<br>another of his phrases we love this idea<br>of Adventure<br>that implies risk Journey Quest<br>exploration imagination<br>we are actually convinced that the<br>church needs more imagination<br>the context for this phrase and<br>adventure of the imagination comes from<br>an earlier book of Taylors the Primal<br>Vision which he wrote after living in<br>Uganda<br>and he wrote any attempt to look upon<br>the world through African eyes must<br>involve an adventure of the imagination<br>and here we see his willingness to take<br>context and culture seriously and to do<br>the hard work of imagining what it might<br>mean to root the gospel in another<br>culture<br>so let's embark on this adventure and<br>discuss some of his ideas<br>so imagine Mission as sharing the gospel<br>in all humility and gentleness and that<br>photo by the way is some street art from<br>Christchurch<br>cms's founding story is to share Jesus<br>with those who do not know him in places<br>where the gospel is not known<br>this is what mission was about for our<br>early CMS forbids and it is still a<br>distinctive Mark of CMS today<br>sharing the good news of Jesus with<br>those who are beyond the reach of the<br>church<br>and obviously this will mean engaging in<br>evangelism<br>kind of evangelism that uplifts and<br>shows Jesus so that people may see him<br>and truly seeing me believe in him whose<br>coming has completely transformed the<br>human situation and through whom a<br>so Taylor was well aware that the<br>practice of evangelism could be much<br>abused<br>and So He suggests an evangelism that is<br>practiced in all humility and gentleness<br>and and one of his newsletters where he<br>reflects on Christian witness in China<br>he sharply criticizes the use of power<br>and wealth and evangelism<br>he says the use of superior power to<br>commend the gospel<br>whether the power of money or the power<br>of expertise or the power of access to<br>political Authority<br>even though it is used to do good and to<br>serve the needy unconditionally may<br>result in conversions but many of them<br>will be conversions to the more<br>successful way of life not conversions<br>to Jesus Christ<br>and he believed that when the reaction<br>to this approach sets in then it may<br>also mean a rejection of Jesus whose<br>name is associated with this method<br>he makes a plea that we power conscious<br>westerners learn the secret of Paul's<br>method<br>to quote Paul from one Corinthians for I<br>decided to know nothing among you except<br>Jesus Christ and him crucified and I<br>came to you in weakness<br>and in fear and in much trembling<br>Taylor implored us to open our minds and<br>to see things from the Chinese point of<br>view so as to prepare ourselves for a<br>creative interchange with Chinese people<br>when the opportunity presents itself<br>he reminds us that at that time in 1973<br>our most telling form of witness to our<br>Lord's power<br>will not be the things that we can say<br>to China<br>but our Readiness to listen to what<br>China is saying to us<br>this remains A continuing challenge in<br>each of our contexts as we need to<br>listen to what each of the contexts is<br>saying to us<br>and what gifts they may bring us<br>in our Western secular and<br>post-christian contexts it may be that<br>our evangelism is best modeled and<br>communicated by lifestyle and presence<br>and in a newsletter where he reflected<br>on the challenges that Christians face<br>in as a minority in Muslim countries in<br>the Middle East he quoted Kenneth Craig<br>who reminds us of the approach of the<br>minor of the minority early church<br>Craig wrote it was not by any despairing<br>withdrawal from the city and Market that<br>they conquered the world nor by any<br>proud isolation or selfish security not<br>by any impatient violence<br>but by the winning influence of a<br>gracious faith<br>they mastered the family the school the<br>empire<br>so while we may react to the language of<br>conquering and mastering I hope we can<br>see that an evangelism of presence and a<br>lifestyle of Hope and perseverance can<br>be an attractive Witness<br>this approach to mission may be the most<br>fruitful when engaged in by a team or a<br>community who are discovering together<br>what it means to live out the Practical<br>implications of their discipleship in<br>imagine mission is sharing the gospel<br>with creativity and Imagination<br>so we think at CMS that we need a Fresh<br>Approach to the presentation of the<br>gospel and a new approach to evangelism<br>is the Christendom era is over<br>and people no longer know what our faith<br>was<br>nor really find meaning in it when it's<br>explained<br>Taylor quotes Hungarian journalist<br>Arthur kirstler who suggested in his<br>book The Act of Creation that creativity<br>derives from two normally incompatible<br>ideas<br>and affirms the vitality and power of<br>signs symbols and analogies<br>he also emphasized the value of seeing<br>the connections and Taylor picks up on<br>this when he writes that this reminds me<br>that a great part of true evangelism is<br>just that an ability to see the<br>connection between the changeless gospel<br>and the immediate circumstance<br>and Taylor believes that because so few<br>have or learned this ability the gospel<br>lives only in its own expected frame of<br>reference<br>and there's no creative fresh Vitality<br>so as I've said we love this idea of<br>mission as an adventure of the<br>imagination and this idea of trying to<br>be creative in its presentation and<br>bringing together perhaps incompatible<br>ideas signs symbols analogies<br>we desperately need the script of<br>imagination and our post-modern and<br>post-christian Western contexts<br>and perhaps an indirect method method of<br>evangelism is more likely to gain a<br>hearing and response<br>Taylor argues for more creativity more<br>imagination a more gentle and nuanced<br>cultivation as we engage with people<br>he says the Evangelist as Paul as Saint<br>Paul well on you<br>has to cultivate what grows from God's<br>planting without trampling it with his<br>own dogmatic boots<br>and may it not be that if we are ever to<br>learn how to sing the Lord's song and<br>the Strange Land of our secular world we<br>shall have to learn to use more of his<br>obliquity<br>honestly for those of you who teach<br>preaching<br>should use this quotation<br>I do sometimes feel that sermons labor<br>the point let's have some obliquity and<br>just<br>just leave something to the imagination<br>so I love that quotation<br>if we do not use the Divine imagination<br>given to us we will be embarrassed by a<br>world capable of far more imagination<br>than the church itself<br>what we need is not more technique but<br>more imagination to see the Unseen and<br>what is familiar and contemporary and to<br>offer it to people is a parable and all<br>its liability to be missed or<br>misunderstood<br>we need to cultivate our imaginations<br>along these lines so that we can<br>Intrigue and surprise when we present<br>the gospel<br>so that people are given the opportunity<br>to discover for themselves what gifts<br>Jesus brings and what the cost of<br>imagine Mission as local<br>so we believe that mission is best done<br>by the Insiders or the local people<br>the gospel is universal but the gospel's<br>thought forms metaphors and the way it's<br>communicated will vary from place to<br>place and age to age<br>each age in context needs imagination to<br>communicate the gospel of fresh<br>and this is best done by Insiders<br>if the gospel is to be genuinely<br>understood and lived out by a local<br>culture and context<br>then the locals are the best ones to<br>work this out<br>and we think we need to be far more<br>radical in allowing this to happen<br>we whoever we may be the westerners the<br>older Christians the incomers and onto a<br>local housing estate need to let go and<br>to allow the Insiders to get hold of the<br>Gospel<br>understand it and live it in ways that<br>make sense to them<br>too often we want to protect to guard<br>and to defend the gospel<br>thereby limiting its power and potential<br>to embed and root itself in the local<br>context<br>we become what John Taylor has called<br>the guardians of universality<br>and therefore mistrust the local and the<br>particular<br>we need not be afraid of the local<br>instead we need to allow the locals to<br>mine their own culture for its riches<br>seams and veins that can begin to<br>communicate the gospel afresh<br>the word is basic everywhere<br>but the thought forms the metaphors the<br>logic in which it is communicated these<br>differ from culture to culture and from<br>age to age<br>even the story of Salvation may have to<br>be told differently as each of the four<br>gospels demonstrates<br>worship theology ethics Ministry each of<br>these are Universal but must be rooted<br>in the local context if they are to be<br>authentic and to make sense in that<br>context<br>so let me give you a couple of striking<br>examples from John Taylor to illustrate<br>this<br>so the first is from Pakistan<br>in 1969<br>and he picks up on the idea of how best<br>to communicate the gospel using signs<br>and symbols<br>so at this stage Pakistan had been<br>independent for only 20 years largely a<br>Muslim country<br>and Taylor questioned imagine this for<br>the General Secretary of a Mission<br>Society he questioned whether the public<br>display of the cross<br>was the most appropriate way of<br>representing the gospel in that context<br>this is not because he wanted to mute or<br>silence the gospel<br>but because he believed that watch this<br>sign communicated in that context was<br>anything but the gospel for Pakistan<br>as a symbol at encapsulated centuries of<br>misunderstanding<br>and reminded them not only of the<br>Crusades but also of more recent<br>ultimately he agreed that the cross is<br>too unique and fundamental a symbol to<br>be given up<br>but all depended on how it is displayed<br>he cited the example of a Christian<br>Hospital in the Punjab which created an<br>uproar with their display of a flat-lit<br>cross on the top of its building<br>he said that I would contend is the<br>wrong way to honor the symbol of the<br>crucified<br>he then pondered what might be a more<br>appropriate symbol of service and<br>sacrifice for Pakistan<br>and he found it in a humble domestic<br>object already present in many Christian<br>homes<br>the short-handled broom<br>if it were adapted as the mark of<br>Christian Allegiance he wrote it would<br>certainly be a scandal and an object of<br>Shame<br>just as The Gallows cross was in the<br>early days of the church<br>he explained that the term Christian is<br>almost synonymous with sweeper it's 45<br>percent of Christians and then West<br>Pakistan were indeed sweepers<br>another 35 percent belong to an even<br>poorer section of society the landless<br>serfs<br>this is a poor Church a struggling<br>church trying to live out its faith in a<br>majority Muslim context<br>see here I think is an example which<br>demonstrates the kind of imagination and<br>creativity we need to contextualize the<br>gospel locally<br>using local symbols that are immediately<br>understood within the context<br>we believe that this is the kind of<br>radical thinking and questioning that we<br>need to engage in today to communicate<br>the gospel afresh<br>and another example he gave us from<br>India where Metropolitan like dassa de<br>male challenged the local church to take<br>off the trousers before we can put on<br>the duty<br>he implored the Indian Church to put off<br>her institutionalism<br>for it is that which is Western through<br>and through<br>we can see that this approach is<br>dishonoring to Christ if Jesus Christ is<br>only presented in a foreign way for how<br>will Indians come to know Christ as one<br>of them<br>living in their neighborhoods if he is<br>presented only in trousers<br>and Western trousers rather than in<br>local clothing<br>the gospel must permeate all of Indian<br>Society so that Indians can live and<br>experience the gospel in an Indian way<br>this also applies to language and<br>translation both linguistic translation<br>of Christian Concepts but also<br>translating those into an authentically<br>Indian expression of what it means to<br>live as an Indian Christian in their<br>place and space<br>where might the spirit be at work to<br>help discern that<br>and perhaps the clue Taylor thought<br>might be in their great Hindu heritage<br>could Indian Christians mind their Rich<br>Heritage of artists musicians thinkers<br>philosophers poets<br>so that the gospel could be presented<br>and experienced as a truly Indian<br>treasure<br>if so this opens up all sorts of<br>interesting and exciting possibilities<br>Scottish Mission historian Andrew walls<br>has alerted alerted us to the emergence<br>of world Christianity in the global<br>church and he warns us in the west<br>against arrogance and myopia<br>he writes like the old Jerusalem<br>Christians Western Christians have long<br>grown used to the idea that they were<br>guardians of a standard Christianity<br>also like them they find themselves in<br>the presence of new expressions of<br>Christianity and new Christian<br>lifestyles<br>to display Christ under the conditions<br>of African Indian Chinese Korean and<br>Latin American Life<br>so we can react by wanting to protect<br>our own version of Christianity and<br>declaring it as the normative one the<br>default setting<br>or we can declare that each expression<br>is indeed valid and then proceed to<br>enjoy our own and isolation from the<br>others<br>walls rejects both these options and<br>instead introduces the temple and body<br>metaphors to counter this<br>he writes the Ephesian metaphors of the<br>tampon and of the body show each of the<br>culture specific segments as necessary<br>to the body but incomplete in itself<br>we need one another to enlarge correct<br>Challenge and refocus our understanding<br>of Christ<br>Within These different worlds and fresh<br>ideas can be just as useful to<br>Christianity worldwide as Greek<br>philosophy and thought had been to the<br>European outworking of their faith<br>even more exciting is that this<br>uncovering of the Gospel is a two-way<br>process of mutuality<br>Christianity is nurtured by an<br>in-cultural encounters and then in turn<br>develops and nurtures these cultures<br>for example it was only when the Chinese<br>took in Jesus Took in Jesus and nurtured<br>and understood him in Confucian ways<br>that he became Chinese enough to be<br>understood<br>and this way other cultures can also<br>benefit from the chineseness of the<br>Gospel and the creative interchange that<br>is backed by this<br>and this is as true in Britain or in<br>artero New Zealand as overseas<br>Taylor wrote in his time I mean the<br>House Church in Britain the outlying<br>bush Church in Africa and any other<br>local christian community group can do<br>this<br>these are the growing edges of the<br>church<br>but the center finds it hard to allow<br>these edges to grow<br>he writes the Guardians of universality<br>mistrust the particular and thereby<br>destroy the source from which a greater<br>universality might arise<br>Taylor does not have a romantic side of<br>view of this nor is he sentimental about<br>it he's well aware that nationalism and<br>ethnocentrism can arise which could cut<br>off the local church from The Wider<br>Christian body<br>but the opposite can also be true<br>the worldwide church is indeed renewed<br>by insights from the local and the<br>particular<br>insights that emerge from a particular<br>local context can offer a wider<br>perspective to the whole<br>authentic universality is neither<br>maintained nor created by control from<br>the center<br>and mistrust from the center can be<br>damaging<br>it's exactly when we allow our<br>indigenous values and virtues Redeemed<br>by Christ to be offered to and<br>experienced by The Wider church that a<br>greater universality<br>might then develop in the World Church<br>Taylor asserts to be indigenous<br>therefore means simply to be free to<br>respond to Christ and to the world<br>without any of the self-consciousness<br>which is imposed by the attitudes of<br>others<br>imagine Mission as being<br>on the edges<br>CMS has recently adopted a more<br>intentional approach in our work which<br>is to be at the edges<br>now I know the edges and Center are<br>contested language where is the center<br>and where are the edges and who says who<br>determines this<br>and those who are deemed to beat the<br>edges may not necessarily feel<br>themselves to be at the edges wherever<br>the edge actually is<br>so it can sound a little patronizing but<br>bear with me<br>one of the things we say at CMS is come<br>with us to the edges and discover God at<br>work in ways you may not have expected<br>Jesus loved those on the edges or<br>margins of society<br>he was drawn to them<br>the women and children the unclean the<br>prostitutes the tax collectors the<br>unwell<br>he healed them<br>he removed their burdens of Shame he<br>noticed them He restored their dignity<br>as I've already mentioned<br>African-American Theologian Willie James<br>Jennings tells us that Jesus attracted<br>crowds and that he often attracted<br>people around him who preferred not to<br>be together<br>people from the edges and elsewhere<br>Peruvian Liberation Theologian Gustavo<br>Gutierrez writes powerfully about<br>exercising a preferential option for the<br>poor not because the poor are better<br>than others or more virtuous<br>but because what the preferential option<br>for the poor reveals<br>is that the calculus of the Gospel is<br>not the same as our worlds<br>and present structures<br>attention is given first to the powerful<br>and the wealthy with the poor receiving<br>perhaps The Leftovers<br>this is far from Universal love<br>but only when we opt preferentially for<br>the poorest and weakest<br>can we even begin to display<br>universality<br>anything less is Tainted with the<br>exclusive ways of present social<br>structures<br>Taylor was well aware of this and I<br>think he would have approved of our<br>strapline as he wrote<br>if you're concerned with movement and<br>growth in a church or in a society look<br>to the fringes<br>watch the things that are pushing out on<br>so the CMS strap line again come with us<br>to the edges and discover God at work in<br>ways you might not have expected<br>so we might like to reflect on where are<br>the edges for us are we there<br>and what are we learning that will<br>imagine Mission as cherishing the<br>with financial challenges already<br>present and looming for the foreseeable<br>future<br>I think we are learning or we're having<br>to learn to cherish the weakness of<br>limited means<br>we are learning to cherish weakness and<br>vulnerability<br>uncertainty and our inability to fix<br>things<br>when we do this then the temptation to<br>wield power and collect capital is<br>minimalized<br>this is a challenge to the Church of<br>England in particular<br>which over the centuries has accumulated<br>massive assets<br>property and developed a clericalized<br>bureaucracy<br>if the church had been able to sit more<br>lightly to power and resources it might<br>look less like a multinational with<br>assets<br>property portfolios and investment<br>managers<br>and more like the movement whose founder<br>issued worldly power and resources<br>limited means also has a beneficial side<br>effect that we have to trust and rely on<br>God rather than on our own resources<br>it forces us to be creative and<br>Innovative imaginative and responsive as<br>we work with the weakness of limited<br>means rather than Limitless resources<br>unsurprisingly we are finding that this<br>could put us in line with most of the<br>rest of the world who are very familiar<br>with the reality of limited means<br>Taylor developed a new word to describe<br>a quality of mind or a posture for<br>engaging in Mission that reflects this<br>a preference for traveling light as if<br>on a permanent picnic knowing that what<br>matters is the person not the<br>possessions<br>conviction not convention<br>the ability to travel light and not to<br>be cluttered by possessions is clearly<br>linked to material poverty as well as to<br>a poverty of spirit<br>we do not have either as creatures or as<br>a planet Limitless resources nor do we<br>need them<br>and I think we have all learned that<br>enough is enough<br>and that we need to develop a Theology<br>of enough<br>we are learning that we need to respect<br>the planet<br>and not to be consumerist and<br>extravagant<br>in 1972 over 50 years ago John Taylor<br>wrote<br>our Western way of life<br>is marked by excess whichever aspect of<br>our situation one looks at<br>our consumption of food and our<br>accumulation of goods<br>our wage claims and price Rises our<br>waste and pollution<br>the concentration and congestion of our<br>cities<br>our destruction of living creatures and<br>our plunder of fuels and minerals<br>our expenditure on armaments and the<br>wanton disproportion of the way we use<br>them<br>excess is the word that comes<br>continually to mind ruthless<br>unbridled unthinking excess<br>if you want to read a challenging book<br>he wrote a book called enough is enough<br>back in the 70s<br>and it develops some of those ideas<br>around this<br>perhaps the pandemic<br>has forced us to review our Western way<br>of life<br>and to ask some searching questions<br>about it<br>what do we want our world and our<br>communities to look like<br>Taylor called the Old Testament<br>Community the kingdom of right<br>relationships which embodied a Theology<br>of enough<br>creditors were instructed to exercise<br>restraint all loans had to be interest<br>interest free and every seventh Year all<br>loans were forgiven<br>surely a community of right<br>relationships a Beloved Community is<br>envisaged by Martin Luther King or<br>Willie James Jennings crowd or contrast<br>Community could model this as a<br>community that is based on love Justice<br>a Theology of enough does not<br>necessarily mean though a scarcity<br>mindset<br>too often we have succumbed to this to a<br>scarcity mindset rather than looking for<br>the resources that already exist in a<br>community or context<br>community theologians Al Barrett and<br>Ruth Harley in Birmingham have<br>discovered this in their work at Hodge<br>Hill<br>they write about a gift economy to be<br>discovered and shared<br>they write gifts within individual human<br>beings but also gifts that can be<br>discovered in particular relationships<br>and groups and associations and places<br>and stories and traditions and events<br>and encounters and Split Second moments<br>they go on to consider the assets that<br>can be found in any community and assert<br>that we can only find these when we<br>begin to wait and see the place through<br>our neighbors eyes as well as through<br>our own<br>North American researcher and<br>sociologist brene Brown believes that we<br>live in a culture of scarcity the Never<br>Enough problem<br>she says we wake up in the morning and<br>we say I didn't get enough sleep I'm not<br>good enough I'm not clever enough I'm<br>not pretty enough or whatever and she<br>maintains that the opposite of scarcity<br>is not abundance<br>but rather the opposite of scarcity is<br>enough or what she calls<br>wholeheartedness<br>according to Brown wholehearted Living<br>requires living with risk and<br>uncertainty<br>to cultivate this we need to practice<br>creativity resilience gratitude and joy<br>play and rest among other things<br>and along with an appreciation of gift<br>these are values and postures that we<br>can take into our understanding of<br>mission<br>so a Theology of nuff encourages<br>contentment a Theology of enough<br>encourages contentment gratitude and<br>humility and fosters generosity<br>a Theology of enough allows forgive and<br>take<br>if we could model these attitudes in our<br>relationship with Humanity creatures and<br>the cosmos then our mission might begin<br>to look more humble organic and mutual<br>we may also find it easier to cherish<br>Mission will mean conversion and<br>conversion is a turning<br>a radical reorientation of a person<br>towards God<br>a change relationship through repentance<br>and faith in Christ<br>so we need to face some difficult<br>questions as to what conversion means<br>and how it works in cultures with little<br>or no Christian Heritage<br>and to be realistic about the challenge<br>this presents<br>Taylor writes but is that kind of<br>repentance and Faith immediately<br>possible to a person whose ideas and<br>attitudes are completely Untouched by<br>what we might call the presuppositions<br>of the Bible<br>words such as Sin life and death May<br>mean something different or even nothing<br>at all so something else must happen<br>before the gospel can even be heard<br>the culmination of evangelism is<br>conversion<br>but it seems that God may be more<br>patient with people than we are<br>and that God's ways of eliciting a<br>response are more varied and unexpected<br>than many of ours<br>indeed Taylor asserts that usually sin<br>although God may be patient it is<br>nonetheless true that conversion May<br>cost us everything and can cause much<br>suffering<br>during<br>Taylor's visit to Nepal in 1968 he met<br>with Christians who had been imprisoned<br>for their faith<br>he spent time with Prem a Nepali Pastor<br>who had spent four years in prison for<br>faith in Christ<br>and although he knew that baptism could<br>result in imprisonment he continued to<br>baptize people and had baptized 23 in<br>he said I never baptize anyone until I<br>know that he or she is able to Bear<br>suffering<br>for me that was the most significant<br>word of the evening John Taylor wrote<br>non-essential obstacles must be removed<br>but we cannot remove the cross<br>and that and its specific form for each<br>situation confronts would-be disciple at<br>the start it isn't reserved for more<br>mature Christians Taylor wrote<br>the Rich Young Ruler had to abandon his<br>privilege as a condition of discipleship<br>and has come into Christ had social as<br>well as political implications<br>there are no Universal rules<br>each situation has to be measured and<br>so the heart of the problem<br>Taylor oats are the heart of the problem<br>seems to be to distinguish between the<br>stone of stumbling Christ lays before<br>those who support who approach him as an<br>unescapable demand<br>and the stumbling blocks which we create<br>unnecessarily while calling them basic<br>so this requires much discernment and<br>wisdom<br>for Taylor salvation is a down-to-earth<br>salvation and is far from an abstract<br>concept<br>he believes that Jesus only knows saving<br>faith and concrete responses<br>salvation comes to Zacchaeus when his<br>new relationship with Jesus compels him<br>to return half his Goods to the poor and<br>repay four times what he had cheated<br>salvation comes to the Samaritan Napa<br>not when he was healed but when he<br>returned to thank Jesus<br>furthermore Taylor asserts no one is<br>saved by acknowledging a Doctrine<br>he writes<br>you will search in vain for any<br>systematic doctrine of salvation in the<br>instance in which he makes men whole<br>and his vocabulary no distinction is<br>made between the healing of a body and<br>the saving of a soul and in his eyes<br>faith is equally Faith whether it be<br>whether it be the Instinct of a foreign<br>army officer to take him at his word<br>or the commitment which he prays that<br>Peter will not lose in his hour of<br>Temptation<br>imagine Mission as dangerous<br>our practice of mission is undergirded<br>by our theology<br>Taylor believes there's no such thing as<br>a safe theology<br>because a theology that is in touch with<br>the world will be a living theology with<br>all its attendant risks mistakes and<br>developments<br>theology has a missionary role in its<br>task to communicate the truths of a<br>gospel in a world that is constantly<br>changing<br>therefore theology must emerge out of a<br>dynamic encounter with the world<br>a Theology of mission that is grounded<br>and rooted in current realities must be<br>interdisciplinary and ask searching and<br>challenging questions<br>nearly 50 years ago<br>back in 1976 Kenyan Theologian John and<br>Beatty inserted asserted that we are<br>charismatically Universal but<br>theologically provincial<br>in other words we believe in and<br>proclaim a universal gospel but we allow<br>our theology to remain limited and<br>constrained by our own safe provincial<br>Horizons<br>on visits to India Taylor encountered a<br>distinctive Indian theology which had<br>emerged from the creative response of<br>Hindu thinkers to Jesus<br>he dared to suggest that this has<br>brought about a kind of Renaissance<br>within Hinduism itself<br>he devoted an entire newsletter to<br>Indian theology that had emerged in<br>conversation with Hinduism<br>lamenting the fact that European and<br>American schools theological schools had<br>taken little notice of this<br>he found this to be absurd<br>as this theology offers us a new<br>approach to the meaning of Christ<br>he insisted on the Christ witness of<br>Hinduism<br>and explored how some deeply Hindu ideas<br>can be helpful to opening up our<br>appreciation of Jesus<br>Taylor does not accept everything<br>uncritically but what is exciting is the<br>openness to new thought forms to<br>different worlds and fresh ideas<br>so that Indian thought can be made just<br>as useful to Christianity as Greek<br>he did the same in his encounter with<br>Japanese Theologian koyama who taught<br>here I think<br>picking up on koianas and koyama's<br>insight of the crucified mind<br>Taylor gets to the heart of the issue<br>here with his extraordinary Insight only<br>the crucified mind is free and<br>self-emptied enough to enter a people's<br>context and culture<br>and feel the pressures of its particular<br>continues that what the whole Human<br>family is waiting for<br>is the emergence of a crucified African<br>mind a crucified Chinese mind a<br>crucified European mind<br>these are the kinds of insights which<br>emerge from very different local<br>contexts and demonstrate what the local<br>can offer to the church Universal in<br>terms of theology witness discipleship<br>and spirituality<br>he does the same with his reading of<br>African theologians championing the<br>contributions that they can offer to our<br>understanding of theology<br>he was particularly taken by ambitious<br>discussion of Bantu approaches to time<br>and the contrast with the Western<br>post-renaissance emphasis on progress<br>although Taylor is firm on the<br>uniqueness of Christ<br>he is willing to be imaginative and to<br>take risks to see that worked out<br>he believes that it is within their<br>worlds that Christ will challenge<br>transform and revolutionize them<br>so he writes<br>either we must think of Christian<br>Mission in terms of bringing the Muslim<br>Hindu the animist into Christendom<br>or we must go with Christ as he stands<br>in the midst of Islam of Hinduism of the<br>primal worldview<br>and watch with him<br>fearfully and wonderfully as he becomes<br>dare we say it Muslim or Hindu or<br>animist as once he became man and a Jew<br>once led by the spirit the church made<br>its choice in this matter at the Council<br>of Jerusalem<br>a dared to win Gentiles by becoming<br>Gentile<br>so Christ and his church answered the<br>call of the Greeks he came where they<br>were and became what they were<br>from within their own culture he<br>challenged their strengths and judged<br>their wisdom<br>he turned their world upside down just<br>as he had turned Judaism upside down<br>just as indeed if he enters our churches<br>today<br>he turns our Christianity upside down<br>so would he Challenge and judge and<br>revolutionize the African worldview<br>another powerful and dangerous story<br>that he narrated was of a young Anglican<br>Monk and an ashram which she shared with<br>his Buddhist friends<br>on the walls of the chapel are works by<br>Rodan<br>the French sculptor Rodan the figure of<br>Shiva and one of Buddha and meditation<br>nearer the front of the chapel of<br>Michelangelo's Moses another Old<br>Testament character and pictures of the<br>Christ<br>Taylor Ponders<br>is this truth or compromise<br>and is the Christian priest right to<br>include in the Preparatory part of his<br>communion service<br>a reading from the Buddhist texts<br>such are the hard questions that face us<br>there here and everywhere<br>as we struggle to communicate the gospel<br>in context<br>just as Jacob wrestled with the angel so<br>we too need to wrestle with theological<br>questions and issues that arise as we<br>engage in Mission<br>it is a serious undertaking<br>it's a long undertaking<br>with no certain outcome<br>we need to experience experiment we will<br>make mistakes<br>but it's absolutely necessary if we are<br>to develop a missional theology that is<br>fit for purpose to be of service to the<br>all theology which is earnest is also<br>dangerous<br>it's an act of adoration fraught with<br>so imagine Mission as joining in with<br>God<br>as I said at the start John Taylor is<br>probably best known these days for the<br>succinct and popular summary of mission<br>when did Jesus start his mission<br>the First Act of verbs used of Jesus are<br>when he was in the temple to Beijing<br>with the teachers<br>and we're told that he was listening<br>and asking them questions<br>so listening and asking questions are a<br>vital part of engaging in Mission<br>and of our theological reflection on<br>Mission<br>so in the series of lectures I hope we<br>have been on a journey of imagination<br>we have seen lament Hospitality<br>salvation race and Empire as all part of<br>what it means to engage in mission in<br>our world today<br>along with Taylor we believe that we<br>need to be imaginative to be humble and<br>gentle in our Witness<br>take risks<br>to encourage the local to flourish<br>to be at the edges to travel light<br>to practice picnicity to acknowledge<br>that mission can be dangerous and will<br>cost everything<br>and to discern the presence of the<br>spirit of God already at work<br>imagine mission is trying to make the<br>world a better place<br>imagine if Mission were as simple and<br>complex as that<br>essentially mission is the Redemption<br>and healing of all things under Christ<br>it's a yearning to see all things<br>renewed our relationships our societies<br>our environment our world and our Cosmos<br>Mission means joining him as he joins<br>the father in The unfinished task of<br>creation Redemption and Perfection of<br>the whole universe<br>so allow me to conclude with a CMS<br>prayer<br>our journey together has shown us that<br>the father is revealed Christ made known<br>and the spirit encountered when<br>good news is proclaimed<br>hospitality is given and received<br>strangers are welcome<br>boundaries are crossed<br>lives are lived simply<br>stories are told<br>creation is valued<br>Society is transformed<br>Grace is realized<br>Community is lived<br>God is honored<br>amen<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
