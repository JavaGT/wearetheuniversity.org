you can comment on the post that<br>is on the theology Facebook page and the<br>link is up there on the on the screen<br>for you<br>so Kathy thank you for coming we welcome<br>you here with us today<br>thank you<br>kyotata<br>Katarina<br>called<br>good to be with you<br>nice trip to speak a little bit of Maori<br>and thank you very much for inviting me<br>to give this series of lectures<br>so as Lynn said six lectures around the<br>theme of another world as possible<br>so tonight we're going to be looking at<br>lament and then tomorrow in hospitality<br>and then thinking about salvation<br>salvation<br>and then next week we'll be looking at<br>whiteness and racial Justice Empire and<br>then finishing with a kind of summing up<br>of this Mission as an adventure of the<br>imagination<br>um<br>it's really good to be at the University<br>of otago and I discovered just last week<br>that the academic administrator on our<br>team at CMS<br>is related to Robbie Burns so that was<br>interesting I thought that'll give me<br>some street cred if you had to say that<br>so<br>um let's get started so another world is<br>there are things that can be seen only<br>with eyes that have cried<br>so I wonder if this is a familiar<br>sentiment for some of us<br>particularly for us kiwis whether at<br>home or overseas<br>in recent months with the cyclone and<br>the rain and all the climate disasters<br>the pandemic as well as the terrorist<br>attack on the mosque in Christchurch a<br>few years ago<br>and for us from afar we have felt the<br>pain and anxiety for loved ones<br>and for the land itself<br>and I know that for those of you who<br>live here this must be much more<br>immediate and tense and perhaps even<br>visceral<br>it's tough to see the people you love<br>and the land you love suffering such<br>Devastation and disaster and all of this<br>after the covert pandemic various<br>lockdowns ongoing mental health issues<br>the war in Ukraine economic Fallout<br>what's going on in Sudan at the moment<br>climate disasters<br>and also for us those of you who live<br>here and even for expatriate Huey's<br>exploring our own Colonial history<br>and wondering just what just<br>co-governance might look like<br>so how then do we face our current and<br>Global context and where do we find Hope<br>so I think it's important to remember<br>that others have been there before us<br>and have experienced various kinds of<br>trauma as well and others before us have<br>found Hope<br>North American writer and chronicler<br>Rebecca sonnet writes powerfully about<br>hope when she wrote about the Hurricane<br>Katrina in New Orleans she found Grounds<br>for Hope and the altruism<br>that she saw at work in the world as<br>well as in our response to disaster<br>she believes that authorities think that<br>our response to disaster will be to<br>behave badly and that our brutish nature<br>will emerge<br>however she observed that in most<br>disasters the majority of people are<br>calm resourceful altruistic and creative<br>incidentally this is also a thesis put<br>forward by a young Dutch journalist<br>ruchia bregman in his recent book<br>humankind a hopeful history where he<br>believes that we are better than we<br>think we are<br>and she explores various scenarios to<br>illustrate but so I just read this<br>recently it's an interesting take for<br>the son of a Dutch reformed pastor<br>so sonnet believes that a disaster can<br>open up another possible world<br>and she writes thus a disaster is a lot<br>like a revolution when it comes to<br>disruption and improvisation to new<br>roles in an unnerving or exhilarating<br>sense that now anything is possible<br>so as I read these words it made me<br>wonder can we then dare to Hope Indian<br>novelist arendashi Roy writing about the<br>pandemic considers it as a portal a<br>Gateway between this world and the next<br>and she urged us not to return to<br>normality but to re-imagine our world<br>Anew so that we can walk through lightly<br>with little luggage ready to imagine<br>another world<br>and ready to fight for it so like sonnet<br>she sees hope and the possibilities for<br>newness and change but that this will<br>not come about automatically we must be<br>prepared to struggle for it<br>so I wonder how we feel about that a<br>couple of years later is where<br>in theory and post-pandemic times<br>Old Testament scholar Walter Bruggeman<br>picks up a similar theme by recalling<br>the importance of memory he says memory<br>produces hope in the same way that<br>Amnesia produces despair<br>he reminds us that our hope is grounded<br>in memory and that our consumer culture<br>is actually organized against history he<br>says there's a depreciation of memory<br>and a ridicule of Hope which means<br>everything must be held in the now<br>either an urgent now or an eternal now<br>being immersed in our present consumer<br>culture then deadens any expectations<br>that we can reshape the future<br>sonnet explains that our memories can<br>give us hope for the new as we remember<br>the good things that we fought to change<br>in the past to bring about the news such<br>as the end of slavery universal suffrage<br>and living wage<br>Bruggeman Advocates the idea of Change<br>by the use of the term disruptive<br>so he explains<br>he says I think we think in terms of<br>systems and continuities and<br>predictability and schemes and plans<br>I think the Bible is to some great<br>extent focused on God's capacity to<br>break those schemes open and to violate<br>those formula<br>when their positive disruptions the<br>Bible calls the Miracles<br>we tend not to use that word when they<br>are negative<br>but what it means is that the reality of<br>our life and the reality of God are not<br>contained in most of our explanatory<br>schemes<br>and to understand this he draws on the<br>biblical language of lament to help us<br>to name and face these crises or<br>negative disruptions and then to find<br>Hope<br>as we name and face our situation mourn<br>and grieve the current realities sit<br>with them and not rush on<br>then we can begin tentatively to find<br>Hope<br>another scholar that has written<br>powerfully on the themes of lament and<br>hope is Ugandan Roman Catholic scholar<br>Emmanuel katangoli and his book born<br>from lament the physiology and politics<br>of Hope in Africa<br>this is a book that looks squarely at<br>the truly terrible evil cruel violence<br>and tragic suffering in Congo<br>and he reflects on how and why this has<br>happened<br>he details the trauma<br>and the depth of loss experienced the<br>loss of community<br>the loss of humanity and more tragically<br>the loss of future<br>so I'm sure you know some of the horror<br>and suffering children taken from their<br>Villages and told to kill their<br>relatives<br>he cites the 2011 study that indicated<br>that<br>1152 women were raped every day during<br>that conflict rate of 48 per hour<br>and American studies shows that 12 of<br>all Congolese women have been raped at<br>least once<br>I won't elaborate further the stories<br>are truly chilling<br>and so katangole asks how does one live<br>with this<br>can there be a future and if so what<br>kind and where is God<br>and like Bruggeman he finds the clue to<br>the Future and the power and hope of<br>Lament<br>katangoli believes that in the face of<br>such pain and Trauma<br>the church in Africa and everywhere<br>needs to learn how to lament He suggests<br>that the African church tends to focus<br>on a powerful God<br>God who performs Miracles who has mighty<br>to save and who Reigns Supreme which all<br>of which is true of course<br>so need to know how to lament in the<br>face of suffering trauma and pain<br>the Counterpoint to our almighty God is<br>the crucified God seen in Jesus Christ<br>on the cross he continues to suffer with<br>and Among Us<br>so with karangali's insights and an<br>example from Burundi I would like to<br>consider lament in the following ways<br>which I've grouped as lament as<br>articulation and complaint<br>lament as resistance Justice and<br>innovation<br>and lament as newness and Hope<br>firstly it's in context karangoli<br>reminds us that for Israel their Safety<br>and Security are not found in military<br>might and strength nor in wealth or<br>cyber security<br>but in their Covenant relationship with<br>Yahweh<br>yes the Israelites praised God but they<br>also protested at God they railed<br>against Injustice they pressed God for<br>deliverance<br>we see this especially in the Psalms<br>of the 150 Sons 60 of them are about 40<br>percent are known as Psalms of Lament<br>there are psalms of praise Psalms of<br>Thanksgiving the Royal Psalms but the<br>largest category are the Psalms of<br>Lament<br>meant that the core of Israel's Life<br>Social religious and Community was<br>framed by Lament<br>there's a generally recognized structure<br>to these Psalms of rement with five<br>elements<br>so let's take some 13 as an example<br>how long oh Lord so there's the address<br>or articulation directed to God<br>and then the complaint<br>which describes the problem will you<br>forget me forever how long will you hide<br>your face from me how long must I bear<br>pain in my soul and have sorrow in my<br>heart all day long<br>how long shall my enemy be exalted over<br>me<br>and then the request which asks for a<br>specific response from God consider and<br>answer me or Lord my God give light to<br>my eyes or I will sleep the sleep of<br>death<br>the motivation that articulates the<br>and my enemy will say I have prevailed<br>my foes Will Rejoice because I am shaken<br>but I trusted in your steadfast love<br>my heart shall rejoice in your salvation<br>finishing with confidence I will sing to<br>because he has dealt bountifully with me<br>so these elements of articulation<br>complaint request motivation and<br>confidence do vary as they're not found<br>in all sounds of lament but they do<br>signify a kind of turning to God which<br>reflects I think a deep intimacy of God<br>with<br>a relationship of trust intimacy and<br>love as a necessary precondition for<br>genuine Lament<br>we're in the biblical writers lament<br>they do so from within the context of a<br>foundational relationship that binds<br>together the individual with members of<br>The Community of Faith and that<br>Community with their God<br>and category reminds us that biblical<br>lament is neither a kind of unrestrained<br>whining at God nor a kind of angry<br>venting but rather it's a structured and<br>complex language of complaint protest<br>and appeal directed to God<br>so this makes it a distinct Faith<br>language with its own vocabulary and<br>grammar for those intimate and difficult<br>conversations with God when we're<br>hurting<br>and another important fast that we<br>notice is that lament often moves into<br>praise<br>the laments and songs of Thanksgiving<br>belong together in Israel's worship<br>they have the confidence to express the<br>entire range of human emotions before<br>God doubt Faith sorrow Joy fear trust<br>Life Death such as the confidence born<br>out of the Covenant relationship and a<br>sign of the depth of their relationship<br>with their loving God<br>after all what kind of relationship is<br>it if we can only express our joy and<br>Faith but not our need our sorrow our<br>so lament as articulation and complaint<br>the first cry in Psalm 13 is how long O<br>Lord<br>and we find a similar sentiment in the<br>book of Lamentations<br>there the first word is Ika<br>these are protestations of Lament<br>Ika is a cry of mourning a kind of<br>primordial and primeval Christ a good<br>voice to deep suffering<br>this ancient cry embodies a whole range<br>of emotions grief despair<br>anguish forgiveness<br>shame hope compassion<br>it's also a cathartic expression<br>how can God treat them like this<br>and in a context of suffering a cry of<br>lament is important physiologically<br>emotionally psychologically spiritually<br>the cries not only express our pain<br>but also encourage us to sit with it<br>we cannot Rush away from this<br>this is a painful and present reality<br>we have to remain with it and all its<br>complaint is a key component of Lament<br>expressions of complaint in the Psalms<br>range from expressions of concern to<br>utter desperation in the face of illness<br>before one's enemies or protestations of<br>Innocence<br>however to complain is risky and perhaps<br>seems almost improper<br>but I think it also shows that the<br>relationship with God is alive Dynamic<br>and open<br>it also refuses to accept things the way<br>they are<br>that protests God's silence and presses<br>God for deliverance<br>this requires courage to protest in this<br>way against God but we see it again and<br>again in the Psalms and in the prophets<br>such as Jeremiah<br>and it may also be a Way Forward into<br>newness<br>and the Psalms of lament while the<br>righteous draw on memories of God saving<br>actions in the past<br>there was always the risk and<br>possibility that God will act in totally<br>new ways as a result of this present<br>present suffering<br>so we may see and learn something<br>totally new and unexpected about God<br>this suggests that Israel understood<br>complaint as an essential part of their<br>Covenant relationship with God<br>cash and goal I believe that it is not<br>those who lack Faith who complain<br>but those recognized for strong faith<br>who bring their most honest and<br>passionate feelings to God<br>it ensures that the relationship is<br>alive Dynamic negotiated contested<br>voicing lament and pain<br>can be a form of resistance<br>to Healing<br>it means that we will not be rendered<br>powerless and voiceless we will not<br>remain Paralyzed by despair<br>and it's also risky because complaint is<br>a former protest it refuses to accept<br>things the way they are it presses God<br>for deliverance it challenges God how<br>long o God why do you hide your faith<br>the psalmists say some outrageous things<br>such as you are the one who has done<br>this remove your Scourge from me I'm<br>overcome by the blow of your hand<br>it challenges God's silence it puts God<br>on the spot<br>and what kind of God remains silent to<br>however perhaps God's silence also<br>allows space for human speech touch and<br>human healing<br>Old Testament scholar Kathleen O'Connor<br>writing on the book of Lamentations<br>notes<br>God's silence and Lamentations leaves<br>wounds festering open to the air and<br>possible to Healing<br>the benefits of exposed wounds is that<br>they become visible and unavoidable<br>lift exposed<br>they require us to see acknowledge and<br>attend to them<br>might The Silence of God also point to a<br>fresh dimension of God right the suggest<br>a mysterious God and ineffable God a<br>vulnerable God who Grieves alongside us<br>and the face of such suffering<br>perhaps these cries of lament reflect<br>God's Own Lamentations<br>The God Who suffers with us<br>Jesus's Incarnation and his Cry of<br>dereliction on the cross my God my God<br>why have you forsaken me testify to this<br>reality<br>the Connor also believes that the<br>Silence of God is inspired and that its<br>haunting power lies in its brutal<br>honesty<br>God's frightening silence is resonant<br>with interpretive possibility<br>it makes the Poetry a Haven for voices<br>of pain<br>it prevents us from sliding prematurely<br>African-American gospel songs the slave<br>spirituals are a powerful expression of<br>their belief that God was with them in<br>their suffering<br>even while they were living in their<br>whirling Vortex of God forsakenness<br>the slay songs are drenched in pain and<br>sadness<br>but they also Express a spirit of<br>resistance confidence and Hope<br>what gave them their confidence was The<br>Exodus story that ultimately God would<br>save or rescue them<br>and also their identification of their<br>own suffering with that of Christ's<br>forsakenness on the cross<br>I'm told that during the apartheid years<br>in South Africa the most popular<br>Services were the Good Friday services<br>because the people could identify with<br>Jesus and his pain suffering and<br>desolation<br>Jesus understood the slaves the<br>oppressed the anguish of apartheid<br>because he too knew misery anguish and<br>forsakenness<br>and this resonance gave them the ability<br>to endure and to Hope<br>and ultimately it was those spirituals<br>that gave birth to the freedom songs of<br>the American Civil Rights Movement<br>Martin Luther King Jr commented the<br>freedom songs<br>are playing a strong and vital role in<br>our struggle<br>they give the people new courage and a<br>sense of unity I think they keep alive<br>of Faith a radiant hope in the future<br>what about us how do we engage with<br>Lament<br>Bruggeman and others have highlighted<br>the absence of lament in our churches<br>Bruggeman connects it with an inability<br>to face suffering and to embrace<br>negativity in our Western world<br>and North American Theologian Glenn<br>Pemberton suggests that the church as a<br>middle class institution has become<br>increasingly embarrassed by the earthy<br>and gritty language of Lament<br>he writes we have chosen to live<br>protected lives in insulated communities<br>whether our community is a middle to<br>upper class neighborhood or a church or<br>the Fortress mentality<br>a lack of solidarity with those in need<br>is what causes us to wonder why these<br>prayers are in the Bible and to question<br>who would ever need them<br>perhaps this is because of our increased<br>prosperity and identification with the<br>mainstream lament sounds dreary and<br>negative to those who do not wish to be<br>reminded either of their own<br>vulnerability and suffering or that of<br>those around them<br>North American biblical scholar Ellen<br>Davis offers us some hard-hitting and<br>challenging insights<br>she suggests that when we read Psalm 109<br>we need to turn it 180 degrees<br>so that it's directed towards us<br>and to ask ourselves<br>is there anyone in the community of<br>God's people who might want to say this<br>to God about me or about us<br>we are active participants in a<br>rapacious industrial economy regularly<br>consuming far more than we need of the<br>world's Goods<br>and she then projects this idea onto our<br>great-grandchildren's generation to say<br>nothing of the present majority world<br>who might cry out and lament to God<br>let their memory be cut off from the<br>earth because they did not remember to<br>act in Covenant faith that hounded a<br>person poor and needy crushed in heart<br>and Bruggeman concludes a Community of<br>Faith which negates Lament<br>soon concludes that the hard issues of<br>Justice<br>improper questions to pose at the throne<br>because the throne seems only to be a<br>place of praise<br>I believe it thus follows that if<br>Justice questions are improper questions<br>at the throne<br>they soon appear to be improper<br>questions in public places and schools<br>and hospitals but the government and<br>eventually even in the courts<br>Justice questions disappear into<br>Civility and disinity<br>a loss of lament can then signify a loss<br>so to sum up lament is a kind of<br>discipline<br>that involves multiple actions crying<br>out remembering keeping silent repenting<br>and praying<br>the public practice of lament is<br>essentially Having the courage to name<br>what is happening<br>to insist on engaging with God in the<br>midst of the tragedy and suffering<br>it is a way of keeping hope alive amidst<br>the despair as well as a way of<br>reminding those of us in relative<br>Comfort to remember the vital importance<br>of lament to bring about Justice and<br>change<br>so moving on to my second section romant<br>lament as resistance Justice and<br>innovation<br>lament can be a form of resistance and<br>can ultimately bring about Justice<br>newness and Hope<br>we've already noted that the<br>African-American slave spirituals are a<br>form of resistance<br>and lament is also a form of agency<br>a cry a cry of English anguish is not<br>only a way of naming and mourning what<br>is lost<br>but also it's a way of standing in the<br>midst of the suffering<br>and so lament deepens our engagement<br>with the world of suffering and invites<br>us into more active social and political<br>engagement<br>so let me give offer you a dramatic<br>example of this by telling you about<br>Maggie baronkite and we'll watch a short<br>video clip in a moment about his story<br>but just as an introduction<br>Maggie is a Tootsie<br>she was caught up in the ethnic<br>massacres in Burundi not Rwanda but in<br>Burundi in 1993.<br>in October 1993 she hid in the local<br>Bishop's residence<br>as soldiers attacked stripped Maggie and<br>tied her to a chair and then massacred<br>72 people including one of her best<br>friends<br>amazingly her seven children all<br>survived the massacre by hiding in the<br>sacristian<br>category narrates her story<br>after the massacre Maggie crawled into<br>the chapel she prayed as she cried<br>my mother taught me you were a god of<br>love<br>she lied to me<br>you are not love<br>God why was I not killed why am I here<br>why oh God<br>as she prayed and cried she heard Chloe<br>the children had escaped by hiding and<br>bribing the militia with money she<br>managed to save another 25 children from<br>burning from the burning building<br>and his night fell she sought Refuge at<br>the house of a German development worker<br>Maggie went on to set up Maison shalom<br>houses for children Farms businesses a<br>swimming pool a cinema a hospital a<br>nursing school a microcredit Finance<br>Union and even a university so we just<br>kind of watched a short clip now of<br>she calls it Maison shalom it's here in<br>the burundian village of ruigi that<br>Maggie baronkitsi has transformed the<br>lives of thirty thousand orphans Maggie<br>has rejected burundi's past of ethnic<br>hatred poverty and genocide instead<br>she's writing a news story she's created<br>a place where children can be raised in<br>a vision of love and God's abundance<br>Maison Shalom now includes a farm<br>Hospital<br>movie theater<br>swimming pool a mechanic shop among<br>other businesses<br>we Christian<br>our duty<br>it's not<br>to to to go every day in the church and<br>praying and then it's to to give back<br>the dignity to the human person because<br>all the projects<br>is surrounding this human person<br>yes we can give clothes we can feed the<br>person who can<br>it's nothing<br>it began at the start of burundi's civil<br>war Maggie and ethnic Tutsi was working<br>as a secretary at the Catholic Bishop's<br>house in ruigi she had adopted seven<br>children four hutus and three Tutsis in<br>October 1993 Tutsi assailants attacked<br>the compound Maggie was stripped naked<br>and tied up 72 hutus were killed before<br>her eyes including priests and nuns one<br>was her best friend Juliet<br>look at me and said please<br>educated my children didn't reject like<br>your own children<br>give them the love<br>but I prefer to die with my husband and<br>then they cut<br>and they give me<br>Maggie's seven adopted children survived<br>and she managed to save another 25<br>children as well but she didn't stop<br>there this horrific experience was the<br>start of Maggie's calling not just to<br>save children but to proclaim the gospel<br>message of Love by raising a new<br>generation without the hatred and<br>bitterness she already saw growing in<br>their eyes every day<br>I improvised new life because love<br>makers inventor Emmanuel kotongole as a<br>Catholic priest and professor at Duke<br>Community School<br>he's the author of the sacrifice of<br>Africa a book about Christian leaders in<br>Africa including Maggie Maggie says love<br>has made me an inventor<br>but in order to understand what she says<br>and what she means by love has made me<br>an inventor you need to go back a little<br>discover that for Maggie love is our<br>true identity<br>she is in a way entering into that story<br>of love<br>and kind of allowing that story to if<br>you like explored from within in order<br>to show what it means that's that's what<br>she says love has made me an inventor<br>kind of living within that story of love<br>in a way allows me to invent a new<br>future<br>being an inventor is about inventing a<br>new future of being God's beloved but<br>Maggie's calling was to do more than<br>just protect children<br>18 years after that terrible day Maison<br>Shalom is thriving with Maggie as the<br>Visionary Catalyst Maison Shalom is<br>building an enduring and sustainable<br>institution Nissan Shalom challenges the<br>notion that Burundi is a poor country it<br>challenges the idea that burundi's 600<br>000 orphans cannot Thrive they hatred<br>and ethnic divisions must continue it's<br>so stupid to hurt the others because<br>they are different than us because it's<br>Harmony<br>to see who too and Tutti together<br>Congolese other white people God wants<br>to make it's so beautiful to see those<br>difference it became richness<br>Maggie insists that the people of<br>Burundi can live full Rich lives this<br>includes entertainment such as watching<br>movies and swimming Wendy you want to<br>make is<br>where is a war and they will destroy<br>everything and why a cinema and the<br>swimming pool and they said I said why<br>you must always give us clothes and so<br>we can dream like you Nissan Shalom now<br>comprises many businesses including a<br>mechanic school a tailor shop and a hair<br>salon you see to dream also not only to<br>you can sit and they work at your all<br>are part of the vision<br>the Enterprises generate income and make<br>Maison Shalom sustainable but they also<br>carry a powerful theological message the<br>swimming pool isn't just a place for the<br>children to have fun it's a symbol of<br>the Waters of baptism built on a killing<br>field and then where I have found many<br>bodies because I am Christian I said I<br>will put a swimming pool<br>because of the watch of our baptize<br>clean all the sin Shalom also includes a<br>morgue in a nation where killing has<br>become routine families now have a place<br>to honor their dead<br>for this dignity I must give up<br>opportunity to<br>there's an area for celebrating and<br>feasting<br>in the midst of so Much Death this space<br>speaks to the hope of Resurrection<br>we never die really because we go our<br>mission on here is finished we continue<br>another because we are created for<br>eternity Maggie is sharing her vision<br>Beyond ruigi and even Burundi Mason<br>Shalom is a demonstration plot of hope<br>her work has been recognized with the<br>Opus prize a faith-based humanitarian<br>award for social Innovation Maggie wants<br>to uh ferment if you like a revolution<br>caused a Revolution of Love<br>and so it's quite ambitious she wants an<br>to the whole world evolution of love my<br>dream<br>is to build all over the world<br>Mouse to say we are only one family<br>and it's my dream like John Lennon in<br>under Maggie's leadership Maison Shalom<br>has become a place of hope joy and a new<br>community<br>so there are some important things to<br>note about Maggie in the context of<br>Lament<br>after the massacre she experienced an<br>incredible energy determination and<br>anger all of which she turned to setting<br>up Maison Shalom but the key driver for<br>her was love<br>she operates out of an excess of Love<br>which was a basic theological principle<br>for her she said love made me an<br>inventor<br>I love that phrase love made me an<br>inventor<br>it was a love that caused her to<br>innovate<br>so in the face of all this trauma she<br>improvised and innovated so the children<br>could survive but not only survive<br>flourish she invented a new community<br>not only Tootsie or Hutu but a community<br>Beyond tribalism<br>she came up with very practical ideas as<br>you saw the Workshops the salon the<br>cinema the hospital and even a swimming<br>pool her love was deepened through her<br>grief and Lament<br>there is something about pain and<br>suffering<br>at the heart of love<br>there are things that can be seen only<br>with eyes that have cried<br>said Archbishop Christopher the Roman<br>Catholic Archbishop of bukavi<br>in the midst of the Civil War in eastern<br>Congo he worked for peace<br>to build structures of Justice<br>forgiveness and love<br>he experienced the war the ethnic<br>violence the refugee crisis the<br>destruction of bukavu he was a prophet<br>for a new vision of society but after<br>two years as Archbishop he was<br>assassinated he was shot dead at a<br>checkpoint<br>there are things that can be seen only<br>with eyes that have cried<br>out of the pain and intense suffering<br>and anger Maggie Found the courage to<br>take risks and to innovate<br>she was determined that death and evil<br>would never have the last word because<br>she innovated something new<br>which offered newness and hope and<br>because love wins<br>and it's vital to remember that because<br>it's vital to remember that love wins<br>because I have<br>a sad PS about Maggie's story so in 2015<br>the president of Burundi president<br>Pierre and coronziza decided to run for<br>a third term<br>this plunged the economy in the whole<br>country into crisis thousands fled<br>hundreds were arrested many were killed<br>Maggie spoke out against the third term<br>she was targeted and she fled into Exile<br>where she still is living and working in<br>Rwanda<br>the government shut down all the Maison<br>Shalom programs in Burundi including the<br>school the schools the hospital and<br>Luigi they closed the bank accounts They<br>confiscated the assets and they even<br>killed some of the children<br>these events have obviously deepened<br>Maggie's Lament<br>this was not<br>a happy ending this is not a happily<br>Ever After Story<br>and yet somehow that makes Maggie's<br>story even more real and more poignant<br>we do what we can with the resources we<br>have through the inspiration of God's<br>spirit<br>and relieve the rest to God<br>but her story is not over she fled to<br>Rwanda where she now lives in Exile and<br>she started all over again and has<br>established Maison shalom there a<br>vocational training center for burundian<br>refugees in Rwanda<br>and category draws some intriguing<br>lessons from Maggie's story<br>which may even be pertinent for us here<br>in aotearoa and a host disaster context<br>with all the client recent climate<br>disasters<br>we've already noticed that she was<br>driven by love and compassion<br>she claims that love is our true<br>identity that love is the most beautiful<br>calling of human beings we are created<br>out of love and to love she says<br>asserts that her efforts to invent a new<br>community Beyond tribalism are a form of<br>Madness<br>and that to be a Christian is to be<br>invited into a drama of Madness<br>indeed Maggie herself reminds us that<br>the first crazy man was Jesus and she<br>challenges us to be crazy for love<br>in Burundi the majority of children that<br>Maggie has welcomed into Maison Shalom<br>are orphans Street children and former<br>Child soldiers<br>and this reflects a profound theological<br>belief that God's love is for all<br>but especially for the poor the<br>vulnerable and the weak<br>category affirms if God's love invents a<br>new social reality in history<br>that reality begins not in the centers<br>of power but at the margins of society<br>with overlooked and wounded individuals<br>and situations of suffering and disaster<br>It's usually the poorer and more<br>vulnerable vulnerable communities that<br>suffer the most<br>what kind of inventiveness or innovation<br>might love drive us towards<br>what might that mean for arterio New<br>Zealand as the country faces issues of<br>climate change and where to rebuild<br>after the recent climate disasters<br>or what might that mean as we<br>investigate our own Colonial history and<br>work towards forms of just co-governance<br>Maggie's grief over her situation turned<br>her into an inventor which she expressed<br>through resistance love and innovation<br>we may experience similar feelings and<br>reactions when we think about the future<br>of our planet<br>and a recent book on eco anxiety<br>Anglican priest Reverend Francis Ward<br>writes about the Deep foreboding she<br>experiences about the future of our<br>planet<br>and reverentless horse spirituality<br>lecturer at wickriff Hall and Oxford<br>writes<br>I am crying as I write this because I am<br>sad so very sad at the loss of beauty<br>and Variety in this world<br>we are experiencing climate grief<br>eco-anxiety<br>Soul Nostalgia which means homesickness<br>in a Dying World<br>or what Finnish Theologian panu picana<br>names as difficult feelings because of<br>the ecological crisis<br>there's a small but growing body of work<br>that is beginning to name this deep<br>lament and fear that we experience as we<br>grieve for our planet<br>young English Theologian Hannah Malcolm<br>won the 2019 theology slam prize in<br>England with her lecture entitled<br>climate chaos and Collective grief<br>she explores some of the complexities of<br>this<br>from The Temptations to romanticize<br>Mother Nature to flatten the differences<br>between humans and other creatures or to<br>demonize all human activity<br>however she reminds us that we grieve<br>the death of particular things<br>or to put it another way if grief is an<br>expression of love<br>our grief takes on the shape of the<br>places and creatures to whom we<br>intimately belong<br>her book is a series of stories of grief<br>and lament from different contexts<br>around the world describing the Beloved<br>things we have lost<br>so naming the grief and taking time to<br>lament can then lead us to Hope<br>Innovation and action as it did for<br>Maggie<br>Ward writes to reach that Fierce hope a<br>need to Lament<br>to allow that ancient practice to find<br>expression and turn the debilitating<br>we do need resources to fuel this and to<br>be able to live without despair<br>we can find Hope in taking action and in<br>reimagining how to live on our planet<br>over 50 years ago the church Mission<br>Society General Secretary and later<br>Bishop of Winchester John Taylor wrote<br>about a Theology of enough<br>this was 50 years ago<br>he believed that the concept of enough<br>is a theme woven throughout the<br>scriptures<br>for example the laws of first fruits and<br>limited cropping or the idea of Jubilee<br>more recently University of Oxford<br>Economist Kate raworth brilliantly<br>reimagined economics for the 21st<br>century with her theory of donut<br>economics<br>which aims to ensure that no one is left<br>without and that has an ecological<br>ceiling so that the planet is not over<br>exploited<br>she claims that we must reject economies<br>that concentrate resources in the hands<br>of fewer and fewer people and that we<br>should design a kind of distributive<br>economics<br>and she's designed a model in which the<br>goal is human thriving as well as<br>safeguarding the planet's life systems<br>and providing for all people's needs<br>and her approach everyone could live<br>above the poverty line partly because we<br>would reject greed and excess and be<br>content with enough<br>now I'm not an economist but I found<br>this intriguing and I think this is the<br>kind of innovative thinking that is<br>and then finally lament as newness and<br>Hope<br>as with Maggie lament can lead to Hope<br>and innovation<br>Malcolm writes to lament we must name<br>the damage<br>Express grief act out restitution and so<br>access restoring forgiveness<br>hope like lament becomes a way of being<br>in the world<br>Eco psychologist Michael apathy asserts<br>that in order to deal with the climate<br>crisis effectively we need to do our own<br>inner and spirit our own inner spiritual<br>and psychological work as well as the<br>outer work of activism<br>and making real systemic changes in our<br>world<br>like Maggie we need to innovate for<br>climate Justice and change<br>it's important to connect with others<br>and Community to do this together and to<br>draw on organizations like arosha or<br>Extinction Rebellion climate Justice<br>satira forest and bird to help us bring<br>about change and to find Hope<br>former Archbishop Rowan Williams writes<br>powerfully on Hope<br>he writes hope is a condition Here and<br>Now<br>not a foretelling of what lies ahead and<br>certainly not an inoculation against<br>loss<br>but the affirmation that God is bound to<br>the finite reality that God loves<br>and it's God's business to honor that<br>binding<br>meanwhile we keep ourselves open to The<br>God Who acts and speaks in the present<br>and we labor at whatever we can do to<br>prevent catastrophe even if we are<br>fearful that all our effort is too late<br>we still celebrate the swallow in the<br>moment<br>anticipating loss can be a way of<br>slipping away from a gift that is here<br>and now<br>without the celebration now<br>the loss would actually be softened in a<br>strange way<br>the risk of loss gives the joy a kind of<br>fierceness<br>we have already noted that lament can<br>have a surprising turn to praise<br>however lament and praise are not simply<br>juxtaposed<br>rather there can be an unexpected<br>movement which brings about a fresh<br>perspective and new language<br>so this possibility of lament turning<br>into praise reflects the transformation<br>and Innovation a novelty that is only<br>possible with the articulation of both<br>pain and belief<br>the procola mint has the potential to<br>bring us to a new place to a new depth<br>to a new song of Praise which is<br>qualitatively different from the praise<br>that has gone before<br>it is a new kind of depth of knowledge<br>and experience only made possible by the<br>experience of the suffering the pain and<br>the mint<br>it's a new kind of seeing<br>a kind of seeing emerging from the pain<br>suffering and anguish<br>there are things that can be seen only<br>with eyes that have cried<br>this is an important Insight that there<br>is newness and hope after the pain<br>but it will be different<br>and we will arrive there only because of<br>perhaps Pope francis's metaphor of the<br>church as field Hospital might be<br>appropriate here<br>repairing the Brokenness and healing the<br>wounds<br>not that we are the sole actors in This<br>regard but we could offer a theological<br>grammar of Hope<br>by standing alongside those who are<br>suffering by being with rather than<br>doing four or two we participate in the<br>mystery of God's Own suffering death and<br>Resurrection<br>it is this participation that<br>mysteriously releases hope<br>and katangole claims that the African<br>church is in fact a unique gift to World<br>Christianity as a laboratory of Hope<br>which provides a living witness of what<br>hope looks like in the context of<br>violence and War<br>are we able in our own context to be a<br>field hospital or perhaps a field<br>Nursery or garden that heals and binds<br>the wounds<br>stands in solidarity with The Afflicted<br>and traumatized challenges and Justice<br>and innovates<br>to offer hope and to bring about newness<br>so let me just conclude now with a poem<br>by Denise levitov<br>but we have only begun to love the Earth<br>we have only begun to imagine the<br>fullness of life<br>how could retire of Hope<br>so much is in but<br>how can desire fail we have only begun<br>to imagine Justice and mercy only begun<br>to Envision how it might be to live as<br>siblings with Beast and flower not as<br>oppressors<br>surely our River cannot already be<br>hastening into the sea of non-being<br>surely it cannot drag in the silt all<br>that is innocent<br>not yet not yet<br>there is too much broken that must be<br>mended<br>too much hurt that we have done to each<br>other that cannot yet be forgiven<br>we have only begun to know the power<br>that is in us if we would join our<br>solitudes in the communion of struggle<br>so much is unfolding that must complete<br>its gesture<br>thank you<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
