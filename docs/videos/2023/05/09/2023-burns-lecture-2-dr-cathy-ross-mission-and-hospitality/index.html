anybody who's joining us for the<br>first time tonight<br>Kathy works for CNS based in Oxford in<br>the UK<br>where she is the head of pioneer<br>leadership training<br>she also lectures at Regents Park<br>College in Oxford and Kathy is a leading<br>messiologist well known for her work<br>internationally<br>some of the work relating to New Zealand<br>research that interests me particularly<br>in I imagine might interest others is<br>her work on<br>the wives of missionaries the woman<br>workers in in the missionary era in New<br>Zealand society and she's written a book<br>on that it was a result of her PhD work<br>and one that I haven't read but I'm Keen<br>to do so it's an intriguing topic<br>last night Kathy spoke to us on the<br>topic of mission lament and Hope in<br>which she spoke of the way that mission<br>must engage deeply in the pain and<br>suffering of human life<br>proceed into the dark valleys and<br>Justice and so far insofar as it finds<br>Christ there then it will have something<br>also to say about Christian hope<br>tonight the topic is equally intriguing<br>Mission and hospitality<br>I should welcome also those who are<br>viewing online through the live stream<br>and if you'd like to contribute to<br>questions later on please go to the<br>theology program Facebook page you'll<br>find a post there where you can enter<br>your questions into the<br>chat box there so those will be<br>monitored and will endeavor to put those<br>to keep<br>Kathy welcome again and thank you for<br>joining us and we look forward to your<br>next<br>security good evening everybody thank<br>you for coming out again this evening<br>and as Mario said today's tonight's<br>topic is on hospitality<br>so the overall theme is another world as<br>possible and tonight it's about Mission<br>and Hospitality another world is<br>welcoming<br>Mission and Hospitality creating space<br>for one another<br>so ever since we left aotearo and New<br>Zealand to train in Theology and Mission<br>with New Zealand CMS New Zealand Church<br>Mission Society in 1985.<br>I have been interested in Hospitality as<br>a concept and a practice<br>it's practiced and lived out in so many<br>different ways around the world it's<br>usually related to food and drink<br>although not always and it is a practice<br>very dependent on culture context and<br>resources for example an artiero New<br>Zealand we may be comfortable with<br>inviting people into our homes to share<br>a meal together as normally we have the<br>space and the resources to do so<br>in Uganda however you do not normally<br>invite people over instead you drop in<br>on other people<br>this is how you honor the host and<br>there's all<br>these or available<br>for some Hospitality may indeed mean<br>invitation warmth sharing of food<br>relationship<br>for others that may mean ongoing stress<br>and virtual impoverishment as<br>hospitality is demanded and expected<br>sometimes beyond the resources available<br>so I think we can begin to see already<br>that hospitality is a complex metaphor<br>that needs deeper exploration<br>and I wonder if the covid-19 pandemic<br>has helped us to appreciate even more<br>the importance of hospitality as we have<br>experienced the loneliness of isolation<br>and separation from loved ones and<br>Friends<br>English theologians Sam Wells makes a<br>compelling argument<br>that the most important word of theology<br>is a simple small four-letter word<br>beginning with w which is with<br>he argues that our fundamental human<br>problem is isolation<br>and that there is no value in existence<br>unless it is existence in relationship<br>with God with one another and with the<br>creation<br>and he illustrates this quite powerfully<br>I think with<br>a story from the 1992 novel The English<br>Patient<br>I don't know if you remember that novel<br>or if you saw the movie where to cut a<br>long story short the two lovers<br>Catherine and Laszlo end up in a<br>terrible predicament<br>Catherine has suffered life-threatening<br>injuries and help as a dangerous<br>three-day walk away to Cairo<br>with no guarantee that help is even<br>available<br>do<br>Laszlo barely hesitates before taking<br>off to Cairo by the time he returns<br>ethereum is<br>what was the hospitable thing to do<br>well Sam Wells claims that he overlooks<br>the one thing needful Laszlo overlooked<br>the one thing needful which is to be<br>with Catherine<br>Benedictine monk Christopher Jamison<br>also has an interesting take on<br>loneliness and his explanation of the<br>four<br>which he believes results in our<br>isolation<br>he frames it around mistrust<br>Adam does not trust his naked self and<br>then is afraid that God is not<br>trustworthy either and finally he no<br>longer trusts Eve<br>mistrust of self God and others is of a<br>peace<br>he says this as original sin the<br>inability to trust combined with the<br>increasing isolation that mistrust<br>breathes<br>we no longer trust the goodness of God<br>in God's world we turn in on ourselves<br>and isolate ourselves from one another<br>so I believe that the practice of<br>hospitality can be an anti-digenous<br>so tonight I'd like to reflect on how<br>hospitality is an excellent metaphor for<br>Mission as it begins with God and is<br>essentially an outward looking practice<br>and virtue<br>or consider the biblical concept of<br>hospitality and the role of host and<br>guest or stranger and I then consider<br>the gift of sight the role of<br>nourishment Hospitality from or at the<br>edges and finally Hospitality as<br>creating space and a welcoming way of<br>life<br>so Hospitality of welcome<br>fatality is indeed a rich concept full<br>of potential and part of a rich biblical<br>and Christian tradition echoing down<br>Through the Ages<br>most of the ancient world regarded<br>Hospitality as a fundamental virtue and<br>practice as do many cultures still in<br>our world today<br>perhaps in the west we've tended to<br>water it down or commercialize it into<br>an industry with training courses<br>certificates five-star ratings and meet<br>and greet attitudes<br>it's also become a contested idea as we<br>Face ambivalence towards engaging with<br>the other<br>fear of the of The Stranger<br>more recently few of the stranger has<br>become exacerbated with the fear of<br>migrants being shamelessly promoted by<br>the media especially in the UK I'm not<br>so sure about here but particularly in<br>Britain and dehumanizing language used<br>by politicians such as David Cameron's<br>Infamous phrase swarm of migrants news<br>back in 2015.<br>Britain has become notorious for its<br>reluctance to accept let alone welcome<br>migrants<br>and I guess archero New Zealand<br>experienced a kind of Fortress mentality<br>during the covert pandemic<br>while these actions may be politically<br>expedient and some might say necessary<br>they're a long way indeed from being<br>either welcoming or hospitable<br>Israel experienced God as a god of<br>hospitality<br>stories of hospitality are foundational<br>to their very existence and and identity<br>these stories of hospitality contain<br>themes and and tensions which resonate<br>through the centuries stories of<br>hospitality received and Hospitality<br>abused<br>the well-known story of Abraham and<br>Sarah welcoming three strangers brought<br>them good news and bad in the context of<br>hospitality<br>the guests confirmed that they would<br>have a son in their old age but they<br>also warned Abraham of the impending<br>destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah<br>however North American Theologian<br>Christine Paul remarks in her superb<br>book on hospitality<br>and see it there she says the first<br>formative story of the biblical<br>tradition on hospitality is<br>unambiguously positive about welcoming<br>strangers<br>it's a very etymology of the word<br>hospitality<br>Illuminating and Latin the word that<br>signifies host is hospace<br>and the word for enemy is hostas from<br>which we derive hostile<br>however the derivation from the Greek<br>offers us something slightly different<br>there's an interesting and intriguing<br>conundrum around the Greek word xenos<br>which denotes simultaneously guest host<br>or stranger<br>the Greek word for Hospitality in the<br>New Testament philosenia refers not so<br>much to love of strangers but to a<br>delight in the whole guest host<br>relationship and in the surprises that<br>may occur<br>Jesus is portrayed as a gracious host<br>welcoming children Tax Collectors<br>prostitutes and sinners into his<br>presence<br>and therefore offending those who would<br>prefer such gifts not to be at his<br>gatherings<br>but Jesus is also portrayed as<br>vulnerable guest and needy stranger who<br>came to his own but his own did not<br>receive him<br>So Christine Paul comments that this<br>interming of guests and host rules and<br>the person of Jesus is part of what<br>makes the story of hospitality so<br>compelling for Christians<br>think of Jesus on the Emmaus Road as<br>traveling Pilgrim and stranger<br>recognized as host and who he was and<br>the breaking of bread during a meal<br>involving an act of hospitality or think<br>of Peter and Cornelius again another<br>story involving food<br>who's the host and who is the gift<br>both offer and receive both listen and<br>learn both are challenged and changed by<br>the hospitality Hospitality of the other<br>so we can see the importance of not only<br>the ambiguity but also the fluidity of<br>the host guest conundrum<br>we offer and receive as both guest or<br>stranger and host<br>in fact strangers may actually enhance<br>our well-being rather than diminish it<br>the three major festivals of the<br>Christian church<br>Christmas Easter and Pentecost all have<br>to do with the Advent of a Divine<br>stranger<br>in each case The Stranger a baby a<br>resurrected Christ in the Wind of the<br>Holy Spirit<br>all meet us as mysterious or strange<br>visitors<br>breaking into our world challenging Our<br>World Views and systems and welcoming us<br>to new worlds<br>Quaker scholar and educationalist Parker<br>Palmer reminds us in his intriguing book<br>the company of strangers Christians and<br>the renewal of America's public life<br>he reminds us of the importance of the<br>stranger<br>our spiritual pilgrimage is a quest a<br>venture into the unknown away from<br>Safety and Security into strange places<br>for if we remain where we are then<br>really we have no need of faith<br>the visitors to Abraham and Sarah The<br>Stranger On The Emmaus Road brought new<br>truths into their lives<br>according to Palmer we need the stranger<br>in his view the stranger is not simply<br>the one who needs us we need the<br>stranger we need the stranger if we are<br>to know Christ and serve God and truth<br>and in love<br>for him hospitality is inviting The<br>Stranger into our private space<br>whether that be the space of our own<br>home or the space of our personal<br>awareness and concern<br>and when we do so some important<br>Transformations occur<br>our private space is suddenly enlarged<br>no longer tight cramped restricted but<br>open expansive and free<br>and just face may also be illumined<br>Hospitality to the stranger gives us the<br>chance to see our own lives afresh<br>through different eyes<br>so the stranger the other becomes a<br>person of promise<br>stranger may be unsettling the strange<br>May challenge or provoke us<br>stranger can provide a wider perspective<br>and remember the injunction from the<br>book of Hebrews keep on loving each<br>other as brothers and sisters do not<br>forget to entertain strangers<br>for by doing so some people have<br>entertained angels without knowing it<br>strangers save us from cozy domestic<br>domesticated hospitality and force us<br>out of our<br>strangers can trans<br>and challenge us<br>and Palmer goes on to consider the<br>invitation of people into our private<br>space probably our home<br>for most of us our home is the place and<br>space that we<br>have for hospitality<br>and for a private culture this may be a<br>challenge to open up our home and to<br>offer it as a shared space<br>yes there is risk involved but when<br>Hospitality happens God is encountered<br>in a new way<br>Hospitality questions one's way of<br>thinking about oneself and the other as<br>belonging to different spheres<br>it breaks down categories that isolate<br>Hospitality involves a new way of<br>thinking without the presumption of<br>knowing beforehand<br>or is in the mind of the other<br>dialogue or conversation with the other<br>is essential<br>to welcome the other means the<br>willingness to enter into the world of<br>the other<br>so hospitality is transformational now<br>it may also be deeply counter-cultural<br>in our current context<br>the practice of hospitality can<br>encourage us to overcome our fears by<br>offering a welcome resisting isolation<br>and getting to know one another<br>to love our neighbor<br>to enter into the presence of another<br>human being<br>is to enter into the presence of God<br>in Genesis we are reminded that all<br>human beings are created in the image<br>and likeness of God<br>and I guess we're so familiar with that<br>sometimes we forget that that is a very<br>profound way of speaking about humanity<br>and Human Nature<br>this provides the starting point for<br>relating to the stranger<br>and as John Taylor formal General<br>Secretary of CMS in Britain and Bishop<br>of Winchester reminds us in his amazing<br>book The go between God the Holy Spirit<br>and Christian Mission<br>he says if one is closed up against<br>being hurt or blown towards<br>one's fellow human beings then one is<br>inevitably shut off from God also<br>when one cannot be one cannot choose to<br>be open in One Direction and closed in<br>the African philosophy of Ubuntu<br>made Popular by South African Archbishop<br>Desmond Tutu might help us here<br>Ubuntu describes the interconnectedness<br>or togetherness of all human beings<br>and that it's only possible to become a<br>person through other persons<br>so Bishop tutu writes<br>that Ubuntu speaks to the very essence<br>of Being Human<br>when you want to give High Praise to<br>he or she has Ubuntu this means that<br>they are generous hospitable<br>friendly caring and compassionate they<br>share what they have<br>it also means that my humanity is caught<br>up as inextricably bound up and theirs<br>or in yours<br>we belong in a bundle of life we say a<br>person as a person through other people<br>it's not the Cartesian the renewed a cat<br>idea I think therefore I am it says<br>rather I am human because I belong<br>I participate I share<br>a person with Ubuntu is open and<br>available to others affirming of others<br>does not feel threatened that others are<br>able and good for he or she has a proper<br>self-assurance that comes with knowing<br>that he or she belongs in a greater<br>whole<br>and is diminished when others are<br>humiliated or diminished and others are<br>tortured or oppressed or treated as if<br>they were less than who they are<br>it's a really wonderful vision isn't it<br>I am because we are<br>I am because we belong to one another I<br>so in many ways this challenges the<br>concept of stranger<br>because as we participate in our<br>we recognize our need of one another<br>therefore the practice of hospitality<br>can be subversive<br>because it undermines and challenges the<br>fear of The Stranger<br>it restores human dignity and respect<br>can encourage generosity<br>the very practice of hospitality can<br>also protect us from the danger of<br>abusing ownership and possession<br>Hospitality to the stranger is in fact a<br>statement about how we perceive<br>ownership and possession<br>in God's New World God's new Reign God's<br>New Kingdom if you like we sit lightly<br>to ownership and possession because the<br>call to follow Christ<br>means that we're willing to give up<br>everything to belong to Christ's family<br>Jesus reinforces this in the two great<br>texts of Luke 14 and Matthew 25 where he<br>distinguishes between conventional and<br>Christian hospitality<br>and Luke 14 he says when you give a<br>dinner or a banquet do not invite your<br>friends or your brothers and sisters or<br>your kins people or Rich neighbors<br>unless they also invite you in return<br>and you be repaid<br>but when you give a feast invite the<br>poor the maimed the lame the blind<br>and you'll be blessed because they<br>cannot repay you<br>this is of course the Prelude to the<br>parable of the great banquet a powerful<br>metaphor for God's Reign where all are<br>universally welcomed and when the<br>expected guests turn down the invitation<br>to the banquet the same four groups are<br>invited<br>or demand the lame the blind and then<br>everyone else from the highways and by<br>e and to Matthew 25 Jesus explicitly<br>identifies himself with the stranger<br>hear God's invitation into God's realm<br>is clearly linked to Christian<br>Hospitality in this life<br>this has been a key passage in the<br>entire Christian tradition of<br>hospitality<br>North American Dorothy Day one of the<br>founders of the Catholic Worker movement<br>explained the significance of this<br>palette passage for her life of<br>hospitality to destitute people<br>she wrote there he was homeless<br>would a church take him in today feed<br>him clothe him offer him a bed<br>I hope I ask myself that question on the<br>last day of my life<br>I once prayed and prayed to God that he<br>and ultimately Israel's obligation to<br>care for the stranger is because of her<br>experience as a stranger and alien<br>Gordon strikes them to care for the<br>alien and stranger as they themselves<br>were aliens in the land of Egypt and<br>just as God created them as a nation<br>delivered them from slavery in Egypt and<br>fed them in the wilderness so their<br>Hospitality in turn<br>serves as a reminder of and witness to<br>God's Hospitality towards them<br>and always they have the stories and<br>their tradition that guests and<br>strangers might be Angels bringing<br>Divine promises and Division and<br>provision<br>and in the early church Hospitality was<br>an important discipline offering care to<br>strangers with one of the distinctive<br>fatality as seeing the other<br>I think that to be able to practice<br>Hospitality well we need the gift of<br>sight<br>and this is a gift of the Holy Spirit as<br>John Taylor reminds us<br>the holy spirit is the go-between the go<br>between God who opens our inward eyes<br>and makes us aware of the other person<br>the holy spirit is that power which<br>opens eyes that are closed hearts that<br>are unaware and Minds that shrink from<br>the concept of sight and recognition of<br>the other are clear in the Matthew 25<br>parable<br>when the righteous say to Jesus Lord<br>when did we see you hungry and feed you<br>or thirsty and give you something to<br>drink<br>when did we see you a stranger and<br>invite you in or needing clothes and<br>clothe you when did we see you sick in<br>prison and go and visit you<br>and we all know Jesus's answer<br>so here again we experience the<br>subversive dimension of hospitality<br>when we do what Jesus commanded in<br>Matthew 25 visit those in prison feed<br>the hungry clothe the naked entertain<br>the stranger we are living out a very<br>different set of values and<br>relationships<br>we are recording dignity to others<br>we're breaking social boundaries we are<br>including those who are so often<br>excluded we are engaged in<br>transformation<br>and it begins with seeing the other the<br>act of recognition a powerful act indeed<br>looking the other in the eye now I<br>realize that's not appropriate in all<br>cultures but for the purposes of this<br>metaphor bear with me looking the other<br>in the eye the establishment of the eye<br>thou relationship is a fundamental Act<br>of hospitality<br>because it acknowledges people's<br>Humanity Accords them dignity and denies<br>invisibility<br>as Christine Paul says<br>Hospitality resists boundaries that<br>endanger persons by denying their<br>humanness<br>it saves others for the from the<br>invisibility that comes from social<br>abandonment<br>sometimes by the very Act of welcome<br>a whole a vision for a whole society is<br>offered a small evidence that<br>transformed relations are possible<br>just by the small Act of welcome<br>so think of the Good Samaritan who<br>refused to pass by or pretend that he<br>had not seen the wounded man<br>his act of hospitality crossed ethnic<br>boundaries<br>caused him personal cost and<br>inconvenience<br>and literally saved a life<br>when we see the other person we see the<br>image of God as well as our common<br>Humanity which establishes a fundamental<br>dignity respect and common Bond<br>so the parable of Matthew 25 reminds us<br>that we can see Christ in every guest<br>if we had been able to see the other<br>might the genocide and Rwanda never have<br>happened for example<br>if we were able to see the other might<br>the war and Ukraine invasion of Ukraine<br>the resistance to welcoming migrants<br>vaccine hesitancy<br>the ignorance and apathy concerning<br>Congo or Myanmar apartheid in South<br>Africa tribalism<br>cast and class systems oppressive<br>colonialism<br>might all this have been avoided if only<br>we could see<br>who are we blind to in our contexts<br>which prevents us from seeing the other<br>person and wishingly or unwittingly<br>means that we practice a Theology of<br>exclusion rather than one of embrace<br>might be the darn it the Untouchable the<br>homeless person whom we've never noticed<br>before whom we've never seen before whom<br>we've always passed by on the street and<br>never looked in the owner exchanged to<br>greeting<br>might be the older women in our<br>congregations who always Faithfully<br>provide the food do the flowers clean<br>the church<br>have we ever taken the time to see them<br>and to thank them<br>might it be the younger people whose<br>music is so loud whose language is<br>incomprehensible whose body piercing and<br>head shaving is so alien<br>have we ever stopped to look them in the<br>eye to appreciate their music to<br>consider the pressures they may be under<br>The Bleak Prospect of unemployment or a<br>minimum wage broken home student loans<br>and uncertain future climate grief and<br>anxiety<br>have we ever stopped to look them in the<br>eye and tried to understand them and<br>their context<br>you might be those migrants who never<br>learn our language who never even who<br>never even try to integrate who take<br>over whole streets and suburbs in our<br>cities<br>have we ever had them in our homes<br>offered them hospitality and tried to<br>see their culture<br>so in humility let us ask ourselves whom<br>the Holy Spirit might be calling us to<br>see<br>Christian hospitality and Christian<br>Mission require that we actively see the<br>guest and Stranger in our worlds<br>this means that we will see the other as<br>authentically other and allow them the<br>space to be who they are created to be<br>in Christ<br>failure to do so can eventuate in the<br>most terrible atrocities<br>and I think here of one of I think here<br>of one of British journalist furgo<br>Keynes moving Reflections on the<br>genocide in Rwanda<br>in a book he wrote or an article he<br>wrote called a letter from Africa<br>so he said on seeing a machete baby<br>trapped between the rocks and a river<br>he asked himself the question<br>what kind of man would kill a baby what<br>kind of man<br>and he concluded after having<br>experienced the hatred the evil and the<br>lack of recognition of the others right<br>to exist<br>what kind of man can kill a child<br>a man not born to hate but who has<br>learned hatred<br>so Christianity is a way of seeing and<br>here we are trying to see or Envision a<br>world where Hospitality becomes a way of<br>life<br>the parable of the great banquet and for<br>the sheep and the goats do indeed mean a<br>reconstruction or even a reversal of<br>reality<br>God's Universal welcome is displayed<br>and as we see the other we are welcoming<br>Jesus<br>this is indeed a new way of seeing and<br>it makes me think of the Occupy slogan<br>you remember the Occupy Movement which<br>is actually what I adopted for the<br>so moving on to hospitality as<br>nourishment<br>Christine Paul reminds us that we need<br>to eat together to sustain our identity<br>think how important it is to eat<br>together as a family and the same<br>applies to our faith communities<br>she writes the table as Central to the<br>practice of hospitality in home and<br>church the nourishment we gain there is<br>physical spiritual and social<br>offering food and drink to guests<br>essential to almost every Act of<br>Hospital<br>and this takes time<br>it requires attention and attentiveness<br>to the other it requires an effort<br>that requires us to stop and to focus<br>is there Benedictine monk once observed<br>in a fast food culture you have to<br>remind yourself that some things cannot<br>be done quickly<br>Hospitality takes time<br>and this is a challenge in our time<br>starved culture<br>Hospitality emerges from a willingness<br>to create time and space<br>the theme of banqueting of food and<br>drink is Central to the ministry of<br>Jesus<br>was he not accused of being a glutton<br>and a drunkard and of eating with<br>sinners<br>Jesus was celebrating the Messianic<br>Messianic banquet but with all the wrong<br>people<br>British Theologian Luke breatherton even<br>goes so far as to State this table<br>Fellowship was Sinners and the<br>reconfiguring of Israel's Purity<br>boundaries which this Hospitality<br>represents signifies the very heart of<br>Jesus's mission<br>Jesus and his followers are celebrating<br>the abundance of God think of all the<br>stories of food and drink overflowing of<br>parties and Joy To The Feeding of the<br>five thousand<br>God's household is a household of super<br>abundance of extravagant Hospitality<br>where food and wine are generously<br>shared and the Divine welcome<br>universally offered<br>Jesus's rejection of Social and<br>religious categories of inclusion and<br>exclusion was offense<br>authorities<br>as one Theologian expressed it Jesus got<br>himself crucified by the way he it<br>shared meals are therefore Central to<br>hospitality and to Mission<br>North American Bible and Ministry<br>Professor Michelle Hershberger claims<br>that when we eat together<br>we are playing out the drama of Life As<br>We Begin to share stories let down our<br>guard and welcome strangers<br>and alongside the sharing of food is the<br>sharing of stories<br>Reverend Rebecca nagenye chaplain at<br>Uganda Christian University told me that<br>in Uganda Hospitality goes with both<br>elaborate meals and listening to the<br>visitor<br>ugandans believe that for any<br>relationship to be strong food and<br>intentional listening must be shared<br>listening is an important part of<br>honoring the guest and both hospitality<br>and admission listening to the other is<br>the begin beginning of understanding and<br>of entering into the other's world<br>and eating together is a great leveler I<br>remember one of our tutors when we were<br>studying at all nations invited us<br>around for dinner and they gave us<br>spaghetti bolognese and Miranda said to<br>us you've got to get off your high horse<br>to eat spaghetti bolognese it's a great<br>leveler<br>it's something we all must do eating<br>together and it has a<br>Hazard I mention when we eat together as<br>we let down our garden share Stories We<br>Begin to create relationship and this is<br>at the heart of mission our relationship<br>with God and with one another<br>Roman Castle Ugandan Theologian Emmanuel<br>katongole whom I referred to last night<br>rights of an African proverb now listen<br>to this it takes a bit of getting ahead<br>around he says unless you hear the mouth<br>eating you cannot hear the mouth eating<br>unless you hear the mouth eating you<br>cannot hear the mouth eating<br>so what does it mean by that well I<br>think this proverb points to the<br>significance of friendship that emerges<br>from the act of eating together<br>and how only through and out of such<br>eating together is one able to hear one<br>another's cries or to discern their<br>genuine needs<br>and a unique Moment In the book of<br>Ephesians we see Jews and Gentiles<br>coming together<br>the test of their coming together was<br>the meal table<br>the institution that once symbolized<br>ethnic and cultural division now becomes<br>a symbol of Christian Living<br>eating together<br>is a political Act<br>when we eat<br>how we eat<br>from where we eat with whom we eat<br>are important Acts these can tell us<br>much about Hospitality towards one<br>another and towards the planet<br>and in this way I think that eating<br>together can locates Us in the mission<br>of God<br>it is a political act to eat together as<br>we think about with whom we eat and<br>where our food comes from<br>we need to be mindful about where our<br>food comes from and to be grateful to<br>the Earth that feeds us<br>North American botanist and member of<br>the citizen Potawatomi Nation Robin wall<br>camera<br>have any of you come across here<br>or this would resonate very much with um<br>Maori and Indigenous spirituality<br>worldwide I think she reminds us of the<br>importance of resisting the scarcity<br>narrative and to practicing gratitude<br>and this seems to me to be deeply linked<br>to hospitality<br>so um<br>she says recognizing abundance rather<br>than scarcity undermines an economy that<br>Thrive by creating unmet desires<br>gratitude cultivates an ethic of<br>fullness but the economy needs emptiness<br>gratitude doesn't send you out shopping<br>to find satisfaction<br>it comes as a gift rather than a<br>commodity subverting the foundation of<br>the whole economy that's good medicine<br>for land and people alike and that book<br>writing speech graphs I tell you that<br>was the read of my the best read of my<br>first lockdown it's a fantastic book<br>and in that book she talks about the<br>Thanksgiving address of her nation which<br>thanks the land the crops the trees and<br>the birds the winds moon stars and Sun<br>the teachers the ancestors and the<br>Creator<br>it inculcates the culture of gratitude<br>and a cycle of reciprocity<br>powerful political document a social<br>contract a way of being all in one piece<br>but first and foremost it is the cradle<br>for a culture of gratitude<br>so these themes of gratitude and<br>reciprocity are profoundly linked to the<br>practice of hospitality to one another<br>and to our planet<br>and perhaps this idea of nourishment is<br>then most powerfully expressed in the<br>Eucharist<br>where this ritualized eating and<br>drinking together reenacts the Crux of<br>the Gospel<br>as we remember what it costs to Jesus to<br>welcome us into relationship with God<br>we remember with sorrow The Agony and<br>the pain but at the same time we rejoice<br>and celebrate our reconciliation and<br>this new relationship made possible<br>because of Christ's sacrifice<br>and supreme Act of hospitality<br>we rejoice in our new relationship with<br>God made possible through the cross and<br>we rejoice as we partake of this meal<br>together in community<br>when we share in the Eucharist we are<br>not only foreshadowing the great<br>heavenly banquet to come<br>but we are also nourished on our journey<br>toward God's banqueting table<br>Jesus is quite literally the host as we<br>partake of his body and blood and we are<br>the guests as we feed on him thy faith<br>with Thanksgiving<br>and this way the Eucharist connects<br>Hospitality at a very basic level with<br>God and with Mission as it anticipates<br>and reveals God's Heavenly table and<br>God's coming Kingdom<br>and I think this is beautifully<br>expressed in one of the Eucharistic<br>prayers from the Anglican New Zealand<br>prayer book<br>most merciful Lord<br>your love compels us to come in<br>our hands were unclean our hearts were<br>unprepared<br>we were not fit even to eat the crumbs<br>from under your table<br>that you Lord are the god of our<br>salvation and share your bread with<br>sinners<br>so cleanse and feed us with the precious<br>body and blood of your son that he may<br>live in us and we in him<br>and that we with the whole company of<br>Christine Paul believes that hospitality<br>is a way of embodying the sacrament of<br>God's love to the world<br>and that it should be core to our<br>identity as followers of Jesus<br>she says the Christian tradition really<br>understands Hospitality in a fuller way<br>and the sense of its embodying a<br>faithful response to who God is and what<br>God has done in such an extraordinary<br>fatality from or at the edges<br>Christine Paul contends that the periods<br>in church history and Hospitality has<br>been most vibrantly practiced have been<br>times been the hosts who themselves<br>marginal to the larger society<br>so maybe that gives us some hope<br>I think we can say that the church is<br>pretty much marginal to larger society<br>this may be because they were A<br>persecuted minority hidden away in<br>conference or poorer sectors of society<br>such as the early methodists<br>the Israelites knew what it meant to be<br>marginal they were strangers misogynists<br>actually dependent on God<br>poverty May in fact be a good place to<br>start with hospitality Poverty of heart<br>and mind create space for the other<br>Poverty of Mind heart and even resources<br>where one is not constrained by one's<br>possessions but one is able to give<br>freely<br>Hospitality from the margins reminds us<br>of the paradoxical power of<br>vulnerability and the importance of<br>compassion<br>poll cites the example of a friend of<br>hers<br>who directs a home for homeless people<br>and who every year takes a few days to<br>live on the streets<br>by doing this he experiences in a small<br>way what it means to be marginal and<br>invisible and he describes the impact of<br>this<br>he says what I experience in these<br>Journeys is replenishing the reservoir<br>of compassion<br>I tend not to realize how hardened I've<br>become until I get out there and when I<br>see someone mistreating the homeless a<br>professional it's a prophetic voice<br>it's the most effective teaching method<br>for me<br>to make oneself vulnerable reminds us<br>that both hospitality and engagement and<br>Mission require authentic compassion and<br>genuine love<br>somehow these are more freely expressed<br>and experienced from a context of<br>poverty poverty both within and without<br>Poverty of heart and mind reminds us<br>that we are the needy ones<br>that our hands were empty before God<br>filled them that we are in need of Grace<br>forgiveness healing and newness of life<br>then genuine hospitality<br>as well as genuine engagement and<br>Mission can begin as we realize our own<br>emptiness and our need for God<br>as we experience the Divine welcome born<br>out of divine compassion so then we can<br>share this grace and Hospitality with<br>others<br>at CMS we talk a lot about the edges and<br>believe that people at the edges are<br>actually at the center of God's story<br>English priests our Barrett and Ruth<br>Harley write about life at the edges in<br>their Parish context and quite a tough<br>part of Birmingham<br>they offer an important challenge to the<br>church in this context<br>they describe Edge places as places that<br>are normally the furthest away sometimes<br>geographically and usually economically<br>culturally and politically<br>far from the centers of power resources<br>and decision making<br>in our Collective imagination Edge<br>places can be seen as somehow defective<br>lacking something<br>perhaps even a problem<br>they challenge us to reimagine Edge<br>places<br>of abundance<br>of life and potential<br>and they would like us to see the Church<br>formed at the borders and encounters<br>with others and believe that this would<br>invite us to think more in terms of a<br>rather strange where they invented<br>encounterology<br>the way in which we can become Church<br>precisely because of these encounters on<br>the edges<br>and counterology actually was a term<br>originally used by a South African<br>messiologist clippy's kritzinger to<br>express the idea that mission is a<br>two-way encounter so thinking of<br>reciprocity here so he says in a real<br>encounter both partners are transformed<br>and border crossing encounters are basic<br>to Christian epistemology<br>we will not feather the depths of God's<br>love and shall we know it together with<br>all the saints<br>so we've already seen samwell's Express<br>this as being with<br>barrish and Harley Express this as a<br>kind of radical receptivity<br>where the flow is not one way<br>where there are abundant gifts and<br>challenges to be received from our<br>neighbors<br>where the church resists initiatives and<br>projects but is willing to receive<br>friendship and hospitality<br>so this then puts the church in a<br>position to receive to listen and to<br>learn<br>to discover the treasure that is already<br>there<br>as North American theologians Steve<br>Bevins and Roger Schroeder assert a<br>guest is always a blessing<br>for a guest brings new ways of seeing<br>and understanding the world<br>guests also need to be sensitive to the<br>fact that learning to accept Hospitality<br>gratefully and graciously is perhaps the<br>best way to be of service to the hopes<br>hosts<br>so perhaps we could imagine the church<br>as listener<br>guest at other people's tables in need<br>of Being Served<br>in other words the church as a guest<br>which I think could then change and<br>Challenge and perhaps redefine the power<br>dynamics in new ways<br>and then finally Hospitality as creating<br>space<br>the very Act of Creation is an act of<br>creating space and the concept of the<br>Trinity allows space for the created<br>individual but only in relationship to<br>the other<br>our trinitarian understanding of God<br>expressed so beautifully in this Icon by<br>rublev means that we experience God in a<br>relationship with the other within<br>community<br>so each person of the Trinity has their<br>own divine nature expressed in relation<br>there is the space to be each Divine<br>person as each person relates to the<br>other but they cannot exist without this<br>relationship<br>so this understanding of this Trinity<br>allows us to welcome others in and to<br>reach out to others<br>it picks up many themes of hospitality<br>here of Welcome of the home or household<br>as the place for Hospitality of<br>relationship of seeing the other of<br>nourishment<br>North American Theologian Catherine<br>Lacuna comments on this item she says<br>how fishing indeed that hospitality and<br>the quite ordinary setting of a<br>household should have emerged as the<br>inspiration in the psych for this icon<br>and so many other artistic<br>interpretations of the trinity<br>and rublev's icon the temple in the<br>background is the transformation of<br>Abrahams and Sarah's house<br>the oak tree stands for the tree of life<br>and the position of the three figures is<br>suggestive<br>although they're arranged in a circle<br>the circle is not closed<br>one has the distinct sensation when<br>meditating on the Cyclone that one is<br>not only invited into this communion but<br>indeed one is already a part of it<br>a self-contained God a closed Divine<br>society would hardly be a fishing<br>architect archetype for hospitality<br>and we should not miss the significance<br>of the Eucharistic Cup and the center<br>which is of course the sacramental sign<br>of our communion with God and with one<br>another<br>so this is what a closed Society but<br>rather an open circle an open Community<br>where there is always great space<br>this space for each Divine person there<br>is space for the other and so there's<br>face for us<br>created in the Divine image to become<br>Dutch women Catholic priest Henry<br>nowon's definition of hospitality picks<br>up this idea of spaciousness<br>he writes Hospitality means primarily<br>the creation of a free space<br>with a stranger can enter and become a<br>friend instead of an enemy<br>hospitality is not to change people<br>but to offer them space where change can<br>take place<br>immediately we can see resonances for<br>Mission here<br>Mission the Divine and rotation from God<br>to enter into a loving relationship with<br>God is about allowing people the space<br>and the time to come to God in their own<br>way to become the person God created<br>them to be<br>it also means allowing for the<br>possibility that they may not want to<br>change<br>as English Theologian poor fides writes<br>in his book participating in God<br>respect for others of course means so<br>that we must also be ready to be<br>Christine Paul reminds us that<br>hospitality is a way of life<br>as a way of life the way that God hath<br>created us she says I think I think this<br>means that hospitality is good for both<br>hosts and guests<br>when we do that we experience some of<br>what God intended in God's economy<br>that this would be a practice that is<br>good for every<br>as a way of life it then resists the<br>isolation and mistrust that we can<br>experience as a result of the Fall<br>and she recognizes the power dynamics<br>where the host can have more control so<br>she exhorts us also to be the guest to<br>recognize our own vulnerabilities and<br>needs<br>and just as Barrett and Harley entitled<br>their book being interrupted<br>Paul reminds us of exactly that that<br>Hospitality can come to us as an<br>interruption<br>and that if our schedules are so busy<br>then we're not going to see the<br>opportunity for hospitality<br>this is why it's so important to see it<br>as a way of life and to create space in<br>so Hospitality involves welcome<br>listening learning seeing and nourishing<br>the other and they go into their<br>negotiation of space by all parties<br>Hospitality can embody the sacrament of<br>God's love to the world<br>ultimately hospitality is a way of life<br>and requires a reorientation in how we<br>live our lives<br>so let me conclude with a brief and<br>rather lovely Celtic prayer<br>I saw a stranger last night<br>I put food in the eating place<br>drink and the drinking place<br>music in the listening place<br>and in the sacred name of the Triune he<br>blessed myself<br>into my house and my cattle and my dear<br>ones<br>and the Lark said in her song often<br>often often goes Christ and goes to<br>Christ and the strangest guys<br>amen<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
