Pro Vice<br>Chancellor Health Sciences Professor<br>Irma<br>tenakoto<br>um<br>I'm Trish priest as she said I'm the<br>acting Pro Vice Chancellor of Health<br>Sciences and it is a delight to be here<br>to do the first speech of welcome and<br>introduction<br>um it's always great to learn about the<br>work and the lives of our amazing staff<br>at otago and that work of course spreads<br>well beyond the Dunedin campus which is<br>where I'm based although I just have to<br>say that I did do my um the clinical<br>years of my medical degree in<br>Christchurch so it's very familiar uh<br>being here becoming a professor is the<br>apex of the academic Journey<br>and Professor Steadman's promotion is<br>Testament to her exceptional work and<br>dedication<br>I haven't met her before but I have read<br>her CV and I wholeheartedly agree with<br>others who've told me that this is a<br>promotion that was well over time and<br>very much deserved<br>she has comprehensively met the<br>requirements for elevation to<br>professorship<br>I'm really here just to generally<br>welcome you and particularly to welcome<br>Catherine's parents Peter and Adrian<br>Malcolm her husband Phil and children<br>William Luke and Isabelle and The Wider<br>family obviously so particularly welcome<br>to you and anyone who's watching online<br>uh it is my privilege to introduce<br>Professor Catherine Sidman and provide a<br>brief introduction to a talk<br>um I've hit the honor of uh introducing<br>people for ipls over the last five years<br>from the Department of Midland there's<br>been a number of people but I must say<br>there's nothing quite as special as<br>being able to introduce Catherine who's<br>a close colleague clinically<br>academically and also a great friend so<br>it's really a amazing privilege to be<br>able to be here to introduce you and I'm<br>very grateful for that for that honor<br>so Catherine's currently the president<br>of the New Zealand guest Society The<br>Clinical Director of gastroenterology at<br>Christchurch hospital with the<br>chairperson of the South Island<br>hepatitis C work stream any one of those<br>jobs will be full-time yeah any one of<br>them she's doing all three of those<br>things at the moment and she's done that<br>as well as other roles including<br>research teaching service and raising an<br>amazing family uh who are here today and<br>it's great to see all of you here I've<br>met you over the years<br>Catherine was awarded a university of<br>otago Christchurch research gold medal<br>in 2019.<br>she achieved this Accolade with probably<br>the fewest published papers of anyone<br>who's ever done it because each paper<br>was so impactful<br>and that's really an amazing Accolade<br>and tonight we celebrate care from<br>becoming the first female<br>gastroenterologist to the appointment of<br>Professor of medicine in New Zealand and<br>that's a very important Accolade and<br>something I'm very proud to be able to<br>introduce<br>Kirsten completed her undergraduate<br>medical education at the University I<br>take with clinical years in both<br>Christchurch and Wellington<br>commit specialist training<br>gastroenterology and clinical<br>pharmacology in Christchurch and<br>completed this training in Westmead and<br>Sydney<br>she completed a PhD in molecular<br>pharmacology and cholestasis from the<br>University of Sydney in the stall of the<br>unit including work undertaken at the<br>Salk Institute in California<br>on a return to Christchurch hospital as<br>a consultant gastroenterologist she<br>commits Clinical Research into new<br>antiviral therapies for Hepatitis C<br>atherine has always been motivated by<br>research that helps to solve the<br>problems of medical need and her<br>training in both gastroenterology and<br>clinical pharmacology means that she has<br>the expertise in new drug development to<br>do this<br>many liver problems to begin as<br>unexplained hepatitis and Catherine's<br>research Journey involves discovering<br>the cause of hepatitis in the<br>development of targets for treatment and<br>eventual cure Catherine has been<br>involved at the Forefront of development<br>of new oral antiviral viral therapies<br>for Hepatitis C that were first<br>demonstrated to cure hepatitis C right<br>here in New Zealand we should be very<br>proud of that achievement<br>This research is led to Major progress<br>in treating people with Advanced liver<br>disease and the who adopting Global<br>health goals for Hepatitis C elimination<br>so that's eliminating a disease and I<br>think for those of you who work in<br>medicine can understand what a huge<br>impact that is and as we'll hear the<br>therapies that have been developed by<br>Catherine and others have saved<br>countless lives worldwide<br>autoimmune liver diseases have also had<br>a high incidence in New Zealand and<br>Catherine's research has also been<br>involved in understanding the<br>epidemiology of these liver diseases and<br>the impact they have on people who are<br>affected by them<br>in this IPL ketron will discuss who her<br>research journey through these fields of<br>medical development in the rewarding<br>interface of combining areas outside<br>medicine including motherhood with<br>academic medical specialist career<br>in our Mana in a rare<br>however<br>a<br>uh Pura and welcome thank you so much<br>for attending tonight I want to<br>acknowledge the different status of<br>people here the different languages<br>tribes ethnicities uh represented here<br>and also some of my mentors and<br>superiors over the years and also um<br>Creator God<br>so it's my great privilege to welcome<br>you to my IPL I'm very delighted to be<br>here and present to you tonight on<br>hepatitis C and liver disease the<br>journey to cure and eliminate<br>I thought before I start on the research<br>so I'd say how did I get here<br>um and I want to acknowledge my whanau<br>my parents um Peter and Adrian in<br>particular because I would not be here<br>if it wasn't for them and so if I look<br>back on the generations I had a<br>grandmother on my mother's side who<br>found herself as a single parent in the<br>1940s with children to bring up in no<br>education she left school at 12. and so<br>she put a value on education for women<br>that's passed on through the generations<br>in our family and so this is actually my<br>mother's gown she went to University the<br>first sort of of the family so<br>um and then I grew up in a family where<br>my father had just finished his thesis<br>about teeth so if any of you ever go to<br>a dentist and he says oh the reason your<br>tooth is falling apart is because it was<br>cut into when you were younger that's<br>the research my father did back a little<br>while ago so um so I came from a family<br>that put a value on Education and<br>Research and Science and then um in my<br>training I actually did no research for<br>medical school I'm afraid<br>um but then when I was a registry I did<br>six months of clinical pharmacology with<br>Murray Buckley who's here tonight and<br>also Evan big and managed to sort of<br>eventually get two papers out from that<br>six months<br>um<br>I think my supervisor has said they said<br>your first paper is like birthing a baby<br>it takes forever and they were like that<br>I did a review paper on proton pump and<br>hubbers which are the common drugs half<br>of you probably take for heartburn<br>Omeprazole things like that and some<br>other proper sort of research where we<br>did a project I had some really valuable<br>lessons I learned firstly the value of<br>an unpublished<br>niche in the medical literature if you<br>can find something no one's done before<br>it's easy to get published and that was<br>the case of my proton pump inhibitor<br>review no one had done it before and it<br>was just a nice easy Journey Through the<br>publication the other project we did<br>um we did really well but it took two<br>years to get it published and that's<br>because it was a negative study result<br>and so I learned the difficulties of a<br>negative publication bias when it comes<br>to research and I also discovered that<br>research has a really great flexible<br>option with a young baby because William<br>was born around that time and good way<br>to keep doing something keeping your<br>brain going but a bit more flexibility<br>I've encountered the family off to<br>Sydney<br>and embarked on some research in Sydney<br>so I was based at the store of United<br>Westmead<br>um I did actually along the way pack up<br>a sort of an accidental job working with<br>Johnson and Johnson which proved<br>actually when you see what I did later<br>became very useful so in this job I was<br>doing Global Drug safety work in the<br>Asia Pacific team I got a lot of<br>experience with the FDA with<br>International regulatory environment<br>clinical trial design and good clinical<br>practice and so that was actually it<br>proved very valuable later on to me<br>although I just did it at the time for<br>the money<br>um so uh so I did that a little on the<br>side to help us pay some bills I had two<br>wonderful mentors in Sydney Chris little<br>and Jacob George both professors of meds<br>and wonderful men great mentors to me<br>and so they got me started on this<br>pathway of liver research<br>so the basic premise here if we start<br>looking at liver research just for those<br>of you are not in the field is you know<br>most of your majority of people are born<br>with a nice healthy liver looks like<br>there's a limbs right at the butcher's<br>shop<br>um but things happen to your liver along<br>the way so if we look at these things<br>drugs might affect it viruses might<br>affect alcohol might affect it being<br>overweight might affect it or immune<br>injury or other things might damage the<br>liver and then it gets this process of<br>scar tissue development becomes fibrosis<br>and then becomes serotic or cirrhosis of<br>the liver and it's severe a state of<br>severe scarring of the liver and one of<br>the things that leads to is liver<br>failure and death all over cancer and so<br>most of the a lot of research in the<br>field of liver disease is around looking<br>at what can we do to stop that process<br>of progression so what can we do about<br>the causes how can we slow progression<br>or what can we do about the protective<br>mechanisms in the liver that help<br>um so I'm going to get the sort of basic<br>science bit out of the way at the<br>beginning of the talk<br>um so in Sydney I I was plunged into a<br>career as a transition really as to a<br>mouse surgeon and a laboratory scientist<br>quite a shock when you come straight out<br>of clinical meds and I have to say you<br>have to go back to being shown how to do<br>all the basics so cholestatic liver<br>disease is a special type of liver<br>disease where um bile flow is affected<br>so if we look the bile flows down the<br>bile ducts out of the liver if something<br>blocks this process it might be a tumor<br>it might be a gallstone or it might be<br>an immune process or a drug reaction<br>that damages the lining of the bile<br>ducts the bile can't flow and the bile<br>gets backed up and bile lessons are like<br>detergents and then they damage the<br>liver<br>so that's the cluster of liver disease<br>and so one animal model is to operate on<br>mice and tie off to operation and tie<br>off the bile duct so it's a good way of<br>mimicking human disease and so in Sydney<br>I ended up doing quite a lot of work<br>using this model with my special mice<br>that had humanized transgenes or nuclear<br>receptors genes knocked out<br>so I'm just going to do a little bit on<br>this won't go on for too long then I'll<br>get onto hep C<br>um but these cholestatic liver disease<br>we did a lot of work looking at things<br>called nuclear receptors and these are<br>things like fxrpxr car these are<br>basically things that get that drugs and<br>bile lessons bind to if you look at the<br>picture the drugs and biolations bind to<br>the nuclear receptors<br>um and then they bind to genes and they<br>switch genes on and off so this is how<br>so my first Sydney project was looking<br>at a special Gene in the liver<br>um called sip3a This is actually a human<br>gene that was put into the mice so I<br>didn't do that there had been done<br>before I got there and it's a really<br>important Gene because it controls this<br>enzyme called sip 304 that actually<br>breaks down about 60 of all drugs we use<br>or take and it breaks down natural<br>substances like bile acids and other<br>things as well<br>so one of the things we wanted to look<br>at is whether this Gene is switched on<br>as a protective mechanism and people<br>with this bile acid overload and so we<br>we did the biodegregations and if you<br>look at the pictures here you'll see<br>that after three six and ten days<br>afterwards these genes were this Gene<br>was really strongly switched on in these<br>mice so this showed that this is up<br>regulated in response to cholestasis<br>um at the same time we did a bit of work<br>actually looking at a human study<br>because there are some herbal drugs<br>often actually pharmacologically active<br>and so one herbal drug we looked at was<br>St John's wart this is used usually for<br>depression but there are drug<br>interactions reported via this<br>particular enzyme sup3a and one of the<br>constituents does bind to one of those<br>nuclear receptors pxr<br>and so we did a clinical trial of<br>patients who had cholestatic liver<br>disease and gave them this herbal drug<br>to see what it did and it did improve<br>symptoms in some of these patients<br>um but we also got some quite varied<br>outcomes and I got another learning<br>about research process because we<br>actually quite a heterogeneous group of<br>patients with different causes for the<br>cholestasis and that actually upset some<br>of the results because so I learned<br>quite a lot about the importance of<br>really tight inclusion criteria if<br>you're answering a really specific<br>question<br>at the same time I did a big review<br>paper on herbal drugs and their toxic<br>effects on the liver and that gave me<br>the privilege of being like a world<br>expert on that topic for a few years<br>which was interesting but I found that<br>it's been very valuable evidence of<br>knowledge ever since<br>um during this time I also got the<br>opportunity to go to the soul constitute<br>in San Diego and work with Ron Evans<br>laboratory there and he's probably one<br>of the top scientists in the world runs<br>a huge big gene expression laboratory in<br>San Diego at The salka Institute it was<br>an amazing opportunity I felt really<br>insecure going here I am this little<br>doctor from New Zealand what do I know<br>but what I learned is about the value of<br>partnership because I brought the<br>clinical application I could see where<br>things might go where they might be<br>clinically relevant they didn't get that<br>because they're not doctors and they<br>didn't have much gastroenterology<br>training I also could actually have the<br>surgical technique to make the<br>experiments work which they couldn't<br>make work either so it was a good<br>partnership they had all these mice they<br>had all these genes knocked out<br>um the car pxr FXR so the genes had all<br>had these genes knocked out of these<br>mice uh and we did surgery on them and<br>then we looked at what happened and I<br>guess what we did initially was we<br>confirmed our initial hypothesis that in<br>fact if you knocked out that FXR Gene oh<br>sorry pxr Gene so that you couldn't<br>switch on the other enzyme that sip3a<br>then the mice had much worse liver<br>damage to their livers compared with the<br>other mice<br>so it showed that these protective<br>responses are really important in<br>calisthenic liver disease<br>I went back a second time<br>um to the sulk and I do apologize to<br>Phil in Luke Luke was 10 months old he<br>was fully breastfed and he got influenza<br>the day I left so that was not ideal at<br>the family level but uh full<br>magnificently survived and so did Luke<br>um<br>so um that was a sort of nine day trip I<br>think for memory and we did more of the<br>same we looked at mice with different<br>things knocked out and some interesting<br>observations that you know whereas the<br>liver damage was worse if you knocked<br>out pxr in fact if you knocked out FXR<br>they got less liver damage and the two<br>things seem to cancel each other out and<br>then we did a whole lot of work they had<br>these big molecular things which I won't<br>War you with looking at lots and lots of<br>genes and Transporters and things to do<br>with cholesterol and how all these<br>nuclear receptors control those and and<br>we've got a lot of very useful data from<br>this work<br>so that's the end of the real basic<br>science part of the talk we then came<br>back to New Zealand and at that point<br>William laughed at me when I said I was<br>a doctor he said mum you can't be a<br>doctor you only operate on mice so um<br>that was what my son thought at that<br>point<br>um so we came back to New Zealand and I<br>have continued some work on ultramian<br>liver disease as Richard very kindly<br>alluded to<br>um so autoimmune liver diseases are<br>diseases where the body attacks itself<br>basically so there's pure autoimmune<br>hepatitis where the body attacks the<br>sort of main liver and then there are<br>some autoimmune diseases that cause<br>cholestasis so it links to what I was<br>doing in Sydney so basically the immune<br>system damages the bile ducts so these<br>cause cholecytics of a disease the<br>autoimmune hepatitis started out life<br>called just chronic active hepatitis<br>they had no idea what it was then they<br>eventually worked out it was the immune<br>system attacking it uh and then we're<br>going on from there so two people have<br>done a lot of this work with me Jeffrey<br>knew who unfortunately is in Chicago at<br>the moment so away in Mahal Lemba who's<br>in Canada so neither of them is here<br>um one of the things we noticed in the<br>older older timers like Bruce would say<br>oh we seem to have a lot of autoimmune<br>hepatitis around here so we did a<br>prevalent study and we showed that in<br>fact New Zealand has one of the highest<br>prevalences of autoimmune hepatitis in<br>the world or Canterbury does my Auckland<br>colleagues tell me it's not as high up<br>there but<br>um so we have a high prevalence of<br>autoimmune hepatitis it was thought to<br>be a disease of younger women and our<br>data showed that in fact it's more a<br>disease of we call it older women in<br>this but now I'm the sage group I'm like<br>no it's like<br>um so we also showed though in contrast<br>that those other ones those cholestatic<br>autoimmune diseases actually<br>um we we just got a standard prevalence<br>of so clearly the drivers for them are<br>different they can't just all be one<br>thing out of the environment<br>now autoimmune diseases are complex they<br>had to do with environmental triggers<br>failure of immune tolerance genetic<br>predispositions and then you get this T<br>Cell immune mediated attack on some part<br>of the body simplistically so genes<br>environment ethnicity and other diseases<br>are important and so Jeffrey did a lot<br>of work looking at both genetics the<br>role of environmental factors so for<br>example antibiotics and childhood<br>increase your risk of these types of<br>things having a wood fire in your home<br>reduces the risk of these things so<br>things like that and we looked at some<br>differences between East and West as<br>well in terms of ethnic backgrounds<br>we also looked at outcomes and people<br>had tended to think that autoimmune<br>hepatitis was reasonably benign because<br>you can just throw some steroids at it<br>you can treat it it'll all be okay and<br>in fact we tracked these people over<br>five ten years and showed that in fact<br>the survival does drop off even with<br>treated autoimmune hepatitis it's about<br>a two-fold increase in mortality if you<br>look at the other diseases pbcs down<br>lower in PSC is even worse because there<br>is no treatment for PSE at the moment<br>so we showed that actually the mortality<br>is probably worse than people had<br>thought and we also did some work<br>looking at the relationship with other<br>diseases such as inflammatory bowel<br>disease and does this make PSC worse or<br>better in terms of outcomes so Jeffrey<br>did a lot of this work as his PhD with<br>um we've also looked at some changes<br>over time and<br>um what Mahal Lambert as we looked at<br>least some of these people 10 years<br>later and we showed that actually the<br>incidence of autoimmune hepatitis and<br>kendory is increasing over time<br>whereas interestingly the other two have<br>stayed flat the PSC and PBC are stayed<br>reasonably flat<br>and Mahal also has done some work<br>looking at some subtypes of autoimmune<br>hepatitis but it won't go into too much<br>detail on that front<br>so what I want to say here is the<br>autoimmune Journey for liver disease<br>um it's halfway there<br>we've got we know it's autoimmune we've<br>got some understanding of the<br>epidemiology and who gets these things<br>but it's an ongoing journey to really<br>understand what's driving this disease<br>and at the moment we have no cure we<br>have treatments for autoimmune hepatitis<br>which is just general Amino secretion<br>which improves outcomes and there are<br>some emerging drug trials in the other<br>diseases looking at some of those<br>nuclear receptors I mentioned at the<br>the other big thing though that I found<br>when I came back to Christchurch was<br>that there's a big Hep c-population in<br>Christchurch where there was<br>um and hepatitis C started off as a<br>non-a non-b hepatitis in 1963 seen in<br>the Royal Marines in 1989 they found a<br>virus and called it hepatitis C<br>and at the point I came back to<br>Christchurch uh our main treatment was<br>this drug called interferon various<br>forms of it but basically it stimulates<br>the immune system it's given by<br>injection<br>um it's a it was a fairly limited drug<br>we poisoned the nurses and I've poisoned<br>a lot of people with it but um basically<br>had low response rates less than 10 cure<br>rates and some strains of hep C even<br>lower success rates the worse your liver<br>disease got and very toxic you know we<br>we I mean I'm not joking we had people<br>end up in psychiatric hospitals we had<br>people making you know very suicidal we<br>had all sorts of terrible uh side<br>effects from this drug but it was the<br>only thing we had so we gave it a go<br>because otherwise people died of hep C<br>um at the same time there was a bit of<br>research this is not my research but<br>looking at these emerging new antiviral<br>drugs a protease inhibitor and they<br>tried giving it to some people in a few<br>trials and what happened if the viral<br>load came down for about five days and<br>then the virus mutated became resistant<br>and the viral node went up again so<br>everyone was like well that's not<br>working too well<br>um so the obvious Next Step there was a<br>huge unmet medical need in terms of hep<br>C at that point when I came back there<br>were two as a two year waiting list to<br>be seen for Ypsi in Christchurch so I<br>just thought well I'll just start seeing<br>all the hep C patients and offer them<br>what I can out of what we've got at the<br>moment<br>um so what the next step of course was<br>to try and add all these toxic drugs<br>together so they gave the pig interferon<br>and the rib of iron and the protease<br>Inhibitors<br>um and uh Linda Erickson and Judith um<br>McLaughlin were absolute soldiers trying<br>to sort of treat these patients and<br>Tracy Noonan as well got involved with<br>the trials<br>um so by putting these drugs together we<br>did get some improved response rates uh<br>in terms of outcomes so it was sort of<br>worth a go if you've got no other<br>options with a go but the toxicity was<br>even worse there was a very real risk of<br>liver decompensation and death in people<br>with cirrhosis and advanced liver<br>disease<br>um but we did about 12 trials over this<br>period And I have to acknowledge it was<br>a huge workload for the nurses and and<br>for me as well but big workloads they<br>were hard work these trials there were<br>six 12 18 months long really hard work<br>so the problem is though in this era it<br>was pretty Grim many people died from<br>liver failure from hep C outcomes if<br>you're transplanted people were really<br>bad because the virus would reinfect the<br>liver straight away because of the<br>immunosuppression they'd get fast liver<br>disease progression and they did badly<br>and even as recently as 2018 their<br>mortality from hepatitis C was 100 fold<br>higher than from HIV so it was a bad<br>disease<br>um so it gained contacted me as a<br>colleague of mine from Auckland I know<br>I'm very well<br>um and he said look<br>you've got this great phase one unit in<br>Christchurch Richard Robson who I think<br>is here somewhere in Chris one have got<br>this wonderful unit why don't you start<br>working with them and they've Now set up<br>a unit in Auckland and we can work<br>together and we can take on Hep C and<br>take on some new trials<br>I was like yep sure we've got this we've<br>got enough need we need new need new<br>options<br>um and the exciting thing I think about<br>this is that rather than just working at<br>the sort of phase three level where the<br>company tells you what to do and you<br>just enroll patients it was more an<br>opportunity to actually get involved in<br>the design of Trials and get involved in<br>what are we going to do and what's the<br>path forward<br>um so we formed a partnership and that's<br>been phenomenal<br>so the premise here was to look at oral<br>drugs to inhibit the hepsy virus so the<br>hepsy virus replicates in the liver<br>um and so there's various different<br>phases I won't go in too much detail but<br>there are protease Inhibitors polymerase<br>Inhibitors in these 5A Inhibitors so<br>these are all places you could<br>potentially Target and stop the virus<br>so the first study we did was called the<br>inform one study<br>um and this was the first in world first<br>time anyone done it in the world was we<br>took a leaf out of the HIV uh book HIV<br>has been successfully you know managed<br>by combining multiple antivirals but no<br>one had actually done it in a hep C so<br>this first study was combining two of<br>these oral antivirals<br>um we locked with these patients up for<br>um 14 days at ccst one of the patients<br>said it's fine it's like being in jail<br>but it's much nicer so I was like good<br>yep so we locked the patients up and<br>then once the viral loads came down we<br>treated them with the usual interferon<br>afterwards so what you see here is the<br>um the viral loads came down and we<br>actually got no resistance so that was<br>really exciting sort of proof of concept<br>that this might be the way forward and<br>Hep C<br>the next study um a company then that<br>sort of put us on the map we had done<br>that with an Australian group as well a<br>little company called pharmaceutical<br>then contacted us from the US and they<br>said look we've got this compound we've<br>developed up in the right hand of the<br>structure here it's called PSI 7977 they<br>were with numbers at that stage we think<br>it's got potential in hep C it's a good<br>uh polymerase inhibitor say look safe in<br>a few phase one studies we've done it<br>can be dosed once a day it looks like<br>it's not going to have such bad<br>resistance problems and it works in the<br>laboratory against all the hep C strains<br>so they said would you be interested in<br>exploring interfere on free treatment<br>for hep C and we said yes that sounds<br>great so we got 40 patients onto the<br>study<br>um and the challenge was the<br>Christchurch earthquake occurred once we<br>had all the patients on the study and I<br>had this delightful phone call from Ed<br>gain who rang me the night of the<br>earthquake so Catherine are you okay<br>is your family alive is everyone okay<br>and what are we going to do about that<br>study<br>hahaha<br>so it was this amazing effort and I have<br>to acknowledge Richard and Chris and<br>Chris Taylor who did amazing efforts to<br>keep this study afloat so they I think<br>they smuggled people into ccst and they<br>had generators and we did things and in<br>patients were incredible like the<br>patients didn't want interference<br>they're really motivated about this<br>study and we most of the patients lived<br>in East Christchurch we had a patient<br>walked in from the study with no shoes<br>on because their shoes got lost from the<br>earthquake but they walked in for their<br>study visit so huge thanks to the people<br>who took part<br>so we reported these results in San<br>Francisco so it's a it was a design the<br>first four lines basically the normal<br>treatment for interferon is was six or<br>twelve months these people got 12 weeks<br>of sophosphere or 7977 as it was then<br>um and riboviron and then they got<br>either 12 weeks eight weeks four weeks<br>or no and fear on and that had never<br>been done before so<br>um that's what we did and if you look at<br>the results you'll see here that<br>actually everybody and that first cohort<br>it was only 40 patients everybody got<br>cured<br>so there was a moment I was at San<br>Francisco this data was presented in<br>like there were hundreds and hundreds of<br>people in the multiple rooms and the<br>place was just like a pin drop it was<br>this absolute gasp at these results<br>um I walked back with one of the lead<br>people in Gilead and he said to me<br>that's just blown our entire trial<br>development program out of the window<br>globally<br>so it was that kind of thing<br>um three weeks so so this was proof of<br>concept for the first time ever that you<br>could cure hep C without interferon is<br>small numbers we were probably lucky we<br>got such good results actually<br>um so three weeks later Gilead announced<br>they were buying pharmaceut for 11<br>billion dollars<br>on the basis of that trial data we did<br>not get any of the money I'm sorry<br>um<br>Ed and I got a very nice paper in the<br>New England Journal which has got almost<br>a thousand citations so that was a real<br>Landmark for hep C<br>now we carried on<br>um so Gilead very rapidly rolled out a<br>phase three program here on the right of<br>the slide lots of Trials and you'll see<br>if you look at these so this was just on<br>genotype two and three hep C so just two<br>strains of hepsy you'll see here that<br>when we of course when you do the big<br>volume studies the numbers are Never As<br>Good As you get and we were quite lucky<br>we got such good results in the first<br>one so you'll see it depends on what<br>type of hep C you've got and how much<br>cirrhosis you've got whether you've got<br>cirrhosis or not so in fact if you had<br>cirrhosis and type 3 hep C you only had<br>about 30 cure rate on the big study<br>whereas if you had no cirrhosis and<br>genotype 2 it was close to 100. so<br>obviously there's more work to be done<br>so we did those big phase three studies<br>at the hospital here Tracy Noonan ran<br>those and the hepatology nurses<br>frantically recruited for them<br>um and uh at the same time at ccst we<br>kept going with the phase two work<br>because there was a lot more testing<br>hypothesis to be done so we looked at<br>different strains of hep C we looked at<br>different degrees of liver fibrosis<br>looked at whether people they did<br>treatment before or not different doses<br>different treatment durations<br>and we found that your optimal duration<br>was sort of<br>um 12 weeks probably for this regimen<br>prior failure within Faron was a<br>negative productive factor and that the<br>other strains didn't do so well with<br>just this combination<br>so you'll see here suppressed it well<br>but then they they relapsed the genotype<br>one and four<br>um so the next hypothesis coming back to<br>the earlier study was obviously we had a<br>second drug so gilia were fortunately<br>you know had another drug to pair up<br>with it that's why they were so Keen<br>um and this was a drug that's now become<br>ledipus via and you'll see here if you<br>look at this data that people who had<br>failed previous interferon treatment<br>went from a 10 response rate to 100 on<br>small numbers again just this we were<br>doing all this sort of testing work<br>um that rolled into a big phase three<br>program which we also took part in here<br>at the hospital the ion studies and<br>you'll see here that for genotype 1 and<br>4 hepatitis C this base conclusively<br>demonstrated that one pill once a day it<br>was a combo tablet for 12 weeks had a 97<br>cure rate for hep C<br>we carried on again during the sort of<br>uh hypotheses so I looked at more things<br>on different genotypes<br>um different durations looking at this<br>combination treatment now rather than<br>just the sophosphere what's now called<br>sophosphere look at cephosphere with<br>lydipasvia we showed that four weeks was<br>not enough your hep C doesn't go away<br>because what comes back quickly<br>um again we showed that people who had<br>failed previous and fearon didn't do<br>quite so well and we started doing more<br>specialized groups so we did some trials<br>arms looking at people with co-infectant<br>with hepatitis B co-infected with HIV<br>people with renal failure people with<br>and without cirrhosis Etc and so a good<br>number of good Publications from that<br>but I think the big motivation for us as<br>clinicians was to cure the patients you<br>know we treated hundreds and hundreds<br>and hundreds of patients in these trials<br>and you have to remember at this time<br>the only drug available was that<br>horrible toxic interferon that was the<br>only thing available anywhere in the<br>world<br>um did a couple of really nice niche<br>cohorts we looked at people with<br>hemophilia and bleeding disorders<br>because this group of people have been<br>really badly hurt by Blood product<br>contamination they've got H either HIV<br>or hep C and they're usually excluded<br>from all drug trials so we did a nice<br>little pilot group of them and cured<br>them all which was lovely<br>um and then we also branched out into<br>people whose livers were failing and<br>this was a bit of a first in the world<br>as well because traditionally you know<br>if you gave someone who's borderline<br>liver function interferon you'd<br>basically speedily took them into liver<br>failure<br>um so everyone was fairly shy of that<br>so these drugs seemed very safe so we<br>did a small cohort of 20 patients<br>you'll see over here and gave them the<br>difference versus 12 weeks and we cured<br>about two-thirds of them<br>so that was really pivotal because that<br>led to some Global Studies looking at<br>using this drug and liver failure the<br>important thing about it as it opens up<br>the question can we pull these people<br>back from dying can we pull them back<br>from needing transplantation<br>um and we can pull some of them back but<br>not everybody there's the answer I won't<br>go into all the data<br>um it also then opened up a<br>compassionate Access program from Gilead<br>which was really important for our<br>patients because as I said the ethical<br>feeling of knowing that there's a drug<br>that I'm giving to other patients who<br>can get in a drug trial that can cure<br>hep C while I have people in their 40s<br>dying in front of me from hepsy with<br>horrible feeling I have to tell you<br>um and so Gilead opened up a<br>compassionate program which I oversaw<br>for the South Island<br>um and it's lovely I think someone here<br>in the audience who was part of that and<br>to get on that you probably had to have<br>a median life expectancy of less than<br>two years and some of those people are<br>still alive now a lovely email from<br>someone else from Dunedin when my<br>promotion was announced<br>um so how do we pause somewhere there<br>um I couldn't quite work out where I<br>fitted it in but somewhere in 2012 we<br>went to London for a sabbatical this is<br>the family I didn't get permission for<br>this but anyway<br>um<br>it was great we went to King I spent<br>some time at King's College London which<br>I write one of the best liver units in<br>the whole world<br>um and what staggered me was how much<br>far ahead of them we were in hep C they<br>were actually they were giving people<br>blood transfusions every two weeks to<br>try and get them through this horrible<br>triple therapy with interferon thing and<br>I was like oh I wouldn't even be<br>offering that to my patients I'd be<br>telling them to wait because these new<br>drugs are so good<br>um so it was really nice to be for once<br>you know New Zealand way ahead of you<br>know King's College London um it was a<br>great time too um for the family great<br>family holiday for them and um also for<br>William he um conceived the dream of<br>becoming a paralympian while we were in<br>London and uh two paralympic games later<br>so it's been a huge benefit from that<br>um so we carried on and looked at other<br>strains of hep C so the genotype three<br>you'll remember well you may not<br>remember but uh the The Cure rates<br>dropped off when you got cirrhosis and<br>genotype three of hep C so Gilead had<br>another drug on the pipeline or they<br>bought it from somebody else uh called<br>valparaisvia<br>uh what was 5816 at that time for a long<br>time but it's now Val petersphere<br>um and this looked good against the<br>other strains of hep C and we did some<br>trials and that showed it was actually<br>highly effective against genotype 2 and<br>3 hepsy we then sort of broadened out<br>and started looking at this and people<br>who had failed previous treatment so one<br>of the big issues with viruses is if you<br>give them a treatment that's not<br>successful the virus mutates and then<br>becomes resistant to that class of drugs<br>so the danger is that you'll breed a<br>multi-resistant virus that becomes<br>untreatable and that's what you do not<br>want to do<br>so um what we showed with the<br>valparaisphere was and at this point<br>we're starting to nitpick you know<br>because they were getting 100 cure rates<br>across quite a lot of strains but if you<br>were you know genotype 3 and you'd<br>failed previous treatment and you had<br>Baseline what they sort of<br>euphemistically call resistance<br>Associated variations or resistance<br>mutate substitutions which basically<br>variance or mutated virus then your cure<br>rate drops off and this is the group of<br>people who are at risk of multi-drug<br>resistant virus<br>um so there was a quest to look for<br>another option for these people to to<br>rescue people<br>um so coming back to the official slide<br>in the initial concept maybe if we added<br>in a third antiviral drug this might<br>work so we already had um Savas Vivia<br>well established by this point uh<br>ledipus via for genotype one and four<br>valpadasvia for genotype two or three or<br>um and Gilead had now acquired another<br>drug called voxel aprivier which was a<br>new protease inhibitor much better than<br>the original ones so a couple of things<br>to explore here with firstly how short<br>can you go with treatment you know can<br>you drop it down from eight to twelve<br>weeks down to four weeks that would be<br>nice and convenient for everybody<br>and then secondly you know how do we<br>rescue people with with treatment<br>failure who are hard to treat<br>so I'm not going to go through all the<br>details of this but we did a whole lot<br>of arms of study again through ccst with<br>this triple combination looking at<br>different durations four six eight weeks<br>different groups of patients treatment<br>experience naive cirrhosis will not<br>bottom line<br>we found that four weeks didn't really<br>work too short<br>um and we also found that this triple<br>combination was the answer for the<br>hardest to treat group of patients we<br>cured them all in the study again that<br>was the phase two work a big phase three<br>work then went on as well which we took<br>apart took part in<br>in the meantime the big Global Market<br>expansion was happening<br>um and so Gilead of course needed to<br>recoup their 11 billion dollars so they<br>brought some phosphere to Market in 2013<br>as savaldi for a thousand US dollars per<br>tablet<br>um they said it was a price for a cure<br>which is true<br>um it was so it's 84<br>000 U.S for a course of treatment uh so<br>that put it beyond the price of most of<br>our patients pharmac surprising surprise<br>um<br>came to Market in 2014 now called<br>harvoni that has now actually funded in<br>New Zealand for people with liver<br>failure uh soft Vel or sofos came to<br>Market through the phase three studies<br>we did part of those as well astral<br>studies marketed in 2016 as a closer for<br>genotypes two and three and then the<br>triple therapy softball Vox came to<br>Market in 2017 as for Savvy pharmacist<br>still never funded that but um oh they<br>might have won an upper or two for<br>people and that's been basically<br>registered for treatment failures so<br>this created this whole sort of ethical<br>situation where you've got this highly<br>priced drug that can cure people but<br>it's beyond the reach of a lot of people<br>in the world the compassionate access<br>and access to drug trials became<br>increasingly important for our patients<br>because the other only other option<br>wasn't fair on<br>um and then the new thing that got sort<br>of spawned was the the rise of the<br>Buyers Clubs and use of generic drugs<br>made in the Indian factories and it's an<br>Australian Buyers Club tested some of<br>this we worked it looked like it was<br>actually sound pharmacologically it was<br>actually the same Factory I think they<br>just ran it overnight<br>as you do<br>um<br>and so we started and the all the<br>hepatology nurses Judith and Jess<br>particular probably and um not through<br>Linda would have left by that point<br>um we're involved in actually supporting<br>patients to import drug for their own<br>use because you could do it for a<br>fraction of the price and Ed gain and I<br>decided ethically that we thought we<br>should support patients to do this<br>because we thought it's the right thing<br>to save their livers so we treated a lot<br>of people that way as well<br>um just to be put a note of realism we<br>did lots of trials that didn't work as<br>well not everything we touched you know<br>not everything tuned to Gold there's<br>lots of drugs we trial things that<br>weren't didn't really work at all or<br>even one like this one this was a Gilead<br>when we did a few studies in studies<br>published actually worked but by that<br>point you know anything less than 95<br>wasn't good enough and they just made<br>the sort of marketing decision to kill<br>that drug because it wasn't quite as<br>good so interesting<br>um and of course some of the less<br>successful things don't even get<br>published<br>and we did get involved in some other<br>companies because then there was this<br>big Global race coming on because it's a<br>big pot of money available for hep C<br>um and so we did some work with ABV<br>looking at preview for brentis Via we<br>were less involved in the sort of design<br>of these studies so they were good to do<br>for getting patients treated we were<br>involved in both phase two and phase<br>three studies of these<br>um this was another combo drug and um<br>came through a bit later and shown to be<br>highly effective again with a sort of 98<br>cure rate<br>um so we've took part in those and then<br>that drug came to Market in 2017. so<br>that one's three tablets once a day<br>eight weeks 98 cure rate<br>um can't use it and people would liver<br>failure though it's not safe in that<br>situation<br>so um did some studies on that as well<br>but not quite as integrally as have<br>involved in the early phase work for<br>that one<br>so just moving on very quickly now to<br>what does this mean in New Zealand so at<br>the same time we started going well what<br>are we going to do about New Zealand and<br>how many people have got hep C so we we<br>formed a sort of epidemiology group we<br>worked out where we estimated about 50<br>000 people had hep C at the time it was<br>probably a bit of an overestimate<br>um we started looking at modeling with a<br>person called Jaime razavi from the CDC<br>in America<br>um and basically what we were already<br>seeing and my colleagues will all attest<br>to this we've seen rapid increases in<br>liver cancer rates relating to Heap C<br>for the last decade<br>and that's predicted to just keep on<br>increasing<br>um liver-related deaths liver-related<br>decompensation on this line<br>and that's what we would expect to keep<br>saying if we'd carried on with<br>interferon in the modeling suggested if<br>we could get these drugs funded then we<br>would reduce all those things<br>dramatically by 2030.<br>so um about 80 reduction and those nasty<br>outcomes so I had the joy of going to<br>pharmac and met with them and presented<br>all this data and went over the modeling<br>to Lobby pharmac very nicely and um ask<br>if they would look at funding a cure as<br>a high upfront cost but if you can<br>prevent years and years or Decades of<br>health care costs it's well worthwhile<br>as Richard alluded to the World Health<br>Organization in 2016<br>basically announced that hepatitis C<br>elimination should be a global goal by<br>2030 it's not going to get there by 2030<br>but it's a nice goal to have and it's<br>amazing that we're even talking about it<br>it's amazing that we're thinking of<br>getting rid of hep C<br>um we did quite a lot of work um this is<br>more lobbying kind of work with the<br>Ministry of Health looking at pillars of<br>how to get hep C eliminated from New<br>Zealand what's it going to take one of<br>the key things here is we need to work<br>with our colleagues and harm reduction<br>Services needle exchanges<br>um because we need to stop transmission<br>and treat the hep C so we've got to<br>embrace all those things and work<br>together as colleagues and really make<br>that effective so a whole lot of work<br>looking at those sorts of things and<br>Partnerships and how can we work<br>together to achieve elimination for<br>everybody because at least we look at<br>everyone treated we're not going to<br>eliminate<br>um Eden I got quite actively involved in<br>writing guidelines for New Zealand and<br>for GPS and for Specialists for hep C to<br>help people equip them once we got these<br>new drugs got some of them funded<br>and we also started doing some trials<br>with the Australians Greg Dawes group<br>from the Kirby Institute started doing a<br>lot of work looking at treating hepsy<br>and people who are actively injecting<br>drugs and this is really important<br>because we're never going to achieve<br>elimination of hep C unless we treat the<br>people who are actively injecting drugs<br>now because that's where the<br>transmission is mostly happening at the<br>moment and in what we showed in these<br>studies is that treating hep C in this<br>group is highly effective you basically<br>get almost as good a results as you do<br>and everybody else and we should be<br>targeting these people<br>um to to get them treated<br>with a lot of local efforts towards hep<br>C elimination<br>um Jenny Burks here on the audience in<br>Maryland I can see you both up there so<br>the HEB c community clinic was<br>groundbreaking Jenny formed up over 10<br>years ago got off the ground a huge<br>effort and this provides free testing<br>and treatment for people for hep C it's<br>co-located with the needle exchange just<br>um<br>Washington way and they've done an<br>amazing job and we very much partnered<br>with them over the years to to co you<br>know code come alongside treat people<br>together try and get people into trials<br>if Jenny would come and help with<br>because my patients does not have very<br>good veins I have to say so getting<br>blood out of them was quite a challenge<br>for trials<br>um so a lot of work there with the South<br>Island Alliance has been great the South<br>Island work stream I've been delighted<br>to just now hand over the chairmanship<br>of that to Philippa<br>um we've had this mobile bus get started<br>more recently which is very much a<br>partnership because it provides hepsy<br>the aim is to provide hep C testing and<br>treatment and harm reduction so needle<br>exchange and things in one package and<br>we've done a bit of work with the gut<br>Foundation as well doing some testing of<br>construction workers Jeremy tyong's been<br>working with me we've done we've offered<br>26 000 people in general primary<br>practice hips free hep C tests only a<br>fraction I've took it up but we're doing<br>things like that as well<br>um there's also just been a global<br>effort towards hepsi elimination<br>um so we've we've joined a Polaris<br>collaborator Group which is a Global<br>Group looking at hep C elimination so we<br>did some work to find out how many<br>people in the world do we think of guy<br>hep C you know how many people a year<br>are being treated how is the world<br>tracking towards elimination so there's<br>been quite a lot of work in that<br>the key thing though that I would like<br>to leave you here with here is the top<br>thing in the last 10 years now 13<br>million people have had hep C treated<br>with direct acting antivirals that's<br>huge because the impact of that on those<br>people on their funnel on their health<br>on their health system costs is enormous<br>and you know eventually we'll get to<br>elimination<br>so for heaven over sea<br>started off as this non-a non-b virus in<br>1989 they worked out what was causing it<br>it was hep C and they gave it a virus<br>title<br>we've done this big long journey through<br>horrible drugs trying to understand the<br>virus how can we target it what can we<br>do about it<br>and you know now we have a goal of<br>eliminating this virus from the world<br>there's only taken 30 years which is<br>actually pretty good<br>autoimmune hepatitis I mentioned before<br>it's still only halfway along that's the<br>value of research though<br>so just for finally what I'd like to say<br>is I think that targeting unmet medical<br>need is the best motivation for medical<br>research<br>it's really motivational it keeps you<br>going when it's tough because it's not<br>always easy<br>I think power Partnerships are really<br>really powerful all my work's been done<br>in Partnership it's partnership with my<br>nursing colleagues it's partnership with<br>trial staff it's partnership with<br>colleagues partnership with patients<br>it's Partnerships internationally and<br>that's where our strength has been<br>um<br>I think that cure and elimination are<br>really satisfying endpoints to research<br>so finally I just want to say thank you<br>thank you for coming tonight<br>um thank you to Patron 80 for your<br>support over decades<br>um five decades<br>uh thank you to I want to really<br>acknowledge all the patience because it<br>was a huge commitment for people to take<br>part in these studies to have all their<br>bloods and do all the turning up and<br>that's how we've got there it's been a<br>real partnership with them and all my<br>colleagues and collaborators you've all<br>foreign<br>for those who don't know me my name's<br>David Murdock I'm the vice Chancellor of<br>the University of antagonist absolute<br>pleasure to be here today here to hear<br>Catherine's talk and also to be back<br>here in Christchurch<br>um I have that was a wonderful talk<br>Catherine and uh just thank you for<br>sharing your journey<br>just the overwhelming impression that I<br>take away from it firstly just<br>what an amazing amount of work that<br>you've you've done not only in terms of<br>quantum<br>but impact and you talk to that gosh for<br>talk about cures I mean just incredible<br>so the impact of your work is is really<br>phenomenal<br>you you're on a fractional academic<br>appointment I'm not sure I've mentioned<br>that<br>um Catherine's not a full-time academic<br>this has been done on a small proportion<br>of her time<br>and I just think that's a real Testament<br>to you it is just makes it even more<br>amazing<br>it's integrated into the health system<br>this is research this is impactful<br>research globally it's come a lot of<br>from well the New Zealand Health System<br>and I think it's a good reminder of the<br>strength of places like here in<br>Christchurch where the clinical research<br>is so good the opportunities to do<br>clinical research that is absolutely<br>World standing so really Captain you've<br>shown that<br>um<br>and I guess the other impression your<br>humility<br>I absolutely agree with Trish this<br>promotion was well overdue I think<br>you're you're very understated but what<br>you've done is just incredible and you<br>brought back a few memories<br>um you know when I was on infectious<br>disease training during the interferon<br>era remember that very well it was<br>pretty depressing really<br>um also Trish and I ran a clinical trial<br>here during the Canterbury earthquake so<br>I think we can a lot of memories of<br>breaking into the Red Zone to try and<br>get out get our drugs and negotiating<br>with Singaporean military to get into<br>anyway it was a really challenging time<br>and it was amazing and particularly the<br>participants I remember just to you know<br>we're just you know how we managed to<br>keep that going it was a lot of hard<br>work so I can appreciate that<br>I have um so big big thank you big big<br>thank you for sharing your journey with<br>us and I have two other tasks which is<br>really to thank you all for coming along<br>today<br>uh and also just to invite you all to<br>join us in the foia to share some some<br>light refreshments and I think the<br>protocol is that I will lead the way out<br>but I think we just need one more um uh<br>Applause acknowledge Catherine for a<br>wonderful talk</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
