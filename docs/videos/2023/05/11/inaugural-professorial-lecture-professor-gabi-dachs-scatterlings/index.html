welcome you to Professor<br>Gabby Dax inaugural professorial lecture<br>I'm very privileged to be able to attend<br>um<br>the inaugural professorial lectures in<br>the division of Health Sciences it's<br>always exciting to learn more about the<br>life and work of the amazing people who<br>work for us all over the country not<br>just in Dunedin where I'm based so it's<br>just a real pleasure and privilege to be<br>um professors Dex is going to be<br>introduced properly by other people but<br>I just wanted to note that she's a<br>research Professor which means that she<br>has demonstrated<br>sustained outstanding leadership and<br>competence in both research and service<br>so as well as being a middle-winning<br>researcher she's also contributed to the<br>university including through teaching<br>which is not necessarily usual for<br>research professors<br>um contributed to her discipline the her<br>professional community and the general<br>Community through a lot of community<br>engagement and education about her field<br>cancer<br>her promotion is Testament to her<br>exceptional work and dedication and I'm<br>really looking forward to learning more<br>about her journey as a scattering<br>um I'd want to particularly welcome her<br>husband Andy<br>um and her her daughters Nikki and Laura<br>and Sons Daniel and Ryan<br>um her friends Beverly and David and any<br>other family and friends who are either<br>here or watching online<br>so my task is simply to welcome you and<br>pass you on to Professor Martin Kennedy<br>to introduce Professor Dax properly so<br>again I say welcome<br>as uh Professor Priester said it's my<br>pleasure to it's it's my role to<br>introduce Gabby and flesh out a little<br>bit more about her before she then tells<br>us all about her career and research and<br>life story so it's an honor to welcome<br>you all here today<br>and it's also a pleasure to see Gabby's<br>family in the front row there they've<br>shared this journey with Gabby and I'm<br>sure they know that very well and I<br>think I've seen a few of you in Gabby's<br>office over the years so it's nice to<br>see you all grown up and and here today<br>um<br>inaugural professorial lectures are a<br>really special occasion<br>um it as as Professor priest has said<br>the bar is set very high to become a<br>research Professor<br>um and uh in my view it's more like a<br>pole vault than a high jump uh and<br>Gabby's managed to do that very<br>effectively<br>um I don't want to steal her Thunder but<br>I'll tell you a little bit about her she<br>was born in Namibia and did her BSC<br>honors and microbiology at University of<br>Cape Town in 1988<br>um PhD in microbiology at the same<br>University in 1992 and then moved to the<br>UK and had a postdoctoral period for<br>three years in at the MRC labs in<br>deadlock and then moved into a scientist<br>role at the gray Institute cancer<br>research institute at Northwood not too<br>far from London and she spent seven<br>years there before joining us around<br>about 20 years ago<br>in the department of pathology then<br>Department of pathology and started as a<br>research fellow and now here she is<br>today having made that final high jump<br>and we hope she'll be with us for quite<br>a long time to come<br>um<br>I think so over this past 20 years Gabby<br>served as a co-principal investigator<br>for the the large Mackenzie cancer<br>research group<br>um probably our largest group of cancer<br>researchers<br>um uh she's a highly collaborative<br>researcher she collaborates locally<br>nationally and internationally and I'm<br>sure you'll hear a little about that<br>um people like working with Gabby<br>because there's a lot of collaborators<br>she's also a very popular and sought<br>after postgraduate supervisor and she's<br>supervised around about 20 postgraduate<br>students 10 of whom are phds some of<br>those still in process and I'm sure are<br>here today she's also supervised 17<br>summer students which is a pretty<br>impressive tally<br>um she has as you know a sustained and<br>outstanding level of research<br>productivity and we can measure that in<br>lots of ways but she did receive the<br>University of otago Christchurch gold<br>medal for research in 2021<br>um she received the Robin's Fraser<br>research support reward in 2019 and a<br>UIC teaching award or university of<br>otago Christchurch teaching award in<br>2015. she's won over five million<br>dollars as principal or co-principal<br>investigator in external grants and has<br>contributed to other grants to the value<br>of about 14 million dollars<br>and all of that has led to her<br>publishing 80 papers across a range of<br>disciplines almost all related to cancer<br>and she's her papers have been cited<br>four and a half thousand times or<br>thereabouts which tells you how much of<br>them actually has made internationally<br>she's worked on gene therapy effects of<br>low oxygen or hypoxia and vitamin C and<br>again I'm sure we're going to hear more<br>about that very shortly one of your<br>papers has been cited nearly a thousand<br>times and she has about 10 papers that<br>have been cited more than 100 times so<br>these are these are very impressive<br>figures<br>so not only is Gabby an accomplished<br>researcher with an international<br>reputation as a colleague colleague I'd<br>say she's very proactive very supportive<br>very positive and she's a lot of fun so<br>um uh I'm going to finish with a very<br>brief anecdote which tells you something<br>about Gabby Gabby and her family I<br>believe have some animals on their on<br>their lifestyle block<br>and that includes the chicken the<br>chickens and a horse and I can confirm<br>indeed the chickens exist and I remember<br>through the covert lockdowns and a zoom<br>when the startling Gabby was really<br>looking very relaxed on a sofa and too<br>glorious and quite extroverted chickens<br>marched along the back of the sofa which<br>caused everybody to crack up I'm very<br>pleased to report that the horse didn't<br>try and do something similar<br>so Gabby we look forward to your<br>professorial lecture and hearing about<br>your research your career and your life<br>Journey so over to you thank you<br>Namibia a whole<br>foreign<br>Kia Ora<br>I'd like to start off with acknowledging<br>this beautiful quarterway thank you sus<br>and thank you Auntie marujo that is<br>beautiful<br>I feel very privileged to be wearing<br>this<br>so you might have noticed the music on<br>your way in that song that is close to<br>my heart<br>we had good times with it at um in Cape<br>Town as undergrad students in a very<br>crowded low sea-linked stuffy students<br>union bopping up and down with live<br>music in front of us<br>so it brings back memories but it also<br>is quite relevant to<br>my journey through research<br>and also Journey from leaving Africa<br>it is about displaced people from Africa<br>and it's originally obviously for the<br>black South Africans during apartheid<br>but it is<br>um<br>it's more General than that because<br>Humanity has started in Africa and the<br>song itself makes reference to the<br>alduva gorge in Tanzania where<br>supposedly the first human remains are<br>from<br>so I give you a moment to reorientate<br>yourself<br>this is the globe with<br>um so as Martin has already pointed out<br>I was born in Namibia<br>um<br>then moved to Cape Town in South Africa<br>um and then did postdoc in the UK and<br>so I thought I'd give you a little bit<br>of a background where I'm from what my<br>whakapapa is it's German<br>although my grandfather and my mum's<br>side was born in Saint Petersburg I<br>think they were only there for a short<br>period of time and then returned to<br>Germany but he then immigrated to what<br>was then German South West Africa<br>and they worked in a a diamond mining<br>town called Coleman's copper on the<br>southern border of um<br>of Namibia<br>and the way he met his wife also a<br>German immigrant and my mother was born<br>in Coleman's Clippers so that does these<br>houses here it is now ghost town and<br>it's very popular with photographers and<br>tourists because the<br>um the Namib Desert is taking over the<br>area<br>my father and family are from Germany<br>when he was 18 he joined the wehrmacht<br>in 1944<br>um and got sent East into Russia<br>where he was captured and spent five<br>years as a prison of War<br>um following that so this is my father<br>here<br>he and his brothers left Germany and<br>came to South East Africa<br>so what you can see this strange looking<br>concoction in the middle here is an<br>indication of what Namibia was then like<br>it was like the fifth province of South<br>South Africa and it had alongside of it<br>the apartheid laws and all of that that<br>so this is a picture of Namibia<br>not all of it obviously looks like this<br>and this is etosha pan up in the north<br>area Wise It's a little bit smaller than<br>Canterbury but not much it's a huge area<br>so etosha Pan the Wildlife Park<br>Namibia itself is three times the size<br>of New Zealand and it's got about half<br>the population so it's pretty sparsely<br>populated<br>so this is the outline of Namibia um<br>foreign<br>so this year's the coastline along here<br>and the coastline was about 70<br>kilometers of pure desert which I<br>thought until I was an adult that all<br>coastlines looked like that and that you<br>don't have green stuff growing anywhere<br>near the coast<br>um vintuck is right in the center here<br>that's where I was born<br>and Natasha pan is up here<br>so what got me into science well I was<br>always into animals<br>and biology<br>and then slightly more recently into<br>chemistry<br>so I'm following 13 years of school with<br>ABI tour as the school send off I went<br>to Cape Town the University of Cape Town<br>at that point Namibia did not have any<br>University so virtually everybody who<br>went for tertiary education went to<br>South Africa one of the universities<br>there<br>my brother and I started University the<br>same year and we were the first in our<br>whana to get tertiary education my mama<br>my mum was a bookkeeper my dad was a<br>carpenter<br>um and as I said Namibia was the fifth<br>province of South Africa so we had<br>apartheid it was quite a traditional<br>conservative country although in the<br>last year of school our eyes were open<br>somewhat as to what was happening in the<br>world<br>but certainly the first few years at UCT<br>opened my eyes a bit more<br>we had UCT was one of the centers of the<br>anti-apartheid movement<br>police and army coming onto campus quite<br>regularly this is a picture which I<br>actually recall very clearly where they<br>came onto campus and<br>tear gas was was fired into the library<br>so we made a very Hasty exit at that<br>point<br>and left<br>so it was certainly interesting times<br>and it widened my eyes to what's<br>happening in the world<br>so on to a bit more science now<br>so I did my PhD at UCT as was said<br>I'm not going to go through with you<br>exactly what my PhD was about because I<br>can't remember most of it<br>but it started my my love for looking at<br>low oxygen conditions so I was working<br>with an obligate analogue called<br>bacteroidis fragilus which is very<br>important medically because if you have<br>a<br>infection with bacteroides it can be<br>very very severe and it gets usually<br>treated with a drug called metronidazole<br>which only works under low oxygen<br>conditions<br>so these anaerobic bacterium<br>find oxygen is toxic to them<br>so this strange looking beast on the<br>bottom right here<br>was the anaerobic<br>chamber that we used and that I used as<br>a student so you came into the room and<br>usually had the arms out because there<br>was internal pressure of gas sticking<br>out<br>the atmosphere in there was controlled<br>with a Palladium Catalyst and hydrogen<br>and that removes any trace of oxygen<br>but I also found out that if the<br>hydrogen wasn't regulated to the right<br>level and somebody opened the door and<br>it reacted with the oxygen of the<br>atmosphere<br>it was a flash it was quite scary<br>so this piece of Kit<br>was actually the anaerobic chamber was<br>the first thing that I bought or that we<br>bought when um I came to the UK<br>so a quick thing about oxygen levels as<br>I said this is my great Fascination and<br>the bottom that long graph here shows in<br>a log scale<br>oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere<br>or<br>often it's calculated out because we're<br>working in tissues as well so the air<br>that we breathe around here has about 21<br>percent of oxygen<br>and then the pulmonary vein in the body<br>is around about 13 oxygen so it's a bit<br>lower<br>and then all the different organs in the<br>body have different levels of oxygen in<br>them so kidney for example has a range<br>for about two to nine<br>calculated out uterus is quite low<br>and then when we come further down most<br>tumors have areas of very low oxygen and<br>they can range from point one to one<br>percent and even areas with no oxygen<br>containing at all and then the anaerobic<br>bacteria was talking about<br>um bacteroes fragilus needs zero percent<br>oxygen in order to survive<br>so I'm working my my whole career really<br>was was centered around this area<br>and I'll be telling you a bit more about<br>it<br>so as I said as a postdoc<br>um Andy and I moved to the UK<br>without a job at first we find our jobs<br>when we were over there and it was quite<br>hair-raising<br>um so this beautiful picture here is the<br>ditkat power station<br>and this is near where I worked the MRC<br>at Harwell<br>usually when MRC Howell had any sort of<br>conferences on they put pictures of<br>Oxford and the spiers up<br>so this was my post-doc research<br>how do human cells sense and respond to<br>low oxygen levels<br>why is that important<br>first of all I'll start with that<br>because patients with hypoxic tumors<br>have a poor survival<br>so this is not my work this is um it was<br>done before me<br>and this is an example here showing how<br>that work was done basically there's an<br>oxygen electrode that can be inserted<br>into tumors in patients and oxygen<br>concentrations are measured in a<br>stepwise fashion throughout the tissue<br>and from that data these graphs here<br>were created so on the y-axis we've got<br>the percentage overall survival and then<br>on the Y on the x-axis the follow-up in<br>years<br>and what this shows is that tumors<br>that have less hypoxic areas<br>and those patients actually fared better<br>compared to the ones that had more<br>hypoxic tumors and that's why looking at<br>hypoxia and cancer is really really<br>important<br>so tumors because they grow fast and<br>because they have an aberrant kind of<br>growth factor stimulus often have<br>inadequate blood supply and in this<br>picture here again is not mine you can<br>see like areas where you can't see any<br>of the vessels this is a vessel cast so<br>vessels were infused with a reagent that<br>could then solidify<br>and at the same time because tumor cells<br>grow rapidly and they consume a large<br>amount of oxygen the oxygen goes down<br>so that then results and this is a<br>beautiful picture from my student Linda<br>bus<br>um showing<br>in picture form this is a section<br>through a tumor and you can see in green<br>the areas that are hypoxic in blue areas<br>that are perfused<br>and in red where the blood vessels are<br>so you can see that around the blood<br>vessels in by and large you have areas<br>that are well perfused well oxygenated<br>whereas at a distance you have areas<br>that are very much viable these are very<br>much alive these cells but they are low<br>in oxygen<br>and that then means they upregulate cell<br>survival Pathways and one of the<br>important factors in those cell survival<br>Pathways is the hypoxia inducible factor<br>which is very close to my heart and I'll<br>so in my postdoc<br>um research this was the area I was<br>particularly looking at the epoxy<br>inducible factor and it controls gene<br>expression so here's just a picture of a<br>DNA strand and what if which is what I'm<br>going to call it pronoun does it binds<br>to it and then increases expression of<br>the genes that are adjacent to that<br>so the way that we um kind of proved and<br>confirmed that is we had the area that<br>the hip Factor binds to there's a short<br>sequence of DNA that it that it<br>recognizes called the hypoxia responsive<br>element we had that adjacent to a<br>reporter<br>so when his bound to that short sequence<br>the reported Gene was expressed and we<br>could<br>find that and measure it<br>so what this picture on the right here<br>shows is that as oxygen levels go down<br>so we have normal oxygen concentrations<br>here going right down to anoxia versus<br>fold increase in gene expression the<br>more hypoxic the cells were the more we<br>have that reported Gene coming up and<br>interestingly there's a difference even<br>between just gassing with nitrogen and<br>absolute anoxia so this system is really<br>sensitive for very very low oxygen<br>concentrations<br>so what<br>it's really important for tumor growth<br>so this we showed by implanting Mouse<br>tumors into mice so we had one set of<br>tumors which were just normal wild type<br>they had everything that a normal tumor<br>cells have and then we had one where hip<br>was mutated so the hip was not<br>functional this<br>um<br>survival pathway could not kick in when<br>the tumors found themselves under low<br>oxygen<br>and then when you looked at the growth<br>of these tumors on the left hand side<br>here we've got the ones that are able to<br>respond to low oxygen and the tumors<br>grew rapidly in these animals<br>and when the mute when the hip was<br>mutated they grew much slower so if you<br>think about that as a possibility for<br>patients if we can slow down tumor<br>so this area of research<br>has made quite a lot of headlines the<br>person that we collaborated with in the<br>UK<br>Peter Ratcliffe is one of the three<br>recipients of the Nobel Prize a few<br>years ago<br>for the finding out exactly how cells<br>respond and sense oxygen and my Works<br>played some minor role in that discovery<br>so this is how it works sorry this is<br>going to be a little bit heavy as<br>um so<br>what<br>this work has discovered is that there<br>are enzymes these enzymes are catalysts<br>that<br>you know do things in cells so they we<br>just call them PhD and fih and what they<br>require is they require oxygen in order<br>to function they require a bunch of<br>other things which I'll also be talking<br>about<br>so when these enzymes are active<br>they take the hif which I've already<br>talked about and modified they're<br>hydroxylated and when hif is<br>hydroxylated it gets set on a path to<br>destruction<br>so in normoxic cells and cells that have<br>normal amount of oxygen hiff is<br>destroyed and cannot function<br>however if you have low oxygen<br>conditions<br>these enzymes are not active this builds<br>up<br>and then activates a huge number of<br>pathways<br>survival Pathways that allow tumors to<br>grow to spread to grow their own blood<br>supply but they also are involved in<br>resistance to therapies like<br>chemotherapy radiation therapy so when<br>hif is up these tumors are aggressive<br>and that is all because these enzymes up<br>here<br>so I'm leaving out a big chunk here<br>which um basically don't fit into the<br>story a stick I'll stick with the<br>hypoxic theme<br>so in 2003<br>we decided to immigrate to otatahi we<br>came here for a visit and we found that<br>it's a beautiful beautiful country with<br>friendly people and I could see that we<br>could have a work-life balance in this<br>country which was really hard in the UK<br>where you spend at least two hours a day<br>in traffic trying to get backwards and<br>foils<br>yeah so one thing that we did quite<br>recently in hindsight we should have<br>done that much much earlier we did a<br>survey<br>in patients with cancer<br>and we asked them what would they like<br>us to do research on what's important to<br>people that live with cancer<br>um<br>what's important<br>um so we questioned 204 participants<br>and they included both patients with<br>cancer and their father<br>and we asked them a range of questions<br>what we found is that<br>virtually all of them found that cancer<br>research as a whole is really important<br>to high or very high priority<br>we gave them<br>a long list of keywords to choose from<br>which they find you know they had to<br>tick which ones were important<br>and cancer screening quality of life and<br>Maori Health were keywords chosen most<br>often by the participants<br>we also asked them to write down in<br>their own words what we should do<br>regarding cancer research<br>and it became very interesting when we<br>looked by ethnicity so we had enough<br>Maori participants to draw some<br>conclusions from this<br>um and interesting Maori participants<br>were very interested in getting answers<br>to their questions regarding<br>complementary and alternative and<br>holistic therapy<br>as well as access to care non-maori<br>participants were very interested in<br>cancer risks and causes and early<br>detection and screening all of these are<br>areas that are very important and that<br>we actually work in in the Mackenzie<br>cancer research group<br>so<br>complementary and alternative medicine<br>include for example vitamin C and here<br>we've got a beautiful picture of vitamin<br>C under polarized light it was a<br>beautiful<br>um<br>small tiny little molecule<br>so why am I interested in vitamin C how<br>does that fit in the story<br>you might not have spotted this but one<br>of the cofactors that's required in<br>these enzymes that can sense low oxygen<br>is Vitamin C without vitamin C<br>the enzymes will come grind to hold<br>because the the ferrous iron in the<br>active Center becomes oxidized and they<br>stop functioning so if we have vitamin C<br>coming in they can get turned over and<br>so why do we need Vitamin C is this a<br>quick overview for those who don't know<br>most vitamins most animals can make<br>their own vitamin C so your rabbit and<br>your horse and your chicken they can all<br>make their own vitamin C usually in the<br>liver<br>but we together with a few other animals<br>have got a mutation in that pathway<br>for example guinea pigs humans and<br>zebrafish we all need Vitamin C from our<br>diet<br>so we measured vitamin C in cohorts of<br>patients with cancer<br>and the outcome was quite interesting<br>so we had here this is work done by some<br>students over several years<br>these summer students were medical<br>students so they were fantastic at it<br>and they recruited patients that were<br>either pre-surgical so early in their<br>cancer journey and they were about to<br>have the tumor removed<br>or they were further along the pathway<br>so they were receiving chemotherapy<br>so they were recruited in the<br>Christchurch Hospital chemo Suite<br>or they were getting one of the newer<br>types of targeted Therapies<br>immunotherapy<br>and it's interesting to see that we're<br>looking at Vitamin C on there and y-axis<br>here so healthy vitamin C levels in your<br>blood around about 70 80 micro molar up<br>to 100 micro molar you can see these<br>individual dotsia or all individual<br>patients<br>this is a huge range in all of these<br>three cohorts but if you look at the<br>little red line that's the the median so<br>the the midpoint and with these<br>increasing more<br>um<br>complex treatments the vitamin C in<br>these patients was lower and lower and<br>lower<br>and if you look also at the bottom here<br>for example the immunotherapy patient<br>they have a<br>a large group of patients that are very<br>low in their vitamin C in their in their<br>circulation and these patients are<br>so we were interested not looking at in<br>blood but we wanted to see what actually<br>happens in the tumor and we have<br>marvelous<br>um<br>treasure here in Christchurch the Cancer<br>Society tissue Bank and this is just<br>showing how we get tissue samples that<br>we can use for research<br>so the cancer is removed in surgery<br>um by the surgeons and it gets sent to<br>the anatomical pathology where a<br>pathologist is able to select a piece of<br>tumor that is Surplus to diagnostic<br>requirements because we do not want to<br>interfere with anything like that<br>the example he has shown is a bowel<br>cancer<br>with the normal mucus around it and the<br>tumor in the center here<br>and the tissue Bank only needs a tiny<br>little sample and we need an even tinier<br>sample so it's the size of a pin prick<br>shown here in order to measure vitamin C<br>in these tumors they get ground to a<br>fine powder in liquid nitrogen under<br>very very local<br>temperature and then a machine called an<br>hplc can exactly measure the vitamin C<br>in that tumor sample and this is an<br>example of a picia<br>is the gold standard used for measuring<br>this very unstable small molecule<br>so what did we find out we have looked<br>at numerous types of tumor<br>we looked at brain cancer breast cancer<br>kidney bowel and cancer of the uterus<br>I'm using the heterang or tapu Cancer<br>Society tissue Bank samples and we had<br>about somewhere between 50 and 100<br>samples from 50 to 100 patients in each<br>of these types of cancer<br>and I will just summarize what we found<br>I'm showing brain cancer here as an<br>example<br>so on the y-axis is the amount of<br>vitamin C or scobet that we measured in<br>the tissue<br>and here we compared tumors that were<br>either low-grade or high grade high<br>grade tumors are more aggressive they<br>tend to metastasize more easily<br>and we found that the tumors that were<br>more aggressive had lower levels of<br>vitamin C so that could definitely be of<br>clinical significance<br>we also as you can see again from the<br>individual dots that it varies hugely<br>between patients<br>and what I'm not showing here we also<br>looked at normal tissue not in brain<br>cancer but in some of the other types of<br>cancers where we could get a normal<br>tissue sample<br>um and it was not predictive of what<br>happened in the tumor and we believe<br>it's because the tumor has this really<br>abnormal vasculature and poor diffusion<br>that it behaves differently from normal<br>tissue with regards to vitamin C<br>distribution<br>because we I'm still very much<br>interested in the hypoxic pathway we<br>could also measure the hypoxic pathway<br>in these tissue samples and the exact<br>same ones that we measured as Colbert in<br>vitamin C and and we could find that we<br>could show that the ones that had low<br>Vitamin C had the more<br>aggressive higher levels of the hip<br>pathway the hypoxic pathway and this is<br>exactly as we expected when you have not<br>enough vitamin C to turn over the<br>activity of those enzymes the hypoxic<br>pathway is able to come up and activate<br>and then those brain tumors in this case<br>with higher vitamin C had lower levels<br>of<br>could that be important so we are able<br>to do Association studies with these um<br>samples because we have ability to do a<br>so in this case again I'm sticking with<br>the brain cancers which is the most<br>recent work we've done in glioblastomas<br>which is a very aggressive type of<br>cancer<br>here again we're looking at the<br>probability of survival on the y-axis<br>versus the years follow-up<br>um<br>so patients with a low hip score an<br>indication of a less aggressive tumor<br>had slightly better survival if you look<br>at the green curve here and the ones<br>that are high if school had a poorer<br>survival they don't separately hugely<br>but they do separate and it's a good<br>indication that this could be important<br>and we also did the same thing with<br>vitamin C<br>so the patients that had low Vitamin C<br>in the tumors this is not circulating<br>vitamin C it's in the tumor in the Reed<br>here had really poor survival the ones<br>worth higher vitamin C has slightly<br>so they lived slightly longer<br>as far as the glioblastoma tumors go<br>we've also found similar things when we<br>looked at patients with breast cancer or<br>with bowel cancer<br>so there is something happening<br>but<br>this is an association this is not a<br>proof of causation<br>so this is one of my favorite graphs of<br>all time<br>this is a association between the<br>chocolate consumption in the country<br>versus the number of Nobel prizes that<br>country has won<br>so the countries that consume a lot of<br>chocolate like Switzerland have a lot of<br>Nobel prizes coming their way so<br>one may draw your own conclusion but no<br>it's obviously not a causal relationship<br>so if we want to work any further with a<br>vitamin C story we need to look at<br>if we change vitamin c does it actually<br>make a difference<br>and we've done we've completed one small<br>clinical trial and we are about halfway<br>through another small clinical trial<br>where we're looking at whether the Inc<br>if we increase the amount of vitamin C<br>a difference to the biology at least of<br>that tumor<br>so this study was done in patients with<br>bowel cancer where we got a tiny little<br>sample during colonoscopy<br>and then the patients were randomized<br>into either treatment group or control<br>group<br>treatment group received four days worth<br>of high-dose vitamin C infusion<br>75 grams per day this is a really<br>seriously high dose infusion which is<br>what's normally used by the alternative<br>practitioners out in the community<br>and then we got a sample at resection<br>and we could measure both the ascorbet<br>the vitamin C before and after and we<br>could also look at the the hip pathway<br>so this is just shown here<br>in a pictorial form so this is an<br>example of a a bowel tumor with<br>the background here the normal mucosa<br>which is the normal tissue<br>and at biopsy the tumor and the butt and<br>the mucosa were of similar vitamin C<br>concentration these were actually<br>measured I'm just showing it here in<br>color and at surgery we could sample<br>across the tumor from the outside of the<br>tumor towards the center and we could<br>show that the center which is poorly<br>vascularized<br>also has the lowest vitamin C which<br>makes sense because vitamin C gets<br>consumed and it doesn't enter the area<br>which has a poor vasculature<br>the patients that received infusion<br>looked similar at the bobsy stage but<br>when they had the four days of high dose<br>infusion we could increase vitamin C<br>concentrations but very much still there<br>was that gradient across the tumor with<br>the outside of the tumor getting more<br>versus the inside of the tumor getting<br>less<br>here we could show that with the<br>infusion<br>on the right hand side here in being the<br>normal mucosal tissue is very low but we<br>can increase<br>um the amount of vitamin C across from<br>the outside to the center<br>and the amount of the hip score<br>followed the same pathway<br>my many years of work has shown that<br>hypoxia drives a complex survival<br>pathway in tumors that enables cells to<br>grow and to avoid therapy<br>vitamin C is low in many patients with<br>cancer and also in tumors and<br>specifically parts of the tumor that are<br>low in oxygen as well<br>and that enables an aberrant hypoxic<br>Pathway to be upregulated<br>we've shown that high-dose vitamin C<br>infusion May dampen the hypoxic response<br>we do not know yet whether that has any<br>effect on survival of these patients<br>they haven't been treated for long<br>enough or followed up for long enough<br>so what did I learn<br>it's absolutely vital to have a close<br>relationship with clinicians that means<br>we can answer the relevant clinical<br>questions<br>research is important we don't know<br>everything a lot of people think that we<br>know everything there is to know about<br>vitamin C but we do not<br>and that people that live with cancer<br>deserve evidence-based guidelines<br>for their informed choices and that's<br>what we as researchers are here to do<br>and that includes things like<br>complementary medicine such as Vitamin C<br>a picture on the right here I've asked<br>my niece whether I can show this<br>this is my niece's little boy who's<br>currently undergoing treatment for<br>leukemia<br>and it's people like that that we do the<br>research for that we need to make to get<br>answers to them about fundamental<br>questions and that might be of<br>importance<br>I'd like to end up with my special<br>thanks<br>specific things to patients who<br>participated in our clinical trials so<br>far you can see on the left here this is<br>one of our participants getting high<br>dose vitamin C infusion<br>also the participants in all our other<br>clinical studies who answered questions<br>Who provided blood samples thank you<br>very much<br>patients with cancer who have gifted<br>samples<br>Cancer Society tissue bank without them<br>we could not do this research<br>I'd like to thank the nurses and staff<br>at Christchurch Hospital especially<br>those in the chemo Suite endoscopy unit<br>and the OBS and gyne unit<br>and the nurses and staff at Christchurch<br>clinical trials unit across the road who<br>have done the high dose vitamin C<br>I will not be able to mention each and<br>every person who was involved in this<br>work so I'll go through by groups<br>obviously there are a lot of fantastic<br>collaborators<br>so I'd like to first of all thank the<br>highly talented and first fantastic<br>students that were involved<br>the members of my research group the<br>McKenzie cancer research group<br>our<br>clinical colleagues that have been<br>involved my absolutely fabulous Maori<br>advisors<br>um my collaborators far and wide close<br>by as well as overseas<br>um and I don't want to leave out our<br>support staff and some of them are so<br>good at not having their photos online<br>I'm very grateful to the Mackenzie<br>charitable Foundation who has been<br>supporting our group and they're by me<br>since 2010<br>and also the funding support from a<br>range of other external funding bodies<br>across the country<br>they make it possible that we are here<br>and I want to end up with what is our<br>greatest Challenge and that's science<br>funding<br>a challenge for us all because we need<br>our salaries we need our research<br>funding<br>and finally my exceptional mentors<br>throughout the years and I will start<br>with a teacher my biology teacher at<br>high school<br>who'd got me into science and into<br>biology in the first place<br>David Woods who was a fantastic lecturer<br>at UCT<br>my supervisor Vala brat at UCT<br>my postdoc Mentor Ian Stratford who<br>pushed me into giving a keynote lecture<br>a year after starting my postdoc which<br>was terrifying<br>Bridget<br>my clinical Mentor thank you very much<br>you've taught me so much<br>and Margaret my great physics is<br>basically my life coach in all things<br>and who I can go through with all my<br>questions thank you Margaret and thank<br>you Evan<br>and of course my fabulous amazing family<br>I think that's working<br>yep great<br>for those who don't know me my name's<br>David Murdock I'm the vice Chancellor<br>for the University of otago and it's an<br>absolute pleasure to be here today to be<br>back on campus but also to be here at<br>Gabby's inaugural Professor or lecture<br>Gabby and I we've just worked out go<br>back 20 years<br>so I was the head of Department of<br>pathology it was actually my first full<br>year in the job when when Gabby arrived<br>and I do remember<br>news ahead of this hot shot young cancer<br>researcher arriving and asking for my<br>support to appoint her uh to a role<br>remember that very well and I'm so glad<br>about the music I picked the music it<br>just had to be Johnny Clegg and that was<br>this wonderful I was so happy to to hear<br>that<br>um Gabby have really just demonstrated<br>you know an extraordinary Journey I've<br>learned a bit more about you that I<br>didn't know<br>I knew about your research and that's<br>just wonderful to see it all outlined in<br>front of us all I mean it's just been a<br>fantastic journey and I I thought what I<br>could do is just add a few more<br>uh things that may not be so Apparent<br>from your talk and some of them actually<br>have been been mentioned and I think<br>um uh the first is thus you've done this<br>through a really tough environment of<br>research funding you alluded to at the<br>end that was the only time but actually<br>that's and an environment that's doesn't<br>always treat full-time researchers very<br>well and you've really navigated that<br>very successfully but I know that's<br>that's not easy it's not easy at all<br>um<br>you're a really superb your reputation<br>as a as a mentor and a supervisor<br>student supervisor really very very<br>powerful and that's something that I<br>really want to underscore your positive<br>contrary Martin mentioned that your<br>positive contribution to this campus and<br>the University<br>and your thoughtfulness and kindness and<br>I'm actually going to disclose something<br>publicly that I said I'd never do<br>so some of you remember this 2019<br>a few weeks after the Dreadful mass<br>shootings<br>just before Easter<br>people came to work here<br>and the whole building<br>every office<br>there was chocolate<br>in front of every door if if the door<br>was closed there's chocolate outside it<br>was if it was open all of this had<br>chocolate on it<br>and that wasn't all there were posters<br>put up in places of two people one<br>dressed as a chicken and one as a as a<br>rabbit<br>and with sort of holding chocolate this<br>was just posted around in the lifts<br>and as Dean at the time<br>had access to the CCTV footage<br>and the swipe card access at certain<br>times<br>and so um Melissa Peyton and I were able<br>to fully rapidly identify likely<br>culprits<br>and by the way they were waving at the<br>CCTV<br>and<br>I might say that I think both of those<br>people are here in the audience today<br>and one of them may have been the<br>speaker<br>yeah<br>and why do you say why I haven't<br>disclosed it before well I think knowing<br>discovering who they were they're<br>knowing who they were these were people<br>who just did not want to draw attention<br>to themselves personally that was not<br>important<br>and I knew that was the case and so<br>Melissa and I just stayed mum although<br>it may have leaked out in some somewhere<br>but it was such it wasn't the random it<br>was a deliberate act of kindness that<br>was just at that time it just what a<br>difference it made to this campus so I<br>just just as a acknowledge Gabby and her<br>co-conspirator<br>it will remain anonymous but might be<br>able to be worked out<br>um<br>so thank you Gabby for the for the um<br>for this wonderful lecture<br>um really really thank you and I just<br>just want to have two other tasks want<br>to thank you all for coming really<br>important that you're all here and it's<br>just just fantastic and have the family<br>and and friends and colleagues and just<br>wonderful<br>and also to invite you just to um uh<br>join us on the foyer for some light<br>Refreshments<br>um and we can continue this discussions<br>but I just just before we do that and<br>I'll get Gabby's lead us out just I<br>think another round of applause and<br>thank you<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
