lecture of<br>Professor Russell Miller<br>who tells me that he decided to dress up<br>tonight because this was the nearest<br>how do you count fish<br>it's not something that you normally<br>think about when you consider careers<br>that people make<br>probably because fish are underwater and<br>hence out of sight<br>so for your average person the only<br>reason to count fish is to make sure<br>you're not caught more than your daily<br>catch limit and therefore lose your boat<br>however for us all counting fish is what<br>keeps them awake at night<br>sorry I'm a dad<br>turns out the counting fish is really<br>important<br>if you're trying to manage fish fish<br>stocks and allocate quota then you<br>really do need to understand how many<br>fish have different species there are<br>and how they are distributed<br>if you overestimate you could cause fish<br>stocks to nose dive through overfishing<br>if you underestimate people may go<br>hungry<br>to count fish you need to deal with<br>uncertainties how many fishing being<br>born and where how quickly do they<br>migrate and where to<br>how do different fishing methods affect<br>the fish you take from a fishery and so<br>on<br>Russell is a statistician hence<br>uncertainty is as bread and butter<br>applying novel statistical methods to<br>dealing with fish estimates is where he<br>spends his time and in doing so he's<br>made important contributions including a<br>methodology for estimating the birth<br>origins of high speeds high seas salmon<br>determining the right type of fishing<br>gear to catch the targeted size and<br>species of fish and fundamental mental<br>work on incorporating variability and<br>quantifying uncertainty in population<br>Dynamics models of fish stocks<br>has had strong impact enabling the<br>establishment of international<br>conventions for catch of high sea<br>Simmons<br>reduction in a bycatch and discards and<br>spawned the the current stock assessment<br>models used in the management of high<br>value fish stocks globally<br>more recent contributions include<br>validation of a radical trial gear for<br>Humane capture of wild fish<br>Russell did his undergraduate Masters<br>here at the University of Auckland and<br>complete completed a PhD in theoretical<br>statistics at the University of<br>Washington<br>involvement with a salmon management<br>problem in Washington led to an interest<br>in applying Theory to real world<br>problems and he took a research<br>scientist position with the Canadian<br>Department of fisheries and opens oceans<br>in St John's Newfoundland<br>1992 he returned to New Zealand as a<br>lecturer at the University of otago<br>rejoining the University of Auckland in<br>1996.<br>tonight Russell is going to tell us more<br>of his experiences in counting fish<br>this apparently turns the microphone on<br>I think we got it so thanks so much John<br>it's always um it's just real privilege<br>when my boss of bosses the dean of<br>science prepares such a fantastic<br>introduction for me being a state<br>assistant but uncertain whether he wrote<br>it himself or had a scriptwriter<br>well you you stole it and you massaged<br>it and you made it all far better so<br>thank thank you so much John right so um<br>I as you know I left it kind of late in<br>my career to apply for a professor and<br>actually got it the first time I applied<br>but because I left it so late I have a<br>fair breadth of material to cover<br>and and a couple of things I'll cover in<br>a little bit of depth yeah exactly so I<br>better get started right so<br>um yes had a career in quantitative<br>Marine Science so how did that happen uh<br>and I get a better use the computer<br>because I'm using my computer ready to<br>go so what are the early signs of a<br>career in quantitative Marine Science<br>well certainly at an early age like<br>primary school there were signs that I<br>might be quantitative like a math nerd<br>or something like that particularly with<br>that big watch watch protector that I'm<br>that I'm wearing down here<br>um but yeah in terms of Marine Science<br>not so much in terms of indications in<br>fact they couldn't even swim to the<br>other end of the swimming pool at school<br>it's only 50 feet or so<br>I was a western swimmer in my class<br>and then though a few years later<br>my father God bless him he sold the golf<br>clubs and he bought a little trailer<br>sailor<br>a little Hartley 18 called lausanne and<br>so I became I really enjoyed the sailing<br>and unfortunately though I was still no<br>good at swimming in fact I was still<br>scared of the water so even after a hard<br>day sailing I wasn't confident to um<br>jump into the water and have a swim and<br>actually Carl Carl there is you know one<br>of my old oldest friend he was actually<br>better than me at University I never<br>beat Carl any of my assignments or tests<br>or anything so thanks for coming Carl<br>great to see you so a little bit of hint<br>of some involvement in Marine stuff<br>there but I wasn't really until I got to<br>the University of Washington that things<br>changed a bit<br>so the University of Washington<br>fantastic place for kiwis to go to and<br>had good stats school as well but it's<br>got you know fountains and things but<br>it's got Lake Washington to the East and<br>it's got Puget Sound to the west and it<br>has a canal connecting connecting the<br>two and that's Mont Lake cut and the<br>Mont Lake bridge there<br>and a couple of some of the highlights<br>that um I got involved within Seattle<br>was I got exposed to S and S is the<br>ancestor of r which most of you know and<br>basically it wasn't just me in that part<br>of the world there was also Ross Harker<br>and Robert gentleman were in that part<br>of the world and they were using S and<br>basically they developed as a free and<br>open version of yes<br>uh I actually ended up doing many Theory<br>theoretical coursework and also thesis<br>as it turned out we'll get to that but I<br>had<br>Alex I was on an exchange visit a Visa<br>because I got a Fulbright travel<br>scholarship and so I had this J1 visa<br>and for that reason I was actually able<br>to work off campus and so one summer a<br>lecturer tapped me on the shoulder and<br>says would you be interested in going to<br>the Washington State Department of<br>fisheries and helping them with the<br>stats problem<br>so the salmon they all rare in these<br>individual streams and stuff here we've<br>got in there there's so many streams can<br>be a long ways Inland and they can be<br>from British Columbia and Washington<br>State and down here in California and I<br>guess Oregon there but then they get<br>fished at some of them sometimes they<br>get fished out here in these high seas<br>fisheries and of course people want to<br>know you know where these fish come from<br>you know are they my fish you're<br>catching out here are these my<br>Californian fish are catching out here<br>or are you catching an endangered um you<br>know run of salmon out here and say want<br>to know what's the composition of these<br>high sea catches of of salmon<br>and so what they would do is to go to<br>the different natal streams of origin<br>there and they'd collect tissues and do<br>this electrophoresis on them and they do<br>the same thing in the high seas<br>Fisheries this electrophoresis if you<br>remember your genetics and stuff it's<br>all about alleles and things Hardy wine<br>big equilibrium and stuff like that but<br>this this year 10 loci and here we've<br>got like two a double A allele here and<br>this would be a double b allele here and<br>this would be an A B and so you get all<br>this genetic information on these fish<br>from both the individual streams and<br>then also from the high seas Fisheries<br>to do is something like this is a<br>simplified example you um you can't tell<br>for sure which stream the fish comes<br>from based on this genetic stuff but<br>you can look at the frequencies of the<br>alleles in the particular Origins here<br>such as this population one you see that<br>there's a lot of um there's frequencies<br>of the homozygous like<br>alleles there the SS they call them SS<br>and FF there and those are the<br>frequencies and then there's the<br>heterograms zygous one there population<br>A and B and C and<br>with the student we're assuming we have<br>a mixture composed of three populations<br>there and this is the mixed fishery when<br>we sample the mixed fishery these are<br>the little frequencies we see in the<br>mixed fishery and as it turns out if you<br>have 40 of the um mixed fishery comes<br>from population B and 50 from C and 10<br>from a then those that combination of<br>these will give you that so it's a<br>mixture problem where you're mixing<br>these little frequencies from the<br>individual streams to get the allele<br>in this case well that's a pretty simple<br>problem but when I I was dealing with<br>things like there might have been like<br>12 or 14 needle streams and about you<br>know 12 or a dozen loci that they were<br>measuring these these information this a<br>little information and I just happen to<br>be in the I think the right place at the<br>right time I knew how to fit these<br>models it turned out you could fit up by<br>maximum likelihood and in fact I got my<br>first publication after well I was about<br>halfway through my PhD there and the<br>first publication they're actually a<br>very good um very good journal and<br>Fisheries Canadian Journal of fisheries<br>and on the basis of that I ended up<br>doing a very theoretical theoretical PhD<br>because I mentioned to a lecturer I've<br>done some mixture modeling and he said<br>oh I can I can give you a PhD in there<br>and turned out to be a very theoretical<br>one on convergence rates of mixed and<br>models and stuff but I don't mind having<br>done the theoretical thesis because it<br>stood me and it has stood me in good<br>Stead<br>at the University of Washington it was<br>not all work<br>I actually on the Marine side of things<br>I got myself a sharing a little um<br>27-foot sailboat Kelly in 27. I even<br>forgot I had a six-pack back then<br>and I used to charter boats up in the<br>Desolation sound right it's boats up the<br>sailboats up to 40 foot in length and it<br>takes on my colleagues my my fellow<br>students out and do this sailing around<br>distillation sound and I had learned I<br>had taken some swimming lessons as well<br>so I could like jump off the boat and<br>swim some around us feeling fairly<br>comfortable doing that although I<br>couldn't still couldn't swim and I had a<br>motorcycle seat be under CB 750 so I<br>took five and a half years to get my PhD<br>I was in no great rush and I also enjoy<br>cross-county skiing<br>and<br>okay some of you unlike Chris Wilde here<br>might recognize somebody in this photo<br>somebody's been very relevant to this<br>that's Robert gentleman I used to work<br>here that's Robert yes so one of the<br>co-creators of R so Robert at the<br>University of Washington he he got<br>accustomed to kiwis and he realized how<br>great they are also he he met a kiwi<br>girlfriend when he was in Toronto but<br>anyway for those reasons that's why he<br>came to University of Auckland and<br>that's why ah<br>came from University of Auckland he met<br>up with Russell Harker yeah so Ross was<br>one of my peers at the University of<br>Washington<br>so um University of Washington was a<br>great place for me and just a great<br>experience to be spending a few years in<br>another country my thesis was<br>theoretical but I don't mind that I was<br>good at good at math back then but it<br>was motivated by that salmon problem<br>it's just such an eye-opener to be<br>actually we are taking statistical<br>skills and apply it you know in some<br>real world problem where they really<br>cared about it and it made a difference<br>I wasn't quite ready to return to the<br>New Zealand but I couldn't remain in the<br>United States because they had this J<br>visa and they have this two-year<br>Homestay requirements they couldn't come<br>back to New Zealand anyway I'd always<br>enjoyed hopping on my CB 750 and zooming<br>up to Canada and so I thought I'll get a<br>job in Canada and see how it goes and so<br>I ended up going to Newfoundland I<br>remember when I did the job interview<br>and there was the snow was blowing<br>horizontally and hitting me in the face<br>I thought oh wow this is such a dramatic<br>environment this is so cool living there<br>a little bit different but<br>um yeah so um and I had more confidence<br>as a sale I haven't had a little Keel<br>boat and stuff and when what else I can<br>say there and I did yeah I still not a<br>good swimmer but like I learned I<br>learned that I floated floated pretty<br>well so I was getting a bit more<br>comfortable in the water so Newfoundland<br>so I assumed they were in Newfoundland<br>as I say about Newfoundland<br>it's not the end of the world but you<br>can see it from there<br>and Newfoundland actually includes<br>Newfoundland is the island here and then<br>also includes Labrador as part of<br>Newfoundland the quebecers will deny<br>this but actually it is part of<br>Newfoundland Labrador<br>they called the island of Newfoundland<br>The Rock<br>for reasons that will become apparent if<br>I show you a couple of photographs and I<br>was in St John's Newfoundland about<br>there just below St John's as Cape Spear<br>which is the easternmost point of North<br>America<br>only three four hours across the cross<br>to England from from Newfoundland oh<br>that's great that's Greenland there up<br>in the up in the corner there<br>yeah<br>kind of different in Newfoundland so<br>here's a couple of photos that's one of<br>St John's Harbor and there's some houses<br>and some fishing stages up there and<br>some dory's in the harbor mouth there<br>this is actually just a picture from the<br>deck of my house in Winter I'm a little<br>cabin I rented about three kilometers<br>very foggy Place Windy place you might<br>know Newfoundland from that book um The<br>Shipping News Annie Prue 2001 film and<br>um which I'll be mentioning well<br>um<br>well okay<br>um Now The Shipping News 2001 film and<br>it had some big names like Kevin Spacey<br>and Julian Moore Judy Dench Kate<br>Blanchett uh yeah so that's probably<br>what you think of a Newfoundland fog and<br>wind and that's yeah that's um really is<br>what it's like<br>they're Newfoundland I worked at this<br>lab here Lake kittibidi down there this<br>lab had a had like done wet labs for<br>doing experiments on fish and so it had<br>a pumping station down on at the coast<br>and this was the the road down to the<br>pumping station<br>and so every lunch time myself my<br>colleagues wandered down to the public<br>station about 15 minutes walk and would<br>just sit on the rocks and look out over<br>the ocean in this case this is just slob<br>ice here this is some sea ice so she's<br>just Frozen up here and sometimes you<br>see icebergs and stuff like this and<br>whales and stuff we did that religiously<br>every lunch time and this this colleague<br>Ram he he died early<br>prematurely but he was one of the<br>greatest scientists and he appeared in<br>Fortune Magazine was mentioned he really<br>was shaking things up in the stock<br>assessment world but unfortunately he<br>died at a young age of about 55. it was<br>a real privilege to be one of his<br>colleagues<br>uh this is the logi B Marine Lab a bit<br>north of uh where I was stationed but as<br>you can see this is why they call it the<br>and another thing you might know about<br>Newfoundland is<br>the grand Banks Cod Fishery<br>so a bit of History here<br>um this is the 200 mile exclusive well<br>the 200 mile limit<br>and in 1987 there's an international<br>treaty in all the countries got their<br>200 mile exclusive economic zone so<br>prior to that there's been a maximum<br>catch of 810 000 tons of cod in 1968. I<br>mean this all this here is all the grand<br>Banks it's all basically the the<br>continental shelf below 200 meters depth<br>and it's just ideal you know ground for<br>COD<br>and this is the nose and the tail which<br>are outside of the 200 mile exclusive<br>zone so in 1987 the Canadians they got<br>control of the exclusive economic zone<br>and so then they decided yeah we're<br>going to promote the fishery and they<br>subsidize boats for fishermen and so on<br>and they had plans to increase the quota<br>to 400 000 tons and unfortunately even<br>in 1989 which is the year that I arrived<br>there they were having concerns about<br>the state of the fishery and what it was<br>is that the commercial catch per unit<br>effort which is the catch rate<br>like the catch number of cod Court per<br>hour of trawling was<br>um still was was quite high in the<br>commercial fishery but in the research<br>surveys it was quite low it really<br>dropped very low<br>and this is because probably that the<br>commercial Fishers could actually Target<br>fish with their fish finders and stuff<br>and so I remember being in a meeting in<br>Moncton New Brunswick and people were<br>saying oh these two indices don't match<br>up what should we do and and I was<br>trying to figure out what sort of models<br>they were doing here's me thinking<br>maximum like his statistician and<br>they're telling me I'm whipped behind<br>the ears because I didn't understand all<br>this stuff that they were saying about<br>tuning models and stuff<br>or perhaps remember the fishery<br>collapsed in July 1992.<br>and it was the biggest basically<br>industrial closure in Canadian history<br>that's about twice the number of people<br>involved in the New Zealand Fishery<br>and it still hasn't come back every time<br>there's a whiff of cod coming back they<br>open a little fishery a few tens of<br>thousands of tons in there and they pill<br>for it so the cods still haven't come<br>back<br>and it's an example I was on a trawler<br>research vessel in 1989 and yeah we did<br>but I didn't really get into the stock<br>assessment and stock assessment modeling<br>side of things what I got into was this<br>particular thing which is size<br>selectivity and this is where you want<br>to match your fishing gear to the type<br>of fish that you're targeting and so<br>typically you want to catch large fish<br>and then let the smaller ones go so they<br>can breed and they can grow they can<br>they can spawn and they can grow bigger<br>and fatter<br>and so typically you achieve this by<br>specifying the size of mesh or hook that<br>matches the target size for the fish and<br>so here's a retention curve and<br>basically this is the length of the fish<br>here this is the probability that the<br>troll here will retain the fish so as<br>you can see if the fish gets bigger they<br>no longer able to squeeze out the meshes<br>and so the retention is close to one and<br>then the fish are small they can get<br>they can wiggle out through the meshes<br>and someone one of the like the key<br>parameters is l50 which is the length at<br>which the retention probability is 0.5<br>so I suppose it's about 35 centimeters<br>or so for this um this this whatever<br>this this fish in this this troll here<br>so the way that you figure out these<br>retention curves for a particular troll<br>gear is that you've fished the troll<br>gear like the commercial gear here this<br>is a twin trawler because it's got twin<br>twin Cottons or twin trolls and so this<br>would be the experimental gear you're<br>interested in and this would be a<br>control Gear with a really fine mesh and<br>this would catch every fish that went<br>into it and so you compare the the the<br>the length frequencies between the<br>experimental gear and this control cot<br>end that's what's getting did sit down<br>here so I went to a meeting in I think<br>it was in Den uh Holland in The Hague<br>and some Hague actually and somebody<br>presented some results on this stuff and<br>I thought well that just sounds a bit<br>wrong because what they were doing is<br>they had some numbers from the Control<br>Card end which catches everything that<br>goes into it<br>and then they had some length<br>frequencies there so links here and the<br>catch for that you know of that<br>frequency and so they had the um catches<br>of the experimental Cod end and they<br>were saying oh okay<br>um we have here we have 12 fish there<br>were 12 fish went into the control so<br>we'll assume that's the number that went<br>into the experimental it looks like the<br>retention proportion here is 2 out of 12<br>1 6. and here it's um 4 out of 20 uh one<br>fifth you know this is one third or<br>something so doing this sort of stuff<br>okay that's four out of 20 that that's<br>um one fifth and blah blah blah blah so<br>they're calculating their retention<br>proportions this way like you get into a<br>bit of a problem and you get down here<br>where all of a sudden you have oh um the<br>retention probability happens to be<br>um<br>if numbers lining up or not okay I'm<br>sorry I'm just looking at it from Plenty<br>angle um it happens to be<br>down here oh you go oh yeah we caught 97<br>fish out of 92.<br>not a very good proportion so they'd be<br>doing they'd be plotting like this<br>so-called proportion of the experimental<br>versus the Cod end and they were getting<br>plots like this and then they're trying<br>to fit those little s-shaped curves that<br>we saw in the previous slide that go<br>from zero up to one and they go oh well<br>these are proportions supposedly but<br>they're above one so they'd be lowering<br>the data or deleting it or something but<br>it's perfectly good data nothing wrong<br>with the data says every good status<br>session knows<br>if your statistician starts fiddling<br>with good data find another statistician<br>so<br>yeah so I just had a glass of wine or<br>something back at my little crib that my<br>little batch there in the cabin and said<br>something's wrong here and when I<br>thought about it for a while I realized<br>oh I jumped okay so what I realized is<br>that<br>really when you're thinking about the<br>length 50 retention what that means is<br>that for every two fish in the control<br>cot end you'll get one in the<br>experimental cotton because only half of<br>them get caught on average so really<br>what you're looking at when you're<br>scanning this data here is that you're<br>looking sort of at the point where about<br>one third of the fish are actually<br>caught in the in the experimental cot<br>end of that length class the length<br>class at which one third of the total<br>catch an experimental end control is<br>called an experimental<br>so here we have like oh um<br>these these numbers a bit out of I'm<br>looking at it from a funny angle um so<br>here we have<br>um one out of ten one out of ten there<br>and two out of and two out of 22 but one<br>out of ten two out of 22. you look at<br>those numbers they have four out of<br>twenty four out of 24. so that's why you<br>get this ten percent here which is your<br>one out of ten is over here<br>and you're two out of 20 is another one<br>there and the 1 6 there which is your<br>four out of 24. so if you think about<br>the proportion in the experimental cut<br>end out of the total then of course you<br>have a proportion that's between zero<br>and one which is what static systems<br>love about proportions and so you end up<br>with your data like this and yeah you<br>end and so you end up fitting a curve<br>here and from this curve you can<br>actually obtain your retention curve so<br>just as simple as that turns out it's a<br>generalized non-linear model but back in<br>1990 or so this is actually pretty high<br>tech pretty trivial right these days<br>yeah so that's what I was doing that's<br>what I um sort of the slack assessment<br>models were just too complicated so I<br>sort of did this while I was in<br>Newfoundland also I did other things as<br>well and I encountered other experiences<br>one being The Perfect Storm<br>and you have you seen the movie Yes with<br>George Clooney as the skipper of the<br>Andrea Gale<br>and Mark Wahlberg is uh one of the crew<br>and all six on board the Andrea Gale<br>were lost because they encountered this<br>big rogue wave that just overwhelmed the<br>boat right well that's the movie version<br>here's the real version<br>uh it's called The Perfect Storm because<br>I think it was the union of three<br>different storm systems something like<br>that and formed from this perfect storm<br>oh Newfoundland<br>Newfoundlands up there that's where I<br>was yep<br>um so this was one rare rare warm day in<br>Newfoundland where I was able to ride my<br>bike down to the pump station this is<br>the pump station I mentioned that we<br>used to walk down to every lunchtime<br>and um<br>this one day in uh<br>end of October 1991 the people they were<br>going out the door towards the pump<br>station they said don't go down to the<br>pump station today<br>because there was a car park down there<br>and it's been knocked over by a wave<br>and we thought oh we definitely got to<br>go to the pump station so<br>but we actually went into the woods well<br>above the plantation we're hanging onto<br>trees watching the waves do do their<br>things and the waves weren't that big<br>they might have been a few meters tall<br>but they what they didn't look like they<br>were going to kill you but then over a<br>period of 10 minutes we saw a couple of<br>waves and they must hit those Cliffs<br>there right by me which are quite<br>vertical and they just put this big jet<br>of water up into the air and you're<br>talking about 10 tons of water just<br>comes down probably from about this High<br>just comes down 10 tons of water a year<br>would be gone that'll just take you out<br>to see if you're standing there<br>fact<br>then a wave came up this point here it's<br>called small point and it wasn't a<br>terribly big wave but it just didn't<br>stop<br>it must be like a tsunami wave with a<br>big wavelength behind it just didn't<br>stop it just kept climbing that cliff<br>and it got to there<br>on that cliff and A Flock of Seagulls<br>went up into the air and the waves just<br>took out the lower half of the Flock of<br>Seagulls they were just too slow getting<br>off their Roots it was incredible that<br>point there small point is 80 meters<br>high<br>so that wave got to basically the height<br>of North head<br>you've at least got your ankles wet had<br>you been standing on North head here in<br>Auckland<br>so I think there's somebody who's<br>mentioned about never underestimate the<br>ocean yeah and for the first time I<br>appreciate it you know well I have an<br>appreciation for that<br>and that's us the next day or a couple<br>of days later sitting back on the rocks<br>a couple two three meters below where<br>I'm standing<br>but that one day we wouldn't have stood<br>yeah Newfoundland<br>and then after Newfoundland I thought I<br>got something warmer<br>inside<br>Dunedin and I was shocked I was<br>suffering I think from some seasonal<br>adjustment disorder from living in<br>Newfoundland for three years and going<br>to otago certainly didn't help<br>um and so in Dunedin I actually<br>continued the work I was doing on the<br>say cell activity stuff and my most<br>highly cited publication is on the site<br>selectivity stuff it's not even a<br>primary publication in the journals or<br>anything not peer-reviewed nothing out<br>of that it's got 800 sites because<br>whenever anybody does an experiment<br>socio interior fishing gear they cite<br>this publication<br>so I worked on that in in otago<br>then I got involved with some other<br>things some local stuff I'm estimating<br>abundance of toroa at a ready Beach<br>and also<br>um this is the recreational Harvest<br>official log books which you might we<br>might see at the end some results of<br>that and then also my um my good friend<br>Sam who's over there it's great to see<br>you he was down in Dunedin back there a<br>lot of water under the bridge but Sam<br>back then was a better kayaker than me<br>but I can proudly say I think I'm better<br>than Sam right now but anyway I got my<br>kayak and Sam used to take me out and<br>show me show me how to do things in<br>kayaks so on the Marine side of things I<br>didn't do much Marine stuff in<br>Newfoundland because it's just such a<br>nasty nasty the Atlantic northern<br>northern Atlantic is definitely an ocean<br>to be respected but in Dunedin I got my<br>kayak my first kayak my cat Josh there<br>and this is um I was often doing a<br>camping trip in Lake manipuri here and<br>this is somewhere in the Marlborough<br>sounds I think yeah so I bought a<br>southern skewer<br>um kayak and you'll see a few more kayak<br>pictures coming up<br>now<br>so and then<br>after four years in Dunedin<br>I came to the University of Auckland<br>and I bet a lot of you don't recognize<br>this<br>is a tamiki campus one of the buildings<br>at the tambique campus so I was<br>appointed there in 1992. the stats<br>Department had quite sorry 996. uh the<br>stats Department had quite a long a<br>strong representation at the Tamaki<br>campus and I was based there until about<br>um 2010 or something like that<br>and actually bought a house out in Glen<br>Innes or actually Point England<br>um close to that campus and I'm still<br>living there not the same house I moved<br>two doors Two Doors along<br>but I ended up falling in love with the<br>place so about halfway through and so<br>now it's a good time to switch to what<br>I've been doing at the University of<br>Auckland<br>and one of my first major collaborations<br>was with a colleague here at you<br>Auckland Professor Renata Meyer<br>and what happened here is that we kind<br>of I think we legitimately clean that we<br>founded the state space stock assessment<br>methods and so here's a really<br>simplified just like the simplest<br>version of a stock assessment model you<br>can get basically it says that this is a<br>Dynamics equation because it captures<br>the Dynamics of the fishery from year to<br>year it says that you buy a mess next<br>year<br>equals your biomass this year plus what<br>they call the Surplus production which<br>is the fish growing heavier bigger and<br>heavier and also its new Young fish<br>recruiting to the fishery the young the<br>youngsters growing up and getting big<br>enough to catch so that's your Surplus<br>production and then you subtract the<br>catch yeah so you buy a mess this next<br>year it's what you got now surface<br>production oils this also includes<br>natural mortality it's the excess over<br>natural mortality of fish growing bigger<br>and new fish recruiting to the fishery<br>and then minus the commercial catch and<br>here's an equation here for what the<br>Surplus production the simplest<br>representation of the Surplus production<br>function here and these are in these K<br>they're they're parameters that the<br>statistician has to estimate<br>the KX is extra virgin biomass and the r<br>is a sort of the Kennedy parameter and<br>so of course we need some data in the<br>data that we collect is catch per unit<br>efforts<br>and we assume that catch per unit effort<br>is proportional to the biomass if you<br>have the biomass you have the rate at<br>which you catch fish sort of thing and<br>there's some plus some variability and<br>some random variability on your catches<br>of course<br>um so yeah so the status system's job is<br>to estimate these parameters are knq<br>catchability there<br>and the thing is so these models are<br>incredibly dangerous because once you've<br>estimated these parameters and you know<br>what R and R and K are basically you can<br>project the biomass from today out into<br>the future and definitely with absolute<br>certainty there's no variability in this<br>equation here whatsoever<br>very very dangerous equation<br>and no one really believes that to be<br>the case but really they didn't at that<br>time have techniques to do anything<br>better than that<br>we were able to fit models that actually<br>also included some uncertainty in the<br>biodesk biomass Dynamics equations<br>here's some uncertainty because of<br>course there's variability in<br>recruitment<br>some years are good for recruitment some<br>aren't some years are good for growth<br>some aren't depends on the temperature<br>the weather and these sorts of things<br>the availability of prey and stuff<br>and um what so what happened is that um<br>in the 1990s their decisions were<br>started to get excited about this<br>computer intensive Bayesian techniques<br>because previously they've been doing<br>its maximum likelihood stuff that I'd<br>done that you know that genetic the<br>genetics stuff with the salmon that<br>maximum likeliad but this new technique<br>came along<br>and Robert gentleman who we've already<br>talked about a lesson he didn't just<br>create a he also ran this workshop on<br>basically on these new Bayesian<br>techniques and so Renata and I went to<br>these workshops and we realized oh using<br>these Bayesian techniques we can<br>actually fit this model<br>there was a bit of work to do it back<br>then now it's trivial trivial because of<br>the software and so we were able to do<br>that and then we applied it to one of<br>the classic examples that gets used and<br>it's tuna South South Atlantic albacore<br>tuna and some old data from 67 this is<br>the biomass here like the median biomass<br>and 67 I mean it's by a mess on the<br>y-axis here<br>um<br>and so that's 67 1967 down here's like<br>1969 you can see how the biomass reduces<br>but you've got these uncertainty bars on<br>the biomass here and then after 989 I<br>think we projected out under uh the<br>assumption that you're fishing at the<br>so-called maximum sustainable yield for<br>this stock<br>but as you as you can see basically with<br>almost very high certainty this fishery<br>collapses one reason is because there's<br>already fished down too far to maintain<br>the maximum sustainable yield and the<br>other reasons that maximum sustainable<br>yield is a nonsense concept because of<br>all the variability uh in in Fisheries<br>Dynamics it's a bit of a nonsense<br>concept anyway but finally we had a way<br>of really quantifying uncertainty in<br>these Fisheries kind of models<br>you know if they had the sort of thing<br>back you know when I was in Canada<br>Canada and we're doing this sort of<br>stuff yeah the scientists could have<br>could have gone to the managers of that<br>fishery and said like if you cut your<br>quota in half for three years<br>uh then you'll be able to bring you know<br>restore it and have you know have strong<br>fishery or<br>if you just continue with the Quiet race<br>you've got to sit now you've got an 80<br>chance of the fishery collapsing yeah if<br>the scientific you know sort of quantify<br>those kind of risks perhaps would have<br>made a made a difference<br>um to the Grand Banks Cod fishery they<br>just didn't have these these models back<br>then<br>and so Renata and I um we got a couple<br>of um<br>a couple of good Publications out of<br>this<br>um and these are both in 2000 and we<br>also extended them to these a structured<br>models and these are the ones that are<br>used for the Cod the Cod fishery and for<br>things like Snapper and so on the high<br>value Fisheries they actually age the<br>fish they age samples off the fish<br>that way they get to see recruitment<br>pulses coming through get to see the<br>years when there's lots of lots of young<br>ones come through in years when there's<br>not so much<br>um so yeah so we extended it then it was<br>back in 2000<br>um these ideas really didn't get a lot<br>of uptake for a while<br>um maybe because we're in the Ivory<br>Towers or something like that but<br>um in 2006 I did get invited back to<br>Newfoundland to the Department of<br>fisheries and oceans and I gave them a<br>workshop on this stuff<br>and I'm happy to report this on my grad<br>students like um Sam McKinney he's at<br>the Secretariat of the Pacific Community<br>in yumea<br>um Craig and Andrew are both at NOAA and<br>the United States and you're in Seattle<br>and Craig at Juneau Alaska and they're<br>both working on models far more<br>complicated than I've ever done and<br>they're including spatial temporal<br>extensions extensions<br>um that incorporate<br>um because it's spatial temporal they<br>can incorporate effects of climate<br>change like habitat and regime habits<br>shifts and habitat as the fish expand<br>their habitat or reduce their habitat<br>and so sort of getting into back into<br>the getting wet sort of phase up till<br>then all my Marine activity had been<br>above the water<br>uh then I finally started to get under<br>the water and one of those reasons was I<br>did some collaboration with Trevor<br>Willis of the Lee Marine lamp he was a<br>PhD student up there but he was a<br>quantitative well he's a student who<br>appreciated quantitative skills and a<br>lot of people were doing theoretical<br>modeling of marine reserves saying idea<br>the Marine reserve is obviously going to<br>work but very few people were actually<br>Gathering empirical data and actually<br>proving it actually demonstrating it so<br>travel is all about you know getting<br>good experimental designs and showing<br>these things work and so he compared<br>angling just with a rod and a reel and<br>then underwater visual counts and then<br>beta underwater video as ways of<br>counting fish<br>so this is the end of an underwater<br>video<br>um census he's been he's been counting<br>fish and then he just writes down so he<br>swims a 25 meter transect that's why<br>he's got the tape Rail and he's just<br>counting fish as he goes he's just<br>finishing up there so that's one way of<br>doing it but you know Trev discover that<br>you can be swimming along and you see a<br>couple of Snapper and then there's 12<br>Snapper following behind you so they're<br>they're pretty unreliable so what he<br>decided what we've discovered was best<br>was his uh baited underwater videos and<br>here you the number of number of fish is<br>the maximum number you see during the 30<br>minute video which we don't have time<br>for so um I think we see<br>um like there's three perch there's one<br>uh one perched up there and one here and<br>one there and Snapper oh there they are<br>two Snapper there was that um yeah two<br>Snapper there and so you just used to<br>get an undergraduate student watch these<br>videos for half an hour and try to<br>figure what's the maximum number of<br>Snapper I saw in half an hour sort of<br>thing yeah so those are the most<br>reliable way of doing things I was using<br>the baited underwater video and so um in<br>1990 Ian so in 1999 yeah we estimated<br>that inside the Goat Island Marine<br>reserve which is the Cape Point Marine<br>reserves the proper name for it uh you<br>know where the University of Auckland<br>Marine Lab is and it was 11 times of<br>density of fish inside the reserve that<br>Snapper inside the reserve as there were<br>outside the reserve<br>in 2003 we found that to be 16 times<br>more inside the reserve and then also we<br>also there's a seasonal migration of<br>Snapper they move offshore when the<br>weather gets cooler around now and then<br>they come back in in the spring and in<br>the Marine reserves would pick up this<br>big pulse of fish coming back in we<br>didn't pick it up outside the reserves<br>reason being they're getting hammered<br>they're getting fished outside the<br>reserves and so on the basis of that<br>comparison we actually found in some<br>places the fishing mortality was as much<br>as 96 percent<br>now also on the kind of marine getting<br>getting moists kind of side of things<br>Trev got me into snorkeling and Diving<br>so this is me snorkeling a much these<br>are coheroes like like Jack mackerel's<br>here me snorkeling and then I ended up<br>doing these these transects and things<br>myself and counting Counting fish and<br>this is my actually my first time I went<br>snorkeling was on RV Proteus which was<br>the University of auckland's research<br>vessel at the time<br>and then I got associated with another<br>colleague that was Professor Marty<br>Anderson well over at Albany<br>who was at the University of Auckland<br>and with Marty I went I started joining<br>Muddy's dive trips so this is the<br>Proteus which which replaced the produce<br>which replaced the um the Hari which<br>replaced the Proteus and there's now a<br>new boat I think the university has now<br>got to Catamaran so Marty um brilliant<br>um like quantitative Marine ecologist<br>and she started collecting this time<br>series that started in 2000 and went up<br>to 2016. where every single year she'd<br>sample these places along the northeast<br>coast of New Zealand uh Bergen Point<br>home Point Lee and Har hey<br>and at each of these locations there'd<br>be 20 transects at each of four sites<br>and so we have the sites one or the the<br>four different sites there and actually<br>10 of these transects would would be<br>these are these 25 meter transex Swan by<br>divers we had to use divers for this<br>because we wanted to count all species<br>of fish and only the carnivores are<br>going to come to abated underwater video<br>or science we had to do the diver<br>transex<br>um and so 10 of these transects would be<br>in the total Barons which is really<br>shallow water three to five meter and<br>then another 10 of these transects would<br>be in kelp forest which could be down to<br>20 meters so it was very interesting<br>diving I was pretty green when it came<br>to the diving and I tell you after doing<br>this for a few years I could like it's I<br>could spend a lot more time down in the<br>water with the tank of air because<br>you're really nervous when you when<br>you're new and I could barely do five<br>Tran these debt transects I'd probably<br>had no air lift but you know after a few<br>years you get more comfortable but you<br>know you're fishing and you're swimming<br>and Diving and conditions should never<br>be in if you're a recreational diver and<br>these Barons sometimes get big swells<br>you're in three meters of water and<br>you're just it's like you're in a<br>washing machine bubbles everywhere and<br>you're trying to maintain position and<br>count fish so yes an interesting<br>experience<br>um and Marty uh so I also got involved<br>so it was part of part of that and Marty<br>was um had a lot of did a lot of stuff<br>in community assemblages and this sort<br>of stuff so I got involved with a bit of<br>um statistical modeling with Maori and<br>also fertilization of marine<br>invertebrates that's because it's a<br>thing called polyspermy to a point the<br>more the higher the sperm concentration<br>the higher the probability of<br>fertilization but when the sperm<br>concentration gets too high you can get<br>multiple fertilization at the same time<br>and then the gamete doesn't form<br>properly and so it starts going down the<br>fertilization rate so I um basically<br>came up with the model for that and<br>that's relevant to something we will see<br>at the end and other things with Marty<br>and on the sort of marine recreational<br>side of things I sort of parked up the<br>kayak for a while and I got into sailing<br>I had my little boat and I I was I was<br>trimming on a lid guard 29 this is the<br>Coastal Classic to start off devonport<br>Coastal Classic and I also did most<br>Bauman on a young 88 and they made so<br>many mistakes it was embarrassing<br>um yeah so I was um so at least I've got<br>under the water<br>and I also learned that I didn't really<br>need to be a good swimmer as long as I<br>didn't panic<br>and that's such a key when you're diving<br>just don't panic you've got your BCD for<br>your buoyancy doesn't matter what<br>now and they had this collaboration also<br>um from about 2004 I think with this<br>colleague in Australia he is the master<br>of all things gear technology<br>and we did and we're still doing this<br>today but it's like if you want to<br>minimize bycatch the more talented<br>basically the mortality of fish you're<br>not keeping you want to minimize the<br>mortality put it back without killing it<br>hey the the best approach is somebody<br>don't don't bring it on board the boat<br>in the first place<br>so they have a perfect gear that doesn't<br>doesn't retain it but if you do bring it<br>on board then do obvious things like<br>minimize the handling time keep the<br>thing moist<br>um that sort of stuff and then we sort<br>of played around with grids and stuff<br>and a Ted a Ted by the way is a turtle<br>excluder device and we'll have a look at<br>a Ted<br>this isn't our video but we were doing<br>the sort of stuff so here's a shrimp<br>troll has very small mesh because you're<br>catching shrimp<br>so it retains everything and so there's<br>a lot of bycatching these things so why<br>not put a grid in it that flicks up the<br>big animals like turtles and sharks and<br>it flicks them out through this Escape<br>Gap here at the top so all we need now<br>so let's look down here oh that's<br>convenient<br>and this one gets really has a really<br>easy time so we'll better put them back<br>in and see how he does again there we go<br>he struggles a bit more this time<br>and here's the diver's eye view coming<br>up he's actually got a whole Ecology of<br>fish this little turtle he's got some<br>fish hanging around him as well if you<br>look closely and he struggles for a bit<br>then he and his little fish fish buddies<br>and the diver lets them go that time yay<br>well way way to go yeah so those sorts<br>of things so um also you can use these<br>um grids the other way around if you<br>want the little things to go to escape<br>then you have if they get through the<br>grid then they escape otherwise the grid<br>will slip them up into the the capture<br>compared so um yeah they can do it that<br>way too and but you know that's a pretty<br>expensive modification to a trawl but<br>yeah certainly does the job there with<br>these prawn Trolls but you know often<br>simpler modifications<br>um are preferred of course by the<br>fishermen and one is just you know turn<br>them turn a mesh around turn it 90<br>degrees this is a net here on the left<br>there<br>and it's got a bit of tension from north<br>to south put attention if you turn that<br>mesh around 90 degrees what happens is<br>that rather than the braid coming<br>straight out of the knot there it<br>actually comes out at a right angle you<br>turn that 90 degrees and that means<br>under tension that actual mesh will stay<br>open better and it helps fish escape and<br>those are the simple modifications that<br>the fishermen really like so we looked<br>at that sort of stuff as well<br>like and like you catch a snapper and<br>Hurricane Golf it's undersized the<br>Hook's going down you go ah<br>what I do you rip the hook out and you<br>kill the poor thing but we found it's<br>far better just to cut the line and put<br>the fish back because after a few days<br>that hook will actually rust out and the<br>fish has a far better chance of survival<br>so we did those sorts of experiments as<br>well now everyone knows trolls have a<br>really bad reputation for steering up<br>the seabed and doing a lot of damage<br>because they have troll doors in front<br>of them<br>and the troll doors are what opens the<br>mouth of the troll up and so here we go<br>this was this is actually in front of<br>that um in front of that's prawn uh<br>troll we just saw this is what's right<br>in front of it<br>and there's your troll door and as you<br>can see that's got this big silk cloud<br>or sand Cloud behind it<br>um and it's scraping along the sand<br>there fortunately nothing much that it's<br>probably killing and even the bottom of<br>the troll has these Tickler chains on it<br>because you've got you know you don't<br>want the prawn going under there so this<br>troll this um this prawn troll this is<br>the same one that has that um that Ted<br>in it yeah it's scraping along there and<br>kicking up a lot of um a lot of the<br>benthic habitat so Matt and sort of<br>developed these these doors that have<br>less they just slide along leads on<br>sleds but also they have the same<br>hydrated Dynamic Force by having a sale<br>on this on basically like a ski here but<br>the thing you got to remember is that<br>troll door was kicking up all that silt<br>and that was actually herding fish into<br>the troll and so you've got to be aware<br>that you know if you modify a gear you<br>might be losing some of the catch rate<br>and that means you've got to um you know<br>if you're losing catch rate the<br>fishermen have to fish for longer and so<br>you might be negating the benefits of<br>having less drag<br>right and now<br>um with Lindsay white from aut<br>he's just great at interfacing between<br>fisheries and and like New Zealand<br>fisheries and Industry and Academia and<br>so I got involved with Lindsay with surf<br>clams<br>people probably aren't aware of surf<br>clams because they're subtitle<br>and there's seven species there's three<br>of them are shown here<br>um there's the triangle shell which I<br>think is this one here I'm not seeing it<br>very well from my vantage point<br>um there's like a diamond shaped one I<br>think it's a triangle shell there and<br>then we have these ringed ones which are<br>these ones with the Rings and then we<br>have the trough cell which is these<br>bigger ones here<br>um it's such a clean fishery virtually<br>no bycatch there's a few sand dollars<br>there and a couple of worms it's a it's<br>a very very clean fishery because<br>they're fishing in the surf zone the<br>turbulent surf's Zone it's just sand<br>nothing can establish itself there<br>anyway we showed that a Foxton beach in<br>a 35 kilometers of Foxton Beach<br>um that there was 18 and a half thousand<br>tons of surf clams they're buried about<br>yay under the under the surface which<br>means that for every big step that you<br>take one meter step it's 500 kilograms<br>of of clams just in that strip going off<br>shorts 500 Kilograms half a ton every<br>step you take along the beach this just<br>just past another half a ton of surf<br>clamps there's a lot of them out there<br>and the staffs have the potential to be<br>New Zealand's biggest fishery if it's<br>handled well but we unfortunately tried<br>to get funding to develop it you know in<br>these are you know after 10 million<br>dollars bids and stuff but we got very<br>very close but we never quite quite made<br>it there's it's sad but yeah there's a<br>lot of them out there and by the way the<br>Deepwater tuatua is not here because<br>these were probably fished in about six<br>or seven meters the Deepwater tour<br>actually the shallowest species they're<br>called Deep Water tour because they're<br>deep compared to the intertidal tours<br>which are the ones that people are<br>familiar with and this is the dredge<br>hydraulic dredge which cuts into the<br>emulsifies of sand and actually gets<br>these things out of the Sand by<br>squirting here<br>we're getting there and then another<br>thing I did with Lindsay was we looked<br>at gooey Ducks we also have gooey ducks<br>in this country which are about five or<br>six hundred grams each and they're so<br>big the the siphon is so big it can't<br>even retract the siphon<br>and there's uh populations of them<br>around the place and this was done in um<br>golden Bay and we had to work for the<br>seafood Innovation Grant and that<br>requires basically you to estimate the<br>biomass of these things basically within<br>the confines of commercial fishing and<br>so we said well how on Earth can we do<br>this within the confines of commercial<br>fishing turns out the way they do it is<br>someone the diver has an air hose<br>pumped from the boat and we just said<br>hey we need a transect and he says we'll<br>just have them go out to the extent of<br>his air hose and then walk and then<br>crawl on back and and the transit can be<br>the width of his jet his jet nozzle<br>either side of his air hose and that<br>gives us our transect in the area and so<br>this is what it looks like when he's<br>doing this<br>It's really silty because<br>within the transect from the width of<br>his model and he blasted out I think he<br>I think he gets when he puts it in his<br>bag this guy he loves his job he spends<br>two three hours down there non-stop he's<br>just got his own little you know he's<br>his own little world he loves it<br>yeah so we got involved with that and<br>that was more like just common sense<br>nothing really fancy stats there just<br>more kind of Common Sense I've seen that<br>okay here's the last bit<br>um more recently<br>got involved with this troll this new<br>novel troll gear this is what happens to<br>fish in a conventional trawl<br>Snapper here the Bing I say this is<br>Jordan Hall back because the way it's<br>the cuttings hanging vertically but they<br>have a hell of a time they're fighting<br>the current the whole time because the<br>troll is going you know at a good<br>walking pace and the fish are fighting<br>the current the whole time the current<br>the whole time and then they fall back<br>into the back of the net and they get<br>squeezed by other fish it's a hell of an<br>experience for them and this is what it<br>looks like for hokey a big big um Hall<br>of hoti coming up<br>so um with um folks so<br>I finally got into some money well the<br>money the money actually found me<br>um this big 50 million dollar um is sort<br>of a primary growth plan 50 million<br>dollars and it was over a period of<br>several years but it was to develop a<br>humane way of catching fish and<br>basically it's this basically this tube<br>here with a few holes cut out for escape<br>holes<br>and the flow of water in this thing is<br>far far less also the entire back part<br>of this net is just solid there's no<br>holes and there's very little water flow<br>in there so once the fish go back to the<br>back of the net they basically can just<br>hang out there as happy as anything so<br>here's some Snapper in here I mean<br>they're working a little bit but they're<br>actually not not struggling Australian<br>like being all pushed together<br>and here's this um this is hokey and<br>what and so it's a big catch here this<br>Hokie actually come out of this um this<br>this new MHS gear really quite Lively<br>because they're in water they're still<br>in water here on the deck and they're<br>actually jumping around quite a bit<br>so I got involved with this in my job so<br>this gear could be regulated for use in<br>the commercial fishery was to show that<br>the selectivity of this gear was as good<br>as that of the conventional gear so<br>maybe in a selectivity person they came<br>to me and they went they used this twin<br>troll to the rahua 66 meters out in the<br>Chatham rice and we I did some cell<br>activity analysis for them and here's<br>the you saw these curves before you know<br>fit into those proportions I talked<br>about a few minutes ago and this is the<br>curve that we came up with MHS being the<br>modular Harvest system the new one and<br>the dash lines the conventional gear as<br>you can see the MHS is actually slightly<br>better at keeping the big fish which is<br>what we want in slightly better at<br>leaving at not catching the little fish<br>it wasn't significantly different but<br>the indications were there it was just<br>as good so I think my time's just about<br>done what I have coming up there's a<br>whole lot of things I can talk about<br>here but I thought<br>I might if you're interested show you<br>those who are fisher fisher folks<br>Fisheries or here<br>oh the predictive pair of the Maori<br>fishing calendar and lunar phases on<br>catch rates would you like to see this<br>would you like to know when to go out<br>fishing perhaps<br>okay so I had some data both on a diary<br>survey and then some data from actually<br>boat ramps when Department of Fisheries<br>people would go out and those um the<br>Fisheries wardens would go out and<br>they'd actually interview people who<br>brought you know bring in their trailer<br>trailer boat back up the ramp and so we<br>did this oh I forgot to mention I got<br>too Antarctica also<br>um this is due to my fertilization stuff<br>because somebody was interested in the<br>fertilization of invertebrates in<br>Antarctica so we dug a hole and then we<br>put a dip a dip net down and we took the<br>sample back to the to the lab and we got<br>helicoptered out to there from Scott<br>base so yeah that was for a status<br>session that's pretty cool I also got in<br>the kayak to kayak around the kumadec<br>islands I didn't kayak to the camera<br>decks but I went on the supply vessel<br>there the Claymore II that's me and we<br>had we actually got ashore at the<br>coumadex rail Island this is fishing<br>Rock and I tell you getting the shore<br>there's a mission when the swell's up in<br>this way they have you wearing a hard<br>hat and a life jacket you've got to jump<br>off this inflatable into this rock and<br>if you time it wrong you're going for a<br>swim not good and this is me somewhere<br>kayaking from welcome to tairua and this<br>is me crossing the Cook Strait yes I was<br>busy doing these other sorts of things<br>as well but anyway you want to hear<br>about Snapper when to catch snapper here<br>we go<br>yeah so<br>this is the seasonal cycle and Snapper<br>catch rates this is the catch per unit<br>of the catch your Snapper per hour<br>so as you can see it drops down here<br>this is because Snapper go offshore when<br>the weather gets cooler they go offshore<br>and then they come back and Shore as the<br>weather warms up and they um do their<br>bread the spawning and stuff now there's<br>a dip there's a dip you know right<br>around the summer here I'm not sure what<br>that's about maybe they get more<br>involved with wanting to spawn and that<br>becomes their top priority over feeding<br>or it might just be local depletion I<br>wouldn't be surprised that's all they<br>just get hammered by the local Fishers<br>and so the the local abundance gets<br>knocked knocked back so that's the<br>seasonal cycle of these catch rates this<br>is like the lunar cycle and also what<br>the Maori fishing calendar is heavily<br>based on so here's the Luna here's the<br>lunar cycle pattern in Snapper catch<br>rates so as you can see the best time to<br>go out and go fishing for Snapper is<br>between about halfway between the new<br>moon and the first quarter and the worst<br>time<br>is between the full moon and the last<br>quarter so we've got both boat ramps<br>data and diary data but they're so much<br>the same story but the difference<br>between the worst and the best is only<br>about 10 so the take a message of this<br>lecture of my professor of professorial<br>um coronation is go fishing whenever the<br>weather's good and you feel like it go<br>fishing but don't catch too many</p></main><footer
