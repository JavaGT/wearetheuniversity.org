Today it remains the <br>only dental school in Aotearoa New  <br>Zealand and one of only a few brand new <br>dental teaching hospitals in the world.<br>The four-story atrium is the heart of the Dental <br>School. It links the historic Walsh Building with  <br>the neighboring Clinical Services Building. These <br>buildings have undergone extensive renovations.  <br>The modern purpose-built facility provides <br>exceptional teaching and research opportunities,  <br>while giving the community access to high quality <br>dental care. The student commons area provides  <br>students with their own space to study, learn, <br>collaborate and relax. The Faculty of Dentistry  <br>offers a comprehensive suite of programs in <br>dental technology, oral health and dentistry.<br>The dental technology labs are used for <br>teaching the traditional construction of  <br>dental appliances to undergraduate dental and <br>dental technology students. The Faculty teaches  <br>CAD cam design and the milling and 3D printing <br>of dentures, implants and orthodontic appliances.<br>The second floor of the Walsh Building contains <br>staff offices and the simulation clinic. Inside  <br>the simulation clinic, 80 mannequins with <br>removable jaws and teeth enable dental and  <br>oral health students to learn clinical procedures <br>and practice cross infection control measures.  <br>The setup replicates a real-life clinical setting, <br>preparing students for the treatment of patients.<br>Located in Central Dunedin, this world-class <br>teaching hospital is easily accessible to  <br>patients and the local hospital. By providing <br>a service to the community, our students  <br>graduate with a unique practical and technical <br>skill set, making them highly sought after.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
