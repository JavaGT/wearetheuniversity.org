The heritage-listed  <br>Walsh building is an early example of <br>the international modernist movement.<br>The four-story atrium is the heart of the <br>Dental School. It links the historic Walsh  <br>Building with the neighboring Clinical Services <br>Building. These buildings have undergone extensive  <br>renovations. Now housing state-of-the-art <br>dental clinics, operating theaters,  <br>teaching and research laboratories, seminar rooms, <br>a lecture theater, student areas, and offices.  <br>The modern purpose-built facility provides <br>exceptional teaching and research opportunities,  <br>while giving the community access to high quality <br>dental care. The student commons area provides  <br>students with their own space to study, learn, <br>collaborate and relax. The Faculty of Dentistry  <br>offers a comprehensive suite of programs in <br>dental technology, oral health and dentistry.<br>Vitally important to the smooth <br>running of the Dental School,  <br>the Central Sterile Services Department, <br>or CSSD, is where equipment is cleaned,  <br>sterilised and then transported in dedicated <br>lifts to the dispensaries on each floor.  <br>At peak times the CSSD cleans and sterilises more <br>pieces of equipment than Dunedin Public Hospital.  <br>The first floor houses the primary care unit <br>of the Dental Hospital, This is where people  <br>with acute pain, infections and trauma <br>are seen. This floor also contains a fully  <br>equipped operating theater and three procedure <br>rooms for minor surgery. The main radiography  <br>unit houses equipment for bitewing, panoramic <br>and cone beam computer tomography 3D imaging.<br>6 dental chairs are dedicated to the clinical <br>care of children and young adults, as well as  <br>those with special needs. They provide privacy, <br>less distractions and more space for whānau.  <br>The twelve chairs in orthodontics replicate <br>typical orthodontic practice, helping to produce  <br>oral health practitioners with a career-ready <br>clinical skill set. The dental technology labs  <br>are used for teaching the traditional construction <br>of dental appliances to undergraduate dental and  <br>dental technology students. Postgraduate <br>students, particularly prosthodontics,  <br>esthetic dentistry and clinical dental technology <br>students also use these labs. The Faculty teaches  <br>CAD cam design and the milling and 3D printing <br>of dentures, implants and orthodontic appliances.<br>The second and third floors of The Clinical <br>Services Building house the main teaching clinics  <br>for undergraduate and postgraduate students. <br>Each floor contains 80 dental chairs. Arranged  <br>in pods of eight chairs, the layout enables <br>patient privacy and discrete supervision,  <br>with a dental tutor overseeing each pod. Six <br>individual operatories per floor are also  <br>available for more complex procedures. The top <br>of the range dental chairs are fully digitised so  <br>that electronic patient records can be accessed <br>chairside and x-rays and intra-oral camera  <br>views can be shown to the patient. The central <br>light well directs and reflects natural light  <br>into the clinics, helping to provide the high <br>quality lighting needed for dental procedures.<br>The second floor of the Walsh Building contains <br>staff offices and the simulation clinic. Inside  <br>the simulation clinic, 80 mannequins with <br>removable jaws and teeth enable dental and  <br>oral health students to learn clinical procedures <br>and practice cross infection control measures.  <br>The setup replicates a real-life clinical setting, <br>preparing students for the treatment of patients.  <br>The monitors are used to show videos of procedures <br>or tutor demonstrations. Academics' offices are  <br>mostly located on the third floor for easy access <br>to clinics, students and research facilities.<br>The Oral Pathology Center provides oral <br>histopathology diagnostic services to  <br>general dentists, dental specialists and general <br>pathologists across Aotearoa New Zealand. It also  <br>undertakes research that underpins undergraduate <br>and postgraduate oral pathology teaching.  <br>The Sir John Walsh Research Institute comprises a <br>physical containment level 2 molecular biosciences  <br>laboratory and a biomaterials, biomechanics <br>and craniofacial research laboratory where  <br>staff and postgraduate students carry <br>out research to advance oral health.<br>Located in Central Dunedin, this world-class <br>teaching hospital is easily accessible to  <br>patients and the local hospital. By providing <br>a service to the community, our students  <br>graduate with a unique practical and technical <br>skill set, making them highly sought after.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
