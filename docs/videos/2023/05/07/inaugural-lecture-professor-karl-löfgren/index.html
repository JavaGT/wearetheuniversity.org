In his inaugural lecture he shares some of his academic experiences from various jurisdictions based on three different themes: Innovations, Policy, and People. The innovation theme does not only cover his interest in digital platforms in politics and public administration, as well as democratic innovations in local decision-making. His interest in policy covers empirical studies of agenda-setting and implementation on national level and the role of evidence in policymaking. Finally, the theme around people revolves around his more recent research on the rise of a new public bureaucracy in public sector organisations. <br><br>In the end, the three themes are pulled together with some more general observations of the current state of the research field and its relationship to practice.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts

government law and<br>business here at tejingawaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington I'm delighted<br>to be here on behalf of the vice<br>Chancellor in his absence and to welcome<br>you to our University and to the special<br>moment greetings to all family and<br>friends<br>academic and professional colleagues<br>it's now wider Community distinguished<br>guests or<br>we are gathered to celebrate our<br>colleague Professor Carl Lofgren on the<br>occasion of his inaugural lecture<br>cow an internationally recognized<br>scholar is head of school and professor<br>of public administration in our school<br>of government<br>his lecture this evening is entitled<br>public administration Innovations policy<br>people<br>before he joined us in 2013 as an<br>associate professor Carl had already<br>begun a distinguished academic career<br>holding positions with Copenhagen<br>University in Denmark Malmo University<br>in Sweden and Ross Gilda University in<br>Denmark<br>he's an adjunct fellow at the Swedish<br>School of social sciences at Helsinki<br>University in Finland<br>served on the research Committee of the<br>Australia and New Zealand School of<br>government since 2014.<br>and has been invited as keynote speaker<br>to conferences all over the world<br>I myself joined this University in May<br>of 2015 and a year later Carl was<br>appointed to Deputy hip School in the<br>school of government<br>indeed during the years from 2016 as<br>Deputy hit of school until 2022 Carl's<br>advice knowledge and professionalism<br>have been essential to navigating what<br>many of us experienced as<br>extraordinarily challenging times<br>throughout that time I knew our previous<br>hymn School of government Gerald Curry<br>ageley found Carl's Council invaluable<br>advising on everything from the everyday<br>including workloads recruitment<br>engagement to the unprecedented<br>including the Strategic direction of our<br>school of government its curriculum and<br>degree reviews and of course the<br>emergency measures during the covid-19<br>pandemic<br>it is no surprise then that last year<br>the dean my colleague Professor Jane<br>Bryson appointed Carl to the position of<br>head of school a position he has risen<br>to just as convincingly<br>the same advice knowledge and<br>professionalism at cars is not just<br>sought internally however throughout his<br>career his scholarship and expertise<br>have been key in the public sector both<br>here in aotearoa New Zealand and<br>overseas working with trade unions local<br>and Central governments Community groups<br>and both not-for-profit and for-profit<br>organizations<br>he assisted the Malmo commission with<br>policy implementation for their socially<br>sustainable city project to enhance<br>Public Health sustainability and social<br>cohesion in the city he conducted<br>research for the building research<br>Association of New Zealand on how to<br>better use academic outputs in<br>developing housing policy and more<br>recently Carl supported the department<br>of internal affairs in developing their<br>digital government strategy the list is<br>an ever increasing one<br>but beyond his role as a leader Carl has<br>never once forgotten his role as a<br>teacher<br>he is nearing three decades of teaching<br>experience across five institutions<br>three countries and three languages<br>Carl has taught everything from 100<br>level courses to the postgraduate level<br>and consistently being at the Forefront<br>of teaching techniques adapting to the<br>changing needs of our students as<br>Blended and online courses have been<br>introduced<br>Carl develops most of the curriculum for<br>the majority of his courses and has<br>openly shared his expertise with much of<br>his work considered compulsory reading<br>and political science and public<br>administration courses across the world<br>he has supervised 10 PhD students with<br>three of them successfully pursuing<br>academic careers with positions in New<br>Zealand Taiwan and Indonesia and Beyond<br>this has chaired the school's research<br>committee on several occasions since<br>2014 contributing directly to the<br>broader community of doctoral students<br>within our school of government here at<br>tejingawaka and I know there are a<br>number of his doctoral students in this<br>audience this evening<br>the focus of tonight's lecture though is<br>on Carl's research throughout his career<br>he has covered broadly the areas of<br>politics and administration but a<br>special interest is in public sector<br>reforms technology and government and<br>the relationship between politics and<br>administration<br>unpacking politics in the digital age<br>much of this work has been based on<br>International collaboration including<br>his work analyzing how digital<br>Technologies are evolving within<br>government and affecting our cities<br>closer to home Carl has examined what he<br>describes as the true nature of New<br>Zealand's Public Service particularly in<br>relation to the government's recent<br>handling of the covid-19 outbreak<br>tonight Carl will share some of his<br>academic experiences based on three<br>themes Innovation policy and people<br>he will cover his interest in new and<br>emerging digital platforms and politics<br>and public administration both at a<br>national and local government level<br>he will explain the role of evidence and<br>policy making and agenda setting and<br>finally Carl will discuss his latest<br>research into the rise of a new public<br>bureaucracy<br>Carl our University tehringa Waka<br>Victoria University of Wellington is so<br>gladdened and heartened to have you as a<br>member of this professoriate as I noted<br>at the beginning of my remarks it is a<br>moment of Celebration first of all and a<br>distinct pleasure for me to introduce<br>our colleague<br>though thank you very much Mark I'm I<br>astonished uh I didn't recognize myself<br>but it was fantastic uh so welcome<br>everyone thank you for coming out<br>tonight<br>um I will do my best tonight to present<br>some of my main research findings over<br>25 years and it's got to be a bit of a<br>variety show so I hope you can follow me<br>um<br>my area has been I could say Machinery<br>of government<br>has been the study of interaction<br>between politics knowledge civil<br>servants institutions and citizens<br>I have been trying to cover different<br>aspects of public administration but we<br>have been overlaps and some common<br>analytics and I will sort of finish off<br>my lecture today with some of the common<br>Analytics<br>um as Mark said I have tried to<br>emphasize empirical studies there will<br>be some Theory but not too much today uh<br>and I I do truly enjoy conducting<br>empirical studies<br>and I have done it at different levels<br>of government so I've been studying<br>local governments I have also been<br>studying subunits of local council at<br>the same time I have also tried to<br>come to integrate studies of national<br>government and even transnational<br>government on the European level<br>oh and by the way the picture here is<br>what came up when I tried to Google uh<br>civil service on New Zealand archives<br>I'm not sure why this picture came up<br>but I thought it was lovely so it's a<br>census and statistics Department's<br>annual staff picnic in pekaka region<br>from 1938.<br>up<br>I have done studies in lots of different<br>areas and I won't be able to cover all<br>these areas so I've been focusing on<br>free Fields with two cases from each<br>field so it's three by two<br>in terms of innovation I will look at<br>digital Innovations which was where I<br>actually started my career I will also<br>include something about participatory<br>Innovations on a local scale<br>in terms of policy I will say something<br>about modern policy making with a Point<br>of Departure in Visionary governance and<br>something about evidence-based policy<br>making<br>and finally in terms of the people I<br>will talk about a new public bureaucracy<br>about the role of projects and project<br>duplication and I also say something<br>about the role of the new type of<br>organizational professionals we are<br>witnessing in public sector<br>organizations<br>okay so let's start with Innovations<br>and you probably recognize the photo of<br>that building on Stout Street MB I<br>thought it was I couldn't find any good<br>picture of innovation so I picked this<br>one<br>um so my first project was actually my<br>PhD product<br>this is an area where I'm still working<br>in I'm very often asked to be a reviewer<br>on various<br>manuscripts application for research<br>graphs or research incomes and it's it's<br>something I haven't been able to let go<br>really although I must say I don't do<br>very much the research myself in that<br>area<br>so when I became a PhD students I<br>actually set out the rather simple<br>straightforward question it's the new<br>internet technology enhancing with<br>quality of democracy<br>so with us back in the 90s was the 96 97<br>internet was quite new it was a novel<br>thing some people afford it was just a<br>fade a fashion it would disappear uh but<br>it was an area a research area full of<br>promising or speculations and we have a<br>number of pundits particular journalist<br>actually who saw there was some promise<br>in this area<br>with new technologies people will be<br>able to connect in new ways we will be<br>people will be able the public will be<br>able to bypass traditional editorial<br>Gatekeepers we can re-establish<br>connections between politicians and the<br>public so there were all these promises<br>in the field<br>there were also some more negative or<br>dystopian perspectives but overall it<br>wasn't it full of promises<br>and I was involved in my own PhD product<br>in studying the Nordic political parties<br>use of<br>new technologies a particularly studying<br>debate books and the debates and<br>discussions on party debate boards I was<br>also involved in one project on the<br>Danish parliament's use of the new<br>debate boards and new types of<br>experience with the internet and in<br>local government elections in 1997. so<br>there were lots of experiments going on<br>here<br>and what we what I basically did was I<br>conducted some kind of evaluation or<br>assessment of equality of democracy<br>based a normative set of criteria so my<br>simple question was is it will actually<br>enhancing recorded democracy<br>and I mainly use qualitative methods<br>some of them I had to invent myself<br>because it wasn't such a novel field so<br>there was no established research<br>methodologies in my state<br>in terms of my findings well my first<br>three challenge was actually how do we<br>Define democracy<br>for many of its promises were actually<br>talking about democracy as access to<br>information or access to debate and<br>dialogue but democracy is more than that<br>it's also about accountability it's<br>about adaptiveness to the political<br>system it's about the creation of<br>democratic identities so while my first<br>task here was actually to develop some<br>kind of criteria or how do we evaluate<br>democracy<br>the second finding was there's a<br>trade-off between this<br>and we invite lots of people to the<br>debate board on the internet but of<br>course we'll make it with the bait<br>but will probably ruin the quality of a<br>debate<br>uh if you want quality well we should<br>invite those people who can talk<br>we don't want those people who are not<br>able to formulate their political views<br>so I try trade-offs here<br>what I could say was that these<br>Innovative channels for debate<br>engagement and participation did not<br>automatically lead to Innovative<br>outcomes it was sort of a mix back I<br>wouldn't say it was bad for democracy<br>but I wouldn't say it actually enhanced<br>that much<br>perhaps a bit<br>depressing outcome or result but I felt<br>that well at least that's what you do as<br>a researcher you follow your evidence<br>and regardless of outcome you you sort<br>of make a conclusion about well maybe<br>this is yes<br>mediocre outcome<br>what I also saw was that Rhys new<br>channels gave opportunities for those<br>already active in politics but there are<br>a few signs of enhanced participation<br>and inclusion of excluded groups<br>and one thing I discovered which I think<br>we all are aware and familiar with today<br>is that online anonymity creates<br>perverted effects of behavior<br>and I do remember I mentioned this to a<br>journalist who interviewed me and he<br>said well you don't understand the<br>prospect you don't see the promises here<br>in 1998.<br>people are actually quite civilized on<br>um another thing was which I will return<br>to later on as one of the commonalities<br>here and overlapses I would a long stick<br>of experiments<br>so it was an interesting experiment<br>happening somewhere in the world<br>everyone tried to copy it<br>and then this explains what dismantled<br>and we never heard about it again<br>although it continued to leave like a<br>zombie in the academic literature it's a<br>success story<br>and<br>equally I have to admit today but<br>politics<br>came digital by default we can't think<br>about politics without today without<br>thinking about a digital platforms and<br>digital devices<br>so that was my first case of the themes<br>the second one which actually was based<br>on the first one was local participatory<br>design and evaluation<br>which was a theoretical and an Empirical<br>research field for me<br>I have at this time uh relocated to my<br>first University of Roscoe<br>I mean you were really interested in<br>studying how can we create Democratic<br>realms for<br>local government sub-units neighborhood<br>Council advisory boards Etc in<br>particular sense we had just introduced<br>a big murderer amalgam amalgamation of<br>local governments a local Council today<br>so they want to see how can we somehow<br>preserve old channels for Democratic<br>discussions and inclusion of citizens<br>given that we have actually made the<br>councils much bigger<br>here once again which I started with<br>some kind of theoretical development<br>with a colleague where we try to put<br>together a I would call a framework for<br>assessing the Democratic quality of<br>local participatory and collaborative<br>experience in in urban planning<br>in addition to that we managed to to<br>raise some money to study empirically<br>new local Democratic foreign decision<br>making including both citizens partition<br>civil servants and professional and free<br>councils<br>uh and parallel to that I was also<br>research leader for big Nordic Network<br>comprising participants from Norway<br>Sweden Denmark Finland and even Iceland<br>a baseball's mainly conducted with<br>qualitative studies and my colleagues<br>minority colleagues conducted some<br>surveys<br>the first interesting finding here was<br>the discrepancy in expectations between<br>politicians and citizens<br>so politicians wanted to communicate<br>with long-term visions<br>we had lots of issues by way while<br>citizens were seeking<br>celebrity problems<br>polls was one thing which set up in our<br>during our interviews there was a<br>difficult to mobilize Public public<br>interest in certain communities<br>reads were more successful in making it<br>work<br>so when you had a strong Village you<br>could easily immobilize people and you<br>could easily Lobby the local government<br>and use these new forms for participate<br>participatory channels to actually raise<br>funding or for example a new gymnasium<br>for a school<br>and in one case we actually had a<br>community which actually themselves<br>developed their own zoning plan for<br>their their community<br>which was adopted by the council very<br>thought it was great because we didn't<br>have to pay for it<br>um so these strong affluent areas were<br>much better in actually using these new<br>channels<br>um meanwhile modernized groups remain<br>excluded and particularly in urban areas<br>of these local Council we couldn't see<br>any change and actually it was very very<br>difficult to mobilize anyone<br>these new forms of participatory<br>democracy happen in the shadow of<br>hierarchy one who called Misa governance<br>so the traditional local government<br>bureaucracy was still intact<br>I'm very happy to jump in every time it<br>was a problem<br>and once these new channels were<br>disestablished<br>a bureaucracy yes moved in again<br>there was a strong emphasis on access<br>and dialogue how can we make people more<br>active how can we invite people how can<br>we get them to talk<br>but these models or platforms often<br>lacked accountability and legitimacy<br>they were not legitimate in the eyes of<br>minority of citizens<br>another interesting aspect here was that<br>the professionals were sidelined or even<br>thrown under a bus<br>the politicians threw out the teachers<br>uh the healthcare professional Etc to<br>meet the citizens<br>and asking them to solve the problems<br>and the way it was a method for a<br>politicians<br>to flip by throwing the professional<br>front of it<br>and the final finding here was we asked<br>ourselves worries actually projects for<br>enhancing the quality of democracy or<br>whatever projects from the communication<br>unit of the local councils<br>so second case now I turned the policy<br>by the way this is painting by my<br>this is not completely chronological so<br>I'm going back a couple of years here<br>so in terms of policy<br>I managed to be part of Landing uh made<br>a grant from the Swedish research<br>Council in 2002.<br>and it was an attempt to study the new<br>Swedish information and communication<br>technology policy<br>and what we tried to do was basically<br>following traditional policy cycle<br>so we looked at Agenda setting design<br>decision implementation and evaluation<br>of a completely new policy field or at<br>least it was a positive field which the<br>politicians had named a new policy<br>it was also a rather novel form of<br>organizing policy making<br>rather than tradition setting up a<br>traditional agency or using traditional<br>policy instruments with Investments<br>legislation it was more about<br>communication it was more about<br>knowledge it was all these sort of soft<br>ideas about visions<br>and Visionary governments<br>uh it was actually quite a big project<br>we interviewed no less than 80 people<br>yes we've spent lots of time on Swedish<br>trades and we also include some<br>documentary analysis<br>in terms of what we covered<br>in cases we try to capture I.T and<br>education e-government but also with<br>um our findings were yeah<br>the first thing we were a bit surprised<br>about was that this was not sort of what<br>we expected from a bureaucracy I mean I<br>think we me and my colleague we had some<br>ideas about well we got to study people<br>um having meetings we got to study uh<br>various forms of policy briefs<br>um commission reports Etc and instead we<br>ended with feel of politics happening in<br>gazebo tents<br>with wine and nibbles and a DJ in the<br>corner people mingling and that was sort<br>of a politics of ICT policy it was about<br>bringing people together making contacts<br>creating networks so it was sort of yeah<br>it wasn't really what we expected<br>what we did identify very quickly was<br>the role of policy entrepreneurs in<br>setting their gender<br>many of these people who were included<br>in the policy making process were I.T<br>professionals or I.T entrepreneurs<br>and they were actually doing what we<br>could to see their opportunities<br>and it took it took me seven years it<br>wasn't until several years afterwards<br>when I started to pick up on marketing<br>research but realized these people were<br>not actually promoting a policy or like<br>they were branding themselves<br>and of course I'm probably nothing new<br>or really<br>astonishing but at the same time we were<br>not expecting that when we talked about<br>policy which was I could pay with<br>taxpayers money the government actually<br>invested lots of money here<br>um we tried to set up governing Networks<br>it was quite a sort of modern way of<br>organizing politics uh we used terms<br>like knowledge<br>connected networks all these fatter<br>terms uh and of course missions<br>these networks with people we had<br>invited both from industry Consultants<br>academies that are class completely with<br>the existing bureaucracy or rather a<br>um<br>we interviewed one person from Ministry<br>of trade and he just took it out to the<br>library and said here is where we put<br>all the reports all the documents<br>everything we sent to us we never read<br>it<br>the lack of long-term thinking also<br>meant that new these new pulse issues<br>fluctuated very quickly<br>and we're going to say so much quite<br>shaky this organization with networks<br>was actually established after two years<br>and as I said it was difficult to<br>convert conversions to implementable<br>policies<br>what was interesting though was it was<br>something I returned to many years later<br>as well was the pivotal role of<br>Benchmark in a nation branding because<br>every time we talked to someone we<br>started by saying well Sweden is ranked<br>as number one or swing is ranked as<br>number two in the world we are the best<br>and I couldn't understand it until I<br>heard someone from Estonia being asked<br>the same question about Estonia being<br>benched more or answers number one in<br>the world well that's it for branding<br>look at us we are modern<br>we're using the technology<br>we are high in the ranking of<br>transparency common invest in US<br>it had nothing to do with technology it<br>wasn't not about better education or<br>better services to the public resources<br>about Nation primary<br>uh so we sort of ended up<br>how I would say too depressing result<br>but it was the flavor of a month and the<br>projectification of politics it was<br>um my second case<br>when I talk about policy it's positive<br>evidence<br>and this is perhaps more aligned with<br>form of research so I know some of you<br>here have been involved in<br>how do policy professionals utilize<br>academic outputs<br>what enables and constrains the use of<br>academic sources available conducted<br>here in New Zealand 2015 2016 and the<br>second<br>um and it's based on this simple notion<br>but evidence-based or evidence-informed<br>policy making requires interfaces<br>between knowledge evidence and policy<br>I think most of you here have come<br>across this<br>and it was a general server combined<br>with a major focus group study with 15<br>groups within one specific policy domain<br>that is housing policy New Zealand so we<br>ask questions about accessibility<br>cultures or differences in cultures<br>between policy and Academia news for<br>Less communication and channels between<br>Academia and the policy world<br>our findings were about the theoretical<br>notion of two separate communities<br>policy in Academia is biological was<br>biological confirmed<br>we had sort of a traditional issues<br>around incompatible time frames<br>between Academia and policy but lack of<br>access from the policy side and the<br>different cultures<br>many of the positive people we<br>interviewed actually complained about<br>the language academics are using<br>um however where different sectors have<br>a different modes of interaction<br>I think housing policy was quite extreme<br>in one end compared to for example<br>health or other areas where we are<br>established channels between Academia<br>policy<br>so there were less attention to<br>traditional Sciences some policy domains<br>are more attention to our aspects such<br>as narratives<br>uh there are a lot of different<br>understandings of a notion of knowledge<br>on what we mean by purposeful knowledge<br>uh also some are very good ambiguity<br>whether demand is for expertise or for<br>experts<br>because in some cases in particularly<br>the housing policy areas it was about we<br>want someone to rubber stamp what we are<br>saying we don't need the expertise but<br>we want the expert<br>uh one thing which was quite<br>embarrassing was that many of those<br>people we dealed for housing policy<br>that were expressing at the University<br>such as an institution whilst being<br>instead of actually getting access to<br>academics I could talk to academics<br>they were met with people from<br>uh external engagement waving with an<br>invoice<br>uh which I must say was quite<br>embarrassing<br>um<br>the first<br>case off paper boss study around<br>projector projectification of a public<br>sector<br>um an overall question were are we<br>increasingly organizing public sectors<br>activities as product and what are the<br>consequences<br>so what we were witnessing was that<br>particularly in public service delivery<br>on on a local scale in a welfare state<br>we could see that<br>forms of Engagement were organized<br>we could also see that National and<br>European investment bodies required<br>adaptation to project management<br>principles but there's also a general<br>Trend towards conceiving both positive<br>design and implementation as distinct<br>projects<br>when we talk about projects we're not<br>talking about large-scale infrastructure<br>products<br>was worried someone's going to ask<br>questions about that it's about smaller<br>projects in Service delivery<br>and<br>in terms of outputs I was involved in<br>editing a special issue with some more<br>the contribution and I also co-authored<br>a book chapter on the government major<br>project reporting in New Zealand<br>which went into a book called<br>projectification<br>of this was based on mix of data<br>collection methods service qualitative<br>status based on interviews and<br>documentary sources<br>so when we talk about projects<br>they are being with all concept approach<br>being in in interpreted and applied in a<br>very inconsistent way throughout the<br>public sector<br>so even though there are some templates<br>such as a prince2 model<br>many just make up or invent their own<br>what we detected about confirmed because<br>of this was a really new knowledge is<br>that project managers have created their<br>own community of practice with<br>Professional Standards<br>so from from being something Engineers<br>we're doing we now have a profession<br>called project managers<br>and this is something I followed in a<br>subsequent research project about this<br>new type of professional groups in the<br>um another uh finding in our project was<br>but this is the way for politicians<br>to demonstrate determinism and viability<br>without actually making any real<br>investment<br>organizing public sector activities of a<br>project it's actually quite cheap<br>because it's just a project<br>and you know you will one day pull the<br>plug<br>because you run out of time and you run<br>out of money<br>so it's a convenient way or politicians<br>projects always come to an end<br>but what we witnessed was that part of<br>organizations became ingrained in<br>constantly looking for new product<br>funding<br>or a group of people who are constantly<br>yes looking for new investment<br>possibilities opportunities either from<br>National governments or from European<br>government<br>foreign<br>when we try to ask about outcome about<br>results<br>we never got we never got down to any<br>good examples of it which is doing good<br>but it was a good way of organizing<br>public sector activities from a<br>political perspective<br>and in a paradoxical way<br>products became a political technocratic<br>way to de-politicize positive side and<br>implementation<br>because we are we got a template to<br>follow<br>we are listening to advice<br>so it's a good way of actually a little<br>politician's perspective to<br>de-politicize<br>both the same and implementation<br>so a final product here the new public<br>bureaucracy<br>so this is a product which is still<br>ongoing I know it says 2022 here it's a<br>comparative project between Sweden New<br>Zealand uh it's funded through the<br>um what we're doing is we're looking at<br>the concept of<br>Spirit criticization from a Workforce<br>perspective rather than from a budget<br>perspective which have been sort of a<br>norm for a long time over the past 40 50<br>years<br>uh in the U.S we talk about admissive<br>intensity or red tape research well<br>we've been looking at budgets and see<br>how much money is actually allocated to<br>and make sure I get the right glass of<br>this is also an area I think for those<br>of you who are working with service you<br>probably have heard bickering about this<br>many times about the growing and<br>Communications unit or growing<br>Communications Department of those<br>people working because quality assurance<br>getting more stuff<br>um what we discovered was there's not<br>much empirical work here<br>we did find unsurprising you know it was<br>quite a lot of research in this area of<br>people studying higher educational<br>tertiary education<br>um where we discovered well there were<br>had been an increase of<br>um administrative support functions<br>um at University or tertiary educational<br>institutions<br>so what we did first of all was looking<br>at the changes in the composition of a<br>public sector Workforce what does it<br>um and it must<br>probably much easier to do with Sweden<br>because they had pretty good<br>stats on different uh occupational<br>groups<br>um whereas in New Zealand we have pretty<br>good starts from a Public Service<br>Commission<br>but if you look into the individual<br>organization<br>um we were actually met with the answer<br>that we only use have some old payroll<br>systems so retrieving data for<br>um<br>from a public sector Workforce data<br>what's difficult or if you go down to a<br>more detail level<br>the overall question we asked was are<br>organizational professionals On The Rise<br>and what causes it<br>in terms of what causes it we discovered<br>or at least we are still hypervising<br>um but it's the role of managerialism<br>but also politicization and<br>professionalization<br>but in particular when we have conducted<br>the interview with research come through<br>but it is not just the evil ghost of new<br>public management and managerialists<br>it's also about politicization and<br>professionalization<br>one common denominator vote is<br>accountability<br>an accountability here is not it's not<br>just a traditional political or legal<br>accountability<br>it's also the professional<br>accountability<br>connection to what I said about product<br>managers your accountable to profession<br>a more important social accountability<br>the reputation of organization<br>and all these factors meaning that we<br>need to build up accountability<br>means that we have had a growth of<br>certain professional groups as certain<br>new professional groups<br>so what we looked at was General trench<br>fdas in a public sector Workforce as<br>well as some couple of special cases of<br>land transport agencies by police force<br>and tertiary education<br>and this was constituted one big chance<br>for us because it's very very difficult<br>to compare different jurisdictions<br>a particular Sweden and New Zealand<br>because the structures are so different<br>responsibilities are so different<br>in New Zealand is much a unitary state<br>centralized state<br>in Sweden about three different levels<br>and most of the welfare Service delivery<br>is decentralized or devolved to local<br>tests<br>so some some of the normal functions we<br>associate with public services or public<br>sector<br>not compare so we had to pick someone<br>where we could compare land transport<br>ages that are more or less the same in<br>both countries police<br>more or less the same social education<br>yeah there are some differences but more<br>or less we could compare them<br>and we use both quantitative and<br>um I'll find this was a stronger<br>increase among organizational<br>professionals than among occupational<br>and professional and technical analysis<br>of stuff<br>so we have<br>most traditional Technical and negative<br>people what we used to call clerks and<br>technicians Etc may have been may have<br>been in Decline for a couple of years<br>now<br>is about professionalization<br>when we talk about traditional<br>occupational professionals<br>there have not been the increase but<br>hasn't been a decrease it's sort of<br>stabilized but there is an increase in<br>organizational professional but those<br>groups who are sort of supporting<br>management and who are working<br>internally mainly not not just back<br>office but mainly working support<br>management the report of organization<br>well I would say it's a huge variation<br>this product originated in Sweden and<br>that's also where we found the most<br>significant significant increases in<br>organization profession we didn't see<br>that much of that here and you see it<br>even though yes there has been an<br>increase here as well<br>uh so there are some common trends<br>different forces managerialists<br>politicization of professionalization<br>seem to affect organizations differently<br>but still accountability and control it<br>always forms seems to be a common<br>denominator<br>and we are still contemplating the<br>normative question is this a positive or<br>A negative development<br>because I mean particularly when you<br>read about tertiary education and what's<br>happening in terms of changing workflow<br>it's very very negative<br>we're not really sure if it's just<br>negative<br>but we leave that to read as well you<br>make some at some point find out and<br>give you an answer so finishing off here<br>some general observations<br>I would describe as paradoxes<br>and this is a based on all these<br>different products plus another few but<br>we are not moving away from<br>managerialism<br>if we look at the literature in public<br>administration there is some sort of<br>this taxonomic idea what we have gone<br>from all public administration to new<br>public management and soon we will be in<br>Malala land of new public governance or<br>something<br>uh<br>I personally see it as managerialism has<br>moved away from the 1980s<br>it's still manageable<br>it doesn't look the same as a deal with<br>1980s<br>another observation General observation<br>is the short-term members of experiments<br>Innovations and projects generates an<br>Administration where visibility and<br>narration seek to substitute genuine<br>performance and value<br>it's all about performativity<br>it's not about values and performance<br>I mean this is also Paradox the<br>political attempts to deep politicize<br>for administration through the<br>introduction of technocratic practices<br>so through political intervention we try<br>to deeply decide public administration<br>but narrative is taking essential role<br>in whatever the public sector is doing<br>and this is also something I mean I've<br>said individually several time here in<br>New Zealand<br>and I'm not saying that's a bad thing<br>it's just a just an observation<br>um established understandings of<br>knowledge<br>knowledge minutes and citizens<br>engagement are being redefined<br>and we've probably all heard about fake<br>news Etc<br>but it was interesting when I<br>interviewed people in the housing policy<br>project about how we perceive knowledge<br>but it doesn't mean the same as for us<br>academics<br>it's about what you thought<br>a knowledge is not necessarily something<br>which is scientific<br>the same goes for Governors and citizen<br>engagement<br>it's not the traditional way of thinking<br>about citizen engagement it's not the<br>same way of thinking about governments<br>we also see expansion of professionals<br>and new professionals groups entering<br>with public sector Workforce<br>and one of the interesting uh thing<br>we've concluded in one of the Swedish<br>project was that we often talk about<br>supply and demand when we talk about<br>social education and future employers<br>and careers<br>and we think that it's because of a<br>demand we create new educational<br>programs but we discovered Wars that new<br>types of graduates<br>create new types of workplaces it's an<br>opposite<br>and it may sound illogical but it is<br>actually when you think about it it's<br>not completely logical<br>managerialism application creating an<br>increased demand for a broader scope of<br>a capability mechanism meanwhile we keep<br>hearing that accountability seem to be<br>which I haven't mentioned here so it's a<br>mixed bag of bigger and smaller projects<br>I think I've managed to keep the time<br>Couture<br>um well I'm Jane Bryson the dean of the<br>Willing School of Business and<br>government and it's my honor and<br>pleasure to give the votive thanks to<br>Professor Lofgren and his inaugural<br>professorial lecture tonight<br>um so tonight Professor Lofgren has<br>shared with us his interest and Research<br>into the heart of democracy and action<br>and the Machinery of government through<br>his examination of Innovations policy<br>and people in public administration<br>shown us the pretensions and the<br>tensions in digital Democratic<br>Innovations<br>he's explored the influences on policy<br>making from how policy agendas are set<br>to how they are governed and how policy<br>is made what counts as evidence or not<br>or is it both including that dance of<br>branding and influences and it made me<br>wonder are we back somewhat<br>controversially to a modern version of<br>CP Snow's two cultures or maybe it's<br>three<br>Carl also examines the emergence of a<br>new public bureaucracy highlighting<br>projectification and I I'm just boggled<br>at the way we extend words you know<br>commodification monetization<br>projectification<br>and the increase of organizational<br>professionals versus occupational<br>professionals<br>I'm interested to see more of Carl's<br>work here because as he observed the<br>public service has always had its<br>organizational professionals hasn't it<br>but<br>by another name when I got my first job<br>as a graduate in the state Services<br>Commission<br>I was an assistant advisory officer and<br>I reveled in the job family of 007<br>101 and I won't even mention the pay<br>rate because it sounds totally pathetic<br>now although I was like a pig and clover<br>at the time<br>that's what bureaucracies do isn't it<br>so I'm interested to see more of your<br>work in the area Carl<br>and in concluding<br>um Carl made a number of Reflections on<br>the paradoxes that he's seen through his<br>research and the performativity and<br>narratives around public administration<br>he had another conclusion in an earlier<br>set of sports which I was set which he<br>removed from these slides which I was<br>going to comment on<br>well he a final observation about<br>rather than being cynical one should<br>take an ironic approach to viewing these<br>issues<br>and um I thought that that was a really<br>um and I also thought it was quite an<br>intriguing injunction<br>which drove me to the dictionary and<br>other sources which why I'm compelled to<br>actually share it with you even though<br>it wasn't on the slides anymore I<br>avoided check GPT to explore irony and<br>cynicism and I learned that irony and<br>cynicism are both defense mechanisms who<br>knew<br>um<br>and an irony as we all know the surface<br>meaning and the underlying meaning of<br>what is said and not the same and<br>cynicism is minimizing the impact of the<br>object<br>so we can refer obliquely to our true<br>view on matters through the ironic<br>statement or we can cynically reduce<br>matters to nothing new Under the Sun<br>which might make us realists or not<br>so this is clearly a debate that<br>requires refreshments<br>um there's lots to take the opportunity<br>to congratulate and ask Professor Carl<br>Lofton lots of questions<br>so I'm the only thing standing between<br>you and those important opportunities<br>and I invite you to Refreshments on the<br>mezzanine floor<br>and I say to calm<br>thank you and congratulations on<br>becoming a professor and let's show
