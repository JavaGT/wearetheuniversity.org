accurate.</p><p>Kia Ora<br>then<br>Ika<br>foreign<br>um<br>I'm going to divide my talk into three<br>areas<br>you heard a little bit about my fakapapa<br>already but I'll go a bit deeper<br>not only about my family but my<br>intellectual and University whakapapa<br>um and then I'll move to talk about my<br>scholarly contributions just to give you<br>a little bit of flavor on the type of<br>work I do<br>and then I'll conclude by posing some<br>directions that I'm interested in<br>currently pursuing<br>and underpinning all these three areas<br>is this idea of a privileged underdog<br>this is how I feel this how<br>people make me feel uh being in between<br>couches and and having to succeed in a<br>different reality uh and a different<br>cultural backgrounds<br>um and this makes my work<br>um much more engaged in in activism in<br>the sense of trying to lift barriers for<br>others to succeed in their on their<br>penis in their dreams as well<br>so start with my fakapapa so it's<br>amazing opportunity and I'm also<br>privileged to be able to present a<br>little bit about my journey I know that<br>um there are many<br>amazing professionals that never have<br>this opportunity to share in the public<br>is fear<br>um his or her journey so I'm really<br>privileged to be able to do so so I'll<br>be talking a little bit about my<br>identity and my identity formation so<br>just to bring a little bit of psychology<br>into it<br>um you can say that I will be talking a<br>little a little bit about a narrative<br>psychology<br>um but narrative psychology is never<br>about<br>you know a Wikipedia so a person's life<br>story is not a Wikipedia biography of<br>the facts and events of our life but<br>rather the way a person integrates those<br>facts and events internally to create<br>his or her identity<br>um and it will become clear that even<br>the title of my presentation brings my<br>identity to the fore and this is what I<br>want to share with you briefly<br>so I'm from Brazil as some of you<br>already know<br>um and I'm from Olinda Olinda is one of<br>the oldest cities of Brazil<br>and the name means oh beautiful or Linda<br>and it's from the state of panamboku<br>it's a really culturally diverse State<br>and there are many including a famous<br>singer from my my state lenini who said<br>we are so culturally diverse that even<br>in the name penhambuku there is no<br>single letter that repeats itself so<br>it's really diverse<br>um and the name comes from indigenous<br>language to piguarani it means<br>or a hole in the sea because there are<br>many rivers and I mentioned two rivers<br>in my pepeha baby and kapi baribi<br>so this is my fakapapa my family my<br>um and they came from both families from<br>panabuku but one from Gloria dugota<br>um most European<br>immigrants that came to Brazil<br>um again about privilege in Brazil<br>unfortunately we didn't keep a lot of<br>good records of our heritage<br>for you know power religious and<br>um heritance reasons they they burn the<br>papers from the ships arriving to Brazil<br>so unfortunately we can't really connect<br>our whakapapa but we know that lemus is<br>a quite famous pronounced<br>um surname from Portugal my father's<br>family is much more indigenous and<br>Indigenous looking but again we don't<br>have the records but we believe and this<br>is why I use my pepeja kayate as the<br>largest indigenous groups from Panama at<br>that time<br>um<br>my grandparents had 14 kids my father<br>was the oldest<br>um my granddad was killed when my father<br>was 18 and he had to look after all his<br>siblings and that happened because<br>family dispute and the countryside of<br>the state in Panama<br>in this city as shoe<br>and my original family name was sariva<br>but we had to get rid of it because it<br>was too dangerous to carry that surname<br>because people could kill us<br>okay<br>so after my granddad was killed the<br>family moved to Gloria the goita it's<br>where my my parents met they are there<br>in the wedding day<br>my mom is shaking her head<br>um<br>and and I so we had um<br>a typical<br>um lower class<br>um you know epic bringing<br>my sister is now doing a masters in<br>language but they never progress after a<br>degree to do a master's before I was the<br>first in my family but they always like<br>to study so my father I study education<br>and then law my mom studied<br>um education and then international<br>relations<br>my brother uh<br>studied first speech therapy and in law<br>and my sister did accounting then<br>education and now as I said is doing a<br>master's in education<br>um this is some picture of myself<br>growing up<br>um because we we talked about it<br>recently I was really religious growing<br>up Catholic and you can see a picture up<br>there<br>um<br>but I like to have fun you can see a<br>picture of me with um a cast in my arm I<br>broke my arm a few times that one was<br>getting mango from a mango tree<br>and my family as you can imagine<br>um in my side and my father's side 14<br>uncle's and aunties on the other side<br>six<br>I have a really extended family and I<br>forgot to mention and highlight that my<br>father and my mother were the oldest in<br>the families a lot of responsibilities<br>they had to you know to to look after<br>them<br>but quite Adventures<br>um<br>happy bringing which brings me to the<br>idea of Malo keru that you saw in the<br>title Malo quiero nice olindes and it<br>was interesting because Brazilians are<br>asking me you know what does it mean<br>because in my hometown it means this but<br>it's quite unique to happy bringings in<br>our lives in Orlando so I asked some<br>friends<br>from that reality to share what it means<br>to you<br>so a guy who was born or raised in the<br>slopes of Olinda a wise person whose<br>knowledge originates from everyday<br>experienced marked by uncertainty<br>boredom and two by favor music and out<br>of season kind of our love a thief of<br>Hearts an Everyday Athlete young people<br>on the margins of society who group<br>together to create visibility for their<br>existence or too hard to explain only<br>being one to know a good friend Luna who<br>is the uh it's amazing to have an old<br>childhood friend we know each other for<br>over 30 years and he now migrated to to<br>New Zealand six years about six years<br>ago<br>so it's hard to explain<br>um perhaps pictures would tell a little<br>bit<br>um but it's someone who you know is<br>trying to figure out what he or she<br>wants to do but it's connected to the<br>kind of our culture of Brazil<br>and Olinda<br>um and the frevo and there's a picture<br>of a good friend of mine yogurt and you<br>can see me there in my head Place<br>surrounded by forever music and lots of<br>uh people<br>which brings me to my family my<br>wonderful family and it gives me a lot<br>of joy to know that a lot of my friends<br>from Olinda recognize Erica Milan Elise<br>ice Malachi as well and they call them<br>what about my intellectual whakapapa<br>there are two figures that are quite<br>important to me that made me decide to<br>study psychology at the first place<br>one is the poet Finance from Portugal<br>and in particular the writings he did<br>under this Seldon name Alberto Cairo<br>the Brazilian writer Clarisse lispecto<br>and the rock singer and composer houses<br>and Auda and Ed sang Some of how his<br>songs earlier today<br>so a completely different art forms but<br>they all brought this idea of<br>existential questioning<br>and that was really inspiring to me to<br>figure out to try to understand why we<br>are here and what I want to pursue in my<br>career and I knew that I want to do<br>psychology it was really interesting<br>because I went and did a vocational test<br>and the psychologist at that time said<br>well you should do law or Arts<br>and so no I really want to do<br>psychologists yeah I don't think it will<br>fit you but good luck but I I knew I<br>want to do that we didn't have anyone in<br>my family so I couldn't go and ask about<br>it and talk about it but those<br>existential questions<br>um were really strong and made me decide<br>to study psychology<br>it's interesting that still today<br>shouted friends still call me dalua or<br>from the Moon unusual thinker and<br>non-conformist this is the side of me<br>that's still quite prevalent<br>University whakapapa I did my<br>undergraduates at the University at the<br>Catholic University of panabuku I did<br>the community and clinical work grounded<br>in Gestalt therapy and then I did a<br>internship in Industry industrial and<br>organizational psychology in a big<br>multinational Alcoa<br>interestingly enough I decided to do a<br>master's degree I failed the English<br>exam in uh the University of the capital<br>of Brazil Brasilia<br>um is so you understand the level of<br>English I had when I started my journey<br>here in New Zealand so I decided to go<br>closer to my hometown and I did my<br>masters in another Public University and<br>my first main Mentor was professor<br>govaya and I focus on human values and<br>intimate relationships<br>and then he was telling us you should<br>try and do your PhD in an<br>English-speaking country so you can<br>publish in English yeah the the language<br>of science is English so I started<br>thinking what to do<br>looking at options I was planning to go<br>being a surfer I was thinking to go to<br>California<br>um to study there<br>um but the the colleague I contacted<br>there unfortunately he said they didn't<br>have a PhD program but<br>huge coincidence he said but I received<br>this email from a professor from New<br>Zealand<br>you should consider New Zealand and I<br>said well I didn't know anything about<br>New Zealand<br>but the focus was to save my scholarship<br>money from my masters to converting to<br>dollar and my parents are able to help<br>me and I came to New Zealand in 2001.<br>some pictures from that time<br>um my first ever English book I read was<br>Harry Potter my first ever New Zealand<br>CD was chefful<br>and I had the opportunity through<br>capoeira a Brazilian martial arts I was<br>the only Brazilian that group at that<br>time with her Masters a master who came<br>from California and we stayed in MRI<br>which close to Rotorua and it's amazing<br>that i'm now based here in Bay of Plenty<br>close to that marai so my first<br>experience there but I already had in<br>mind that I want to come back and do my<br>PhD so before coming here I contacted a<br>professor at the University of Auckland<br>and I was a honorary research assistant<br>and I was helping him to enter data and<br>figure out how I could come back with a<br>scholarship so I would go to an English<br>school from nine to two and then work<br>um<br>I I went back in this Gap year 2002 I<br>passed an exam really competitive exam<br>to work in a federal University in<br>Brazil<br>but I quit this life job for Life<br>position when I received a scholarship<br>from the University of Auckland<br>the University offer a scholarship that<br>only pay the fees so I had to work to<br>survive and was quite tough but I did my<br>PhD with another amazing Mentor I had<br>John ducked<br>and the fox was cross-cultural research<br>on environmental attitudes<br>and my Visa only allowed me to walk 15<br>hours per week so the job I had the<br>first one was working at the University<br>Library from six to nine every morning<br>I didn't have a lot of money so I had to<br>drink a lot of the milk made available<br>at the school of psychology<br>and then I started getting tutoring jobs<br>remember my English was not really sharp<br>at that time<br>but I work really hard and I get the<br>first year here I submit my first<br>English publication<br>um and it's amazing that was the first<br>study of my PhD and still really<br>relevant quite excited internationally<br>it's quite technical my English has<br>improved but I made it yeah my dream of<br>coming here and Publishing English was<br>fulfilled and I wanted more<br>so I got positions here it was really<br>interesting when I told my parents when<br>I I got the offer to<br>to stay<br>um and as well that wasn't the deal that<br>it was for you to go study and come back<br>but I decided to stay so first I work as<br>a research fellow an amazing project the<br>youth 2000 project with doctors and<br>nurses and then I got a formal you know<br>lecturing position at Victoria<br>University of Wellington I stayed there<br>for 12 years and then uh for family<br>reasons and professional reasons we<br>moved here into went uh 2020 for the<br>University of waikato here in Tauranga<br>Moana<br>okay<br>so these are a little bit of my fakapapa<br>or about my scholarly contributions<br>first I need to acknowledge that science<br>is as a team sport<br>um I publish with a lot of collaborators<br>so I need to up to thank my mentors<br>formal and informal mentors but also my<br>collaborators and students and also the<br>funding over the years I have secured<br>myself and with my colleagues many<br>findings from Brazil from New Zealand<br>and also internationally<br>some of you have seen this illusion<br>before yeah<br>it's the horizontal vertical illusion it<br>looks like the vertical line is bigger<br>than the horizontal line but in fact<br>they are the same and I think this<br>illustrates my academic pursue so I can<br>say that you know my deep interest is<br>environmental psychology<br>but I would find too boring to just<br>study that psychology is such a<br>beautiful discipline that I'm interested<br>in other things so I have this<br>horizontal approach to my work as well<br>um so is a t sotaciano but also my my<br>you know my focus of my work but I could<br>say that perhaps is an illusion because<br>if you look my Publications I go to many<br>domains so just to provide some examples<br>I'm interested in how to measure<br>psychological phenomenon and it has<br>varied from looking at depression life<br>satisfaction<br>and how to measure psychological<br>phenomenon across cultural groups what's<br>the best way to do so and I'm also<br>really interested to understand our<br>perception of time<br>time perspective and how it impacts our<br>daily life and I'll talk briefly about<br>this soon<br>um I'm quite also interested in<br>understand the the role of context in<br>influence psychological phenomena<br>yeah so um for example recently we<br>published with colleagues Health<br>geographies from Christchurch looking at<br>how features of a neighborhood in New<br>Zealand impacts People's Health and<br>well-being yeah and I've done that<br>within schools contexts as well how<br>school's characteristics can impact kids<br>health and well-being<br>um<br>and so on so it's a really area that I'm<br>interested<br>I'm also really interested in cultural<br>similarities and variability<br>at the psychological phenomena that they<br>were experience emotions beliefs values<br>are similar across cultural groups<br>are they different why do they differ<br>yeah so some examples I have been<br>studying<br>self-identity across cultural groups<br>um we published this paper on relational<br>Mobility how easy or difficult it is to<br>make social connections and friendships<br>across cultures<br>um contextualism in itself how people<br>perceive the importance of context in<br>their lives<br>and more recently we published a paper<br>looking at beliefs in lack and<br>precognition across cultural groups<br>recently we experienced covid<br>um I I joined few projects and with<br>colleagues from<br>Auckland University one is Denny who is<br>there we publish a paper looking at the<br>effect of the first lockdown in people's<br>health and well-being with a larger<br>cultural group of recessions we look at<br>stress and worry and more recently<br>together with Danny again increasible we<br>look at the impact of the covid<br>experience on people's environmental<br>attitudes<br>and because now I'm talking about<br>environmental attitudes I'll go a little<br>understanding environmental problems is<br>quite broad within psychologists also<br>broad but I use a theoretical frame that<br>I really like and I want to share with<br>you<br>is the idea of psychological distance<br>so life situations are often removed in<br>time or space they pertain to others<br>experiences a hypothetical rather than<br>real when considering planning and<br>evaluating life situations we mentally<br>transverse psychological distance and<br>this is really key and important for us<br>because without this capacity will be<br>trapped under here and now so we need to<br>imagine other realities<br>has identified four main dimensions of<br>psychological distance so imagine that<br>you are there in the middle these are<br>the four dimensions spatial social<br>temporal and hypothetical<br>so things that are close to you are<br>psychologically near things that are far<br>apart psychologically distant<br>so for each of these we can put for<br>example in the social Dimension things<br>that are related to myself<br>it's about me and so it's<br>psychologically near close and when I<br>start thinking about others I<br>automatically increase distance because<br>I need to imagine how others are feeling<br>thinking and so on<br>so it has<br>cognitive implications<br>things that are close to us we tend to<br>experience them they tend to be concrete<br>and we construe them mentally in a low<br>level construe<br>in contrast things that are far away<br>from us they are abstract General and we<br>use a high level construo a mental<br>representation of those things<br>yeah<br>so I'll show how this can be important<br>to understand environmental problems but<br>first I want to illustrate how these<br>dimensions are related<br>is there anything wrong with this figure<br>there<br>Wrong Way Around yeah but there is no<br>right way<br>but<br>we unconsciously link dimensions of<br>psychological distance and you said is<br>the other way around<br>because there is a mismatch between two<br>dimensions of psychological distance the<br>social Dimension Us and Them<br>and the spatial Dimension the here and<br>there yeah so cognitively we want them<br>to match we wanted the eyes close to us<br>and that then far away from us yeah so<br>they are related<br>although we don't know why yeah but we<br>react when they don't when there is a<br>mismatch<br>so for many many years I've been arguing<br>that psychological distances distancing<br>is important for understanding and<br>addressing environmental problems I<br>argue that the extent to which<br>individual is perceive environmental<br>problems as a certain issue so the<br>hypothetical dimension<br>with effects in the here and now the<br>special in temporal<br>and to people like them the social<br>Dimension yeah so over the years I have<br>been exploring these dimensions in<br>relation to environmental issues today<br>I'll focus on the spatial dimension<br>there is a key find in the literature<br>related to these spatial Dimension is<br>that environmental problems tend to be<br>perceived as more worrying when they<br>take place at greater distances so it's<br>worse there than here<br>it was first observed in the 70s as far<br>as we know but has been documented in<br>other Publications and folks have used<br>different labels for it environmental<br>hyperopia was there then here better<br>here than there and the labor I prefer<br>to use is simpler spatial bias<br>in my Publications the first one the<br>first time I I observed this phenomenon<br>was a nice study in my PhD thesis so I<br>asked participants to rate the<br>seriousness of six environmental<br>problems in that community and also<br>worldwide and you can read the the six<br>environmental problems there and I found<br>that environmental problems are<br>perceived as more serious globally than<br>locally<br>the first major cross-country study was<br>led by Professor Robert Gifford from<br>Canada in 2009<br>and across 18 countries they observe<br>that people tend to believe<br>environmental problems are also there<br>than here and in this study they used<br>three levels local level National level<br>and Global level and across<br>uh most of this sample is 18 samples<br>environmental problems are perceived<br>worse there than here<br>but there is a gap they didn't include<br>New Zealand uh sample so I did a study<br>we collect<br>um two New Zealand samples and we also<br>found and confirmed this bias that new<br>zealanders tend to perceive<br>environmental problems as was there than<br>here<br>and then in my first sabbatical I want<br>to explore that a little bit further and<br>I worked with a professor Wesley shouts<br>from California<br>and in this publication we had some 30<br>samples<br>from 26 countries so much larger sample<br>than the 18 and 19 plus in New Zealand<br>study<br>um and we also want to see if<br>um because one might argue that well<br>this is not a bias people know the the<br>context and they know that environmental<br>problems are worse there than here so<br>you want to check if it was a factual<br>knowledge that people had or bias<br>so I'm not going to go into detail here<br>but we use this environmental<br>sustainability index<br>is a objective index developed by<br>experts in Eau Universe there are nine<br>indicators so it's not based on people's<br>judgment but uh objective measure of<br>environmental sustainability<br>and we plot these real objective measure<br>with the people's perception of the<br>reality in the locality<br>and if it wasn't a bias these two lines<br>would match but you can see that the<br>subjective line is above the objective<br>line illustrating that<br>people's perception of environmental<br>problems does not does not match the<br>true reality yeah<br>um but the main point here is that we<br>observed across these samples apart from<br>Romania was the outlier there that<br>people tend to believe environmental<br>problems are worse there than here<br>so recently I went a bit further and say<br>what about if I study a single country<br>and I collect data across all states in<br>Brazil these numbers there are the<br>sample size in each state<br>and I did with a colleague uh Rob from<br>Wellington who now lives in Japan<br>and we found exactly the same Brazilians<br>tend to believe environmental problems<br>are worse nationally<br>than locally and we argue that it's a<br>bias because your state belongs to the<br>country<br>yeah your country belongs<br>globally<br>so if everyone believes that's worse<br>dead in here it's a bias yeah<br>so we've been arguing that special bias<br>is perhaps a plausible psychological<br>Universal so it's cognitively available<br>to people in many cultural groups and we<br>have shown across Nations but also<br>within a continent-sized country in<br>Brazil<br>so it seems that perhaps is a judgment<br>process similar to self-adder<br>comparisons they're quite well<br>established finding inside College<br>um these self-serving bias<br>or we call above average or comparative<br>optimism effects people tend to believe<br>they are better than average in many<br>things they are better looking than<br>average they are smarter than average<br>and so on or negatively they are less<br>likely to have a car accident less<br>likely to have a heart attack and so on<br>but if everyone believes that there is<br>no average yes because everyone believes<br>they are better looking smart and so on<br>so we tend to believe that it's the same<br>process operating there so we argue that<br>functionally it may save that as an<br>awareness buffer of the severity of<br>environmental problems in one's local<br>area so a place serving bias is better<br>to believe that the problems there not<br>here<br>yeah<br>but as you can guess this is<br>consequential because it can reduce<br>people's motivation to act if I believe<br>environmental problems I was there not<br>here<br>why should I care let them care yeah<br>because I'm distancing myself from the<br>issue so it comes the idea of<br>psychological distance again<br>and I'll illustrate that with a study we<br>did<br>um<br>this as you know the map of New Zealand<br>these little black dots are participants<br>and we highlight the largest locations<br>of participants Auckland and crashes and<br>we want to see if People's proximity to<br>um and we use the gis as a technology to<br>map where people live and calculate the<br>closest point to the Shoreline and we<br>want to replicate in our island nation<br>in New Zealand because Studies have<br>shown this effect in the US but in U.S<br>for you to live in the coastline it's<br>quite hard because a really large<br>country so we want to try to test if<br>there is this effect of proximity to the<br>coast in people's environmental<br>orientations in an island nation country<br>and we found in these National<br>probability sample using data from the<br>New Zealand attitudes and values study<br>that people living closer to the<br>Shoreline<br>Express greater belief that climate<br>change is real<br>and greatest support for government<br>regulation of carbon emissions<br>so we argue that physical Place plays a<br>role in the psychological acceptance of<br>environmental problems perhaps because<br>the effects become more concrete and<br>local so it reduced psychological<br>distance<br>or spatial bias<br>and I believe this is what we experience<br>after the Cyclone we had in New Zealand<br>these affected areas people live in<br>those regions<br>are much more aware of the consequence<br>of the cyclone and they might be much<br>more willing to support action than<br>people who live in other regions of the<br>country<br>the problem for us is to translate this<br>across locality because we know<br>environmental problems are affecting<br>everyone yeah<br>recently was there<br>but most likely it's going to happen<br>okay so current and future directions<br>this I I mentioned the privileged<br>Underdog identity that I carry<br>and this is another code that carries my<br>work<br>washing one's hands of the conflict<br>between the powerful and the paralyzed<br>means to side with the powerful not to<br>be neutral<br>there is no political neutrality<br>yeah<br>Paulo Freddy is from my hometown from<br>penaboku and it's really special to be<br>talking about him today here because in<br>Brazil if you talk about his name<br>you are communist<br>it's so unbelievably stupid and crazy<br>that I had to to mention this here<br>so amazing intellectual<br>who wants to help others<br>but helping others is not positively<br>seen nowadays<br>um his work influences I I although I'm<br>not working in you know in education<br>broadly or teaching teachers<br>um or future teachers he's teaching is<br>really impactful in my career in the way<br>I work and try to help others and<br>collaborate with others<br>but if you don't want to think about<br>Paulo Freddy look at our Education Act<br>says that we have academic freedom<br>not only academics but students and we<br>should use academic freedom<br>and that universities accept a role as<br>critic and conscience of society<br>and I think it is a really beautiful and<br>Powerful here in New Zealand in our<br>context is to use the privilege we have<br>at universities to further knowledge but<br>also to criticize what's happening okay<br>within the law of course<br>so in my work I've been looking at the<br>politics and sociology of science as<br>well<br>so for example the Matthew effect<br>that powerful academics tend to bring<br>more money more resource to to him or<br>her<br>and now as a professor I'm questioning<br>my position<br>no I don't want to be this Catalyst of<br>bringing more power to me but allocating<br>Distributing power to others<br>which leads to this idea of Iraqi our<br>power relations<br>so being a known English speaker many<br>times I submit a manuscript and say the<br>English is not really good<br>and I had to really work really hard and<br>I understand the fact criticism<br>um but it's from a hierarchical<br>perspective not from an educational<br>perspective<br>coming from a non-top university people<br>just reject your work<br>coming from New Zealand many colleagues<br>have experienced that from New Zealand<br>who cares data from New Zealand who<br>cares you know knowing what New<br>Zealand's felt during the pandemic<br>it's a small country<br>but if you have data from the US<br>very well<br>many many times so we've been<br>challenging these really strongly<br>and the power in the language you know<br>I'm American because America is the<br>continent it's not a country<br>yeah so these languages are really<br>powerful it carry power relations and<br>then constantly challenging<br>and also these shifting goal posts I<br>have experienced this so so much in my<br>career I've seen<br>people being introduced and say well<br>look at this person<br>he or she published in this genre and I<br>said wow okay so I need to publish in<br>that journal and I publish in that John<br>I say yeah<br>it's okay<br>oh that person has these number of<br>citations so oh I need to have citations<br>and I get the citations<br>yeah not okay<br>why why is that<br>so in question is constantly corruption<br>in scientific dishonesty and there are<br>many levels here<br>you know the abusing of entrusted power<br>for private gain actually corruption<br>within universe and with this science<br>intentionally not citing studies because<br>from Brazil from India<br>who cares<br>not acknowledging original Source or<br>ideas this person had his original idea<br>I can collaborate with him or her or<br>bring her you know or acknowledge the<br>idea in my work<br>so I'm trying to focus on how to<br>replicate you know I'll I'll be Beyond<br>challenge these things<br>um how to replicate<br>studies and and focus on open science<br>it's a broad movement within psychology<br>and science more broadly<br>but I've been published<br>in corruption<br>look at jaitin brazilero Brazilian is<br>our way of navigating bureaucracy and<br>Iraqi in Brazilian similar to pulling<br>strings that you have you know in<br>English context<br>but it's quite more prevalent in Brazil<br>and looking at corruption more<br>explicitly yeah and fascinates me how<br>the word corruption is hardly used in<br>the New Zealand context<br>but again it's a power relation is is<br>easier to say well corruption happens<br>there<br>yeah<br>not here<br>but pretty much every day when I read<br>the news things as well in Brazil we<br>label this corruption but here you just<br>avoid the word<br>yeah<br>and more recently I'm trying to<br>understand the impact of Human Rights<br>I believe the Declaration of Human<br>Rights a really powerful historically<br>and socially<br>and we are taken for granted<br>and I think we need to recognize how<br>important that document is how powerful<br>it is so I'm looking at Human Rights<br>broadly but also indigenous rights with<br>Maori colleagues<br>and finally recently I joined the<br>ministry for the environment I'm on a<br>two-year uh<br>fixed term position<br>on a behavior insight's lead within a<br>small but really effective team system<br>change and capability<br>it's a great opportunity to apply<br>psychological knowledge to policy design<br>and implementation that hopefully will<br>have decades-long implications to our<br>country</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
