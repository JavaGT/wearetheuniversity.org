Tim Dorrian (Co-Founder and Managing Director of Aro Digital) shares why there's no better place than Wellington to be an innovator or entrepreneur.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>There's a lot of challenges in the world <br>at the moment and the only way we're  <br>going to be able to make it through those <br>challenges is with game-changing solutions.<br>That's where innovation and <br>entrepreneurship really comes in.<br>It helps you understand where <br>the biggest problems are,  <br>and how to tackle them in the easiest <br>way possible, to adopt massive change  <br>and actually start to address those <br>challenges that we're facing as a planet.<br>Kia ora, my name is Tim Dorrian and I'm <br>the managing director of Aro Digital.<br>I studied a Bachelor of Arts in <br>Sociology as well as a Bachelor of  <br>Commerce in Marketing and International Business.<br>Innovation and entrepreneurship for me is all <br>about reframing challenges into opportunities.<br>Getting that lens of what even is the biggest <br>challenge or the biggest problem that your  <br>organisation, or even in your personal life <br>that you're facing, really helps to frame  <br>up what the solution might be and how you <br>might be able to make progress towards that.<br>So I think the thing that most people think <br>of when they're thinking about innovation  <br>and entrepreneurship is that it only makes sense <br>for people who are starting their own business.<br>I don't think that's actually the case.<br>Every single business and organisation can <br>really value innovation and the way that  <br>it gives a new lens into the challenges <br>that an organisation might be facing.<br>So you don't have to be starting a business to be  <br>able to find innovation and <br>entrepreneurship valuable.<br>When you hear about innovation <br>and entrepreneurship, especially  <br>when you're getting started, it can sound <br>really scary, it can sound really advanced.<br>But at the end of the day, innovation <br>and entrepreneurship is all about people.<br>It's about understanding how they operate <br>and how they're going to adopt new solutions,  <br>really helping them make their lives better and <br>all of the innovation that you see around you,  <br>that that's what it's about. <br>It's about making lives better.<br>Wellington's in a really unique position where <br>there's a perfect storm of government, businesses,  <br>charities, organisations, and universities that <br>create this melting pot of culture and ideas.<br>Being an innovator, or being an entrepreneur <br>in Wellington allows you to get exposure to all  <br>those different groups of people and really <br>accelerates your ability to make change,  <br>because you're not just working with <br>businesses, you might be working with  <br>government organisations, or social <br>enterprises, maybe charities as well.<br>That can really fast track your <br>ability to make a difference.<br>Innovation is the only way forward <br>as we progress as a society.<br>If we're not innovating, we're going to get <br>left behind and if we really want to tackle  <br>the biggest challenges that this planet's <br>facing, innovation, and in my opinion,  <br>entrepreneurship, the commercialisation <br>of those ideas is the only way forward.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
