a tour around the speech science clinics.<br><br>Find out more here;

are oh there she is hello okay<br>how's it going I'm good<br>hello we're in the Grafton Clinic with<br>Katie is it that's all right Katie my<br>name is Rodolfo it's so nice to meet you<br>and it's so nice to be here in this<br>amazing brand new building was it like<br>built yesterday or something yeah pretty<br>close it was built the year before I<br>started yeah three years ago cool you<br>work in speech science so there's a lot<br>of sound and listening and talking<br>involved but tell me a little bit more<br>about like what's it's all about from<br>your perspective sure<br>um so speech science is essentially<br>learning how people use speech and<br>language to communicate with each other<br>and to connect with each other<br>um because language is really how we<br>form relationships which plays a big<br>part in how we participate in life and<br>where our happiness comes from there is<br>some children who might have language<br>delays so they're not learning language<br>as quickly as the other children their<br>age some adults might have had Strokes<br>or brain injuries and that can all<br>affect their ability to use language and<br>that can have an effect on how they're<br>able to connect with people around them<br>and can lead to them feelings related<br>and so it starts to become concerning<br>that if a child is showing signs that<br>they might not be learning as quickly as<br>the others around them that they'll<br>start to fall behind and then it can<br>happen quite like exponentially and so<br>our job as speech language therapists is<br>we want to be experts in language and<br>how children learn language so that we<br>can support them to help them get to the<br>same stage as their peers and then that<br>obviously has impacts for them later on<br>in life and their ability to function in<br>society sounds like you're doing really<br>good money really good research should<br>we go check out the clinics yep<br>absolutely all right shall we go yep so<br>we're gonna go into the left here so<br>come on in oh cool yeah this is the<br>clinic that I use when I'm working with<br>the kids in the University Clinic we<br>love using dolls when we work with kids<br>it's a lot easier for kids to learn<br>language when they have something they<br>can see and touch and some that looks<br>like a real person what's going on with<br>this weird looking orb thing am I yeah<br>so this is actually camera because what<br>we do is we record all of our sessions<br>oh yeah hey there so this just looks<br>like a mirror from this side of the wall<br>but actually what the children don't<br>know is there's speech science students<br>and supervisors who are sitting on the<br>other side of the wall I wonder if<br>there's any in there right now yeah well<br>we've got a spy in here would you watch<br>sort of someone who's fully trained sort<br>of do it and then give them feedback or<br>them yeah some questions and stuff yeah<br>so when we start the degree we start<br>doing clinics almost immediately even<br>before we've learned a lot of theory<br>right and so often we'll watch our<br>supervisors so professional slts doing<br>working with the clients first and then<br>as we learn more and become more<br>experienced over the two years we start<br>taking more on responsibility until by<br>the end of the degree so what I'm doing<br>now you'll have multiple kids you're<br>seeing a day and the supervisor won't<br>even necessarily be you know she's not<br>in the room and she'll kind of leave you<br>to your own devices oh that sounds very<br>scary actually what do you think about<br>um it's great to learn from observation<br>but you learn so much more from doing so<br>so cool that's what comes next and yeah<br>you talk to adults as well you work with<br>adults we do yeah so we have another<br>room similar to this that's more set up<br>for adults cool so I can go thank you so<br>much enjoy your studies so this is the<br>room that we often use for them oh wow<br>so we come on in as you can see toys<br>yeah it's a little differently set up uh<br>we call it the Ikea room because all the<br>furniture kind of looks like it comes<br>from Ikea yeah um a lot of us therapy<br>with adults is much more talking based<br>right than with kids yeah and you can<br>see we have the same thing we have a<br>camera<br>and we have our mirror the two-way<br>mirror and an observation room on the<br>other side of that yeah<br>right here we actually have our voice<br>and swallowing Clinic with another<br>speech language therapist<br>okay what is going on here what so<br>what's your name<br>my name is Rodolfo hi tell us about this<br>uh wonderful room this is like I'll<br>swallow and wise lab led by Dr Anna<br>Meyers senior election speech signs I'm<br>in my final year doing PhD in speech<br>time wow basically I'm doing a clinical<br>randomized clinical trial with the<br>individual with Parkinson's disease and<br>then I'm doing a wise therapy and a<br>muscle strength training to improve<br>their voice and swallow cough function<br>tell us about all this important and<br>very cool looking technology what what<br>actually happens in this room so this is<br>about a computerized speech lab that<br>says voice quality and voice parameters<br>this is a spirometry cough study so we<br>used to assess the cough strength of<br>patients oh okay this is a little<br>instrument is called video stroboscopy<br>so we put an endoscope uh and see your<br>throat and then see your vocal cord<br>function structure whether they intact<br>or not this is a very new assessment in<br>our field called high resolution<br>impedance manometry wow so here you put<br>a catheter through your nostrils and<br>then all the way into the stomach and<br>then give some liquids for patients and<br>then see how the muscle contracts so<br>darker the high pressure Zone and the<br>lighter the low pressure wow so<br>basically like you will understand more<br>about the muscle function cool so it's<br>like a very intense Karma test<br>now tell us about this electric chair<br>what's the survival rate of this<br>no no like no adverse effects so far<br>okay don't worry tequila thank you so<br>much for introducing us to your amazing<br>room with all this new Cutting Edge<br>technology<br>um best of luck with the rest of your<br>oh here he is hello<br>okay Calvin your PhD student is that<br>right yeah that's right yes I'm I'm at<br>the end of my PhD<br>um I've been working between speech<br>science and School of Music The Voice<br>Department there I'm specifically<br>looking at objective measures for<br>singing voice analysis for diagnosis of<br>any voice complaint we actually need<br>these objective measures to make sure<br>that we know what these complaints are<br>where they're coming from sometimes when<br>someone presents with a voice complaint<br>they're always perceptual and often the<br>client won't know what's happening or<br>why it's happening so in a way it's sort<br>of like a doctor's checkup except for<br>your singing yeah and you but we don't<br>have a tool like that right now for that<br>exactly yeah so there's no protocol to<br>work with singers in the clinic anywhere<br>in the world oh so that's what I'm sort<br>of looking at establishing cool so how<br>do you use this particular room or<br>indeed that room as well for your<br>research<br>in the the sound booth what I do is a<br>participants come in and I um they get<br>sometimes to warm up and then we also I<br>record them them singing performing some<br>tasks and we've also got a device in<br>there that can measure air flow and<br>pressure during phonation can you just<br>tell us a little bit more about how your<br>research specifically ties into the<br>psychology you know any dysfunction in<br>The Voice<br>really affects quality of life and<br>especially for voice professionals it's<br>affecting if self-esteem efficacy all of<br>those things that can really have a<br>negative impact on quality of life and<br>our social interactions with others as<br>well you're at the end of your PhD<br>almost that sounds like so<br>congratulations first of all<br>um but what's next for you what are you<br>going to do next I've actually got a<br>research project coming up really lined<br>up looking at the voice characteristics<br>of Maori speakers in New Zealand<br>specifically and then looking to to<br>maybe move a bit further afield or<br>continued research I'm about to go into<br>my PhD I'm thinking about going into PhD<br>in Clinical Psychology and do you have<br>any advice for me or others who are sort<br>of going to postgrad and thinking about<br>that pathway as well like don't beat<br>yourself up if you find yourself<br>procrastinating every now and then okay<br>procrastination can lead to like really<br>great productivity so just Embrace those<br>moments if you need a bit of rest take<br>it and then when you feel like it's time<br>to write and you can really write don't<br>try to kind of conform to what you think<br>you should be doing if writing 100 words<br>a day doesn't work for you don't do it<br>don't just don't don't not do it just do<br>it differently do it differently but<br>don't know yeah it's like it doesn't<br>work for you because it sounds like I<br>just watched the video why are you<br>telling all the students to progress<br>oh so Katie thank you so much for<br>introducing me to this wonderful<br>facility speech salad sounds so cool I<br>mean where did we go we went to child<br>Clinic adult Clinic voice and swallowing<br>and a singing Booth they look like so<br>that's really cool but for you<br>specifically you're at the end of your<br>Masters so congratulations almost there<br>thank you but what's next for you<br>research doing the clinical exams and<br>then looking for grad jobs so everyone<br>in my cohort right now we're looking for<br>jobs it might be<br>um looking to work in the hospital next<br>year or working with the Ministry of<br>Education in schools and the great thing<br>about it is there's so many areas that<br>you can go into<br>um so it's an exciting time and for you<br>specifically do you have any angling<br>where you want to go who you want to<br>work with<br>yeah well I think because of my<br>background in singing I've always been<br>quite interested in voice so it would be<br>nice to end up there someday<br>um but at the moment I'm quite<br>interested to just apply to lots of jobs<br>and see what happens next year see where<br>you land that sounds like a plan well<br>thank you so much again for taking me on<br>this Whirlwind tour with all the best<br>thank you again<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
