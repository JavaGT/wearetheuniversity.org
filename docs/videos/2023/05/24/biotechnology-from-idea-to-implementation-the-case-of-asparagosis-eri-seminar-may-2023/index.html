Strategies to mitigate ruminant methanogenesis include the use of methanogen inhibitors and seaweed from the genus Asparagopsis, when included at very low levels in the feed of cattle and sheep, inhibits methanogenesis by up to 98% with evidence of improvements in feed utilisation efficiency. This has resulted in an increasing interest in and demand for these seaweeds globally. In response, research is progressing rapidly to facilitate Asparagopsis cultivation at large scale, and to develop aquaculture production systems to enable a high quality and consistent supply chain. In this presentation, I will talk about the journey from idea and discovery through to commercial implementation endeavours around the use of Asparagopsis seaweed for methane mitigation.<br><br>Dr. Marie Magnusson is an Associate Professor at the University of Waikato.

welcome to the dri seminar for today<br>we're really lucky today to have<br>associate professor Marie Magnuson who's<br>based here in Tauranga with us at the<br>Coastal Marine Field Station<br>um and Marie's going to be talking about<br>asparagopsis so Marie's been working on<br>seaweed or algae for many years now<br>pretty much all of her professional<br>career<br>um she did her PhD at James Scott<br>University in Townsville in Australia<br>looking at microalgae and ecotoxicology<br>ecotoxicology sorry and then after that<br>she moved into a postdoc a various<br>research fellow positions where she was<br>working on industry-led projects on<br>algal biotechnology and bioproducts<br>um initially on microalgae but then<br>moving to seaweeds and macro algae and<br>involved in some really neat things one<br>of those was the development of<br>asparagopsis it's a methane<br>mitigator uh the to mitigate me pain<br>emissions from cattle and Marie's going<br>to talk about that today the journey<br>right from the original discovery of the<br>potential of asparagopsis um to where<br>we've got to so take it away Marie<br>awesome thank you very much for that<br>introduction Rebecca that saved me a bit<br>um very good so they were pretty much<br>the things that I was going to start<br>with um um here as well so when we talk<br>about algal biotechnology a lot of<br>people think that things are going to<br>happen really fast and there's all this<br>urgency so I'm just going to take a step<br>back this um uh this kind of started<br>really like 11 12 years ago and so this<br>is the the whole journey that I will<br>talk to you about today so it's going to<br>be pretty um high level no not those<br>ones<br>Mouse hmm<br>and that that one works um<br>so before we sort of go into the actual<br>detail of the science<br>um I want to talk a little bit about the<br>value of uh of the ruminant industry so<br>I just pulled out some data from New<br>Zealand<br>now where the export value of um beef<br>and dairy is projected to reach about 30<br>um five billion dollars by 2024 uh<br>employing nearly 150 000 people in New<br>Zealand directly<br>um and also supporting a whole raft of<br>other connected Industries and also<br>um in some places entire communities so<br>it's clearly a really critical<br>um industry<br>uh in New Zealand and it's the same in<br>Australia where this work started where<br>um probably a business is bigger than<br>wool but but<br>um the room in the industry is is a<br>large part of the um of society<br>but of course there's the um the uh the<br>gases elephant in the room greenhouse<br>gas emissions are quite large from<br>ruminants and so this is a graph from<br>the food and agricultural organization<br>showing basically the<br>um the global emissions of greenhouse<br>gases per kilo of protein produced from<br>a range of sources and really the<br>take-home messages that all the six top<br>graphs showing that various ruminants<br>have much higher per kilo protein<br>greenhouse gas emissions than the<br>monogastric animals<br>through at the at the bottom line<br>and this is because of uh ruminant<br>methanogenesis<br>um<br>and so when we're looking at agriculture<br>um stepping back from New Zealand data<br>looking at a global<br>global emissions about 40 of<br>um Mill fan emissions that comes from<br>anthropogenic sources stem from<br>Agriculture and about 40 of those<br>emissions come from<br>um interior fermentation<br>sorry I got a tickle I got up<br>I got<br>um a coffee<br>um<br>and<br>um the source of this<br>Roman methanogenesis is uh because of<br>the way the rumen and the cat the<br>digestive system or the animals uh are<br>designed uh where the animals it's<br>really fibrous carbohydrate-rich<br>material that is fermented in the rumen<br>by by microbes so bacteria protozoa<br>fungi and viruses<br>fermented into volatile fatty acids<br>which I'm going to call vfas through the<br>rest of the talk<br>um and this vfas are the source of<br>nutrition for um for the ruminants along<br>with all the microbial Protein that's um<br>can I produce during microbial growth in<br>the rumen uh positive food<br>um get past the room and into the other<br>parts of the digestive tract where it's<br>kind of simulated the way that's in in<br>um in monogastric um animals as well so<br>one thing um during this process this<br>carbon dioxide and hydrogen that's<br>produced and if there weren't any<br>methanogens<br>um<br>uh in here a lot of this would a lot of<br>these gases would be redirected back<br>into producing more<br>um uh vfas so back into the fermentation<br>process but methanogans they're really<br>highly competitive for these substrate<br>and they use them to produce their own<br>energy through methane production<br>and so<br>that will have relevance later<br>so just remember that um and then most<br>of this new phone is erupted burped out<br>um by by the animal<br>and so what do we do about this<br>um so we can obviously replacement found<br>this smells looking for pictures gonna<br>try some bull free beef<br>um I'm gonna go grocery shopping this<br>week um<br>uh we can reduce the herd<br>um sort of obviously sort of really<br>direct direct<br>um<br>uh responses<br>but what we can do in the meantime while<br>these things are you know these changes<br>in society are<br>are happening to um to move sufficiently<br>far away in<br>um<br>ruminum production to<br>um to make a material difference we can<br>just reduce work on on<br>methods to reduce methanogenesis a so<br>it's a range of different Alternatives<br>um available or in the process of being<br>available so people are working on<br>vaccines selective breeding antibiotics<br>nutritional strategies<br>um<br>and also different food inclusions and<br>additives and here's where seaweed comes<br>in<br>so this is kind of the origin story<br>um of asparagus I should have put a tape<br>on here<br>um and it kind of all started with the<br>serendipitous coming together of uh<br>rocker Denice at James Cook University<br>um uh so Rocky is uh it was<br>traditionally by training um a seaweed<br>natural products chemist and Nigel uh<br>EXO ruminant specialist and so they<br>started talking about you know their<br>various Fields um<br>and at the time myself and Nick Paul<br>were working with rocket and ice and we<br>all uh recruited a lovely Lorena in<br>white lab coat here so she was our first<br>two students who started in 2012 and a<br>lot of this work is um it's her work so<br>she did all that groundbreaking uh work<br>um under our supervision and her thesis<br>aim was to look at the potential of<br>macro algae to mitigate methane<br>and basically the first all the steps on<br>the number one here Apostle lorenas uh<br>thesis so the whole the whole process<br>from idea to implementation is kind of<br>outlined here so um we were doing uh in<br>vitro trials to identify activity of<br>seaweed and freshwater algae actually as<br>well<br>once we found activity we were looking<br>at dose responses trying to find the<br>active compound and looking at the<br>response in the rumen uh and verifying<br>effects and safety in um in Viva trials<br>in animals moving on to working at<br>products<br>um stability and processing options and<br>uh onto farming protocols which we're<br>kind of working on actually here at<br>um<br>uh and so we go back to those sort of<br>initial<br>um early trials Lorena was testing<br>around 20 um different algal species<br>both fresh water<br>um green brown and red algae but<br>asparagobs is highlighted in red<br>it was the one species that had uh<br>really inhibited methane uh emissions<br>which is on the y axis in this um in<br>vitro trial so you can see the<br>uh<br>uh little jars with uh<br>cloudy fluid which is taken from the<br>rumen of fistulated cows that were<br>upstairs that's csiro maintained that<br>was the photo of<br>Lorena earlier where they really<br>reaching into<br>um to the side in this into the side of<br>of the Beast to to scoop out room and<br>fluid<br>um<br>um<br>so you can see from that graph as well<br>that all this business had lower both<br>um total gas production and also methane<br>production dander control which is DCs<br>which is the corticated Cotton Sid which<br>is one of the basal foods that I use<br>quite commonly in um in Australia but<br>the most effective species was<br>aspergopsis that led to more than 99<br>reduction of methane<br>production we also tested the biochemic<br>the biochemistry in terms of nutritional<br>components and and all sorts of things a<br>whole raft of um different components<br>that we analyzed in all the algae that<br>we tested but there was no correlation<br>between anything that we tested and the<br>fermentation parameters that we measured<br>and so we've concluded that any effect<br>was likely to be due to secondary<br>metabolites<br>and so the photo here is of Aspergers a<br>lot of the love stages this is one of um<br>Elizabeth's photos I pitched a student<br>here now at UW and you can see there's<br>round little dots on on the photo where<br>the arrows are pointing to and they are<br>the gland cells which are basically<br>through chemical factories<br>um that are just full of a whole raft of<br>secondary metabolites in in its drug<br>offices<br>important thing that we found in this<br>first studies were that the volatile<br>fatty acid<br>production was nearly halved in the<br>asphalogopsis treatments and if you<br>remember what I said earlier is that the<br>vfas are the actual nutrition that the<br>cows can simulate that the animals can<br>assimilate into their body so this is<br>this is really critical we can't see the<br>animal something that will take away<br>half of their nutrition that's not going<br>to be<br>um sustainable<br>um so then we moved on to trying out a<br>range of various doses to see if we can<br>find<br>um a better a better dose<br>and this is really small because it's<br>not really that critical what we the<br>actual doses but we tested from less<br>than a percent up to 16 which was the<br>dose we originally tried and this the 16<br>was kind of arbitrary because normally<br>when you do feeding Solutions in those<br>fermentation bottles you add<br>um your ad 0.2 grams of the substrate<br>you're trying to test together with one<br>gram of the<br>um basal food and this is the standard<br>protocol and so that's what we were<br>doing and it ended up being 16 of<br>organic matter<br>and we went down from there<br>um the important thing from this graph<br>is so you got the total gas production<br>on the top grass and um<br>medicine production on the bottom graph<br>and all the doses of uh asparagosis<br>um above one percent of the organic<br>matter had nearly complete reduction of<br>methane<br>um in them and on your top right here is<br>the organic matter degradability this is<br>a really important parameter for fluid<br>inclusion as well I know some of those<br>really high doses where that<br>degradability was different from the<br>controls<br>and on the bottom right is the vfa<br>production and while there's still less<br>vfa production in the one<br>um percent<br>dose you can see that there is a dose<br>response there so the critical thing<br>here was that small doses are still<br>really potent and decreasing the dose<br>led to uh reduced negative effects on<br>these fermentation parameters so it's<br>really worthwhile to keep pursuing this<br>so we then moved on to<br>um some lovely chemistry doing some<br>classical essay guarded fractionation<br>where we were using a range of solvents<br>to extract<br>the biomass uh testing this extracts in<br>that same Roman<br>um uh in vitro assay and then from the<br>extract that showed activity we're<br>quantifying the amounts of the range of<br>different metabolites<br>and then we took<br>um the same<br>um<br>amount of both biomass extract and pure<br>compounds of the main metabolites to<br>test back into that<br>um bioassay<br>um beautiful science<br>and we found that there were other<br>compounds that were in the form that had<br>um<br>so bremiform and diabromo chloromethane<br>division both had really high<br>um uh effect in reducing methane<br>production by bromiforms the only<br>compound that was present in high enough<br>concentrations in the biomass to<br>actually have that effect<br>um<br>in in the assays so we concluded a<br>bromoform is the main metabolite that<br>drives this anti-metronogenic effect<br>and that<br>we could now take the dose down to low<br>enough that we could have near complete<br>methane inhibition with no effect on<br>those important fermentation parameters<br>like volatile fatty acid production<br>there's a few other things that we test<br>for as well<br>um but um that's the kind of most<br>um for Lorena's Final Chapter she<br>um was looking at the Roman microbial<br>response so because we're<br>visiting the castle something that's<br>quite foreign to them uh and we're<br>having a really large effect on their<br>digestion right we really want to kind<br>of find out where is this effect coming<br>from and how might it affect animals<br>um uh real animals before we go to to<br>try this um in Vivo and so she was again<br>doing those uh bottle in vitro assays<br>and doing qpcr next-gen sequencing and<br>lots of lots of<br>um cell counts to identifying accounts<br>and so on and just to kind of to<br>identify<br>um what effects different doses of<br>asparagus and the pure<br>compounds uh we'll have on the Roman<br>microbiome<br>and so this uh grass here the last one<br>shows the methane production at the<br>various doses so the axis disappear but<br>it's the same as on the left on their<br>right<br>and the right graph shows the relative<br>abundance of this is specifically just<br>the methanogens<br>um so just a tiny part of this study<br>um but basically you can see that in all<br>the treatments where there was an effect<br>on lithium production there was a<br>reduction in the abundance of um uh<br>methanogenic bacteria<br>and so while<br>bacteria on your right hand graph so<br>what we do with this essay you kind of<br>take samples through time<br>um and so here I plotted uh 48 and 72<br>hours and so after 48 hours<br>you've got lower abundance of<br>um methanogenic bacteria then after<br>seven or two hours so after they've kind<br>of used stuffed that first dose they<br>start to<br>um creep back up again in abundance but<br>there's still after seven or two hours<br>you can kind of see that there's a<br>little bit of Nissan um production<br>um<br>and so<br>looking back at previous literature<br>um uh as well so this is this is big I'm<br>gonna not really go into this pretty<br>complex<br>um<br>um cycle this is<br>um the wolf cycle that shows how<br>um methane is produced pretty much but<br>basically broniform competitively binds<br>with cobalamin which is part of this uh<br>wolf cycle up in steps um six and seven<br>uh we at bro I'm a form inhibits this<br>key methyl transfer steps in<br>methanogenesis and this means that<br>methane production is<br>um uh is reduced so that the the<br>bacteria's energy production is um is<br>reduced so that will reduce their<br>competitive advantage in taking all this<br>uh hydrogen and CO2 that's produced in<br>um in the rumen uh and so now this can<br>be made available uh for the rest of the<br>room and microbiome to produce more<br>volatile fatty acids so there is a<br>chance that there will be increased food<br>conversion efficiency and therefore also<br>higher animal production from<br>from bases that are fed asparagus<br>because this the methane production is<br>is is basically accounts for an energy<br>loss for the animal that nutrients that<br>they can actually use for growth um out<br>and this is pretty busy this is from a<br>recent review<br>um that we did here<br>entertainment so in terms of all this<br>individual studies we did early invivor<br>Charles Lorena actually did a couple of<br>charts but we only had four beasts to<br>work with and so<br>um her results did not<br>um we didn't publish those but they were<br>used for a patent application<br>and those results actually were part of<br>demonstrating that we might expect to<br>see uh increases in<br>uh in productivity in the system<br>and so the typo message is here<br>basically there's been a raft of studies<br>now in Vivo uh using looking<br>um at both<br>cattle and dairy cows and highlighted in<br>these circles are the various inclusion<br>levels and um uh of asparagopsis and<br>this has been both asperg up to samatha<br>which is a temperate species and asberg<br>office taxiformis which is a um a<br>tropical species and the one that we<br>started doing all this work with and you<br>can see this there's quite a range of<br>concentrations and um and additions<br>which has also LED them to a range of<br>um of responses is the percent uh change<br>in methane uh the right hand circles the<br>percent change in most fan production<br>uh within that study and so you can see<br>that the actual the dose and and<br>therefore the concentration of uh<br>bromiform that you're giving the animal<br>is really critical<br>um and you can also see that um there's<br>still<br>um the jurors out whether there will be<br>axel<br>productivity increases in uh in a in a<br>Vivo system<br>um so for the first cattle there was up<br>to uh 50 yeah up to 50 increases in<br>field conversion uh rashes and<br>productivity increases um but it was<br>really quite variable between the<br>animals um<br>so it's a little bit there was a a very<br>strong Trend but but in the end<br>inconclusive<br>um and for dairy Kettle there was<br>actually indications that there's a<br>decrease in productivity and here we're<br>looking at milk sometimes yields<br>sometimes milk protein in the yield and<br>things so there's a few different things<br>that you can look at but um the taker<br>message is I guess that the jury is<br>um<br>and it will kind of depend on that<br>uh the basal seed and and the the<br>production system<br>um<br>part of looking at the effects in favor<br>is looking at the animal safety<br>um and so just looking at um<br>uh whether whether adding grammar form<br>to<br>um a food will have uh and a detrimental<br>effects to the animal apart from that<br>effect that it exerts directly in the<br>room<br>um<br>there's there's a really really low risk<br>because of the low inclusion levels that<br>are effective so conservatively a<br>a beef steer during its lifetime or a<br>milking cow over a three-year production<br>um<br>time span they will consume less from a<br>form than half the lethal half day acute<br>lethal dose for a rat<br>and that's over three years time so they<br>get very very little<br>um<br>also because first stop is the room and<br>where all the methanogens are actually<br>um binding and breaking down<br>um the bromiform various very little<br>risks that there should be anything<br>um that that reaches sort of systemic<br>levels out in the other body parts<br>um<br>uh and so far there's been no detection<br>of bromoform in tissue edible awful fat<br>or fecal matter at this minimum<br>effective inclusion levels<br>at really high levels or for animals<br>that were really stressed sort of switch<br>house that didn't actually want to um<br>eat anything<br>um there has been detection of Brahma<br>form in milk<br>so there has been some transfer and also<br>in in another recent study on very uh<br>cows there's been bramiform detected in<br>the milk but at levels that are 50 to<br>100 times lower than the safe drinking<br>water<br>levels from the World Health<br>um sometimes it's probably easier to<br>spell things out than to try and<br>abbreviate it<br>um and so there's so so this we actually<br>get Brahma form as a byproduct of<br>um sterilizing uh water so there's<br>bromoform and drinking water and in your<br>showers and a lot of the<br>um analytical methods for detecting<br>bromoform in liquids uh developed for<br>detecting them in drinking water and in<br>uh in human breast milk from exposure in<br>in showers<br>so we're exposed to this kind of<br>um all the time<br>and so basically we typically tend to<br>drink more water than uh than than the<br>dairy we consume as well so<br>um these are really levels there are<br>safe safe for the animal and safe for<br>consumption<br>so we're looking at all this um<br>coming back to the dose the dose and<br>response so all the work that has been<br>done<br>um up to well some of those in Viva<br>trials I've been using other methods but<br>then most of the individual trials and<br>all the individual trials will be using<br>uh freeze-dried<br>um aspergopsis biomass and this is<br>really good for preserving material in<br>their kind of native state so from a<br>form is a volatile and if you try to um<br>dry it in in an oven you'll drive off<br>all the all the burner form and you<br>won't have anything left to fill your<br>cattle<br>um so but but first drying is a really<br>energy expensive process and it's not<br>really viable if you're going to feed<br>the New Zealand herd for example<br>so what we're doing then was looking at<br>different processing options for how to<br>retain the bromoform in the biomass<br>using other methods than freeze growing<br>and so this uh it's again pretty<br>um pretty busy basically we use 25<br>different treatments which involved<br>pre-treatments of rinsing in fresh water<br>or or not then this was because<br>um<br>uh because asparagus is a sloppy fleshy<br>uh silvery when you pull it up it's got<br>lots it retains a lot of the sea water<br>so when you dry this straight away<br>you'll end up having about 50<br>um Ash or in organic matter<br>uh so you're also when you're feeding<br>the feeding animals uh whole biomass<br>you're also feeding them lots lots of<br>minerals or even though there's quite a<br>low um<br>concentration of Silverwood innocent<br>um some of the things that we wanted to<br>try was to see if we could remove<br>um uh this um this inorganics um<br>and then we also tried a range of<br>different drying methods including<br>freeze drying as control<br>um vacuum drying uh which is kind of<br>like freeze drying but you don't<br>um<br>take it down so far<br>um and drying in a food dehydrator or in<br>an oven in lots of different<br>combinations that the sort of take-home<br>message here is that anything's on the<br>on the left hand side<br>um is methane production in this in<br>Virtual trials um again in the in the<br>little sanitation bottles<br>and on the right hand side of this graph<br>is the bromiform content of the biomass<br>that resulted from all these different<br>treatments and the dotted line shows<br>that one milligram per gram from form<br>per dry weight which is kind of a cut<br>offline really for where you see<br>um<br>uh sufficient reduction to really you<br>know take a note<br>um of my phone production and so<br>basically everything that kind of sticks<br>out beyond that line where the fridge<br>dried treatments<br>um apart from the top two<br>um<br>um the second and third from the top<br>which were dehydrated or killed drained<br>but still lost substantial amounts of of<br>bromoform compared to the um frizz<br>drying so nothing really works uh with a<br>fresh biomass apart from<br>um freeze drying when you're looking at<br>this different drying options one thing<br>that really sort of came out of here<br>once again that really strong dose<br>response so now that we've had so many<br>different concentrations of Roma form uh<br>we could plot the CH4 production against<br>bromoform concentration and found that<br>um at this dose we'll be using it two<br>percent organic matter inclusion in in<br>them in the food here<br>uh when I did at least one milligram per<br>gram<br>um one milligram of bromophone per gram<br>of biomass<br>um to get that really high<br>reduction in methane so it's just going<br>to really highlighted that quality<br>control and retention of bromoform is is<br>critical for the um for the efficacy<br>um<br>so then we moved on to working out some<br>better methods of um of preserving the<br>bromoform in the biomass and so here uh<br>it's an experiment where I put<br>um asparagus is fresh Aspergers straight<br>literally straight from the water into<br>oil from from the supermarkets so just<br>some cooking oil<br>um and use both intact or homogenized<br>biomass and then store this at four<br>degrees or at room temperature for up to<br>a year<br>and so damn<br>there's a bit of sort of analytical<br>variance through the year<br>um but basically storing it at four<br>degrees you can store this this aspect<br>of oil for up to a year without any<br>losses of bromoform and there's some<br>losses at 25 degrees but not a great<br>deal so there's other people who's<br>taking this a bit further<br>uh since looking at both storing free<br>stratospheric offices and aspergopsis in<br>oil and a range of different<br>temperatures and light conditions and<br>finding if you<br>so the freeze-dried biomass as long as<br>in the dark you can store it at up to I<br>so they're just minus 24 degrees in the<br>dark they all last but if you store the<br>aspergopsis oil<br>um as long as it's in the dark you can<br>actually store it at up to 40 degrees<br>and that's much more relevant for sort<br>of those on Farm<br>conditions where you can't really expect<br>your uh your cattle Farmers to have<br>a refrigerated storage for<br>um for the cattle food so this is a<br>really uh really good<br>um scalable solution<br>which we also have patented<br>so now that we know that all of these<br>things are working it's safe for the<br>animal we can actually<br>retain the bromoform in the biomass we<br>are now looking at farming at scale and<br>so here um Alyssa is in the audience<br>here uh our PhD student uh here at<br>waikato she's working on uh closing life<br>cycle and doing early life history work<br>for aquaculture of um of asphalog opsis<br>uh it's got a pretty complex life cycle<br>there's lots of different steps to work<br>out how to do to be able to see it on<br>demand<br>in the meantime we're working with<br>industry Partners in in Australia<br>seaforest have supplied a lot of The<br>Gorgeous underwater photos here<br>um and they're currently growing already<br>at scale using um vegetative methods<br>um this still a bit of press and<br>commentary in the midday about the<br>environmental safety of using<br>asphericopsis um<br>for Mayfair mitigation because bromoform<br>s uh Essa volatile that riches up in the<br>atmosphere and can have ozone depletion<br>effects<br>and so there's no doubt that ozone that<br>bromoform has this effect in the<br>atmosphere it's more about the scale and<br>the relevant the relative<br>um<br>effect of gramophone versus other other<br>compounds that have the same effect<br>so basically the the intensity and the<br>impact of<br>uh of romiform emissions will vary<br>depending on how you're growing and also<br>where you grow it so for example if you<br>were to grow<br>um so there's one of the life stages uh<br>the filamentous little pom-poms that you<br>can grow in land-based system in<br>free-floating aerated cultures<br>um and if you were to do this uh in the<br>tropics those systems would<br>um where it's hot and there'll be more<br>evaporation<br>um<br>those systems would emit a lot more<br>bromiform to the atmosphere than if you<br>are growing the gametophyte stage which<br>is that um<br>the larger facilities state that was on<br>the farm underwater Farm structures so<br>if you grow that stage in<br>um in temperature Waters there will be a<br>lot less<br>um<br>emissions because of the farming<br>intensity and also because of the<br>temperature<br>um and so<br>um these guys here Joe Dale they uh um<br>that group included a bunch of<br>atmospheric uh chemistry scientists and<br>they were estimating that<br>um<br>35 000 tons dry weight of aspheric<br>opposis would be needed to treat 50 of<br>the Australian<br>um beef and dairy herd and even if all<br>of this biomass was grown in Darwin in<br>land-based tanks<br>um the Roma form that would be admitted<br>to the atmosphere from this production<br>would be less than 0.2 percent of<br>um so this is also mouthful the global<br>ozone depletion potential weighted<br>emissions so this is um a formula that<br>is typically used for long-lived<br>um volatiles that has uh ozone depletion<br>capacity and so when we apply this to<br>baroma form which is<br>um short-lived it will overestimate the<br>impact that it has as well so um<br>which means that in the scale of things<br>um it really isn't that relevant of a<br>concern<br>which is great<br>so is it a done deal we've been working<br>on this for more than a decade<br>um<br>but there's still uh third scale food<br>trials going on and so this is happening<br>um like all over the world<br>um really at all scales as well because<br>um so there's large scale fit trials<br>happening in Australia and the US and<br>they're still probably more sort of<br>early stage<br>um trials going on in Europe<br>and is this because I mentioned earlier<br>as well that the different food systems<br>and production systems and whatever<br>basal food the animal<br>um is is eating will will interact with<br>the effects of um of the Aspergers as<br>well so there's still<br>um uh dosing and treatment and delivery<br>to work out at scale<br>uh and it's also the question of<br>Economics for uptake by the actual<br>um ruminant Farmers right because this<br>would be an additional fade ingredient<br>that they would need to buy or if they<br>buy a whole food<br>it would be you know an additional<br>ingredient that had to be added in<br>before they buy which is it's an<br>additional cost so so then it kind of<br>comes down to<br>um legislation<br>and also uh consumer pressure<br>and the actual just economics around<br>um large-scale uptake so the conclusion<br>after all of that is uh what's the<br>effects<br>um and that's uh that's the end thanks<br>thank you Marie I've just got we've got<br>a bit of an issue with double screens<br>and controls I'm going to zip over here<br>so I can see the zoom ones but in the<br>interim does anyone in this room have<br>any questions for Marie<br>like what's the what's the pathway of<br>the incorporation<br>simulation or is it like from a sea<br>water or is it like a production I<br>life cycle stages you could potentially<br>kind of like make fun of the<br>um<br>yeah this uh a production cellular<br>intracellular production pathway so they<br>pick up bromine<br>um from the water and make all sorts of<br>things with it asparagus is specifically<br>so stores a lot of those compounds in<br>the gland cells but a whole raft of<br>seaweed also produce<br>brominated compounds within within the<br>cells sorry I kind of miss the last part<br>oh I said because they're kind of<br>anything there<br>um yeah anything that takes up I think<br>that's the thing what you do so if<br>you're growing it on land and in this<br>aerated tanks you're kind of really<br>driving a bit of uh you know air results<br>and and evaporation of water and so you<br>despite disturbing them so much<br>that will lead to more emissions for us<br>if you're just growing the algae in<br>um<br>it in on Marin Farms<br>it's kind of much more like that natural<br>system<br>um<br>I don't know it's<br>good points<br>I don't think that there's anything else<br>that you can grow with them uh because<br>they they're really asphalogopsis is one<br>of the species they're really<br>um produces most so they'll you know<br>they'll be kind of taking up most<br>um<br>from in from the environment<br>um<br>um yeah<br>thanks Tim we've got a question from<br>Charlie<br>on Zoom yes thanks Marie this is a great<br>talk thank you very much I'm just<br>curious do you have any sense of<br>when this product will become Market<br>competitive with um with carbon you know<br>basically just buying credit off ETS<br>right just noting that the unit price is<br>ranging around 40 to Upward of 80 per<br>unit right now<br>um do you think that this is going to be<br>commercially attractive to the farmers<br>as you as you sort of highlighted within<br>the near future<br>yeah I think uh in in Australia for<br>example we're kind of hanging out for<br>legislation around uh<br>um carbon emissions specifically from<br>from farming so you know when when you<br>start to actually put limits on how much<br>someone can Emit and then there are you<br>know mitigations with that and then<br>having the mitigation strategies<br>available without having to cut<br>um The Herd size that's kind of when we<br>think it's probably going to happen in<br>Australia<br>um and so it'll be similar here so your<br>voice is coming from over there so it's<br>any idea but yes but so so hopefully<br>that will come through if we believe<br>that that will come through next year<br>um<br>and and so that's that there's a lot of<br>in people are there's a lot of farmers<br>who that we're working with who already<br>including it more for<br>um uh<br>advertising purposes so it's used in a<br>commercial sense already in Australia by<br>um brother GM bail the wool they make<br>suits<br>um so they make carbon neutral uh Woolen<br>suits by feeding their sheep asparagus<br>um and then there is a but it's a<br>hamburger<br>um chain who's got one carbon neutral<br>burger that they're feeding aspergopsis<br>but they're doing it more for the<br>promotion of it at the moment rather<br>than<br>um uh you know buying it up at scale to<br>roll out to all their Farms it's more of<br>a we've got this sort of<br>single line of of um Iron products<br>which is sought after by consumers so<br>there's you know they're still there the<br>consumer Drive is going to be quite<br>we got any other questions from anyone<br>there's one from Chris Tanner he put it<br>in text Rebecca can you read it uh uh do<br>you want to read it out Charlie sorry I<br>can't see that Chris is online<br>just come online yep okay I was just<br>wondering nice talk um Marie yeah really<br>good<br>um yeah how sustained is the inhibition<br>in the uh in the ruminant gut I mean is<br>there any sign that ruminants will I<br>know gradually evolve or become<br>accustomed to this or you know sort of<br>so that it'll wear off in some way or<br>there'll be selection for<br>method agents that can get around it<br>I think that's one of the answers that<br>will uh need the longer term so the<br>longest term in vitro trials so far is<br>like 90 days I think or maybe maybe that<br>um so you know there needs to be it's<br>not gonna matter for example for<br>um<br>uh food lot fed beef where Canada was<br>the the first cab of the rank really<br>because they don't live long enough<br>um<br>uh whereas you know it might be an issue<br>for for dairy uh but we'll just I think<br>we'll need to do some of those longer<br>term trials<br>um as well that go over you know a whole<br>animal uh<br>um cycle<br>but you can see already so from and<br>there's been quite a few more studies I<br>obviously only talked about our studies<br>um but there's been quite a few more<br>studies looking at the microbiome uh<br>changes in the microbiome specifically<br>uh and and you can see from from<br>Lorena's<br>um first study there that after<br>um you know seven or two hours after<br>Third Edition you know in a closed<br>bottle you start to get growth for the<br>methanogens again so it's something that<br>you know you have to keep feeding on uh<br>on a that you know on a continuous basis<br>so it's not like a one dose it's<br>something to you know keep keep fitting<br>so so there is there is potential I<br>guess it's the<br>um if I'm trying to answer it shortly<br>which I find hard<br>anyone else with any further questions<br>or anyone else in the room here with any<br>gone<br>oh<br>there we go sorry our screen just<br>disappeared moment here um anyone else<br>in here with any further questions for<br>Marie<br>um Maria I have one for you then what do<br>you see as being the biggest challenge<br>in the space to actually make farming of<br>asparagopsis commercial at a viable<br>scale<br>oh<br>because there's all the other things<br>that need to work for it to be able to<br>be implemented but we actually need to<br>be able to grow it<br>yeah what's the biggest challenge in<br>that space well the growing's already<br>happening so see Forest they're already<br>producing<br>um producing at scale<br>um and it's it's really about the uptake<br>to the farmers there's still a lot of<br>work to do in terms of<br>um the best delivery say if you wanted<br>to<br>um you know sell product to a farmer and<br>they will have that on their property<br>for the duration of a you know just<br>storage freely and that long-term<br>long-term storage and and looking at<br>delivery to different production systems<br>so it's quite different for<br>their feedlot stairs compared to the<br>um<br>free-ranging gracing animals and and<br>even if you're looking at them<br>um like I think I think you're only ever<br>going to look at<br>treating a portion of a herd like you<br>weren't actually a bit treating the the<br>free-wrenching beasties in in Australia<br>which you know kind of let go and and<br>then they're out in the bush that<br>arrange them out with helicopters before<br>you take them so if it's not so it's<br>always going to be you know particular<br>production systems and and those sort of<br>things but but I think that's probably<br>where the<br>um the the biggest hurdles are and then<br>and then it's going to be around the<br>uptake<br>we've got no more questions from anyone<br>else<br>we'll say thank you very much to Marie<br>for a really interesting seminar um I've<br>been sort of on the edges of the space<br>for the last decade so it's been really<br>nice to see it all packaged it's been a<br>really nice story of the progression but<br>thanks very much Beret we've all really<br>enjoyed it and um thank you everyone for<br>attending<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
