to<br>deliver the graduation dress<br>Tanga<br>Tennessee<br>I'd like to congratulate you all on<br>graduating today<br>I attended this University in the early<br>80s<br>this was a watershed time for me<br>I was the third generation of my family<br>to attend otago my children were the<br>fourth<br>and I've told my grandchildren they'll<br>in my role as president of the Law<br>Society I have the honor of addressing<br>the court when a new judge is being<br>sworn in<br>of course I must show complete<br>impartiality<br>but it is my habit when the new judge<br>wasn't otago graduate<br>to refer to the fact that the new judges<br>come from New Zealand's oldest and<br>there are a number of messages I want to<br>leave you with today the involved<br>community<br>adapting to change continuing to learn<br>storytelling and justice<br>so starting with Community is important<br>you've experienced the university<br>community over the last few years it's<br>important now to go out into the world<br>and to engage with your community the<br>wider society and your professional<br>community<br>your wider Community has provided you<br>with a fine education and is your it is<br>your responsibility to give back<br>learning learn what is going on in the<br>world<br>read the news every day local news<br>National News global news<br>be part of the world<br>I recommend joining Community groups<br>be part of sports clubs Boards of<br>schools churches and in your<br>in the 1960s I grew up in the rural<br>otago town of tapanui<br>conversation at Family Meal times<br>concern topics such as the Vietnam War<br>and the proposed raising of Lake<br>manipuri<br>my father was the local Presbyterian<br>minister<br>he met regularly with his Catholic and<br>Anglican counterparts and they agreed<br>that the town desperately needed clean<br>water modern sewage system and pension<br>housing<br>we've decided that one of them was going<br>to have to stand for the Borough Council<br>my father did that and successfully<br>conducted a campaign to build all of<br>these facilities so that's the example<br>of community involvement and Community<br>Action that I've grown up with<br>and in terms of being involved in our<br>communities we need to be prepared to<br>live and work in the many regions around<br>this country and not just the big cities<br>in various professions there are<br>enormous opportunities out there<br>wonderful professional advantages and<br>the chance to be actively involved in<br>your community and to achieve a<br>work-life balance indeed yesterday I was<br>at a meeting in Queenstown with legal<br>people from Southland and the otago<br>hinterland they are crying out for<br>graduates to come and work in their<br>now Justice is important<br>both an illegal and a social sense and<br>as we as we can see it many times the<br>price of justice is eternal vigilance<br>so never forget them<br>I was reminded of this once when I was<br>sitting listening to a speech given by<br>someone who had been a chaplain with the<br>British army serving in Kosovo<br>the speaker suddenly referred to me by<br>name in the middle of his speech he said<br>we should all be grateful for having<br>lawyers in our midst<br>he said serving in Kosovo was a powerful<br>lesson to him in the need for the rule<br>of law and for lawyers<br>he said that without law there is chaos<br>and there is barbarism<br>it's important to collect stories and to<br>tell stories<br>I was once told the story by a judge of<br>the importance of drama in the courtroom<br>the example he used was of a jury trial<br>he presided over in 1981<br>the defendant honey harrowera was<br>defending himself<br>against charges arising from protests at<br>the final Springbok match at Glee Eden<br>Park<br>the crown case had finished<br>he was then told by the judge that he<br>could call Witnesses in his defense<br>normally this would involve Witnesses<br>who had been there and could ever and<br>could give evidence of what they had<br>seen<br>instead haruera said the only witness he<br>could think of to call<br>was Bishop Desmond Tutu<br>tutu was of course a very famous World<br>figure and it seemed inconceivable that<br>he could be called to give evidence in a<br>district court in Auckland for an<br>incident outside Eden Park when he had<br>not been present there was only one<br>witness that could have been a better<br>one to call and that would have been<br>Nelson Mandela but he of course was in<br>the court crier called out the bishop's<br>name and the name echoed down through<br>the double doors at the back of the<br>courtroom then burst open and there<br>stood Bishop Desmond Tutu in his full<br>regalia<br>as I was told you could have heard a pin<br>drop the whole courtroom stood up to<br>acknowledge Him<br>he was called into the witness box and<br>Harrow weira asked him the simple<br>question<br>what is apartheid<br>his response was Apartheid is an<br>abomination in the eyes of man and in<br>the eyes of God<br>that was it<br>he left the witness box and everyone in<br>the courtroom stood up and bowed<br>Hara where I was acquitted<br>of course from the strict legal point of<br>president judge said no one in the world<br>would be prepared to convict a man who<br>had the nerve the gall the courage to<br>so and I I heard the story from a judge<br>many many years ago and I thought he<br>might have embellished it a bit<br>but later I came across people who were<br>actually in the courtroom this did<br>happen<br>so there are three messages that come<br>from that story one is drama<br>another is about human rights but most<br>importantly it's about Justice<br>near this bishop tutu said<br>if you are neutral in situations of<br>Injustice<br>you have chosen the side of the<br>oppressor<br>if an elephant has its foot on the tail<br>of a mouse and you say that you are<br>neutral<br>the mouse will not appreciate your<br>neutrality<br>I'd suggest that this is highly<br>irrelevant when considering current<br>so just because your time here at otago<br>is over do not think that you should<br>stop learning<br>keep an open mind keep inquiring and<br>most importantly be prepared to learn<br>from the mistakes you make<br>much has changed since I was a student<br>here<br>at that time I was taught that the<br>Treaty of waitangi was merely a matter<br>of quaint historical interest and it was<br>not part of the municipal law of New<br>Zealand<br>so much has changed<br>our courts have led this change<br>at the invitation of enterprising<br>Innovative lawyers who were prepared to<br>advocate for the positive development of<br>our common law<br>this is now a time in our legal<br>development when tikanga is being<br>recognized and embraced<br>the most striking example of this is the<br>recent Ellis case<br>when our Supreme Court used tikanga to<br>effectively plug a gap in our law<br>traditionally it did man's rights would<br>die with him<br>but when the court considered the<br>importance of the Dead Man's Manor it<br>concluded that the case must proceed<br>and what was revolutionary was that<br>Ellis was pakiha<br>this is nothing to be frightened of<br>it's a welcome and positive development<br>as we work towards having a Lex aotearoa<br>that will put us in a unique position in<br>this world<br>it is also honoring the true intentions<br>of those who drew up and signed the<br>treaty in 1840.<br>when I first began practicing law<br>there were no computers<br>indeed we didn't even have faxes<br>as a junior I had the job of doing some<br>work for an Australian Law Firm<br>they they were to send me a document and<br>ask over the phone for my fax number<br>I'd never heard the word before<br>but didn't let on so I didn't want the<br>Australians to think that I lived and<br>worked in a primitive Backwater<br>I got off the phone and asked the<br>practice manager what effects was and<br>whether we had one<br>inquiries were made and it turned out<br>that there was one fax machine in the<br>whole of Christchurch<br>based at the chief post office<br>ideally conveyed the number to the<br>Australians<br>nonchalantly as though we had lots and<br>lots of them<br>but it was later pointed out to me that<br>the printout at their end would show<br>that instead of from my Law Firm it had<br>come from the Christchurch Chief post<br>office<br>so since then of course we have adapted<br>to a truly electronic world<br>and the next challenge will be<br>artificial intelligence<br>so change will be a constant in your<br>professional lives<br>you have the privilege of being well<br>educated<br>we need to continue working towards<br>making the legal profession and other<br>professions truly reflective of our<br>societies<br>we need we need to work towards<br>diversity inclusion and equity<br>we all need to use our privileged status<br>to help bring this
