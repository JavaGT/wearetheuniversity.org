who<br>Professor Kerry Gibson and Shakira<br>Clinical Psychology student is that<br>right yes that is right Rodolfo so what<br>is Clinical Psychology Kerry<br>well<br>well basically it's a advanced<br>qualification so we do it at a doctoral<br>level here at University of Auckland and<br>it's where people learn to kind of work<br>with people who are experiencing mental<br>health problems of various kinds you do<br>a substantial piece of doctoral research<br>as part of it you have a lot of input<br>from clinical psychologists to teach you<br>the skills that you need to work in this<br>area and also you have some practice<br>outside in the community working in<br>services this is my first year of the<br>doctoral program and it's been a really<br>great transition from I suppose learning<br>all the theory behind psychological<br>practice and now actually getting to go<br>out in the community and be able to use<br>that theory a little bit so a lot of my<br>time is yeah we spent doing research so<br>that's a substantial portion of the<br>degree then we spend a lot of time in<br>class learning different therapy skills<br>and that is all with yeah of course<br>qualified clinical psychologists we're<br>really getting that Knowledge from<br>people who have been out in the<br>community the other part is spent on<br>placement in the community getting to<br>practice doing what we're here to do I<br>think many people that come in and want<br>to do Clinical Psychology might not<br>think research is something you have to<br>do but tell us a little bit first about<br>your research but also why research is<br>actually important in this profession<br>what I'm looking at is how body<br>satisfaction operates in Intimate<br>Relationships so I'm looking at a dietic<br>couples so how does my body satisfaction<br>affect my partner's relational<br>well-being and how does their<br>satisfaction influence my well-being in<br>a relationship research isn't is a<br>really important part of what we do we<br>can't just go out in the community and<br>talk about whatever we want to talk<br>about personally all has to be grounded<br>in theory and in scientific literature<br>really so what's that been like for you<br>you know you're in your second year now<br>it sounds like out of four years what's<br>it been like for you as far as you know<br>the challenge and the struggles doing a<br>doctoral sort of thesis while doing the<br>practicums and things you have to do<br>aropo a group of people that you're<br>go through the ups and downs with you<br>and who understand those struggles and<br>who are able to kind of mutually Bond<br>over that experience you go through this<br>Mutual struggle and you just have to<br>laugh about it because if you don't<br>laugh about it you cry about it so<br>um just having the support of everyone<br>and being able to share that difficulty<br>together is is the best part so Kerry<br>from like a faculty perspective like<br>you're an associate professor I'm sure<br>you've seen a lot of students go through<br>but what are the most rewarding bits for<br>you I just love the interaction with the<br>students I feel like students bring new<br>ideas and freshness and I I have often<br>thought I would you know if I ever had<br>to leave the the university I'd really<br>miss that kind of way students challenge<br>you it's also such a incredible<br>privilege in a way to to just hear<br>people's stories and I sort of agree<br>with you Shakira like the thing of being<br>a part of people's journey to make their<br>lives better and and that's such an<br>incredible sort of privilege we have a<br>psychologist so I imagine there's a lot<br>of students wanting to go into this<br>profession and I imagine there's some<br>that are already sort of being accepted<br>or whatever what's your advice you know<br>for them in terms of sort of getting<br>into programs<br>um I think that the best things you can<br>do are you know to do a bit of<br>volunteering to give yourself a bit of<br>experience of what it might be like to<br>be a mess of helping role with somebody<br>you know helping an organizations what's<br>your next sort of what's your next step<br>you know what are you wanting to do<br>after you get sort of that doctorate<br>working as a clinical psychologist out<br>in the community<br>um with those who are really in need of<br>our support at the moment it's with<br>young people<br>um sitting with them in their times of<br>distress<br>um so yeah hopefully in a few years from<br>now you'll see me out in the community<br>sounds like a plan maybe I'll even see<br>you<br>cool thank you so much for this<br>interview and thanks for inviting us<br>into your space looks like you're doing<br>a lot of good like I don't know her<br>research we're after another interview<br>so good luck with your research good<br>luck with your studies have a good day</p></main><footer
