takawingo my<br>name is Marcelo an associate professor<br>here at the faculty of law at the<br>University of otago I'm in the convener<br>of education and it's my great pleasure<br>to be with you here today let's keep<br>sort of quieting down really Keen for<br>this to start so we'll get underway<br>greetings to those of you here in this<br>this Mighty lecture theater Castle one<br>greetings uh to those of you who have<br>picked up Castle too uh next door I'm<br>sorry I can't be with you in person but<br>we are there beaming to you live I'm<br>joined today with some very special<br>guests to my right your left<br>uh is associate professor Edward Willis<br>um a relatively new hire here at the<br>University of otago but very<br>accomplished uh that he is he's going to<br>be talking to you later on<br>um about how law works at otago in the<br>first year and two very wonderful<br>students son of Vitalis and Lydia Joseph<br>both shining examples of of who you<br>could become if you decide to become a<br>student here at the University of otago<br>and you made the even better decision to<br>take on law it's really really great to<br>have you here with us I know that some<br>of you have traveled a long distance to<br>be here today and we've greeted you with<br>20 degree weather and at least six food<br>trucks<br>um and so we've really pulled out all<br>the stops but you're learning a lot<br>about lots of different subjects about<br>Health Sciences about economics about<br>any sort of program that is offered here<br>at the University of otago and we want<br>to spend some time to you to tell you<br>why we think the best decision is to<br>pick a lord free so<br>first we're going to talk about what law<br>is all about I got two aims today first<br>I want to sell you on the law and why<br>you should study it I don't really even<br>care where you do it you know I just<br>want you to study law because I think<br>it's great I've been doing it for a<br>while now and boy am I hooked on it I<br>think I can hook you on it as well we'll<br>see that in a second if you can you know<br>where the exits are but two<br>if you like the law<br>I'll sell you on why you should do it<br>here in autoportie Dunedin why the<br>University of otago is just the one of<br>the best places to study law I think<br>that'll become very clear as to why we<br>can offer something a little bit<br>different different than the new<br>Victoria different than your Auckland<br>they're all very very fine law schools<br>but something at the University of otago<br>is different something that offers you a<br>really unique experience within law<br>school we'll go through that as well so<br>two things law and then Laura otago<br>let's get it underway<br>and we can start by doing some work<br>because I don't know how these other<br>presentations have gone but presumably<br>are hopefully not in Health Sciences or<br>something like that they're not actually<br>asking you to operate on patients and<br>economics they're not asking you to do<br>what<br>if they do an economics but in law we<br>can actually in this room<br>do some legal work and ask you some<br>questions we're gonna get through it<br>it's gonna be fantastic<br>maybe again<br>you can vote with your feet if you don't<br>like it but I think that you're going to<br>like it<br>and this is why<br>because<br>at the University of otago and<br>in your legal studies generally<br>we talk about a lot of different things<br>because the law is with us everywhere<br>it is something that permeates every<br>single facet of society<br>everything that you've done today will<br>have some legal aspect to it<br>so the way that you got here today for<br>example maybe it was by bus maybe it was<br>by car maybe it was on foot There are<br>rules of the road There are rules of<br>pedestrians there are all sorts of<br>things that will govern how you got here<br>today that food truck that you uh had at<br>lunch time maybe got a dodgy Kebab or<br>something like that there are food<br>healthy standards that will sort of help<br>out with that sort of thing yeah and<br>there are every single aspect of your<br>life is going to be governed by law in<br>some particular way and given that you<br>are for the most part<br>um all wonderful uh healthy high school<br>students I thought a very good example<br>would be the way that law impacts your<br>rights and responsibilities within<br>School<br>and so this is a real life example<br>something that happened to poor old 16<br>year old Lucan Batterson now Lucan<br>dashing young man that he is here this<br>goes all the way back down to 2015.<br>he was enrolled in a school called Saint<br>John's which is a school in Hastings in<br>the North Island<br>now Lucan is not just your average uh<br>year 12 kid he is a remarkable young man<br>all excellences within uh his his<br>studies but in addition to that member<br>of the first 15<br>Rugby Club<br>uh more than that he's a lifeguard and<br>was given a medal for bravery for saving<br>two people's lives when they got caught<br>in the surf<br>he is a model student<br>and the high court of New Zealand in one<br>of their decisions recognized them as a<br>quote very nice young man imagine a<br>judge saying that about you I can't<br>imagine it either but nevertheless this<br>guy is a good dude<br>with one problem<br>a new principle<br>and their principle comes to the school<br>he is ready to make his Mark as<br>principals tend to do I'm sure that<br>there might be one or two in the<br>audience no disrespect or disrespect<br>depending upon your views on that he<br>comes along and says I want to make a<br>Mark and I think the standards at St<br>John's has slipped he goes along to a<br>rugby game sees Luke and playing and he<br>notices one thing about Luke and that he<br>does not like he does not like it all<br>and you might be able to tell what he<br>doesn't like here<br>that sweet man bun he does not like the<br>length of lucan's hair says it's too<br>long<br>and this isn't just his impression he<br>says that this is a breach of the school<br>uniform policy which says that hair has<br>to be short tidy of natural color and<br>here must be off the collar and out of<br>his eyes extremes including plaits<br>dreads and Mohawks because they belong<br>in the same sentence are not acceptable<br>he says you've broken the rules you have<br>to cut your hair<br>and so the principal says to Lucan cut<br>your hair and his teachers say cut your<br>hair and what does Luke and say<br>no I'm not going to because I'm year 12<br>in this school and not a single person<br>has asked me to cut my hair until this<br>point and it's always been this length<br>I keep it off<br>the collar here<br>look at me in a suit I look great<br>this is not a breach of the rules you<br>just don't like long hair but I'm<br>keeping it tidy I don't think it's a<br>breach of the rules I don't think I<br>should have to cut it<br>and so what happens well the principal<br>says cut your hair and as teachers say<br>cut your hair to the point where a<br>teacher true story<br>get so annoyed she burst into tears over<br>this please cut your hair she says and<br>he remains Resolute and says no now in a<br>situation like that<br>you can say he's courageous but usually<br>in situations like that ah the student<br>doesn't tend to sort of win doesn't tend<br>to get much out of that and eventually<br>they have to comply<br>well Lucan wasn't taking<br>these sorts of directions a face value<br>he gets more and more annoyed and so<br>does the principle and eventually<br>the principal and the Board of Trustees<br>at the school say that this is starting<br>to get really serious and so they<br>consider<br>suspending him<br>and so this little exit up here is<br>section 14 at the Education Act 1989<br>which was the legal power<br>that the principle was given by<br>Parliament<br>to suspend or stand down students when<br>they break the rules<br>and so the principle says I think that<br>you have broken the rules enough I think<br>the fact that you consistently say no to<br>us is a problem and therefore I am<br>deciding<br>to suspend you<br>and he does<br>and Lucan gets kicked out of some John's<br>and now at that point surely you'd say<br>oh just go to a different School dude<br>but he likes and John's his friends were<br>there he'd spent all of his high school<br>education there and he knew or at least<br>he wanted to believe<br>that he was right that he hadn't<br>actually broken the rules<br>and so Luke and Madison who is exactly<br>the same age as you<br>along with his mum decide to essentially<br>sue the school<br>and the way that they can do this this<br>is the area of law that I practice in<br>so does uh associate professor Willis as<br>well actually this idea about limiting<br>Public Power<br>we have all sorts of public institutions<br>in this country some very big some very<br>small<br>but the idea is is that they operate and<br>exercise their power conditionally they<br>can't go beyond the scope of their power<br>if they do they're acting really Beyond<br>those limits and they're acting without<br>legal Authority<br>and because of that<br>the courts can sometimes step in and<br>ensure that they're actually staying<br>within the limits of their power and<br>that's what Lucan was saying here he<br>said that the principal went beyond his<br>legal Authority because he was principal<br>of a public school he wasn't able to do<br>that<br>so what do you think<br>should Lucan be able to keep his hair<br>that long<br>more particularly did the principal have<br>to sustain Lucan<br>this is the point where I ask for some<br>willing volunteers to give me their<br>views as to whether or not this is the<br>case you could put your hand up and be a<br>hero now or else I'm going to start<br>picking people oh we have our first hero<br>right at the Back Sir what do you think<br>no the principal didn't have the power<br>right it's short and it's tiny so this<br>is the idea I'm just going to fill in<br>the blanks to you sir that he actually<br>was complying with the actual rule he<br>hadn't done anything wrong<br>so that's the sort of specifics of well<br>look I'm actually following the the<br>rules and therefore what about this sort<br>of power you can see sort of section 14<br>here the principal can stand down or<br>suspend a student if the parental is<br>satisfied on reasonable grounds<br>what about that that legal power to do<br>this is the law student mentality folks<br>this is fantastic well done madam this<br>is what we call statutory interpretation<br>and statutes might seem boring and fussy<br>and old and that sort of stuff but they<br>can relate to man buns folks they can be<br>interesting they can be relevant just<br>like this<br>very nice analysis is this<br>example that's growing your hair long<br>a harmful or dangerous example to other<br>students at the school<br>that starts to sound a bit dodgy now<br>the principle comes back what could the<br>principal say in response to that it's<br>not so much the length of the hair that<br>was setting a problematic example<br>what was what was the the behavior of<br>Lucan after he was cut his uh asked to<br>ask to cut his hair what was the problem<br>with that<br>disobedience is always like someone like<br>Boomer age who sort of Leo said at this<br>point notice respects to it Disobedience<br>should have Bloody well comply with a<br>bloody principle can't believe it cut<br>your damn hair absolutely I'm not<br>projecting anything until you're just a<br>use of foil at this point but yeah<br>Disobedience maybe that's the harmful or<br>dangerous example<br>but is there a response to that<br>certainly yep madam<br>it's totally subjective so maybe he was<br>right if we put these two arguments<br>foreign<br>but nevertheless you're right it is a<br>subjective term hey so these arguments<br>in the central here he wasn't actually<br>in breach of the rule combined with this<br>idea that he wasn't actually setting a<br>harmful example and maybe Disobedience<br>when you might be in the right isn't<br>really much of a harmful or dangerous<br>example here maybe the idea of actually<br>resisting power in that regard and<br>actually sort of standing up for your<br>rights is actually lesser harmful and<br>dangerous example and actually a pretty<br>exemplary one<br>school is tough you are confined with<br>lots and lots of rules that put you in a<br>particular uniform and make sure that<br>you're in a particular place from 9 to 3<br>30 PM every day<br>that there is a legal requirement that<br>you're at school that's remarkable but<br>that doesn't mean that you don't have<br>rights and Lucan here<br>had a right to be treated appropriately<br>and the principal had to be satisfied on<br>reasonable grounds that his act of<br>growing his hair and then saying that<br>that was within the rules constituted a<br>harmful or dangerous example otherwise<br>he wasn't allowed to suspend him<br>he wins Lucan<br>he wins in the high court and the high<br>court says you were well outside of your<br>Authority here principal you had no<br>capacity to suspend Lucan because he<br>refused to cut his hair<br>he does something else though<br>he says that this rule is problematic<br>now this Builds on your point Madam<br>about why<br>being subjective why is that a problem<br>why is the subjectivity a problem when<br>we talk about rules like this when we're<br>lack of certainty I like that bang on<br>Madam absolutely if we don't know what<br>rules are and what they can mean in any<br>particular circumstance people can<br>continually say that my hair is too long<br>for example it changes on circumstances<br>it's completely subjective it's<br>uncertain that means it can't be applied<br>consistently and so the judge not only<br>says that the suspension of Lucan was<br>illegal he says that this rule is<br>illegal too<br>and Strikes down the rule<br>which goes to show two things one<br>that we constrain Public Power according<br>to law in New Zealand and two<br>students like you have the power to<br>challenge those decisions and that's<br>what law is all about<br>as I said law permeates every aspect of<br>society<br>and a law degree helps you understand<br>why that's the case and help others to<br>understand why that's the case<br>so throughout your four or five degrees<br>at Law School you will learn consistent<br>skill based knowledge<br>as to exactly how to interpret law to<br>really get excited about statutes to get<br>really excited about cases but more<br>importantly understand how they impact<br>real people in real world situations and<br>after you graduate that allows you to<br>actually help people help people like<br>Lucan who had and needed a lawyer<br>so<br>we want to get into some specifics here<br>about exactly how this all works so I'm<br>now going to<br>take you over to associate professor<br>Willis who is one of our excellent<br>teachers of laws 101 and he's going to<br>talk to you about exactly how that first<br>year program works<br>I killed a Koto oh yep you can hear me<br>that's fantastic<br>um as Marcelo sort of mentioned um when<br>he was introducing us all I'm a<br>relatively new hire here at otago<br>University<br>the university really knew what they<br>wanted when they were picking me so they<br>essentially ran Marcelo through the<br>photocopy at 125 and on what came out so<br>we have a system here and it works for<br>us I'm here because I'm in charge of uh<br>the first year law paper<br>um<br>in fact I'm teaching it at three o'clock<br>straight after this lecture so if you<br>like if you can find your way over to<br>Saint David usually only half my class<br>turns up there were heaps of seats pop<br>in for a while see what it's like<br>um be great to have you there<br>I we've revamped the paper which is part<br>of the reason I really want to talk to<br>you because we're trying to make it<br>relevant for modern people in a modern<br>society first thing we thought is<br>we need to give it a really exciting<br>name it's got to capture the imagination<br>so we call it laws 101 and we thought<br>that really captured the essence of what<br>we're trying to achieve<br>um we do a bunch of things in that<br>course we do the sorts of things Marcelo<br>has been talking about statutory<br>interpretation we look at the way legal<br>power is formulated through a very<br>exciting medium words<br>and we study those words in detail and<br>to be perfectly Frank sometimes it's a<br>little bit boring law touches every<br>facet of society uh learning about these<br>things in the abstract can be boring<br>seeing them in practice can be really<br>exciting and that's where you really<br>make a difference the other things we do<br>is we look at case law again doesn't<br>sound very exciting on its face but we<br>look at the way courts have made legal<br>rules over time and have channeled legal<br>power in a very different way<br>um we look specifically at Criminal Law<br>Public Law which is the sort of law<br>we've just been talking about and the<br>law of obligations things like contracts<br>and torts so you get a real feel for<br>what law actually does in various areas<br>um and there's two things that I really<br>want to mention actually three<br>I'll start with the third one first<br>um<br>I have to mark all your papers so if you<br>actually don't feel like doing law it's<br>fine lower numbers is good for me so<br>that's great<br>um maybe go to Wellington that's cool I<br>understand it's a perfectly good Law<br>School number two we have some really<br>amazing lecturers in North 101 I mean<br>I'm there too but you also have people<br>who are the best in New Zealand and<br>sometimes even the best in the world at<br>what they do you are exposed to<br>Brilliance from day one<br>um hopefully some of that will reflect<br>off you and number three we've really<br>focused in on this law and practice idea<br>so in addition to standing in front of<br>you and lecturing at you like this which<br>is not the most exciting way we can<br>communicate these things and we have<br>tutorials where you sit down with senior<br>students and they help you work through<br>actual problems and we have a program<br>which is unique here at otago which is<br>what we call workshops where you take a<br>break from sitting in lecture theaters<br>and you sit down with actual academics<br>and you work through how to structure<br>legal arguments and understand the power<br>dynamics involved understand the social<br>implications and understand what it<br>means to be a human being caught up in<br>this system of Statute and case law and<br>tikanga and all the things that make our<br>system function the way it does<br>um I'll leave it there<br>um<br>yeah thank you<br>thank you so much<br>um<br>yeah that's fantastic it is an excellent<br>all right<br>don't act like you're not used to it<br>dude gets a lot of claps because he<br>deserves them this is a dynamic and<br>interesting year but here's the secret<br>even if you're not sure about whether or<br>not you want to become a lawyer even if<br>you're not sure if you really want to do<br>a law degree<br>101 is a zero risk proposition<br>everyone should take laws 101 because<br>you understand what the legal system<br>looks like where we get law in New<br>Zealand how it works and you get to have<br>associate professor Willis as a lecturer<br>but if you don't want to continue with<br>law after that<br>you don't have to the whole point of 101<br>is that it is basically one paper one<br>full year paper that you take throughout<br>but then you take other non-law papers<br>alongside it you want to continue with<br>arts and drop law completely go for it<br>you want to focus on science instead<br>didn't really sort of get taken by law<br>that's fine there is no risk and it adds<br>points as you will soon realize points<br>are very important points your overall<br>degree<br>but what it will give you even if you<br>don't continue with a law degree is an<br>understanding of exactly how our legal<br>system works and some exposure to some<br>really interesting ideas it is a very<br>good proposition for every student to<br>take and very much unlike something like<br>Health Sciences for example not to beg<br>them at all but you have to take six or<br>seven papers as part of that first year<br>Health Science degree you don't get much<br>Choice one paper is all we're asking in<br>law and that is an amazing paper for<br>everybody to take and we couldn't<br>recommend it enough but if you love law<br>and you will uh<br>Dan I want to talk to you about what<br>happens next because we're actually on<br>the cusp of something special here at<br>otago at the moment and we've got one of<br>our uh not so new actually but extremely<br>prestigious uh senior lecturers here<br>Matilda today who you might remember<br>from her past life as being a incredibly<br>important Manawa in here<br>um within New Zealand<br>and she along with her colleagues have<br>created a very special program that<br>begins in second year now we can go into<br>exactly what you require and how it<br>works to get from first year to second<br>year that's the big leap it's open entry<br>and 101 we'll take everybody anybody we<br>love that diversity but we have to<br>shrink the class down in second year and<br>that ends up being sort of about one and<br>two students sort of get through<br>according to the marks of they want to<br>sort of continue but if you<br>got into second here<br>according to your mark on 101 and a<br>bunch of other sort of criteria then<br>we've got something special because<br>second year has always been a bit<br>interesting in New Zealand and this is<br>our first point of difference I think<br>from other law schools throughout the<br>country where it's an immersion year you<br>don't take any other courses you don't<br>take any other papers from your other<br>subjects we basically Mainline some<br>foundational legal subjects to you for<br>the full year and just like learning a<br>language it's really important if you<br>want to speak French to maybe spend a<br>year in in France and we know that if<br>you want to speak uh really fluent today<br>or then was probably the place for you<br>at the first instance immersion really<br>works and we think that that works for<br>the law as well<br>and so we focus on Lauren's second year<br>but just this year we have started doing<br>something a little bit different and I<br>wonder Matilda if you would be able to<br>to talk to us about exactly what's going<br>nice to see you all<br>um so I am a senior lecturer here and I<br>teach into the jurisprudence paper in<br>year three and I teach Maori law and<br>philosophy<br>um in their paper<br>so I will see I'm sure lots of you in<br>that paper in time to come<br>but there are stages that you need to go<br>through before you get to um to my paper<br>and the second year wananga tomato<br>is a really critical step in that<br>Journey from 2025 every law student in<br>the country in every law school will be<br>required to learn mataranga Maori Mata<br>Puna today so Maori laws and<br>philosophies and that means that every<br>stage of the law degree we will be<br>introducing you to that material at laws<br>101 with Ed and with uh Professor<br>Jacinto Dudu you saw who's standing next<br>to John Key<br>she has won teachers awards she's a<br>distinguished research fellow she she<br>teaches in two laws 101 and a lot of the<br>material that comes from<br>that's who there she's amazing so here<br>and I and Mahia to put a knee uh form<br>corpu corpu is the Maori research<br>collaboration that we have here legal<br>research collaboration that does a lot<br>of this work right into good okay<br>so the second year one the one I know<br>that we started this year is seven full<br>immersion days and the first seven days<br>of year two where we take you on a deep<br>dive into Maori law Maori philosophy<br>tikanga Maori we take you to otako Mirai<br>which is what you can see here where we<br>do work on Maori legal decisions so<br>decisions that come out of the Maori<br>land Court out of the Supreme Court out<br>of the high court on how tikanga Maori<br>or waitangi and the principles all<br>contribute to the way that New Zealand<br>law is developing because we're in this<br>exciting phase at the moment<br>exciting phase in the law where the law<br>is starting to really understand what<br>tikanga Maori as a set of legal<br>principles can contribute to the<br>development of our law and so when we<br>are working with you over the next few<br>years<br>you will be right at that castle of the<br>development of a new area of law in<br>aotearoa really will be new and so it's<br>really really exciting time to be doing<br>this and we're really pleased that at<br>second year wananga we can actually take<br>you out away from the lecture theaters<br>and take you out to understand what<br>Maori law is like in place what does<br>Maori look like at otako working with<br>manafinua what does Maori law like if we<br>go to atitudu which is the Mirai here in<br>the city in Dunedin what is law how is<br>it different if you're not in a<br>monofenua Mirai but you're somewhere<br>else and all of these things are the<br>works where you do with you during that<br>wananga we bring a whole lot of other<br>lecturers with us so it's not just me<br>and jacinta and michiata who work with<br>you but other lecturers from<br>um from The Faculty we have to fight<br>putake the Maori law Students<br>Association they come out too and do a<br>lot of work so we're engaged with Mahi<br>where I'm engage with wyatta with<br>karakia with Maori law with tikanga<br>Maori with porphity<br>all of these processes so you get this<br>deep dive into understanding Maori and<br>Maori law and second year and then third<br>year you come to me for Juris and we go<br>through another Deep dive into it this<br>is the new way that law will be taught<br>in aotearoa from 2025 and we're very<br>excited at otago that we've done we're<br>starting with the second year like this<br>it's Unique no other universities do<br>this and we're very very proud of the<br>work that we've done and of our students<br>our Toyota who've really engaged with<br>this new way of thinking and learning<br>so as Materia indicated this is a<br>requirement of all all schools but it's<br>a Target that's seizing the bull by the<br>horns and really sort of engaging with<br>this and it's really really exciting I<br>had the privilege of going along to<br>otako Mirai to really see how the<br>wananga was operating and seeing the<br>students there<br>they loved it I've never seen a more<br>cohesive and inspired second year it's<br>really exciting times here at Target and<br>otago law specifically<br>and that's all about the aqua to to<br>learn to teach to study to advise we<br>want to put this throughout our whole<br>curriculum throughout law school now as<br>material indicated once you get Beyond<br>second year you're allowed to diversify<br>again and boy do we have a lot of<br>specializations that we can offer you<br>here at otago law a really rich degree<br>an array of some of the most<br>amazing experts in their legal fields we<br>have folk that can dedicate themselves<br>to law on a democratic process if you<br>listen to morning report and they know<br>high school students that you're a big<br>rnz listeners and you will hear Andrew<br>get us uh most mornings talking about<br>which MP has jumped uh from their<br>particular party today and the legal<br>implications of that we have some of the<br>most foremost experts in the Treaty of<br>waitangi we have remarkable<br>international law Scholars we have the<br>foremost expert in New Zealand on on tax<br>law we have basically an array of<br>experts that are at the top of their<br>fields teaching you their Specialists uh<br>specializations and and helping you<br>decide what kind of lawyer you'd like to<br>become<br>but it's not just law and it goes back<br>to a sort of a point that I was making<br>earlier that it doesn't just have to be<br>a a complete sort of diet of law in your<br>first year you get to take other<br>subjects as well and that you have to<br>take other subjects whether or not they<br>are from Commerce art science or what<br>have you and this is reflected in what<br>we see at our law school there's only<br>nine percent that are doing a straight<br>degree most people are combining degrees<br>with other degrees so for example I did<br>an arts degree here at otago many years<br>ago of philosophy politics and economics<br>friends of mine did Commerce degrees we<br>have some terrific scientists that are<br>combining their legal studies with<br>scientific studies as well it's an<br>amazing complement to your legal studies<br>it allows you to be as diverse as<br>possible allow yourself allowing<br>yourself to apply your skills from one<br>degree to another<br>but I want to really sort of focus now I<br>think on exactly why otago is different<br>because for the most part what I've<br>talked about is why you should do law<br>it is an amazing way of seeing the world<br>honing your skills research analytical<br>communication becoming a valued member<br>of your Civic Community an incredible<br>degree to take but you can do that<br>effect and you can do that at Auckland<br>so why would you do it at otago one word<br>community<br>because you know you've been wandering<br>around the campus today good luck<br>wandering around the campus in the same<br>way at Victoria or Auckland fine<br>universities top of their game<br>remarkable Scholars but the community<br>that we built here that otago is famous<br>for is reflected within our law school<br>as well and that's what really sets us<br>apart<br>when we talk about student groups we<br>just don't talk about a couple of people<br>who are sort of engaging in sort of sort<br>of Fringe activities they are a core<br>part of the way that we see our Law<br>School<br>our main and longest running uh<br>organization has souls a society for<br>otago University law students which puts<br>on not just a bunch of incredibly good<br>sort of social events but also all sorts<br>of legal education clinics assisting you<br>throughout your degree and then we have<br>specialist groups who are doing an<br>amazing job at not only representing<br>their particular demographic but also<br>advancing the goals of that demographic<br>within law school no better than<br>who celebrated their 30th Anniversary or<br>just a couple of weeks ago who have been<br>doing the sort of money that Materia has<br>been referring to and are an integral<br>part of kaupapa here at<br>otago<br>new organizations the Pacific island<br>lawsuits Association or Target Asian<br>student law association and pride in<br>Laura otago have made their Mark and our<br>fundamental parts of our law school<br>community<br>and they are an indication of just the<br>the level of camaraderie companionship<br>togetherness that you'll find here at<br>an important part as well of what we see<br>here at<br>otago is this idea of uttu which<br>sometimes has a pejorative connotation<br>but actually means this idea of<br>repayment reciprocity<br>giving back<br>and that's why we also make a really<br>important emphasis on acting within the<br>community so I referred to souls earlier<br>they have a tenancy program that helps<br>non-law students work out their way<br>through flashing issues bad landlords<br>and so forth helping them out with free<br>legal advice<br>we have the public interest law Network<br>which is all about trying to make things<br>better within the community acting for<br>not-for-profits and acting for people in<br>the community and helping them out<br>ignite which is an also a more of a<br>business business advisory Service uh<br>for not-for-profits and law for change<br>looking at various sort of social issues<br>within<br>um New Zealand and acting on on that by<br>writing to Parliament uh and and getting<br>involved as well as sort of important<br>organizations such as the Community Law<br>Center<br>we are out there in the community really<br>giving back<br>Law Center as well police observation<br>schemes we ride along in a police car<br>just to see exactly how the law looks<br>like at the front end and the prison<br>visits at the back end as well<br>really sort of getting involved within<br>our community making you see exactly<br>what law looks like on the ground<br>in competitions it's not all hard work<br>is also some fun in it as well a Target<br>was some of it's full of some of the<br>most highly performing law students<br>throughout the world and I say that with<br>hand on heart knowing that because I've<br>got one right here Lydia Joseph was part<br>of this is her right here she's grinning<br>because she was just made 17th best team<br>in the world in a mock trial and mooting<br>competition in Washington DC just three<br>weeks ago<br>she beat the likes of Harvard she beat<br>the likes of many other Ivy League<br>schools within the states<br>otago is performing at extremely high<br>levels throughout the world uh and Sean<br>Ford and I wonder if we can get you to<br>say a couple of words about your<br>experience Lydia<br>by the way any Columbus<br>woman in the in the house Columbia roll<br>girl you could be like her fantastic<br>Lydia take it away<br>um yeah so<br>I don't know if anyone knows what<br>mooting is it's where you kind of dress<br>up and pretend to be a lawyer in a fake<br>court<br>so yeah I didn't come to University<br>thinking I'd be a motor but that's<br>exactly what I am and um yeah we didn't<br>realize when we won the otago University<br>mootin competition that that meant we<br>could end up in Washington DC but Joseph<br>the guy in the middle he was my teammate<br>and we went up to Auckland and we did<br>the national competition where we met<br>all the other law schools and then we<br>spent kind of six months preparing for<br>this<br>really intense competition in Washington<br>DC so it was um attended by 700 law<br>schools and it was<br>only based on international law because<br>that's the only law that every Law<br>School in the world teaches kind of in<br>the same way so we had this fake<br>scenario where there was three countries<br>at<br>um war with each other and so yeah we<br>spent our summers learning about<br>international law and then got to go to<br>Washington DC and argue about it so yeah<br>if you're if that sounds vaguely<br>interesting to anyone then come to otago<br>there's a compulsory moot that everyone<br>that does a degree at otago does in<br>their third year I think and then we<br>have a junior and a senior motion<br>competition so yeah there's a lot of<br>different opportunities to give things a<br>go<br>and the thing is<br>law firms tend to like these sort of<br>people these clever committed engaged<br>and enthusiastic charismatic young<br>people they tend to like them that's why<br>lady has been snapped up by New<br>Zealand's Premier Law Firm along with<br>Joseph actually going to the same firm<br>chapmanship in Wellington a remarkable<br>uh success for Lydia but success that is<br>available to all of you here why because<br>of the community that you find here at<br>otago a remarkable set of opportunities<br>if you don't like to eat them and bugger<br>off go on Exchange<br>this is something that has been on<br>Hiatus for the last couple of years for<br>obvious reasons and it's been a sad<br>thing because it ends up being a really<br>important part of many law school<br>students uh careers a semester abroad in<br>a completely different legal system<br>still learning the law but experiencing<br>another culture and broadening your<br>horizons as a result we have a lot of<br>sister universities throughout the world<br>that really offer an enriched and<br>enhanced experience that you don't have<br>to sort of sub in and it's not<br>particularly sort of onerous to do it in<br>fact it slots in right within your legal<br>studies here<br>don't want to pay their fees well you<br>don't have to you pay otago fees while<br>you're around and there are scholarships<br>to help you get there it's an amazing<br>opportunity in our exchange office is<br>running a higher opt-in campaign to do<br>that<br>well where does Lord otago take you<br>before we answer this question I want to<br>turn to our other very important student<br>here as well son of a Talis who is<br>currently working on an honors<br>dissertation at the moment with<br>associate professor Willis looking Deep<br>dive into the to the public service<br>within New Zealand her son is incredibly<br>uh accomplished student and I'd love to<br>hear her journey so<br>if you could just tell us a little bit<br>about where you came from what are you<br>doing what you want to go do next<br>hello everyone I'm Sana and I was<br>originally from Wellington and I came<br>down to study in otago what made me<br>shoes at Target was mainly The Vibes of<br>the place you know like how many<br>universities can you come down and be<br>like a five minute walk away from your<br>house to on being on campus and I think<br>what made me stay was<br>um the people and that is also obviously<br>the amazing faculty we have and in the<br>sense that you can form personal<br>relationships with the faculty members<br>and also the incredible other students<br>that you have to work with you so I mean<br>everybody has a great example of that<br>and<br>um<br>in terms of where Lord otago can take<br>you there are so many different<br>Community<br>programs that you can be a part of I've<br>been lucky enough to be a part of quite<br>a few of the ones that Masala has<br>already mentioned<br>and I can just honestly take you places<br>that you didn't even think of when you<br>started like I didn't know that I'd be<br>interested in public law and here I am<br>writing a dissertation on it with Ed<br>Willis so yeah some really cool stuff<br>available for you when you come to otago<br>law school what are you planning to do<br>next year<br>um next time I'm actually taking a gap<br>year and then I'll be working at Battle<br>Finlay in Wellington another excellent<br>Law Firm within New Zealand uh thank you<br>so much this is these are real people<br>peace<br>this is you in five years folks this is<br>this is not the distant future you you<br>look at me and you see old man time and<br>fair enough but these folks are doing<br>what you will be doing in five years and<br>that's why we get them along just to<br>hear a little bit more about their<br>experience someone what's your unicorn<br>whereabouts did you go Lydia did you did<br>you go I don't know we have remarkable<br>Halls within uh otago if you don't know<br>about them already then you know that<br>they are an integral part of the whole<br>first year experience and that's where<br>that Community starts<br>so where could law take you<br>well ARA is uh the pathway the passage<br>the track to success or at least a route<br>from law school to The Wider community<br>and we have plenty of examples here of<br>uh courageous Toyota who have gone on to<br>do amazing things Andrew Rowe right here<br>went from otago to the Supreme Court as<br>a clerk then to Harvard and now it works<br>for the Innocence Project fighting for<br>people who have had miscarriages of<br>Justice in the US we have<br>all of these Scholars within<br>um otago that can actually show you the<br>the pathway to reform and changing<br>Society for the better and Matilda<br>already referred to a horangi professor<br>jacinta ludu who is a first year<br>lecturer so you get to expose to this<br>greatness from the get-go by greatness I<br>mean literally the best lecturer in the<br>country winner of the prime minister's<br>Supreme teaching award a couple of years<br>back who amazing research within the by<br>Journal uh education that's going on<br>right this minute is some of the most<br>important that we've seen in the country<br>Bridget toy Cronin huh another 101<br>lecturer who is engaged in some<br>remarkable work in terms of access to<br>Justice Nicola Piet who is just on the<br>brink of retiring actually from otago<br>but has done remarkable work
