some<br>long lost friends<br>um and some new faces too so it's great<br>and we really appreciative of you taking<br>your time out of your busy schedules to<br>be here with us this evening it's<br>certainly proving to be a very popular<br>topic so we're very grateful for Eva Noy<br>for making the trip all the way from<br>Wellington to be with us here in<br>Auckland this evening my name is Rachel<br>manilaquiza I'm the senior business<br>development manager here at the Auckland<br>premises for Victorian University I form<br>part of the future students team for<br>and so a lot of our work is with<br>prospective students at the University<br>spreading the good work and telling the<br>aucklanders all to move down to<br>Wellington<br>mostly what we do<br>um Helen Doherty you would have met as<br>you came in this evening as well sees<br>our senior engagement and alumni advisor<br>and she has been laterally largely<br>responsible for organizing this event<br>for us and so we'll thank her<br>appropriately when she comes into the<br>room a little bit later on<br>and now just to let you know that we are<br>recording the session this evening the<br>camera is behind you so you don't need<br>to worry about putting your best selfie<br>face on<br>um even will be at the front here being<br>recorded if anybody sees anything I'm<br>towards which is probably most likely to<br>be me<br>um we'll just edit that bit out so don't<br>worry<br>um so that we can share this recording<br>because we've had a number of people who<br>would have liked to have been here this<br>evening but can't make it so we'd like<br>to share that recording of the<br>presentation within this evening<br>tonight is all about connecting with you<br>as alumni I've already heard some great<br>stories that I've never heard before<br>thank you sue well done<br>um but it's also about sharing some of<br>the research and the work that's been<br>happening at Victoria University<br>Wellington<br>um and we are really pleased that<br>Professor Illinois has joined us this<br>evening from Wellington to share some of<br>the work that he's currently doing<br>internet is a professor in economics and<br>holds the chair in the economics of<br>disasters and climate change<br>he and his team are based within the<br>Wellington School of Business and<br>government and based at our campus<br>Elon and his research group study<br>disasters including earthquakes<br>epidemics droughts Cyclones and I<br>um as we see these events becoming more<br>intense their economic impacts become<br>more Superior and more damaging as well<br>and I do just want to take a moment to<br>acknowledge that some of us in the room<br>have been impacted by some of the recent<br>floods here in Auckland<br>um you can you know you can talk and<br>have your personal stories about the<br>cost of climate change<br>um I know that can be a very stressful<br>thing so our thoughts are with it with<br>you tonight Elin will discuss the cost<br>of climate change how greenhouse gas<br>emissions impact on those costs and what<br>this might mean for insurance in the<br>future<br>thank you Elin for being with us tonight<br>and giving us a little insight into the<br>very important and very relevant work<br>that you and your team are doing<br>thank you very much<br>yes so<br>um The Talk today is about<br>um James<br>work<br>um when we think of the cost of climate<br>change we frequently talk about two<br>things we talk about the cinnamon rice<br>and we talk about the increase in the<br>average temperature and a lot of the<br>media discussions for example about<br>climate changes whether our world is<br>eating by 1.5 degrees 2 degrees<br>2.5 degrees or maybe even will end up<br>with the world of three or four degrees<br>to come from you know I think that to<br>some extent is a<br>that discussion is a problem because<br>what we're doing is we're trying to look<br>for the impact of climate change<br>um where it's easiest to visualize Maybe<br>pretty easy to visualize you know my<br>pattern underwater<br>um<br>but<br>the real cost of climate change is<br>somewhere else right so what we're doing<br>is they're a lot of times we're thinking<br>we're looking for the keys under the<br>string lights rather than where they<br>truly are<br>and the cost of climate change is in the<br>extreme weather events that's what I'm<br>going to try and argue<br>today and when I'm talking about extreme<br>weather events I'm talking about<br>droughts I'm talking about floods I'm<br>talking about storms heat waves<br>um and and all of these sort of extreme<br>climate change is<br>experience is already being experienced<br>by yes and what I want to do today is a<br>little bit try to quantify a little bit<br>how much that is<br>okay and maybe give a few more insights<br>about what they<br>want which that cost or extreme weather<br>events<br>um we know<br>that<br>if we look at precipitation<br>moisture coming from the sky climate<br>change is Shifting<br>um Shifting the distribution of the<br>amount of rain that's coming from the<br>sky so if before uh before climate<br>change so let's now imagine what the 100<br>years ago without so much greenhouse<br>gases in the atmosphere that's the<br>amount of precipitation<br>um<br>intensity is blue so you mean that the<br>bottom line is right yeah that's right<br>right<br>so orange uh red was the uh the color<br>before um<br>um<br>so so the red is where precipitation was<br>before climate change and what's climate<br>change is doing already it's Shifting<br>the company right meaning we have more<br>rain why do we have more rain this is<br>sort of primary school science the ocean<br>is warmer and because of that there is<br>more evaporation because of that there's<br>the uh the science here is not<br>groundbreaking<br>so if we think that simultaneously say<br>um<br>it's on the orange side because we are<br>now in a world in which we have scarce<br>um yeah there are plenty of greenhouse<br>gases in the atmosphere so there is now<br>about 420 parts per million for carbon<br>dioxide in the atmosphere right before<br>before we have put all that carbon<br>dioxide in the atmosphere we have the<br>average movement is<br>the the climate is different today<br>okay<br>um so we are on that orange line<br>now the question we can ask then when<br>tropical Cyclone Gabrielle if you<br>compare<br>um that horizontal at vertical shift in<br>the Curve<br>right that basically that distance is by<br>how much was extra because I couldn't<br>have really became more likely because<br>of climate change that's one way to<br>think about it and so we have an<br>experience we have experienced this uh<br>um this storm or the front in Auckland<br>it's the same argument<br>um<br>that event became more likely<br>okay so it's before the event this will<br>be before climate change this was maybe<br>one in I don't know 200 year event now<br>it's a one in 100 team<br>it's becoming more free okay similarly<br>you can think of the horizontal shift in<br>this card<br>it doesn't matter if you you can call it<br>a horizontal shift or you can call it a<br>vertical shift right the horizontal part<br>is by how much<br>um extraordinator cycle Gabrielle became<br>more intense that's a different one<br>think about it<br>right the storm became more intense it<br>dropped for rain<br>because of private change so either it<br>became more frequent that's the radical<br>shift or either it became more intense<br>because of because of climate change<br>it's basically in two sides of the same<br>coin both of these just below together<br>is<br>okay now what I want to do is show you a<br>few papers or a few research projects<br>that I've been involved in in which<br>we've used that concept either the<br>vertical State vertical shape or the<br>horizontal shift to say something about<br>the role of climate change<br>in extreme weather events and<br>specifically because I'm an economist<br>you know climate scientists specifically<br>in economic cost of course<br>okay so I'm going to start with a paper<br>you can see them there<br>um<br>and we look at the costs of the climate<br>change actually using costs of extreme<br>weather events in out there or New<br>Zealand<br>um in terms of<br>um storms sort of floods and droughts<br>right<br>um so look at the floods<br>between the Year 2007 and 2017 why<br>didn't we end in 2017 when we put<br>together that project we started that<br>project<br>so um so the data that we've had 2019<br>the video we had uh what was it 2017.<br>okay so these are all the Big Flats and<br>the cost is only the insured cost for<br>each one of those spots right so how<br>much insurance company paid for those<br>Flats<br>okay why am I looking on anything the<br>insured losses only the ensure damages<br>how much insurance they because that's<br>the only number I know<br>why because we don't know how much these<br>days<br>we only know how much insurance<br>um that's sort of a bit of a sad fact<br>here is that we have actually no idea<br>how much these events cost<br>for example the offline floods or the<br>external cycle of Gabriel floss we will<br>never know if current production<br>practices continue we will never know<br>how much they cost<br>them okay because nobody is collecting<br>that<br>um<br>the one we have we have from the<br>insurance companies actually from the<br>insurance Council which is sort of the<br>domain room for insurance companies<br>um they incorrect the data on on how<br>much their members their insurance<br>companies<br>flood in the North Island<br>now what do we do we look at the what we<br>call the fraction of attributable risk<br>to climate change so the fraction of<br>that event that is actually being able<br>to climate change how do we do that<br>because<br>it's always list of people there are<br>climate scientists they run their<br>climate models<br>weighs 420 parts per million of carbon<br>dioxide in the atmosphere and on the<br>same order with 280 parts per million<br>of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so<br>rather than the climate models with<br>climate change and without climate<br>change and then they look at the<br>difference okay and their conclusion is<br>in for each one of us actually there's a<br>different conclusion for each one of<br>those plus<br>um<br>um a different fraction of that flood is<br>because of climate change<br>why is it different for each drug<br>because the<br>neurological characteristics of that<br>flag were different<br>different fields on different location<br>different you know<br>I don't know<br>atmospheric Rivers were flowing all of<br>um so and then what we basically do is<br>we just multiply the one by the other<br>and then we can say out of for example<br>that that moscosity is Eventing in the<br>North Island in in 2017 35 was because<br>of climate change that meant the 32<br>million dollars is because of climate<br>change so we anyway would have had a<br>flood but that thought would have been<br>significantly less less costly if we<br>okay so you can understand it okay here<br>and when we sort of total that up we get<br>that over that like 10 years from 2007<br>to 2017 uh 140 million dollars of front<br>costs of only the insured flood costs<br>were because of climate change okay so<br>total cost how much I don't know versus<br>purchase so for example just to give you<br>maybe sort of a ball apart figure the<br>treasury produced some preliminary<br>estimates for the floods in February<br>February so the combined events in<br>Auckland and<br>Gabrielle a few days ago and they said<br>at about half of this infrastructure<br>after the damages or infrastructure a<br>quarter is residential damage and a<br>quarter is commercial damage<br>okay the infrastructure is not insured<br>at all<br>um the or almost<br>um the commercial is mainly insured<br>platform a little bit more and<br>residential it's mostly insured<br>so roughly<br>the overall cost at least in this<br>according to this treasury yesterday is<br>about at least three or four times as<br>much as the intrude causes<br>okay so sort of just as I guess market<br>and this is in the gas multiply this by<br>um<br>okay<br>there's only one problem with this and<br>this is if we look at the the same data<br>we used so this is data from the<br>insurance Council<br>okay for every year how much they uh how<br>much are we paying for extreme weather<br>events in how much Insurance Company<br>the insurance companies are paying<br>Insurance damages from uh extreme<br>weather events in New Zealand right you<br>can see the data and the data here and<br>unfortunately the data we used is this<br>circle here<br>so the last few years were what she was<br>before right and we just use the data<br>from just before<br>um sort of alternative classroom<br>okay so if we have done the same if I've<br>done the same analysis today the numbers<br>would have been much much higher<br>okay let me just point out this this<br>this is taken from a recent report when<br>the treasury of the cost of climate<br>change<br>um<br>this graph right so they have for some<br>whatever reason they published this into<br>a um<br>two weeks ago but they don't have 2022<br>and the finger for 2022 is a little bit<br>higher than 2021<br>so it's just over 350. okay and the<br>figure for 2023<br>you don't know we're only what four<br>months into it but it's already at least<br>three times as much as 2022.<br>yes it's much better okay so take the<br>ceiling and go a bit higher and you know<br>hopefully we won't get to the you know<br>the first floor here we won't get the<br>sixth floor uh this year<br>um in terms of the cost<br>so my point is that's 140 million<br>dollars that I've shown you is a vast<br>address both because it does it doesn't<br>contain uninsured damages<br>um and because<br>somehow blacked out and we picked all<br>the<br>small years<br>it costs were not very very hard this is<br>unfortunate because for example in this<br>report<br>um treasuring is um citing that 140<br>million dollar figure<br>quite in quite a few places there<br>um<br>okay that's so that's one way to to<br>think about it and in principle we could<br>do the same thing for for you know think<br>of the event that we just experienced<br>that you experienced here in Auckland<br>and people experiencing therapy and<br>important and so forth we could<br>calculate how much the share of that<br>event is because of that okay<br>all right<br>um and then to calculate how much are we<br>paying because of climate change for<br>this<br>um so<br>we are aim for this<br>okay<br>um another<br>um another research that we've done<br>using the same kind of uh approach uh<br>with different data we looked at um<br>hurricane Harvey which was a hurricane<br>that hit the United States in 2017.<br>okay this was the second costliest<br>hurricane in U.S history what was unique<br>about it is<br>um to quote the president the United<br>States at the time it was very wet<br>and he he added he added from the<br>standpoint of water<br>that's different<br>but but it was right it was very very<br>wrong<br>um<br>hurricanes which is just another name<br>for a tropical Cyclone the damage from<br>them is from almost always almost all<br>the damage is from the water<br>from the rain the flooding the river<br>right flooding the surface flooding and<br>the coastal flooding associated with the<br>storm section but for some mysterious<br>reasons we always classify them by the<br>wind speed so we say you know this is a<br>category three or a category 4 or a<br>category five based on the wind speed<br>when actually that doesn't really matter<br>what matters is how much rain they cost<br>and so we have these sort of counter in<br>doing the situations when for example<br>this hurricane Harvey was only in<br>category three<br>they can go up to category five but it<br>was the the second cause Festival in U.S<br>history after Hurricane Katrina which<br>anyway so<br>um what's what was unique about<br>hurricane Harvey<br>not a very strong hurricane according to<br>the wind speed categories but it moved<br>very very slowly<br>okay and it moved over the ocean when<br>the ocean was unusually warm<br>before it hit land in England just just<br>next to uh<br>so both of these characteristics are<br>associated with climate change right<br>hurricanes or tropical Cyclones move<br>more slowly when they are in the summer<br>so hopefully they move more slowly they<br>drop more rain and age location<br>time<br>um and it had more moisture because the<br>ocean was warmer so there was more<br>evaporation therefore it was more more<br>um so<br>what we do is we combine this this idea<br>that<br>this hurricane became a drop more rain<br>because of climate change<br>okay by how much when the scientists<br>have a bit of a disagreement there but<br>we looked at a bunch of studies and we<br>concluding that<br>um sort of a safe<br>quite consensus but but the sort of a<br>middle middle ground middle estimate is<br>38.<br>foreign<br>of the rain was because of crime<br>so if there was no climate change that<br>hurricane Harvey would have had would<br>have just dropped less right by unlike<br>by 38<br>okay<br>um so then we can sort of uh when we uh<br>map we archaeological uh with flat Maple<br>with flat flat watering we can look at<br>which properties were flooded<br>right and then reduce the amount of rain<br>by 38 and then see which properties<br>would have flooded right fewer<br>properties would have been flooded with<br>38 that's right that's it's an obvious<br>observation right but the question we<br>asked is how many fuel problems<br>and by how much would they brought this<br>because some some properties anyway but<br>so so we do that<br>sort of frog mapping and then we combine<br>that with with some socioeconomic data<br>to say something about the distribution<br>of these<br>things and what do we uh and this is<br>just an example so<br>um again<br>sort of gets the better of me here<br>um but but this is the way that the<br>flood was actually so that's a map of<br>the flood and that's the map of how the<br>flood would have looked at like with 38<br>less right<br>okay you follow me okay and what we can<br>do because it's much more detailed data<br>we can look for every single house in<br>the city of Houston and say how much is<br>flooded and how much you put the flooded<br>less<br>well if there was no climate change<br>okay the thought experiment here is a<br>bit troubling because without climate<br>change the city of Houston wouldn't<br>exist<br>City of Houston is bit on board<br>so it's a bit of a strange concept of<br>Imagining the city of Houston without<br>climate change<br>okay but you know that's the way that's<br>what researching is fantastic<br>okay so what what can we conclude and<br>this is it was a bit of a surprise for<br>us so we will use the rain<br>by 38 percent<br>that meant that 50 fewer properties<br>with the flood<br>so half the properties that have<br>notified if there was only 38 percent<br>so you sort of expect okay 13 less rain<br>okay<br>um so 50 flooded because of climate<br>purely because of climate change 15<br>would have flooded anyway<br>okay now when you look at the um and the<br>damages it's even more extreme<br>right so almost 60 percent of the<br>damages<br>flat<br>change okay so you remove them you<br>reduce the rain by 38 you reduce the<br>amount of properties then<br>um would Float by 50 and you reduce the<br>amount of Damages by 60.<br>okay so that's quite a quite as striking<br>I think<br>um piece of information so just by<br>making the event<br>somewhat stronger we are increasing the<br>damages by much more<br>okay<br>so that's that's one thing we can<br>we can say about this now this is true<br>in the context of of hurricane Harvey in<br>um<br>the other thing we can do is we can we<br>can<br>um sort of look at more sort of<br>socioeconomic characteristics of that<br>that plot and what we find is<br>um to our surprise again uh it's<br>sometimes nice about this if you find<br>things<br>Hispanics were more exposed to this<br>um to this um climate change industry<br>so you can sort of divide the whole<br>population of of Houston into six groups<br>right<br>um one one is those living in properties<br>that were not flooded at all<br>okay<br>seeing is is uh groups that<br>um flooded but wouldn't anyway father<br>even if we remove 38 of<br>the uh the rain<br>and B properties that flooded but if we<br>remove 38 of the flood they wouldn't<br>frown<br>okay<br>um so and then we can also divide them<br>between those that were in short and<br>those that were uninsured<br>fortunately for us<br>that distinction is less relevant here<br>because most people aren't sure not<br>everyone but by far bigger share of the<br>population<br>but past events suggested<br>insurance policy yeah that's true in the<br>USB<br>um as well um but<br>sort of<br>um yes so when you<br>um when you issue a mortgage when you go<br>to get a mortgage from from a bank here<br>they will insist you buy insurance<br>um they don't monitor that you continue<br>buying Insurance afterwards<br>right so it's only at the time of<br>issuance of the mortgage<br>that that they check now in principle<br>you're still obligated to maintain<br>insurance<br>so if the bank retroactive you find out<br>wait a minute you didn't have insurance<br>they can that's that's what they call a<br>technical reform if you're deformity<br>right but in practice they don't they<br>don't monitor this they don't monitor it<br>here and they don't monitor it um in the<br>US as well can I just ask it's this is<br>yeah we don't have any information about<br>um<br>commercial properties<br>um not there I mean actually<br>not here it's very difficult to do<br>research on a commercial property it's<br>also an easier because we have a lot<br>so so the the number here the percentage<br>is the percentage of those houses that<br>are owned by Hispanics and you can see<br>that the sort of<br>this one no<br>um<br>there seems to be a concentration of<br>Hispanics<br>in the uninsured properties that were<br>right<br>okay but this this one one reason so you<br>you can you cannot you can think okay<br>but this is because Hispanics are<br>um relatively lower income and we know<br>that your income first of all are<br>investing sure and also they live in<br>more hazardous locations uh and to some<br>extent that's true in Opera as well<br>um<br>it's all true but you know there's<br>another group in in Houston that is<br>similarly low income and that is the the<br>African-Americans and we don't see the<br>um<br>why exactly we're not<br>to be honestly sure<br>um it probably has to do with the fact<br>that a lot of the Hispanic community in<br>immigrants of course there is science on<br>their way before the rainbows game<br>um but there's sort of two populations<br>right this is the one that<br>um the came way back and the ones that<br>came recently and we think it's about<br>though that those groups that came<br>recently and sort of<br>went in seconds in the places that no<br>um problematic<br>areas<br>um<br>I'm saying communities because Houston<br>is highly segregated so that is sort of<br>you can really see the pattern of advice<br>so that's that's what you can see this<br>patterns<br>um<br>one more<br>um research projects that they want to<br>tell you about that feels the same kind<br>of same kind of approach<br>um and that's together with the<br>Rebecca<br>and what we try to do is sort of we've<br>talked about out there around New<br>Zealand we've talked about hurricane<br>Harvey let's let's go over on<br>okay<br>um so what we do is we look at all the<br>attribution studies that people have<br>done for specific events globally so in<br>the same you know in the same way that<br>for Hurricane Harvey decided to set 38<br>of the rain is because of climate change<br>people have done that for other<br>other events in other places so for<br>example you remember there was a heat<br>wave<br>um<br>that's my job but um<br>um uh there was a heat wave in North the<br>west coast of North America<br>two years ago<br>um<br>Oregon California British Columbia<br>Washington<br>so there was attribution research on<br>this and they basically concluded that<br>that event would have been impossible<br>so fully hundred percent of the<br>likelihood of that event is because of<br>advantage<br>okay that event was very unusual<br>so in some places in Oregon for example<br>they measured temperatures<br>um five degrees Celsius higher than ever<br>okay and and similarly other you know<br>other research on other events in you<br>know tropical Cyclone India in<br>Mozambique and and the floods in Germany<br>that you might remember it was last year<br>Francis killed almost 200 people in<br>Germany<br>um various other events and there's a<br>bunch of attribution studies about it so<br>we collect all those attribution studies<br>uh which basically 250 papers on 179<br>extreme weather events are normally<br>okay and then we match those with<br>with economic costs so if you look at<br>the<br>conclusions from these attribution<br>studies<br>all right<br>um so take heatwaves for example that's<br>on the uh on the left there<br>um<br>on average 77 percent<br>um they're actually under the heat wave<br>increased by 77<br>okay globally in the last 12 years<br>okay the likelihood of floods increased<br>by only 20 percent<br>lower<br>okay that's why I said you know my sort<br>of ballpark case for All for Our Guests<br>broken would be 20<br>okay the average globally for floods is<br>20 the average for Heatwave is 77 heat<br>okay with flood is a bit more it's a bit<br>more complicated because it's not just<br>the factors there is moisture in the<br>atmosphere for a family so the pattern<br>of concentrated rain in a specific<br>period of time<br>um and in some places actually they are<br>driving up rather than than getting more<br>wet we know that the patterns already is<br>changing<br>it's even right we are probably going to<br>so what you can see there is um if I may<br>is for heat waves it's 77 is the average<br>but some events are one I mean 100<br>that's that is<br>in some events are only becoming more<br>likely by maybe<br>foreign<br>okay so there is a range but the average<br>is seven cents okay now you wouldn't be<br>surprised to to know that cold waves are<br>global<br>um<br>no terribly surprises in global warming<br>um so you think you need me to tell you<br>that but but current events are becoming<br>less<br>less likely so<br>we are experiencing fewer costs<br>associated with cold events but more<br>costs associated with floods and heat<br>waves and so on and so on regret them<br>being<br>it's very large and if you look globally<br>in what we are experiencing and have<br>always experienced heat waves and floods<br>and jobs and so forth are much much more<br>distraction<br>okay<br>um then what we do is<br>um<br>we've<br>um<br>we match each one of those events of<br>those tax events between the cost so we<br>use the global data sets for costs or<br>disasters<br>um and we match those two things and we<br>multiply so if if we know for example<br>um equates that one big loss and that is<br>higher mortality<br>we typically don't measure that<br>so we have very few instances in which<br>we know<br>um what is the cost of working so heat<br>waves are so not in our calculation<br>because<br>okay so if you look at the global the<br>most popular global data sets uh data<br>set on disasters<br>um that's the status is collected by uh<br>a university in Beijing<br>um<br>they have in their database of the cost<br>of all disasters normally there are no<br>why is never measured it costs<br>England<br>um we do have<br>um<br>measured 40 degrees in the UK<br>um we know how many people got it we<br>just seem to excess mortality around the<br>time of day anyway probably an hour<br>three years of coffee you might be<br>familiar with the internal access<br>mortality<br>um yeah<br>so<br>um so we know in England but we have<br>um<br>okay but what we do is whenever we can<br>we match with the existing economic data<br>and then we calculate okay from extreme<br>weather events what is the cost of uh of<br>and these bars are eight percent of<br>global GDP<br>okay so some years now much worse than<br>other because we had some big events<br>um<br>but on on sort of average it's about<br>um<br>a half a percentage worth of I think<br>less than half a percentage point of<br>diploma<br>okay<br>um but it fluctuates over them it's<br>roughly<br>cost or all disasters associated with<br>annually<br>okay so in the last 20 years<br>the cost of climate change in terms of<br>extreme weather events was 143 billion<br>dollars<br>the next question is this song<br>okay<br>this one that we have actually more than<br>it is but um that's not saying much or<br>anything country<br>um<br>but if you look at for example you know<br>a nice a good comparison would be how<br>much are we willing to pay for<br>adaptation and integration to the<br>agreement was signed in 2015 the<br>uh the world basically has agreed to pay<br>a hundred billion dollars per year<br>for incubation and adaptation together<br>so both to cover the cost of reducing<br>greenhouse gases and to pay for whatever<br>um adaptation needs to be done in<br>practice only about 10 went to<br>adaptation<br>so but in principle<br>the problem is worth 10 billion dollars<br>but what I'm arguing here is just for<br>that adaptation part<br>the costs were already varying is 143<br>billion it's not the 10 billion that<br>we've promised to pay for it<br>so so the cost of climate change as we<br>are measuring it is actually way more<br>than what we seem to be suggesting when<br>United Nations for anyone for<br>climate change something like missing a<br>okay<br>um<br>okay so so that's um there is another I<br>don't have a slide on it but but I'm the<br>the most<br>common way to assess the cost of climate<br>change<br>um is to run these what they call<br>Integrated assessment models familiar<br>with the term anyone<br>okay these are integrated so these are<br>models of the climate with the model of<br>the economy and they are integrated<br>together a new crop and sort of crunch<br>there the models up and you calculate<br>the cost and what we do in this paper is<br>we show that our number is way way<br>bigger than what those integrated<br>assessment models seem to be suggesting<br>okay why we argue because those<br>integrated assessment models are very<br>religion first slide and put here<br>they're looking at the average change to<br>change in the temperature<br>that I'm using and we think they learn<br>using the wrong matching but they need<br>to be thinking about it<br>and the change in the frequency and<br>there's other things you can do with the<br>same kind of approach<br>um I can calculate of that 143 million<br>dollars how much each of you is<br>responsible<br>okay given your age even your you know<br>how much commuting you do or how much<br>you plug into on average so we know that<br>on average how many you know how many<br>um of course let me know so we can<br>calculate how much would they you know<br>my example is a 50 year old 53 year old<br>um person who may lives in New Zealand<br>how much I've produced<br>um<br>on average carbon dioxide over my<br>lifetime<br>okay and that will give me a dollar<br>figure out of that 143 billion dollar<br>how much is my fault<br>anybody I can do you know for each one<br>um<br>so so you can sort of<br>switch that and actually look at sort of<br>first uh we're actually working on a<br>project<br>right now<br>um<br>and I think the other interesting thing<br>is that you can use this kind of<br>attribution approach<br>um to start to convince people if<br>they're convincing that that climate<br>change is reading is affecting them so<br>we are trying to design a project that<br>looks at Hurricane Harvey<br>because we know exactly each property<br>in Houston which one of them were<br>flooded because of climate change so we<br>are sort of trying to develop a project<br>that actually made 10 of people<br>um in those addresses<br>flood that flood was because of climate<br>change and then we can investigate<br>whether they change their views or not<br>managing so climate change denialism is<br>not<br>comedy<br>videos employees in New Zealand Texas<br>so potentially can we can we shift<br>people because when you talk about<br>climate change and the cost of climate<br>change people don't<br>understand that this is this is actually<br>touching there<br>but when you turn someone okay your your<br>house was flooded because of climate<br>change and if there was no climate<br>change your house wouldn't have flooded<br>then potentially that's a that's a<br>that's a persuasion uh we're trying to<br>um I think I'm<br>happy to stop now and um sort of<br>information</p></main><footer
