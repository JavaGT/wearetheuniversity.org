this<br>special occasion to celebrate Catherine<br>Fowler's promotion to Professor<br>these lectures are special and a great<br>opportunity for us to take a time out of<br>our busy lives to listen to our amazing<br>staff and broaden our understanding of<br>research across the University<br>I'd like to welcome many colleagues from<br>across the university as well as<br>students and friends but I'd like to<br>give a very special welcome to<br>Catherine's family her husband Martin<br>and daughter Imogen and Son Joseph and<br>to the various people who are listening<br>or watching overseas<br>so promotion to Professor otago is not<br>something that is easily achieved and<br>Professor Fowler has gone through a<br>rigorous process where she's<br>demonstrated that she's achieved<br>sustained outstanding leadership in<br>research teaching and service<br>Catherine is an internationally<br>recognized film scholar how Publications<br>in campus work on film and the visual<br>arts women filmmakers and the<br>relationships between space place and<br>identity in European Cinemas<br>as well as that she has shown leadership<br>in teaching both within otago and<br>internationally and has shown leadership<br>and service at otago and within her<br>discipline<br>for me it's particularly special to<br>introduce Professor Fowler<br>I first met Catherine soon after she and<br>her family arrived in Dunedin in 2004<br>but I'd heard about it her before then<br>because Catherine grew up in clevedon in<br>the UK where I used to live and as in<br>happens in small towns<br>Catherine's mum was a friend of a good<br>friend of mine and so we were there we<br>were able to welcome her when she came<br>so Catherine since then I've followed<br>your career with interest and I'm<br>delighted to see you provided Professor<br>so congratulations and I really look<br>forward to your lecture and I'm now<br>going to hand over to Professor vochi<br>who's going to give a more detailed<br>I teach Chinese Asian studies and I<br>direct the Global Studies program here<br>at otago what am I doing here right<br>you're probably wonder why I'm here to<br>introduce a new professor in the program<br>of media film and communication there is<br>indeed an inter-academic and<br>intellectual explanation for my presence<br>here my disciplinary area is indeed in<br>film and media and I share Professor<br>Fowler's scholarly interest and passion<br>for the moving image as a key location<br>for conceptualizing understanding and<br>acting in the world<br>but most importantly I'm here because I<br>know Professor Fowler I know Kathy and<br>I'm here to tell you that she's one of a<br>kind a world-class scholar respected and<br>admired by her peers I have clear<br>evidence if you want me to list all the<br>important Scholars that have cited their<br>work she's a creative and tireless<br>teacher and something that I would argue<br>is most special and even more rare<br>she's a truly generous colleague<br>let me start by telling you about her<br>deep knowledge of a wide range of<br>scholarly interests<br>cuttings work focuses on the key<br>relationship between film and art and<br>she has published in National Cinemas<br>French Cinema Belgium and of course<br>European Cinema with a particular focus<br>on authorships feminism and film<br>here I can only mention some of her<br>books her monographs included a BFI<br>Classic on John Dilma<br>and another monograph on Sally Potter<br>and then a series of edited volume the<br>most recent one with Terry Higgins who<br>is here today and epistolary<br>entanglement in film media and visual<br>arts and<br>um earlier edited collection on<br>representing the rural space place and<br>identity in films about the land and the<br>European Cinema reader now mentioning<br>this edited collection also gives me an<br>opportunity to speak to Kathy amazing<br>talent he has simply say a wonderful<br>intellectual Community Builder so I have<br>been you know inspired and I read her<br>solo authored work but I also benefit<br>firsthand from her ability to create<br>connection and bridges to value others<br>people work and to find ways to develop<br>Partnerships it's no chance it's not<br>just by chance that she has so many<br>special special edition of edited<br>collection because Kathy can indeed<br>create those kind of bridges so she<br>reached out to me and in this room to<br>Terry and Rochelle and many other to<br>credit for instance a special issue she<br>came to me oh Paula let's go write this<br>essay together and I couldn't be more<br>grateful for the things that she<br>inspired me to do applying for the<br>William Evans together and get Professor<br>Francisco cassetti here and create an<br>event around that she involved me in her<br>latest Adventure in editing a special<br>issue of in transition this is a video<br>graphic film and moving image journal<br>and she simply simply came to me and<br>said okay Paula we're doom I'm doing<br>this special issue and I want to do an<br>update videographic feministiptic usual<br>audio visual tools tools to post<br>feminist questions and say great Kathy<br>and she said well you need to be part of<br>that I said what I have never done a<br>video essay in my life but um she says<br>but you can contribute something from<br>your research and I said well okay I<br>could do it and in fact easy peasy 10<br>000 hours later of work after having<br>learned how to do a video essay but I<br>learned so much thanks to Kathy I met<br>colleagues I would have never met and<br>especially was inspired by her video<br>essay which I just hoped you guys could<br>see it will come out soon some of you I<br>had the pleasure of seeing it in one of<br>the seminars she gave for mafco<br>Beyond publication Kathy creates<br>collaborative events as I said and<br>community in um in both at the local<br>level and the national International<br>level you might have heard her talking<br>at the Saturday morning Kim Hill in fact<br>about John Dillman or you might have<br>gone to her public lectures here in<br>Dunedin which obviously Auckland<br>Wellington but she also has been invited<br>to speak West Mr Glasgow University Cafe<br>in Italy in France Serbia Canada and she<br>got a Fulbright well to to speak and to<br>contribute to places like uscla Yale and<br>Harvard she's also an amazing<br>undergraduate teacher she has been<br>nominated as the best you know<br>supervisor twice and she has initiated<br>again reaching out a collaboration with<br>this minor with this science<br>communication program and establishing<br>successfully launching manner of science<br>community Nation finally I can have to<br>mention your implementation of very<br>creative Night Part form of her<br>assessment not only she invited me to do<br>this video essay right but she also<br>asked her students to contribute their<br>assessment through this new form a<br>creative way of<br>um<br>a video essay format okay I'm going to<br>stop here yay because I really want to<br>make my introduction as short as<br>possible to give the floor to really<br>really here to listen to so I hope I<br>manage this time to stay within my time<br>minute slot I gave you the floor casting<br>I gave you the mic and<br>because you can't escape this from me I<br>want to give you a last hug when you<br>come here so ladies and gentlemen this<br>is very you know you know Hollywood<br>style oscar style but I give you<br>Professor Fowler I give you Cassie a<br>wonderful scholar and even more<br>wonderful colleague and truly lucky me a<br>wonderful friend come on<br>Paula<br>foreign<br>norera<br>I probably don't need to tell you the<br>title of this film that you're watching<br>is a sentence you won't hear me saying<br>when I talk about any of the films I've<br>written about<br>across my work I focused on what I call<br>eccentric Cinema<br>short and feature-length films and<br>videos by Belgian filmmakers women<br>filmmakers and contemporary artists<br>they'll largely go out unseen outside of<br>the small countries limited Festival<br>screenings and transient installations<br>in gallery spaces<br>the films I've written about are not<br>popular they're not profitable they're<br>not mainstream<br>if you met me at a party it's unlikely<br>we'd Bond over our favorite films<br>although they're probably a lot of<br>polite nodding<br>and if we're caught in a lift together<br>I'd probably need the endless flaws of a<br>skyscraper to tell you what I do<br>until very recently this film that<br>you're seeing here<br>fit perfectly into these categories of<br>security and marginality<br>then in December 2022 everything changed<br>so much so that I ended up on the<br>Saturday morning Kim Hill show Powell<br>has spoiled that<br>it's a movie most people have never<br>heard of<br>it's nearly three and a half hours long<br>it's by Belgian director Chantal<br>Ackerman<br>and 1600 critics and academics worldwide<br>this week have voted at the greatest<br>as you can probably tell from Kim's tone<br>the world of film criticism has been<br>left reeling from the result of The<br>Sight and Sound 2022 Poll for best film<br>this is because this little-known 1975<br>film by Belgian Jewish woman director<br>entitled jandilman knocked some very<br>famous films off the top namely Citizen<br>Kane and vertigo which I know you will<br>have heard of<br>which have been taking turns for the<br>last 50 years at the top<br>what has got everyone so worked up is<br>the unpopular and even radical nature of<br>jandilman<br>the film focuses on Jan who we see here<br>who is a widow in her late 40s with a<br>son of 16. the film takes place over<br>three days of her life and shows us her<br>daily routine as a housewife in wearying<br>detail<br>in the afternoons between cooking dinner<br>and serving it she hosts male visitors<br>who disappear with her into the bedroom<br>over the course of the three days so we<br>become accustomed to zhan's routine<br>noting changes in the small repetitions<br>that order her world until gradually her<br>world unravels in the final seven<br>minutes<br>the Triumph of Jean dilman in the world<br>of film criticism differences the Canon<br>as our historian Griselda Pollock might<br>put it<br>it also provides one answer to the<br>question that I feel compelled to start<br>with<br>why study film<br>is a young discipline only 40 years old<br>and sorry with only a 40-year record of<br>securing a place in the academy<br>the question of why we should study it<br>has pursued it even up to the present<br>day<br>the first film course was offered in New<br>Zealand at Victoria University in 1972<br>and the first and it was first taught in<br>schools in 1977.<br>yet Roger Horrocks who's been Central to<br>film education and scholarship in this<br>country records reactions to the study<br>of film in New Zealand this way<br>film studies was perceived by<br>conservative teachers and academics as a<br>dangerous newcomer<br>dangerous because it was a trojan horse<br>a conspiracy to subvert the hierarchies<br>once films were admitted the doors of<br>the academy would be open to<br>contemporary popular culture in all its<br>vulgar forms from pop music to soap<br>operas to horror films to comic books<br>haven't helped us<br>since I've already told you that I don't<br>study popular films it may seem that you<br>have nothing to fear by letting me into<br>the academy<br>but in fact even eccentric Cinemas which<br>can be studied through the established<br>lenses of Aesthetics and art history<br>have had to fight for inclusion<br>the answer to the question why study<br>something is usually because the object<br>of study is important it matters<br>in the Arts and Humanities this<br>muttering has tended to be affirmed in<br>one of two ways<br>the formal aesthetic or the social<br>ideological<br>the first would argue for or assume the<br>importance of film in terms of its<br>intrinsic worth<br>whereas the latter focuses on film's<br>position as symptom or influence in<br>Social processes<br>my work addresses both forms of<br>mattering<br>as a study of Cinema that is operating<br>at the margins of film practice it has<br>various it has in various ways had to<br>engage with power relations<br>this emphasis on power relations directs<br>attention both to the uses of the camera<br>as a representational practice the<br>formal aesthetic or how meaning is<br>produced<br>on to cinema as an economic and<br>political structure that circulates ways<br>of interpreting and consuming the world<br>the social ideological or the effects<br>and consequences of the knowledge that<br>because I understand the camera as a<br>representational practice it's important<br>for me to show you actual films in this<br>lecture rather than just referring to<br>them or describing them<br>my method then is grounded in observable<br>detail<br>film Scholars would call this approach<br>measlesen analysis<br>mizon-sen literally meaning to put on<br>stage might be defined as the contents<br>of the frame and the way they're<br>organized<br>it encompasses both what the audiences<br>can see so here zhan a housewife<br>repairing food in her kitchen<br>and the way in which we're invited to<br>see it<br>through a static shot that is held until<br>the completion of an action<br>and until Jan exits the space<br>and just to warn you that you're<br>probably going to see this twice so<br>I inherit a tradition of close looking<br>and close description that parallels<br>iconographic analysis in art history and<br>close reading in literary studies<br>equally methods and attitudes about<br>seeing and interpreting films have<br>strongly influenced my viewing teaching<br>and writing in the field<br>Theory never precedes my interest in an<br>trying the formal aesthetic approach out<br>on John Dillman here we could argue that<br>the film should be studied because it is<br>formally an aesthetically radical<br>first it challenges what film history is<br>considered watchable and unwatchable<br>maybe some of you are having that<br>experience now<br>reversing the accepted hierarchy of<br>images by making everyday images of a<br>woman cooking more important than a car<br>crash or a kiss<br>further ackerman's stylistic choices<br>when filming Jam provide a kind of audio<br>visual detox from our usual privileged<br>viewing position<br>because as you see from this scene of<br>the making of Vena schnitzel I know you<br>all knew what she was doing<br>on day one there is very little editing<br>instead Chantal Ackerman refuses the<br>full range of devices through which a<br>film can be said to interpret the<br>surface of the world and inflect it with<br>levels of significance<br>if we think of conventional editing as a<br>kind of pointing so things are pointed<br>out to us then Ackerman gives us no help<br>instead we see cleaning cooking and<br>shopping in their full duration with no<br>ellipses<br>each space in 23 kaidu Commerce in<br>Brussels the kitchen here but also the<br>living room and the bedroom is framed in<br>full there are no close-ups or zooms no<br>camera angles or camera movements and<br>we're positioned in relation to Jan at a<br>neutral distance<br>similarly there are no point of view<br>shots to show us what she's seeing or to<br>promote identification or heighten<br>emotional intensity<br>thus chantalakam eliminates the kind of<br>stylistic features that constitute other<br>directors such as Wells and Hitchcock's<br>film style<br>why does she do so<br>her answer quote it was the only way to<br>shoot that film<br>to avoid cutting the woman into a<br>hundred pieces to avoid cutting the<br>action into a hundred pieces<br>to look carefully<br>this obligation that Ackerman clearly<br>feels to depict Jan with care and<br>respect points towards the second<br>justification for why a film matters the<br>social and ideological<br>we find that John Dillman accomplishes<br>something that very few other films have<br>managed it makes the labor of the<br>housewife and mother seen<br>by staying with Jan in the kitchen the<br>film ensures that it offers an analysis<br>of Oppression and a critique of marriage<br>motherhood and family that aligns with<br>second wave feminism's emphasis upon<br>personal relations as the site for<br>liberation<br>it's a movie most people have never<br>heard of she will never shut up will she<br>this is why we're meant to go okay so<br>now you know one fact about me<br>through close analysis I work on Cinema<br>that some think of as insignificant but<br>I passionately believe needs our<br>attention<br>not surprisingly I'll take this<br>opportunity of having your attention to<br>talk about it in more depth<br>but before I do do so here's a second<br>fact<br>I understand that I'm privileged<br>and it will perhaps be more surprising<br>to you that in the course of talking<br>about this Cinema or taking the<br>opportunity to reflect upon the<br>privileged position I find myself in of<br>it's a funny word privilege we can think<br>of it as having performative qualities<br>the philosopher of language J.L Austin<br>refers to such phrases as I do which<br>when uttered in particular miso sen can<br>perform legal and symbolic actions<br>we can think of the phrase I'm<br>privileged when said out loud in an IPL<br>in the same way<br>when linked to the adjective advantaged<br>I'm privileged performs gratitude and<br>acknowledges good fortune<br>but I can't help wondering about the<br>other adjectives linked to privileged as<br>in privileged information<br>knowledge then that is confidential<br>restricted and limited<br>perhaps acknowledging one's privilege is<br>not enough<br>instead rather than just saying I am<br>privileged and leaving it at that I want<br>to use this lecture to acknowledge how<br>it is that I have privilege<br>I'll analyze the opacity of privileged<br>so as to make transparent how much it<br>depends upon the work and support and<br>Care given so often for free by other<br>people<br>given that I work with sound and image<br>let's start with what privilege looks<br>like<br>it looks like there's space here to my<br>left or right<br>the generic IPL poster frames the<br>professor in empty space<br>as if they've acquired their position<br>and earned their IPL all by themselves<br>of course this cannot possibly be the<br>case<br>therefore across my talk I frequently<br>paused to edit people into this frame<br>with me<br>and it seems appropriate to start with<br>Professor Nicholson and Professor vochi<br>I told you I was coming back<br>I couldn't be more thrilled to have the<br>two of you in front of me<br>because over the years you've both given<br>me examples of what it sounds like to<br>make privilege transparent<br>because of the clevedon connection my<br>family and I were fortunate to have<br>Helen greet us when we landed in Dunedin<br>a little sleepy and disheveled<br>but my first really impressive<br>impression of Helen was as part of a<br>women's caucus event some years later in<br>which she talked to a wrapped audience<br>about her Reflections upon women and<br>Leadership you probably don't remember<br>I remember her opening line which was<br>I am just like you<br>the talk that followed then continued to<br>demystify leadership detailing in<br>concrete terms a path that twisted and<br>turned guided and supported by many<br>people along the way rather than a<br>meteoric rise<br>Helen's talk was itself a way of handing<br>the Baton to us<br>now to Paola<br>anyone who knows Paula will understand<br>what I mean when I say that she makes<br>privileged transparent so see through<br>that it almost disappears<br>it was in fact Paula Who convinced me to<br>apply for professor<br>and that tells you everything that you<br>need to know about her<br>she's constantly lifting other people up<br>with her<br>and that's not easy when you're a small<br>person<br>and above her<br>so Professor Nicholson and Professor<br>Bocce I feel very fortunate and grateful<br>to be able to follow you in the order of<br>ceremony and in my academic life at<br>otago<br>this lecture is in five parts and we're<br>at the end of part one<br>in part two I will address the title of<br>this lecture and elaborate the key<br>questions that underpin my scholarship<br>the rest of the lecture will then divide<br>into three each part more or less<br>chronologically aligned with my research<br>Journey<br>first under contestation I'll offer a<br>brief Glimpse from my post-phd work into<br>early Belgian Cinema<br>which is eccentric because of the<br>smallness of the country and thus than<br>the minority share of audience as well<br>as because of the linguistic divisions<br>between francophone and Flemish speakers<br>in part two I focus upon artists film<br>and video which I began to study while<br>moving to arteroa New Zealand<br>such work is eccentric because it<br>operates beyond the reaches of the<br>cinema Auditorium in Contemporary Art<br>spaces and eccentric with a C<br>C<br>because it aims to push our<br>understanding of what a moving image is<br>finally in a much smaller section<br>shorter section under the heading<br>confrontation are briefly returned to my<br>opening film Jan zilman to wrap things<br>up<br>the question how do I add to the images<br>in movies which is my title repeats the<br>words of French cultural theorist Roland<br>Bart<br>writing in 1980 he says do I add to the<br>images in movies I don't think so I<br>don't have time in front of the screen<br>I'm not free to shut my eyes otherwise<br>opening them again I would not discover<br>the same image I'm constrained to a<br>continuous veracity<br>a host of other qualities but not<br>pensiveness<br>Bart's lament is made in his book camera<br>lucida in which she sets out to learn<br>what photography is in itself<br>in other words he wants to try to pin<br>down the specificity of photography<br>he makes two points that are important<br>for my own work<br>first he states that the photographic<br>image has a singularity about it there<br>is only one and he contrasts this with<br>the multiplicity of cinematic images<br>second he complains that the insatiable<br>parade of images in the cinema<br>that keep appearing and then<br>disappearing is constraining<br>making it impossible for him to isolate<br>one to think about<br>because Cinema is time based then and<br>involves a montage of images he<br>complains that we're not in control of<br>our own engagement as we might be when<br>we're reading a book or observing a<br>painting<br>Bart's characterization of Cinema<br>coheres with one path that film studies<br>is carved out to explain its development<br>and manifest destiny<br>that is that it was fated to tell<br>stories albeit in an audio visual form<br>accordingly the development from the<br>single images that were projected around<br>the world at its birth in 1895 to<br>multiple images came about in order to<br>involve the viewer in a story and to<br>so<br>so I've got two examples here we've got<br>rippers done baby or baby's dinner by<br>Louis Lumiere in 1895 so right at the<br>birth of Cinema<br>and Rescue by Rover 10 years later<br>we can contrast the single shot that<br>chooses a position from which to frame<br>the world but then leaves us alone to<br>look at it<br>with the accumulation of shots in<br>rescued by Rover and this is actually a<br>very early example of continuity editing<br>so you can see it's quite rough<br>in Rescue by Rover elements from one<br>shot continue into shot two so as to<br>persuade is that time and space are<br>continuous and the element as you'll see<br>is the dog Rover and Rover's owner as<br>well<br>as a modern day audience<br>familiar with what editing affords we'd<br>probably argue that rescue by Rover is<br>more interesting than baby's dinner<br>Rover feels fast because of the<br>continuous veracity of which BART speaks<br>and baby's dinner feels slow<br>Rover moves us forward in time and out<br>of Bart's control while baby's dinner<br>seems to stay with the moment<br>of baby's dinner it's been recorded that<br>audiences at the time reacted not by<br>being fascinated by the family group<br>this is no you've been framed experience<br>but instead by the trees in the<br>background and I'm sure you'll agree as<br>a modern day audience you really have to<br>look carefully to actually see the trees<br>what moving images afforded then that<br>still photography had not was the sight<br>of the wind in the trees<br>The Wonder of early audiences over<br>baby's dinner leads us to a second path<br>that has been carved out and it's been<br>art used to argue that narrative was<br>only one of the possibilities for films<br>before 1906 but not the ultimate<br>destination<br>it goes by the name the cinema of<br>attraction<br>and it focuses upon the way in which the<br>single shot shows us something<br>for its author here Tom gunning the<br>cinema of attractions makes images seen<br>harnessing visibility<br>and performs an act of showing an<br>exhibition that tells a different story<br>for Cinema<br>for gunning The Sinner of Attraction<br>goes underground into certain<br>avant-garde practice and certain genres<br>such as the musical or action film<br>what these examples share is a liking<br>for spectacle<br>in other words the creation of visual<br>impact<br>although Music and Sound also contribute<br>think musical numbers in the musicals<br>and fight scenes in action films<br>gunning's thesis crafted in 1983 that<br>some early films like to show off their<br>ability to show<br>undercuts that other history in which<br>film editing develops with the sole<br>purpose to absorb us in a story<br>the battle that gunning initiates is one<br>close to Bart's heart because it's about<br>what film is in itself<br>often this battle was conducted under<br>the guise of pinning down film language<br>which refers mostly to the systems of<br>editing but also meizonsen camera and<br>narrative arrangement of a shot that<br>we've just seen in Rescue by Rover is a<br>language<br>what a strange language it is<br>unlike writing or speech this kind of<br>language in the service of narrative<br>does not often have abstract and<br>descriptive qualities but I'll return to<br>that<br>it cannot say<br>all Oaks produce acorns<br>it cannot say this is not a pipe there's<br>a reference to paola's IPL for those of<br>us who saw it<br>but it can say<br>look at how Rover runs through the<br>Stream<br>or see how the Gypsy who stole the baby<br>shows no remorse<br>whilst both rescued by Rover and babies<br>dinner say look<br>in the first there are conditions<br>attached<br>in Rove then it is look at this then<br>look at this<br>the velocity of which BART complains or<br>look at this because it causes that to<br>happen<br>the chain of events unfolding in space<br>and time that constitute a narrative and<br>take us away from the moment<br>by contrast baby's dinner says look at<br>this family in their Garden<br>to return to John Dillman<br>that film inherits some of the<br>intentions of the long take so we can<br>think of this keep looking as the long<br>take the long unedited take and it sits<br>somewhere between baby's dinner and um<br>Rover<br>so there is the underlying forward<br>momentum of the narrative<br>yet because Ackerman avoids pointing we<br>are given more time to look<br>more importantly the film only makes<br>sense if we're prepared to look<br>attentively at the actress Delphine<br>cerix performance of the rituals and<br>gestures that give order to Jan's world<br>and understand that when we're forced to<br>watch the prolonged preparation of Venus<br>schnitzel as I just made you do<br>what Ackerman is saying is<br>notice how zhan is able to restore some<br>by focusing on film language in the form<br>of the long take that shows and says<br>just look we unlock the door to an<br>alternative Passage through film history<br>in the time remaining I'll turn to three<br>of the many roots that come off that<br>passage revealed through close analysis<br>with each in turn leading to three<br>common attitudes for eccentric Cinema<br>contestation contemplation and<br>confrontation<br>our first route focuses on Films made in<br>Belgium between 1911 and 14. you'll see<br>why we won't have much to say at a party<br>about films<br>by Frenchman Alfred masham<br>this case study takes us back to the<br>second half of the 90s in the period<br>after my PhD on Chantal Ackerman so let<br>me rewind a little further to explain<br>how I got there<br>my first degree was in film and drama<br>and I studied at bulmersh College in<br>Reading in the UK<br>I'd ended up at Bull merch because I was<br>trying to avoid having to study the<br>combination of English and drama sorry<br>English<br>film and drama seemed a good alternative<br>by the end of the first year however I'd<br>switch my allegiances from the stage to<br>the screen<br>I would have to wait until my third year<br>however before I encountered what was<br>called at the time Alternative forms in<br>cinema and saw my first Chantal<br>ackermann film so I don't know if you<br>can see it but it was<br>oh<br>yeah<br>yeah my training in Meson set analysis<br>came from my lecturers at ballmerch the<br>late Jim Hillier and Doug pie<br>both of whom have been involved in the<br>film Journal movie who you see here<br>Infamous for its publication of rigorous<br>detail film criticism<br>the scaffolding for my privilege begins<br>here<br>Jim Hillier introduced me to Alternative<br>forms in shotalakamum while Doug Pai<br>suggested that instead of going to train<br>to be a news reader<br>I kid you not<br>I apply to Warwick to study a PhD<br>in addition to these formative<br>influences an unexpected mentorship that<br>has been sustained came from David<br>lustered<br>David's teaching of realism and third<br>Cinema remains an inspiration for my own<br>teaching to this day<br>only later did I get to read his<br>important essay why pedagogy<br>in which she encourages us to think<br>about knowledge as having a materiality<br>that is created when teacher and student<br>come together to test protest and<br>contest what is understood in other<br>words knowledge does not pre-exist the<br>teaching space<br>instead he says knowledge is not the<br>matter that is offered so much as the<br>matter that is understood<br>I'm thrilled to say that I've been able<br>to repay David since when I got my first<br>position in Southampton four years later<br>he became a colleague and most recently<br>I was able to bring David to otago to<br>very successfully teach a summer school<br>another step forward the British Academy<br>in the UK made it possible for me to be<br>one of the advantage of you who get to<br>study for a PhD<br>for three weeks though I got to see what<br>it felt like to be one of the<br>disadvantaged many as an initial letter<br>informed me that I had not been<br>successful<br>before a second one corrected that and<br>told me I had indeed got a bursary I've<br>never worked out what went on there but<br>in my thesis I attempted to broaden the<br>critical boundaries within which the<br>films of Chantal Ackerman had been<br>discussed<br>by adding to debates about her gender<br>and aesthetic identity as an independent<br>filmmaker discussions of how her<br>belgian-ness and jewishness fed into her<br>films<br>I was influenced by the work of Richard<br>Dyer who is teaching at Warwick on<br>representation<br>and his argument that what is<br>significant is the author's material<br>social position in relation to discourse<br>the access to discourses they have on<br>account of who they are<br>following Daya I argued that ackerman's<br>four identities<br>allowed her access to a variety of<br>marginal positions<br>and her Cinema enacts that multiple<br>displacements which the sum of these<br>my supervisor at Warwick Jeanette van<br>sondo remains a role model for me on<br>many levels but particularly when it<br>comes to sharing one's privilege<br>alongside her expertise in French Cinema<br>and feminism and film Jeanette pulled me<br>over the threshold between student and<br>lecturer by providing me with my first<br>opportunities for teaching and<br>publication<br>she commissioned me to coordinate<br>multiple entries for a section on<br>Belgium for the Encyclopedia of European<br>Cinema and thereby gave me the excuse to<br>write more widely on this little known<br>area<br>I haven't quite finished with the thank<br>yous yet hence the space on the other<br>side so researching on both minority<br>Cinema and feminist filmmaking in my<br>early career period necessarily had to<br>take place outside of work hours since<br>it meant traveling beyond the UK<br>so now we come to the hidden familial<br>support networks or the invisible hands<br>that are what really create or support a<br>work-life balance<br>I could not have traveled for work<br>without the understanding of my husband<br>Martin and the enthusiastic support of<br>my in-laws cap and Jim Corbett and my<br>in the course of my research at film<br>archives in Brussels and Antwerp I came<br>across films by the Frenchman Alfred<br>Masha<br>in his films I found an illustration of<br>the complex relationship between Cinema<br>and the national as discursive terrains<br>of struggle between dominant and<br>non-dominant forces<br>the work I would undertake has<br>contributed to the study of the cinema<br>of small nations of which New Zealand is<br>included and sheds light on the<br>dovetailing and competition between<br>sub-national national International<br>transnational Regional and Global forces<br>in the sphere of Cinema<br>Alfred Marshall was sent by pathe to<br>Africa in 1907 to shoot footage of the<br>colonies<br>on returning after two Expeditions he<br>was then sent to Belgium to set up a<br>studio from 1911 to 14.<br>as well as news rules documentaries<br>features and Comic Shorts mashan had a<br>liking for animal films I'm coming to<br>that image<br>his star performer was a panther called<br>Mimi who he bought back from Africa with<br>him<br>he she featured in a film in which get<br>this she stole the famous mannequin p<br>statue<br>in this film and others mashan took<br>advantage of interest in Africa largely<br>due to the annexing of the Congo to<br>Belgium in 1908 followed by the Swift<br>death of Leopold II in 1909.<br>yeah what is interesting to note is that<br>mashan did not make propagandist films<br>instead their main effect lies elsewhere<br>in the context of an alternative film<br>history centering on looking<br>it's not so much the long take or single<br>shot that Masha makes use of a more a<br>thoughtful reframing of a scene that<br>introduces ambivalence<br>changing what we thought we were seeing<br>to something quite different<br>so what you see here is a frame and then<br>a clip from first of Allah<br>Uganda hunting a giraffe in Uganda<br>and a fiction Film LA Fida delft the<br>young girl from delft made in 1914 about<br>a young heroine who travels to the city<br>of Brussels where she makes her Fortune<br>as a ballet dancer before the cruelty of<br>fate intervenes and she's blinded in a<br>balloon accident<br>and has to come up has to give up her<br>passion and return home to her waiting<br>Suitor who she'd actually rejected<br>mashan made a number of films about<br>hunting in Africa all of which follow a<br>particular formula<br>hence in giraffe we follow a hunting<br>party as if from mashan or the<br>cameraman's point of view<br>we see a man shoot his gun then we cut<br>to the giraffe on the ground<br>meanwhile in the Philadelphia delft kite<br>and Jeff have made a windmill out of<br>flowers for a village competition on<br>winning the competition they celebrate<br>so that's what you see here by dancing<br>for an audience of children<br>in both these films the shot that<br>follows these two reframes the scenes<br>abruptly giving us a completely<br>different view upon them<br>in giraffe we cut to a wider framing in<br>which we see more natives sitting<br>watching this action<br>while in lafida delft once the dance is<br>over we cut backwards to see a man<br>emerging in the frame in fact you can<br>see him in the clip that's showing at<br>the moment whom the intertellers titles<br>tell us is a tourist in other words<br>someone from Brussels who asked to take<br>a photograph of the two children<br>so by reframing a scene in these two<br>different films mashan allows for<br>ambivalent positions<br>we go from the European explorer or<br>mashan's camera watching The Hunt to the<br>attentive point of view of the<br>encircling natives<br>in lafidadelf we go from the watchful<br>playful children complicit and part of<br>the ritual to the tourist who is a<br>stranger from Brussels<br>thus what I argued is that there's a<br>doubling of vision here which suggests<br>that mashan's films matter should come<br>Downton back to that question in a<br>social ideological sense<br>since they offer sites of contestation<br>for a Belgium which was undergoing an<br>identity crisis on a number of different<br>levels<br>the work on Belgian Cinema of which This<br>research on mass and forms a part led to<br>my compilation of the European Cinema<br>reader completed when I was working at<br>Southampton Institute of higher<br>education<br>I could not have asked for a better<br>first job<br>populated with like-minded colleagues<br>whose own scholarship has been highly<br>influential in the field of film and<br>media studies Deborah German Karen<br>Randall and Sean Redmond<br>this was the kind of workplace everyone<br>dreams of one emphatically without<br>hierarchy<br>where we could bring our whole selves to<br>work<br>in 2004 though responding to a job ad<br>for a post-teaching European cinema at<br>avant-garde film I found myself in<br>autoporti Dunedin greeted by Professor<br>Nicholson<br>in my first few years here I extended my<br>work on European and Belgian Cinemas<br>through an edited collection as Paula<br>mentioned examining the space of the<br>rural<br>co-edited with Jillian halfield who'd<br>also undertaken a PhD at Warwick and who<br>was a wonderful collaborator<br>The Collection was a way to focus on the<br>background settings of films rather than<br>the figures in the foreground<br>a way then to come back to that<br>fascination with the wind blowing in the<br>trees<br>in the collection we argued that whilst<br>the urban space in the cinema has been<br>endlessly represented and theorized once<br>it's displaced by the rural so our<br>understanding of Cinema's use of<br>modernity the national postcolonialism<br>I joined otago at a time when film<br>Scholars were lamenting the death of<br>Cinema after only a hundred years of<br>being in existence<br>as we'd known it for so long<br>films projected in movie theaters<br>due to the rise of digital production<br>DVDs at that point and then later<br>streaming services<br>whilst in the first 40 Years of his<br>existence film studies has been fixated<br>on the question what is Cinema<br>in the 2000s I joined many others in<br>responding to the question where is<br>Cinema<br>when it came to Eccentric Cinema<br>in its alternative form it could be<br>found in art galleries and museums at<br>International biennials and outside in<br>public spaces<br>however this evacuation from its home<br>appeared to leave it unmoored and outs<br>and experiencing a kind of identity<br>crisis<br>my research in this area has focused on<br>how this different space for viewing<br>allowed other forms of Engagement in<br>which Bart's pensiveness or<br>contemplation of the visual was the goal<br>and by and my developing interest in<br>visual culture has been greatly enriched<br>by conversations and collaborations with<br>for the last 20 years then I've been<br>increasingly readjusting to the new<br>conditions for viewing available in the<br>art world<br>and it's here that it seems appropriate<br>to also acknowledge with gratitude my<br>children Joe and Imo<br>whose Journeys through life since coming<br>to New Zealand have been enriched quite<br>dramatically by the Arts<br>intervening in the many Lively debates<br>about how to understand the evacuation<br>of artists from the movie theater I've<br>argued that film studies and art history<br>must join forces and I coined the term<br>Gallery film to encapsulate the<br>hybridity and exchange going on between<br>art and film<br>I found that paradoxically when movement<br>enters the art gallery<br>Stillness seems to invade the moving<br>image<br>when Stillness invades the moving image<br>any movement that is present forces us<br>to readjust our understanding of and<br>expectations for the image<br>so we really need to revisit here the<br>assertion that I made earlier that when<br>narratively disposed film language does<br>not have abstract and descriptive<br>qualities<br>instead in these examples in the art<br>gallery frequently artists moving<br>artists moving images resist our urge to<br>Define to sum them up<br>if we think of the dictionary definition<br>of Define to state or describe exactly<br>or to express completion or bring<br>something to an end<br>then we find that our engagement<br>with these images is quite different<br>this is because they ask us to stay with<br>them<br>and the example I want to show you here<br>is David Claire boots film Untitled<br>and if you can focus on the on the trees<br>it's the trees in the background again<br>that are important here<br>so this appears to be a photograph that<br>unfolds in time<br>but is not a film and a film that is<br>stilled in time but is not a photograph<br>on the one hand this video takes us back<br>to early moments in cinema extracting<br>the wind blowing in the Trees of baby's<br>dinner<br>yet on the other it develops a totally<br>new sense of time in the moving image<br>as you can see the visual qualities of<br>the image range from the opaque<br>abstraction of the window<br>through to the shimmering visibility of<br>the children<br>the fact that these different visual<br>tones are contained in one image will<br>make Bart very happy<br>not only can we add to it because we<br>have to take our time with it<br>it encourages a pensive attitude<br>remember he said we can't find<br>pensiveness in the moving image in other<br>words a temporal state of involvement<br>through which one might take time to<br>think allowing viewing to fall along a<br>spectrum of abstraction through<br>hopefully you've noticed how the edges<br>of the silhouette of the trees projected<br>onto the back wall can be seen to move<br>very subtly<br>it's easier to see when we're in the<br>room with it<br>as we can see in Claire Boots video<br>Stillness and the natural movement of<br>light create what we think what we might<br>think of as still moving images<br>that are perceptually as well as<br>technologically intense<br>these images want to involve us in our<br>disciplement and provide us with the<br>pleasure of perceiving them in their<br>becoming<br>these still moving images but are mostly<br>in a formal aesthetic sense to come back<br>to that mattering<br>because they Advance debates about<br>moving images outside the movie theater<br>in this and other examples there is the<br>capacity for significantly different<br>conditions for perception involvement<br>and pleasure in the image<br>equally artists are intent on creating<br>and so we arrive at part five<br>much shorter than the other three<br>the most recent period and it's time to<br>go back into the kitchen where Jan<br>continues to prepare venuschnitzel for<br>Hassan Sylvan who'll be home from school<br>any minute<br>in my interview with Kim Hill she points<br>out that I've spent almost 30 years<br>watching this film<br>I must say something about me I think<br>something good I hope<br>what has kept me coming back is<br>definitely the fact that there always<br>seems to be more that can be added<br>one reason for this is because of the<br>technological advances that have ensued<br>so what you're watching now is the<br>actual VHS image that I had to analyze<br>in my PhD<br>it looked like this it was<br>terrible<br>I had no idea then of the way in which<br>the lights hit the edges of the table I<br>couldn't make out the actual pattern of<br>the wallpaper or the curtains in the<br>background and it was impossible to<br>study the subtle changes in expression<br>in Delphin sarig's face which are really<br>important because they're indicative of<br>the various remasterings of John Dillman<br>have meant that the detail of the film<br>can now be studied accurately<br>but in addition across that span of time<br>by growing knowledge of Belden Cinema<br>rural filmmaking other women filmmakers<br>such as Sally Potter didn't even have<br>time to talk about her<br>and gallery films have provided me with<br>a deeper understanding a wider range of<br>examples of how Chantal ackerman's use<br>of her camera as a representational<br>in a world increasingly saturated with<br>images<br>unfortunately that sounds so much like<br>the opening of a student's essay but I'm<br>going to say anyway<br>I must have taken it on<br>in a world increasingly saturated with<br>images the visual rather than the<br>written word is a privileged locus of<br>exploration of the ethical<br>my scholarship began as I've told you by<br>exploring how looking in cinema is never<br>innocent or neutral<br>but always complicit and thus ethically<br>implicated<br>and as John Dillman hopefully finds new<br>audiences maybe even some in this room<br>I continue to look closely at those<br>eccentric films that actively foreground<br>and investigate the process through<br>which agency and responsibility are<br>ascribed to viewers<br>thank you<br>um so as the pro Vice Chancellor of<br>humanities which is the division in<br>which Catherine works it's my great<br>pleasure to present a vote of thanks to<br>her and a couple of comments on on her<br>lecture<br>um Catherine began by talking about her<br>job or perhaps her calling is being to<br>draw our attention to things that might<br>appear insignificant to the common or<br>uninformed eye<br>and I can certainly say you did that<br>very well tonight Catherine thank you<br>you talked about the humanities scholar<br>revealing ways of interpreting and<br>consuming the world observing the what<br>and the how and drawing questions and<br>conclusions about this world we inhabit<br>in this world that we create<br>Catherine you gave a beautifully<br>constructed in your professorial lecture<br>and you delivered it with ease and class<br>that is something that we observed a<br>master at work and in so doing you<br>invited us to make observations and to<br>ask questions of the world around us and<br>at one point um<br>uh the the deputywise chancellor<br>research who I happen to be sitting with<br>tonight Professor Richard Blakey leaned<br>over to me so I apologize that it might<br>have been a bit rude but it was because<br>he was drawing an observation out from<br>what you were saying so it was at the<br>point in the lecture when you were<br>sharing the um the 1895 baby's dinner<br>film and talking about the beginning of<br>moving images and Richard leaned over<br>and he said<br>isn't it interesting or you said it very<br>very briefly but I'm expanding isn't it<br>interesting that we've come full circle<br>with the now endless self-published<br>observations of everyday life that we<br>see on Tick Tock<br>and I thought in response I'm only glad<br>that my teenage daughters are not here<br>too to hear me affirm the value of tick<br>tock<br>perhaps I can accept their value as a<br>form of Aesthetics as Professor Fowler<br>pointed out but not as a source of<br>Social and ideological value<br>then I thought to myself a bit further<br>in the lecture that when I'm confronted<br>with the tick tock and YouTube clips<br>that my children seem to be absorbed by<br>I have learned from tonight's lecture<br>that I must tell myself to look for the<br>trees in the clips<br>so Catherine thank you you spoke of<br>privilege<br>and it's our privilege and I mean that<br>in terms of gratitude and good fortune<br>that you chose to come and to stay at<br>otago thank you for your collaboration<br>with other staff here it was lovely to<br>hear from Professor volci on that and<br>thank you too for your celebration and<br>affirmation of the Arts we need to hear<br>that and we need to hear your work<br>a<br>I have the great pleasure of presenting<br>to you a small gift that is a sign of<br>our appreciation for this evening<br>and to our audience those who are here<br>with me and those who might be online<br>watching thank you so much for<br>participating in this evening thank you<br>for those of you who are here for coming<br>out<br>it's our tradition now to head over to<br>the staff club and join Catherine and<br>her family for a drink and for some food<br>and to congratulate her on both a very<br>impressive achievement of making to<br>professor and a superb lecture so thank<br>you good night</p></main><footer
