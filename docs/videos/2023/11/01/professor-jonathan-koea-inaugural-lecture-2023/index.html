those through the<br>evening through our colleagues and some<br>of your<br>bosses um<br>and as I read the article that came out<br>to today that um in the University news<br>that it was in 1982 that you started<br>your journey as a mass student um in the<br>University one of<br>six um I just after the springb tour and<br>you will have heard where I come from um<br>um uh it's an interesting juter position<br>of events um and a journey that aloa has<br>been over on over that<br>time with new twists and turns coming<br>October 15 I believe um um but we'll<br>leave that for tonight um uh to be<br>considered a professor at this<br>institution is no mean<br>feet um it takes a small Forest to just<br>do the paperwork um leave alone all the<br>Publications<br>um um that Jonathan has achieved leave<br>alone the manner he holds amongst all of<br>his colleagues um and in fact I was just<br>thinking that if there's any surgical<br>emergencies in Tamaki makota tonight<br>we're in trouble because you're all<br>sitting in here but that's um um the<br>Mone in which you held by your<br>colleagues um Jonathan<br>so this is a great occasion of<br>Celebration a chance for you to Showcase<br>to Foo um to your colleagues about all<br>that you've done what you've achieved<br>and for us to celebrate<br>together um on behalf of our Dean<br>professor John Fraser he wanted to<br>congratulate you I congratulate you and<br>behalf of our faculty we congratulate<br>you so uh we're looking forward to<br>hearing from you but first um Professor<br>Richard Douglas is going to introduce<br>Richard uh thank you<br>Dean I would like to begin by<br>acknowledging and<br>welcoming Jonathan's mother Shona um his<br>wife Lisa Jane and his two children who<br>could be here tonight WAMU and honor now<br>he has two other daughters uh India and<br>Liberty and unfortunately because of<br>commitments to their uh studies in<br>Wellington they can't be here<br>tonight without the love and support of<br>asano we would not be here tonight<br>celebrating uh Jonathan's Stella<br>surgical career<br>now it is my very great honor and<br>privilege to introduce Professor<br>Jonathan coer on the uh occasion of his<br>inaugural<br>lecture we met some time ago in the 19<br>late<br>1980s as uh surgical research fellows in<br>department of<br>surgery um we had no idea of the<br>adventures that lay before us which is<br>po possibly just as well<br>um Jonathan went on to finish with<br>greater Plum his uh time as a research<br>fellow he then went off to train in<br>general surgery in AO New<br>Zealand and in<br>1997 he was uh he became a fellow of the<br>royal austral Asian College of<br>Surgeons now he and his young family<br>then went to New<br>York and the reason for that was that<br>Jonathan had been awarded a highly<br>prestigious Fellowship in Surgical<br>Oncology at Memorial SL kering and he<br>spent the next two years there being<br>trained by some of the best surgeons in<br>the world and I know that this is this<br>is a particularly seminal period in in<br>his development as an academic surgeon I<br>know we're going to hear a bit more<br>about this<br>shortly he then returned to New Zealand<br>and he took up a position at ockland<br>hospital as a general and a paob<br>surgeon and from 2005 to<br>2010 he was the chief of upperi and HPB<br>surgery at<br>Oakland in 2011 he accepted a position<br>at NorthShore Hospital he's been there<br>ever since and he's currently the chief<br>of upper GI and hbb surgery there and<br>he's also the clinical leader of cancer<br>services for white<br>matar now I see there are actually quite<br>a few of his colleagues here tonight uh<br>and they will attest to<br>Jonathan's excellent clinical judgment<br>and that he performs his surgery with<br>great technical<br>skill and I know that there are some of<br>his students and some of his trainees<br>here and they they know Jonathan is a<br>natural<br>teacher and he inspires him with his<br>knowledge and with his<br>compassion and I know that whose<br>patients love him they respect him and<br>him now there is<br>more he is the he's a editor of the<br>Australian New Zealand Journal of<br>surgery he is a president elect of the<br>Australia and IO New Zealand aob bilary<br>Association he<br>is<br>impressive that one slips my mind but he<br>is also a<br>trustee of uh of he auru<br>moai thank you and he is an advisor to<br>tahu<br>Oahu so as you can see he's a man of<br>very many parts and obviously of<br>enormous<br>energy he is also the first Mari<br>professor of surgery to be appointed to<br>the department of surgery to be<br>appointed to the<br>university his professorship is divided<br>between the department of<br>surgery and Teena ha<br>Mari as such he is a special<br>inspiration to our Mari graduates and<br>many of them seek his advice absolutely<br>all I think uh receive his inspiration<br>and<br>encouragement and I think that perhaps<br>the best encouragement that he can<br>example now Jonathan was was uh<br>genetically programmed to write because<br>his dad was a journalist and his mother<br>Shona is an acclaimed author and so he<br>has published more than<br>170 period reviewed papers as well as<br>book<br>chapters as well as a number of really<br>perceptive<br>commentaries and I have<br>one what I'd like to do to finish is I'd<br>like to read the concluding<br>sentences from a an editorial that<br>Jonathan wrote in the New Zealand<br>medical<br>journal he<br>writes the editorial is entitled a time<br>for rang<br>Tanga rang Tanga guides a philosophy of<br>bringing people together learning from<br>one another sharing wisdom and building<br>Mana this form of leadership Embraces<br>collectivism nurturing<br>relationships reciprocity and a system<br>of interdependent leadership that<br>accounts for the common goals of all<br>people rang tianga can be described as<br>an ad mixture of servant<br>leadership where leaders do so with<br>humility and Empower<br>others and ethical leadership where<br>leaders exemplify actions that are<br>driven by moral and ethical values and<br>admonish actions that are<br>not Jonathan you live by your words<br>congratulations my friend and I look<br>lecture<br>A2<br>oku uh H uh Richard Philip Philipa<br>papang War<br>um<br>Manar<br>tya<br>OK George<br>K<br>uhar<br>Jonathan<br>so I had great concerns Richard told me<br>that this has to be about me which I<br>hate it's the least interesting topic um<br>and I'm bad at talking about that but I<br>thought I'd talk about we all live in<br>Two Worlds and I think particularly Mari<br>and the too and the and the audience<br>will understand that um yeah we do live<br>in Two Worlds and we have to balance<br>those and also as a surgeon there's the<br>world of research and the world of<br>teaching and the world of surgery but um<br>this is I like starting with a<br>fium to Coro Mor AKA so I think this is<br>from taranaki but essentially the kuma<br>does not say how sweet he<br>is um like most of RA it's hard to know<br>is that a statement or an observation or<br>or a a directive I like this Samuel<br>Johnson said this all censure of a of<br>oneself as oblique praise to show how<br>much he can<br>spare um and then I found this PO uh<br>nearly 200 years ago actually predicted<br>the internet notice that various people<br>with the affectation of praiseworthy<br>sentiments it's not the only way of<br>covering up reprehensible ones but a<br>more upto-date method is to put these<br>letter on exhibition so that one at<br>and then Samuel Becket I wonder if I'm<br>not yet again talking about myself and<br>shall I be incapable or really of lying<br>on any other<br>subject and for any surgical fellows in<br>the audience I quote this more and more<br>an old man remembers everything but<br>forgets that he told you so for all of<br>the registrars have had to listen<br>through those stories many many times<br>and Nod and laugh at the right time I<br>thank<br>you we should start at the beginning so<br>as Richard said um we were a a family of<br>writers that's my father and my mother<br>um about mid-70s in a place in TPO where<br>we used to go on holiday um it's fair to<br>say that the the tooya woman um are not<br>pleased at probably having photos uh<br>projected but I've deliberately<br>subjected them I selected them I think<br>that they're they're complimentry<br>there's not many um and if there's<br>anyone who looks silly in photos you'll<br>find that it's me<br>anyway I was very blessed by two parents<br>who were thoughtful and and considerate<br>and we were a house full of books um<br>reading and knowledge was valued and of<br>course two journalists it was expected<br>that you read the newspaper each day and<br>were were up to date with things um so<br>my father was was interesting and as one<br>does with one's father one thinks a<br>great deal about that that's his parents<br>that's toot George Kya um and Isabelle<br>uh sometime probably in the early 30s he<br>was born just before the depression he's<br>the oldest um that's marama who was the<br>the middle child people of a of a<br>certain age will remember Mara Martin<br>from TV in the weather um she's the<br>famous uh branch of the family and<br>that's the three children so and then in<br>the middle is the youngest Moana she's<br>still alive in her 90s is was the first<br>Mar<br>physiotherapist the interesting thing<br>which I thought was unique to our family<br>but actually it wasn't was my<br>grandparents spoke to AA fluently um but<br>did not pass it on to their children and<br>would not pass it on and would not teach<br>any of us um which was a phenomenon of<br>the times it's quite quite widespread<br>and I've been through various stages of<br>kind of trying to understand that but I<br>think my grandfather was offed at paraka<br>at the age of five his father died of<br>tuberculosis and is buried there along<br>with his mother so he was an only child<br>um orphaned at at the age of five and I<br>suspect many of his decisions were made<br>for survival um and of course we're all<br>here so um was probably right that's my<br>great-grandfather that's tooya tooya<br>mcache that's where our family name<br>comes from it's my grandfather's father<br>I I found<br>this um image I still can't I get quite<br>emotional I found it earlier this year<br>I've never seen him<br>before um and so it's lovely to have<br>that image you can kind of see the light<br>I think um and you know I think if he<br>hadn't died the trajectory of our family<br>would have been<br>different that's his father T um he was<br>born in the chattam islands for reasons<br>that we'll go through in a a little<br>minute um and was responsible for<br>bringing Nati muta and Niti Tama back<br>from the chadam islands to to Northern<br>taranaki too's older brother to Caper<br>that's him in the middle he became sort<br>of the leader of the family that's a<br>picture it's in poo I which is the<br>tanaki museum um has hand has left hands<br>on the anchorstone repeatedly of the<br>tokomaru canoe and just on the table to<br>his right is Nai which is the edge that<br>was supposedly legendary made to used to<br>to make the canoe and it was uh that<br>those items were kept on family land<br>safe um and then donated to to the<br>museum they're still allowed out they're<br>not given they and that's one of the<br>tutor boys uh about 18 months ago with<br>Nai um at a particularly important uh<br>occasion where we signed a a a um<br>contract with Waka<br>kaii so that's Fitzroy School in the<br>1930s dad's sort of in the middle just<br>uh off to the left hand side you can you<br>can see him there so um nor many Mar's<br>in that class so um they lived in town<br>he became a prefect at New Plymouth boys<br>High School there's bound to be someone<br>here from there great all black Factory<br>um so that's him on the bottom bottom<br>right as you see it and then he became a<br>journalist um he looked at being a um in<br>the Air Force but his eyes went good<br>enough where where all my OPAC and and<br>my family um the thing on the desk for<br>the younger people was a typewriter that<br>that's that's a very early form of a<br>laptop<br>um and uh he he did some cool things<br>though he was the F his newspaper was<br>the first to bring in computerized type<br>rather than hot Le type um he won a<br>mobile award for if you go to New<br>Plymouth there's a clock tower build in<br>the main street he he did a Telethon for<br>that and that's the Communist photo you<br>see he didn't have newspapers behind him<br>um it was a posed photo but that's often<br>the one that that gets shown of him so<br>he had quite a a spectacular career and<br>so did his siblings um as<br>well that's my mom's family that's sort<br>of one of the few that we have and the<br>best they were Irish immigrants that's<br>my grandmother on the the knee of the<br>chap in the Middle with her parents on<br>the side they were tough resilient<br>people um came from Ireland early early<br>in the 20th century as many did due to<br>circumstances worked as Farm laborers<br>saved up and bought Farms good<br>people so that's me early on that photo<br>somewhere on the internet I don't know<br>how it got there but there you go um<br>still got that trike like that I was<br>very interested in the natural world<br>it's taken at Taran museum at one point<br>um and then that Central School<br>influence infants year two Prim two I<br>think they used to call it um where are<br>we there that's me there that's my best<br>friend Edward the theory behind me Eddie<br>was fun to hang out he's really cool um<br>people often ask me what my first<br>experience of racism was I think it was<br>here and it was a gentle sort but it was<br>nonetheless and M and I've talked about<br>this at the beginning of every year I'd<br>end up in the kind of bottom class you<br>know the bottom group cuz they streamed<br>in um with other kids who were like<br>heaps of fun and then about a year about<br>a month in these multi-choice tests that<br>come around and you do maths and english<br>comprehension and things and then I'd<br>get put up to another class another<br>group with other kids that weren't so<br>much fun but it happened every year and<br>it was just you know as a kid you didn't<br>know you just sort of thought okay there<br>you go um so then I ended up here this<br>is Francis Douglas college and you can<br>see the mountain very much a part of<br>life in tanaki um it was nowhere near as<br>as as big as this um but it was a great<br>place I'm not Roman Catholic but I was<br>taught by Roman Catholic Brothers the<br>Dell brothers and they instilled into us<br>that sense of vocation rather than<br>career so we're already looking at you<br>know what are we going to do with our<br>lives as opposed to what job are we<br>going to do and there is a subtle<br>difference I think that's I can't find<br>the third form photo but that's the the<br>that's the fourth form photo which is<br>what year eight I think there's me um<br>quite shy uh not quite sure of myself um<br>this is Andrew Wiggins here who was a<br>friend of mine at school and he'll he'll<br>appear again<br>soon so it was a great place to grow we<br>used to talk you know you could climb on<br>on Mount Egmont that's us there um and<br>you could go surfing that's surfing at<br>the kumra<br>patch um but of course it wasn't and we<br>were very all of us were aware that<br>there was there was something underneath<br>that was a fantastic place to grow up<br>but there was something sort of unspoken<br>different um sometimes in the way that<br>people acted sometimes in the parts of<br>town that they lived in um and of course<br>it was sort of all around us really when<br>I look back this is 23 Gilbert street<br>directly across the street from where we<br>used to live at 22 um it's a different<br>neighborhood now uh it was nice but um<br>Porsche kayn hadn't been invented there<br>this was taken last year um this was<br>tinier Allison's house every house in<br>Gilbert Street had that little setback<br>on the fence the little the were Gardens<br>in front and these people tried to buy<br>that off the council but of course that<br>land had all been confiscated by Mari<br>and and then Mar the local Mari quite<br>rightly said what but you can't sell it<br>it's not yours um so yeah everywhere<br>where we lived um there was all this<br>there was this deep history it's the<br>famous wood um wood cutter Dicky Barrett<br>who was a wher Dicky Barrett's hotel in<br>Wellington anyone from poni um it's<br>about the only picture of him he's he's<br>buried at namu beach in New Plymouth but<br>he was there in the 1830s so 10 years<br>before to TTI and he had that to say<br>about um a very long battle a months a<br>monthl long battle between the W who<br>came down who were our traditional<br>enemies in Mari and um it went on for a<br>month hand-to-hand combat um quite quite<br>Savage uh and that's you know rary<br>Hondas talked about this that before the<br>land Wars we had the W Wars with uh<br>taranim<br>Mari that's a very old picture taken um<br>to the South oh this is now Port<br>taranaki here you can see some ships<br>this is mkah which was a big rock it's<br>not there anymore it was um was uh<br>demolished and used for fill to build<br>Wares but that became a Mari Fortress uh<br>and a lot of Mari left the area went to<br>Wellington first and then the chadam<br>islands um T's grandparents amongst them<br>and those that left um basically stayed<br>on Mahi so even 5 years later there were<br>very few Mari and taranaki and it's had<br>very important implications for the<br>wangy tribunal because there's a thing<br>called the 1840 rule if you were in an<br>occupation of your land in 1840 makes it<br>quite difficult to um to have a claim<br>and those things are still<br>ongoing the other thing in town there<br>was Marland Hill which was actually<br>pukaki um there was a a mar a fortified<br>Mar P that was leveled in Barracks were<br>put on it um couldn't find a really good<br>photo but I found this map so this we're<br>now 20 years later in the land Wars and<br>so this is the uh the the the British<br>army had uh encampment on top of it<br>quite significant and when uh when they<br>were due to parade they'd run down a a<br>zigzag track cut on the side of the Hill<br>called the zigzag and typical tanaki way<br>uh through Red Coat Lane which is this<br>thing here and then this is them running<br>right up there to parade on this ground<br>which was my school playground otherwise<br>known as poverty flat so that's a house<br>there um and so all of this was all<br>around me when I was growing up but it<br>we didn't really know about it so it's a<br>it's a deep um and interesting<br>history well that's me um I told you the<br>photos that make me look silly this is<br>my oscar Goldman phase I think if you<br>remember the $6 Million Man rowing on<br>late Tapo I love sport I wasn't good<br>good at it but I loved<br>it that's us in the seventh form um you<br>can see Adel brother there we where am I<br>that's me I'm a bit happier now we had a<br>big seventh form that year and I don't<br>know why um but we did it was good this<br>guy here is Richard Shaw he will he will<br>appear again soon like lots of people<br>had two great teachers at school and<br>this was a school where rugby and<br>agriculture were were those were the<br>main subjects a lot of the boys came and<br>as soon as they finished they went home<br>to run the Family Farm studying for 40<br>minutes a night was viewed as Overkill<br>really um so it it's hard to get into<br>medical school from that but I had<br>Barbara McDonald and John riddle both<br>University academics I don't know what<br>they were doing uh working in a boy<br>School in taranaki but anyway they took<br>me under their wing and I went I went<br>back there about a month two months ago<br>so that room there on a<br>Saturday I would sit in there and do<br>mock buery exams which they would then<br>go through with me so they managed to<br>drag my marks up um and I managed to win<br>a prize it's a George home prize the<br>first thing I ever won George home was a<br>GP<br>in New Plymouth and he'll appear a<br>little bit later as well so that was<br>nice so I came here for an interview um<br>by this nice man some of you will know<br>Colin alive and and very happy in<br>wanica and got in on the mest program I<br>think I probably had the lowest Mark I<br>think 304 for abury which is pretty<br>terrible but anyway there we are ands<br>more importantly um this is the old oal<br>call what was known as the volleyball<br>cour<br>the new oo Hall is a series of high<br>risers this was a series of<br>semi-abandoned private hotels and and<br>and hospitals um so there I'm there and<br>it was fun and I made some friends um<br>that's Brandon or Walker who may or may<br>not be here said he was going to<br>come oh there is my best man um and<br>probably more than anyone um got me<br>through medical school I think showed me<br>how to study showed me how to sort of<br>start thinking about EX<br>questions um and this lady here married<br>me a little bit later on from that<br>so it's fair to say that medical school<br>wasn't I wasn't it was hard you know<br>lots of information lots of study I<br>didn't know how to study didn't how to<br>organize it and it was not particularly<br>guy um Colton Gades came and gave the<br>Rob lectures in two 1983 series of three<br>lectures over three weeks we all went to<br>it he's much discredited now and you'll<br>have to Google him to find out why but<br>he um went to New Guinea in in the 1950s<br>to study a disease called Kuru which was<br>a very dementing um disease that was<br>being transmitted vertically through<br>families um it was the first recognition<br>of a slow Virus Infection what we know<br>now you know is mad cow disease or<br>similar but what was wonderful was how<br>he was able to use his medical knowledge<br>to kind of dissect a situation that was<br>very chaotic in a very difficult<br>environment and that was quite um<br>inspiring and so that's even though I<br>wasn't very cever I started thinking<br>about research because that was<br>interesting you know how can you solve<br>real world<br>problems so after a slightly better<br>third year these two folks took me under<br>their wing un sadly no longer with us<br>Mary Bolan um she was a renal<br>physiologist tremendously kind Paul Hill<br>um who was a respiratory physiologist<br>head of the Department of physiology<br>also very kind um they took a not very<br>promising student into the department um<br>and taught me research so I did a<br>one-year research<br>degree I told her there be some Dreadful<br>photos of me this is me and my Richard<br>iadi phase I think um and I put this up<br>for the for toera so this is um we<br>graduated with a bachelor of human<br>biology um and<br>me being me I decided I didn't want to<br>graduate because I hate ceremony and I<br>don't like being in front of and I don't<br>like anyway you get the point um and<br>then the next year my father died and<br>it's haunted me ever since that I would<br>have meant so much to him I think to see<br>his son graduate so I've graduated every<br>other time and you all should too cuz<br>it's not about you it's about your<br>family and the people who put you there<br>so this date's important I can pinpoint<br>to the hour when I first wrote something<br>that actually fitted the bill and it was<br>February 16 1986 and I know that because<br>that's when the Mel lenov sank in the<br>Tory Channel or Queen Charlotte sound um<br>because the deadline for me to present<br>Mary with a copy of my thesis was<br>February the 17th 1986 and of course I<br>wasn't good at manage well I didn't<br>manage deadlines then so I sat down to<br>write that night we didn't have a TV and<br>I listened to the radio all night and I<br>actually turned out a draft that was not<br>perfect but it wasn't too bad so<br>February the 16th 1986 it's the first<br>time I wrote anything that was probably<br>any good or did what it's supposed to<br>do clinical years um three kind of<br>interesting figures Tim colmer<br>polarizing figure but worked um as a as<br>a pathologist used to teach in the oian<br>fashion um in the mor and show and show<br>show will teach the macroscopic<br>manifestations of disease coupled with<br>history and examination finding so it<br>was quite an interesting way of doing<br>them this chat um that's a very young<br>Jim Shaw who had uh returned to New<br>Zealand in 1986 from uh from SL kering<br>from New York after I'd finished my work<br>with Mary I did a summer student ship<br>with Jim no one else would really take<br>me but he was just starting to get going<br>and um as what should will say he took<br>anybody at that time um and I'm<br>tremendously grateful for that and then<br>there was this guy so this is u p um eru<br>was the only Mari I had visibility of in<br>medson who was a<br>proceduralist who kind of did research<br>and did other stuff and I kind of knew<br>that that's the direction I was in and<br>yet how do you leave one World Behind to<br>go into another and I he took me to<br>lunch in Wellington which was incredibly<br>kind of him and we had a long talk and<br>his his advice was you know you just<br>have to do it and um when it is time<br>people will come and find you and and<br>ensure that you are skilled um because<br>it's very difficult to balance it's very<br>difficult to move in one world and keep<br>moving in the other um and so that was<br>very reassuring and his words have<br>actually proved to be true I've not been<br>a good pupil but they proved to be<br>true so you can imagine that um going to<br>the m every day you couldn't actually<br>talk about there so we had a code and it<br>was the Laura Ashley shop for those<br>Laura Ashley was a decorator and sort of<br>Home wear's person and seem to be as far<br>away from the M as well so most days we<br>go to the lur Ashley shop and then we'd<br>go to the philson library this is the<br>old philson and these are the stacks<br>that are in the basement and so we had<br>quite a self-directed learning<br>program I read every one of Richard<br>doll's original papers to see whether<br>really smoking did cause cancer and it<br>did so that was useful but that really<br>said a real solid foundation of<br>knowledge um but it took a long time and<br>of course you're often out of step with<br>exams the other thing I was doing as<br>sort of working parttime for Jim sure<br>Jim would and Richard all remember this<br>would be doing infusional studies where<br>we had to take tissue intraoperatively<br>and then measure metabolic markers so<br>about late morning I'd run over to<br>theater pick up the tissue I I wasn't an<br>anyway expert but I was the goer go to<br>the lab on the fifth floor and help<br>Analyze That<br>um and then rinse and repeat so that was<br>kind of fifth year um it was an<br>interesting time and you can see I was<br>clearly out in my own world my different<br>world it gave rise to this this<br>paper excuse me um Richard didn't want<br>me to put any research in here but this<br>was my sole contribution this graph<br>drawn on graph paper there was no<br>computers but what it showed is that a a<br>prim primary cancer a cancer that spread<br>to lymph nodes and then a cancer that<br>spread someplace else they're<br>metabolically more aggressive as you go<br>along that timeline which is true we<br>know that now but there was the first<br>influence of that and its real claim to<br>fame was there was this thing that if<br>you fed a patient intravenously when<br>they had cancer you would feed the<br>cancer um this was the data the whole<br>body data that showed actually it didn't<br>seem if you feed a patient it didn't<br>seem to affect the cancer but you did<br>feed the patient subsequent Trials of<br>shown that to be true at night I was<br>also doing some sort of Moonlighting<br>following regist and house suent around<br>and one night I found my old mate um<br>Andrew Wiggins uh who had leukemia an<br>extremist with neutropenic Inc colitis<br>that's a old an old condition now it's<br>managed with gcsf but if your white cell<br>count fell too low um your bell<br>perforated and so that was Andrew but<br>anyway we developed a new way of<br>treating that so so that that was good<br>um that's me uh Colin Maiden I managed<br>to graduate and get out of medical<br>school um same jacket I think just<br>noticed that from three years<br>ago um and then a little bit of house Su<br>in work and then I met these guys and<br>you know you already know Richard the<br>other two um Larger than Life characters<br>sadly no longer with us um Dave hstone<br>with with the blue shirt um and Matt<br>Matt Wild boore and the white shirt<br>and they were exactly as you see them<br>and there was a little packet of siggies<br>down there and an ashtray<br>so Dave Hammerstein particularly his<br>catchphrase was get real pal um if You'<br>done something dumb said something<br>stupid or hadn't done enough work and I<br>still he Dave in my head even now I miss<br>him miss him every<br>day um and then I decided to do an MD<br>this this person Peter everybody knows<br>Peter um huge influence on this medical<br>school that's Jim um at his<br>retirement um and then that's me<br>graduating so I to wear a floppy hat at<br>that time and I thought today I haven't<br>worn these robes since<br>then my wife um my mother and Auntie<br>Donnie excuse me we found out my father<br>had a half sister who was brought up at<br>fuaa and then lives um lived at ohayo so<br>she married into too apanui<br>so yep to mat slightly slightly<br>associated with that um she married a<br>namoki and she'll appears that all that<br>that's quite significant that all happen<br>again soon this is I think the paper at<br>the time I was most pleased with it<br>didn't make my MD but I was using<br>isotopically labeled water to get a<br>sense for what energy expenditure was<br>and a group of people who are really<br>sick or a group of people who are on<br>home feeding at home and basically this<br>graphs is sort of under mine<br>underpinned um tpn prescribing for 20<br>years so I think we got that right um it<br>involved collecting urine speci<br>specimens every day for for 12 days at<br>various um various locations around the<br>country but we got there it was good um<br>and then I started surgical training so<br>um that's me on the steps of the<br>building in melbour the college will<br>sell to pay off the debt I guess um<br>there was just me um and I did some runs<br>this is me and the wakeo so some of<br>those people are still friends today<br>Andrew Hill uh Chris holdway uh Ross<br>bl's retired Jenny still runs the<br>theaters um and then era was dead by<br>this time but as sort of as a last gift<br>I guess uh the HRC awarded me his<br>scholarship<br>the um Fellowship to travel to New York<br>and do some research and so this is the<br>first time I spoke on my Mariah at um um<br>urui some tip in the back new jacket um<br>but about to about to head overseas and<br>uh This Is Us and in New York we had two<br>children at that time whatam Mo little<br>and asleep and I always thought India<br>was too but when I looked at this photo<br>she's there's a little nose there and<br>there's two little eyes like looking<br>over the top of the glasses at the<br>photographer she must have been not<br>happy she's giving them the<br>Bey anyway you go overseas to work with<br>Giants and I went overseas to work with<br>Giants and I got to make some fabulous<br>friends so maray Brennan nowu maray you<br>know um we gave him a Christmas present<br>this was the year that the the<br>Highlanders were run her up in the Super<br>12 they didn't win it but rich sherock<br>now uh chair in Denver a friend um Ron<br>Chamberlain uh chair in New York uh<br>David<br>uh uh David Lan who's a chair in<br>Rochester uh Ronda Mato chair at pen um<br>ha P car chair in Barcelona um that's<br>Steve hawal he's at Roswell Park and<br>that's Joe isbat he's um where's where's<br>Joe he's Rhode Island and that's Andy<br>Smith who's um in Toronto so these<br>people they actually become your friends<br>and the families become your family's<br>friend as well and at this graduation so<br>we were lot kind of serious and um<br>that's me now in my Chino phase that's<br>joining the liver service that's Liz<br>bmar Liz and were as Richard said were<br>huge uh influences on me both Giants in<br>the field maray had operated on Mother<br>Theresa and various people and you know<br>worked in the department where<br>um uh Eva Pon was looked after in her<br>final illness Liz was a dentist um from<br>South Africa who basically became a<br>leader in liver surgery so for students<br>um I may well ask you one day named two<br>liver surgeons who started off as<br>dentists Les blooms one answer um bill<br>jigan was new in the department he's<br>become a lifelong friend there's uh Ron<br>he joined the Department human Fong left<br>for um city of hope not long after so<br>that was a fabulous time and um this<br>kind the sums up we go overseas I was<br>very lucky to work with these guys at<br>the peak of their career and um they<br>demonstrated to me the importance of<br>research leadership and how to build<br>good teams which is key really got to do<br>that I just want to put this in so this<br>is one thing I did in in New York am I<br>okay<br>for um it was the beginning of<br>laproscopic colonic surgery so there was<br>a a well thought to be a flare in wound<br>implants in the port sites from<br>aerosolized cancer cells but no one knew<br>what the denominator was so we had um we<br>had about 20,000 coloral cancers on the<br>institutional database and there's<br>definitely selection here but we could<br>prove that it was actually really it was<br>a really rare thing thing uh wasn't a<br>big thing um and later trials proved<br>that to be the case it wasn't more<br>common unless you ruptured the tumor and<br>would didn't put it in a bag so um I<br>also got to work with Alfred Cohen I I<br>can't find a photo of him but he was a<br>remarkable colorl surgeon um spent half<br>the year in Africa and half the year in<br>New York uh great leader went to<br>Kentucky after after SLO so then I came<br>back there's a much younger me and where<br>have you go particularly the students<br>when you're working you'll find my<br>patients find you and that's a lovely<br>thing um that's part of the<br>responsibility that's a guy called<br>Charlie hurri hanganu who had a um had<br>an<br>HCC and there's Al the operating as well<br>you know but this is much harder than<br>that I can tell you um and this is<br>probably more important in some ways<br>than<br>that so I was able to pay some debts<br>George H was in fact Royal austral Asian<br>College of fellow 169 he was the surgeon<br>in pluma the first proper surgeon they<br>had and also Viv sorl who was another um<br>who's from middlemore another early boss<br>of mine he had performed the first liver<br>reection um in in New Zealand I think<br>for coloral cancer that patient was<br>still alive 26 years later and so there<br>was a picture taken in our back garden<br>and it was lovely to acknowledge V in<br>that way for those who have worked at<br>middlemore the soral officer team was a<br>legendary team um and they had a great<br>Dynamic Neil wrote to me afterwards and<br>pointed out that although Viva done the<br>first liver section he' done the first<br>take back cuz he had to take the patient<br>back later that night<br>so I love them both they were<br>great and then a bit later on um this is<br>a first time I've done a multi- center<br>randomized trial looking at a at at a at<br>a hematic mechanism and it all started<br>with a my phone going from someone in a<br>taxi in in London um but there were oh<br>goodness me I think there were 18<br>centers right throughout the world and<br>it was it was a real challenge to learn<br>how to coordinate that collect the data<br>maintain the data Integrity um but we<br>were able to do that and we actually did<br>that five times and it was a product<br>that that's gone on at least in the US<br>to be very effective in in surface<br>hemostasis um now some of these people<br>are here today<br>so in about 2009 my phone went and um<br>this lady Diana who's right in the<br>middle um now known to many of you uh as<br>the Director general of Health called me<br>and said would I consider joining this<br>group we didn't even have I don't think<br>we had a name them the C3 group um but<br>we knew we're going to look at<br>comorbidity and cancer and so at that<br>point I was sort of running out of<br>research ideas and felt you know a<br>little bit uh a little bit empty really<br>but it's proved to be an enduring and a<br>fabulous um fabulous partnership and you<br>can see all of the people here this is<br>most of them um that's a very young<br>Jason goury who's also in the middle<br>Jason's um I think he thinks I might be<br>his mentor but he's actually my mentor<br>um uh and then uh James Stanley who's<br>probably the most brilliant statistician<br>I've even met I think uh Nina Scott<br>who's on huru moai Doug Campbell um<br>Doug's also here um he won't mind me<br>saying I think Doug's a mathematical<br>Sant because he can put a patient to<br>sleep and then he'll quite happily s<br>solving quadratic equations or calculus<br>um and for someone who's terrible at<br>maths uh it's phenomenal um I'm an a of<br>that Doug it's absolutely<br>amazing so this is where my worlds<br>really started to collide and I won't<br>kind<br>of bore you with the data but suffice to<br>say that Jason and his team with me and<br>Cahoots was able to show that forari and<br>suery and I think as suan would always s<br>ah you know endocrinologists<br>cardiologists you know those issues of<br>disparity they don't affect us um but<br>actually they do so the the mortality<br>rate for Mari after almost every<br>elective operation you want to choose is<br>significantly higher than for<br>non-mar interestingly it's still higher<br>for acute operations but the gap is<br>narrower which kind of suggests there's<br>actually something wrong with the system<br>and so that was really the end result of<br>using big data for a very long time uh<br>to kind of look at at Health outcomes<br>and a lot of this data although it's<br>only we couldn't get it published<br>overseas because really is it I don't<br>know um I would like to think we could<br>have but um it's in the New Zealand<br>medical journal but I think to a large<br>degree it's a driven policy for the<br>current government and<br>essentially what we were able to show is<br>that you know Mario was significantly<br>more likely to die after any procedure<br>that you want you want to name um<br>elective the the disparities more common<br>with elective rather than acute which is<br>kind of concerning more likely to<br>experience favor failure to rescue so<br>that's where you know if you get into<br>trouble<br>um the system is not able to save you<br>and there's a variation around the<br>country as well and obviously<br>socioeconomic deprivation and coor<br>Status are important<br>so um then as Richard said I moved to<br>norshore and that's been an incredibly<br>um productive and happy time um Sunny's<br>here sanket um un I'm not sure is here<br>Mike's uh got some family issues but we<br>have three great uh cnss and a great<br>research new so that's that team I think<br>um it's never about one person we do<br>some stuff um you know we teach we're<br>starting to experiment with virtual<br>reality we work with and Pacific<br>Secondary School students to try and<br>hook them into uh research careers and<br>John M Greg who's here helps with that<br>and we've had a number of fellows um<br>this is keman Rajkumar he will not send<br>me a photo from Glasgow and this is our<br>current fellow hoe who we will get a<br>photo of when he comes so we didn't<br>really have that<br>guy this is what we're starting to think<br>about now um if you look at surgery in<br>particularly complex surgery you need<br>you need to do those procedures a lot<br>um but we you know there 19 of 40<br>Advanced countries by the World Bank<br>have a population of 6 million or less<br>that's us relatively affluent but high<br>expectations of Health Care Service<br>delivery and procedural access so how do<br>you train in that environment and I'd<br>like to think we were the first people<br>to maybe highlight this particular issue<br>um it's easy in high volume environments<br>it's harder in low volume<br>environments um one of the things we did<br>over Co um I think it's<br>it's yeah 19 surgeons were on the um on<br>the panel and and John W is here today<br>and then uh these gu these guidelines um<br>were reviewed by 134 surgeons from 32<br>countries so we've been able to come up<br>with some non-volume related core<br>indicators of quality for liver reection<br>pancreatic reection bodu reection and G<br>rection so hopefully that might help um<br>they certainly<br>have you know they've been globally<br>accepted so that's a good thing and that<br>kind of kept us entertained on zoom over<br>Co and then there's this where should<br>surgery be performed um so that's a map<br>of the population of New Zealand and you<br>know the darker the color the more more<br>the people are there this is some of the<br>stuff I'm doing with the cancer agency<br>and there no no doubt that if you need<br>something tricky you better to have it<br>done in a place that does a lot and<br>surgical teams are better when we do a<br>lot so there's a Vogue for single Center<br>centralization but 80% of cancers<br>particularly are not receptable but<br>still have complex needs benign<br>conditions are not covered acute<br>conditions are not covered and that<br>system boy have we learned this in the<br>last few years vulnerable to weather<br>attack um you know earthquake Cyber<br>attack and and lockdown so unique<br>populations are not assisted and that's<br>the population density for Mari so the<br>dark Blues are weather's the most mty<br>and then the going through green so<br>They Don't Really marry up and so we<br>have an issue in this country about<br>where are we going to site our complex<br>surgery um how are we going to make that<br>work um and how we going to make it work<br>in a way that's important to<br>us well I love fi so<br>essentially means the right hand is<br>skillful the left hand um is uh also<br>skillful and so if you if you take a mar<br>that Serpentine figure they generally<br>have three fingers Manoa tooa and cordor<br>sorry coru and toru um and they're often<br>pulling a lizard out of the figure's<br>mouth which is a a a symbol of of<br>defeating death so we're starting to<br>think if we if we thought about how we<br>might configure surgical Services<br>someplace would be a Manoa it would be a<br>ring finger perhaps a little bit smaller<br>broader range of of procedures<br>um but without the detail but caring for<br>a lot of people Next Step Up would be<br>Tod perhaps the Regional District<br>Hospital a little bit more complexity<br>and then finally cord might be Orland<br>Hospital across the road so that's<br>putting into into a Marty framework<br>that's not hierarchical recognizes<br>everybody's contribution and you can't<br>have a hand without with just one finger<br>right you got to have three fingers so<br>that's a work on and that's some in some<br>way try to meld the world's bring the<br>surgical world and the Mari world<br>together um Donna's here this is Donna<br>carage she's a wrongo practitioner we've<br>just completed um a trial of ronga and<br>the surgical Outpatient Clinic with<br>surgical patients it's gone really well<br>and um we're looking at moving on to the<br>next steps one when we did an anonymized<br>survey at a hospital one sixth of uh<br>6,000 people um who work there used<br>wrong way um so it's it's already there<br>we're getting close there we go Richard<br>Shaw so he was in my seventh form class<br>he wrote a book called The Forgotten<br>Coast I'd recommend it to you Richard<br>grew up on a farm um in coastal tanaki<br>and this is about him finding out that<br>um the land his farm was on had actually<br>been The Gardens of par Haka a little<br>bit like the kuma patch um and that his<br>grandfather had actually been in the<br>constabulary that went in on November<br>the 5th and what that meant and it's a<br>very heartfelt and beautifully written<br>book um he doesn't look pleased to have<br>caught that tuna right he<br>looks um but of course that's not a<br>unusual<br>story um my wife's great-grandfather was<br>a Saddler uh in in the you know in the<br>Army on that time and tooya may well<br>have been amongst the children at the<br>Gateway that greeted the soldiers as<br>they came in so um our worlds have<br>always been close and you know even more<br>remarkable<br>um on the other side of LJ's family her<br>great-grandfather was in the Royal Navy<br>and was on the deck um of the Missour at<br>the signing of the Japanese surrender um<br>Peter namoki who my auntie Donnie<br>married was also there as the um Royal<br>New Zealand Navy representative so um<br>our worlds have always been close I<br>think not quite<br>overlapping so how do we how do we<br>finished I wondered how to finish this<br>so<br>this is Brett Brett um Brett Graham who<br>I think I can say is a friend he's an<br>artist he specializes in very large<br>works of art this is a partia behind him<br>self-c carved in panels um on a on a<br>basically a trailer um and his works are<br>measured in stories so that's in the<br>gavet Brewster Art Gallery in New<br>Plymouth that's um a a work that comes<br>from the word tyor Hanoi which means<br>cease the tide of wrongdoing um and is<br>about par Haka and is that our family<br>has been able to contribute with other<br>kind of taneki diaspora to that work<br>remaining now Brett is tyui so he's W so<br>what what a w be doing in paraka well um<br>after those uh those uh<br>conflicts things settled down and<br>actually the W and naama the northern<br>taranaki tribes actually I would say<br>they got on but they you know they<br>became allies and so when Paka was about<br>to be<br>invaded tooi sent down 12 12 ranga to k<br>marua um to be in parihaka when the<br>invasion happened they were all taken<br>prisoner and and sent to um sent to<br>denen where they performed hard labor so<br>um Brett's great-grandfather was one of<br>T marua so um again our world aren't so<br>far<br>apart I would this is a quote from aaran<br>and I was going to start the<br>presentation with us but when I actually<br>sat down to translate it um I thought it<br>so<br>tunari which essentially<br>means grow tender one to meet the needs<br>of your time may your hand Master the<br>modern ways of physical well-being and<br>may your heart cherish your ancestral<br>roots for for dignity and I hope that's<br>what I've done and I hope that's what<br>I'll continue to do and for the students<br>here I think that that's what we should<br>do uh last last picture so this is<br>ordinary part I spend a little bit more<br>time here uh these days you can just see<br>the mountain over there so um we don't<br>we didn't have many speakers in our um e<br>so every month they run a Kai corero<br>Workshop uh with me uh and some others<br>I'm no way the best student but it's<br>great and there's also um a PO group and<br>performance um so you can see that the<br>Rejuvenation the the changes are coming<br>um and this chair from the Department of<br>surgery<br>Umi<br>um um that's just another step in that<br>process<br>so<br>people up<br>highes<br>F<br>proud<br>for<br>what I was just saying is that<br>Jonathan Jonathan is incredible and what<br>was said before is that he is the first<br>Mai surgical Professor to be working<br>here at the University of Oakland but it<br>might be better SE by someone um of the<br>likes of Emma where he payter who said<br>uh we simultaneously celebrate you being<br>the first while reflecting on the that<br>you are the only the only mul or multi<br>surgical Professor here at the<br>University of Oakland and at the<br>conclusion of your lecture we celebrate<br>that you are the first and that you are<br>the only um but we look forward to being<br>the few being the more and being the<br>meeting as you have been and supported<br>us M students on our own Journeys um<br>both financially and also morally and<br>just as a really incredible and<br>fantastic<br>person<br>spee<br>spee<br>foree<br>for<br>foree<br>for<br>spee<br>wow<br>umura medicine head of the school of<br>UMO I'm totally moved by that I don't<br>think any words that I can say can show<br>how much this very special occasion<br>means to everybody you know I was going<br>to talk about the lecture but it's all<br>about Jonathan as as the person and<br>embodiment of the rang Tanga and his<br>Spirit of ARA so he's you know just<br>naturally teaching us and I've taken out<br>of that lecture so much and I'm sure<br>everybody here has as well you know<br>thank you for your generosity your<br>humility your clear and clever weaving<br>of um The Two Worlds and and showing us<br>in a way how we as a faculty as a health<br>system should be working together to<br>address the really important issues of<br>the time and I can't imagine a more<br>poignant week in which that you could<br>have been giving your an augle lecture<br>actually and so hopefully everybody's<br>gone out and voted so you so it really<br>remains for me to thank you Jonathan um<br>on behalf of paparangi myself and<br>Richard you know we're so honored to<br>have you in our particular units um you<br>um just you just don't understand how<br>important you are really actually as a<br>as a as a beacon as a sentinel as a a<br>person that will show us the ways<br>forward for um for us as faculty but<br>also for the<br>TOA we're very proud to honor you and um<br>to welcome you to the propor I I like P<br>as well so something i' grabb so my one<br>tonight is um mamua Kiti Amurri murri<br>koraa am MOA so those who lead give<br>sight to those who follow those who<br>follow hopefully um give Health to those<br>who lead and um Jonathan we really look<br>forward to your leadership over the<br>congratulations Jonathan we'd like to<br>just honor you with this small momento<br>of this<br>occasion congratulate you Ando again and<br>um<br>welcome<br>for I just want to add briefly to<br>conclude and thank Jonathan for his<br>outstanding lecture this evening as<br>philipper has described um it's a<br>privilege and an honor for us all to<br>have been here tonight Jonathan and the<br>journey you've taken us on I've<br>witnessed many inaugural lectures um<br>never been moved by one as much as I've<br>been moved by yours this evening that<br>the more may be many is for all of us to<br>think carefully about especially in this<br>week and the coming weeks we will need<br>the Collective I believe to ensure that<br>the more may be<br>many M toy is going to close us off and<br>say kakia for uh the drinks and nibbles<br>I invite you all to stay to congratulate<br>M I know Jonathan here on behalf of the<br>and the I just want to share with you a<br>on and thank you for sharing with us how<br>you got to where you are today and who<br>today um you are truly an<br>inspiration we call<br>H top of the list top of the
