This year, our guest speaker is Fergus Barrowman. We also announce the winners of the Sargeson Prize, Aotearoa's richest short story award, judged by Vincent O'Sullivan.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may

why New Zealand publishing is<br>always in crisis and always<br>thriving the the crisis is because<br>successful publishing is all about<br>economies of scale and with our small<br>population and competing as we do with<br>the bined output of the world's English<br>language publishing industry it's really<br>impossible for New Zealand Publishers to<br>regularly achieve economies of scale I<br>envy my colleagues in bigger markets<br>whose Staffing print runs and modest<br>successes are often not much bigger than<br>ours but whose big successes are many<br>times bigger and they transform the<br>averages across the whole<br>business and I envy my colleagues and<br>countries with a natural language<br>barrier you can see how it works when<br>you visit a Bookshop or even better when<br>you visit a publisher stand at the<br>Frankfurt book fair that publishes<br>choice of the world's best sellers and<br>Nobel Prize winners in Translation sign<br>by sign with their local<br>writers so what what is modest success<br>in a country of the size of<br>Alo um over 40 years a number that<br>hasn't changed even as our population<br>has grown from 3. 2 to 5.3 million is<br>that certain kinds of books short<br>stories literary essays quiet novels can<br>be well reviewed and short listed for<br>awards and sell between 400 and 500<br>copies an example is everything we hope<br>for Pip's collection of short stories<br>before her latest success sent it into<br>reprints and what that teaches me is<br>that we have to be able to take sales of<br>400 to 500 as modest success as meeting<br>expectations some books you hope many<br>books will do better others will break<br>out or the writer's next book will break<br>out but you need to be publishing enough<br>books that might stop at 400 to 500 to<br>get those bigger books part of that's<br>the law of averages how widely you have<br>to spread your BS in an unpredictable<br>game but it's also because writers want<br>to be in the company of their friends<br>as well as their idols and you have to<br>publish enough writers from the emerging<br>writer Community for those writers to go<br>on offering you their books um the IM<br>IML ma program grew from 10 to 20<br>students in 2002 and to 30 students in<br>2020 and a PhD was added in<br>208 meanwhile Flat's output of first<br>book has grow from 1 one or two per year<br>to five or six per year it's a symbiotic<br>relationship and those ratios seem to be<br>fairly standard um more numbers um when<br>I started vup in 1984 I read the truth<br>about publishing by Sir Stanley unn<br>first published in<br>1926 and one thing I learned is that a<br>publisher should expect productivity of<br>four to six books per full-time<br>equivalent staff member and and that's<br>always felt right uh this year year with<br>an FTE of six we're publishing 30 new<br>books plus reprints and<br>Classics and I<br>just a word about the classics um which<br>is a loose series we began a few years<br>ago to try to do more Justice to that<br>long backlist by mixing a few offshore<br>print runs of at least a thousand of<br>books like the vintner's luck and the<br>paba tree and Jeff Clark's classic of<br>ecological history now uru water<br>with mostly local digital break even<br>runs of 300 we're up to 25 books in<br>total so that's an average print run of<br>384<br>um for an international comparison uh<br>Grant's newly launched Classic series<br>which includes books like The Luminaries<br>and Rebecca solet's Men explain things<br>to me requires minimum annual sales of<br>2,000 coffees something we can barely<br>dream of<br>here something else I learned from Sir<br>Stanley is that the minimum commercially<br>viable print Runners<br>3000 which was true for V when I started<br>to do the budget in<br>1985 and it stayed in the back of my<br>mind as a constant but I was wrong um in<br>1983 with my first VW paycheck I went<br>down to Roy Parsons and bought three<br>hardback books I I've been eyeing up the<br>English Orden shames he's essay's<br>preoccupations and I forers biography of<br>Golds worthy Low's Dickinson I list<br>those to show you what a nerd I was um<br>I've still got them they cost me<br>$756 um a lot of money for someone who<br>just been a student um in$ 2023 and<br>that's<br>$355 um my best guess of what those<br>books would cost me today is $180<br>so the value of books has halved um but<br>costs haven't I did some back of the<br>envelope calculations based on current<br>retail price points and flap staff and<br>production costs and our<br>productivity and our minimum<br>commercially viable print run the<br>average at which we could be independent<br>of the University if the university ever<br>wanted us to be is 3 is 5,000 copies um<br>I talked to a couple of<br>my colleagues in commercial New Zealand<br>publishing houses and that's their<br>number to minimum sales projection of<br>5,000 copies um this year is a great<br>year uh we're going to reach that three<br>times with the x-man's carnival and its<br>second year and with pet and with buram<br>wood but that's just 10% of our output<br>for the year and some years we don't<br>reach it at all so why when the numbers<br>don't add up when our small open market<br>that's exposed to all of English<br>language publishing our relatively low<br>level of government funding our low<br>level of pirate private patronage is our<br>literary world so Lively with so many<br>exciting writers emerging so many books<br>being published so many book launches<br>festivals and readings um and part of<br>the answer obviously is the universities<br>um the growth of creative writing<br>programs it's not just the IM IML which<br>was the first and it's always been the<br>biggest but there's the program here and<br>programs in other universities and tery<br>institutes around the country and that's<br>helped create a couple of generations<br>now of new writers who simply have to be<br>heard where there are writers there will<br>be books so if writers don't find<br>opportunity with conventional publishing<br>they'll make their own and the<br>technology and knowhow barriers to entry<br>are lower than they've ever been which<br>is not what used to be sneered at as<br>vanity publishing so much as a kind of<br>collective publishing and it exactly<br>parallels what was happening in other<br>creative<br>Industries but the problem is that<br>there's no Prospect of these collectives<br>paying themselves for their labor think<br>of a couple of friends publishing two or<br>three books a year that's a quarter of a<br>full-time job for each of them on top of<br>their paid work probably in the public<br>service and their writing time so it's<br>important not not to be misled by the<br>constant Lively spontaneous activity in<br>New Zealand writing and Publishing it's<br>all creative and essential and exciting<br>but it's to a huge extent based on<br>self-sacrifice and it's<br>unsustainable and those Publishers are<br>inevitably going to come and go and<br>their publishing can't develop editorial<br>continuity or long-term support for a<br>writer's development or conservation and<br>renewal of<br>backlist uh which takes us back to the<br>universities because over the last 20<br>years while we've seen a withdrawal of<br>international Publishers from New<br>Zealand and new Independents have<br>struggled to reach<br>sustainability it has fallen to the<br>universities to pick up the slack um<br>it's not naturally the job of the<br>universities but I hope it<br>continues so I'm going to finish by<br>saying something now quickly<br>about what has been working for for us<br>in recent years us that's a publisher<br>flat that's committed to publishing<br>books that might only sell 400 to 500<br>copies because that's what the literary<br>Community needs to<br>thrive and know you'll have noticed that<br>my previous examples are all novelists<br>and apologies especially to the poets<br>that I should have mentioned or could<br>have mentioned um but back in the 20th<br>century the novel was the main event<br>almost the only event but that's Chang<br>changing and Memoirs essays and poetry<br>can gain almost the same cultural and<br>Commercial clout now as novels and Spark<br>just as much<br>excitement I think that what recent<br>breakout successes share is more<br>important than their differences in form<br>or category I'm thinking of greter and<br>valin a novel and of books by Ashley<br>Young her lindsy bird Chessy Henry tble<br>Rose Lou C<br>n<br>and to take just a few examples and<br>apologies to everyone else<br>and against column toy Bean's diagnosis<br>of our literature's prolonged<br>adolesence I want to put a different<br>spin on the use of a child's voice to<br>describe the world as though it had<br>never been named before I think that the<br>best of this generation of writers have<br>found ways to preserve that sense of<br>first naming<br>as a defense<br>against the clamor of the world as the<br>clamor of the world has got louder and<br>more<br>insistent bad reading thinks that<br>because this new writing sounds as if a<br>voice has just started up speaking it<br>must be naive or false good reading<br>listens for ancestry for trauma for<br>literature and politics for social media<br>self-performance and popular fictions<br>preformulated scripts for catastrophe<br>and atrocity and voices that have found<br>ways to evade capture by read made<br>rhetoric one of the first times I heard<br>this note clearly was in Ashley Young's<br>ma folio in 2009 I loved its mixture of<br>autobiographical essays true stories and<br>odd research and I loved the way that in<br>all of it actually sounded as if she'<br>just started up<br>speaking it took 7 years until 2016 for<br>can you tolerate this to be ready to<br>publish and one thing that Ashley did<br>was right for her blog frequently<br>immediately with no editorial mediation<br>and over this time this got rid of all<br>last traces of received literary style<br>in her writing readers sales follows a<br>wam Campbell price from y University and<br>international Publishers have all<br>followed um hero lindsy Bird by hero<br>lindsy bu also published in 2016 and an<br>amazing year um was another book that I<br>wanted to publish immediately I read it<br>as a folio in 2011 but it felt stale to<br>hear it already and 5 years later not a<br>single poem remained um I must admit<br>that when I read the new manuscript I<br>had a moment Keats is dead so me<br>from behind can we say that a university<br>press well of course we can um like all<br>Hero's poems this felt entirely fresh<br>but it was also Roofing on tradition on<br>Bill manhire Roofing on IR Masons<br>Shakespeare Milton Keat are dead I<br>remember discussing Hero's viral success<br>and we exported hundreds of copies from<br>our website at ruinous postal prices<br>which people were prepared to pay before<br>penguin UK picked it up with the<br>American poet and critic Stephanie Bird<br>Steph thought that that her was leading<br>the world and her ability to mix high<br>and low in a voice that felt at once<br>completely spontaneous and like s prayer<br>and as an aside Steph thought that what<br>made it possible for this to happen here<br>in ALA was the existence of our<br>literature of James K Baxter's Jerusalem<br>poems I'll just leave that there um<br>chesse Henry's 2016 ma folio was CI ala<br>after the Great inundation<br>and an arduous Journey from the islanded<br>highrises of Wellington down through the<br>South Island to reunite a family it was<br>a really good novel um some scenes are<br>really Vivid in my memory and it needed<br>work from a publishing point of view did<br>the teenage protagonist and Quest<br>narrative meant it had to be ya fiction<br>and if so did some of the content need<br>to be toned down not because of what<br>teenagers can tolerate but because of<br>what the IND hisory thinks they can<br>tolerate which is also a literary<br>question of whether the naive voice with<br>which the book set out was adequate for<br>where it<br>went um chesse tossed that up for a<br>little while and then chose to write<br>something completely different um we can<br>make a life is a book that combines the<br>story of her father's First Response<br>role at the collapsed CTV building and<br>the Christ earthquake um and its impact<br>of his mental health because though a<br>doctor that he just happened to be<br>passing by and he threw himself into it<br>and had no followup um with a family<br>Memoir including her childhood largely<br>spent on a yacht and the loss of her<br>family home in the cura earthquake ch's<br>writing is beautifully simple but what<br>makes the book rich is the nonlinear<br>time scheme that dramatizes her coming<br>to terms with the things in her life as<br>she lived it through the years and in<br>the year that she spent writing it um<br>chesse sensibly sent her proposal to<br>several Publishers and she took on board<br>the message that a simplified Memoir<br>from her father's point of view that<br>moved forward in time was what the<br>market wanted and to my delight chose to<br>publish proceed with the book she<br>originally wanted to write and I was<br>delighted that the market turned out to<br>want it too and we're still reprinting<br>that book uh for t tb's two books<br>Pocahontas and rura I can't do better<br>than quote her American publisher John<br>Freeman that they demonstrate the power<br>of all Paradigm shifting books which is<br>to fold up previously naughty stumbling<br>blocks like their Furniture left out in<br>the rain and then replace it with an<br>enlarged<br>space Rose L all who live on Islands a<br>book of essays or a discontinuous memoir<br>gives us access not only to the<br>Contemporary Chinese multi-generation<br>immigrant experience but also to teen<br>drinking and bunk room sex of feno to<br>power games in the Wellington tech<br>industry and to Solo treking in the<br>Himalayas uh Rose is now facing the what<br>to do next problem that all bestselling<br>first memoirists have what do you do<br>after you published the first Memoir and<br>you're in your 20s so I'm pleased to<br>report that the opening chapters of<br>rose's first novel strike exactly the<br>same note of just starting up speaking<br>while also setting out on a proper<br>plot C nles too sets her and tufaro<br>fakap papa together with her Coast<br>Salish Heritage by imagining that the<br>coasts of British Colombia and ala are<br>as close as her two Al places carpet and<br>moror in a book that can equally be<br>called novels short stories and M and<br>poetry it's one of those books that's<br>completely Lucid in its moments and<br>deeply mysterious as a whole um and it's<br>found many readers here and it's now<br>finding them in her other home with the<br>Canadian House of an Andy<br>press and I'm going to end with SMA R<br>Perry who I first met here in kir Kira<br>um I can't remember if it was a book<br>launch for Katherine Chi or a book<br>launch for Tracy Slaughter or when<br>Elizabeth delivered her side lecture I'm<br>pretty sure it was 2016 though which was<br>before Isa moved to Wellington to do<br>their Ma and we've since published two<br>wonderful books truly Beyond category<br>ransac and Akida um especially Akida is<br>a book that really moves<br>and still puzzles me it's blend of<br>fuckera and Greek myth its public<br>performance and its deep privacy its<br>Transcendence of the categories of Novel<br>Memoir and poetry um Isa isn't here<br>tonight because the been short wased for<br>the K Hume award at the Mari literature<br>trusts paho Awards which is happening<br>right now so I'm going to end with best<br>wishes and good luck to Essa best wishes<br>and good luck to the serson prize<br>finalists and to all of you writers and<br>readers in the audience uh thanks for<br>listening<br>Kiora Fus thanks so much for that<br>insight into the engine room of so much<br>that's going on<br>in their hottest research laboratory in<br>um so I'd like now to hand over to<br>Katherine Chi who's going to be<br>20123 my welcome to the announcement of<br>the fifth annual Sison<br>prize earlier this year staff published<br>an analysis of Google search data around<br>job types and they included the question<br>how to be a dot dot dot and in ALA the<br>job that topped the list as most<br>desirable was<br>writer so this Keen interest in the<br>written word is borne out by the huge<br>enthusiasm with which our writers have<br>embraced the seson prize this year we<br>received almost 1100 entries across the<br>open and secondary schools<br>divisions in November last year we lost<br>Jeff Cochran one of our best writers<br>published by<br>Fergus um and in one of his pieces he<br>revealed what he called his secretest<br>trade<br>secret as a young man setting out to be<br>a writer he said I taught myself to<br>finish what I'd<br>started and that's an excellent<br>discipline to learn and a discipline<br>that the seson prize encourages there's<br>nothing like the motivation of that<br>deadline some thank yous first to our<br>chief judge the iconic Vincent O<br>Sullivan for taking on the task of<br>selecting our winners from a very strong<br>field it's a huge honor to have one of<br>our finest and most decorated writers at<br>the<br>helm thank you to the University of<br>white cutle who have sponsored the prize<br>for five glorious years now I'm<br>particularly grateful to our um Vice<br>Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley and<br>our Pro Vice Chancellor Professor<br>Patrick Leman for their continuing<br>support of our country's richest short<br>story conf I it's become a celebrated<br>fix fixture on our literary calendar<br>with the open division winner receiving<br>$10,000 as well as a two-e writing<br>residency at bison Center in Albert Park<br>in<br>Oakland the secondary school's division<br>winner receives $2,000 and a week-long<br>writing residency this summer they'll<br>come and live in the halls of residents<br>here at<br>or um with all meals provided along with<br>an office in the school of arts and<br>one-on-one feedback on their work from a<br>member of our wonderful writing studies<br>program thank you to Steve bronius and<br>newsroom's reading room for publishing<br>the winning stories thank you to my<br>colleagues in English and writing<br>studies and to my assistants Jesse<br>Burton and David<br>Wrigley last year's open division winner<br>um lean O'Brien wrote a piece for<br>reading room 11 reasons to enter the<br>seson prize her number one reason was<br>Vincent O Sullivan is the judge and Owen<br>Marshall probably too much of a<br>gentleman to<br>submit so thank you most of all to<br>everyone who did submit um there would<br>be no seson pre without you I did some<br>calculations to figure out the total<br>word count of all the entries this year<br>um an exercise that I dreamed of when I<br>should have been writing but we won't<br>dwell on<br>that and it's<br>2,884<br>788 words about 36 books so thank you<br>for entrusting us with everyone of your<br>words and please send us some more next<br>year we're lucky enough to have some of<br>our winners here tonight and shortly<br>they'll give us a taste of their stories<br>but I'll hand over to Vincent o salivan<br>now who will announce the winners and to<br>our proce Chancellor Professor Patrick<br>certificates what an honor it was to be<br>invited to read this range of<br>contemporary New Zealand short stories<br>and to choose from so many that are good<br>the ones that seem to me the best<br>and how appropriate for the seson prize<br>to yet again confirm why K University is<br>the strongest force field for our short<br>story fiction<br>writers at a time when there a fewer<br>places to publish this form of fiction<br>in hard copy than they were even 50<br>years ago and so the incentive to write<br>is more<br>confined all the more reason to<br>celebrate what W<br>University with Katherine chy and her<br>world how glad I am too to connect again<br>with the University where I worked for<br>nine years soon after the English<br>Department and the University was<br>established and to have to say publicly<br>how much I owe the present Vice<br>Chancellor in earlier lives we both<br>worked at Victoria<br>University and if we were not for Neil<br>quickly support at that<br>time I would not have been able to<br>complete my biography of Ralph<br>watery so thank you indeed for that<br>Neil now during my own early years on<br>the campus when the cafeteria was still<br>a Target up milking<br>sh I wrote my first<br>stories one of them was about Frank<br>and Frank serson wrote kindly to me when<br>he read<br>it there are so many of my generation<br>and the generations<br>after who owe much to<br>seson for the sacrifices he made to<br>advance the form of<br>fiction that means so much to us as<br>writers or<br>readers although I must to complete the<br>story mention that when I first became<br>interested in Katherine mansor<br>Frank warned me against giving too much<br>of my time to what he called the dreams<br>of a Kori school<br>girl so now to the prize and its<br>winners my first impression when it came<br>to judging the secondary school's<br>division was the totally unexpected or<br>at least to me it was the maturity of<br>the<br>writing and by that I mean a<br>sophistication in dealing with<br>relationships with family<br>crosscurrents with constant challenge of<br>personal values against conventions and<br>social<br>pressures that were light years in<br>advance of either santon's generation or<br>mine and even more perhaps I was struck<br>by the deftness right the awareness of<br>craft and its demands and that<br>commitment to language that is good<br>fiction striving<br>force it takes some writers a lifetime<br>to know that and here were<br>already in the secondary schools of<br>vision I have highly commanded six<br>stories these<br>um is<br>stranged by anah mundam of Tyrie<br>College Tragedy by Z<br>Murray of toroa

Ordinary World we all<br>share presented in feing realistic<br>ways it can only be a compliment to say<br>that the story at times reminded me of<br>Janet<br>Frank what it shares with her is the<br>ability to turn the narrative in<br>unexpected ways for example in giving<br>the main speaking part not to a human<br>but to a house with its perceptions on<br>some of those who live<br>there but who is the house that takes in<br>so much to some extent it is language<br>itself a presence that refuses to be<br>confined it is eloquent and<br>perceptive The Narrative voice of things<br>simply<br>being second prize then goes<br>to triptic by Leo Reed of Chris high<br>school we now hear Le read part of her<br>story<br>fifth<br>guest hello<br>iron the first thing that you worry<br>about is that you are<br>here I know all your<br>names I know all the ones you've ever<br>had and all the ones you'll ever use I<br>can recite them back to<br>you they are the Fallen monarchs and the<br>timeline of your life little Domino<br>soldiers that you slash the bellies off<br>to watch the syntax spill<br>sometimes you think that a nameb that<br>you haven't heard in years is going to<br>rise to the lips of someone long<br>gone every night Dad brings someone home<br>you look through the keyhole at the<br>shapes that her lips make waiting and<br>waiting for the right one they're always<br>tacking from lipstick it is never the<br>right shade and it is never the right<br>you<br>my first choice is a story which deeply<br>intrigued<br>me not because it was about colonization<br>and its legacies which to some extent it<br>was but because in a sense it assumed<br>that is a given with no need to hammer<br>at home allowing the story that a Carri<br>to be told delicately<br>humorously as a fairly casual<br>event what held me most was the<br>confidence of its<br>style all that apparently happens is<br>that a Nigerian girl in her Pia<br>boyfriend are at a swimming pool where<br>its young swimmers of variously on show<br>watching and hoping to be watched there<br>was the erotic alertness of bodies close<br>by carefully on<br>display it becomes a story about the<br>confidence of<br>oneself the escape from scrutiny and<br>condescension nothing in the story is<br>overdone there is the constant flicker<br>of amusement and the whole scene I loved<br>its subtlety and its light<br>I admired its maturity and fine<br>observation it is a story of<br>self-contained charm and line by line as<br>a delight to<br>to the catastrophe of<br>swimming by T mishe<br>adale of St Hilda's Collegian College<br>story hi everyone this is how my short<br>story<br>starts I fix my Gaze on the pole on the<br>other side of the swimming pool instead<br>of focusing on my boyfriend or the girl<br>he's watching the plant that sits near<br>the fence separating the pool from the<br>parking lot is weirdly shaped so I give<br>it a glance figting amusement at the<br>oblique curve of its branches I read<br>aloud the rules of the pool restrictions<br>from the entry sign no eating or<br>drinking in the pool water and no<br>running in the pool area see I made a<br>joke this distracts my boyfriend<br>momentarily he Chuckles and reaches<br>across the little space between our dead<br>chairs to grasp my wrist when he rests<br>his head against the back of his chair<br>and turns to watch the girl again I<br>don't follow her stare I don't pretend<br>to clear my throat or sneeze I don't say<br>stop it the sun is shin shining even<br>glittering over the surface of the water<br>I admire the scenery while quietly<br>humming to myself I cast a glimpse<br>behind my boyfriend's head which is<br>turned away from me and towards the girl<br>thank<br>you<br>turning now to the open<br>division the following of the six<br>commend how that is in Dreams by Rebecca<br>ball of West<br>Melton the Long Way Home by Mela Kalan<br>of<br>ay the boys by B Jes of<br>OT the new Reign by imma Mar of<br>theara<br>Wellington she who hears the suffering<br>of the<br>World by Jackie Lee Morrison of The for<br>Tara<br>Willington and<br>270 over three by Naomi<br>Mako and speaking of the open division<br>what came home to me was just how good<br>many of these stories were and how<br>diverse<br>how each of the three finalists so<br>convincingly mind vastly different<br>settings and found such differently<br>compelling ways to present<br>them the story I've chosen for third is<br>one that on the face of it takes us to a<br>place in a time we may think we<br>know because here is a group of girls in<br>the last year at school insisting how<br>close they are each secretly defensive<br>and from backgrounds that are more<br>varied than they<br>think this is average New<br>Zealand and that average at first glance<br>Pleasant and bland is a place where<br>personal error throws a long Shadow and<br>the grief of years as it must surely be<br>so casually<br>occurs this is a clever and well told<br>story the freedom youth<br>believes is so frail a<br>thing it is so it is told Wily the<br>voices are spot on the slow inevitable<br>distress the more telling for it<br>seemingly casual<br>to apple<br>wine by clear graay of alah Christ<br>Church clear join<br>us<br>tonight without KLA here I asked Tracy<br>to explain about Bridge she looks<br>surprised like the tournaments I go to<br>and stuff no I say about the game how<br>you play how you play yeah I listen<br>while she talks about winning tricks and<br>bidding I watch a plant and a mccam<br>hanger drop small brown leaves onto the<br>floor and think how the leaves are<br>falling in a way that is random and yet<br>very beautiful<br>are you following this Tracy asks no I<br>say but I like listening to your talk my<br>mouth is dry and I think how the air<br>around us seems suddenly clearer more<br>refined so that I can see everything<br>Tracy included in perfect<br>definition what else do you want to know<br>I think for a moment what makes you so<br>good at it oh she says without<br>hesitation it's the patterns when I play<br>head<br>among all the<br>stories the second place<br>winner was by far the most<br>unexpected something unique among New<br>Zealand's stories that I've<br>read it's a far cry from what the<br>title might suggest<br>it is nowhere near Barbie country a long<br>way from the expectations of Glamour or<br>display that the title might hint at if<br>you saw it on the cover of a<br>magazine it is that rare thing a story<br>primarily about ideas about intellectual<br>definitions about how philosophical<br>convictions shape behavior and drive<br>events<br>what carries the narrative is how and<br>why a principled female Professor tells<br>a male student he is<br>beautiful and is called before an Ethics<br>Committee you'd be hard put to find a<br>story remotely like<br>this it is finally<br>written and totally<br>admirable second prize goes to<br>on<br>Beauty by Jake Arthur of TOA Tara<br>Willington I walked up to the<br>professor's House of celvin listening to<br>the of my smart<br>she opened the door pulled me<br>inside she told me I gained weight but I<br>had AE we drank corners of my forehead<br>which my hairline had<br>received she told me i' been the most<br>beautiful boy she used the past<br>T I had been Min St<br>sebasti she told me she had thrilled<br>physically to see me enter a room she<br>had dedicated her fourth book to me<br>didn't I realize she picked it up off a<br>shelf in her liary and showed it to me I<br>remembered reading it voraciously at<br>night while my fiance was asleep the<br>dedication read for St Sebastian his<br>Beauty the professor was very pleased to<br>see me nonetheless the university she<br>said was a corpse in advanced Decay and<br>I was lucky to have escaped the worst of<br>its my<br>Asma<br>it was same a dreadful impertinence to<br>claim one knows how the dead<br>think but I Hazard anyway that Sison<br>would go along with my choice of first<br>place it could not be more convincingly<br>said in a compellingly detailed rural<br>New<br>Zealand or feel as advertising might say<br>so close to<br>her its language is<br>exact line by line it is a Triumph of<br>restrained but ferous style HED for what<br>it has to<br>do the dialogue is Spar and exact The<br>Narrative voice dead<br>straight perhaps most of all the pacing<br>of the story is<br>superb so slightly working towards the<br>end this is a story that joins that<br>small but essential<br>group of New Zealand<br>stories that attend to women in the<br>isolation of farming or the<br>bush from the feale M Seer through to<br>the present day narratives that break<br>one kind of reality into something<br>utterly<br>different it is there with mil one of<br>Mansfield's few back block<br>stories it shares the same sense of<br>growing<br>pressure of<br>remoteness and carries a comparable<br>ambiguity until a final psychological<br>Clarity that destroys so much of what<br>went<br>before I'm delighted to declare that the<br>winner of the 2023 sergeon prize is pig<br>hunting by Anna Woods of Tamaki<br>us<br>Pig pting<br>it happened all at once I couldn't<br>separate it in my mind the dark shape of<br>Paul stepping from behind a tree and<br>shorts in a swand Dr red bands scuffing<br>his cves and the pig broad shoulders a<br>dark Smoky blue tusks curved back on<br>themselves like a dropped segment of<br>moon eyes reflected and<br>golden I hoisted the rifle over my<br>shoulder released the safety and shot<br>the sound rang out across the galley a<br>loud crack like thunder in the hungry<br>Darkness through the beating moth Wings<br>the pushing wind the Shivering gloworms<br>down in the creek bed the now silent Ru<br>Bose never found kiwi the screams of the<br>children over pol's frantic bark through<br>the heart of the<br>night it started the day we woke to rakx<br>under the guava tree deep farrows where<br>a whiskery snout had churn the Earth ly<br>and scarred with the orange burn of clay<br>that yokey color that smeared across the<br>sky sometimes the morning of a heavy<br>rain thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
