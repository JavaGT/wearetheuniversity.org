I'm a senior lecturer at the <br>University of Waikato. Most of the biodiversity and  <br>biocurity responses we employ in New Zealand <br>currently are reactive it's much harder to put  <br>money towards a problem if it's not actually <br>here yet but what we really need is we need  <br>greater investment in proactive responses that <br>help us to not only sort of understand how <br>Invasion works and how biodiversity changes <br>take place but allow us to predict them and  <br>prevent them from happening in the first place <br>we would really love your support. In my research I  <br>combined genomic and ecological tools to <br>really try and understand how populations  <br>become different when they environment <br>changes being able to monitor changes  <br>in biodiversity and detect invasive species is <br>increasingly important as the climate changes  <br>but currently the tools that we have at our <br>disposal they only capture part of the story  <br>My students and I the University of Waikato<br>are looking at the intricate balance between  <br>biodiversity and invasive species and one one of <br>the ways we're doing this is using a tool known  <br>as environmental DNA or Edna current methods in <br>Edna are mostly focused on water filtration and  <br>so what I'm proposing to do with this research <br>is look at alternative methods like idna this is  <br>invertebrate derived DNA so this means capturing <br>insects and having a look at what they've been  <br>eating and otherwise interacting with and in <br>conjunction with that a new method called Air<br>DNA where we literally are able to extract DNA <br>from thin air so we're focusing research on an  <br>ecological Corridor that runs between Pirongia and <br>Maungatautari a key difference with this project is that  <br>we're actually going to be able to get some real <br>applied benefits really really quickly over the  <br>long term we can envisage that tools <br>that we create could be translated into something  <br>like a National Monitoring grid so that we way <br>more rapidly detect invasive species when they  <br>first come into the country. The research that <br>my team and I are doing here at the University  <br>of Waikato is absolutely crucial in the face of climate <br>change we need to build the these tools we need  <br>to understand ecosystem Dynamics in order to <br>work towards a more sustainable future</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
