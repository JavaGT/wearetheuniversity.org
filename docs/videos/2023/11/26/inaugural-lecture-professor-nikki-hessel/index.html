maps onto the early years of Pākehā arrival in Aotearoa, yet we don’t usually consider the influence of Romantic writing on this country’s past, present, and future.<br><br>In this inaugural professorial lecture, Professor Nikki Hessell from the School of English, Film, Theatre, Media and Communication, and Art History, discusses the way the poetry of William Wordsworth can help us understand the intellectual worlds of early Pākehā settlers and the continuing importance of Romantic literature for life in 21st century Aotearoa.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

vice<br>Chancellor of the Victoria University of<br>Wellington to H Anda Walker and it's my<br>huge pleasure to welcome everybody here<br>tonight friends family distinguished<br>guests academic and professional<br>colleagues students and our White<br>Community to the inaugural lecture of<br>Nikki Hessel professor of romantic<br>literature uh I I tried to convince<br>Nikki in the uh conversation we've just<br>had to tell me something that would be<br>fun and interesting and slightly<br>embarrassing and she very steadfastly<br>refused and so I'm confident that the<br>entertainment will come in her lecture<br>but uh the reason I I wanted to do that<br>was the list of her achievements is long<br>and imposing and I don't think does<br>Justice to the humanity and energy that<br>she's brought to this University<br>Professor hle completed her ba honors in<br>English and her master of arts with<br>distinction uh in English uh at this<br>fine University before she headed north<br>to the University of Toronto where she<br>did her PhD in English her interest is<br>in romantic literature and that was<br>first sparked for her when she was<br>taught here by now Emeritus Professor<br>Haiti Thompson a huge<br>respected academic in this University<br>many of whom who will know uh and uh<br>Professor Asel tells me that she was<br>immediately drawn to the intellectual<br>world of Romanticism with its focus on<br>issues which I think are important today<br>uh as much as they ever have been<br>environment<br>self-reflection political and social<br>change Professor Hassel has taken those<br>Concepts and evolved from that PhD into<br>an internationally recognized expert and<br>18th century British romantic literature<br>she's particularly interested in the<br>intersection of British print culture<br>and Indigenous people's writing in the<br>relationship between journalism and<br>literature and this is evidenced in her<br>many outputs uh one of the most notable<br>recent ones is a highly regarded book<br>published in 2021 sensitive negotiations<br>indigenous diplomacy and British<br>romantic<br>poetry alongside her Stellar research<br>career who many contributions to<br>teaching she's also held leadership<br>roles in this University and contributed<br>both formally and formally in those<br>facets she's known for the spirit of<br>collegiality and collaboration that she<br>brings to these uh as associate Dean<br>Equity uh in her faculty is Deputy head<br>of the school of English film theater<br>and media Communications and art history<br>and is program director for English L<br>Communications in this lecture Professor<br>hasser will focus on the work of William<br>woodsworth who I think we see uh on the<br>slides in front of us she will discuss<br>the way that his poetry can help us<br>understand the intellectual worlds of<br>the early paky house sers you would<br>outline the continuing importance of<br>romantic literature for life that moves<br>from those early days with the early Pak<br>settlers to today in 21st century ARA<br>and it's in that context that I'm<br>greatly looking forward to professor<br>professor hessel's lecture uh her<br>understanding of romantic literature and<br>what that culture can tell us about the<br>world that we live in today and how we<br>can through her eyes gain an<br>understanding of countries like ours and<br>how they've ended up the way that they<br>are ladies and gentlemen it's my great<br>Hessel Chancellor Tina<br>thank you everyone uh for coming out<br>tonight it's lovely to see uh everyone<br>here I'm just scanning the room looking<br>at all the faces um before I start into<br>the lecture proper there's just some<br>people in the room and beyond that I'd<br>like to acknowledge uh tonight um first<br>of all my family who are occupying a lot<br>of the seats on the left hand side of<br>the room um and especially Carn and our<br>children who are here in the front row<br>um secondly our students um I know there<br>are former and current students who<br>registered for the talk tonight um I<br>think it's quite hard to get across to<br>the students how appreciated and cared<br>for they are um so this is just to say<br>to all of you that we really value what<br>you do in our classrooms the work that<br>you produce and what you do Beyond when<br>we see you leave the institution and all<br>the things that you're capable of um I<br>did enjoy the students who emailed me<br>and said I not coming in person but I<br>I'll watched the<br>recording it's a story of my life um but<br>the me me from students were really<br>really appreciated people who can't be<br>here and some of whom are<br>overseas um thirdly I'd like to um thank<br>friends from other parts of my life and<br>especially my friends from high school<br>uh who are who are here um no one really<br>knows you as well as the people who knew<br>you when you were very young the vice<br>chancellor has asked me for funny<br>stories I've refused to supply them um<br>and so perhaps um you could all help him<br>out later but um I'm very lucky to have<br>you in my life and we're very lucky to<br>raised our children as a group together<br>I think and finally I'd like to thank<br>all of my colleagues academic and<br>professional um and my own wonderful<br>program um English literatures and<br>creative Communication in my school Siam<br>car um in the faculty of humanities and<br>social sciences and across the<br>university um and the other faculties in<br>campuses and I can see people here for<br>the other campuses tonight I can also<br>see Elizabeth Gray from Messi and I<br>started my uh academic career at Messi<br>university so across the sector shall we<br>say today um all of you but especially<br>the elk program make this job such a joy<br>and such a pleasure to teach alongside<br>you um just amongst those groups of<br>colleagues uh I would like to just<br>acknowledge three very special groups um<br>first of all the people who are my<br>colleagues now but once upon a time were<br>my lecturers um as Nick said I'm a<br>graduate of this institution I've had<br>the rare privilege of teaching alongside<br>people who taught me um not just in<br>English but in other disci as well and I<br>wasn't always the most um diligent and<br>attentive undergraduate student um mind<br>on other things uh but um I thank you so<br>much I thank you so much for your um<br>your time your investment in me um as a<br>student and then as a colleague and I<br>hope that I'm seeing me standing here<br>tonight is abundant recompense as<br>Woodworth would say um second I'd like<br>to acknowledge all of the colleagues<br>academic and professional who in the<br>last few months have either taken<br>voluntary redundancy or who um have had<br>their jobs<br>disestablished occasions like this<br>evening focus our mind on individual<br>achievement um but we all know in this<br>room that there are no individual<br>achievements at a university uh we get<br>where we are because we're part of a<br>community of academic staff and<br>professional staff and students who work<br>together and put this massive Collective<br>effort uh around what we want to do um<br>I've been the beneficiary of an<br>extraordinary level of generosity uh<br>from colleagues academic and<br>professional um especially in my own<br>program um that's going to be more<br>difficult I think for us to maintain now<br>that we have fewer and fewer staff<br>members um so what I'd like to say to<br>all the colleagues who are leaving<br>whatever the circumstances just a<br>reminder our country is immeasurably<br>weaker because of decisions that have<br>been taken in tery policy and funding in<br>the last two decades and I'm<br>immeasurably weaker for the loss of all<br>of<br>you finally I'd like to acknowledge one<br>very special group of colleagues who are<br>very close to my heart when I was an<br>undergraduate here in the 1990s there<br>had only even been one woman professor<br>of English um I wasn't actually ever<br>taught by Joan Stevens she had long<br>since retired uh before I joined the<br>university um as a student but I'd like<br>to acknowledge here tonight and to think<br>about what an extraordinary achievement<br>and probably quite a lonely achievement<br>it was uh to be the first woman<br>professor of English here when I joined<br>the staff in 2011 Katherine walls had<br>just been promoted to Professor I think<br>I saw Katherine there she is hi<br>Katherine um and it was actually at my<br>first school meeting that Katherine's<br>promotion was<br>announced um since then we've had a<br>veritable Bonanza uh first Janes<br>Stafford Who's down the back there then<br>uh Hai Thompson who Nick mentioned um<br>was my is my wonderful mentor and friend<br>um Haiti sends her apologies to not well<br>today so she won't be able to come along<br>um and last year it was my great<br>pleasure um to sit down with my dear<br>friend s Ross and plan how we were both<br>going to get to Professor uh work on our<br>applications together and sort of drag<br>ourselves and each other over the line<br>and the day we found out we' both been<br>promoted was a very very exciting day<br>indeed Sarah and I can have an argument<br>later about which of us is the fifth and<br>which of us is the sixth uh woman<br>professor of English I haven't given a<br>lot of thought but you'll notice I got<br>first anyway it's a great honor to stand<br>here as either the fifth or the sixth<br>woman professor of English atting Walker<br>and say that's not really a thing we<br>don't talk about who the fifth and the<br>sixth people are um people don't argue<br>about it because by the time you get<br>into those kind of numbers you can be<br>fairly sure as a group that you've built<br>a pathway that other people will be able<br>to follow and you don't need to focus on<br>anymore we know the great Paradox of<br>white women the world over which is that<br>it's genuinely very hard for us to get<br>to these positions and you only have to<br>look at the professorial announcements<br>to know that that's true and much much<br>easier fast than it is for women of<br>color to put it uh in the most local<br>terms we know that Teta didn't get to be<br>a<br>professor so I'm very proud of this I'm<br>going to celebrate with you all tonight<br>but let will get up tomorrow and build a<br>better<br>University on with the<br>lecture in 1841 when the New Zealand<br>company Drew up its map for the proposed<br>settlement of Wellington it named four<br>streets in the area that we now know as<br>the Ador Valley Ador Street Mount street<br>epuni street and woodsworth<br>Street locals will be familiar with the<br>first of those three names but might be<br>struggling to place woodsworth Street on<br>the mental map of the area that's<br>because woodsworth Street was renamed it<br>was the part of UT Street between Mount<br>and Willis and it was later and folded<br>into ID Street and took on that<br>name woodsworth Street was named for the<br>great romantic poet William woodsworth<br>who was still alive in 1841 when this<br>map was drawn up I want to use this<br>moment of flickering when his name<br>appears and then disappears from our<br>local landscape to think about what<br>romantic poetry has to teach us about<br>Park our history and identity about what<br>we choose to remember and what we choose<br>to<br>forget Justice Joe Williams once said<br>that the nation state of New Zealand was<br>founded by two peoples Cook's people and<br>koop's people tonight I'd like to<br>consider what it means to read romantic<br>poetry as one of Cook's people that is<br>not just as a white reader or a settler<br>reader but quite specifically as a park<br>hour reader someone shaped by the<br>connections between Cook's people and<br>koop's people on these Islands one of<br>the extraordinary gifts Park hour were<br>given on the 6th of February 1840 was<br>the chance to look a new at the<br>traditions and cultures we had come from<br>to consider them from the perspective of<br>Al and the arrangement that was forged<br>that day one of co-governance yes but<br>also one of co-creation of knowledge<br>systems that would entwine and change<br>each<br>other the Romantic Period of literary<br>history is a very short one and we<br>usually choose two dates as the<br>conventional St starting and ending<br>points for it the onset of the French<br>Revolution in<br>1789 and the passage of the great Reform<br>Act in Britain In<br>1832 it was a time of massive upheaval<br>and change in Europe but those dates are<br>quite arbitrary ones and if we look at<br>them closely if we look at them from<br>these islands we can see the shadow of<br>another set of meaningful dates that<br>would work just as well the period<br>between 1769 in Cook's arrival in the<br>Pacific and 1840 and the signing of Titi<br>covers the early period of relations<br>between Marty and Parker and it's a very<br>close match with the Romantic Period<br>there is a dense circularity to this<br>overlap the Romantic writers who emerged<br>in the wake of 1769 were deeply<br>influenced by Cook's voyages and the<br>knowledge experiences and imperialist<br>actions he encountered or<br>perpetrated in turn romantic poetry was<br>the literature that early paria rals and<br>after<br>especially from the 1820s onwards<br>brought with them in literal books but<br>also in their hearts and their<br>heads so my pitch to you this evening is<br>that the influence here is like a<br>constant<br>reverberation romantic poetry can be<br>read really effectively from the<br>perspective of Cook's people or indeed<br>koop's people but that's not my story to<br>tell and can likewise help us understand<br>the way Cook's people behaved then<br>behave now and might choose to behave in<br>the future<br>to do this I'm going to focus on William<br>woods with himself and use four<br>different poems to suggest four<br>different ways that his poetry might<br>inform what we know of our past present<br>and<br>future I'm taking inspiration here from<br>Maria barges anural I can't see Maria oh<br>she's<br>hiding um Maria gave a wonderful<br>inaugural earlier in the year where she<br>used four stories to tell um the story<br>of of Marty governance um and so I'm<br>hoping to kind of<br>um uh kick myself off that that<br>Foundation that she laid but also to<br>question methodologically some of what<br>underpins the idea of an inaugural to<br>inaugurate something is to commence<br>something to begin it but it implies<br>that atomized and highly individualized<br>starting from scratch idea of knowledge<br>uh that we sometimes think of as<br>characterizing universities although<br>that's not my actual experience of how<br>the university operates but there's no<br>Blank Space here in which you get to<br>write my name no Teran alus of knowledge<br>that I get to inscribe with my own ideas<br>I hope that by responding to Maria I can<br>model not an inaugural but maybe a<br>continual into which we each bring some<br>insight or experience we've gained in<br>our careers and most significantly<br>gained from listening to and<br>collaborating with each other a little<br>about woodsworth first of all he was<br>born in kria in 17770 the year after<br>cook arrived in the Pacific his parents<br>died when he was quite Young and he and<br>his siblings were sent to live with<br>different relatives and raised apart<br>from one another in the late 1790s now<br>adults woodsworth and his sister Dorothy<br>set up a home together in Grassmere in<br>the Lake District while he was living in<br>Grassmere woodsworth embarked on a<br>series of poems called poems on the<br>naming of places this group of poems<br>recounted the woodsworth circle's<br>practice of assigning names to places of<br>significance to them in their new home<br>when he published these poems in 1800<br>woodsworth included a short and very<br>revealing headnote about his poems by<br>persons resident in the country and<br>attached to rural objects many places<br>will be found unnamed or of unknown<br>names where little incidents will have<br>occurred or feelings been experienced<br>which will have given to such places a<br>private and peculiar interest from a<br>wish to give some sort of record to such<br>incidents or renew the gratification of<br>such feelings names have been given to<br>places by the author and some of his<br>friends and the following poems written<br>in<br>consequence we can see some fairly clear<br>parallels here between what woodsworth<br>is thinking and the conduct of Cook or<br>Joseph Banks or any other number of<br>settler Invaders the world over to put<br>it simply the implication is that it's<br>okay to arrive somewhere new and overlay<br>a set of names onto the landscape based<br>on your own impressions of what's<br>important it doesn't matter too much<br>whether the places are actually unnamed<br>or whether the names are just unknown to<br>you you can embark on a naming process<br>based on your own PR private in Peculiar<br>interest in his Ro in his book The Road<br>to Botany Bay the Australian scholar<br>Paul Carter pointed out that cook and<br>Banks had quite different approaches to<br>their naming practices Banks was a<br>scientist and he tended to think in<br>terms of taxonomies if he was giving a<br>name to a place he would try to fit it<br>into a system of names making it<br>consistent with what he'd done so far<br> was by profession in temperament an<br>Explorer intended to give names based on<br>two principles wanting to please someone<br>by naming something after them like<br>Mount hkim the English name he gave to<br> or wanting to record his<br>impressions of a place like the name the<br>Bay of Plenty and I've chosen those two<br>names as examples because I was born in<br>fakat in that part of the country you<br>can see in Words with Note here that he<br>operates in the way that cook did<br>impressionistic personal gratifying his<br>friends how does this manifestation of<br>Cook's mentality<br>play out in woodworth's poems we can see<br>it in an example like a narrow girdle of<br>rough stones and Craigs in this poem<br>Woodworth and his friends are out<br>walking when suddenly through a thin<br>veil of glittering Haze we saw before us<br>on a point of jutting land the tall and<br>upright figure of a man attired in<br>peasant's gar who stood alone angling<br>beside the margin of the lake that way<br>we turned our steps nor was it long a<br>making ready comments on the site which<br>then we saw with one and the same voice<br>We All Cried Out that he must be indeed<br>an Idle Man Who thus could lose a day of<br>the mid Harvest when the laborers high<br>is ample and some little might be stored<br>wherewith to cheer him in the winter<br>time thus talking of that peasant we<br>approached close to the spot where his<br>rod in line with his rod in line he<br>stood alone where at he turned his head<br>to greet us and we saw a man worn down<br>by sickness gunt and lean with sunken<br>cheeks and wasted limbs his legs so long<br>and lean that for my single self I<br>looked at them forgetful of the body<br>they sustained to weak to labor in the<br>Harvest field the man was using his best<br>skill to gain a pittance from the dead<br>unfilling Lake that knew not of his<br>wants I will not say what thoughts<br>immediately were ours nor how the happy<br>idleness of that sweet mour with all its<br>lovely images was changed to Serious<br>musing and to self- reproach nor did we<br>fail to see within ourselves what need<br>there is to be reserved in speech and<br>temper all our Thoughts with Charity<br>therefore unwilling to forget that day<br>my friend myself and she who then<br>received the same admonishment have<br>called the place by a memorial name<br>uncouth indeed as air by Mariner was<br>given to Bay or falland on a new<br>discovered coast and point rash judgment<br>is the name it<br>Bears the critic David Simpson was the<br>first person to point out how similar<br>this name is to one of Cook's names<br>Point rash judgment with its reminder of<br>an impression of feeling associated with<br>a place chimes with many of Cook's<br>choices Poverty Bay cap farewell<br>doubtful sound words with them is aware<br>of this connection and writes it in the<br>poem not only in these final lines with<br>the idea of a mariner giving a name to a<br>bay uh but also in his first encounter<br>with the man which closely resembles<br>sailing up to someone else's<br>country so here is the first of the four<br>lessons I take when I as one of Cook's<br>people read woodsworth cook had a<br>profound influence on romantic writers<br>like woodsworth who in turn could<br>provide poetic ballast to 19th century<br>settlers for the idea that such Colonial<br>processes were Justified and perhaps<br>even morally useful as reminders of<br>histories but poetry is more complicated<br>than that and a writer of words with<br>talent and intellect is unlikely to<br>provide such a one-dimensional or boldly<br>political reading so let's look at<br>another of the poems on the naming of<br>places this one called it was an April<br>Morning Fresh and clear in this poem<br>woodsworth speaker has turned suddenly<br>into a little D in the course of his<br>walk and he<br>writes I gazed and gazed and to myself I<br>said our thoughts at least are ours and<br>this wild KN my Emma I will dedicate to<br>thee soon did the spot become my other<br>home my dwelling and my Out of Doors<br>Abode and of the Shepherds who have seen<br>me there to whom I sometimes in our idle<br>talk have told this fancy two or three<br>perhaps years after we are gone and in<br>our Graves when we have caused to speak<br>of this wild Place may call it by the<br>name of Emma's<br>Dell this poem approaches the question<br>of naming quite differently than the<br>last one and not just because the name<br>Wordsworth chooses uh doesn't have the<br>obvious cook like sound to it Emma was<br>the kind of poetic name he gave for his<br>sister Dorothy so he's actually talking<br>about Dorothy here but he names her Emma<br>and I was in the Lake District recently<br>and it's it's quite commercialized now<br>and um there's a crepe shop called Emma<br>Dell which Wordsworth would have hat it<br>hated the whole idea of<br>it woodsworth here investigates the<br>question of the durability of these<br>newly bestowed names at first it seems<br>that the naming process has allowed the<br>speaker to claim the space it is my<br>other home my dwelling in my Out of<br>Doors Abode but that confident<br>Proclamation that one can take<br>possession simply by naming is quickly<br>undermined by all the conditional<br>vocabulary and the little glimpse of the<br>future that<br>follows and of the Shepherds so a<br>subject section of the group of<br>shepherds who have seen me there to whom<br>I sometimes in our Idol talk have told<br>this fancy two or three perhaps years<br>after we are gone and in our Graves when<br>they have caused to speak of this wild<br>Place may call it by the name of<br>imell Wordsworth is very aware here of<br>the tenuousness of the name he's<br>bestowed and he writes that awareness<br>into the poem the name it seems is very<br>unlikely to outlive his own Circle and<br>more significantly the power to invest<br>the name with any kind of durability<br>rests with the locals not with<br>woodsworth and his family you can call<br>places whatever you like privately<br>woodsworth seems to say but you can't<br>insist that other people adopt the name<br>particularly those who have lived there<br>for centuries you can tell them which<br>name you use and they can choose to<br>adopt it but most likely they will not<br>granted any Authority in time those<br>names will just peel away and be<br>forgotten and he's right this has<br>happened in my lifetime I was born in<br>fatani I grew up in the shadow of<br>and fakar which we would have called<br>mount idim in white Island although I<br>have to concentrate quite hard to<br>remember now what the English names were<br>even Cook's name which we might have<br>expected to be the one that would endure<br>is melting away as alaki can<br>testify so here is the second lesson I<br>take when I as one of Cook's people read<br>Wordsworth he absorbs Cook's approach<br>and he provides poetic ballast for<br>Colonial naming processes but he also<br>encodes a necessary uncertainty about<br>the likely outcome of this practice and<br>can thus be read as cautioning the<br>setler populations who loved his poetry<br>not to imagine that they can insist on a<br>nomenclature without political or<br>Community consent and to understand that<br>any naming process undertaken in this<br>arbitrary way would not<br>endure part of the reason cook and Co<br>believed they could name places is that<br>they didn't really accept the permanence<br>of names that weren't written down the<br>absence of what Europeans regarded as<br>legible Maps signs and markers was often<br>taken as evidence that names simply did<br>not exist for those places or they<br>existed in a way that had no standing or<br>authority but woodworth's poems in 1800<br>challenged that idea in another poem<br>from the 1800 collection called The<br>Brothers woodsworth extends this<br>conversation Beyond place names and into<br>wider histories and knowledges this long<br>poem which is partly written as a<br>dialogue focuses on Leonard a man who is<br>returning to his native Native Village<br>after after a long time away and hoping<br>to find out if his brother James is<br>still alive he looks in the local<br>Cemetery but he can't decode or<br>comprehend the information there so<br>can't decipher whether his brother is<br>buried there he encounters the parish<br>priest who explains to him that the<br>locals use the landscape as a record of<br>their history Leonard then says to him<br>yet your churchard seems if such Freedom<br>may be used with you to say that you are<br>heedless of the past here's neither head<br>nor footstone plate of brass crossbones<br>or skull type of our Earthly state or<br>emblem of our hopes the Dead Man's home<br>is but a fellow to that pasture field<br>and the priest replies why there sir is<br>a thought that's new to me the Stone<br>Cutters is true might beg their bread if<br>every English churchyard were like ours<br>yet your conclusion wanders from the<br>truth we have no need of names and<br>epitaphs we talk about the dead by our<br>fir sites woodsworth depicts here the<br>tight connection between land occupancy<br>Community protocols and naming names<br>have to be brought out and used<br>recounted and recalled shared between<br>people and remembered if they are to be<br>meaningful records but as long as that<br>is happening there's no need for them to<br>be written down carved in stone or<br>inscribed on maps a community's<br>collective knowledge its sense of itself<br>its names and its stories is enough to<br>ensure the authority of a name and its<br>place in both history and<br>geography but this poem also reminds the<br>reader that this is not an automatic or<br>passive process the tragedy of Leonard's<br>experience in the brothers is that<br>despite being from this Village he can't<br>interpret it anymore the poem tells us<br>that he's been a mariner in a way at se<br>for 20 years and he's thus become so<br>detached from the place that he's not<br>recognized by the priest and has not<br>been part of the storytelling and<br>recordkeeping that has kept these names<br>alive in fact as the poem later Reveals<br>His brother James has died and Leonard<br>leaves again to return to<br>Sea this poem thus speaks to the<br>possibility of becoming detached from<br>traditional knowledge losing the ability<br>to read and interpret the names the<br>Landscapes that we did know or might<br>have known it's a process that par<br>inflicted violently on Marty and that we<br>allowed to happen to ourselves<br>but while woodworth's poem keeps us very<br>focused on Leonard in the tragedy of<br>both his bereavement and his loss of<br>connection with his home the figure of<br>the priest is a reminder that as long as<br>someone remembers as long as someone is<br>doing the work of using recording<br>sharing the names of keeping those<br>stories alive there is always a way back<br>to those<br>knowledges so here is the third Liston I<br>take when I as one of Cook's people read<br>Wordsworth he absorbs Cook's approach<br>and he provides potic bast for Colonial<br>naming processes and he encodes a<br>necessary uncertainty about the<br>tenuousness of an imported nomenclature<br>but he also teaches us as Cooks people<br>as parka that we already knew how to<br>Value traditional knowledges that were<br>recorded in stories and passed down<br>through oral narratives and that we knew<br>and were very fearful of the tragic cost<br>of becoming detached from those stories<br>by becoming detached from the<br>land wwith meditates on the tenuousness<br>of newly applied names and the great<br>sadness that comes from losing<br>traditional knowledge in part because he<br>does know what durable names sound like<br>where they come from and how they can<br>end endure persist and flourish in<br>another poem and poems on the naming of<br>places he describes sitting with his<br>sister-in-law Joanna Hutchinson and<br>hearing her laugh to Echo off a rock<br>that he ends up calling Joanna's Rock<br>but this is how he records the sound of<br>her laughter in the setting the rock<br>like something starting from asleep took<br>up the lady's voice and laughed again<br>that ancient woman Seated on Helm CRA<br>was ready with her cabin Hammer Scar and<br>the tall steep of silver house sent<br>forth a noise of laughter Southern L<br>heard and Fairfield answered with a<br>mountain tone helin far into the Clear<br>Blue Sky carried the lady's voice old<br>Skittle blew his speaking trumpet back<br>out of the clouds of glaramara Southward<br>came the voice and kirkstone tossed it<br>from his Misty head<br>Joanna's laughter rings around the<br>valley and woodsworth is able to trace<br>its progress as the sound bounces off<br>each of the local Peaks and<br>mountains the mountains all have names<br>that encode a long history of natural<br>observation some elements of the names<br>are old or Middle English some are old<br>nor some are the Cambrian dialect that<br>emerges out of Welsh and those languages<br>are sedimented like the Rocks themselves<br>containing a geological history of the<br>landscape they not only describe each<br>Peak but place them in relation to to<br>the landscape around them LG means a<br>ridge above a lake while Helm Craig<br>means a Hilltop above a cliff some<br>describe the particular appearance of<br>the peak how derives from the old Norse<br>word for Hill to Silver how is the<br>Silver Hill while skidor is from the old<br>Norse for a jut and Craig but also<br>implied the idea of an arches Hill<br>somewhere to station yourself skor is<br>the little spiky one that does look like<br>somewhere an Archer could fire from some<br>rely on very detailed local ecological<br>knowledge Helen probably comes from the<br>cumbrian words for a pale yellow Moore<br>which seems like a very strange way to<br>describe a mountain until you know that<br>local Shepherds used to evaluate the<br>quality of the grass on the Peaks based<br>on its color and because the snow<br>lingers so long on hin well into the<br>summer It produced a yellow colored<br>grass woodsworth can name all of these<br>Peaks and he trace the progress of the<br>echo of Joanna's laughter he doesn't<br>need a map of the kind that you can see<br>here more than that he knows the stories<br>associated with each of these names he<br>included a note on this poem to explain<br>the reference to the ancient woman on<br>Helm Craig that impressive single<br>Mountain at the head of the veil of<br>Grassmere is a rock which from most<br>points of view Bears a striking<br>resemblance to an old woman<br>cowering his poem records each peak's<br>response and understands the Peaks his<br>living beings interacting with each<br>other and with him and Joanna the<br>mountains heard and answered they are<br>endowed with pronouns that indicate they<br>are in woodworth's mind alive and in<br>relation with him that ecological<br>geological and historical knowledge<br>contained in place names is something we<br>as Cooks people might associate<br>exclusively with Marty names but that's<br>because we've become accustomed to The<br>Superficial way English names were<br>spread across these islands as Grace and<br>favor gifts to the patrons who never set<br>foot here or gave this country a<br>moment's thought or as notations were<br>fleeting and often misguided encounter<br>with a landscape by cook and others it's<br>not that the English language can't<br>encode that kind of deep knowledge it's<br>that naming practices have to be forged<br>out of a profound connection with the<br>land and its uses worked out across<br>centuries and Millennia aware of each<br>natural feature as a relation and as a<br>member of our community respect ful of<br>the uses to which it can be put<br>sustainably and generated through a<br>people's shared understanding of the<br>landscape stories woodworth's poetry<br>reminds us that Park settlers who loved<br>his writing and carried his verses with<br>them did have at their disposal and<br>understanding of what it meant to be<br>tangoa one tragedy of colonization is<br>that we didn't apply that understanding<br>when we came here and act in accordance<br>with the ti that tangoa laid out for us<br>so here is the fourth and final lesson I<br>take when I as one of Cook's people read<br>Wordsworth he absorbs Cook's approach<br>and he provides poetic ballast for<br>Colonial naming process you can tell him<br>a lecturer and he encodes a necessary<br>uncertainty about the tenuousness of an<br>important nomenclature and he teaches us<br>as Cooks people as par here that we<br>already knew how to Value traditional<br>knowledges that were recorded in stories<br>and passed down through oral narratives<br>and that we knew and were fearful of the<br>tragic cost of becoming detached from<br>those stories by becoming detached from<br>the land but he also provides us<br>evidence of what a deep authentic<br>relational approach to place ENT naming<br>looked like from a British<br>perspective the Romantic authors<br>understood this point Thomas DeQuincy<br>another great romantic writer who<br>actually lived in woodworth's house and<br>Grassmere after the woodsworth family<br>outgrew it um and thus also lived in the<br>shadow of these exact same mountains<br>wrote in his essay on style why are the<br>local names whenever they have resulted<br>from the general and good sense of a<br>country faithful to the local truth<br>grave and unaffected simply because they<br>are not inventions of any active faculty<br>but mere passive depositions from a real<br>impression on the mind on the other hand<br>wherever there is an ambitious principle<br>set in motion for name inventing there<br>it is sure to terminate in something<br>monstrous and<br>fanciful we have a lot of monstrous and<br>fanciful names to deal with in this<br>take I was born in fatani as I mentioned<br>and the place that cook called the Bay<br>of Plenty and the shadow of the mountain<br>he called<br>edim but when I was a teenager we moved<br>to Hamilton Nick wanted some stories<br>about my my life here they come we moved<br>to Hamilton and we lived on Nixon Street<br>the whole time I was living there I<br>genuinely believed that that street was<br>named for Richard Nix the American<br>president and that would be bad enough<br>in itself but the truth is actually much<br>worse that street is named for maduk<br>nion who led the 1864 Cavalry attack on<br>Angelia an unfortified site where Mari<br>women children in CA were<br>Sheltering it's one of the most serious<br>war crimes to have happened in this<br>country so when I read woodworth's<br>poetry from 1800 some of the questions I<br>ask myself as one of CO's people are<br>these do we as paria want to commemorate<br>the murderers and the war<br>criminals are those the people whose<br>names we think should represent us on<br>this<br>landscape do we want a city named after<br>John Hamilton or streets in that city<br>named after Mama juk Nixon or John Bryce<br>or George Gray or did our ancestors in<br>fact come to Alo with another way of<br>knowing another way of engaging with the<br>land with its traditions with tongoa<br>that we could have chosen and can still<br>choose I think wordsworth's poetry<br>provides us with a deep insight into the<br>park house psyche a psyche that was<br>formed in the Romantic Period our<br>appropriative and our acquisitiveness<br>our anxiety and our fragility but also<br>provides us with a reminder of our own<br>deeply buried protocols and knowledges<br>that could have helped our ancestors be<br>good treaty partners and could still<br>help us with that task<br>today woodsworth was poet Laurette for<br>the last seven years of his life from<br>1843 to 1850 he was actually a very<br>conservative Man by this point in his<br>life but he was still the author of<br>those earlier poems and it's really<br>poems like those I've shared with you<br>tonight on which his reputation rests<br>and those poems which would have led the<br>New Zealand company in 1841 to want to<br>name a street after him because he was<br>Poet Laureate of Great Britain he was by<br>default Poet Laureate of the new<br>Dominion of New Zealand from 1843 to<br>1850 what might the 1840s and Beyond<br>have looked like if alakia had engaged<br>more seriously with the Deep lessons of<br>wordsworth's poems What If instead of<br>choosing to be Cook's people we had<br>chosen to be woodworth's people what if<br>metaphorically at least we had decided<br>that we were going to dwell on<br>you<br>good evening I'm Sarah liot I'm the dean<br>of the faculty of humanities and social<br>sciences toah adui and it's my privilege<br>this evening to offer the vote of thanks<br>on behalf of all of us here to Nikki<br>Hessel for her compelling inaugural<br>lecture as professor of English<br>literatures at teing aaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington focusing on the<br>Romantic poetry of William<br>woodsworth Nikki's lecture this evening<br>has Illustrated why she is so highly<br>regarded nationally and internationally<br>as as a scholar who brings a fresh and<br>Innovative approach to the study of<br>romantic literature offering New<br>Perspectives on Romanticism Central<br>political aesthetic and cultural<br>preoccupations foregrounding important<br>issues of place cultural identity<br>community and fakap papa helping us to<br>see the relevance of romantic literature<br>to Paka history and identity and to<br>contemporary discussions in aloa about<br>the legacy of of our Colonial<br>past many of us here this evening will<br>have read studied appreciated and<br>enjoyed the work of the British<br>Romantics over the years we will have<br>understood that the Romantic Poets were<br>drawing on a different sense of physical<br>space and on different Landscapes than<br>those we know the English Meadows<br>forests and Peaks rather than the tasset<br>grass Fern and flex of<br>aloa that they were offering social and<br>political commentary from a different<br>physical and intellectual<br>world I suspect that few of us here<br>would have considered the close<br>parallels between the histories of cook<br>and woodsworth the deep circularity and<br>interconnection that Nikki has<br>articulated so eloquently this evening<br>the premise that Wordsworth poetry Can<br>Shed light on the actions of Cook's<br>people in the past present and indeed<br>the<br>future through her beautiful reading and<br>Analysis of four po poems Nikki has<br>shown us how Wordsworth poetry can be<br>read as informing our history our<br>contemporary moment and our future here<br>in this land weaving into her discussion<br>her own fua Papa as one of Cook's people<br>who grew up in the Bay of Plenty and<br>Hamilton the central tenant of Nikki's<br>argument at the is that these poems<br>offer us important lessons lessons about<br>Colonial naming practices about the<br>tenuous nature of nure<br>about the importance of valuing<br>traditional knowledges and the immense<br>cost of losing our stories and our<br>connection to the land and a reminder of<br>how Wordsworth and his contemporaries<br>understood a deep and authentic approach<br>to place Nikki's inaugural has provided<br>a space for us to pause and reflect on<br>these lessons she's drawn from her<br>interpretation and Analysis of<br>wordsworth's poetry and she has<br>compellingly made the case that these<br>are of continued relevance to us today<br>in<br>aloa I think some of us will go away<br>from this lecture and want to reread and<br>revisit wordsworth's work from the<br>perspective of our own identities as<br>Cooks people as Paka and consider what<br>lessons we might take from his<br>poems but there aside what I also<br>believe Nikki has given us this evening<br>is a moment to inhabit and absorb some<br>beautiful poetry read and discussed very<br>eloquently by a world-renowned expert<br>Tatu at Niki we're enormously<br>appreciative and extremely fortunate to<br>have you as a scholar and a colleague at<br>tading<br>aaka it's now uh my pleasure to invite<br>everyone to stay and join us for<br>Refreshments through uh in the hunter<br>common room but before we adour there<br>please join me in once again thanking<br>Professor Nikki hle for an excellent in<br>lure<br>Nami</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
