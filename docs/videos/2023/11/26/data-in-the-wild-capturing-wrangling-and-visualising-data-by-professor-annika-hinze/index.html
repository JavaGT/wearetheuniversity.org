by<br>Professor anakah<br>Hiner Professor Hiner is a professor in<br>computer science at the University of W<br>and head of the school for computing and<br>mathematical<br>Sciences she originally studied<br>technical mathematics computer science<br>and electrical engineering at the<br>Technical University<br>Berlin uh Germany and received her PhD<br>in computer science from the Freya<br>University Berlin in Germany she joined<br>the University of woto in<br>2003 her research interests include<br>location and event based system and<br>digital libraries who work in location<br>and event-based systems is concerned<br>with algorithmic aspects of detecting<br>complex patterns and data such as<br>detecting Hazard patterns in data<br>streams from forestry workers wearing<br>smart vests in dangerous work<br>environments her research in the digital<br>library field centers on the boundary<br>between algorithmic processing and user<br>interaction such as identifying<br>semantics of information modeling of<br>delivery context and the question of how<br>best to display information to the end<br>user her research often involves cross<br>disciplinary contexts in involving<br>colleagues and Industry Partners from<br>science geography education and malan<br>Indigenous studies she strongly believes<br>in the benefits of coll collaboration<br>coaching and mentoring and is<br>enthusiastic about the power of<br>Technology uh to provide good in<br>society ladies and gentlemen will you<br>please welcome to give this evening's<br>address Professor anakah<br>Hiner<br>Chancellor<br>man<br>pursue Excellence if you bow your hand<br>mountain now Tero naku Tero Ka I to<br>ewi with your food basket and my food<br>basket the people will<br>Thrive I picked these two fatoki as a<br>reference to attempting to solve hard<br>problems in research and to our shared<br>baskets of<br>knowledge acknowledging that in research<br>you never work independent or without<br>other people around you but always<br>collaborating and building on each<br>other's<br>work dear colleagues friends oh my God<br>so many of you<br>presentation I am originally from East<br>Germany a region called Berlin<br>brandonburg that is Berlin and its<br>surrounding<br>Countryside well this is Germany I have<br>to explain because I get asked really<br>often this isn't Bavaria no leer hosen<br>I'm so sorry um no October Fest either<br>um different sort of beer but definitely<br>also<br>soccer<br>my rivers are half an inch pre and I<br>bathed in one and repeatedly fell into<br>row my Moana is the Baltic Sea so that<br>is at the northern coast of East Germany<br>and most of our family holidays were<br>spent<br>there there are no mountains where I<br>come from so uh but you can always<br>plus when people ask me where I'm from I<br>typically say Berlin and I've lived<br>there for many years but I'm actually<br>from near Berlin from the countryside<br>area between high school and starting<br>University this<br>moment this is my grandmother<br>Elizabeth she had to leave school when<br>she was 12 even though she loved<br>learning but the family finances didn't<br>allow for her to stay any<br>longer when my mother Helga then wanted<br>to go to<br>university all the neighbors came to<br>talk to my grandmother and they said why<br>would you allow her to do that she will<br>only get married after<br>afterwards and my grandmother said leave<br>can my dad Jurgen was quite influential<br>on my career path rather<br>strangely because when choosing between<br>Pottery and<br>computers he<br>said nobody is doing computers in their<br>spare<br>time but you can always too Potter as a<br>hobby so with this excellent prediction<br>of how technology development would go I<br>duly enrolled in becoming a Apprentice<br>Sea I had then originally planned to<br>join the university in liik to study<br>cybernetics but with the change of<br>political system I ended up going to to<br>the Technical University Berlin where as<br>already said I then studied mathematics<br>computer science and electrical<br>Major I then spent a year in Iceland<br>working on<br>farms and coming back to Berlin I then<br>joined the F University Berlin to start<br>my PhD there part-time to being a<br>lecturer my PhD was on patent detection<br>and streaming data but I was also part<br>of a project that was about digital<br>libraries together with the National<br>Frankfurt in our information systems<br>classes we used Ian witness book<br>managing<br>gigabytes so naturally I was excited in<br>2003 when I had the the opportunity to<br>join the world famous greenstone<br>yato in 2009 I then went back to Berlin<br>as a guest Professor to the home World<br>University and have thus covered all<br>three universities in<br>Berlin like many of my peers I had<br>originally planned to stay only for two<br>or three years in New Zealand but at has<br>October this year the school of<br>computing and mathematical Sciences is<br>celebrating its 50 years of<br>computing currently I'm the head of the<br>school but I'm wearing a very different<br>hat<br>tonight I would like to acknowledge the<br>University of wado for joining three<br>others in New Zealand who have female<br>science in terms of career support I'd<br>like to particularly mention Ian and Pam<br>Whitten who invited me to Lethbridge<br>when I was on my way from Germany to New<br>Zealand stopping by in Lethbridge and<br>then looked after me when I arrived on<br>my own in New Zealand having never been<br>in the country<br>before I'd also like to name Margot Jeff<br>who was a very supportive colleague when<br>I was a young lecturer and the third<br>woman to arrive in computer science at<br>bado and lastly there is um Jenna Swan<br>who was an excellent mentor and who<br>it<br>so as the theme for my<br>presentation I picked data in the<br>wild to highlight the intertwining of<br>research and the real world whatever<br>that might be I will talk about three<br>projects relatively recent projects as I<br>guess that nobody wants to know about<br>technology from 20 years<br>ago and I will also highlight some of<br>the research done by my colleagues<br>across the<br>university the projects are from areas<br>such as digital libraries internet of<br>systems the first project is<br>URI in this project we aimed to find a<br>technology solution<br>for hazardous work environments<br>particularly the forestry<br>environment and because this one<br>particularly looked at forestry industry<br>the name of the project refers to a<br>forest this data in the wild that we're<br>looking at here stems from remote and<br>hazardous work environments in this case<br>forestry the rates of accidents and<br>fatalities in New Zealand forestry are<br>way higher than in other<br>countries that has largely to do with<br>the terrain because as a consequence you<br>cannot use robots there to do most of<br>the tree<br>harvesting it also means that most of<br>the people who work there are engaged in<br>manual labor so we have workers who go<br>for planting cutting cleaning and<br>walking each day the distance of about a<br>marathon so this is physically quite<br>demanding<br>work they work in and next to large<br>machinery and they have to react quickly<br>to any danger that occurs such as<br>falling trees or slipping<br>logs in addition the machine operators<br>Focus very much on the work ahead of<br>them but also have to look at the whole<br>environment<br>as they have to make sure that their<br>activities do not endanger their<br>ground the call or the challenge to<br>address this particular topic came from<br>Leoni pmer the previous lead of tikah<br>research institute as most of the<br>Mari together with Judy Bowen and<br>working with the range of colleagues<br>from across the university and people<br>from industry collaborators we received<br>funding from MB to explore a technology<br>solution for the<br>issue unfortunately at the time and<br>probably still no good data set existed<br>to analyze what happened with the<br>accidents what exactly when did they<br>happen Etc all of those<br>details however our forestry<br>collaborators gave us 10 years worth of<br>accident reports that they had collected<br>through the government's accident<br>reporting scheme so it wasn't quite<br>exactly what we needed but it allowed us<br>step because this data was collected in<br>the wild as it were not specifically for<br>our research it needed cleaning before<br>it could be used for<br>analysis so looking at the data we found<br>that really surprisingly a lot of<br>accidents seemed to happen on the first<br>of the month in fact at first it looked<br>as if a lot of accidents seem to happen<br>on Thursdays so we had this wild theory<br>for why Thursdays and then it turned out<br>that for these 10 years just by Chance<br>the first of the month was most often on<br>a<br>Thursday so most of those accidents seem<br>to happen on the first of the month<br>still no good Reas reason for that we<br>then found out that the deadline for<br>reporting any accidents that had<br>happened in the previous months was on<br>the first of the month so this is where<br>all the accidents got put into the<br>system in addition many accidents seem<br>to happen at<br>midnight why would the workers be out at<br>midnight well they weren't um again this<br>system um had a default value if he<br>didn't put in any time it would assume<br>midnight as the time of the<br>accident so overall about 10% of the<br>data we received had to be discarded and<br>was found to be invalid for a number of<br>different reasons such as<br>these so of the resulting data we then<br>looked at we found that 70% was work a<br>failure whatever that would<br>mean and if we looked at these ones f<br>we identified this kind of double Peak<br>pattern so most happen accidents<br>happened in the midday and the<br>midafternoon<br>and in looking at it we found this is<br>when the workers were most fatigued<br>right before their<br>breaks you might also wonder about the<br>length of their work days it looks here<br>as if they're starting at 3:00 at night<br>that's not quite true but not that far<br>far from the truth either the workers<br>have to travel each week to the<br>different parts of the forest that they<br>work in and they often have to start at<br>4:00 a.m. in the morning to be in the<br>forest by 6:00 or 7<br>a.m. that's why this length of work day<br>so because we discovered this particular<br>pattern we then started focusing our<br>fatigue<br>the way we thought we could solve all<br>the world's problems um at least in<br>2014 was per<br>having step counters trackers smart<br>devices you name it right so we started<br>in in that year um with this particular<br>research so we thought so could we<br>perhaps use activity trackers in<br>conjunction with um identifying When<br>people's reaction time is going going<br>down could we perhaps find a way to<br>identify fatigue and once we know that<br>intervene so we initially aimed at<br>creating a really good data set with the<br>help of students and a number of<br>researchers and people who worked in<br>forestry to have the first excellent<br>data set that research could be done<br>with well I can tell you now that most<br>of the data was not usable or not useful<br>at all but we spent a whole lot of time<br>on this so for example one student had<br>to wear seven different sleep trackers<br>and um with the result that in the<br>morning we found that each of them<br>showed a slightly different sleep<br>pattern and yes we also tried this<br>ourselves so it wasn't just the student<br>who were made to wear all of these<br>trackers um we had people wearing<br>different trackers on each arm to to<br>detect whether people had fallen over<br>just with the result that one of your<br>arms was alive and well for the other<br>one to be on the<br>floor so that didn't really work out<br>terribly well the different trackers<br>didn't really agree with each<br>other often in addition the raw data was<br>analysis so overall we found that most<br>most devices collect what is easily<br>measurable and not necessarily what is<br>Meaningful so they're lovely yes it's<br>perfectly fine if you want to count your<br>steps because it doesn't matter so much<br>whether it's 50 more or 50<br>less but not for the kind of research we<br>wanted to<br>do in addition we found that the workers<br>were not terribly keen on being<br>tracked guess that so it turned out that<br>their devices had suddenly difficulties<br>they were snagged on branches they<br>weren't charging they got run over by a<br>truck or they just stop working<br>miraculously for 15 minutes at 3:00 in<br>the<br>afternoon to the workers automatic<br>tracking looked too much like<br>surveillance and also they didn't know<br>where the data was going so they didn't<br>want to<br>risk we therefore had to change our<br>approach we rethought how we do the<br>research so instead of looking at these<br>particular trackers we considered which<br>technology might be useful in these<br>particular work<br>environments and what sort of data we<br>could give back to the workers that they<br>in so we shifted our Focus From the<br>technology as fascinating as that was to<br>the workers and their<br>families to do this we teamed up with<br>Nick Jessup from work safe who<br>introduced us to Forest workers in<br>Northland and we were also joined by<br>Anna Rolston and ARA Korina from the<br>Center for Health helped guide our<br>interactions with the workers and helped<br>us follow proper<br>procedure they also analyzed for us the<br>data following Mar<br>ramari<br>So based on the worker input that we<br>received in this way we then developed a<br>sensor vest an iot sensor vest that can<br>detect cognitive and physical fatigue<br>cognitive fatigue particularly applies<br>to the workers that are using the<br>machines and physical fatigue is more<br>ground so with selected sensors to<br>observe heart rate<br>variability and ganic skin response<br>heart rate variability means you can see<br>whether your body can still react to<br>changes in its environment whether it's<br>still flexible enough to react to<br>something that happens or whether it has<br>become rigid and can no longer deal with<br>whatever<br>happens ganic skin response measures<br>whether you're well<br>hydrated and hydration has a lot to do<br>with<br>fatigue so in addition we identified<br>fatigue patterns so we could then find<br>out whether people are doing well or<br>should rather have a<br>break we developed a vest that ideally<br>each worker would wear and um yes if you<br>think this looks a bit like a sports bra<br>that may have been the case for our<br>research don't tell the<br>guys we then also developed a body app<br>and a dashboard for their<br>FAO so the body app means that two of<br>the workers would team up and look after<br>each other body up so instead of their<br>data potentially going to the four<br>person or somewhere else they knew it<br>would only go to themselves and their<br>body and if the guys didn't want to take<br>breaks because they really didn't want<br>to because they didn't need to they<br>thought perhaps their buddy needed to<br>take a break so they could encourage the<br>other person and thus they would look<br>after each other because they knew if<br>their colleague isn't doing well it<br>might kill them as well because it is<br>too<br>dangerous the dashboard shows anonymized<br>information to the families so that they<br>could see whether the whole team was<br>hydrating enough whether they were<br>fatigue and how they were doing in<br>general so this way we can get the<br>families on board to make sure that the<br>work is set out in the morning being<br>doing we went to Northland and gave back<br>the data that we had collected in the<br>interviews and the insights that we had<br>gathered and um we also produced<br>something for the research Community uh<br>and that is an extension of the typical<br>software engineering process so in this<br>case bringing in Kap pamari and adding<br>in more activities such as more team<br>building early engagement with ewi and<br>acknowledging that there's always<br>end the second project I want to talk<br>about is called capisco which is Italian<br>for I<br>understand in this project we explored<br>the meaning of words not just looking at<br>the words themselves but the meaning<br>behind them and how we could use<br>that most data in<br>organizations is unstructured that means<br>it's not kept in any database or in any<br>way so you could evaluate it and analyze<br>it so that would for example be emails<br>tweets feedbacks received<br>Excel forms etc<br>etc this is often referred to as dark<br>data that is data that is not used for<br>processing most of the dark data is text<br>just by its very<br>nature and that is it is very similar to<br>these books in libraries where yes of<br>course we can read the text but it's not<br>not easily analyzed as they're standing<br>there in the<br>library even though their content may be<br>of interest to let's say Humanity<br>Scholars digitizing these books is only<br>the first<br>step so we explored now if solutions<br>that would work for libraries or digital<br>libraries could also work as an approach<br>data I let a project which was funded by<br>the melon foundation and which a number<br>of colleagues collaborated with the hay<br>trust the hay trust has access to most<br>of Google's books but also books from<br>other digital libraries they hold more<br>than 18 million books and they were<br>interested in finding new ways of<br>accessing their<br>content the books in the hay trust are<br>scanned books<br>which brings with it its own interesting<br>problems here for example you can see<br>the fingers of the scanner because the<br>first probably the first million books<br>they had were scanned by people now<br>they're using robots but problems still<br>exist because different type faces etc<br>mean that there's still a number of OCR<br>issues that is optical character<br>character<br>recognition<br>so as a use case let's please assume<br>that you are a Mari<br>astronomer like for example Rim matamua<br>the staran who collaborated with us on<br>this<br>project so let's say you're interested<br>particularly in the matariki star<br>cluster shown there Sur rangi told us<br>that he typically uses a list of 200<br>words each in English and in Tero to<br>search for to find literature that is<br>relevant to his<br>research so our motivation was to make<br>it easier for people like RI to find<br>those documents that they're interested<br>in so if you're searching for matariki<br>in the ha<br>because it also includes the matariki<br>turtle and the Mari New<br>Year and any other things somehow having<br>the word<br>matariki at the same time it is also not<br>enough as it does not look for words<br>like<br>pladis or the Seven Sisters so it cannot<br>look automatically for<br>synonyms<br>sides so our idea was now to understand<br>the context of the particular researcher<br>and to understand which meaning of<br>matariki they were interested<br>in so if we could now translate the word<br>matariki within this context into the<br>concept of the matariki star cluster<br>that would allow us to also know that<br>play yadis is one of the synonyms and at<br>the same time we could then exclude for<br>example the Mari New<br>Year so the idea is now to look for the<br>concept instead of the<br>word to do this we created<br>automatically a network of Concepts more<br>than four and a half million Concepts<br>that were interlined with more than 100<br>million links in<br>between which is not true because it was<br>100 million links in<br>between and then we buil a search<br>interface and uh a search machine that<br>would use this<br>network so there's two parts to doing<br>search one is what do you do with the<br>books and so with the books we<br>automatically recognized which Concepts<br>they were talking about by looking at<br>which words could occur together<br>we could have done something similar for<br>the researcher for the search interface<br>but there's a person sitting there so<br>instead we offered to say these are all<br>the concepts we have for the word that<br>you've just entered which one do you<br>mean you might now wonder that's quite<br>complicated why do you do this why<br>aren't you just Googling it surely<br>that's<br>easier the tricky thing of course is<br>that in Google it often assumes that<br>we're all very much alike which is of<br>course<br>true so they suggest the meaning that<br>most people have in mind working with<br>researchers however by their very nature<br>they often look for the meaning of a<br>word that nobody else had in mind or<br>very few other people so instead of<br>going with well everybody else means<br>this we actually rather ask which<br>working with the concepts means we can<br>also do search across different<br>languages because we're not bound by the<br>words we're looking for the concepts<br>words we can also analyze books using<br>the capisco system so in this example we<br>looked at two books from Charles Dickens<br>that's David Copperfield and great<br>expectations and we compared here the<br>use of the concept of<br>night and what it means is we're not<br>counting every time a character says<br>good night because they're not actually<br>talking about the concept of night we<br>only count when people are talking about<br>words coming back to the<br>beginning together with oakland-based<br>company Pinger we looked at dark<br>data and for example we looked at how to<br>support company<br>mergers we identified for each of the<br>companies which Concepts their knowledge<br>workers worked with and we could then<br>match them up so people could team up<br>and work together even though they use<br>concept<br>the third project looks at location<br>based data location based data is data<br>that refers to the location of the user<br>so that could be at the moment the gapa<br>the University of w Cato Hamilton New<br>now the name of the project has nothing<br>to do with<br>drinks I'm so<br>sorry it is a port Mano of two previous<br>projects that was tip and digital<br>library and if you somehow mush them<br>together you end up there this teaches<br>you to pick your Project's names more<br>wisely on the other hand it turned out<br>to be a really memorable name<br>so<br>this project was done in collaboration<br>with um fakat toia ewi it was actually a<br>long-standing collaboration before I got<br>involved in this particular project um<br>FIA is at the East coast of the North<br>Island in<br>utii I was invited into this<br>collaboration by Denny po who is the FIA<br>e development manager and by the CMS<br>Community liaison expert Alin<br>Yu the e was Keen for exploring mobile<br>apps to teach their Community about<br>history so we collaborated ultimately in<br>a project that was um supported by MBI<br>through a vision matanga capability<br>development<br>Grant a large number of the community<br>was involved in the project and helped<br>gather data and input data and I've<br>listed their names<br>there when we<br>started well and still the EV archive uh<br>looks like this so the EV archive is a<br>single room in which the community is<br>collecting documents about the history<br>and recent<br>developments however when we started<br>anybody who wanted to learn anything<br>about those particular documents had to<br>travel to apoi that is from Hamilton for<br>our<br>drive the e was quite Keen to not just<br>include information that was contained<br>in their particular archive but also<br>extend and include not just written<br>history but also Heritage Tonga and grow<br>its leadership in the digital space<br>face so we co-designed two apps there's<br>the W app in<br>Black this one showcases a selection of<br>the ews W the history who wrote them and<br>the<br>context the taku hio app leads the<br>community on a hio around the RO so you<br>can visit different places and at each<br>place you can learn about the history<br>and the customs of a particular<br>Hau at the close of the project last<br>month the E now owns several apps plus a<br>digital library with the history and<br>further information and this can now be<br>accessed by the community and<br>researchers<br>online of course under the control of<br>the ewi for who has access to their<br>data overall this project was driven by<br>Mar Mari and participatory design so<br>that meant weekly meetings many of which<br>were on Zoom particularly as this was<br>during the pandemic but also traveling<br>to opotiki whenever we<br>could we had many discussions with all<br>different members of the community and<br>hapu and of course always always shared<br>company using Linda Smith indigenous<br>research principles as a<br>lens us researchers learned about<br>mangari in<br>action for example the principle of hio<br>hi be a known face it means be involved<br>in the community show up and if there's<br>anything that needs doing you just<br>participate and do your<br>part also tiu fakar<br>Kuro means perhaps the hardest thing for<br>researchers sit back wait and listen<br>listen to what everybody else has to say<br>learn first about what the community is<br>interested in before you bring forward<br>your<br>ideas you can see here members of the<br>community as they set out to record The<br>W I know it looks like they're in a tiny<br>little room um they promised it wasn't<br>that tiny so uh so all these women came<br>together to record all of these<br>different W which means they had to<br>choose the collection of w which ones<br>they wanted to have represented they<br>researched the lyrics the translation<br>the meaning they looked at the composers<br>and looked at their<br>history and then they recorded the W<br>that they had<br>chosen Anita let the data collection we<br>had rangi Maria who designed the logo<br>and we had Denny Who provided<br>fako so a whole Community came together<br>to provide data for their<br>app the particular challenge for the<br>researchers in this project was to<br>ensure data sovereignty and that control<br>over the data and the app is kept by the<br>E I will not talk you through how we<br>achieved this with using the Tipple<br>software<br>so the community collected the data and<br>then entered these into the tiple system<br>via a<br>dashboard the tiple app builder then<br>does its work and creates an<br>app all the data is stored in the<br>database that sits in the E's Cloud so<br>they have full control over the<br>data the app has three RI that all of us<br>can access and and access for<br>downloading further V is controlled by<br>the<br>ewi the ReUse of the data is now of<br>particular concern because now it is out<br>in the open everybody could potentially<br>access the data so how do you control<br>something that is out in the<br>public we used TK labels traditional<br>knowledge labels that is markers on each<br>of the W and all of the data and the app<br>itself that would label it as property<br>of fakat<br>ewi the app and the labels are<br>registered in a local context Hub the<br>local context Hub was developed by Maui<br>Hudson and his team at tiah Research<br>Institute and the international<br>collaborators anyone who now wants to<br>use any of the data can see from the<br>labels in the context Hub who who they<br>need to contact and that frat here are<br>the people who need to be contacted<br>before you can do anything further with<br>the<br>data this is how this works for the W<br>app but the takik app takes it one step<br>further so on the takoy app there's also<br>data that is collected from the users so<br>as the community walks through each of<br>the different landmarks they learn about<br>the history but they can also engage in<br>traditional games so the app teaches<br>them to do traditional games and<br>encourages them to record themselves<br>singing or practicing the<br>games so this data is then collected and<br>stored in itage library that is given<br>back automatically to the community so<br>that they have access to all the<br>recordings and it will add to their<br>so the tiple project at frat here has a<br>number of<br>outcomes first and<br>foremost building and strengthening of<br>community ties across the E and the<br>university it has a dashboard for data<br>management and the W app I'm told is<br>being used every day by the ewi in<br>deciding which one to sing at the maai<br>or when practicing new<br>w fuya e is happy to share with any<br>other ewi what they have learned from<br>developing this app and collecting the<br>data so that other e can use their<br>knowledge and also create their own apps<br>so please do get in contact with<br>them the tacoy app<br>is actually more than an app so there is<br>12 Poe that were designed carved painted<br>and erected across the fak<br>to and as you walk to each of those Poe<br>you can then learn about the history of<br>the connected Hao and you can engage in<br>W you can find these apps and others<br>that were developed using<br>Store I've shown you three<br>projects which is hard to select from<br>all the different ones I've done over<br>the<br>years and um this word cloud now was<br>created from the titles and the<br>abstracts of my Publications from the<br>last 20 years and so you can see some of<br>the topics in there but lots of other<br>topics<br>also the topic of my data was of my talk<br>was data in the world and I hope that<br>you have seen that data in the world can<br>be quite messy and unruly and quite<br>literally can be wild<br>data but I believe it's also a really<br>interesting place to work in and to work<br>with this data as this is where research<br>meets the real<br>world<br>I'd like to acknowledge my students that<br>work with me over the last 20 years<br>thank you for your trust and for your<br>enthusiasm I'd like to acknowledge my<br>colleagues for being a supportive<br>community and the school and the<br>university who gave me the opportunity<br>to do this<br>research and I'd like to close with a<br>change of hats and invite you to join<br>the school next week at our Computing in<br>the par event in which we showcase more<br>you<br>I'm not sure I deserve that Applause<br>but uh taroto taroto C Co Jeff holes AO<br>um my job here is just to conclude or to<br>tell you that the formal part of this<br>evening has uh concluded um I'd like to<br>get you all once again even though<br>you've only just finished clapping uh to<br>to clap anaka for uh marvelous present<br>ation and and and the fact that we've<br>got a female professor at Wet finally is<br>celebrating um I I am the pro Vice<br>Chancellor for health engineering<br>Computing and science I am myself a<br>computer scientist so um I'm meant to<br>give a sort of brief summary of The Talk<br>but I find it quite horrifying um that<br>that someone would go out and ask people<br>what they wanted with technology um<br>rather than telling them what they need<br>um my own work tends to involve<br>computers I never see people I never see<br>and data sets I never collect and so uh<br>it was a revelation to me sitting there<br>listening to um and I could talk about<br>those three projects and and all of the<br>work that she does uh with people at the<br>very heart of<br>it and so that's a a commendable um<br>piece of<br>research spanning many years of course<br>and um um many Publications in in<br>journals and<br>conferences um I'd like to thank you all<br>for attending it's it's just a wonderful<br>turnout here I'm sure anaka appreciates<br>uh the warm support that you've provided<br>for her and the way the breadth of the<br>University that's here it's um marvous<br>to see<br>if you have and I'm sure you do have<br>questions um for anakah um then please<br>take them to the bar and and discuss<br>them with her o over a drink I'm sure<br>she'll she'll need one uh kakano thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
