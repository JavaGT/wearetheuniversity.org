I'm Payton Bond a teaching fellow<br>in sociology gender studies and<br>criminology at the University of atago<br>I've been a teaching assistant for<br>papers taught at ocf ataga Corrections<br>for the past couple of years and I will<br>be facilitating today's discussion on<br>teaching inside a prison environment<br>both the challenges and the benefits the<br>team here today are part of a pilot<br>program to offer University papers<br>inside tago Corrections Facility and<br>we'll be talking about their experiences<br>but first here's a short video outlining<br>the<br>pilot in 2021 in a partnership between<br>the University of atago and itago<br>Corrections Facility a university paper<br>the sociology of crime and deviance was<br>taught inside at TGO Corrections<br>Facility while prison students can learn<br>via distance in Alor New Zealand this<br>pilot program is the only one of its<br>kind where academics go inside the<br>prison to work with the students and the<br>education tutors since 2023 another<br>paper working with people the New<br>Zealand context has also been taught in<br>person at ocf today we're going to talk<br>about teaching inside a correction<br>setting and how new approaches are<br>offering important<br>opportunities we will be taking<br>questions at the end so those of you<br>online please send your questions<br>through as they arise and we'll do our<br>best to answer those for you along with<br>questions from our studio audience here<br>I am joined today by my four colleagues<br>Shane Fairley Sheree and Amy who I now<br>invite to introduce<br>themselves K Shane Walker um I've been<br>teaching at atago for 23<br>years and teaching down at the<br>corrections fac fac is one of the best<br>things I've done<br>k k I'm fairy Gilmore uh I'm a senior<br>lecturer in criminology and gender<br>studies here at atago and I coordinate<br>the paper the sociology of crime and<br>deviance which is one of the papers that<br>we're teaching at<br>ocf hi Sheree luki um practice manager<br>Education and Training for the southern<br>region so I support education and<br>Industry training around the South<br>Ireland prisons um I've got about 16<br>years experience working in<br>Corrections K I'm Amy BBE and I'm the<br>learning and interventions delivery<br>manager out at ocf and so I oversee all<br>programs in education that run on site<br>and in terms of Corrections I'm more of<br>a baby I've only been around for about<br>five years lovely thanks so much for<br>that and I'm very excited to be here<br>with you guys today I was hoping maybe<br>we could start with fairly in Sheree<br>just talking a bit about how this<br>program<br>began sure so um I started working with<br>ocf we started uh with a volunteering<br>program so some of the criminology<br>students were going out there to do<br>creative writing uh and I met Sheree<br>when I first asked about doing that and<br>Shere came to visit and was super<br>supportive and made that happen uh and<br>then a week bit later Chris Rudd a<br>colleague from politics had been<br>thinking about doing a university paper<br>uh at the prison and I went and had a<br>chat to him uh about what was planning<br>to do and he was like well if you<br>already have this relationship and<br>you're going out there why don't you<br>teach one of your papers so I had a ATI<br>Sheree who was very supportive uh so<br>Chris did a lot of the um helping to get<br>it started on the University side and<br>then uh on the correction side that was<br>Shere yes so very excited when biley um<br>um put the proposal on the table um to<br>have that partnership between the TGO<br>Corrections and their local University<br>seemed quite um positive um and yes so<br>much potential um for the Learners to<br>engage in the with their local<br>University so um I definitely jumped at<br>the chance um also um with the um<br>criminology paper um because it's a<br>study into um crime and the impacts on<br>society from the sociology point of view<br>um just saw um the benefits of the<br>Learners actually impact that as well um<br>and a lot of the Learners uh at at ATO<br>have an interest um in the social um<br>Services field um you know from a lived<br>experience and they wanting to help<br>others so um this paper also giving them<br>very good foundation um in terms of a<br>pathway to pursue that um as a<br>career and Shane how did when did you<br>become<br>involved beginning of Life last year or<br>just before that um FY and anaru came to<br>see me and said you're interested in um<br>doing something down at the prison and<br>usually I'm I'm down there visiting<br>people um so it was good to go to think<br>about something constructive and I I<br>think I said yes without even thinking<br>about it you did I just thought yeah me<br>and um and really really pleased with<br>everything that they had said up cuz the<br>the stuff that you know that I think<br>there's a room in hell for is<br>Administrative stuff and so all of that<br>was sorted just it just made it so much<br>easier and doable and I just had to<br>concentrate in on what I was there for<br>so thank you yeah I definitely it was<br>that was definitely the challenge in the<br>beginning because um you know<br>Corrections processes and um the<br>university process just for enrollment<br>um yeah it was like oiling water<br>basically and I do have to also mention<br>frto which there'll be a video around um<br>who's the education tutor there that um<br>did a lot of that work as well to get it<br>started absolutely we already trusted<br>Fred because um she was my tutor when I<br>was at un oh really<br>wow so it was it was just such a delight<br>m<br>and one of the reasons why um I approach<br>Shane is you know obviously because<br>Shane's awesome but also um a lot of the<br>guys had been talking about how they'd<br>like to do things like social work in<br>the future because they wanted to do<br>things that would help people um and I<br>think that's some maybe not a stereotype<br>we have a people who are incarcerated<br>but that's one of the you know key<br>things they wanted to do was to<br>contribute to society and help people<br>when they got out yeah that whole lived<br>experience um wanting to to help others<br>um is a common theme that is running<br>through and and when we heard that you<br>were interested um it was just like oh<br>well I used to look forward to it I mean<br>it was a busy life trying to plant it<br>all in but driving down there um you<br>know was just such good time to prep<br>and and also you know they've done the<br>readings for<br>times you know you're going there for an<br>intelligent<br>conversation um you also know that<br>whatever you're<br>teaching or discussing with them they<br>apply to their lives in that setting so<br>whatever you put together has in in my<br>view very real<br>consequences in terms of the way they're<br>learning um in that sense you know you<br>really wanted to be well prepped but<br>also and I think this is down to you<br>feely putting the paper into a package<br>that fits both the University<br>requirements and Corrections<br>requirements like the bits that you take<br>out because um and I'll call them<br>residents not prisoners because<br>residents down there don't have the same<br>access to things that students here have<br>and all that kind of thing and so the<br>the extra running around by um ocf staff<br>made it so much easier for us they every<br>time I turned up they had everything and<br>were well ready even when our system<br>didn't work and that's a really good<br>point and Amy and I talk quite a bit<br>about how um you know the Learners the<br>students actually see themselves as<br>students um which is you know it's very<br>very empowering um yeah wasn't that<br>great better to see yourself as a<br>prisoner well on that note maybe we will<br>now watch the video from Frederica who<br>has mentioned earlier so Federica is an<br>education tutor out at ocf and has been<br>hugely instrumental in making this all<br>happen um and she's going to talk a bit<br>about how people who are incarcerated<br>feel about having this access to<br>tertiary<br>education a first again working at<br>Corrections atago Facility in the<br>education when I took up the opportunity<br>and applied for a Tred position and sort<br>of um initially it started off teaching<br>one day a week and the rest of the time<br>was doing education assessments and<br>interviews but over time it's grown the<br>best part about the teaching and<br>particularly ocf is the unique<br>opportunity that the too team has<br>provided to our men in our care it's<br>unlike any other that theyve experienced<br>and I think they are in a very<br>privileged position they have you know<br>very direct contact with the lecturers<br>you know the experts in the subject and<br>the tuts and sort of that that's regular<br>it's structured you obviously care you<br>know create forums where the men can<br>talk about their own experience which is<br>very Broad and sort of um in a forum<br>when it's filled and their worldview has<br>meaning and they can discuss things in a<br>meaningful an academic framework and<br>they they're succeeding they're proving<br>to themselves that they can and they do<br>and they are doing it and that has huge<br>impact on their self-esteem it's been so<br>successful because there's been a lot of<br>work on both sides you know both ocf and<br>sort of Ana University have been very<br>collaborative and we have together you<br>know sort of overcome the<br>obstacles and um your delivery it's you<br>know sort of it's responsive it's<br>structured it's um accommodates you know<br>our unique environment<br>and it supports our individual needs of<br>our Learners and sort of um and you go<br>out of the way to make it accessible and<br>to help our students<br>succeed so they feel part of a<br>collaborative process and they're in<br>partnership with you you know they're<br>not aliens they're important students<br>the benefits for the Learners from my<br>specs is that they they love the whole<br>process they love you know sort of um<br>the lecturers and the TRS coming out<br>they love the discussions they sort of<br>um were industrious in the read getting<br>prepared for the discussions and they<br>had a forum when they you know could<br>contribute on a very meaningful basis<br>and their experience was very Broad and<br>seeped in New Zealand history was out<br>there in an academic medium that was<br>accepted as valid and real and they um<br>they succeeded you gave them lots of<br>support and sort of um and they you know<br>worked really<br>industriously and they saw themselves in<br>a new light they could achieve<br>academically and it was really rewarding<br>and so and supported their self-esteem<br>and sort of um gave them a positive<br>focus in present now I'm going to read<br>some of the comments that our Learners<br>have actually made about their<br>experience and how it benefited them one<br>learner said yes it has set me up for a<br>brighter future and has elevated my<br>ability to understand myself on a deeper<br>level plus understand current events in<br>society another learner said I've<br>achieved more than I ever thought<br>possible I appreciate the opportunities<br>given me to engage and succeed I found a<br>new love for learning I've been able to<br>learn things that interest and challenge<br>me and that's made all the difference<br>the Education team here is supportive<br>and helpful resources are really<br>available the feedback I have being<br>given as helpful and necessary my<br>experience here has given me much needed<br>Direction and a solid set of goals for<br>the<br>future thank you so much to Frederica it<br>was really wonderful to hear I wonder if<br>any of of our panelists would like to<br>add to what freder shared I know that um<br>Shane's already mentioned level of<br>preparedness which was huge for when I<br>went out with fairly um get just the<br>most engaged and prepared students I'd<br>ever had it was<br>amazing yeah having spoken with a few of<br>the students who have been able to<br>engage in both papers delivered out<br>there I think the biggest thing was that<br>they were actually engaged and part of<br>the education system when a lot of<br>people who come to<br>haven't been able to engage in the<br>education system cuz they felt like they<br>didn't fit in they felt they had so much<br>other things going on in their life that<br>they they couldn't put that time into<br>education and a lot of them kind of<br>think they're pass that point in their<br>life no I just need to get employed as a<br>lot of what we see but talking to these<br>men who took the leap and engaged in<br>this the the self-confidence that<br>they've developed that they can pursue a<br>University degree despite what's<br>happened in the past is huge for them<br>and to be able to be a part of the group<br>that was learning in the community at<br>the same time to attend lectures at the<br>same time to have those same tutorials<br>face to face that students on campus get<br>was huge and they got a huge sense of<br>belonging from that oh was the the value<br>in um being able to um track this at the<br>same time as Community Learners um and<br>it was huge U for them to watch the live<br>lectures um it was you know that really<br>um imers them into the student um<br>Pathway to even know that the other<br>students were sitting their exams at the<br>same time as them yes was a big thing<br>which you wouldn't often think about as<br>really mattering but for them it was<br>huge and the live stream is a bit newer<br>would you mind touching a bit more well<br>actually one of the good things that<br>came out of Co just one of the minor<br>things because um as you can imagine um<br>a a lot of things oh same as Community a<br>lot of things slow down and stop so um<br>but uh on the flip side um it increased<br>the use of um AV um so we already had<br>students at the time um enrolled um and<br>so using that as a platform to for them<br>to keep up and keep on going with their<br>studies um so that opens the door to for<br>us to think about well you<br>know why not so fair set that up um on<br>the University side of things which was<br>great um to be able to um f the students<br>to able to watch that um the lectures<br>live it was massive yes it was something<br>they specifically said they really<br>enjoyed and I would like say hi to them<br>as well I'd be like also hi guys when I<br>was good doing a lecture and the fact<br>that they were getting it at the same<br>time and I was saying good day to them<br>and um they could tease us about some of<br>our outfit choices and so on like it was<br>it was just nice um I do think the I<br>think the inperson tutorials has been<br>really awesome like I know there is<br>distance learning available and I think<br>that's really important but I think for<br>some people they did seem to get a lot<br>out of being included in the class of<br>having Shane and me and pton go out<br>there and run the tutorials and um I<br>think a lot of<br>people engage well with that kind of<br>learning where you can work on ideas<br>together and have those conversations um<br>and get be encouraged in that way to<br>like learn that yes your ideas and your<br>cont contributions are great um so I<br>think that was yeah aome and that's a<br>huge part of the University experience<br>as the collaboration during those<br>tutorials getting those new ideas and<br>New Perspectives so that they can<br>develop their own perspective is huge<br>and so it's really good that they don't<br>miss out on that and I think things are<br>only going to improve as technology<br>improves for people in prisons CU access<br>is always going to be looked at and<br>developed um it's slow it's always slow<br>but it's it's definitely improving and<br>that's only going to improve our<br>partnership even more yeah I I suppose a<br>point to make is that the guys were<br>watching the lectures but there were<br>like a week delayed maybe two weeks<br>delayed um being able to do that whole<br>process of um yeah the exchange um so<br>yeah it was a really um important um<br>evolution of um what we were doing and<br>the collaboration was awesome if if one<br>of the students understood something<br>more than the other ones you could<br>almost step back so they would talk with<br>each other and it was such a wonderful<br>part I think particularly of the<br>in-person part was that they could help<br>each other in a in a way that like they<br>had us there sort of you know if we need<br>to step in but they were really happy to<br>help each other which was really awesome<br>to see especially with that lived<br>experience when we're talking about<br>criminology and such they just have this<br>like awesome perspective that you know I<br>don't have and they were able to share<br>that and make that into something like<br>their essays reading their essays was<br>just<br>incredible I<br>think if people aren't going to be<br>involved in criminal Behavior what are<br>they going to be involved in and how are<br>they going to learn to do that and I<br>think that's what we're doing there so<br>for<br>me if you don't come<br>away<br>from that<br>setting wanting to be a better human<br>being there's something wrong with you<br>and I felt like that every time I left<br>there I'd get in the car and drive home<br>and<br>um just feel like I'd done something<br>worthwhile and that those men had spoken<br>something useful into my life you know<br>so it definitely wasn't one way no it<br>was um two-way conversations and and<br>often realistic hardcore to the Bone<br>conversation<br>um and<br>often not at the same level that you<br>would have them on campus Because the<br>stakes are quite different in an<br>incarcerated setting so for instance if<br>you're going to talk about power and who<br>holds power how it's<br>maintained um all those kinds of things<br>in an incarcerated environment they're<br>very definite and how they apply the<br>theoretical approaches you teaching on<br>that and also if they're rubbish you<br>know if they if they don't work they<br>might work theoretically but in terms of<br>real life they may not and I love the<br>way that they just launch straight into<br>that you know and so you would turn up<br>ready<br>for for kind of intellectual debate<br>intellectual fun um and these are not<br>the kinds of things that incarcerated<br>settings and I'm purposefully not<br>calling them<br>prisons it's<br>because every one of those<br>people has the capacity to make good<br>decisions we're all only a few bad<br>decisions away from being where they are<br>so what is it we have learned so that we<br>have made decisions that keep us out of<br>places like like that and so to me<br>that's the real value of the teaching<br>the real value of the teaching is when<br>they can construct a sentence and a<br>paragraph and do it well with<br>Logic the take home from that is they<br>may be able to do that with their<br>Partners they may be able to do that<br>with their kids you know cuz I see I see<br>this<br>as treat in them as fully human cuz when<br>you hear their<br>stories you realize how many bits of<br>them are missing and were never put in<br>there for starters and so again it was<br>it was just one of the the joys of my<br>week you know I on my way home I'd I'd<br>um usually start getting calls um and<br>people would tell you're in a good mood<br>and like go just just been down down to<br>visits of mates at Milton um and that's<br>what it felt like<br>conversations with mates as opposed to<br>me being an expert in<br>anything and I think the way that they<br>engaged can be put to the word<br>vulnerable and it's not something you'd<br>think about when thinking about people<br>in prison that they would be vulnerable<br>and let others into their way of<br>thinking their experiences and apply<br>them so openly with people especially<br>with when they then have to go back to a<br>unit but I think that the space that<br>we've created at ocf particularly freder<br>our education Tor and then the way that<br>everyone came in that you guys came in<br>and ran them really created a space<br>where it was safe to be vulnerable and<br>to actually apply these things to<br>themselves and I think then the results<br>speak for themselves and how they then<br>performed in those papers and I think<br>it's also the the the whole team in the<br>programs buildings so for the students<br>to come into the programs building um it<br>is a place of learning um so it's a<br>totally different vibe which is<br>supported by you know Amy and her team<br>um the whole<br>team well I think we've touched a little<br>bit on why this is exciting at least I<br>can pull out from what you guys have<br>said um but I wonder a bit more about<br>why it's so especially exciting and also<br>what are we hoping for in the future<br>because I think all of us want to see<br>this to be a sustainable and growing<br>project um maybe start with<br>Fairley sure<br>um I mean oh God there's so many things<br>about this that I think are very<br>exciting since why I'm so involved in it<br>um you know one thing definitely is you<br>know most most of the big studies that<br>look at things around desistance or so<br>on you know what stops people ending not<br>you know not ending up back incarcerated<br>um education is the single biggest thing<br>that we can do so to see more of it is<br>amazing<br>um like Shane said you know there's<br>nothing more exciting to me as an<br>educator than showing up to a tutorial<br>where everyone has done all of their<br>reading is so excited to be there and<br>wants to contribute which yeah it's a<br>nice thing um<br>yeah and International Studies do speak<br>for themselves when you look at much<br>wider scales much bigger projects um<br>Shere and I watched a video recently<br>where in the US 500 people have<br>completed a college degree program in<br>pres and only 4% have reoffended since<br>only 20 whichin it's huge and that<br>really takes out a lot of other factors<br>that you might think could contribute to<br>it so it shows that it might not be<br>education alone but that's a big factor<br>is engaging in education is a huge thing<br>and it widens up their opportunity so<br>much more when they get out to things<br>that they wouldn't even think about that<br>they could pursue in the future it<br>definitely increases their opportunities<br>and I know you and I are quite biased<br>when it comes to education and the<br>impact of it so but still you know<br>education provide provides them the<br>skills to engage uh in other programs<br>like the rehabilitation programs and<br>Alik so it really um enhances the impact<br>um of those programs um so it's exciting<br>across the board really um I think the<br>sky the limit really I I um I got kicked<br>out of half a dozen secondary<br>schools and um I'm currently in<br>associate professor at<br>atago<br>and and really at<br>16 I thought I would be going to jail<br>like all my mates but you know someone<br>took an interest learned how to read all<br>those kinds of things and<br>so if you're not going to be a criminal<br>then what are you going to be and and I<br>think this program is about what some of<br>them want to be you know um I had a<br>whole number of them asked me you know<br>if I do something with this does that<br>mean that um I won't be able to become a<br>social worker because you know I have a<br>a history of offending and I said no<br>that's that's not the case at all um if<br>you want to Define find yourself like<br>that that's up to you but the profession<br>um doesn't say at its door if you<br>offended stay outside in fact the<br>profession attracts people that are<br>putting their lives back together and<br>and I think that's again what this this<br>program is about these are the parts of<br>things that those young men never had<br>when they were kids you know even even<br>after getting kicked out of so many<br>skill<br>schools I was lucky enough to still have<br>the<br>basics so these men they're kind of<br>relearning the basics at speed and<br>applying it to their lives um it's just<br>magnificent but um and<br>I I'm not surprised that the recidivism<br>rate for people doing calls inside is so<br>low um that Stacks up with experience<br>I've had in<br>Scandinavia and in other parts of Europe<br>where and and we've been been warned<br>but whoever is in power for the next<br>whatever we're doing in<br>government please don't sacrifice things<br>like this this is about what people do<br>while they're there and what they're<br>going to do when they come out if we're<br>serious about them being fully involved<br>in our society fully as human<br>beings then we have to be doing things<br>like this you know and that's that's how<br>I felt my job was down there um and I<br>want to meet to the uni for letting us<br>do<br>it um some people would say it's a a<br>poor use of some very expensive<br>time um but actually I think it was it<br>was the University putting on its social<br>justice and human rights face in a very<br>real way so mi to the uni for that I<br>yeah totally agree with that um yeah and<br>in terms of um hopes for the future um<br>we've talked about this quite a bit and<br>it's something um we just want to keep<br>on growing um keeping strengthening that<br>partnership um you know and again you<br>know that partnership between the TGO<br>Corrections Facility and the TGO<br>University both in the same um area same<br>region uh you know having that<br>partnership um is really<br>important yeah I know that we'd love to<br>see more papers and there's plans in<br>place for more papers to come out as<br>well um and so for maybe anybody<br>watching along hopefully wants to take<br>their papers out what what sort of<br>advice would you you offer well firstly<br>feel free to come and chat to me if<br>anyone wants to take their papers out I<br>always like to talk to people about that<br>um I do I guess one thing we do have to<br>keep in mind is there is just always<br>less access to uh the internet and so on<br>for security reasons and Corrections and<br>I think that can<br>actually this is definitely not an<br>insurmountable barrier I actually think<br>it's been really interesting in terms of<br>teaching to think about what are we<br>trying to achieve in terms of our<br>teaching how do we do that with slightly<br>different resources<br>um and I think that's good for us to<br>actually reflect on our pedagogy and try<br>and offer those things in a you know in<br>a similar way with different resources<br>and do it really effectively um so you<br>just have to be a little creative<br>sometimes a bit Innovative and make it<br>work and sometimes technology helps us<br>as well like I make these dagy videos<br>where it's like looks like Twitch<br>streaming basically where you can see my<br>little face and you can see what a like<br>a Google Scholar search looks like and<br>so the guys can actually see how<br>searching Works um and suggest Search<br>terms and do all the those things so<br>even though we have limited technology<br>we can also use technology to help us<br>but I'd encourage anyone to just just be<br>a bit creative and also come and chat to<br>me and also know that uh the teaching<br>out there's like Shane said I think pton<br>would agree like it's always it was<br>always the favorite part of our week oh<br>yeah so don't I wouldn't be shy about<br>going into this setting it's very safe<br>supported and like the guys are<br>wonderful but it's at the same standard<br>and the same responsibility and the same<br>expectations as every community every<br>student in the community as well um and<br>I think that's an important point and<br>that's where a lot of pride comes from<br>the guys as well um the<br>flexibility um being creative um and um<br>yeah rolling with the challenges um and<br>it's that partnership um you know<br>communication between um all parties<br>yeah you can't say this but we can we<br>also want you your bosses to make sure<br>no no we also want your bosses to make<br>sure you can still keep doing what<br>you're doing yeah it's critical I I you<br>know do have to acknowledge um assistant<br>prison director and the prison director<br>um because they do support um they do<br>see the benefit of it and um you know<br>you know when I was in the role um yeah<br>had to run it by assistant pres director<br>U Renee and youve had to do keep in the<br>loop all the way through so very<br>fortunate have very supportive um people<br>on site as well well I've worked with<br>people who have come out of<br>prison it it's generally<br>the the mundane stuff that trips them up<br>like the paying bills paying rent um<br>going to buy<br>groceries um a whole lot of kind of<br>things that we would all just considered<br>to be normal things that we achieve<br>every<br>week um and I saw what we were doing in<br>teaching is giving them some tools to<br>deal with the mundane so that when they<br>come out they're they're very real and<br>and I and I think you're all right it it<br>did take a bit of refining from us in<br>terms of the pedagogy because<br>you got rid of Superfluous<br>fluff stuff that in other settings you<br>might considered to be academic holy<br>Grails um because you really wanted to<br>cut to the<br>chase with these men because of the<br>limited time you had with them so you<br>wanted to really make it count and so um<br>for some of them there<br>were yeah what I would call less fluff<br>less background stuff because it wasn't<br>needed and so you had to be refined in<br>what you were<br>doing definitely and in terms of like<br>those um kind of<br>teaching some skills I do think there's<br>something and this isn't just education<br>I think it's also things like performing<br>arts or whatever in Corrections there's<br>an element where it is a little bit<br>stressful for the guys like they're a<br>bit nervous the first time they have to<br>speak in the CHS they're a bit nervous<br>about some of the assessment um but<br>being able to work through some you know<br>slightly negative emotions in a way<br>that's very supported and the outcomes<br>will have all been positive they've all<br>done so well and are so proud in the end<br>I think that's really good to get to<br>have lots of those experiences and I<br>think that's what we really aim at ocf<br>um is to make that programs building a<br>place that is uncomfortable we offer a<br>really diverse range of programs in<br>education that are all designed to<br>really put them out of their comfort<br>zones and start to move move towards the<br>future a lot of being in present is<br>being feeling like you're stuck in one<br>place and you can't make progress in<br>your life but the programs building what<br>we aimed that to be at ocf is a place<br>where they start to make progress<br>towards their future and Shane touched<br>on something before about the mundane<br>things and not because they don't get to<br>do a lot of those things in present<br>coming into present a lot of your<br>choices a lot of your opportunities of<br>of your day-to-day what you can do are<br>are taken away from you but when they<br>then engage in something like this is<br>they get that control pretty much<br>entirely in their hands their engagement<br>and their great results and the progress<br>they made during their time in those<br>papers was entirely on them we we're<br>there to support them and the Education<br>team we're there to help them along the<br>way and to help you guys connect with<br>them but it's up to them whether they<br>study it's up to them whether they do<br>that reading we're not there with them<br>because education on site is what we<br>call self-directed learning um so how<br>much they engage is up to them and all<br>of them chose to immerse themselves in<br>it and they took that power and that's<br>just created more opportunities for them<br>in the future which is great absolutely<br>and I do want to do a quick reminder for<br>those of you online if you have any<br>questions to just pop them through for<br>us but I did have another question Shane<br>you spoke briefly about sort of the<br>University fronting up with social<br>justice for instance I wondered if you<br>could speak to how projects like this<br>like this pilot program uh speaks to the<br>the the Mary Strate strategic framework<br>at the uni is designed to create equity<br>and outcomes um for particular<br>populations I.E in this case Marty um if<br>you look at the<br>residence of um most prisons they range<br>between 50 and 70% depending on male or<br>female fale being Marty um if you speak<br>to Andrew<br>broft he will tell you that in his<br>former role when he was the head Youth<br>Court Judge<br>85% of um people who appealed before him<br>that he was<br>sentencing 85% of them had a been in the<br>care of um what is now or tamariki and B<br>had real issues with<br>literacy um and weird that literacy has<br>something to do with decision making and<br>logic and how we structure our lives and<br>things like that and so I think there<br>are some some much broader issues that<br>are up for grabs at the moment and and<br>again we're not allowed to speak about<br>politics but to me going hard on crime<br>means doing stuff like this<br>well this is going hardcore on crime it<br>is getting down there and getting<br>amongst them and learning from them and<br>with them you know none of us are any<br>better K up sorry no thank you um and<br>did you want to speak at all to sort of<br>how it might match up with corrections<br>framework and especially for the<br>populations at ocf yeah so we have an<br>overarching framework called hawkey<br>dangi which you might have heard of and<br>that is about providing opportunity for<br>everybody and bringing far no into it<br>making it a more collaborative approach<br>to support people on the<br>pathway into the future into<br>non-offending um and I think by giving<br>people the opportunity to participate in<br>education where we are embedding that<br>into what we do by giving them options<br>and by supporting them along the<br>pathways that they chose and bringing in<br>the supports that are able to help them<br>work towards a better version of<br>themselves with that we are we are<br>providing better opportunities for<br>everybody on our side by doing that both<br>them their family community yeah because<br>you know vast majority of the people<br>that we were working with will be<br>released so you know it's really<br>important work um that you know what<br>we're doing and what Corrections doing<br>so many different areas and um of<br>Corrections doing that um hard work um<br>to make those positive changes yeah you<br>might just be working with the one face<br>in front of you in the room but that<br>full their full Faro their full<br>community are behind them and that's<br>creating those little interactions is<br>actually creating benefits for everybody<br>in<br>that so we do have a couple more minutes<br>I think before we move to questions and<br>so I wondered uh fairly we spoke briefly<br>about sort of the digital access and<br>sort of how to get around that I<br>wondered if maybe you wanted to sort of<br>talk through more specifically that<br>pedagogy and how for instance you<br>mentioned the videos of Google Scholar<br>um and I know that we sort of have<br>shifted as as um the digital access has<br>shifted um but what that process looks<br>like to make sure that it is uh<br>Equitable to campus like how we do<br>that sure so I guess to me it meant<br>really thinking about like what are the<br>actual elements that we're hoping people<br>learn from each part of the experience<br>um and I think<br>uh the way I approach my teaching and<br>criminology is to take theoretical ideas<br>but apply them to current issues in New<br>Zealand to contemporary laws contempory<br>practices and I think uh the students<br>were very well able to embrace those<br>parts of the course often in Far More<br>nuanced and personal ways perhaps than a<br>lot of the students outside um there is<br>the element that becomes trickiest as<br>maybe understanding research um so<br>that's I was mentioning I might make<br>videos which show what the search looks<br>like get the guys to suggest Search<br>terms bring back showing them what<br>articles actually come up from their<br>Search terms how would you like to<br>refine those and honestly working<br>through those things in a little bit of<br>detail<br>um I think probably the guys got to<br>think through it a little more than some<br>of our students outside do like what<br>search terms you use what databases you<br>might use I did think that was important<br>to give them an idea of what those<br>things look like how they're experienced<br>um sometimes for example in the creative<br>writing group so not this not this<br>teaching group one time uh one of the<br>creative writing uh volunteers um got<br>the guys to do an exercise where they<br>had to practice writing emails and the<br>guys had one of them had never written<br>an email or seen an email so he had to<br>guess a lot so I do think it's important<br>to try and present some of these visuals<br>try and explain how the databases work<br>and so on um our Library resources I<br>think are very good and can be used<br>really well to kind of show like this is<br>what this database looks like and to<br>kind of show how these things work so<br>that's been really useful too yeah and I<br>mentioned and so that was a process to<br>often get to the for our course for the<br>essays at the end and again I said<br>earlier but it was just<br>absolutely uh it was such an honor to be<br>able to read those essays at the end and<br>see how they'd taken that sort of what<br>might on sort of paper look very<br>different to what students on campus but<br>really just become so similar and they<br>it so well and we so engaged and<br>prepared that these essays were just<br>phenomenal um and yeah just such an<br>honor and a pleasure to have worked with<br>them and to read those at the end as<br>well um does anybody else have anything<br>to add about just sort of um what this<br>has meant either out at prison or on<br>campus or out in the incarcerated<br>environment or on campus before we maybe<br>move to some<br>questions one thing I think's important<br>to touch on which Shere alluded to at<br>the start was I think the biggest impact<br>we've noticed on site is around the<br>labels so for sometimes for the first<br>time in their life they're seeing<br>themselves as something more than an<br>offender or a prisoner that they're<br>seeing themselves as a student I'm a<br>university student attending a paper at<br>the University of atago and I don't<br>think that the true impact of that is<br>really known I know in myself I was a<br>university student and I really took<br>that for granted what a what a privilege<br>that was and for them to see themselves<br>as a university student engaged in a<br>paper and achieving really good results<br>as a huge impact into their world view<br>and the opportunities they see<br>themselves going forward and enhancing<br>that critical thinking through that um<br>through the papers um and that then<br>expands into um better decision making<br>um you know evaluating an in having<br>Insight um in terms of making those<br>future plans decisions um really um yeah<br>the confidence that um the guys um you<br>can see um as they track through and the<br>pride and they do want to do well they<br>want to um ensure that they're not um<br>not only not letting themselves down but<br>not letting you guys down um because<br>they do um value and appreciate the time<br>that um that you put in um yeah<br>I really felt that<br>um it was It was kind of strongly<br>relationship<br>based<br>and even though I've visited a lot of<br>people in different<br>institutions it took a wee while to kind<br>of get that sorted to the right level<br>um I think the<br>other the other thing that I would do<br>differently next time is um I would do<br>the first session really on how to do<br>well in this paper how to be in this<br>paper how to be at a university do you<br>know what I mean I was lucky that the<br>ones I had had some<br>experience but there were a whole lot of<br>things that you take for granted in<br>teaching a paper that you cannot take<br>for granted with with these<br>guys<br>did you have anything else to add yeah I<br>think um just I think sometimes it might<br>look on paper a little resource<br>intensive because the class size is<br>quite small but I also think the more<br>guys that get to do papers like this and<br>the more it becomes just something that<br>others will see themselves as doing they<br>can recommend it to other people and<br>they'll be like oh this is something we<br>can do we can do University papers I<br>hope that it will grow and we'll get<br>bigger classes and I think there's only<br>one way to do that is by starting small<br>and growing<br>it yeah and it and I really hope from<br>this that more people reach out to well<br>say I'll say to fairly but really I<br>think to any of us um if you are wanting<br>to do papers it would be so so<br>incredible um to to keep keep this<br>growing yeah yeah imagine if we could<br>offer them a whole undergraduate degree<br>the dream yeah yeah might not away yeah<br>so bad idea yeah so keep keep working<br>towards that um cool so I wonder if we<br>should now maybe open the floor to<br>questions and answer any that we've<br>received online as well but I'll open to<br>our audience<br>first as like I see uh well we've got a<br>microphone here and then we'll move to<br>you next thank you everyone we<br>on uh thank you I that was that's a<br>interesting peek into a different space<br>for many of us and uh I suppose my key<br>question I have so many questions<br>actually uh but the fluffy Happ that<br>you're talking about that you remove<br>from your approach to educational<br>teaching you think that's had an impact<br>university it's made me<br>reexamine things that I've taught in the<br>past and teach them<br>differently because for some of them it<br>made me<br>Focus back<br>when when you're going going down there<br>every couple of weeks<br>and um your timetable changes just as<br>much as their and so having staff that<br>you can lias with very quickly and get<br>something sorted and so you might not be<br>able to do something at 4: that<br>afternoon but you can do something<br>starting at 8: the next morning which<br>means leaving to need that seven just to<br>ensure everything's right so because<br>you're doing things like that you really<br>want to get the best out of every minute<br>you're putting in there and so that's<br>that was I think how it's made me change<br>some things I want teaching here and and<br>so I'll sit down with the<br>person doing the bulk of the teaching on<br>campus and just go we'll discuss<br>something and then I'll go so what<br>because the men made me go so<br>what if that makes<br>sense and the other question I just<br>finished with was for the um for the<br>ones that step out in the sense they're<br>talking about uh improving themselves<br>how does that relate to those that don't<br>I mean is there tension between those<br>that want to be engaging in the<br>educational space uh against those<br>within the institution that decide not<br>to is there any sort of tension within<br>we will have this view of the<br>hierarchies Within These sort of<br>institutional<br>spaces it comes down to um Choice um you<br>know if somebody wants to engage in<br>education um we'll try um very hard to<br>provide them all the opportunities um<br>available um so um and I think within<br>ocf what we try to do is if education<br>isn't the path they want to pursue it's<br>if they want to get into industry<br>training will support them in that sense<br>to get them the qualifications they need<br>Beyond then um and people tend to<br>respect the spaces that they go to on<br>site and so if someone's not got the<br>interest in pursuing education then<br>that's fine we you don't need to put the<br>energy into that that's fine we'll put<br>our focus into the ones who do and<br>instead another person on site will pick<br>up what they want to do and so I feel<br>like we've got a really<br>good team on site who are able to work<br>to identify what each person kind of<br>wants to do and if someone's not ready<br>to do it yet that's fine we'll come back<br>and check in a few months and and if<br>you're motivated then then we'll pick<br>you up we don't close the door on it<br>completely um and I think that's a big<br>role of what our CHS do on site is to<br>come up with that pathway of what people<br>want to do and it's fairely touched on<br>um you know<br>you know students will encourage other<br>students on site so it's that role<br>modeling um on site that will um<br>increase that motivation uh to engage in<br>education or industry training I<br>completely agree I think it's um it's<br>such a it can be such a confidence thing<br>and I remember even just when we'd sort<br>of be grabbing a coffee and um you know<br>other people would be floating around in<br>the programs area they'd be like oh you<br>know like what are you doing what's<br>going on um and just talking to them<br>about it and they' be like oh that's<br>interesting like I don't know if I could<br>do it I'm like oh you totally could and<br>sort of just having building that<br>confidence and um Learners who maybe<br>didn't think they could coming in and<br>showing that they can and encouraging<br>others it's and I think I yeah I I<br>touched one earlier just if someone<br>understands a concept someone else<br>doesn't just watching that sort of<br>camaraderie there um and the encouraging<br>of each other and I think that that<br>extends Beyond sort of the specific room<br>where we may be teaching or tutoring um<br>to to wider into the program and<br>hopefully wider into the wider<br>institution as well k um yeah well thank<br>you so much for this it's completely<br>revived for me a vigorous discussion I<br>had with my son who's a law professor in<br>London and we were debating the concept<br>U and I said<br>U if you follow the real meaning is<br>restoring the balance and he said no U<br>just means revenge and I said you've<br>totally got that wrong that's what's so<br>wrong with the way most um first world<br>um<br>based um penal systems deal with<br>Colonial with indigenous peoples they've<br>lost the sense of restoring the balance<br>by building the person up and<br>they just obsessively stuck on the<br>concept of<br>punishment which I did an experiment in<br>my years ago as a masters in<br>Psychology in neuros Psychology and all<br>my r<br>were badly behaved and hated me why<br>because I was teaching them with<br>electric shocks and using it as<br>punishment and years later when I<br>reflected on that I realized how I<br>turned my rats into Psychopathic<br>rodents<br>K I think that's a a beautiful statement<br>um<br>if<br>we if we want people to function as<br>fully<br>human then we have to put some things<br>into them that make them fully<br>human when I was<br>12 my parents committed suicide<br>separately So within a month of each<br>other they both took their<br>lives as an angry teenager all that kind<br>of stuff stuff um there's a whole lot<br>about what pulls your life apart and<br>what you do with it how you react to it<br>and and that's that's why I had real<br>Affinity with those men in prison<br>because the trauma and just the<br>mongolz of their lives and the stuff<br>that they had lived with and walked<br>with and we expect them to come out of<br>there<br>and and behave as fully functioning<br>human beings well fully functioning<br>human beings only learn<br>that through a number of things and so<br>for me education was one of those things<br>and I I really do see those things as<br>fundamental human<br>rights not the human rights we can<br>afford I think it's socially just to be<br>doing what we're doing down in Milton<br>and um my hope is that every program at<br>the uni would consider it but if they do<br>they need to look in the mirror to make<br>sure they're the right kind of humans to<br>be in that<br>context cuz those men need loving and<br>caring for and what we speak and the<br>looks in our faces and in the tone we<br>take they don't need anything else<br>they've had enough of<br>that we had that not only you know with<br>the people who are going out but um for<br>instance the administrators in our<br>program who would go above and beyond to<br>print out certificates of completion and<br>put them on nice paper and um lovingly<br>bind everything and they who would never<br>meet the Learners out um at ocf but<br>wanted to do right by them um and that<br>was that's been really important to<br>everyone involved and it's meant a lot<br>it's meant a lot um to every to everyone<br>who's been involved and I really yeah<br>I'm excited to keep seeing it grow um<br>we've got about five more minutes so<br>maybe time for one more<br>question maybe one one or two if we have<br>some I don't think we have any online a<br>word from<br>hi<br>dinking is dinking<br>thinking all is<br>thinking teaching thinking you are<br>teaching<br>all uh oh we've got one more question<br>there pass it back thank you hi um I'm a<br>librarian here at the University and I<br>was just we love you yes thank you thank<br>you I was just wondering um what kind of<br>support staff around the unity univers<br>are involved with this if any could you<br>tell me a little bit about<br>that sure um so the administrative staff<br>have been incredibly helpful in around<br>like the student support and so on in<br>terms of enrollment uh I think Sheree<br>saying oil and water earlier was very<br>accurate we just have two very different<br>systems and while the overarching<br>attitude has been like this is a good<br>pilot keep doing it um the systems just<br>don't interact so we've had<br>administrative people get very creative<br>making those things interact as pton was<br>saying um our in Department in program<br>uh admin support has been amazing making<br>sure everything's just like nicely done<br>and bound and prepared in advance um in<br>terms of access obviously the guys don't<br>actually have access to the library<br>resources so um one of the great things<br>is how well the library things like say<br>for criminology as a subject guide and<br>so on on the library set up it makes it<br>really easy for me to film those things<br>and kind of show what what university<br>resources will look like um but those<br>reasons let's see any more okay well<br>maybe we will wrap it up there um<br>because we are running out of time so<br>thank you again to our studio audience<br>um for attending this discussion today<br>and also thank you so much for those of<br>you who have attended online um it is<br>it's been really great to be able to<br>talk about this today and and um even<br>even if you didn't have questions now if<br>you have any in the future please uh<br>feel free to reach out to to us we would<br>be very very happy to receive those um<br>Amy Fairley Sheree and Shane thank you<br>so much for sharing your insights and<br>experiences on tertiary education in the<br>prison settings I'd also like to thank<br>the committee for the advancement of<br>learning and teaching for creating this<br>opportunity for us to discuss these<br>important issues and to ocf for<br>supporting this Mahi and thank you also<br>to the lovely media Productions team for<br>producing this live broadcast and<br>helping us look in the right direction<br>hopefully um so thank you so much for<br>coming today and for engaging with us we<br>really appreciate your time and and
