listening thank<br>you thank you I want to know a bit about<br>mobad because I happen to know about it<br>but I think lots of people might not<br>know what mobad is what how it came to<br>be how it became so popular and it<br>started in your head Within and with<br>your hair I believe it's started with my<br>hair actually yes well you mentioned I<br>was a former poet Laurer and my tenure<br>was from 2017 to<br>2019 and um it it was a wonderful<br>surprise I didn't know much about the<br>the role of poet laurate even though it<br>had been around since<br>1996 our first laurate was Bill manhire<br>I knew nothing about the story really<br>and I thought that's quite surprising<br>giving that I'm an academic in an<br>English Department so if I don't know<br>much about it how does everybody else<br>know anything about it um it is New<br>Zealand's highest monetary award for<br>being a poet they are taxpayer dollars<br>and I just thought the community needs<br>to know that this belongs to them after<br>all they're funding it and so I thought<br>at the end of my tenure the usual<br>way um that lauret ends their tenure<br>ship is to have a book of poems<br>published kind of you know an overview<br>of the last two years and and the brief<br>is very loose so it could just be<br>whatever they like to write about or<br>about being laurat in New Zealand and<br>elsewhere and I thought I wanted to tell<br>the story of how I was or became the<br>11th poet laurate the first Pacifica<br>poet laurate the second uh youngest poet<br>laurate and the fifth woman poet laurate<br>and to kind of marry all those um things<br>together and what that meant for the<br>role for me um I've I'm actively in<br>schools a lot um and that the reason why<br>I'm in schools a lot is in that first<br>mophead book but the idea of telling the<br>story about the Laurette ship through<br>this kind of cre ative graphic Memoir<br>medium um came about when I experienced<br>in my body um the the the narrative Arc<br>of the story and um when I was at the<br>investure ceremony at matahi marai in<br>2017 um when Jacob Scott the kava the M<br>Carver who carves each lauriat their own<br>walking stick or too Taco which it's<br>also a a Talking Stick and he carves it<br>to reflect their Aesthetics their<br>experience who they are and when he<br>unveiled mine um he had put a fuer or a<br>samon um talking Chief's fly Whisk on<br>the top of it and so when he revealed it<br>I saw this huge walking stick carved<br>with my story with this huge mop of um<br>coconut cinate fibers and I also saw a<br>mop and it took me back all the way to<br>when I was eight and at avendelle<br>primary school and teased you know<br>teased for being a mop head with someone<br>you know for someone with massive unruly<br>hair that I couldn't quite control and<br>it was a really that that was my moment<br>it was an epiphany it's like oh so how<br>did I get from being this you know<br>afakasi this mixed blooded young girl in<br>a very Multicultural school I was you<br>know I am s moreal in Scottish French<br>and English with crazy ha to you know<br>occupying this most prestigious role of<br>being the New Zealand Po laurate and um<br>I just told the story through mophead<br>and she's um one out of the box it was a<br>way also to honor how I was inspired<br>first um by the<br>possibilities that poetry held for me in<br>terms of giving myself a voice when I<br>felt like I didn't have one and in mop<br>head I talk about you know our um<br>informal New Zealand poet laurate um our<br>New Zealand bad Sam Hunt who has<br>influenced generations of people all<br>shapes sizes classes and colors and<br>Creeds everyone um you know you you<br>would have had to just simply not been<br>here in the late' 607s<br>not know about hunt and so it's also an<br>homage to<br>him but because he came into my school<br>and at the time I was<br>10 um I just thought I need to do that I<br>need to pay it forward and so my service<br>for the University includes College you<br>know college kids you know<br>prospective uh University and<br>rool but really the emphasis is on that<br>really young stage of transformation and<br>transition at school planting the seeds<br>early you know with kids in primary<br>school and intermediate because that's<br>when I saw the possibility and I just<br>wanted to pay it forward and you really<br>did how did you decide to illustrate it<br>yourself because I guess it's one thing<br>to write it that's your thing that's<br>what you're trained to do and what<br>people might expect you to do even in a<br>different kind of medium I guess to<br>poetry um but you you've created an<br>entire Persona of mophead that is just<br>and all of the her world that has just<br>sort of Enchanted people and and I can<br>see why why why it has but how did you<br>decide you were going to be the one to<br>to draw it I you know it sounds like one<br>of those kind of Mythic Beginnings but I<br>woke up in bed with the idea and wanted<br>to get things down as quickly as<br>possible so I grabbed my journal and I<br>just just roughly sketched out and<br>storyboarded from beginning to end and<br>you know when the Muse hits you you you<br>should not interrupt or do anything to<br>disrupt the flow and so it was I I<br>quickly sketched it in these tiny<br>thumbnail sketches across maybe 10 pages<br>in my journal until I got to the end<br>because I knew I I had to begin with the<br>mop and end with the too taco and it was<br>my way of kind of sorting out The<br>Narrative very quickly I didn't want to<br>get bogged down into writing this kind<br>of plot driven linear piece I wanted to<br>um quickly get down the inspirational<br>parts of the story uh because like many<br>of my colleagues I do tend to<br>overwrite and I I didn't want to lose<br>the kind of Life essence of it um so<br>illustration was the thing that that got<br>you there just having to encapsulate it<br>in in a pict<br>yeah I got there faster with with the<br>picture than the words and then I was<br>also experimenting with different ways<br>of personal organization and I had an<br>iPad that I was um kind of wanting to<br>figure out how do I plan my life between<br>paper because I I I love planning on<br>paper but I also you know we're all<br>device driven now and we get sent<br>electronic invitations and they can be<br>slotted in and I was just kind of trying<br>to figure out how how I can maximize<br>this iPad and then I discovered that it<br>could draw and so I thought oh well why<br>don't I just take from paper to digital<br>screen and and begin drawing this so I<br>didn't have to start over again I could<br>just kind of put another layer on it<br>bury another layer like it it's really<br>easy and I just I bought an app called<br>procreate for 50 bucks it's the same one<br>that I use now it's I just I I love it<br>to bits it doesn't require ongoing<br>subscription fees or anything but I took<br>that very rough iPad um version of mop<br>head to um my publisher Sam alw worthy<br>um from Oakland University press yes and<br>I was actually there on other business I<br>had um just completed maybe a 60,000<br>word Memoir of my poet laurate Journey<br>um and there are 11 kind of short<br>stories almost flash long flash fiction<br>I know that sounds like<br>kind of a paradox but um based on each<br>of the 11 parts of the too too and so he<br>he um loved the idea and wanted me to<br>keep developing it and so we're all kind<br>of getting ready to sort out a book<br>contract for the Memoir um tentatively<br>titled too too Tales from the tusy tala<br>too much literation I know and then I<br>was at the you know just about to leave<br>and I was at the door ltil and I turned<br>around and I said oh Sam do you want to<br>see something crazy I've been working on<br>and he was like oh yeah come on back and<br>sit down and so I pulled out mop head<br>the first version of it and it was so<br>crazy and so um genre bending that it<br>really intrigued him and he went you<br>know what this is this is this is kind<br>of like capturing the Zeitgeist of this<br>nation at the moment you know we were<br>yeah it just seemed so<br>quirky and<br>bespoke and um jusa Arden was in her<br>term as being our first prime minister<br>first of her kind and he's like let's<br>let's go with this it's kind of like a<br>moppy girl power thing let's let's let's<br>see where it takes us and so I parked<br>the Memoir and began working on mophead<br>the first one yeah I bet he was so glad<br>he said that cuz you've been his biggest<br>one of his biggest sellers haven't you<br>yeah well when it you know it it it took<br>out a number of awards but my favorite<br>one of course is the Margaret Mahi<br>Supreme book award and Margaret Mahi is<br>is children's literature in this country<br>her her fantastic Tales bizarre and um<br>so captivating of children's<br>imaginations um but yeah this this<br>occupation of being what I've now kind<br>of written critically as an academic<br>about um you know this role of occupying<br>the artist academic it's the artist<br>staish academic and the staish looks<br>like an estx but the starfish is<br>actually taken from my one of my tattoo<br>symbols um and in in sour tattoo<br>symbology the starfish oh sorry the<br>jellyfish uh represents woman and um<br>only women May wear it or have it<br>tattooed on their body and when I asked<br>my tattooist why why is this she said<br>well that you know the jellyfish is<br>beautiful to behold but deadly have<br>stood on this particular jellyfish right<br>and so I thought oh yeah that's that<br>belongs in the artist jellyfish academic<br>role where um I do a lead by<br>line PR well I call it a lead by line<br>practice where I combine the spoken line<br>the written line the drawn line with the<br>bloodline and the land line to create<br>these these decolonial spaces of<br>empowerment by just simply telling our<br>Tales you know using all of our lines<br>that's what moped is yeah and it really<br>has reached out to so many people um<br>because theas have a copy do they well<br>they have book one and too wow cuz the<br>second mop head um kind of carried on<br>that theme we'll get to the third one in<br>a second um the second one was all about<br>your trip to see the queen is that right<br>and um which was exciting thing in<br>itself that some people might not know<br>about so before I was Commonwealth part<br>uh New Zealand part La I was the<br>Commonwealth part for 2016 and with that<br>role came up um I was commissioned to um<br>write and perform a palm for her majesty<br>at Westminster Abby for Commonwealth<br>observance day and uh so mop head<br>2 um T being spelled Tu which is the<br>moldi word and the samon word for stand<br>um Tells A Tale of what that involved<br>being from a former colonized Nation<br>Nations both altero and S and tuvalu um<br>what it means to stand in that you know<br>the heart of the British Empire and<br>serve the queen like you know yeah trick<br>tricky it's a tricky tension tricky<br>tension and tricky politics actually um<br>but I decided to better to represent and<br>be in this creative space um and be a<br>bridge you know the last three letters<br>of t tala my grandfather's name is Allah<br>which is the protop Polynesian word for<br>bridge or pathway that connecting thing<br>between two things um and I use<br>creativity to kind of embolden and<br>Empower and enrich that space so mop to<br>I've dubbed um colonialism 101 for<br>kids so and and um teachers love it you<br>know the feedback that I've received<br>from teachers is is that it equates you<br>know kids know about bullying they know<br>about the theme of bullying through mop<br>head they know about bullying in their<br>own lives and then they can see how<br>colonialism was a form of bullying of<br>unequal power relationships between two<br>sets of people or more yeah you kind of<br>got the last laugh on that one though<br>didn't you you were the one standing in<br>that space um speaking<br>yeah opening up opening up the<br>conversation yeah which which has led to<br>um among other things an invitation to<br>uh Buckingham Palace I'll be in<br>Edinburgh doing some research work on<br>Robert Louis Stevenson um my namesake<br>and um so I get to fly there and uh be<br>hosted by Queen Camila for uh the<br>Commonwealth um essay competition one of<br>the longest or the they they say they<br>the longest essay competition in the<br>Commonwealth of course they are<br>there's 40 um different peoples<br>represented in the in the competition<br>and I get to be part of that Awards<br>that's exciting yeah yeah your royalty<br>connections continue isn't it amazing in<br>mop too there is that scene with Harry<br>and Megan um yeah where Harry Stomps my<br>too Taco on the ground in a playful<br>manner and you know it says You shall<br>not pass you know AKA Lord of the Rings<br>and Gandalf famous lines and that stuck<br>in my head just like the mop that there<br>was there was something there there was<br>that that that moment of yeah you're you<br>are joking and it is funny but it isn't<br>as well and it's so not funny it's not I<br>think we have to get on to the final one<br>now which is what not you got and that's<br>a bit different it's a bit of a<br>departure in terms of its style um in<br>terms of how kids or other people can<br>use it isn't it it looks different it's<br>it's pretty cool yes yes well since mop<br>came out I've been going into schools<br>even more I mean I went into schools as<br>a poet before that because they could<br>take several boxes with me I was you<br>know an academic a representative of the<br>University I was a woman I was brown I<br>was a poet I was accessible so you know<br>um uh always a big presence in schools<br>and I just started getting questions<br>from kids um as Mo head and so I'd get<br>these notes asking things from you know<br>dear Dr mop head how do I know my poem<br>is good all the way to Dear Dr mop head<br>how do I know I am<br>good and the questions got kind of<br>deeper and deeper and I just they were<br>so precious to me that I just collected<br>them all and after 2 years I had about 2<br>and a half thousand scrap Bits of Paper<br>Post-it notes ripped out refill notes<br>from kids just um asking me stuff and I<br>took 11 of those what I felt were<br>representative knots and put them in<br>this book and devised naughty naughty<br>creative writing and drawing exercises<br>to help them loosen their knots you know<br>and of course it's couched in my own Big<br>Knot because kids knots you know kids<br>knots are adults knots and vice versa as<br>well yeah they tend to kind of create<br>and cause each other a bit don't and I<br>think the sweet spot with what what you<br>got my pid's Guide to Life Is I'm<br>vulnerable in it because these kids have<br>given me the gift of their own<br>vulnerability it's um it's a very funny<br>and Charming book I've just had a look<br>at it it's got some really cute little<br>characters in it I like the yeti not yet<br>or Yeti is that that is that something<br>you said because it's all in rhyme as<br>well isn't it it's all in Dr Zeus very<br>Dr Zeus yeah were you inspired by Dr<br>Zeus absolutely absolutely Ely yes and<br>Spike Milligan and Spike Milligan but I<br>thought you know you know in the<br>leadership sector you know and and<br>professional development we learn about<br>things like growth mindset and it's like<br>well you know I think Carol D's growth<br>mindset which is I can't do this yet you<br>know and I thought well kids need to<br>know that too and they need to know in a<br>quirky way not a kind of serious somber<br>way so I invented the monster yeti with<br>his spaghetti yeah it's lovely and how<br>can people get hold of it I'm sure<br>people will want to because it's just<br>coming up to Christmas oh absolutely and<br>there's going to be lots of people that<br>want to see that under their trees all<br>they have to do is Google mophead<br>Selena if they don't put the Selena<br>there they'll end up somewhere like<br>Plumbing<br>world so mop head and getting a<br>different kind of mop yeah oh that's<br>great hey thank you so much for talking<br>to us and um I wish you all the best<br>with that book what's next next can we<br>quickly say is there anything I'm going<br>to finish that Memoir good I'm going to<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
