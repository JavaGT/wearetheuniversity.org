accurate.</p><p>for<br>Hal<br>I<br>care<br>gato uh my name is John hosking I'm den<br>of science here at the University of<br>Oakland by Papa tamatar and welcome to<br>the inaugural lecture of Professor<br>Kerrie looms and a special welcome to<br>K's F who I see down the front<br>here uh and as somebody whose uh<br>ancestry DNA analysis informs me is 50%<br>cultish I thoroughly approve of the<br>start of the ceremony tonight so thank<br>you for<br>that K was born and raised near wanganui<br>did a PhD in chemistry at Massie before<br>a postto at the Carolin Institute in<br>Sweden was then lured back to New<br>Zealand here in ockland as a postto then<br>HRC postto then lecturer while working<br>halftime for eight years of his career<br>with biotech spin out spinout pmics and<br>also progressing through the academic<br>ranks in biological<br>sciences car's work is mostly in<br>interdisciplinary across different<br>spheres such as Medicinal Chemistry<br>structural biology and Drug Discovery<br>and<br>development as close to 100 academic<br>Publications are impactful appearing in<br>Top Rank venues such as p and angat Kim<br>Kim but uh industry languages and<br>Commercial impact have continued to be a<br>strong feature of K's work both in his<br>research where he has eight patents<br>recognized and is director of The<br>Institute for Innovation and<br>biotechnology and in his teaching where<br>he is director of the bioscience<br>Enterprise program his recent work with<br>Manuka honei company conv has led to new<br>methods to identify counterfeit man<br>Manuka honey and the identification of<br>lepadin which has led to a human<br>clinical trial to treat gastric<br>ulcers kri wins the prize for one of the<br>most Innovative abstracts it's up there<br>for an inaugural lecture where he liken<br>his work and in case you can't read it<br>at the back I'll just summarize it to<br>chucking ideas like paint splatters onto<br>an invisible canvas with the resulting<br>portrait resembling a battlefield mostly<br>lifted with SP Splats meeting tragic<br>ends amidst a few survivors battling<br>bravely as champions of opportunity for<br>their right to exist should make for an<br>yours<br>a now my hi toay hi toay hi toay welcome<br>everyone um and first of all thank you<br>very much for giving up your precious<br>time to come to this lecture I hope uh<br>there'll be something in it for uh for<br>everyone um thank my family um Karen<br>Carol Al Partners K is isolating from Co<br>so unfortunately he can't be here<br>tonight Reagan's working but Karen and<br>Dave Michelle gerl Carol have I missed I<br>missed<br>anyone welcome so this is where you get<br>to probably for the first time I get to<br>spill on a little bit what I do so um<br>and thank you to the university for the<br>refreshments and the food that we had<br>before I hope that put you in a bit of a<br>jolly mood for what's to come um and<br>finally the uh the building itself as<br>you'll see Old Government house and this<br>venue is highly appropriate for what I'm<br>about to talk about so I'm going to uh<br>you start off now you probably noticed I<br>have a bagpipe Vibe going on you know so<br>um before we ease into the more<br>scientific elements of my life and<br>career and stuff like that I thought I<br>would tell tell a little bit about my<br>history and background and bit of<br>outlook on life through my bagpipe and<br>so this is going to sound a little bit<br>weird but I'm going to give the floor to<br>my bagpipe and my bagpipe is going to<br>tell a story so just go with it weird I<br>know but then I'll switch back into me<br>as you you'll<br>see so I'm a mixture of old and<br>new my uh my soul lies in my drones<br>these things here I was conceived in<br>1890 by Jr Glenn somewhere in Scotland I<br>don't know how I managed to get to New<br>Zealand or who my first Guardians were<br>but I was passed on to Colin Craig who<br>was a fine Piper in pal North Carrie and<br>his brother used to go to Colin for Peck<br>lessons and so the tune that Carrie<br>played in the members Lounge was a<br>example of a peck called mcdougall's<br>Gathering um and the interpretation of<br>that you might have heard when I play<br>when kri played some cadences at the<br>went and the way to interpret That Tune<br>is to imagine you're plank to the Four<br>Points of a compass and that you're in a<br>castle and you got all everyone on the<br>land below you and you're calling them<br>up for a great event perhaps it's a<br>battle or something like that so my<br>interpret of that was a calling for you<br>to come to this lecture tonight the<br>second turn I played or Carri played as<br>he was standing outside was a CH called<br>Jimmy blue as a hornpipe composed by<br>Colin<br>Craig the story I'm going to tell you is<br>based in South taranaki important points<br>of interest are partier in particular<br>wavely white TOA we're going to come<br>back to the white to Tavern at the end<br>and of course wui that tune that Carri<br>played coming up was a 68 tune called<br>farewell to the Creeks that was a tune<br>that the partier pipe band had in their<br>street March repertoire when they played<br>down the main street of hara in 1950 at<br>a taranaki center contest in the front<br>rank is K's mom<br>Elizabeth flanked by her two brothers<br>Fred and Bill and so one of my great<br>gifts is a bagpipe is the ability to<br>emotionally connect people over ages and<br>so perhaps the feeling that you felt as<br>Carrie played that trun farewell to the<br>creeps was somewhat similar to the T the<br>feelings that those people next to the<br>cars as though have drinking the aroma<br>tea as the pipe band plus marched by<br>another thing I'm very good at is<br>playing at events and commemorating<br>events this is the parip band playing at<br>Car's mom and Father's wedding in wavely<br>that's wavely church that you can see<br>there on the left hand side<br>is the white Ure exchange it's now a<br>private residence but the ramparts of<br>the exchange still remain so K's mother<br>used to ride who Francis baret motorbike<br>10K from wavely to White to exchange and<br>it was there through the white to<br>exchange Network that she met Maurice so<br>Maurice immigrated is englished came out<br>after World War II uh after Ser serving<br>some time in the Merchant Navy in Sid<br>Castle cliff woi and they used to talk<br>across the exchanges in between plugging<br>telephones krie remembers as a young boy<br>watching the partia pipe band and then<br>later playing in it this is the main<br>street of wavely now that was September<br>picture taken two months ago in the<br>early days Carrie remembers that sener<br>half in the middle as we were preparing<br>to pay for Anzac Day in those days in<br>the' 70s that whole street was filled<br>with world World War I and World War II<br>veterans and Carrie after playing at<br>Anzac Day services for the on and off<br>for the next 30 Years personally witness<br>firsthand how those numbers grew fewer<br>and fewer each year the horse on the<br>left was just commemorated put up a<br>couple of years ago oh sorry two months<br>ago that's kiwi who won the 1983<br>Melbourne cup so wavely decided to put<br>statue the other great gift I have as a<br>bagpipe is the ability to connect<br>generations to land so krie made his way<br>to me through his grandfather William<br>pots William pots and his whole family<br>that played the bag pipes immigrated<br>from u cudb in airshire and William<br>settled in Ria at the end of around<br>October 1914 he spent four months and<br>then join the canbury mounted rifles and<br>in those days the New Zealand government<br>sent about 10,000 horses to fight in<br>galipoli Grandad took his own horse who<br>was renowned as a great jumper the story<br>is that on board of the ship the the<br>horses got very sick and William was<br>about the only one that could go down<br>and tend for the<br>horses um that's a picture of William<br>jumping his horse in<br>Egypt um that photo must have been taken<br>before they went to gipo because he had<br>to shoot his horse at galipoli during<br>the evacuation<br>and helped bury the dead before he was<br>evacuated to Egypt he came back to New<br>Zealand and settled in South karanak<br>where he met my grandmother K's<br>grandmother so krie as a young boy 10<br>years old remembered the passing of his<br>grandfather and this uh he remembers<br>being down at the bottom there of that<br>vantage point and remembers granddad's<br>his granddad's brother jock playing his<br>bag pipes from that very vantage point<br>that you see and then I had the<br>privilege of being played by krie 31<br>years later for the passing of Vera<br>granddad's uh wife from this very same<br>vantage point and finally two months ago<br>I had the privilege of being played from<br>that vantage point at the passing of<br>their son Fred who marched beside<br>Elizabeth down the main street of<br>hara I also have a deceptively Dark Side<br>to me as well and that is that I'm<br>absolutely torturous to anyone that has<br>to learn to play<br>me and not only did Carrie by the way<br>they were all taught by Elizabeth their<br>mom uh to begin with not only did Carrie<br>play but his older brother was learning<br>his younger s older sister was uh<br>learning the bag pipes and his youngest<br>brother was learning the snare drum so<br>literally coming back from school it was<br>a continuous monotonous sound of bag<br>pipes up and down the passageway for<br>hours and hours our next door neighbor<br>Mr higgy was deaf and we always wondered<br>whether he was deaf you know because he<br>was just deaf or we drove him DEA over<br>many many years of<br>playing so that's the to the<br>BP so from there I'm back into to me now<br>if you didn't guess so I went to Wong<br>High School ended up at Messa University<br>and this is a picture must have been<br>taken in the<br>around 87 or something like that I<br>always wonder I was doing my doctorate<br>at the time I always wonder why I<br>actually went and did a doctorate the<br>only thing I can think of is one of the<br>few times in life when your social<br>habits align perfectly with your<br>research project CU in those days my<br>research project was alcohol it was<br>looking at an enzyme called alahh<br>dehydrogenase and in those days it was<br>it was a combined Department it was<br>called chem biochem so there's no such<br>thing as biochemistry it was all<br>squished together the person in the<br>middle was Dick B he was the director of<br>the alcohol Research Unit and it was<br>brilliant so on a Friday night they<br>would if you think about how the alcohol<br>testing and the blood tests got<br>developed in the early<br>days on Fridays they used to call for<br>student volunteers to drink certain<br>amount of alcohol per unit time and they<br>would take blood alcohol measurements so<br>after reading in those days Kem ABS CU<br>we didn't have online stuff we had those<br>big books K ABS you had to go to the<br>journal we would go get free beer um and<br>then we'd go down to the DS which is as<br>it was known back then by a big Brie for<br>five bucks cuz they're doing<br>experimental stuff so it was like heaven<br>um my supervis that's next to me is<br>Peter Shephard who was doing his PhD at<br>the same time always wondered why he<br>seems taller Anna that's Paul me in the<br>front if you yeah so he I saw him for<br>the first time in about 30 years at<br>these citometry conference that Anna<br>hosted um my supervisors were Paul<br>Buckley and Trevor kitson on the right<br>Trevor was particularly an enigma he was<br>Master he went on Mastermind two times<br>did very well he was Krypton Factor<br>Champion twice in a row and he won sale<br>of the century and I remember him<br>winning a v3000 Mitsubishi Sigma which<br>he used to go and drive up to the<br>National plateau uh and he also was on<br>sale of the century New Zealand versus<br>Australia you never know when you're in<br>these sort of things you know where life<br>is going to go and who bounces back but<br>there's a cluster of people there and<br>there's Ted Heather and Margaret sitting<br>there and of course we're all together<br>at the time and um you'll see that<br>they've been a big part of the story<br>they're going to tell you it's also<br>where I met Karen so a couple of weeks<br>ago we were down at uh gr OG's 80th in<br>the man to Scottish pipe pole I played<br>with them in the man of Scottish pip<br>band which you can see on the right hand<br>side I met Karen I think around<br>1981 um I knew her father he was the<br>bass drummer in the B Band before I ever<br>met Karen but I met Karen and these<br>various KES that we used to have in the<br>M Scottish band hall and the bottom<br>picture as an example of one we used to<br>have a lot of Highland feasts if you're<br>a vegetarian it wasn't good because we<br>used to eat sheep hats roasted sheep's<br>hats from long be freezing<br>works from there I did a post over at<br>Carolin in Stockholm again working on<br>alcohol so it was just a big winwin all<br>around um I worked with Hans yval so at<br>the time he was chair of the Nobel<br>committee so awarding the physiology and<br>Nobel Prize each year it wasn't short of<br>people coming like big wigs coming and<br>giving talks because they think you know<br>I need to give talks to this um the top<br>photo you see I'm looking quite stunned<br>we're in a basement lab and that picture<br>was taken about 2:30 in the afternoon<br>and those trees are silhouetted gives<br>you in a winter time there at 3:00 it's<br>pitch black and so I used to get you<br>know finished work at 6 or something it<br>felt like the middle of the night anyway<br>um I remember going to see Thomas check<br>and Sydney Alman the Nobel lecture for<br>catalytic RNA I even joined a Stockholm<br>pipe band which is a brilliant social<br>ticket into the social network of Sweden<br>played at international soccer games<br>believe it or not<br>um the 1990 equestrian World Games I<br>even played with him at the world Champs<br>in in Glasgow playing for a Swedish pipe<br>band I even played with Kurt vitri KH we<br>all went to a conference in Kina for the<br>Midnight Sun and I was up the top of<br>Kiran Nana drinking I think it's called<br>varus It's a combination lingan berry<br>juice and vodka and I was with Kurt VRI<br>the guy that you know sold protein<br>structures by enmr UM playing the bag<br>pipes watching the Midnight<br>Sun from there came back as John<br>mentioned to New Zealand so we're just<br>trying to work out when this was taken<br>it had to be pre2 2006 from what we can<br>gather so in those days this is before<br>the formation of the schol biological<br>sciences in '94 U this was I think level<br>three on the biochemistry Department in<br>the chemistry building um uh that's at<br>the bottom is Roy gys me playing at a<br>a few faces there you'll<br>remember so my first project was um<br>collaboration with shamain a Conor and<br>David Christie and that's the bottom is<br>a as a picture of the lab and we're<br>working on a lias called B salt<br>stimulated liay what's interesting about<br>this is that it's present in h in human<br>breast milk and it's quite high in<br>abundance about<br>1% um it's also a digestive enzyme so<br>it's normally found in the jordina so<br>when you drink stuff and eat stuff and<br>you have that whole digestive thing<br>going on this lipase is normally down<br>there and it's activated specifically by<br>B salts but what Nature has done it's<br>put it in the breast milk and it's F<br>fought to protect against you know<br>premature digestive system of the infant<br>uh and so that was pretty interesting<br>so um Tony Robertson was uh<br>I told you I'd show you a younger<br>version of yourself Tony so Tony Tony<br>was really into muant and so it turned<br>out that this liay had a series of C<br>terminal repeats which are heavily<br>glycosilated and a noted similarity in<br>that type of relationship to muin so we<br>were able to show by substituting these<br>that those essentially putting a piece<br>of snot on the end of this protein<br>enabled it to survive the stomach and in<br>the jum which is pretty cool you think<br>about how you might deliver peptide or<br>protein cargo and protect it add a bit<br>of snot to it is might be one way that<br>you can<br>go um Nigel<br>arrived must have been two or three<br>months after me I think from the NIH and<br>set up cell expression so this is a<br>shout out to Ben who's our current PhD<br>students so B next to where are you next<br>time you complain about how you only<br>getting 10 or 20 migs of your<br>protein we I won't tell you how long<br>this took me but we had to we expressed<br>the truncated version of this without<br>the sea terminal repeats I could only<br>get it to about half a MIG per Mill and<br>I sent 200 microl regularly to Richard<br>Kingston who was based down at Massie at<br>the time and Heather and Ted were sto<br>down there as well but eventually we<br>managed to get a crystal structure and<br>it turned out yes that piece of snot of<br>muin which stabilized the pro and very<br>important also protect it from<br>aggregating and what it revealed normal<br>lipases like pancreatic lipase they have<br>little Lids as you can see in that inset<br>that flip open and shut that protect the<br>protein from aggregating the BIOS salt<br>stimulated lipas is an open sort of<br>structure and so that's why those C<br>terminal repeats are really<br>important it had sort of um you know<br>some commercial application so in our<br>excitement we filed a patent of<br>expressing this thing and making it cuz<br>the thing about this lias it's not found<br>in cow's milk or goat's milk or sheep's<br>milk uh or her heror milk so um we got<br>gazumped big time so astrazenica had f a<br>patent so this is in the days in the<br>early days of transgenic technology<br>which promised so much and what they did<br>is that they licensed that patent to PPL<br>Therapeutics that Dolly the sheep the<br>Clone sheep so so the idea was um they<br>had their lead drug was alpha 1 antirion<br>but the second was the SASE and their<br>indication was to treat pancreatic<br>insufficiency so people with cystic<br>vibrosis and things like that um<br>so so we got gazed and sort of the story<br>ended there a little bit I do remember<br>deck going into his office um one time<br>in um in must be 96 level two where the<br>Imaging equipment is at the moment and<br>he came in and he said carry I I try to<br>do my best Tock impersonation so he said<br>carry and he goes like you've got to<br>realize in the one hand you're working<br>on milk on lipes and on the other hand<br>what's our biggest export one of our<br>biggest export Industries it's milk it's<br>fontera and so we tried to sort of put<br>all that together but it never really<br>the idea of producing genetically<br>modified or Rec combinant Li and selling<br>and it was just it wasn't going to<br>happen but there is an interesting sort<br>of to that so in between about that time<br>I played occasionally on the top of<br>ockland War Museum for ANC day Services<br>we even had a celc band playing at<br>galra for years um had a few fights in<br>the band actually I remember a couple of<br>times but um we also played with um Paul<br>McCartney in '93 so he did a world tour<br>played at Weston Springs we play Malik<br>and Tyre um and we got to spend a whole<br>day with Linda and Paul in the band it's<br>really cool uh but of course the<br>Highlight was playing at Tracy and John<br>Taylor's wedding in Mount<br>Eden um we also you know played a bit of<br>music at the uh end of year school of<br>biological sciences party and to give a<br>big plug for what's happening in a few<br>weeks it's a<br>WrestleMania so I did get some comments<br>about the health and safety implications<br>of this to which the only response is<br>wrong but that's a nice segue into the<br>next phase which was with G Cooper<br>affectionately so G this has meant in<br>the nicest possible way gForce because<br>you are a force of nature um and uh<br>academic<br>bulldozer um and I meant that nicely as<br>well um but this was I think back as a<br>golden time of you know creativity<br>purpose and a center of gravity<br>um the days of course as and John<br>alluded we you know the um the<br>beginnings of a uh of<br>a inhouse by tech company<br>um the liace story is interesting<br>because when I first met G if you<br>remember we went down to Wellington for<br>a dairy<br>conference and that who was at the dairy<br>conference but Ian wilmart who cloned<br>doly the sheep and some guy Coleman this<br>was before they cloned Olie the Sheep<br>they just published some nature papers<br>on nuclear transfer and they're<br>presenting at the Willington conference<br>but the real reason they were in New<br>Zealand they were trying to get a<br>manufacturing capacity at ruakura to<br>manufact a manufacturing plant for the<br>transgenic flot the idea of what they're<br>doing the cloning thing was if they<br>could produce a high value animal they<br>just clone it um and of course England<br>had you know Britain had you know foot a<br>mouth scare so yuzon was the perfect<br>place it fell over they fell over for<br>whatever reason there's various but I<br>always look back and say if that had<br>worked think of we could have had a real<br>pharmaceutical industry in New Zealand<br>transgenic<br>technology so very briefly because I'm<br>just sprinkling I'm going to just<br>sprinkle across areas here so we're<br>involved in two main areas so really in<br>you know gas the the whole amaline and<br>caleton Gene related peptides one is<br>eyet amid one is cgrp the eyet amid<br>story be cell survival so if you're<br>insulin resistant there a your beta<br>cells can compensate for a while they<br>produce more insulin but then they crash<br>and burn and one of the contributing<br>factors to that is the production of OT<br>amalo so there was a really exciting<br>time there where we had really good um<br>trans model worked closely with Jackie<br>um and looking at small molecule waves<br>of being able to disrupt that process a<br>parallel line as well not just an<br>overexpression phenomenon but the whole<br>ability of the S Machinery to preserve<br>folding so if you think of some of the<br>commonalities between Alzheimer's and<br>say diabetes we think of overexpression<br>but also there could be factors around<br>the ability of the cellular Machinery<br>itself to to be able to fold those<br>proteins which may provide some um<br>common explanations the other one is<br>cgrp a neuropeptide again this could be<br>a whole lecture so I'm just going to<br>bounce here two main things um one arm<br>of researches around energy expenditure<br>so we found that knockout animals had<br>increased energy<br>expenditure um and that's sort of you<br>know Taps into the whole energy weight<br>thing around uh you you keep you know<br>about 2third of your energy budgets<br>towards keeping your body temperature at<br>37° so you only have to tap into that a<br>little bit more to modulate one way and<br>there's a whole area of research now on<br>Brown fat and that's also developed into<br>collaborations with my Chinese<br>colleagues the other one which became<br>apparent was the um cgp antagonist so<br>agents that block cgp are now approv<br>migrain drugs and so um that also led<br>into a really nice collaboration with<br>Margaret's group um biologist and you<br>know working together and doing some<br>really nice work about you know<br>attaching and being able to develop some<br>peptide antagonist which also retained<br>functionality there was even a bit of a<br>side not side project but gave a talk in<br>China one time and eligan came up so<br>these are the botox company very rich<br>from<br>Botox um but the one of their main<br>products is batos it's a uh treatment of<br>glycom or eye pressure ocular but they<br>were looking for indication extension it<br>increases eyelash by by the way um but<br>they found also that uh when they<br>administered to rats they lost weight so<br>we did a series of metabolic St um<br>studies with Christopher and James um<br>showing that there was a satiety induced<br>effect it's the only time in my research<br>career I've received $100,000 US in the<br>mail literally in the mail I had to open<br>it and think do I really have to take<br>services so I do want to revisit the<br>health and safety things so when I got<br>that comment yesterday about the health<br>and safety implications of this SPS<br>Christmas party I<br>thought perhaps I need just to show you<br>how safety conscious I really am so um<br>and the high standards that I adhere to<br>so if you came into my lab years ago you<br>would find that we're absolutely<br>fastidious clearly clean in everything<br>we did there were no hazards anywhere<br>nothing hanging off tables no one drank<br>or you know ate in the lab at all you<br>would never find yellow bins full dirty<br>balancers or anything like that and for<br>those adherence to the such high<br>standards me together with Christina<br>Buchanan were were gifted the uh the<br>design of the SPs of the safety poster<br>which I am happy to say is still here 20<br>years later in the masspec lab so that's<br>my<br>defense so moving on so the prix's drug<br>at the and G correct me if I'm if I'm<br>wrong but the diabetes is associated<br>with the accumulation of copper so the<br>lead drug was essentially a ke copper<br>keator excess of copper diabetic<br>complications not that great so we had<br>some ideas around extending that to find<br>out what other proteins might be<br>involved in that space and one of those<br>led to Leo pay's PhD project with de<br>glycating enzymes and so you might be<br>familiar with the term hba1c so this is<br>a measure of diabetic or glycemic<br>control glucose comes along WR and um<br>attaches to primary aiming groups it's a<br>called a Malad reaction um and if You'<br>got diabetes high blood sugar levels you<br>get higher levels believe it or not the<br>body's got a defense system against that<br>and these these enzymes fructose 3<br>kinase phosphates that industrial<br>product and can reverse it if it's let<br>goes<br>unchecked you get things like Advanced<br>glycation end products which are not<br>that great so what Leo is working on was<br>a related peptide<br>protein called fn3 kyos related protein<br>and he was the first to map out the<br>activite topology plus led to some<br>hypotheses as to where that might be<br>acting CU that's still actually not<br>known and what makes it really<br>interesting is that's just been recently<br>discovered as a longevity Gene so when<br>they compare centurions and younger<br>people they have increased levels of<br>this and so there's ideas around that<br>the ability to reduce and counteract<br>these is good for<br>longevity if you look at the preclinical<br>research they're also looking at<br>incorporating eye drops for cataract<br>treatments to try and reverse ages in<br>Cataract<br>means the other project was Project<br>called myoco oxygenase and you can see<br>GTH and and Ted so the reason we got on<br>to this was that we're looking we found<br>this identified this protein as a had a<br>Loosely catable ion so in order to to<br>get full activity you had to actually<br>incubate it with fe2 which is sort of<br>interesting cuz they think of things<br>like the fenon reaction which is not<br>that great either so uh Peter Brown um<br>spent his PhD looking at the structure<br>structural biology of that and found um<br>and solved the structure and actually<br>was a really exciting structure because<br>so two ions you can see here one bound<br>the myosl substrate but the the<br>structure was so good that was unable<br>able to unequivalently assign what the<br>Catal mechanism had to be so one of the<br>iron one of the division of labor was<br>binding oxygen the other one was buying<br>myos um<br>substrate that led us to investigate its<br>role in kidney disease because this myox<br>is exclusively um expressed in the renal<br>cortex and diabetes and hypertension are<br>key drivers of an kidney State um<br>disease and where the link is here is<br>that there's a phenomenon in diabetes<br>never really been explained where<br>there's a depletion of myosl in the<br>renal cortex no one really knew how uh<br>why that happens and it turns out that<br>the catabolism of myosl through this<br>pathway occurs through myo which is a<br>gatekeeper enzyme and what George and<br>the PhD project was able to show was<br>that the phenomenon of myos depletion<br>was not just specific to diabetes<br>occurred in hypertension insulin<br>resistance and it turns out in other<br>studies that um if you overexpress myox<br>and animal studies you get proximal<br>tubal damage due to oxidative stress<br>it's an open questions to where the my<br>the myo itself does it but it also<br>depletes nadph and if you deplete this<br>baby here and you you um increase the SE<br>stress uh we also thought this the end<br>product that patho is pretty cool so zos<br>5 phosphate is a lipogenic signaling<br>molecule and Richard and we didn't know<br>at the time the structural function of<br>the protein that did that and that<br>formed the basis of one pro one of<br>Richard's projects where he solved the<br>structure now the story coming up<br>so this story so the myar story of the<br>the structure that uh Peter had solv<br>there was some evidence in the<br>literature that it Formed it had protein<br>binding Partners um and so we did a bit<br>of a fishing Expedition and just really<br>sequenced what came down with it turns<br>out it doesn't really have any protein<br>binding Partners so don't believe<br>everything you read in the literature<br>obviously but this 33k band we pulled<br>down and we sequenced it looked really<br>interesting and interesting enough they<br>actually Richard crystallize it and<br>solve the<br>structure um and the reason it was<br>interesting it was linked to a rare<br>disease called primary hyper oxaluria so<br>if you think having one kidney stone is<br>bad imagine someone that has 100 kidney<br>stones so it's obviously not great so<br>this is a a rare metabolic disease where<br>there's an increasing oxalate production<br>in the liver in severe cases the<br>recipient needs um liver<br>transplant so there are three types the<br>one that of the protein that we had<br>solved was responsible for one called a<br>type<br>three the most milder type of so it's<br>quite variable in its onset and so forth<br>pursue is that what it does is that you<br>degrade collagen on a daily basis and<br>that feeds into this<br>hydroxyproline and it feeds and this<br>hoga one which is what the enzymes<br>called produces glyoxalate and then<br>that's converted by an enzyme lactate<br>dehydrogen to oxalate but the weird<br>thing is it's whatever the mutation was<br>doing was increasing the production of<br>oxalate so that prevailing some of the<br>thoughts at the time had to be a gain of<br>function so we were poised because we<br>had pretty much all the tools there to<br>go and investigate this and so we<br>constructed the uh most prevalent<br>mutants and Julia McDonald's<br>PhD was able to conclusively show the<br>loss of function so we're able to show<br>that the protein is expressed but<br>rapidly degraded through the ubiquit and<br>proteosomal pro pathway because if you<br>block that then we can actually see the<br>protein so it's absolutely a loss of<br>function which again just compounds to<br>whatever that mystery is how is a loss<br>of function of the enzyme contributing<br>to an increase in<br>oxalate so the other thing that we did<br>is that and people had somehow missed it<br>is that the the<br>um this enzyme has another activity<br>which feeds off a metabolic pathway<br>called the CB<br>cycle and the best way I could probably<br>I was just thinking how to explain this<br>how a loss of function could increase<br>oxalate so I'm going to<br>climate change so the Northwestern<br>Motorway right so about this time of the<br>year we get King Tides you get Tides<br>come up and sometimes it washes over the<br>Northwest and it floods it at certain<br>times but the Earth is Clos to the Sun<br>so the analogy here is that loss of<br>function raises if you like the<br>threshold or the level of the sea a<br>little bit so it's more likely when you<br>get Tides coming in and out it washes<br>over and in this case the washing tide<br>is an increase in Ned cuz what the CB<br>cycle does is it it's critical for<br>maintaining a thing called Redux balance<br>in the cell the NAD to nadh ratio and<br>that can be also influenced by insulin<br>resistance and metabolic disease so that<br>reaction where the glyoxalate is<br>converted to oxalate is actually a<br>second order reaction so even though so<br>the idea is that you're increasing the<br>rate of the reaction by increasing the<br>rate of conversion of the glyoxalate<br>that's already there I've got to<br>actually present that this year at the<br>um auxillary Workshop so even though<br>it's a really rare disease one in<br>300,000<br>people everyone in the world is in that<br>room that treats it all over the world<br>and they've never really looked at the<br>metabolic status of any of their<br>patients that present with this so<br>that's what they came away with they<br>were quite excited and that's what<br>they're going to do when they present<br>the patients they're going to<br>characterize what the metabolic<br>phenotype to see if they can get an idea<br>about a link between the metabolic<br>phenotype and the production of<br>oxalate<br>oh here we come Story Another<br>Story knowledge wave so you may remember<br>sorry G I was going to ask if this is<br>okay but I I had to put it on I just had<br>to<br>so 2000 Helen Clark government John Hood<br>VC hosted a knowledge wave conference<br>forget where it was I think might even<br>been a center biotechnology was going to<br>2024 next year I think that sort of they<br>forgot about that because there's no<br>metrics that have been kept sort of like<br>they got anyway that's another story so<br>it was a knowledge wave conference and<br>so B Tech and so that was a a really<br>good there were you know pric was around<br>the idea of um you know and the<br>bioscience Enterprise was conceived<br>around that time and its early<br>Beginnings um and of course LED as John<br>alluded to earlier the formation of<br>Innovation Institute for Innovation and<br>biotechnology um and you have to give c<br>yorg a lot of credit here I think it was<br>way ahead of the curve in terms of<br>vision and you know um and getting this<br>but what really happened here was a<br>really nice way to interact with<br>industry<br>um and one of the um<br>uh Cornerstone tenants and again John<br>referred was conv and so conv<br>um one of the really attractive things<br>was the government was really on board<br>so Callahan Innovation they had some<br>really nice R&amp;D grants you could apply<br>for PhD scholarships there was a<br>criteria for having some industry<br>funding not just PhD scholarships Master<br>scholarships summer student scholarships<br>honors scholarships mention for we our<br>summer students doing prog projects<br>funded and they on a monthly basis you<br>didn't have to wait a whole year before<br>you found out about something so a<br>really nice way to bring students on<br>convo really invested in<br>R&amp;D and you know it's that Melting Pot<br>thing they occupy a building you don't<br>really know what they do you get to know<br>them and you know in terms out mon honey<br>is a really interesting story um<br>obviously it's come from the Manuka<br>plant it's FDA approved W dressing for<br>um ulcers celebrity endorsements I think<br>Novak jovic the tennis player swears by<br>having a teaspoon of Manuka Honey every<br>morning we recently lost the trademark<br>so we can't so Australia can call their<br>honey Manuka honey so lots of stuff<br>going<br>on but that led to a really nice<br>collaboration with Margaret and her team<br>PhD students on through Kahan and<br>inovation um and we really got to uh you<br>know answer some and we're quite<br>productive in that time published a<br>whole lot of<br>stuff so I'm just going to give you the<br>one minute overview<br>so um turns out turns out if you take<br>Manuka honey you dilute it and you put<br>it in a spectral photometer that can<br>measure<br>fluoresence turns out you can identify<br>two unique fluorescent<br>signatures that are not sh by any other<br>honey Kuka honey has its own set of<br>distinctive fluorescent<br>signatures but on that basis you can<br>identify Manuka Honey which led actually<br>to like a handheld little portable thing<br>just put it up it's got the TOs Manuka<br>Honey at the same time a Japanese Group<br>K Group discovered LEP topin and then we<br>were able to show after that that it<br>corresponds to one of those fluorescent<br>signatures and Margaret I think<br>synthesized that and now supplies it to<br>all the all the labs<br>the other one was a really nice story so<br>Gana came into my office one day and<br>said here's a little fraction it's got a<br>bit of color in it and I said really you<br>know after 40 years people fractionate<br>these things and they see something<br>turned out it was this and so Ben<br>Daniels has formed the basis of his PhD<br>project part of it it was a little bit<br>you know there were a few possibilities<br>But ultimately unequivocally were able<br>to show this was the case and the first<br>time this was reported in any product as<br>I understand then we're able to show<br>that that was responsible for the mm2<br>signature<br>middle so then what we did is then we<br>surveyed a whole lot about 183 Honeys<br>certified that we knew what they were in<br>did cluster analysis so looked at all<br>the metabolites the pc1 you know<br>principal component anal um cluster<br>analysis and showed that lodine and<br>lepin were really really good predictors<br>of authentic City authenticity of Manuka<br>honey we all know that at at the same<br>time that Ministry of primary industries<br>were developing those I'm going to put<br>myself out on alarm and say ours are<br>better because the MPI two of their<br>markers is also common to<br>Kuka which means that you can take a<br>kanuka honey mix it with a bit of Manuka<br>honey and call it Manuka honey but we<br>were absolutely sure of our standard cuz<br>we even one went one step further we<br>went to the nectar we went to the nectar<br>and able B to show that these compounds<br>were specific finally we even went cuz<br>we could we did a proteomic analysis of<br>honey it's first time it's ever been<br>done and we're able to identify three<br>novel proteins or tryptic markers um and<br>show that they were specific to the<br>nectar of the Manuka and um pretty much<br>do a heat map so we can also use that<br>for Au Sy as well the interesting thing<br>here is that you know when you put a be<br>where you put a hive somewhere the bees<br>just go to whatever plants there are<br>right so you have a whole lot of<br>different floral character because we<br>identified or traced it back to the<br>nectar you can see for instance in this<br>Kuka we know that that Trace is because<br>there's a bit of Manuka floating around<br>in the beeh in the<br>area so<br>finally this appeared online last week I<br>think just got<br>accepted so the thing with Manuka honey<br>it's a it's a wound healing dressing so<br>it's got like it's got other properties<br>it's high osmolarity it's got low PH<br>which is good for wound<br>healing but there's obviously other<br>stuff in it there's preclinical evidence<br>some preclinical evidence that<br>beneficial in inflammatory Bell disease<br>and murine<br>models so we were able to identify that<br>it<br>inhibited um a interesting candidate<br>called mmp9 it remodels the wound<br>Matrix um and it doesn't completely<br>inhibit it but enough that it gives some<br>Credence to you know perhaps if you take<br>some Manuka you might be able to hit<br>this Target in um in Vivo and the Reddit<br>Institute had also done some studies<br>contributing to this paper showing that<br>the Le kodin was stable was able to<br>survive stomach conditions and the<br>pancreatic digestions as well and so as<br>John said that's and currently in a<br>human clinical trial atago for gastri<br>ulcers and I got an email like literally<br>2 hours ago from con saying it's on 7<br>sharp tonight as well at 7:00 they got<br>interviewed so they're going to mention<br>it you watch it on<br>demand uh during that time I uh probably<br>got sick of playing in pipe bands cuz<br>you spend all your money or sorry all<br>your time and summer likeing you have a<br>family you know you spend all your<br>January February and the national<br>contest is in March you know it's get a<br>bit boring so my daughter ay<br>dances<br>and uh we'll talk up dancing that's here<br>in the uh bottom I think was the Oakland<br>Highland Games with some<br>dogs um played at the W poo Highland<br>Games very often on New Year's Day which<br>was always a bummer because you couldn't<br>really you know enjoy yourself that much<br>on New Year's Eve and I can assure you<br>playing the bagpipe on a hangover is not<br>fun it really isn't uh turina Highland<br>Games I played there probably spent a<br>bit too much time propping up the bar<br>because they had a bar right next to the<br>piping stage so you can listen to the<br>peck that I played at the beginning and<br>light<br>music so running out of stories to tell<br>you two<br>more Morris wilin Center so the Morris<br>wilin Center is a uh one of the center<br>of research<br>Excellence uh been going for quite a<br>while now into cancer infectious disease<br>metabolic disease but I think one one of<br>its real strengths is its ability to<br>bring together a whole network of<br>researchers across diverse Fields um<br>this ultimately led to some really nice<br>collaborations with uh colleagues in<br>guango and<br>gibh um leading also to a framework a<br>patent framework so that um that pesky<br>little thing called IP is sort of solv<br>the two institutions develop some IP<br>it's shared nice framework of 50 so some<br>really nice framework stuff puts people<br>in contact with other<br>people um that was supposed to be<br>staggered anyway the whole thing's up<br>there so this led to um one project this<br>is dong High wo and Hannah um at gbh so<br>we obviously know food supplements and<br>medicines so the supplement thing is<br>interesting so there's actually aist L<br>an article that<br>was online at the moment about you know<br>issues with supplements and whether they<br>work or not this is actually a<br>discussion that someone took this is the<br>actual discussion it's rare that you<br>actually have a photo and you can show<br>somebody that you're actually having<br>this very discussion this is Jill Evans<br>Evans so she's from Merk and we this is<br>a 2010 mwc Cruise in the in the harbor<br>and jelly was telling me used to work<br>with mer and um Ed skolik didn't she<br>yeah Ed Ed<br>skolik and<br>um she was saying well you know<br>supplements lots of issues you know they<br>have bio actors but often the bio actors<br>are so you<br>know they're not elevated enough and<br>high enough concentration this is why<br>you know drugs they have to prove they<br>work you also have issues obviously with<br>halflife and stuff like that and so<br>really this what this is is a bit of a<br>tweak on um<br>so this project so one way that you you<br>might be able to tweak the food<br>supplement thing is that you know we<br>know all know that whole foods are<br>really good for us and stuff like that<br>so the Chinese and Dong High have got<br>some really really nice animal models<br>glow-in-the-dark animal models so they<br>can take a this is an example so a ucp1<br>Lucifer mice so they've taken the ufer a<br>Luc ucp1 promoter and put it on a<br>reporter Gene so this is for brown fat<br>look at Browning and what they do is<br>they can screen for instance a um like a<br>a drug Library natural product one and<br>they can do two things they can do an<br>invitro screen so they can literally<br>take the stem cells from that modified<br>Mouse differentiate them into adipocytes<br>and Screen them do a high screen then<br>they can you know get a hit then what<br>they can do is they can administer that<br>to the mouse and it glows in the dark so<br>they get a really nice method of<br>targetting engagement then demonstrate<br>efficiency there's the pesy little<br>problem of extraction to see if you can<br>get those bioactives out and this is<br>really interesting because now in the<br>one of the main issues with these<br>natural products R veratrol is a good<br>example everyone got really excited with<br>the resol when it first came out turns<br>out of course it's not high presentent<br>in high concentrations in red wine if it<br>does anything at all it's in high<br>concentrations in mice and it's<br>extensively modified over the gut and<br>Anthony we did a peruse gut experiment a<br>few years ago one of the stories I'm not<br>telling you um we did that we measured<br>it coming across the gut and you don't<br>see intact Reser you just see<br>metabolites so what the body circulation<br>sees is is often not what you think is<br>going<br>in anyway as long as you can demonstrate<br>efficacy what you could do is there's<br>been big advances in formulation so you<br>might be able to to mitigate poor<br>halflife by simply if you have the dose<br>high enough and you have a slowly<br>release extract then it just leaks like<br>a like a constant micro micro doing into<br>your system but at a level where you can<br>demonstrate efficacy that's the goal<br>anyway the goal towards more intelligent<br>you know knowing what your bioactives<br>are the lipin store and the cona is a<br>weit like that because they're<br>considering instead of benchmarking it<br>against MGO if this works they'll<br>Benchmark it against lodine levels<br>instead so they Benchmark it against non<br>bioactives the current project we have<br>is one that hits pgc1 alpha pgc1 alpha<br>is a really attractive Target for muscle<br>biogenesis if you can hit this it's good<br>for a lot of stuff think psychopedia<br>muscle wasting as you get older think of<br>an exercise type of pill it's probably<br>about<br>grandios um mitochondrial dysfunction<br>underlies a lot of neurog degenerative<br>disease as well but if you can get a<br>supplement that actually hits that and<br>they've identified some natural products<br>from I can't tell you but that does that<br>we're actually now undertaking about to<br>undertake a metabolic cage study with<br>Chris hedes Caitlyn and Tony um to look<br>at um the respiration the metabolic<br>indices of that and the ultimate<br>longterm goal is to see if we can<br>extract get from natural sources and<br>develop it into a<br>one so the H primary hyperoxia thing<br>that I told you about so it turns out<br>that we did in fact look to see if it<br>participated in respiration in the CB<br>cycle and so what we found is that in<br>the experimental system so we showed it<br>did just as it here but we had to<br>optimize the experimental system and and<br>our problem was we're looking at these<br>we're using a rapidly dividing heck 293<br>um cell system it already had really<br>high rates of respiration that we<br>actually couldn't there's no window to<br>see what we were looking for the only<br>way that we could make it work was that<br>we got a a inhibitor of an enzyme called<br>Malik enzyme 2 from a Chinese group when<br>we put that onto the cells pretty much<br>ablated the respiration rate of that<br>completely then we're able to see the<br>effect that we were looking for and we<br>thought that's pretty interesting this<br>enzyme is like short bypassing the creb<br>cycle essentially providing it with its<br>own Supply pyate it's like a internal<br>engine that's enabling these cells in<br>the absence of any like cytoplasmic<br>glycolysis or anything like that<br>maintain High respiration rates turns<br>out that's a really interesting story so<br>this melic enzyme 2<br>too there's yeah I asked Chris for a<br>nice<br>photo he sent me a whole lot and<br>honestly that's the nicest one I could<br>find um and this is laser tag so Andrew<br>yeah there's you uh and Ben and everyone<br>all the gang turns out it's a really<br>interesting story so cancer cells rewire<br>the metabolism I tend to look through my<br>lens of metabolic disease as cancer is a<br>metabolic phenomenon not a signal<br>instuction cuz ultimately everything<br>impinges on its ability to rewire its<br>metabolism a cancer cell particularly<br>rapidly divided one has to rely on<br>glutamine and glucose with those two<br>substrates as fuel it actually has to<br>make all the stuff it needs it has to<br>make the lipids the proteins and it also<br>has to have all the energy that it needs<br>to put all together turns out that Miken<br>2 is that Crux if you knock that out you<br>induce inessence you do it in melanoma<br>acute myoid leukemia triple negative<br>breast cancer pancreatic<br>cancer what makes it even more<br>interesting is that if you look at the<br>landscape of drugs which are in clinical<br>development these idh ones are<br>interesting so what cancer cells do some<br>they mutate isocitrate dehydrogenates<br>which is an enzyme the crib cycle to<br>produce another metabolite called T2<br>hydroxy glutarate that stabilizes m<br>p53 p-53 is almost a holy gril of cancer<br>research if you can Target that but it's<br>really been<br>intractable these drugs I think one of<br>them two of them are proved now is it<br>Targets this hydroxy glate and that if<br>you can stop that from stabilizing the<br>p53 it becomes degraded and you indu an<br>Essence turns out this micin on 2 does<br>exactly the same thing the really cool<br>thing is that no one's really looked at<br>this and the only inhibitor is that<br>we've just solved the crystal structure<br>of it in complex with Ben's project<br>funded through an drdf so I just give a<br>big plug for the drdf that funded this<br>so so this is Ben's poster so what we're<br>looking at currently is scope to see if<br>we can develop some high Affinity um<br>potent molecules so we're in discussions<br>now to try and um get some funding um<br>for<br>that it's pretty almost there how am I<br>doing for<br>time okay so at this time you know I you<br>always get to the end of the talk and<br>say oh God what should I what Pearls of<br>Wisdom can I possibly you know pass on<br>I've got two and I might direct that to<br>my family and um Karen you uh Kellen<br>who's recovering from Co rean can't be<br>here tonight and ay who's will make it<br>almost there um so I told you some<br>stories there's a lot of stories I<br>didn't tell you the reason I didn't tell<br>you those stories they never got funded<br>even though I thought I put my best foot<br>forward did everything right did<br>everything the referees wanted to and<br>still it didn't get funded so my P first<br>piece of advice<br>is that you can look it<br>up what how you think that might mean<br>and I was looking for like a a<br>mindfulness quote about how to cope with<br>it um the best I could do actually I did<br>find the answer in season 2 episode 21<br>of the Next Generation<br>in that episode Commander Data who<br>doesn't make mistakes he's an Android he<br>doesn't make mistakes he lost in a game<br>to some battle<br>strategist and even though he doesn't<br>make mistakes he began to doubt himself<br>so in this scene he's skullking thinking<br>there's something flawed and of course<br>what happens is John Luke peard comes<br>along and says the ultimate thing which<br>works<br>please Commander I require your presence<br>on the bridge Captain with all due<br>respect perhaps it would be better if<br>you choose another to serve as your<br>first officer data you are my first<br>officer I have not been able to isolate<br>the problem sir I might make a<br>mistake yes you might but that does not<br>alter your duty to me and to the<br>ship now do you know how to formulate a<br>premise yes sir then formulate this one<br>how do I deal with commander rker on the<br>halfway I will await your answer on the<br>bridge here it comes<br>Commander it is possible to commit no<br>mistakes and still<br>lose that is not a<br>weakness that is<br>life<br>I believe I understand<br>sir and data will you leave your<br>quarters happens you have to deal<br>with<br>it second<br>one create<br>opportunities um you would have<br>noticed that throughout the presentation<br>I showed lots of photos it's no accident<br>you don't get very far I think<br>particularly now if you don't interact<br>with people and form networks not only<br>does it make life interesting but your<br>technology skill sets can really take a<br>back with seat if you don't interact I<br>remember in<br>Sweden in hans's lab they spent entire<br>PhD and postto purifying a protein or a<br>peptide Venom tryptic sequencing it you<br>know digesting it putting on a liquid<br>phase sequencer that did a cycle every<br>like hour and then they manually put it<br>together it was a whole art there was a<br>whole two or threee project you do that<br>in one run and you don't even have to<br>have a purified protein to do it so you<br>can get stuck and I think you know<br>increasingly today with outputs and the<br>way that research is going in an<br>interdisciplinary way you have to<br>interact with people outside your skill<br>set and it's a<br>strength the other one is an interactive<br>one so it's giving to the end of the<br>talk forgive me forgive me family I'm<br>going here could you please<br>stand<br>you don't have to if you really don't<br>to come on Richard you can stand no go<br>on stand this is to get some blood into<br>everything<br>chance<br>I did think about this actually<br>on that's the story come on maybe so<br>what<br>shake shake<br>shake shake shake shake shake your F<br>shake<br>your oh shake shake<br>your nothing like a bit of a<br>boogie get sit<br>down point of that was at the point of<br>like yeah completely stripping away any<br>credibility I've had particular in the<br>health and safety area is uh I was in<br>gas office many years ago he probably<br>doesn't recall the discussion at all but<br>we're talking about ideas and one of the<br>ideas was well not ideas it's around how<br>you might approach going forward create<br>opportunities and one is to shake the<br>tree just shake stuff see what comes<br>down if you're in the drug Discovery<br>game that things I've been telling you<br>usually I know it's field you know<br>specific and contextual and stuff like<br>that but often if something's a Target<br>someone's worth doing someone in the<br>world will be doing it and probably much<br>better than you with resources the only<br>way you can mitigate that is Shake stuff<br>see what comes down use observation and<br>hopefully you might be able to land<br>yourself in a place which is a bit of a<br>territory it's like buying shares when<br>they're all going up you know if you buy<br>shares it's might as will give it away<br>you want to be at the ground floor and<br>hopefully the Malak enone 2 may be an<br>example of that cuz that's at a still<br>sort of you know at an early level no<br>compounds but interest has been taken in<br>our work um that's it I'm

to ra Hotel so next time<br>you travel down south Tac and you might<br>pass white<br>totra check out the<br>pub so New Year's Eve the partti PIP<br>band with my mother in it and her<br>brothers would have gone all the way<br>down from Hara stopping at all the<br>Country Hotel you know the the dances<br>and things and that would even ended up<br>you would have probably been drinking DB<br>bitter I assume it was back then I don't<br>wouldn't have much of a wine industry<br>almost certainly there' be a few fights<br>had broken out by then but then about<br>11:30 the band would come in uh and they<br>would play couple of tunes so I thought<br>that might be a nice way to close off my<br>you I'm going to turn off the sound cuz<br>great<br>microphones hopefully that doesn't come<br>through<br>h<br>I<br>t<br>is<br>I<br>the<br>the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
