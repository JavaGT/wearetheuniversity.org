font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>when I first started here quite a lot of<br>student they come up and we working with<br>them on their holiday we teach them how<br>to cut the Loon because when we had a<br>big glass house and we create our own<br>plants a lot of cutting and all the<br>thing like<br>that when I grew up as a boy everyone<br>did a bit of gardening but today that's<br>not the case people are living in<br>apartments highrises they don't get to<br>do that as much one of the best things<br>about being a gardener is it's actually<br>There's Hope cuz when you plant<br>something there's the hope that it will<br>grow into something so it you know you<br>it creates hope in<br>people we start at day break in the<br>mornings at<br>6:30 when the sun comes up when it's<br>quiet and we start working before the<br>people arrive that it's ready when the<br>people come in and we always try to make<br>beautiful little spaces with plants and<br>flowers where you can just sit quiet for<br>a<br>moment we would like to get the bees<br>back the Bumble beaks the butterflies<br>the insects we like to get the birds<br>back we're really fortunate here at the<br>University of ockland because while<br>we're a city center campus and we have<br>campuses that are really quite urbanized<br>we have amazing<br>spaces as I walk through the Gardens<br>Just Around the Clock Tower there's so<br>many different things to see so many<br>beautiful colors at any time of<br>year the plants we've got are quite<br>unique in many cases they they're not uh<br>all over the country they're they're<br>quite special so the research that they<br>do and and the teaching that can be done<br>here is just as important as as the<br>buildings<br>really the University Gardens are a real<br>integral part of the experience for<br>students and staff here at the<br>University of<br>Oakland the students actually often vote<br>with their feet so you know they want to<br>be outside meeting uh they they love<br>sitting in the gardens and and meeting<br>their<br>friends if you take away the gardens and<br>it's just concrete and hot spaces and<br>very<br>hot<br>Garden started originally because of our<br>government house and our government<br>Parliament most of the three years I<br>think they close to 200 years<br>old some of them they still grind and<br>some of them a shame<br>looking they've been here such a long<br>time some of the trees Queen Elizabeth<br>planted some trees here Governor<br>gray where we are now is the is the<br>conservation part of the campus it's the<br>grounds around Old Government house and<br>the historic buildings which is a<br>conservation<br>area and these grounds were originally<br>planted out in the uh 19th century um in<br>the<br>1800s they've been looked after by<br>generations of gardeners and ground<br>then the Gardens at the University are<br>more than just Gardens they are also a<br>really important International Botanical<br>collection and I know that the team uh<br>of gardeners and grounds people here<br>really do understand that importance and<br>when they're planning the gardens they<br>do take all of that into account and<br>work quite closely with our academic<br>staff and researchers in this<br>area<br>the gardens here are tremendously<br>helpful and what people may not consider<br>normally is we're right in the middle of<br>the city amongst tall buildings and<br>there are a lot of flowers and trees in<br>the garden which are pollinated and used<br>by bees for their nectar source that<br>happens all year round at different<br>times when they're<br>flowering the gardens are very important<br>for not only the bees but uh research as<br>well we're using the bees for a number<br>projects so on galip the whole Hillside<br>was full of these turkey spines and at<br>the end of the battle there was only one<br>left and then two Australian soldiers<br>took two cones with him at the end of<br>the battle they cloned these ones from<br>the original ones in Australia and they<br>gave for this one so this is a<br>gipo I feel very privileged to have my<br>name on the plk there and it is a great<br>symbol for us in New Zealand to be part<br>commemoration my kind of philosophy as a<br>gardener is that um or having been a<br>gardener a long time is that if a tree's<br>lived for 80 100 years it's got a right<br>to stay there unless it's absolutely a<br>health and safety issue can't be<br>there trees that are 100 years old are<br>getting less and less and when we lose<br>one of those trees you you can't replace<br>it<br>overnight we get a sense of things that<br>are bigger than us it takes us actually<br>out into the world and into the<br>expansiveness of the world reminding us<br>that we're quite small<br>really there's a real connection being a<br>Heritage to custodians that came way<br>before us so I look at the University as<br>being part of a being a gardener and a<br>legacy of of gardeners that were here<br>before the University was even<br>here<br>up<br>when walking through the gardens a<br>person should have the sense of the<br>gardens reflect Simplicity implicity<br>modesty naturalness and everydayness and<br>imperfection as well as silence and<br>balance this results in a garden which<br>is subtle and as unobstrusive<br>Beauty and engaging with the gardens is<br>just effortless and<br>pleasurable the garden should therefore<br>be in harmony with the buildings and<br>hard Scapes whilst promoting an<br>atmosphere of<br>tranquility and unity that uplifts staff<br>and student spirits that connect them<br>with plants and the role of plants play</p></main><footer
